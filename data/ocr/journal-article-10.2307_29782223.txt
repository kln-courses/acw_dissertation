A. 1937</page><page sequence="2">PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BY FIELD MUSEUM PRESS</page><page sequence="3">FOREWORD Dr. Hambly and I fully realize that this source book is far from perfect; yet an industrious and unbiased attempt has been made to bring together within the covers of one book a summary of all the most important facts that are known about Africa. This alone is a meritorious task, since the book contains more information about Africa, and a better bibliography of the literature for that continent, than any other work in English with which I am acquainted. Possibly the linguist, the physical anthropologist, and the archaeologist will hoist the flag of battle, will bear down on the section about which he knows most, and will utter loud protests. The charge will be that the section under fire is not adequately treated and that Dr. Hambly is not a ''specialist'' in that field. We freely admit that more might be written concerning any one of the many topics that are treated herein, but excess of detail would obscure the main issues and would add greatly to the cost of production. This source book merely attempts to assemble and discuss the significant results of anthropological work in Africa, and for this reason meets an urgent need. Paul S. Martin November 1,1987 13</page><page sequence="4">PREFACE In a recent presidential address to the Royal Anthropological Institute the Reverend E. W. Smith asked, "What do we know of Africa? The answer can be summed up in a few words: Very little as yet. Whatever department we examine, the tale is much the same. We have only scratched the surface of things hitherto. But it is something to see the immensity of the task confronting us if we are to gain sure knowledge of Africa and its inhabitants/' The truth of this statement might at first glance discourage the idea of preparing a general survey. But there is a strong argu? ment in favor of summarizing information gleaned up to the present, co-ordinating this knowledge, interpreting the data as far as possible, pointing out the unsolved problems, and so providing a basis for further research. No attempt has been made to compile an encyclopedia. Rather, an introductory textbook has been prepared, because experience has proved that students too often begin a study of some specific and in? tricate African problem without a groundwork of geography, biology, history, and general ethnology. To disarm the criticism of experts in linguistics, physical anthropology, and prehistory, it is necessary to emphasize the purpose of the book. The work is a general elementary introduction, which aims at presenting African people and their problems briefly, simply, and as a whole. In the address quoted, the President urges breadth of view in anthropological treatment. He advises that we "lift our eyes from the tasks in which we are engaged and take a glance at what our fellow workers are doing on the other side of the hedge, remembering that no one problem is solved until all problems are solved." Section I is a broad introduction to the salient facts of physiogra? phy, biology, archaeology, physical anthropology, and the distribu? tion of language families. The second section views the continent in the light of culture area concepts, with emphasis on the fact that these zones, though characterized by specific traits, are not isolated. The overlapping of zones is fully recognized, so as to avoid a false impression of simplicity and clear demarcation. In the third section the division of the great forest zone and its periphery into cultural subdivisions has not been attempted. The object has been merely to summarize and to classify the factual 15</page><page sequence="5">16 Source Book for African Anthropology material with which students will have to deal, since the time is not yet ripe for plotting the zones of distribution with precision. A task of this kind cannot be successfully attempted until additional field work has been done. Nevertheless, an approximate distribution of some traits is given, and certain broad areas of characterization are recognized, but in general the section is limited to a discussion of social, religious, and economic traits that can fairly be called funda? mental to Negro culture. Finally, the European period is introduced, with an account of exploration, partitioning among European powers, and a summary of the problems affecting the welfare of Africans under a foreign administration. The greatest danger arising from an attempt to condense is the tendency to leave a false impression of simplicity and finality. But a large bibliography is provided and fully used in the text to point the way to further exposition of debatable themes, whose expansion would make too great a demand on the space available. During the preparation of the Bibliography of Authors I have frequently had the advantage of advice and assistance from my librarian colleague, Eugene Victor Prostov, who kindly prepared the final bibliographical section dealing with sources for African research. These sources Mr. Prostov classified according to the political divisions of Africa. Maps and line drawings have been prepared by Staff Illustrator Carl F. Gronemann. For assistance in preparing the chapters on physical features and nature study I am indebted to my Field Museum colleagues. Dr. B. E. Dahlgren and Mr. Paul C. Standley, botanists; Dr. Wilfred H. Osgood, Mr. Karl P. Schmidt, Mr. Rudyerd Boulton, and Mr. A. C. Weed, zoologists; also Mr. Sharat K. Roy, geologist, all assisted in choice of literature, selection of photographs, and read? ing of proofs.

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND NATURE NOTES Physical Features Although the primary aim is a description of the cultures of Africa it is impossible to understand the great migrations and the modes of life, together with the distribution of languages and physical types, without a preliminary survey of the continent itself. The size, shape, and position of the land mass, the mountains and valleys, the river systems and lakes, and the distribution of minerals and types of soils have profoundly affected the history and development of Africans and Europeans. continental junctions and human migration Since theories of continental connection (Wegener, 1922, trans, by Skerl, 1924; and Perrier, 1925) relate to periods before the advent of man, they may be omitted. But the question of African-European land bridges in the early Pleistocene is of importance to anthro? pological study of Africa. Sollas (1924, p. 132) describes bridges by way of Malta and Sicily in the Chellean culture period of the Pleisto? cene, but these assumptions have been challenged recently (Wood? ward, 1935, p. 130). Students of African archaeology will therefore have to reserve their final judgments respecting human migrations in the early Pleistocene. Unless the geological time of subsidence of a land bridge is ascertained, a hypothesis for explaining the wanderings of people is extremely unreliable, but fortunately some land connection between Africa and Asia is known. The peninsula of Sinai in northeast Africa connects that continent with Arabia and farther Asia; and the justifiable assumption is that this land bridge has existed throughout the whole development and wanderings of man. At the southern end of the Red Sea the narrow strait of Bab-el-Mandeb separates Arabia from Africa, and ready transit between Arabia and Africa at this point was no doubt possible during a long prehistoric period even without a land bridge. The probability of such communication will be seen when we make a comparative study of the physical measurements of Arabs of southwest Arabia with anthropometric data for inhabitants of the opposite coast. 19</page><page sequence="14">20 Source Book for African Anthropology The latest discoveries of fossil mammals in the caves of Palestine and Syria, as interpreted by Miss Dorothea M. A. Bate, show that during the early half of the Pleistocene period, Asia and North Africa were much more closely connected than they have been since. The country was comparatively well watered, with luxuriant vegeta? tion and forests, and mammals could readily migrate both east and west. Even an animal so characteristic of Africa as the warthog (Phacochoerus) was then living in Palestine. The connection of Asia with Africa was thus as definite as the connection of Asia with Europe; and the explanation of the partial identity between the Pleistocene mammals of Africa and Europe is probably that they had a common source in Asia and diverged west in two different directions, one southwards, the other northwards (Woodward, 1935, p. 131). SIZE AND COAST LINE The area of Africa is twelve million square miles, four times that of the United States of America. The distance from north to south is about five thousand miles, and the breadth a few hundred miles less. Such great dimensions are best appreciated by remembering that the distance from New York to San Francisco is about three thousand miles. Africa is situated on the hottest part of the earth's surface. The continent is almost bisected by the equator; hence, the greater part of the land lies within the tropics. Africa has a coast line that is short and unbroken in relation to the great surface, and this fact is important in relation to climate, exploration, and commerce. The sea always has a moderating effect on land temperatures because water is more constant in temperature than a large mass of land. Consequently, proximity of the ocean tends to warm the land in winter and to cool it in summer. But the coast of Africa has inlets which are small in size and number compared with the surface area; hence the moderating effect of the sea on inland temperatures is not appreciable. In early days of exploration, journeys were made more difficult by the absence of inlets, and even as late as 1870 Stanley's name of the "Dark Conti? nent' ' was well chosen, since most of the interior was at that time unexplored. In addition to retarding exploration, the absence of natural harbors is an obstacle to commerce. At some ports on the west coast vessels anchor almost a mile from the shore to discharge passengers and cargoes into surf boats which are paddled ashore by native crews. But this natural disadvantage of the west coast is</page><page sequence="15">Physiography and Nature Notes 21 yielding to engineering skill, which has been directed toward building breakwaters and dredging natural inlets. SURFACE CONTOURS AND HUMAN LIFE In addition to location, shape, and coast line the biological importance of internal features should be considered. Deep depres? sions and high mountains affect climate, natural products, and the culture of the inhabitants. Mountains form barriers to communi? cation, while depressions like that of the Rift Valley in northeast Africa have determined the direction of migratory peoples. Volcanic disturbances have affected the survival and distribution of human and animal life, though doubtless many great cataclysms occurred before man had established himself in Africa. Yet Leakey (1936a, pp. 25-26) offers the hypothesis that a convulsion resulting in the formation of the Rift Valley led to the extinction of a very large number of species of animals that formerly flourished in Kenya, and he adds, "If my view is correct, it is not impossible that man too was wiped out in the regions round the Great Rift Valley. Certainly we know that whereas four distinct culture groups were in existence in Kenya before the formation of the Great Rift Valley, only two are present in the deposits which represent the period immediately following it." Africa is a plateau with an average height of two thousand feet above sea level. In east Africa the mountains Ruwenzori, Kenya, and Kilimanjaro are the principal elevations. Kilimanjaro, which is capped with snow throughout the year, attains a height of 19,321 feet, while Ruwenzori (16,800 feet) is an important elevation between lakes Albert and Albert Edward Nyanza; but Ruwenzori, unlike some adjacent mountains, is not an ancient volcano. Traveling from low to high altitudes gives a convincing demon? stration of the effects of elevation on temperatures. In a few hours the heat of the coast region of Portuguese West Africa can be exchanged for cold winds of a high plateau four thousand feet above the sea, where nightly temperatures fall almost to the freezing point. In Nigeria a journey northward from the coastal belt of dense, moist forests having a high temperature combined with great humidity leads to a plateau region whose nightly cold approaches freezing point. When the journey northward is continued for a few hundred miles the dry heat of the desert forms a sharp con? trast with the moist heat of the forest belt. In flat, open desert</page><page sequence="16">22 Source Book for African Anthropology great extremes of temperature are experienced between day and night, especially in the period from October to December when the Harmattan wind is blowing. This wind causes an exceptionally rapid fall of temperature after midnight. Before studying human life the basic fact has to be grasped that Africa, owing to vast area and differences in elevation, has many and varied ranges of temperature and moisture, with consequent diversity of plant and animal life. There exist, however, definite climatic zones which will be described later. Geological formation has affected climate, not only by determining elevation but by the formation of great lakes. Victoria Nyanza, which is twenty-six thousand square miles in area, also Mwero and Bangweolo, do not belong to the Rift Valley system, but occupy depressions in the general level of the plateau. On the contrary, lakes Tanganyika and Nyasa, both of which are valuable aids to communication, lie in the Rift Valley. Lake Tanganyika is of particular interest because of a rich fauna. Animal life includes many fish and mollusks peculiar to this lake, a fact which proves long isolation from other fresh-water systems. Geologi? cal factors have been responsible for the formation of lakes with their riverine connections, and these lacustrine features have influenced climate, communication, and food supply (J. W. Gregory: 1896; 1920, pp. 13-47; 1921. E. B. and S. Worthington, 1933). Willis (1936) in a section "Historical Retrospect" has surveyed theories of rift formation advanced since 1825. He compares the views of Beaumont, Suess, Gregory, Wayland, Krenkel, and others who have attempted to explain the way in which force may be exerted to cause a parting of the earth's crust, in such a manner that two or more adjacent strips become displaced and a rift valley is formed. The bearing of these geological arguments on human life will be fully realized in reading chapter III, which deals with culture sequences of the stone age. RIVERS AND HUMAN ENTERPRISE Formative influences which determined the height of the plateau regions, the position of valleys, and the direction of inclines also marked out the courses of four principal rivers, the Nile, Niger, Congo, and Zambezi, for the details of which Fitzgerald (1934) should be consulted. Of these the Nile is the most familiar because of its Biblical connection and the mystery which surrounded its source and annual</page><page sequence="17">Physiography and Nature Notes 23 rise. So far back as A.D. 60 the Roman Emperor Nero sent two centurions on a journey of discovery, and their record shows that the expedition penetrated the marshes of the upper Nile, where live the tall Nilotic Negroes, Dinkas, Shilluks, Nuers, and Anuak. The impressive stature of these tribes was described, and in addition to this the centurions mentioned their difficulty in cutting a way through the floating vegetation of the marshes. In the year 400 B.c. the Greek philosopher Aristotle guessed at the cause of floods along the course of the Nile, when he stated that the annual rise of the river was due to the melting of snow combined with summer rains in Ethiopia (Abyssinia), where the tributaries Blue Nile and Atbara have their origin. Usually the Nile rises at the end of June and continues in flood until the end of September, when a height of twenty-five feet above low level is generally recorded at Cairo. Should the rise exceed this there is danger to life and property, but an abnormally low rise means famine and poverty. The civilization of Egypt, which is one of the most impressive instances of the growth of a complex culture, has depended on this annual overflow of the river, which left a deposit of mud and a sur? plus of water that could be conducted for long distances through irrigation canals. Modern engineering, especially the dam at Assuan, is an apt instance of man's successful effort to make himself less dependent on natural phenomena, for the waters can now be impounded and released at will. That the Egyptians themselves fully realized their dependence on the flooding of the Nile Valley is clear from their mythology and sacred texts. The old Egyptian word quern refers to the deposit of black mud left by the receding waters, and the ta-mera of ancient Egyptian literature describes the inundation. The following brief paragraph will serve to illustrate the influence of geographical con? ditions on economic welfare and spiritual beliefs. Egyptians of 3500 B.c. had certainly no accurate knowledge of the true source of the river and the cause of its floods. Sacred texts refer to the Nile god as the "hidden one" whose "secret places" were a matter for conjecture. Mythology taught that the Nile surrounded the whole world, and that the river was part of a celestial ocean on which sailed the boats of the Sun god. Egyptian pictures show the source of the Nile as a cavern guarded by a hippopotamus-headed goddess who is armed with a large knife. Another illustration por? trays two gods wearing papyrus and lotus blossoms respectively; one of the deities represents the northern and the other the southern</page><page sequence="18">24 Source Book for African Anthropology part of the river. One picture shows a Nile god in his cavern pour? ing out the waters of the White and Blue Niles. A hymn to the Nile god has been translated from a papyrus in the British Museum. Thou waterest the fields which Ra hath created. Thou givest life unto all animals. Thou art the friend of bread and drink. Thou fillest the storehouse and makest the granaries to overflow. The River Congo, though shorter than the Nile by a thousand miles, has a greater volume of water than any other African river. The length of the Congo is three thousand miles?about the breadth of the United States. The river is not straight, however, but makes a large northward curve which acts as a drainage system for the for? ested area of central Africa. The wide estuary is situated about the middle of the west coast. Far from the shore the sea is yellow in color, and at the point where the incoming tide clashes with the out? ward rush of the river a bar of foam, seaweed, and driftwood has been formed. The Niger, with a length of 2,600 miles, makes a great horseshoe formation in west Africa. For more than two thousand years the location of the estuary was unknown, and no river, with the excep? tion of the Nile, has been of such great historic interest. The Niger and its tributary Benue are the principal water highways for the whole of west Africa. The Zambezi, 1,600 miles long, drains a large area in the southeast of the continent. The process of differential erosion is of importance in connection with a study of river systems, because the unequal hardness of the strata has led to formation of cataracts that have impeded explora? tion and commercial development. On the Nile are four cataracts. The Niger is obstructed by the Busa Rapids. The Yalala Falls obstruct the Congo. Narrowing of the River Zambezi at the Vic? toria Falls provided crossings above and below the cataract, and over these constrictions of the river passed human migrations from the east side of the continent. MINERALS AND CIVILIZATION The early geological processes, including tilting of strata, have been responsible for the outcropping of mineral deposits that have affected human activities both ancient and modern, from the time when stone-age man sought beds of flint, until the recent rush for gold and diamonds. The oasis of Kharga is situated a hundred miles west-by-south of Abydos on the River Nile. Airplane photographs taken by Lady Bailey indicate that the part of the Libyan desert in which the oasis</page><page sequence="19">Physiography and Nature Notes 25 is situated is a scene of complete desolation, though the oasis itself contains wells and the remains of conduits cut by Romans and Persians. Miss Caton-Thompson (1931a, 1931b, 1932) states that Kharga shows one of the most remarkable flint-chipping areas that it can ever have been the lot of man to see. Here are querns and hand rubbers for grinding grain, flint flakes, and chipped axes. A more advanced technique is illustrated by translucent flint arrowheads, and there is evidence of a stone-age industry which in some of its aspects antedated the historical period (4000 B.c.) by thousands of years. Evidently the early sites of stone-age man were geologically determined by the presence of suitable material. During millions of years the mineral wealth of Africa lay untouched, until at last man discovered the economic importance of metals and made them play a part in his culture. The mining and forging of iron by Negroes has given rise to several hypotheses respecting the origin and dispersal of these industries. But, what? ever the history may be, the fact remains that iron ore is abundant near the surface, and the blacksmith's art was well developed among Negroes before the arrival of Europeans. The origin of the bronze-casting industry of west Africa is un? known, but the art flourished before the European period began, and the making of the alloy depended on the occurrence of tin and copper. Again, the copper mines of Katanga in the southern Belgian Congo have been important in human affairs in both ancient and modern times. The eagerness of Europeans to exploit these mines has led to the development of new railways and river-boat services. Before the use of European currencies became general, copper from Katanga was made into large units of exchange shaped like a letter X, and this currency was carried far and wide by native caravans. Mungo Park (1799, p. 285) described native methods of washing the soil for gold in west Africa. Some of the valuable metal was fashioned into personal ornaments, but much of it in the form of gold dust was traded across the western Sahara to Teghaza in ex? change for salt from that region. The native gold industry lured Europeans, who finally explored and annexed the country. History of the Union of South Africa is concerned with the cupidity of prospectors and company promoters who have coveted the gold and diamond mines. In this scramble for wealth the inter? ests of native Africans have generally been neglected. Negroes have gathered from long distances in response to demands for labor in the</page><page sequence="20">26 Source Book for African Anthropology mines, and not infrequently they have failed to understand the nature of the labor contracts to which they agreed. Moreover, work under? ground and the life in compounds have proved physically and morally injurious, while native social organization has been disrupted at its source by withdrawal of the male population. For a time Chinese labor was introduced into the mines, but the resulting complications of a social and political kind led to the discontinuance of this practice. Clearly, the presence of gold and diamonds, a geological factor, has determined the course of south African history, and in Lunda, northeast Angola, the social conditions of Africans are deeply affected by the presence of diamond mines. Although Gautier (1928) doubts the maritime formation of the Sahara (p. 5) he rightly insists on the biological and historical impor? tance of salt deposits. Teghaza in the northwest Sahara has through? out historical times been important for production of salt, an industry which has proved a stimulus to caravan trade, and a cause of com? mercial rivalry and warfare. From Bilma in the southern Sahara salt cakes are traded east, west, and south, and the supplies are still responsible for annual caravan trade on a large scale between Bilma and the southeast side of the Air Mountains. Buchanan (1926, p. 73) describes the concourse from the great trade centers of Kano, Katsina, Sokoto, and Zinder, until a caravan of seven thousand camels was assembled at Air. Another valuable deposit that influ? ences human activities is the beds of natron on the shores of Lake Chad. The oval cakes are traded for long distances since the potash is a valuable ingredient in the drinking water of domestic animals (Vischer, 1910, p. 301). Fig. 1 shows the unloading of cakes of natron at Baya Seyarum on the western shore of Lake Chad. Trade in minerals resulting directly from geological factors, has been responsible for great physical, cultural, and linguistic interchanges. Without dogmatic acceptance of a theory of geographic deter? minism the control of geographic factors over human life can clearly be demonstrated for the continent of Africa. Our future studies of culture areas will illustrate the adaptability of man, but the data will likewise stress his limitations. Advances in engineering and biological science will profoundly affect the present status of human communities in Africa, solving old problems of adjustment and creating new ones. But throughout this flux nature will play a part, perhaps capriciously by climatic changes, and the picture is one of unending battle to secure a series of temporary adjustments between man and his environment.</page><page sequence="21">I PQ to ? o g 27</page><page sequence="22">28 Source Book for African Anthropology future research To prepare the way for future anthropological study better maps of Africa are needed. I thought when traveling in Angola in the year 1929 that available maps were astonishingly incomplete and inaccu? rate. For many parts of Africa revision of the spelling of place and tribal names is urgent. The confusion and difficulty likely to arise from preparing a gazetteer of tribal names will be realized by consulting J. Maes and 0. Boone (1935), whose excellent summary of Belgian Congo tribes shows that certain tribal names may be spelled in a dozen different ways. Sometimes the names are entirely differ? ent though they designate the same people. In topographical research there is need of great endeavor; for example, on the subject of soil erosion (Hobley, 1933; Champion, 1933), and the utilization of underground supplies of water (A. B. Thompson, 1933). The local geological researches of E. J. Wayland (1934) in Uganda are typical of the concentrated surveys necessary to explain human prehistory in geological terms. E. B. and S. Worthington (1933) have directed attention to the geological and biological importance of the lake systems of east Africa, but many more studies of this type are required. To expand these introductory remarks and to prepare the way for intelligent comprehension of Africa as a whole several types of literature are available. READING RECOMMENDED For one beginning a course on Africa I would recommend as preliminary general reading a few of the older books (Drummond, 1899; W. Reade, 1864, 1872), outmoded, perhaps, yet of human qualities, humor, and insight that preserve their value. The summary of E. W. Smith (1935) should be carefully read, and as elementary textbooks C. G. Seligman (1930) and Hambly (1930a) will provide useful introductions. In German, Buschan (1922) has provided a digest of African ethnology. Both Hambly and Buschan are concerned principally with the material cultures of geographical zones. Huxley (1931a) has given in "Africa View" a gen? eral survey of the geological and biological factors entering into human life in east Africa, together with an appraisal of educational and social problems. R. R. Marett's "Anthropology" (1912) is a bright and stimulating introduction, touching on the antiquity of man, race, environment, language, social organization, law, religion, and morality.</page><page sequence="23">Physiography and Nature Notes 29 The general theory of geographic determinism is expounded by Huntington (1907, 1914, 1915, 1926), Semple (1914), C. E. P. Brooks (1925), Forde (1934), Pomfret (1935), and Bowman (1934). The most comprehensive modern work in French is "La g^ographie humaine" in three volumes by Brunhes (1925). W. M. Davis (1911) has contributed a helpful discussion showing the role of geographical factors in the development of South Africa. Dixon (1928) has provided valuable summaries of the geographical and many other important factors that are instrumental in building a culture pattern. Dixon is not specifically concerned with Africa but with general principles that can be applied to African study. As an example of the detailed study of local conditions in relation to human life Hudson's (1935) survey of a district in Northern Rhodesia is recommended. Among works of reference of an encyclopedic kind various hand? books are available. The "South and East African Year Book," with atlas (S. and G. G. Brown, 1935), also "Uganda" (Thomas and Scott, 1935), are typical source books available in preparation for regional research. Other thesaurian works of value in African research are Keane (1907), Gsell (1913), Krenkel (1925, 1928), and Haughton (1935). E. Torday's revision (1930) of Herbert Spencer's "Descrip? tive Sociology of African Races" contains a map with tribal locations designated by numbers, a key to which is provided. Roome (1925) has published a tribal map that will prove of service, though great improvement is necessary when further study has given tribal taxonomy a sure foundation on somatic, linguistic, and cultural grounds. We need some logical tribal grouping. A large folding orographical map published by the National Geographic Magazine, Washington (1935), gives political divisions, railways, and motor roads. Sources of information respecting maps are the National Geographic Society, South Kensington, London; E. Stanford, 43 Whitehall, London; H. M. Stationery Office, Kings way, London; the Royal Anthropological Institute; and the Inter? national Institute of African Languages and Cultures, London. Fitzgerald's compendium of African geography (1934) contains ninety maps, and the work is an indispensable companion for African study. Of these sources for cartography perhaps Stanford is the most valuable, since his catalogue contains lists and specimens of maps in great variety. Use also the Times Atlas. With this equipment a beginning may be made in the study of climatic and biological conditions in relation to human development.</page><page sequence="24">30 Source Book for African Anthropology Climate cultural changes Anthropologists are primarily concerned with African climatic zones as they exist today, and with the climatic changes that have affected human development since the beginning of the Pleistocene period; hypotheses relating to more ancient changes are only of theoretical interest (Skerl, p. 22). Geological and climatic changes have resulted in a discontinuous distribution of fossils and living animals. Lakes have dried up, and forests once continuous are now separated by hundreds of miles of parkland and semi-desert. The principal geological events of the Pleistocene period, with which our study of human life begins, were the alternating advances and retreats of the polar ice sheets in the northern hemisphere, and there is the possibility that these Pleistocene glaciations were con? temporaneous throughout the world. Present research seeks to correlate European glaciations with changes of humidity in Africa, and a scheme of synchrony between European glaciations and east African pluvial periods has been prepared (E. W. Smith, 1935, p. 16) from the data of E. J. Wayland (1934), Leakey (1935), and C. E. P. Brooks (1931). As an illustrative study of the relationship between climate and man in south Africa an article by Smuts (1932) may be quoted as an example of the regional research which is only in its infancy. The author uses the events of the Pleistocene as a general framework for geological and climatic events both in Europe and south Africa. He points out that "we have now reached a stage in our south African archaeology when we may fairly use the Pleistocene as a working hypothesis, testing it with the geological and archaeological knowl? edge we have already gathered." Table I (Smuts, 1932, p. 101) enumerates Pleistocene periods and climates in Europe; then follows a description of European terminology from pre-Chellean through Mousterian and Aurignacian to Solutrean phases, thence to Magda lenian, Azilian, and Tardenoisian cultures. Table II, headed "European Pleistocene," gives a sequence of hypothetical dates with their associated climates, stone cultures, and types of fossil man, and a similar table (p. 108) is given for east African climates. Table VI makes chronological comparison between European Pleistocene glaciations, south African pluvial phases, and the occurrence of the lower, middle, and upper stone-age artifacts in south Africa. Doubtless, geologists and archaeologists might find herein much for contention, and a student must accept the schemes as tentative.</page><page sequence="25">Physiography and Nature Notes 31 The actual degree of accuracy in correlation is not the important point; we are concerned chiefly with a method whose extension to parts of Africa other than the north, east, and south may ultimately lead to a better understanding of the relationship between geological events, climatic change, and cultural sequences. General Smuts emphasizes the logical connection between the sciences. Speaking of south Africa he says (p. 112), "Our inadequate geology is now impeding our further progress in archaeology/' but he points out that the necessary advance is being made by C. van Riet Lowe, who is collating evidence of pluvial periods in the Pleisto? cene from study of the terraces of the Vaal River. In connection with the subject of climatic changes, and their effects on human and animal life, L. S. B. Leakey's chapter entitled "Glimpses of Kenya's Past" (1936b) provides a non-technical intro? duction. For another area, the Sahara, Gautier (1928, Mayhew's translation, 1935, pp. 54, 60-61, 109) affords an excellent summary of geological and climatic changes with emphasis on the relation of these to human, plant, and animal life. Gautier states (p. 61), "The facts which we have established then are these: that the Sahara appears to have been a desert during very remote and diverse geological eras. But in the Quaternary age, which was the geological period immediately preceding our own, a sharp change of climate in respect to humidity was experienced in the Sahara as well as in Europe and other parts of the world. During this period portions of the Sahara were furrowed by mighty rivers, and for the desert was temporarily substituted the steppe, thus opening to the tropical fauna a route to the Mediterranean." The Saharan rivers were not, however, powerful enough to reach the sea and to establish normal drainage. During the moist period the Atlas Mountains became the home of a residual fauna, some of which remained in existence even into our own historical times. The Carthaginian elephant was one of the last relics of this fauna, and the animal might have survived longer but for the depredations of Roman ivory hunters. CLIMATE AND POPULATION In studying human settlement in relation to humidity and tem? perature some figures collated by Westermann (1934, p. 303, quoting R. Uhden, 1931) deserve consideration, and these should be studied with reference to Fitzgerald's maps (Figs. 8, 9, pp. 34-35; Fig. 10, p. 41; and Fig. 14, p. 108), showing distribution of temperatures, rainfall, population, and types of vegetation.</page><page sequence="26">32 Source Book for African Anthropology Westermann states, "The present population of Africa according to recent census figures is about 130 millions, possibly less, making a density of four persons per square kilometer. In the steppe lands, most of which do not allow of agriculture but are fit only for cattle nomads, as, for example, in the region south of the Sahara, there is scarcely one person (in French Equatorial Africa 1.5) per square kilometer. Even in the forest district of the Congo where there is an abundant supply of rain the population reaches only 1-1.5 per square kilometer. The savannah lands show a relatively dense population. In northern Nigeria the density rises to almost 46. The greatest congestion is found in the oases of the Sahara and in a few favored places, as on the southern slopes of Kilimanjaro, where 125 persons live on one square kilometer. Kavirondo is also a densely populated country. The greatest density is reached in Egypt. The valley of the Nile has 400 persons per square kilometer, and the purely agricultural Egyptian province Menufie 684." Vegetation Zones For our present purpose a simplified diagram (Map 2) will suffice to indicate the climatic zones that are of primary importance in the study of plant life and culture areas. Zone 1 is equatorial forest, which occupies a broad belt north and south of the equator. A narrower, westerly continuation of this belt stretches along the coastal region, which comprises the political divisions of Cameroons, Nigeria, Dahomey, Ashanti, the Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. This dense forest region is one of great humidity combined with a fairly high but constant temperature. Near Lagos, for example, the average temperature is about 80? with little variation either seasonally or by day and night. This is not an exceedingly high temperature, but owing to excess of moisture the heat is oppressive (Fig. 2, b). At Kano in northern Nigeria a dry heat of even 150? is not so enervating. Zone 2 is modified equatorial forest. The rainfall is less and the vegetation is more sparse than in Zone 1. Zone 3 is parkland having adequate moisture, scattered forest, and open plains with tall grass that gives shelter to herds of antelope. In the eastern parkland zone are the largest herds of big game, and many regions within the zone are suitable for raising cattle (Fig. 2, a, Fig. 3). Zone 4 is true desert of stones or billowy sand interrupted by high plateau some of which is volcanic and attains a height of eight</page><page sequence="27">?P_?* _^_IP_V_v-_??_ Map 2.

Fertile oases depending on permanent under? ground water occur at wide intervals. Rainfall is either non-existent, or heavy rains may occur locally at long intervals and for very short periods (Figs. 4, 5). Zone 5 is a grassland area of moderately high temperature and seasonal rainfall, sometimes with droughts. The region is transi? tional from parkland to semi-desert. Zone 6 is semi-desert with high temperature and scanty rain? fall, somewhat uncertain in time and quantity. The chief vegetation is thorny scrub, euphorbias and areas of coarse grass (Figs. 6,11, a). Zone 7 is of a warm, temperate, Mediterranean type with local variations of heat and moisture due to differences in elevation. Examination of Map 2 shows a repetition of climatic zones north and south of the equator. Modified forest and parkland, also grasslands, are to be found surrounding the dense equatorial forest. In the southwest is a strip of coastal desert and semi-desert, and warm temperate zones occur in the extreme northwest and southeast of the continent. The comparisons of temperature, rainfall, and vegetation in these zones, which have somewhat similar locations north and south of the equator, are only approximate. Similar climates have not, however, imposed a uniformity of human modes of life. In the Kalahari Desert Bushman hunters have met conditions in their own itinerant way, but without any livestock. On the contrary, nomads of the corresponding semi desert region north of the equator keep horses, cattle, and possibly camels. In the dry steppes of Kordofan, the whole organization is seasonally changed by splitting a tribe into small bands, .each of which under its sheikh settles near a waterhole for the dry season. RAINFALL It is undesirable to give here statistics of rainfall, since these are readily available in the works of Fitzgerald (1934) and Knox (1911), but two extremes are portions of Cameroons, with an annual fall of 300 inches, and the region of Walfish Bay in the southwest, with an annual record of 0.3 inch, an almost negligible supply. The wet seasons are reversed north and south of the equator. Thus in Angola the dry season extends from April to the end of September, then in the period September to March rains come from the northwest. North of the equator, for instance, in Nigeria, heavy rainfall occurs between April and October, but following the final tornadoes of</page><page sequence="30"></page><page sequence="31">36^ ^</page><page sequence="32"></page><page sequence="33">38 Source Book for African Anthropology November the dry season sets in. In some areas of Africa the distribution of rainfall is more complicated than that described, for in addition to the two main seasons, wet and dry, periods of the "little rains" are important (F. Jung, 1932; W. Koops, 1935). Since mountains and plateaus intercept moisture, rainfall depends on elevation. In Angola the wet winds originating in the northwest are bereft of moisture before they reach the coast; consequently, a strip of seaboard has in some years a fall that is scarcely measurable. The dryness of the Sahara Desert is due to deflection of moisture laden winds whose direction is determined by the shape of the Gulf of Guinea. The forest region of the Guinea coast has a heavy fall, but by the time the winds have reached the southern Sahara they are dry. In the far northwest of Africa westerly winds bring moisture to Algeria and Morocco, but the Atlas Mountains intercept the greater part of the downpour. Hence, the winds are dry when they reach the northern Sahara, and that area is screened from a supply of rain on both its southern and northern extremities. The Kalahari Desert in the southwest of the continent results from similar causes. Southeast trade winds bring a heavy fall of rain to Zone 7 at the coast, but after crossing the high country they reach the Kalahari as dry winds. These facts are of primary importance in studying section II, "Culture Areas." INTRODUCED PLANTS The history of each plant provides a theme for inquiry that leads into a wide field of literature, especially that relating to early voyages of discovery. If a plant is not indigenous to Africa, research tries to discover the first dependable date of introduction, the country of origin, and the point at which it was introduced into the new habitat. If botanical, linguistic, and historical research is successful, there is a possibility of tracing the routes along which the plant was dispersed, the agencies of dispersal, the reasons for acceptance or rejection, and the part played by the innovation in modifying cultures. B. Laufer (1919) emphasizes a point of distinction between the introduction of a plant itself and the adoption of a custom associated with the plant. For example, indigo plants are indigenous to Africa, but the custom of making dye from them may have been introduced by Arabs who recognized the plants and knew how to utilize them. A similar argument applies to the henna plant and its use as a cos? metic. Cotton plants and gourds (Cucurbita) are of doubtful origin.</page><page sequence="34">39</page><page sequence="35">40 Source Book for African Anthropology Castor-oil plants are possibly indigenous and coffee is a native of Africa. Probably Africa is indebted to Asia for the banana, jack fruit, coconut palm, date palm, fig, flax, millet, olives, sugar cane, and rice. But most recent research makes it doubtful whether rice cultivation began in China, India, or Africa (Nature, vol. 138, 1936, p. 1104, Editorial note). The evidence supporting such hypothesis is viewed in detail by A. de Candolle (1890) whose work remains a classic, and more recently by B. Laufer (1919) in "Sino Iranica." Alldridge (1901) has published a very useful and well Fig. 7. Baobab tree and semi-desert scenery (from painting by Field Museum Staff Artist, Charles A. Corwin). illustrated book describing cultivated products and forest timbers, not from the historical but from a practical point of view. Some of the most important food plants of Africa were introduced from America during the period of slave trade between the west coast of Africa, Brazil, and the West Indies. At present millions of Africans use as their staple crop maize, which was introduced into west Africa by Portuguese voyagers, probably early in the sixteenth century. This grain is grown in forest clearings, but it thrives best of all in upland regions where tropical heat is tempered by elevation. The plateau regions of central Angola provide ideal situations for</page><page sequence="36">Physiography and Nature Notes 41 cultivation of maize in large quantities. The history of the intro? duction of maize and a note on the slow acceptance of the grain as a food for human beings is given by Hambly (1934a, p. 118) from unpublished notes supplied by the late Dr. Lauf er. From America came groundnuts (peanuts), Arachis hypogaea, which are now widely cultivated for food by Negro tribes and in some localities for export. The nuts were brought in slave ships to serve as food on the return voyage. In northern Nigeria during November the groundnut crop for export stimulates an extensive caravan trade near Kano. Another valuable contribution from America is manioc, a root crop, several species of which are cultivated in forest clearings over an enormous area in the forest and parkland. The New World contributed sweet potatoes (Ipomaea Batatas), a, tropical vine of Convolvulaceae. Yams (genus Dioscorea), of which Dioscorea sativa and Dioscorea alata are the most common varieties, are cultivated in Africa. Probably all the cultivated yams of Africa are of Old World origin. Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), probably American in origin, are somewhat widely cultivated in open country such as that of central Angola. The papaya (Carica Papaya) and the guava, a shrub of the genus Psidium, have been introduced from America, but though appreciated by Europeans, the fruits of these trees cannot be said to form an important item of native diet. The introduction of tobacco from America has had an important influence on African culture, trade, and social customs, with which the use of this narcotic has become associated (Laufer, Linton, Hambly, 1930). This leaflet summarizes historical evidence for introduction and diffusion of the commodity, and information is given respecting cultivation, preparation of smoker's tobacco and snuff, the associated habits, and types of apparatus used for smoking. A few brief notes on plants of economic importance which are characteristic of Zones 1-7 may now be added. zone 1 In Zone 1, the central equatorial region of great heat and mois? ture, the most important products are the palms and the banana. The wine palm, Raphia vinifera, sometimes called the bamboo palm, produces a sap that yields an intoxicating drink when fermented; from the base of the leaf a fiber named piassava is obtained. The oil palm, Elaeis guineensis (Fig. 8, b), the raffia palms (Fig. 10, a), and the coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, are all of great economic value. In the forest zones of west Africa men mount the trunks of oil and wine palms by placing their feet flat against the trunk of the</page><page sequence="37">42 Source Book for African Anthropology tree and leaning backward on a fiber rope that supports the body. The climber advances upward by a series of jerks until he nears the head of the tree. He then uses his machete to cut slits to which small gourds are attached for collection of the sap, in case of the wine palm (Forde, 1937b, p. 43). From an oil palm he cuts off clusters of nuts (Fig. 10, 6). Sarbah (1908, pp. 232-250) has given a useful account of the oil palm. The thick, reddish juice is a staple ingredient in vegetable stews, and large quantities of the oil are exported for making soap. Coconut palms thrive in the east and west coastal, equatorial regions, and the dried kernels, known as copra, are exported for making soap and candles. In Sierra Leone the cores from clusters of oil palm nuts, when burned, yield potash for use in making soap (Alldridge, 1910, p. 336). From the leaves of the raffia palm many Negro tribes make fiber skirts, mats, and baskets. Raffia fibers are dyed and woven into colored patterns with simple looms. The raffia weaving of the Bushongo in the southwest Congo region and of some tribes of southern Nigeria is of great artistic merit. The use of the banana (Musa) in the forest zone is well exempli? fied by Kollmann (1899, p. 12) who describes the place of this fruit in the domestic economy of the Waganda tribe. "He cooks the banana in large earthen pots covered by banana leaves. He roasts it at the fire; crushes meal from it; uses the fibres for all kinds of wicker work, and for tying up and fastening his work; the leaves serve him as table cloth; from the viscous sap of the trunk he pre? pares a kind of soap; and a valuable drink somewhat like lemonade, and greatly liked by Europeans, is obtained from the fruit." Not everywhere in the tropical zone does the banana function so impor? tantly, but the account is typical of the way in which domestic economy focuses about one or more principal vegetable products. Rice flourishes in hot moist regions, but it has a sporadic and not a general distribution in Africa. Rice is grown in Sierra Leone, along the upper Niger, near Lake Chad, in the Nile Delta, near the sources of the Congo and the Kasai, in Tanganyika, especially in a coastal strip south of Zanzibar, and over a large part of Madagascar. Production of sugar cane in a strip on the west coast north and south of the equator, sporadically in the Nile Valley, in southeast Africa, and in northeast Madagascar is principally a European enter? prise employing native labor. The distribution of maize in Zone 1 is very wide, since the plant can be cultivated in forest clearings, although it grows better still</page><page sequence="38">h Fig. 8. a.

Oil palm, Elaeis guineensis. 43</page><page sequence="39">44 Source Book for African Anthropology in more open country bordering the denser forest. The grain thrives in fairly high plateau regions to an elevation of 4,000 feet. Generally the grain is grown by natives for their own consumption as a staple food and for brewing beer, but a large area in south Africa is devoted to production of maize for export. Fitzgerald (1934, Fig. 30, p. 192) shows the most intensive cultivation to lie north and south of Basutoland. Before 1820, maize (Indian corn), which is known in south Africa as mealies, was little known in Cape Colony and not until 1880 was its production of any consequence. Maize, though little used as food by Europeans in south Africa, is the staple of native diet, and in 1928 more than half a million tons was exported. Manioc (cassava), Manihot utilissima, is very commonly used as food in the forest area and a broad periphery of that region. The Ovimbundu distinguish five varieties by name and have for each a specific method of cultivation and preparation for food (Hambly, 1934a, pp. 146-147). Yams and sweet potatoes, together with maize and manioc, are the four staples of a mid-section of Africa covering more than a third of the total area. They are all rich in starch, but in regions where the oil palm thrives the oil is added to crushed yams, so giving a mixed diet. The wealth of timber in forests of Zone 1 is to a great extent unexploited but research goes forward at schools of forestry such as that established at Ibadan in Nigeria. Negro wood-carving in hard mahogany and ebony has attained maximum development in the Ivory Coast, Ashanti, Dahomey, Nigeria, Cameroons, and the southwest Congo. Study of trees, their properties, and the extent to which the timbers are utilized has been too frequently neglected by ethnologists. Hambly (1934a, pp. 138-140, 161) has given a list of Umbundu names for trees, together with notes on the economic values of the timbers to the Ovimbundu. Unwin (1920) and H. H. Johnston (1906) have prepared descriptions of west African forests and forestry; the former is technical, the latter pictorial and popular. A useful technical work on west African forestry has been compiled by J. Hutchinson and J. M. Dalziel (1931). ZONES 2 AND 3 In Zone 2, which is a region of attenuated forest and parkland, and in Zone 3, which is a transition area from thin bush to semi desert, several staple grains are produced. Here a student will encounter difficulties in nomenclature. Some clarification of naming is given by Robbins and Ramaley (1933). "Sorghum is related to some of the common American</page><page sequence="40">^^^^^ 45</page><page sequence="41">46 Source Book for African Anthropology prairie grasses of the genus Andropogon, and indeed sorghum is sometimes considered as belonging to that genus, but at present it is more often designated as Holcus Sorghum. The plants require high temperatures and are sensitive to cold; they can resist drought since they have a low water requirement and are not readily injured by hot winds. The sorghums have relatively few diseases and insect enemies." Durra is a sorghum widely cultivated in the eastern Sudan and northeast Africa under climatic conditions that give no rainfall from September to May. In west Africa durra is locally called Guinea corn, and in south and southeast Africa, Kafir corn. "The term millet does not refer to a definite botanical group (species, genus, or tribe). Agriculturally speaking, the word 'millet' now embraces a number of annual cereal and forage grasses which have comparatively small seeds, abundant foliage, and fibrous root system. Most millets belong to the genera Chaetochloa, Echinochloa, Panicum, Pennisetum, and Eleusine. The water requirement of millets is less than that of the sorghums." (Robbins and Ramaley, 1933, pp. 90-92.) Eleusine is a genus which is composed of grasses with many flowered spikelets. Eleusine coracana is a valuable edible grain cultivated in India and east Africa. Sesame (simsim) is an East Indian herb; Sesamum indicum has flattish seeds which, owing to their oil content, have a nutritive value. K. Schumann (Editor, A. Engler, 1895, pp. 31-87) has given a section of his compendium to a description of maize, millets, eleusine, sorghums, and other nutritious grasses of east Africa, and a key to cultivated varieties of durra in this region is added. In the western part of Zone 2, where the forest becomes more sparse, several trees are of great economic importance. Borassus flabellifer var. aethiopum (Fig. 9, a), a variety of the Palmyra palm of India, is known in Liberia as the fan palm. This palm has large round fan-shaped leaves which are used by the natives for thatching, for basketry, and as writing tablets. Sugar and wine are made from the sap. The fruits can be eaten either roasted or pre? served, and when ripe they yield a yellow dye. The dum palm (doum, or dorn), Hyphaene thebaica (Fig. 9, 6), provides pliant straw for making mats, hats, baskets, and bags. These palms can thrive in somewhat arid areas of Zone 5. The shea-butter tree, Butyrospermum Parkii, of the dry savanna lands, has a variety of uses. A solid white fat is obtained from the</page><page sequence="42">47</page><page sequence="43">48 Source Book for African Anthropology seeds, and this can be used either as food or as an illuminant. Meek (1925, vol. 1, p. 143) and M. Park (p. 203) have described shea-butter and the manufacture of soap from this fat. Another conspicuous tree of the dry zone and one which extends into semi-desert regions is the baobab (Fig. 7), Adansonia digitata (Verdoorn, 1933). Accord? ing to Meek (1925, vol. 1, p. 146) the flour crushed from the fruit is used in making porridge known as kunu, and the leaves are a season? ing for soup. The Fulani frequently add baobab pod juice to their milk, and the bark fiber is used locally for door curtains, knapsacks, string, and ropes. The name kola is applied to a large genus of African trees of the chocolate family (Sterculiaceae) having capsular fruits containing large seeds. Cola acuminata, often known as Cola vera, furnish most of the kola nuts of commerce. In west Africa the nuts are cere? monially handed at receptions. Their caffeine content gives them value as a stimulant. In the Nupe country of Nigeria, north of the denser forest zone, groves of kola trees are cultivated and nuts are produced for export. Further research would be of interest in collating infor? mation about the customs associated with the use of kola nuts. Thus, in establishing a blood brotherhood between two men a nut is divided, and each of the men eats that part of the nut which is smeared with the blood of his "brother." The distribution of the indigo plant and its uses have been dis? cussed by Lauf er (1919, pp. 370-371, 585) and some notes on the subject of dyeing with indigo in west Africa have been collated by Hambly (1935a, pp. 415-417). Meek has described the routine of work on a present-day indigo farm (1925, vol. 1, p. 123). In the dry regions throughout Zone 6 acacias yield various gums of commerce. Bartholomew (1912, p. 38) indicates on an economic map of Africa a distribution of gum-exuding trees in Mauretania and in the hinterland of Morocco and Algeria. The region of distribution extends across Africa in the dry Zone 6, border? ing the southern Sahara and extending through Kordofan, to the east of the Nile and into Abyssinia. Throughout this long but narrow belt the gathering of gums, bringing them to local markets, and packing them for export are of great economic and social im? portance, since the industry determines native modes of life. zone 4 In the oases of Zone 4, which is the true desert, and in the Nile Valley, date palms (Phoenix dactylifera) are of primary importance.</page><page sequence="44">Pi1" ' i '???iMfittMMi^^^M^WB CO Q) CD fi 49</page><page sequence="45">50 Source Book for African Anthropology Dates are dried and carried as human food on long journeys, and as food for camels in the region of Kufra and other eastern oases. Notes on the cultivation of dates, their grades, domestic use, and preparation for export from Siwa have recently been given by Cline (1936a, p. 24). The account, which contains many important historical references, is an excellent example of the aggregation of social and economic traits about a single staple plant (Fig. 8, a). Among wild produce of the true desert (Zone 4) and the arid region (Zone 6), the thorny acacias are of first-rate importance since they afford almost the only browsing for camels, and such browsing is essential for maintenance of health, even though the animals are fed with dates or with durra. zone 7 In the temperate zones (Map 2, No. 7) cereals of the European type are grown. Wheat, barley, and oats are important crops in lands having climate of the Mediterranean type; so also are grapes, olives, figs, lemons, and peaches. The Kabyles of northwest Africa show great industry in terracing the hillsides and in carrying water from the valleys. Wheat is an ancient crop in the Nile Valley. The grain is important in Algeria and in the eastern Basuto highlands. Fitzgerald (1934, p. 261) remarks on the increase of wheat pro? duction in Kenya since the World War, yet transport to the coast is too costly to make export profitable. Rodd (1926, p. 131) gives a description of agriculture and irrigation at Auderas in Air, southern Sahara, where, in addition to date and dum palms, some wheat, millet, guinea corn, and vegetables are grown with much labor; wheat, however, is a luxury. Bartholomew (1912, p. 52) shows a narrow barley zone along the length of the Mediterranean, in the Nile Valley, and at the extreme southern tip of the continent. There is also a barley-producing district marked on the middle course of the Niger and in the region of Lake Chad. The natural resources of Africa have been briefly discussed by Melland (1932, pp. 111-132) who surveys transport, minerals, timber, grasses, mammals and fishes, soil, rivers, irrigation, water power, cattle, and future possibilities of development. need for ethnobotany So far as anthropological work is concerned research should be connected with the subject of plant ecology. From available data the detailed local distribution of essential food plants could not be</page><page sequence="46">Physiography and Nature Notes 51 plotted, though Schimper (1898, 1903) has written an introductory treatise. Travelers and residents have failed to bring home or to send from Africa varieties of beans, millets, sorghums, manioc, groundnuts, and other flora, in quantities which will allow of plotting detailed topographical distributions, while analysis to determine food values is only in its infancy (E. B. Worthington and other contributors, 1936). This does not mean that work of collation from ethnological researches would have no present value. Some notes on food plants and their domestic preparation and use are given in the majority of ethnological monographs. The Bulletin of Kew Royal Gardens, London, is important (for example, No. 1, 1937). Many valuable articles dealing with plant ecology in south Africa are to be found (SAJS, and Journ. S. Af. Botany). In the pages of M&amp;n oires de la Soci?t? des Sciences Naturelles du Maroc botanical information for north Africa is given, and for this area Chevalier's work (1932) is serviceable. Norton's article (1923) describes plants of Bechuanaland and their uses to Africans. J. M. Dalziel (1916) published a Hausa botanical vocabulary. Shantz and Marbut (1923) have written on vegetation and soils of Africa. The pictorial survey of plant life by Karsten and Schenck (1904) is excellent. Much valuable material is to be found in the Bulletin du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, especially in articles by A. Chevalier. The Im? perial Forestry Institute, Oxford, publishes lists of African flora. Putnam's "Economic Atlas" helps with the study of distribution, and Newland (1922) is a valuable source for information on plants of economic value in west Africa. But, in relation to the size of the continent, the subjects of plant ecology and ethnobotany, with regard to both the latitudinal and the vertical distribution of plants, have not advanced beyond the pio? neering stage. The type of research needed is one which secures the cooperation of ethnologists and ethnobotanists for the preparation of a compendium with topographical maps. Animal Life Study of the fauna of Africa should be carried out in close con? junction with that of climate and plant life. The three taken to? gether, and considered in relation to the ecological regions on Map 2, prepare the way for study of culture areas (section II). With regard to ecological study Bartholomew's "Atlas of Zoogeography" (1911) is of primary importance, since the work permits of a detailed</page><page sequence="47">52 Source Book for African Anthropology comparison between distribution of animals and such human occu? pations as hunting, fishing, herding cattle, and breeding camels. Without attempting a complete survey, a summary of the princi? pal forms of animal life will be made with a view to showing the importance of these in native economy, occupation, religion, and folklore. Beginning with Mammalia, to which most of the large domesticated animals belong, we pass to Aves, Pisces, Amphibia, Reptilia, and Orthoptera. For purposes of scientific reference the Cambridge Natural History (Harmer and Shipley, Editors, 1895) will be of great general service. For popular reading and excellent photographs, G. T. Hutchinson (1922-24) will be found serviceable. Another work of general botanical and zoological importance is edited by Schouteden (1928), and issued periodically. P. A. Buxton (1925) has produced an informative regional study, "Animal Life in Deserts," and for biological study of the Sahara, of a non-technical kind, Buchanan (1926) will be found useful. I would advise, also, the reading of Carpenter (1925), who gives a regional survey of the natural history of east Africa. An excellent regional survey of the fauna of Liberia and parts of the Belgian Congo is given in a report of the Harvard Expedition (1926-27), for which Strong (1930) is the editor of numerous articles contributed by specialists. Sudan Notes and Records contains many contributions of zoological interest, and the Journal of the Uganda and East Africa Natural History Society is valuable for both ethnology and biology. For giving a biological background which will lead to an intelli? gent understanding of African beliefs and customs and the association of these with animal life, the following works are of value: Selous (1895), one of the greatest of African hunters, Bland-Sutton (1911), Statham (1922), Roosevelt and Heller (1915), Akeley (1923), and de Ramecourt (1936). mammals Among the fauna of Africa no animal has been of greater importance than the elephant. Ivory has been a source of wealth for native chiefs, who buried the tusks in their compounds and regarded the cache as a reserve which at any time could be converted into other forms of wealth. Ivory has also played an important role in African art and religion. European demand for ivory gave an impetus to exploration, the slave trade, and the desire to acquire African territory. Masudi, an Arab geographer (a.d. 983), states</page><page sequence="48"></page><page sequence="49">54 Source Book for African Anthropology that Arabic ships brought ivory from Africa to Arabia, whence it was transported to India and China (Laufer, 1925). The African elephant, which differs from the Indian genus in formation of the skull, shape of the teeth, and size of the ears, has a distribution from 10? north of the equator to 20? south of that line. The belief prevails that the African elephant, unlike his Indian relative, is untamable. This is untrue, for at Api in the northeast Belgian Congo domestication has been achieved. A wild herd is stampeded so that the calves may be roped. These are kindly treated, fed by hand, washed, and fanned with leaves. In six weeks the captives are so tame that they are allowed to accompany the domestic herd to pasture. Finally, the elephants are harnessed to carts and made to draw heavy loads of timber. But this kind of transport does not justify the time and expense required for the capture and training. The Roman historian, Livy, gives an account of the use of elephants by the Carthaginian leader, Hannibal, about the year 217 b.c., and there is no doubt that the Carthaginians tamed the African elephant. Blunt (1933) has collated useful information pertaining to African elephants, their distribution, and the past and future of the ivory trade. Other authorities on the African elephant are Marius Max? well (1924) and Marcuswell Maxwell (1930). The history of the camel in Africa has been a debatable subject. Bones of camels found in the Pleistocene strata show that these animals were part of the ancient fauna of Africa at the time of early stone-age man, but proofs of the use of camels even in the early historical periods of Egypt are lacking. The camel was known in Egypt possibly as early as 3500 b.c., for an earthen figure of this animal has been found in a predynastic grave at Abydos. But the camel does not play any part in Egyptian mythology; neither have Egyptians left drawings of camels, though Egyptian murals give numerous representations of cattle, horses, and donkeys (Erman, 1894, p. 493; Caton-Thompson, 1934, No. 24; Flamand, 1906). Gautier (Mayhew's translation, p. 124) states that the camel was first imported into Egypt during the Persian conquest of 525 b.c., but for several centuries the camel did not make its way westward. Archaeological evidence occurs in the form of Saharan petroglyphs, whose grouping, according to Monod (1932), shows pre-cameline and cameline cultures of the Sahara in the central region of Adrar Ahnet. Rodd (1936, pp. 206-208) describes the nomadic and sedentary life of the Tuareg of the present day, and shows how both modes of</page><page sequence="50">Physiography and Nature Notes 55 life are dependent on the rearing of camels. He reviews the historical testimony of Roman writers who described north Africa, and he arrives at the conclusion that the camel was not used for transport in Africa until the Arabian camel was so employed about the second century of the Christian era (see also A. E. Robinson, 1936). The camel is used as a draft animal and a beast of burden in some of the dry regions of southwest Africa, but introduction of the animal into that area is an instance of modern European enterprise, and as such is unimportant compared with the typical camel cultures of the Sahara. The use of horses in Africa (Figs. 70, 75) is of importance, since the breeding of horses, the manufacture of their accouterments, and employment of them in warfare, have affected Negro culture through Arab influence. Horses were known in Egypt in Dynasty XII, about the year 2466 b.c., but the animals were not bred there until several centuries later; by that time the Egyptians had learned the use of horse-drawn chariots in warfare. In Dynasty XXII horses were plentiful in Egypt, and in I Kings 2: 28, there is the statement that King Solomon had horses brought from Egypt; this would be about the year 966 b.c. In Egyptian warfare horses were harnessed in pairs for drawing chariots, but there is no evidence that they were used for riding (Erman, 1894, pp. 490-493). Hannibal used horses for his cavalry, and he took Numidian horsemen from north Africa to Italy for his campaign against the Romans. These historical facts show that horses were part of a north African culture more than four thousand years ago, and from that time onward there has been dis? persal with introduction of new breeds intermittently. Horses are used chiefly in the region of north Africa between the desert and the forest; namely, the semi-desert and parkland country which extends across the continent. Although dryness is a general characteristic of this region, and droughts may be prolonged, wells are sufficiently numerous to enable horses to make the journey. An African warrior named Rabeh (Von Oppenheim, 1902) crossed this territory with thousands of horsemen about the year 1895. He harried the country around Lake Chad, until he was defeated and killed by the French in the year 1900. A remarkable journey made by horses was that of Mansur's troops, who marched from Morocco across the western Sahara about four centuries ago. His objective was the Songhai empire in the northern bend of the River Niger, and his success was due to the feeling of security of his enemies, who never anticipated a column</page><page sequence="51">56 Source Book for African Anthropology from the direction of the desert. Thousands of camels were used for transport of water supplies, and the attacking force was divided so that not too great a demand was made on the wells of one route (Bovill, 1926). Up to the year a.d. 1900 horses were commonly used in the campaigns of northern Nigeria, where each of the rulers had a large body of troops. British conquest ended this internal strife in the year 1903, when the Fulani and Hausa were subdued, but there yet remain troops of horse which are ceremonially used by native chiefs. Fig. 75, b shows a horseman of the bodyguard of the Emir of Fika. The rider is clad in a coat of mail and a metal helmet. Fig. 75, a illustrates the equine accouterments used in Abyssinia. Horses quickly contract disease from the bite of the tsetse fly; therefore, their distribution is limited by the occurrence of this pest. Horses are bred near Sokoto in northwest Nigeria, and in Bornu in the northeast of the country. In every marketplace blacksmiths and leather workers produce iron bits, hobbles, stirrups, saddles, bridles, and ornamental saddle-covers. The most handsome cattle are the long-horned animals of Bornu in Nigeria (Fig. 89) and Damaraland in southwest Africa, and later it will be possible to show that many tribes of east Africa are so organized that every aspect of their lives is closely related to their herds. These are tribes of a true cattle culture (section II, chap. III). Other divisions of cattle breeders have to be considered; namely, nomad tribes of Kordofan, and the Fulani of west Africa, whose cattle are used for transport. In addition to these functipns of cattle, there are important instances of the use of riding oxen by Europeans. Lindblom (1931) has mapped the distribution of this practice. Dutch farmers of south Africa use ox-carts, and this kind of transport may also be seen in Angola. In Angola and elsewhere a European may be seen riding an ox which is guided by reins attached to a brass rod passed through the septum of the animal's nose. A saddle is provided, and to this are attached broad, brass stirrups (Fig. 68, b). The rate of travel is about three miles an hour, the same pace as that of a baggage camel. In Egypt and north Africa oxen are used for turning wheels which pump water for irrigation. The historical arguments relating to breeds of cattle in Egypt have been summarized by Erman (1894, p. 443). He points out that in addition to the old long-horned race there appears to have been an introduction of the short-horned humped variety about the period of the New Empire. Recent discussions of the historical aspects of</page><page sequence="52">Fig. 13. Domestic animals, a. Fat-tailed sheep. 6. Long-eared Syrian goat* c. Fat-rumped sheep, d. Keltic breed of long-snouted pig. 57</page><page sequence="53">58 Source Book for African Anthropology domestication of animals in Africa have been offered by Kroll (1928, pp. 177-290), and Hilzheimer (1930, pp. 472-483). Crossing of principal breeds has occurred, and Meek (1925, vol. 1, p. 118) dis? tinguishes five main types of cattle in Nigeria. H. H. Curson (1935, 1936) has described some parent breeds of African cattle. Donkeys, overloaded and distressed with sores, are used in Egypt, where the ass was a beast of burden more than five thousand years ago. From the north coast of Africa to within a few degrees of the equator donkeys are used for transport. In some parts of the eastern Sudan and Abyssinia are wild asses that introduce new blood into the diminutive stock owned by natives. The female asses are left at night in places where they are visited by wild asses. The donkey, like the ox, is used for purposes other than transport. In the Atlas region of Algeria and Morocco may sometimes be seen a primitive plow to which are harnessed a woman and a donkey, for among the Kabyles women perform all the heavy agricultural work. Pigs are widely kept except by Mohammedan tribes. A slim, long-snouted pig is described by Europeans as a Keltic breed, and, in addition to this, strains of every European variety of pig may be seen. Sheep of Syrian origin, and also goats, are widely dispersed. Hutchinson (1922-24, vol. 1, pp. 469-470) pictures breeds of sheep domesticated in Africa. The Egyptians had a domestic sheep at a remote period, while other breeds have been introduced by way of the Sinai peninsula at unknown periods (Fig. 13). Although the history of domestic animals is difficult to unravel, several truths can be accepted. The African buffalo has never been domesticated; therefore the breeds of cattle now found in Africa are not the descendants of African buffaloes. Domesticated pigs are not descended from wild pigs of African forests, since these animals have not been domesticated in any part of the continent. Domestic dogs which are present in all villages are not bred from wild dogs. These hunt in packs and in appearance they bear some resemblance to hyenas. Cats were domesticated, worshipped, and mummified locally in ancient Egypt, but they are not commonly found in African villages today. Instances of the domestication of feral cats by African natives, and the distribution of domesticated cats among Bantu Negroes are subjects discussed by H. Kroll (1928, p. 183). Hahn (1896) published an early standard work on the domestication of animals, containing many references to African animals. Chief among wild animals which are of importance to African hunters are antelopes of many species. These abound in the park</page><page sequence="54">Physiography and Nature Notes 59 land region which surrounds the central forest zone. In the grass? land, too, and even in semi-desert the grass is high enough to shelter herds of antelope, while gazelle may be seen in true desert country where expanses of waterless desert are broken by rocky hills. In Africa the only deer (Cervidae) are Cervus elaphus barbarus and Cervus dama, in the extreme north. The antelope (Bovidae) should not be described as deer since anatomical differences exist. Deer shed their horns, but this is not characteristic of antelopes. The largest African antelopes are the eland (Fig. 12, extreme left) and the roan, while the smallest is the dik-dik, only twelve inches high at the shoulders, with a body no larger than that of a rabbit. The giraffe (Laufer, 1928), rhinoceros, hippopotamus, zebra, and okapi have all been important in hunting communities, and with the exception of the okapi and the hippopotamus, all find their natural habitat in the open country on the fringe of denser forests, especially in Kenya and Tanganyika Territory. The white rhinoceros, which has really little claim to the name "white," occurs with very local distribution in the Upper Nile region and in south Africa. The pygmy hippopotamus is found only in Liberia. The gradual spread of civilization, together with the depreda? tions of hunters, both European and African, has restricted the range of many animals (Hobley, 1929-30). In a later chapter dealing with archaeology it will be possible to show that rock engravings of giraffe, ostriches, and other animals indicate their former presence in regions where they have not been seen within the memory of living people. In addition to rock engravings and pictographs in colors, the evidence of past distribution is based on osteological discoveries, and the observation of Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. From the ethno? logical point of view the migration of animals is important, for when such movements occur, possibly as a result of changing climate, the activities and migrations of human beings are also affected. The okapi, a name given by the Bambuti Pygmies of the Ituri Forest in the northeast Belgian Congo, has special claims to interest. Pygmy hunters showed the skin of an okapi to the German explorer W. Junker, in 1878, though Junker did not see a living okapi, and the animal was at that time unknown to zoologists. The okapi, an entire skin of which was sent to England in 1901 by Sir H. H. John? ston, is a member of the giraffe family. Affinity with giraffes is shown by the structure of the skull and teeth. Some Pygmy tribes hunt this animal, whose skin is valued for making belts which are worn by men only.</page><page sequence="55">60 Source Book for African Anthropology The hyrax (Fig. 14), also known as the coney and rock rabbit, appears to belong to the order of rodents, but the outward form is deceptive. Examination proves that the hyrax belongs to the order of ungulates or hoofed animals which we have been considering. The creature is so exceptional as to require a zoological division of its own, namely, the Hyracoidea. Zulu tribes of southeast Africa are exceptionally skilled in sewing together skins of hyrax to make ^^K&amp;j^^^^^^^^^^ ' ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Fig. 14. Hyrax, Abyssinia. Scale about 1:20 (from group in Field Museum). long fur cloaks called karosses. Leakey (1936b, pp. 36-39) gives informative notes on the habits of this animal. Chief among the carnivorous animals are lions, leopards, hyenas (Fig. 16, a, 6), wild dogs, foxes, and jackals. Bears have been seen rarely and only in the extreme northwest, where the fauna approxi? mates that of Europe. Most of the carnivorous animals play a part in native stories, hunting, and beliefs of a sacred kind. Lions and leopards are sometimes the sacred emblems of chiefs, and in describ? ing Negro religion, beliefs in the reincarnation of human souls in these animals will be described. Some medicine-men assert that they are able to send their souls into leopards or hyenas, so tempora? rily controlling the creatures. Or the belief may be maintained that</page><page sequence="56">Physiography and Nature Notes 61 a man can turn himself into an animal, or that he may by magical means inflict this metamorphosis on an enemy. A leopard has been the symbolic animal of the most important secret society of west Africa. Members of the society dressed themselves in leopard skins and armed themselves with claws. So equipped they slew a victim and ceremonial cannibalism followed. The ingenuity of Bushman and Pygmy hunters, and the ritual that accompanies hunting among Negroes make the study of animal Fig. 15. African cheetahs. Scale about 1:36 (from group in Field Museum). life of deep interest. The fauna of Africa has affected art and handi? crafts by providing motifs for wood-carvers, metal workers, and rock sculptors. When considering ideas of a totemic kind the importance of animal emblems will be observed. These zoomorphic symbols have a religious and a social significance; therefore, a mysti? cal relationship exists between a totem animal and the members of the clan, or between a person and his individual totem (chap. III). In some parts of Somaliland and Abyssinia cheetahs (Fig. 15), which are similar to leopards in appearance, are used for hunting, just as they are in parts of northern India and Persia. A hooded cheetah is taken to the chase, and when in sight of a gazelle the hood</page><page sequence="57">62 Source Book for African Anthropology is removed. This form of hunting is not common in Africa and the region of occurrence suggests diffusion from Asia. The civet, which is closely related to the mongoose (Fig. 17), has a restricted commercial use. It is sometimes kept in captivity and made to discharge from its caudal glands a musk-flavored substance used in manufacturing a perfume (Meek, 1925, vol. 1, p. 149). Among carnivorous animals should be mentioned the striped, the spotted, and the brown hyenas, which are typically nocturnal scavengers that feed on the kill of other carnivores. But hyenas at times enter camp and steal living animals. The jaws and shoulders are extremely powerful, yet the hind quarters slope with a suggestion of weakness in comparison with the fore quarters (Fig. 16). Gnawing animals (rodents) are numerous in Africa. The order includes large forest rats, small rats and mice of many species, ground squirrels and tree squirrels, the jerboa (in desert regions), the porcu? pine, and the hare. The last-named is a great favorite in Negro folklore because of his cunning, which is directed toward deceiving the larger and stronger animals. The jerboa is common in Egypt and the Sahara, where it is easily recognized by its method of hopping on its long hind legs in kangaroo fashion. Porcupines are widely distributed south of the Sahara; the Ovimbundu use the quills of these creatures for making a special head ornament for medicine-men. Among the insectivores, moles and shrews are of common occur? rence; the former range over almost the whole of Africa south of the equator. The bats (Cheiroptera) are distributed over the whole of Africa, and there are also flying foxes with a more limited dis? tribution just north and south of the equator. The true vampire, which is a blood-sucking bat, is limited to South America. Allen, Lang, and Chapin (1917) have written a monograph on African bats with a section on native beliefs and customs connected with these creatures (pp. 493-494). Creatures belonging to the Edentata or toothless animals are the aardvark and the pangolin (Fig. 18, a, 6). The former, whose name is a Dutch word meaning earth pig, is found in no part of the world except Africa, where it is fairly common in the east, south, and southwest. The body of the aardvark is about five feet in length, the ears are long, and the hide is scantily covered with hair. With strong claws the aardvark digs in the sides of termite hills, and licks up the ants with a whiplike tongue that shoots out from a tubular</page><page sequence="58">b Fig. 16. African hyenas, a.

Recent research indicates that resemblances of the aardvark to the anteaters and pangolins are superficial. The aardvark is now separately classified as Tubulidentata. The pangolin, Smutsia temminckii, which is sometimes called the scaly anteater or manis, is somewhat similar in appearance to the armadillo of South America. The points of comparison are the long tapering snout, the armored covering, and the strong claws used for digging in termite hills. The scaly covering of the pangolin is, however, distinctly different in structure from that of the arma? dillo. The pangolin has a wide geographical range in Africa, from 10? N. Lat. almost to the southern extremity of the continent. amphibians and reptiles Frogs and toads are numerous among the amphibians. The most important reptiles are crocodiles and pythons. The African crocodile is regarded by some tribes as a sacred reptile, and today at Ibadan in southern Nigeria a sacred white crocodile is kept in the custody of a priest (Fig. 83, b). In former days food offerings, including human sacrifices, were made to white crocodiles. The whiteness is genuine albinism which occurs in reptiles, though some? what rarely. Useful works of reference are Ditmars' "Reptiles of the World" (1910), and reprint (1936). Pythons have a general distribution everywhere in Africa south of the Sahara, and although they thrive in a moist habitat and swim freely, they are equally adaptable to open and fairly dry country. There are several species, of which Python sebae, the largest (Fig. 83, a) may attain a length of twenty-five feet. The vertebrae are supposed by several tribes to be a cure for rheumatism. A village chief in Angola presented me with a necklace of these bones, which he declared to be a certain cure. The fat of the python is thought by some tribes to have curative properties, and sometimes the gall bladder is used for magical practices. The section dealing with African religions shows how important the python has been in a system of python worship which was carried on in Uganda, and in west Africa at several centers (Hambly, 1929a, 1931a). The con? strictor snakes of Africa must, by zoological classification, be called pythons. Those constrictor snakes designated as boas have their habitat chiefly in South America, and there is a species in Madagascar. The spitting cobra is not a figment of the traveler's imagination. These spitting snakes are widely distributed in Africa, and they do,</page><page sequence="60">Fig. 17. Mongoose, southwest Africa.

Many authentic records attest the effect of the poison, which causes severe ocular inflammation. African tales of fire spitting serpents may be founded on this fact. There is also good zoological ground for folklore stories of double-headed snakes. Some snakes taper at both ends, and in addition to this peculiarity they have a habit of raising the hinder part when approached; therefore, casual observation suggests the presence of two heads. Serviceable works of reference are Ditmars (1932), K. P. Schmidt (1923), and Loveridge (1936). The last-named gives a list of African reptiles and amphibians in the collections of Field Museum of Natural History. Tortoises are numerous in Africa, and there is no creature so well described in folklore tales. The tortoise is generally represented Fig. 19. Catfish, Ciarias senegalensis. Scale about 1:3. as using great cunning to outwit the larger and faster animals. In the market of Ibadan, Nigeria, large tortoises are sold as food, and snakes are eaten by many Negro tribes. FISHES In African rivers and lakes live many species of edible fish whose capture by nets, weirs, spearing, poisoning, drag-baskets, and lines provides an extensive study relating to the economics of food supply. Beliefs in the sacredness of catfish survive in Liberia and Nigeria. At If? in the latter territory I was taken to a pool of sacred catfish (Fig. 19). At first no movement could be seen; then, as my guide agitated the water and threw in a little meal, the pond became alive with catfish, some of considerable size. Because of its sacred character the catfish was often a design on bronze plaques made in ancient Benin, where religion and art were closely connected. Boulenger (1909-16) has a standard work on the fishes of Africa.</page><page sequence="63">68 Source Book for African Anthropology birds Birds are too plentiful and widely distributed to discuss in detail. To the Egyptians the ibis was a sacred bird which was mummified and buried; there was also the sacred hawk of Horus, and at present many religious beliefs center in bird life. I found among the Ovim bundu that three birds were reverenced. Esuvi is a bird with power to catch spirits of the dead, so making them die a second death. It flies by night. Other sacred birds of the Ovimbundu are one onduva, the plantain-eater, Turacus livingstonii, whose feathers are used by kings and medicine-men, and another onjimbi, an owl, Bubo maculosus, whose cry is a premonition of death. The bird life of Africa includes vultures, which are protected by law because they are efficient scavengers. In some villages they may be seen associating themselves with poultry and remaining near human habitations. Among common birds are hornbills of great size, kingfishers, parrots, nightjars, egrets, hawks, eagles, flamingoes, and weaver-birds (Fig. 20). The secretary bird, some? what larger than a stork, plays a useful part in devouring snakes. Of all birds, perhaps the ostrich has been the most important in the economics of African hunters, and the bird has been domesti? cated in south Africa, where ostrich farming for the sake of the plumes is a notable industry. Laufer (1926) has discussed the importance of the ostrich in ancient and modern times. Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert use the eggshells as receptacles for water (Fig. 63) either in transport or for storing in a cache. Eggs and ostriches are a valuable source of food supply, while the shells are made into disk-shaped beads that are highly valued as personal ornaments and trade objects by Bushman tribes. In ancient times engraving ostrich eggshells was a form of art in Egypt and north Africa, and this practice the Bushmen still follow, though the engravings are of an elementary geometrical kind. In many Negro tribes collecting eggs is part of the routine work of women and children, and feathers for decorative head? dresses are valued by some tribes, for example, the Suk and the Masai (Fig. 39), who use ostrich feathers. But feathers of small birds are sometimes equally important for decoration and as sacred emblems. The pink tail feathers of the African parrot, Psittacus erithacus, are sold in Nigerian markets. Poultry is important over the whole continent, though the breeds, except where crossed with European importations, are diminutive. The future offers great opportunity for improving the weight of the</page><page sequence="64">Physiography and Nature Notes 69 birds and increasing their egg production. Domestication of the Guinea fowl has formed the subject of a brief article by D. Newbold (1926). European ducks may be seen in many parts of west Africa. For reference a student has several standard works. Reichenow (1900-1901) has produced several volumes on the birds of Africa, Fig. 20. African weaver-birds and nest. Scale about 1:6 (from specimens in Field Museum). and one of the volumes is an atlas of distributions. Stark (1900) has described the birds of south Africa, and Ramsay (1923) has provided a "Guide to the Birds of Europe and North Africa." Bannerman's volumes (1930) describe birds of tropical west Africa. Other authorities are Meinertzhagen (1930) for Egypt; Belcher (1930) for Nyasaland; Priest (1933) for Southern Rhodesia; and Chapin (1932) for the Belgian Congo.</page><page sequence="65">70 Source Book for African Anthropology locusts, flies, etc. The locust is the most destructive of the Orthoptera, to which order crickets, grasshoppers, and the praying mantis belong. The mantis is important in the folklore and religious beliefs of Bushmen and Hottentots. At present there is no effective means of suppressing the swarms of locusts which appear periodically in almost all parts of Africa. Digging ditches to trap the creatures during the crawling stage of their existence, inoculation with disease, and the use of sodium arsenite fumes (Illustrated London News, 1934, p. 561) have all been tried as remedies, but with only a measure of success. H. B. Johnstone (1924, pp. 91-101) has described the structure and habits of the family Acridiidae, to which most of the destructive locusts belong. He mentions various species and their phylogenetic relationships. From the egg stage the "hoppers" pass through several skin-castings before attaining the mature winged condition. The occurrence of solitary and swarming phases for many species of locusts has now been definitely established. Locusts are an article of diet in regions as far apart as Morocco, Angola, and the Kalahari Desert. They are roasted and eaten at once, or preserved in fat and salt. The small animal life of Africa is most important of all, because these are pestiferous forms that determine the welfare of human beings and animals. The most detested of these pests used to be the mosquito Stegomyia fasciata (formerly Aedes aegypti), because it is the carrier of yellow fever, which still breaks out periodically along the coast from Sierra Leone to Cameroons. The female Anopheles mosquito carries the germs of malaria fever, which may attack mildly or fatally. Africans are by no means immune from malaria, and repeated attacks are serious because of the lowered resistance they induce. Almost as deadly are the tsetse flies, Glossinia palpalis and Glossinia morsitans, which are carriers of trypanosomes of sleeping sickness. These pests have an important influence on the distribu? tion of human settlements and the keeping of cattle. The jigger, a word derived from the West Indian chigoe, is a flea, which was introduced into Africa from South America. It bores under the toe nails, where the egg sac sets up a severe inflammation. Failure to remove the sacs leads to pedal deformity and loss of toes. There are many species of parasitic worms that breed in water and spend part of their life cycle in the bodies of human beings or animals. Some of these worms affect the lymph system, so causing elephantia? sis, while other forms attack the bladder and intestines.</page><page sequence="66">Physiography and Nature Notes 71 Imm's "General Textbook of Entomology" (1924) is perhaps the most useful compendium for reference. For understanding the nature of tropical diseases and their menace to native and European welfare, Strong (1930) should be consulted. The volumes edited by R. P. Strong are reports of the Harvard expedition to Liberia and the Belgian Congo (1926-27), and perusal of the notes on malarial and yellow fevers, filariasis, yaws, syphilis, leprosy, and sleeping sickness will prepare the way for understanding of problems of native welfare and European survival (section IV). Simpson (1912, p. 353) brings out clearly the way in which trypanosomiasis in horses and cattle affects human endeavor and the distribution of cultures. Near Lokoja 60 per cent of the horses brought into the town develop this disease within a year, and of these 50 per cent die of the disease within the same period. In conclusion of a brief study of animals in relation to man, one more instance, and this an example from entomology, may be quoted. Dicke (1932, pp. 792-796) has discussed the influence of the tsetse fly on the history of south Africa. He advances the hypothesis that the central movement of Bantu migration into south Africa was checked by the tsetse-fly belt which stretched across the northern Transvaal, and the territories north of it. In addition to the probable effect of tsetse-fly belts in native migration and cattle-keeping, the fly has influenced the course of European history by determining the direction of roads and railways. In 1847 the Boers defeated Umsili katsi in Southern Rhodesia, and in 1851 they were victorious over Sechele in Bechuanaland, yet they took no advantage of the situation, because the tsetse fly prevented immediate occupation of territory. But, by the time the fly-infested areas had diminished and passages had opened through these Boer territories, British influence had secured a footing in Bechuanaland and Southern Rhodesia, so check? ing Dutch expansion.</page><page sequence="67">IL HISTORY Kinds of Evidence The data available for study of African history and prehistory fall into two main divisions: (1) Direct evidence afforded by datable writings; (2) indirect evidence, or inferential testimony. Direct evidence is available for Egypt from 4000 b.c. onward through the early dynasties, the Middle Empire and the New Empire, through Persian, Greek, Roman, and Arab occupations. Datable evidence can be given for the activities of Carthaginians from about 900 b.c. and a chronology of Arab incursions from a.d. 700 onward is fairly reliable. This is written documentary evidence, the oldest form of which is Egyptian papyri of hieroglyphs, thence through the demotic and hieratic forms to Coptic. Latin and Greek histories, Punic inscriptions, and a large body of Arabic texts form the remainder of the direct evidence up to the fifteenth century, at which time European exploration began with voyages of the Portuguese. These documents taken collectively furnish a foundation of fact, but the period they cover is short in relation to the prehistory of man in Africa, and inquiry is soon forced backward into an undocumented period of indirect evidence that accumulated before 4000 b.c. Indirect evidence includes the following studies: Valuable among the data available for prehistoric research are those of archaeology. Working in conjunction with geologists, archaeologists study stone implements, rock carvings, paintings in caves and on exposed rocks, stone monuments, and the remains of human habitations. The physique of African races has been studied to a limited extent by anthropometric methods. Human skeletal material, especially that which is deeply buried, undisturbed, and ancient, has been examined for evidence concerning early types of man. This paleon tological evidence is so far very meager. African languages are now demanding a thorough scientific study with special reference to their structure and interrelationship, and the fact is encouraging that, despite the absence of written languages for the bulk of the population, traditions of historical events have been orally transmitted from one generation to another. Old people are often valuable informants, while mythology and folklore preserve records of historical events and exalted individuals who appear as culture heroes. At the courts of Negro kings are to be found officials 72</page><page sequence="68">History 73 whose principal duty is to memorize tribal history and genealogical tables. The outline of African languages demands a separate chapter, while the distribution of different modes of life and the study of somatic traits also need individual consideration. Therefore, the present chapter is restricted to a review of the facts of datable history, and of prehistory examined in the light of archaeological investigation. Splitting a problem into component parts does not mean that the sections are not logically connected. On the contrary, the data that are classified under different headings are actually unified; the subjects merely represent different angles from which historical problems can be reviewed, and the synthesis will be made later when sufficient data have been accumulated. In this chapter examination of historical and prehistorical evidence proceeds from datable events to the less clearly interpreted facts of archaeology. Datable Events egypt and asia There is no part of the world whose ancient history has been more thoroughly studied than that of the Nile Valley. The results of concentration on archaeological and historical research in Egypt during a century at least are particularly helpful, since Egypt is connected with Asia, which was the original home of some present day African people, languages, and customs. The history of Egypt from the earliest times to 500 b.c. has been compressed into one volume with a detailed scheme of chronology (Breasted, 1910; in German by Erman, 1923). The workmanship of stone implements from Egypt attests the fact that some predynastic Egyptians had mastered the difficult art of flint knapping. In Neolithic times these skilled lapidaries made slender flint armbands, while the finely serrated edges of sickles, and ripple-flaking that is done by pressure, were well executed. Flint arrowheads were of the best workmanship. Moreover, there were implements of copper in some of the predynastic graves, and bronze, which is an alloy of copper and tin, was known in Egypt at an early date, but iron work was rather late in making an appearance. Flinders Petrie's work "Arts and Crafts of Ancient Egypt" shows the high standard of workmanship attained in weaving with the verti? cal cotton loom, leatherwork, making beads of stone and glass,</page><page sequence="69">74 Source Book for African Anthropology ivory-turning, wood-carving, basketry, pottery, and jewelry of gold and silver. In addition to the evidence of skilled handwork, many examples of which have been recovered from royal tombs such as that of Tut Ankh-Amen, the Egyptians are known to have had a complex religion and philosophy. Sacred writings, notably the "Book of the Dead," explain the Egyptian outlook on life, death, and the journey of the spirit to the judgment halls of Osiris. There the heart was weighed in the balance, and the deceased had to recite the negative confession before forty-two judges, denying the sins of adultery and false witness, and in substance abjuring all the human weaknesses which are proscribed by the Ten Commandments; these are possibly a derivative from the Egyptian code (Petrie, 1923). The journey to the land of shades was not an easy one, a fact which is attested, not only by sacred writings and pictures describing the combats of the spirit with serpents and other monsters, but also by the wrapping of amulets in the swathings of the mummy. In order to avoid damage to mummies the contents of the wrappings are now studied at Field Museum by means of X-ray photographs which indicate the nature and position of amulets and the technique of the embalming process. The photographs also indicate the presence of fractures and methods of reducing them, while diseases of bone are in some instances clearly shown (Moodie, 1931). The spread of the practice of mummification from Egypt has been discussed by the late G. Elliot Smith (1929) but his belief in a world-wide diffusion from Egypt has been freely criticized and is not generally accepted. Egyptian mythology was particularly rich in explanatory stories. Thus Toth is described and pictured as a scribe who stands by the god Khnemu. The latter is molding men on his potter's wheel, while the former marks off the span of each life by cutting notches on a palm stem. In this way human origins and destinies were accounted for by etiological stories. The communal life of the Egyptians was complex, for in addition to a hierarchy of priests, who were the custodians of documents that they themselves compiled, there were sacred kings, tax-gatherers, military organizations, eorv?es of labor for public works, and a commercial system that sent caravans south to the Sudan and east to the Red Sea. National life was focused in the king, whose strength and longevity depended on spiritual power, which was ceremonially renewed in a temple by laying the royal hands on an image of Ra, the Sun god.</page><page sequence="70">History 75 Art and sculpture were closely associated with religious belief, mythology, and handwriting, which progressed from a system of hieroglyphs to a cursive hand. The importance of handwriting can? not be overestimated, since the social and religious structure, together with the material progress, is described in documents that cover a period from about 3500 b.c. up to the Greek and Roman occupations, and beyond them to the period of Arab conquest of Egypt in the seventh century of the Christian era. That some diffusion of beliefs and customs from Egypt has taken place is certain, but no comprehensive study has yet shown the effects of culture contacts of the Nile Valley on social systems of Africa. Several anthropologists have, however, called attention to some arresting similarities between certain traits of Egyptian and Negro culture (Delafosse, 1900; Meek, 1931a, passim; Talbot, 1926, passim; C. G. and B. Z. Seligman, 1932, p. 34; H. R. Palmer, 1936b). G. E. Smith (1929) and Perry (1926) present the broadest possible views of the world-wide spread of Egyptian or Heliolithic culture. The number of traits that spread from the Nile Valley, the distance they traveled, and the degree of modification they experienced are uncertain. But the following may be instances of the spread of cultural traits from Egypt to other parts of Africa. The Egyptian idea of the king as a sacred being, on whose vigor national welfare depended, led to the custom of killing decrepit kings, so that the prosperity of the country might not be impaired. Up to recent times this custom of killing the king prevailed in Uganda, among the Shilluk of the Upper Nile, and in west Africa among the Yoruba (C. G. Seligman, 1933). The Bahima, a Hamitic tribe of Uganda, practiced the Egyptian custom of brother and sister marriages within the royal family so that the dynasty might be preserved. The fact that Hamites penetrated the Nile Valley, advanced down the eastern side of Africa, and exerted an influence on Negro west Africa, should not be forgotten when attempting to explain the distribution of these apparently Egyptian customs, which might perhaps be more correctly described as Hamitic rather than specifi? cally Egyptian (C. G. Seligman, 1913, pp. 593-704). The Egyptians believed in a spiritual double, which after death visited the tomb where offerings and material comforts were pro? vided, and to this ethereal counterpart of the body the name ka was given. In Ashanti a similar belief exists, for the kra escapes from the body of a dying person, whose gasps are said to be due to the exertion</page><page sequence="71">76 Source Book for African Anthropology of the kra in an uphill journey to the spirit world (Rattray, 1927a, pp. 153, 318). Use of a funeral boat by the Jukun of Nigeria and the digging of shafted burial chambers resemble Egyptian practices. The hierarchy of gods, the elaborate priesthoods, and the worship of sacred animals among the Yoruba and the Ashanti may perhaps, be added to traits that may have been derived from the Nile Valley. Personal observa? tion and reference to the writings quoted suggest that Ashanti, Dahomey, and part of Nigeria have similar cultural traits relating to kingship, theology, and art, and that these coordinated traits show resemblance to the Egyptian system, though there is always the possibility of independent development. Much more detailed com? parison is necessary to make a demonstration. Egypt has acted as a cultural gateway to Africa from Asia, and in the Nile Valley many Asiatic traits have been absorbed, utilized, perhaps changed in form, and then passed on. Reference has been made to the cultivated plants and domestic animals which may have entered Africa by way of Egypt, and to the observations already made should be added data from an article by H. H. Johnston (1913, pp. 375-417). This writer believes that humped cattle came from India, and that the short plump goat is a native of Syria, while the same country is mentioned as the probable home of the Roman nosed goat with long hair and pendent ears. Domestic fowls were probably introduced from India, Syria, and Persia. Some breeds of horses, Arabian camels, long-horned cattle, and fat-tailed sheep are probably Asiatic in origin, and there is a possibility that rice and wheat first came from Mesopotamia. As the story of African contacts with Asia is unfolded, and the function of early Semites, and later Arabs, as culture carriers is made clear, there is a natural tendency to examine African cultures with the purpose of isolating the borrowed elements. Da Barros (1777-78) is a standard work of consultation for the history of Arabs in east Africa. Hirschberg (1931, pp. 272-275) has discussed Arabian, Persian, and Indian influences in east Africa, and Stuhlmann (1910) called attention to east African methods of working in iron and brass that show Arab and Persian influence. Hirschberg demon? strates similarity between systems of time reckoning near Lake Victoria and those used in early Arabian and Persian times. Schoff (1912) has written a valuable commentary on an ancient document, "The Periplus of the Erythrean Sea" (circa a.d. 60), giving an account of Arab voyages on the coast of India and lower east Africa.</page><page sequence="72">History 77 The Midgan hunters of Somaliland use a bow resembling the sigmoid Asiatic form, and in Abyssinia there are in use round shields whose prototypes are Asiatic. Two musical instruments, not of African origin, are widely used in north and west Africa. One of these is a pottery drum having a piece of hide as a tympanum, and the other instrument, which has a variety of forms, is a kind of fiddle provided with horsehair strings. A small bow strung with the same kind of material is used for playing the instrument. L. Frobe nius (1922) has described and plotted the distribution of these and other alleged Asiatic traits, which he has discussed more fully in "Kultur-Geschichte Afrikas" (1933). Contacts between Egypt and Persia have been frequent and prolonged, and in view of the early manufacture of chain armor (Fig. 75, b) in the latter country, there is almost a certainty that this form of protection for man and horse entered Africa by way of Egypt. In addition to a Persian origin of chain mail (Laufer, 1914) there may be truth in the statement that the Crusaders on their way to and from Palestine, from the eleventh to the fourteenth century, introduced some of the chain mail. Making silver wire, beating out vessels of brass, also casting in bronze, are not usual and indigenous handicrafts of Negroes, and all the evidence suggests migration of these traits over north Africa, and into the western part of the continent. In Ashanti cloth is orna? mented with designs stamped on the material by wooden blocks, which is a well-known Persian method. The shaduf, a lever for raising water from wells, is used in northern Nigeria and this is known to be a device used in ancient Egypt. H. Ling Roth (1917, pp. 113-150) offers the opinion that the vertical cotton loom of Egypt may have migrated along the north African shore, across the Sahara, and into Nigeria. The reed canoes and harpoons used by the Buduma of Lake Chad are definitely like those pictured in ancient Egyptian drawings. Almost everywhere in Africa coiled basketry is made by a technique that was employed in Egypt five thousand years ago. Those who favor independent invention as an explanation of the occurrence of like forms would point out that the similarities might occur through convergence as a result of similar needs, the presence of identical materials, and existence of certain obvious ways of manufacture. Yet adoption is easier than invention, since creative genius is rare, and a detailed examination of the subject might prove</page><page sequence="73">78 Source Book for African Anthropology that the cultural influence of Asia and Egypt has been widely diffused in north Africa. We need, however, an accurate time scheme. In the 18th dynasty (1600 b.c.) Egypt founded an empire in western Asia, and about this time Egyptian armies occupied the Sudan south of Egyptian territory, where Negro kingdoms exercised considerable power. Rameses III invaded and conquered the south of Palestine several centuries later, after which exploit he marched through Syria and returned to Egypt laden with spoil. But in 680 b.c. the Egyptians encountered misfortune when their country was invaded by Esarhaddon, King of Assyria, who con? quered Memphis. A century and a half later, the Nile Valley was under the dominion of Persian rulers. In addition to acknowledging Egypt as a focal point for the reception and distribution of Asiatic traits, the importance of Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, and Arabs should be considered in chronological sequence, for each of these influenced the culture of Egypt and other parts of north Africa. A valuable summary of his? torical events in north Africa with special reference to the eastern Libyans has been prepared by Bates (1914), who presents an exten? sive bibliography of Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and modern French sources. The history of the Libyans is considered in two main periods: namely, from protodynastic times to 1000 b.c., and from that date to the Arab conquest in the seventh century of our era. From Egyptian texts and sculptures inferences are drawn respecting the dress, tattooing, material culture, religion, and social life of the Libyans. For modern history of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan see MacMichael (1934). phoenicians The date at which the Phoenicians separated from the Semitic matrix to which they belong is unknown, but a thousand years before the Christian era the Phoenicians were a thriving commercial nation occupying a narrow strip of seaboard at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea. This territory, about three hundred miles long and thirty miles wide, was named Phoenicia by the Greeks. Expansion on the landward side was checked by the mountains of Lebanon, and by hostile tribes, the Philistines, to whom the Phoe? nicians paid tribute. Although of such small size, Phoenicia con? tained twenty-five cities, of which Tyre and Sidon were the most important. Of the former city Zechariah said, "Tyre did build herself a stronghold and heaped up silver as dust, also fine gold as the mire of the streets."</page><page sequence="74">History 79 The language of the Phoenicians was a Semitic tongue having affinities with other Semitic languages, namely, Hebrew and Arabic. Punic is the name given to the Phoenician dialect spoken at Carthage, and though a dead language it has been studied from inscriptions near Carthage and other Phoenician settlements of north Africa. Some of the signs employed in Punic survive as elements of the T'ifinagh alphabet, which is still written by a few Tuareg (Table 9, p. 303). The religious beliefs of the Phoenicians recognized a pan? theon of gods, one of which was Moloch, to whom human sacrifices were offered. M. A. Levy's "Ph?nizische Studien" (1856-70) is an old but standard work on Phoenician history and customs. The Phoenicians were concerned chiefly with trade, and war? fare formed no part of their ambition. The Carthaginians were satisfied with local conquests and the enlisting of mercenary troops from Berber and Negro tribes in the neighborhood of Carthage, but no subjugation of the far hinterland was attempted. Cultural influences spread through the agency of trade, which was carried on round the west coast as far as territory now known as Sierra Leone. In view of early Phoenician enterprise, there is no difficulty in believing that some cultural traits from north Africa reached the coast of west Africa, either by sea or across the Sahara. Bovill (1933a, chap. 2, pp. 13-22) gives a summary of Phoenician discovery and states that possibly Hanno reached Gabun River, north of the Congo estuary. He believes that the historical evidence is sufficient to suggest an overland trade from Carthage to the western Sudan. The archaeology of Carthage has been described by Ehrenberg (1927), Gsell (1913-28: vol. 2, pp. 1-92; vols. 1-4, passim), and Hard (1934). H. R. Palmer (1931) has discussed the west coast voyage of Hanno, a Carthaginian. The Phoenicians were expert makers of purple dyes, linen, woolen goods, cotton fabrics, silk, glass, and pottery. Copper was obtained from the island of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean, while longer voyages were made through the Strait of Gibraltar to the Scilly Islands near the coast of Britain, where tin was obtained. The amalgamation of tin and copper forms bronze. The Phoenicians were well acquainted with the method of terracing hillsides, a process which was necessary in their homeland in order to increase the area of cultivation. To what extent these factors of Phoenician culture were transmitted to west Africa will possibly remain undetermined, for cultural resemblances are only suggestive and not conclusive.</page><page sequence="75">80 Source Book for African Anthropology J. L. Myres (1901) presents a photograph of pottery in the market at Khoms or Lebda in Tripoli, the modern representative of Leptis Magna. The pots illustrate in a remarkable way the extent to which successive cultures may flood an area without extinguishing old cultures. The pots definitely preserve bronze age, Phoenician, Graeco-Roman, and early Arab types. Among the Yoruba of Nigeria certain forms of art, including terra cotta heads and stone figures of human beings, bear some resemblance to Phoenician style (Delattre, 1896; Cagnat, 1909; Kelsey, 1926). Monolithic pillars and stone circles of Gambia and other parts of west Africa may also be due to Phoenician influence. At If 6 in Nigeria (Fig. 84) priests in charge of a certain sacred grove where terra c?tta heads are preserved have robes and mitered head? dresses resembling those shown in some Carthaginian sculptures, and these factors, combined with the Phoenician traits previously mentioned, may be intrusions into Negro culture (Hambly, 1935a, pp. 464-468). During eight centuries Phoenician power was consolidated in the Mediterranean, but about two centuries after the founding of Carthage the state of Rome came into existence (753 b.c.). At first the Romans struggled for independence against the Etruscans of northern Italy. Later they consolidated their power and defeated the Greeks, but for a long period the issue of the struggle between Rome and Carthage was doubtful. Hannibal, Carthaginian statesman and general, crossed from north Africa into Spain, thence by Alpine passes into Italy, where he dominated the situation for thirteen years. He was finally expelled (Livy, xxi, xxn). The Romans, who were not originally a maritime people, built a fleet, and from that time onward they took aggressive measures against Carthage. A series of conflicts known as the Punic wars ended in the utter destruction of Carthage in the year 146 b.c. greeks and romans From this period Roman power in the Mediterranean was extended and stabilized, and today roads, aqueducts, and remains of cities such as Timgad and Tebessa attest the thoroughness of the Roman occupation. Cyrenaica became a Roman province, as also did Egypt, which, on the death of Cleopatra, about thirty years before the birth of Christ, was ruled by a Roman prefect. Bovill (1933a) shows a map of the Roman Empire extending about four hundred miles inland from the Mediterranean. The tribes known</page><page sequence="76">History 81 as Garamantes occupied territory now called the Fezzan. The Gaetuli lived in northwest Africa, and the Nobatae and Blemmeys in the Nile Valley. Bates (1914) has brought together a series of ethnographical maps of north Africa according to data from Herod? otus, Scylax, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, Pliny, Ptolemy, and Arabian geographers. Newbold (1928) has discussed these classical sources, and Milne (1898) has prepared a "History of Egypt under Roman Rule." Boissier (1899, 1901) has written descriptions of the archae? ology of Roman Africa in Algeria and Tunis. Bunbury (1883) has published a compendium on the Greek and Roman period in Africa. Gautier (1937) has made an important contribution. Under Roman dominion Christianity was founded in Egypt, and tradition says that St. Mark preached the gospel in Alexandria about a.d. 69. Despite persecution, the new religion became en? trenched, though often under debased forms which incorporated the deities and magical rites of the religion of ancient Egypt. In desert monasteries the scriptures were translated into Greek and Coptic. The spread of Christianity (a.d. 50-400) is important when studying the ethnology of Abyssinia at the present time. Actuated by religious zeal, and to some extent compelled by persecution, Coptic monks carried Christianity into Abyssinia in the fourth century, from which time the Abyssinian church has existed. The schisms of the early church led to the formation of sects known as Gnostics, Monophysites, and Nestorians, whose views differed respecting the theological background of Christianity. Divergent creeds evolved respecting the divinity of Christ, the nature of the Holy Ghost and the Trinity, and the extent to which factors of Egyptian religion might be incorporated in the Christian faith. Three centuries before our era Greek rulers named Ptolemies administered the region of the Nile Delta (Mahaffy, 1899), and before this the Greeks, and their forerunners the Aegeans, had made daring voyages, in rivalry with Phoenician competitors. Ptolemy I founded the Alexandrian Library and Museum, and his successor built the Pharos Lighthouse at Alexandria, a beacon which was regarded in ancient times as one of the seven wonders of the world. Pending further archaeological work in the hinterland of north Africa, an estimation of the inland spread of Greek culture would be premature, but linguistic research by H. R. Palmer (1932, p. 305) has shown the existence of Greek words in Kanuri, a language spoken north of Lake Chad in central Africa. Some characters</page><page sequence="77">82 Source Book for African Anthropology of the Greek alphabet have been incorporated into Tifinagh, a script known to a few Tuareg. Notwithstanding the importance of Greek maritime enterprise along the north coast, the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great in 331 b.c., and the rule of the Ptolemies, the Greek period bears little relation to the history and ethnology of Africa as a whole. Although the Roman Empire had completely annihilated her Phoenician rival, Roman power in north Africa was not uncontested. Berber tribes, who are part of the northern Hamites, revolted, notably under Jugurtha. To the Romans this man was a rebel; to his countrymen he was a patriot. The defeated Jugurtha fled, only to be betrayed to his Roman enemies, who, according to custom, paraded him through the streets of Rome, and then allowed him to perish in a dungeon. Opposition to the Roman Empire was not confined to the northern coast of Africa. Warlike Libyan tribes of the desert west of the Nile, and Hamitic and Negro tribes on the eastern banks of that river demanded constant alertness on the part of Roman garrisons. Latin names for these tribes occur repeatedly in the works of Roman historians, but the identification of the ancient names with present day tribes is not always certain (Bates, 1914, p. 132; Palmer, 1936b). Mention has been made of the journey of Roman centurions to the Upper Nile, and it seems probable that Julius Maternus crossed the Sudan through Kordofan to the oasis in which Bilma is situated. From this point he appears to have returned to Fezzan in Tripolitania. Roman explorers of two thousand years ago returned from Saharan exploration with stories of a great river, the Niger, which drains the greater part of west Africa. Reports of this river were in circulation even in the time of Herodotus in the fifth century before Christ, and the information brought back by Julius Maternus, a.d. 150, served to stimulate geographical interest, until at last the mystery of the Niger's course was solved by the Landers in the early part of the nineteenth century. After several centuries of sovereignty in north Africa and Egypt, Rome experienced shattering defeat such as she had inflicted on the Phoenicians and Greeks. From northern Europe came Teutonic tribes, the Vandals, who wrested the north African provinces from Rome and sacked the city of Rome itself in the year a.d. 455. Cultural traits of the Romans are not known to have penetrated far inland, but the Yoruba of Nigeria have a-structure for collecting rain, and this bears a resemblance to the Roman impluvium. Some</page><page sequence="78">History 83 horsemen of the Bauchi plateau, Nigeria, wear protective metal shin-guards which are not unlike Roman greaves. Yet, on the whole, the influence of the Roman conquest appears to have been confined to the northern littoral. Contact with Negroes influenced the literature and art of Greece and Rome (Beardsley, 1929). byzantine influence The importance of Byzantium should be recognized, since a cer? tain architectural style and many works of art are described as Byzantine (Diehl, 1890). The adjective is derived from the name of the town Byzantium, which was founded about 657 b.c. on the shores of the Bosporus, where now stands the Turkish city of Istanbul (Constantinople). From the time of its cultural maturity under Justinian in the sixth century of our era, the city of Byzantium spread an influence that affected the art and architecture of eastern Europe and north Africa until the twelfth century. The Byzantine style, which is exemplified by the mosque of St. Sophia in Constantinople, and St. Mark's in Venice, is highly ornamental, having elaborate carvings, mosaic work, floral decora? tions at the heads of columns, lofty domes, and vaulted arches. The Byzantines (Dalton, 1911) worked in gold, ivory, textiles, and silver with a skill that has certainly affected the crafts of north Africa, and possibly even those of west African Negroes. The Tuareg of the Sahara use the design of the cross for the hilts of their swords and daggers. They have this design on the wooden posts of their camel saddles, and as a neck ornament some persons wear an Agades cross. An art form of this kind might arise independently, but on the contrary there may be truth in the suggestion that these designs are derived from a Christian motif which was common in Byzantine decoration. jews The part played by Jews in this complex history of north Africa is not one which is important for the continent as a whole, yet the presence of colonies of Jews in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Tripolita nia, Egypt, and Abyssinia is of sufficient interest to call for comment. After becoming detached from the Semites of southwest Asia, the Israelites, who evolved a written language called Hebrew, at a later date settled for a period in Egypt. The story of their serfdom under the Egyptians, their exodus, wandering, and consolidation in Palestine are matters of Biblical history, which also gives a clear</page><page sequence="79">84 Source Book for African Anthropology account of their social organization under a patriarchal system in which the oldest male ruled the family. The Bible makes clear a gradual evolution of religious thought, moral codes, laws of inherit? ance and succession, along with anthropological data describing taboos, omens, magical practices, and witchcraft (J. G. Frazer, 1927). Much of the lore of the Old Testament is recognizable as Semitic, and as such was shared by Phoenicians, and later by Arabs. We should therefore recognize that wherever Jews settled in Africa they tended to establish Semitic customs, as, for example, circumcision and use of the scapegoat, which were of remote antiquity among the Semites of Arabia (W. Robertson Smith, 1889, p. 296; 1907, pp. 57, 61). Three centuries before Christ large settlements of Jews existed in Lower Egypt, where Alexandria was one of their chief centers of commerce. Gradually these Jewish colonies extended along the north coast of Africa, through Cyrenaica, and even to Mauretania in the far west. The destruction of Jerusalem in the year a.d. 70 no doubt added to the population of these African settlements, and it is certain that Jewish immigrants were numerous when the Jews were expelled from Spain and Portugal in the fifteenth century. The most important southward migration of Jews was probably that of about a.d. 115. Two routes were followed, one by way of Air, Niger, and Senegal, and the other from Morocco through Mauretania. In the oases of the Sahara the Jews preserved their identity, but in the Sudan they were absorbed into the native population (Bovill, 1933a, p. 27). The origin of the Jews in Abyssinia is unknown. Evidently the Jews, named Falashas (Fig. 38, right), have mingled with some dark skinned strain, possibly Negroes of Abyssinia, for they are darkly pigmented; hence the name Black Jews. The Falashas segregate themselves from all other sects, including Christians, and in church organization, belief, and ritual they jealously guard many Old Testa? ment beliefs and practices. The part which Jews have played in the history of south Africa has been described by L. Herrman (1930). "Hebrewism of West Africa," by J. J. Williams (1930), is a com? pilation that should be critically consulted. There are therein some informative data relating to infiltrations of ancient Semitic beliefs and customs. These are, however, treated as being specifically Jewish. arabian culture More important than any of the historical facts yet mentioned is the part played by Mohammedan culture. Mohammed, who was</page><page sequence="80">History 85 born early in the seventh century of our era, added traits of religion, government, law, and art to the fundamentals of early Semitic life. Then, under an impetus of religious fervor, the Arabs, with Semitic background now carrying the new factors of Koranic teaching, swept into the Nile Valley, which they conquered in a.d. 641. Gibb (1926) has provided a useful synopsis of Arabic literature together with a bibliography, and Lane-Poole (1901) has given a succinct account of the Arab dynasties in Egypt. From the Nile as a focus the Arabs spread along north Africa and established Kairwan near the site of the ruined Carthage. Then they continued westward and crossed into Spain, where the archi? tecture of southern cities such as Granada attests Arabian influence. Under Tarik the Omayyad caliphs of Egypt ruled north Africa from the Nile to Morocco until the middle of the eighth century. About this time the Omayyad dynasty was overthrown by the Abbasids, of whom the well-known Harun-al-Rashid, a famous caliph of the "Arabian Nights," was a distinguished ruler. Through Arab rule, which extended to north India and Persia, cultural con? tacts between north Africa and the middle east were effected. In the eleventh century there spread along north Africa and across the Sahara into the Sudan a wave of Arab conquest, carrying Mohammedanism and cultural adhesions that have been summarized by Hambly (1935a, pp. 462-463). The influence of the Mohammedan expansion on arts and handicrafts has been well described by Dimand (1930) in a beautifully illustrated guide to these works of art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. This second invasion was far more important than that of the seventh century, the effects of which were somewhat transient. The later Arab invasion imposed the Mohammedan religion on the Tuareg and other Saharan tribes, and in addition the kingdoms of the Niger were affected by religious and other cultural influences of the Arab conquerors. Further, the rule of Arab dynasties in the Nile Valley gave an impetus to tribes of Hamitic culture, who traveled westward and imposed their physique, language, and culture on some Negro tribes of west Africa. The most important of these tribes traveling westward were the Zagawa, who penetrated the western Sudan where they stimulated the Mali Empire and the Soninke Dynasty (Bovill, 1933a, p. 48; MacMichael, 1912b, pp. 288-344; Palmer, 1928). Following the Beni Hillal and Soleim Arab invasions of north Africa, the Mohammedanizing of west African Negroes proceeded steadily. The process of overlaying Negro and Hamitic culture</page><page sequence="81">86 Source Book for African Anthropology with Mohammedan beliefs and practices continues at the present time, and although local resistance has occurred, notably among the Mossi of the middle Niger and the pagan tribes of the Bauchi plateau, it may be said that Islamic influence has profoundly affected Africa north of the equator. It is true that some Negro tribes have no more than a superficial acceptance of Mohammedanism, for the converts do not pray, observe the festivals, or know the precepts of the Koran. But, on the contrary, a further study of physical anthropology, languages, and modes of life will prove the deep penetration of Arab influences in some regions. In this connection the different possibilities of miscegenation should be borne in mind. Physical mixture of Arabs and Negroes has occurred, for Arabs had concubinage with their Negro slaves, and some persons of Negro physique will describe themselves as Arabs because they or their ancestors were honored slaves in an Arab household. Language may be adopted without physical mix? ture or the transmission of culture; or, again, a cultural trait, for example, the Mohammedan religion, may be accepted by tribes which still retain their own languages and other cultural elements. The Tuareg, for instance, have taken Mohammedanism as their religion, but they have not intermarried with Arabs; they retain their own language, Tamashek; and they regard Arabs as their enemies. Mohammedanism advanced across the Sahara into the Negro kingdoms of west Africa not only by conquest. Large numbers of Mohammedan ascetics, named the almoravides or marabouts, preached the tenets of their faith and organized their followers on a military basis. Under Ibn Yacin the almoravides were consolidated, and when he was killed in a.d. 1057 control passed to Abu Bakr, then to Yusuf, his nephew. In 1062 Yusuf founded Marrakesh and captured Fez. He then entered Spain and took Granada, but the almoravides were finally expelled from Spain and defeated by Berber tribes of north Africa. From the bend of the River Niger to Lake Chad a succession of empires was founded by tribes of Negro blood, with some infusion of Hamitic elements of physique, language, and culture. An outline of historical events in the western Sudan has been given by Maurice Delafosse (translation by Fligelman, 1931), and H. R. Palmer (1928) has made many important contributions to our knowledge of this period. At present only a small amount of archaeological work has been done on sites of west African Negro civilizations, and further research among documents of the period a.d. 1050-1500 is necessary.</page><page sequence="82">History 87 Yet the outline of events is known. At intervals new documents are acquired, or some of those which have been in European archives for many years are translated (Palmer, 1936b). The powerful kingdom of Ghana on the Niger was mentioned for the first time by Masudi, who died a.d. 956. Ibn Haukal visited the site a few years later, and El Bekri gave a fairly detailed descrip? tion of the city in the eleventh century. Archaeological excavations by Bonnel de M^ziered in the year 1914 have confirmed the descrip? tion of El Bekri (Monteil, 1932). For several centuries the states of Ghana and Songhai flourished simultaneously. The history of Songhai is intimately connected with the powerful kingdom of Melle, which was built up by the Mandingo. Melle reached its zenith in the period 1308-31, at which time the empire covered the western Sudan, including the state of Songhai and the Tuareg town of Timbuktu. Ibn Batuta, who visited Melle in 1352, makes clear that the Melle Empire was the most important political, religious, and commercial center in the Sudan. By the end of the fifteenth century Melle had been overthrown and succeeded by Songhai, which in turn was devastated by El Mansur of Morocco in 1591. The writings of Ibn Edrisi (1099-1154), Ibn Batuta (1325-54), and Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406) were all valuable historical contributions. In the sixteenth century Leo Africanus described his travels across the Sahara, and from the bend of the Niger to Lake Chad, thence across the desert again to north Africa. This exploration provided data which were all that historians and geographers had for guidance during the following two hundred years (for translations see W. M. Slane, El Bekri, Ibn Batuta, Ibn Haukal, Ibn Khaldun, and Leo Africanus). zimbabwe and the arabs In connection with Arab penetration of Africa the Zimbabwe ruins of the southeast should be briefly described. The ruins, which are built on the site of ancient gold mines, are historically connected with the trading activities of Arabs on the lower east coast of Africa, about a.d. 1000, but the racial identity of the builders and the date of construction are unknown (see also A. T. Curie, 1937). For many years the Zimbabwe ruins had a romantic reputation based on an alleged connection with King Solomon, circa 1000 b.c., whose supplies of gold were said to have come from this region. The name Zimbabwe is used by the Makalanga tribe of Southern Rhodesia for the dwelling of a principal chief, and it is natural that such a</page><page sequence="83">88 Source Book for African Anthropology name should be transferred to any well-built structure. The Ellipti? cal Temple has a circumference of 830 feet, and the enclosing wall is 15 feet thick and 32 feet high. The structure is built of stone blocks made from material that is abundant on the surrounding kopjes, and the blocks have been trimmed to fit with accuracy, even though no mortar has been used. It could not be said that Negroes never build with stone, but the Zimbabwe structures suggest a foreign influence for the planning and supervision of the architecture. C. G. Stevens (1931) has suggested a chronology for the several types of architecture which he illustrates in detail. European interest in Zimbabwe began in the year 1867, when Phillips and Renders discovered the ruins during bush travel. Four years later, Karl Mauch stated that the ruins were a copy of King Solomon's temple, an unwarranted statement, but one that aroused popular interest and imagination. In 1892 T. Bent collected many of the objects which are now in the South African Museum, and in the course of his observations came to the conclusion that the site had a Syrian origin. Following the work of Bent considerable damage was done by curio hunters, who are said to have taken a thousand ounces of gold ornaments. The site was subsequently examined, though not completely, by R. N. Hall (1895-1903), and a little later by Randall Maclver (1906), who expressed the opinion that the ruins were not of great antiquity. Arabian geographers of the ninth and tenth centuries of our era describe a land of Zendj in the hinterland of the present port of Beira in Portuguese East Africa, where African natives had supplies of gold. A trade in gold between Africa and India is also mentioned in these chronicles. Da Barros, writing in 1552, spoke of a fortress of dry walling called Zimbabwe, already old, and the source of super? stitions and folklore among Negroes and Arabs. As early as 1721 Da Costa suggested that King Solomon obtained gold for his temple from Zimbabwe, and the belief was perpetuated for more than two centuries. In the neighborhood of Zimbabwe soapstone is found, and this is readily worked into ornamental forms; for example, Bushmen of today make it into bowls for tobacco pipes. It is not surprising, therefore, that excavations at Zimbabwe should yield objects of soapstone. These include columns, bowls, birds, and objects said to be an imitation of the phallus. Carvings of the male sexual organ have suggested the former presence of fertility cults and phallic worship as part of the religious exercises of ancient inhabitants.</page><page sequence="84">History 89 The site has yielded fragments of Chinese porcelain, dark blue glaze of Persian make, Arabian glass, gold bangles, crucibles and furnaces for smelting gold, spindle whorls of soapstone and clay, and types of black pottery and red ware that resemble present-day products of potters in the neighborhood. Ingots of copper in the form of a letter X and molds of the same shape have been discovered. Bronze was used from the earliest period of the site, and analysis of the alloy, which contains 12 per cent of tin, indicates considerable metallurgical ability. The tin and copper could have been obtained locally. Iron and evidence of its manufacture occur at the lowest levels of excavation. A recent survey of Zimbabwe has been made by Miss Caton Thompson (1929) who has published a summary of the historical facts, the conflicting hypotheses of archaeologists, and the results of personal excavation. Another summary and bibliography has been compiled in Italian by Cipriani (1932), who gives an extensive bibliography. The presence of imported beads in bed-rock levels is crucial evidence for fixing an approximate date for the earliest foundations. Experts are of the opinion that the beads are of a type made in India in the ninth and tenth centuries of our era, and any date earlier than a.d. 200 for the origin of the buildings is improbable. A period of four centuries, probably a.d. 900-1300, is allowed for the rise, prosperity, and collapse of the civilization that existed at Zimbabwe. This, however, should not be regarded as a final judg? ment, for the ruins are still under investigation. Lowe (1936, pp. 282-289) reports that at Mapungubwe in the northern Transvaal excavations have yielded gold beads and gold ornaments, colored beads, Chinese porcelain, ivory, copper, bronze, and iron. Some of the objects resemble those discovered at Zimbabwe, and there is evidence of a widely spread medieval culture. In the year 1517 Arab dynasties in Egypt were overthrown by the Turks, who had taken Constantinople in 1453, and the Ottoman Empire became a power in north Africa. But in 1584 a Turkish fleet was defeated by the Portuguese near Mombasa, and Turkish suzerainty slowly succumbed before attacks of the English and French, until Turkish rule in north Africa was definitely ended during the World War of 1914-18. The foregoing summary of datable events has brought our historical survey up to the European period of exploration and con? quest, which will be described in section IV. The historical review of Egyptians, Phoenicians, Romans, Greeks, and Arabs has peeled</page><page sequence="85">90 Source Book for African Anthropology off only a surface layer of the cultures of man in a restricted part of Africa, and the period we have dealt with is almost negligible com? pared with the total lapse of time since Pleistocene man first made his appearance in Africa. Prehistoric evidence has, therefore, to attempt a reconstruction of African history over a long era extending from early Pleistocene times to 4000 b.c. The duration of the Pleistocene period is a matter of conjecture and controversy, but according to Schuchert and Dunbar (1933, p. 432) "all students of Pleistocene history now agree that the entire duration of the Pleis? tocene was at least several hundred thousand years. It probably exceeded a million years." There is uncertainty, too, as to when the Pleistocene ended and the Recent period began, but perhaps a duration of 25,000 to 30,000 years is a fair estimate of the length of the Recent period.</page><page sequence="86">III. PREHISTORY Fossil Man In the "Descent of Man" Charles Darwin (1892, p. 155) writes: "In each region of the world the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region. It is, therefore, probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by apes closely allied to the gorilla and the chimpanzee; and as these two species are now man's nearest allies, it is somewhat more probable that our early pro? genitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere. But it is useless to speculate on this subject; for two or three anthropomor? phous apes, one the Dryopithecus of Lartet, nearly as large as a man, and closely allied to Hylobates, existed in Europe during the Miocene age; and since so remote a period the earth has certainly undergone many great revolutions, and there has been ample time for migration on the largest scale." Of the anthropoid apes perhaps the gorilla has attracted most attention popularly and scientifically. The distribution of this ape is limited to a belt of equatorial Africa north and south of the equator, but the chimpanzees are more widely distributed. The interest of physical anthropologists has been specially concentrated on the anatomical characters of chimpanzees, gorillas, orang-utans, and gibbons (the two latter not found in Africa). All these anthropoids are regarded as members of a primitive primate stock which ultimately produced Homo sapiens, though anthropologists are not fully agreed on the lines of evolution. A simple exposition of the phylogenetic relationship of the anthropoids to man will be found in the works of Coolidge (1929), Keith (1929), and Hooton (1931). In addition to the tailless apes of Africa there are many species of monkeys with tails, which are not, however, used for hanging from the branches of trees. This prehensile habit is followed by monkeys of South America, but not by African monkeys. Dogfaced baboons are common in rocky hills of Africa. Baboons play a prominent part in Negro folklore, and they entered into the mythology and spiritual beliefs of the Egyptians, who represented them pictorially. But the gorilla and the chimpanzee are the two extant African forms that are of primary interest in a scheme of human evolution. Hooton (1931, p. 381) states that "Africa's contribution to the history of higher primate evolution is already generous." The 91</page><page sequence="87">92 Source Book for African Anthropology principal items are Parapithecus, the earliest fossil monkey yet known; Propliopithecus, the first anthropoid ape; Dryopithecus mogharensis, most ancient of the giant primates; Australopithecus, alleged to be a humanoid ape of the Pliocene; and Homo rhodesiensis, the gorilla-browed specimen of the Broken Hill mine. Yet, despite Hooton's optimism respecting this evidence from Africa, a glance at a map prepared by E. W. Smith (1935, p. 31) indicates that very few sites have yielded remains of ancient man. Of the nineteen sites marked on the map, nine are clustered east of Lake Victoria Nyanza, four in a narrow area in the extreme south? east of the continent, and only three in the north, leaving most of the twelve million square miles with no evidence whatever. Hooton (1931) and E. W. Smith (1935) have provided a summary of these discoveries, but to use the words of the latter "there is as yet not much to be told," and one might add that the little which is known is controversial. Let us see how debatable points arise, and how the conclusions of experts differ. Since several accounts of fossil man have stressed the writings of Keith (1929, 1931) and G. E. Smith (1927), we will glean our data from an article by Hrdlicka (1926, pp. 173-204), who in 1925 visited the site where Homo rhodesiensis was discovered in 1921. At once Hrdlicka touches on the circumstances of discovery, and these were of the kind that are bound to lead to differences of opinion when fragments are examined. "The lack of precise information on certain important points was soon felt by students of the subject; and it now seems that even what was known at first suffered some subsequent confusion. There was a desire for more data regarding the position of the skull, its surroundings, the cave itself, and its fillings. The nature of the animal bones in the cave, and other points were not sufficiently well documented." Hrdlicka then reviews the literature that had accumulated from the time of the first newspaper reports, and, during all this, "errors of a serious nature have crept into the accounts of the circumstances of the discovery, and these have already materially affected important conclusions." "Five months after the discovery the skull, a number of human as well as other bones were brought to England by the manager of the mine." Here again we see from Hrdlicka's narrative how discussion and divergent views arise. Quoting Hrdlicka (p. 102), "Above all, it became an accepted idea that several human bones brought to England with the skull were found with the cranium</page><page sequence="88">Prehistory 93 and belonged to the same individual or the same people, and from the characteristics of these bones deductions were made as to the morphological and even chronological status of the Rhodesian man." Of Rhodesian man Hrdlicka says, "The skull itself is positively not the skull of any known African type of man or their normal variants. Neither is it any known pathological monstrosity such as giantism or leontiasis. It is a remarkable specimen, of which the age, provenience, history, and nature are still anthropological puzzles. Morphologically, the skull is frequently associated with the Neanderthal type of Europe. This may be fundamentally correct, but only to that extent. In its detailed characteristics the specimen is in some respects inferior, in others superior, to anything known as yet of the Neanderthal man." Hrdlicka continues with a record of his interrogation of persons connected with the find, and when eyewitnesses were not available for questioning, some information was gained through correspondence. For the views of Pycraft (1928), we must turn to a report on "Rhodesian Man, and Associated Remains" (p. 46). "Highly specialized in some particulars, the skull must nevertheless be regarded as of a relatively low type, having a definite resemblance to the skulls of Neanderthal man, with which race it has affinities." Some criticism of Pycraft's work is given by Hrdlicka (p. 117), and one point to which exception is taken is Pycraft's recognition of a new genus, Cyphanthropus, for the Rhodesian skull. A protest from W. E. Le Gros Clark (1928) shows how cautious one should be in accepting a single report, even from competent authority. Pro? fessor Clark's criticism reads: "Mr. Py craft has given a description of the skeletal remains and, basing his evidence on these, has seen fit to create a new genus of Hominidae?Cyphanthropus. There are a number of points in his description which call for criticism, but since the evidence of the pelvis has been so remarkably misinter? preted, and since this bone is the most important indication for the creation of a new genus, I will confine my remarks to this part of the skeleton." The criticism then points out that the evidence for regarding a portion of the left ilium as belonging to the Rhodesian find is not convincing. The account continues to expose alleged errors that led Pycraft to reconstruct a pelvis with an acetabulum which "bears no resemblance to any Primate." Pycraft's orienta? tion of the pelvis is questioned, and in conclusion the critic states: "When these curious errors are rectified, it will be seen that, according to the diagnosis given by Mr. Pycraft on page 49 of his</page><page sequence="89">94 Source Book for African Anthropology monograph, the genus Cyphanthropus depends entirely on certain features of the skull. I find it impossible to believe that a comparison between the Rhodesian skull and the skulls of Neanderthal man will justify the creation of a separate genus for the former." Keith states (1931, p. 117) that in brain and skull Rhodesian man is so primitive that were we moved by anatomical evidence alone we should place him at the very beginning of the Pleistocene series of cultures, but if we give geological evidence full weight, it does seem possible that he may have survived long enough to become con? temporary with Neanderthal man in Europe. Keith then turns to discussion of the criticism passed on his conclusions by Hrdlicka and by Pycraft. Sir Arthur thinks that "in the case of the Rhodesian find there should not be any hesitation in assigning the tibia to the skull; in texture, preservation, conformation, and colouring the tibia answers to the skull." The question of associating the limb bones with the skull is of primary importance, for, in Keith's opinion, "did we know only his skull we should regard him as a possible ancestor of Nean? derthal man; his limb bones separate him widely from Neanderthal man and reveal his close relationship to neanthropic or modern man." After recapitulating the observations of Pycraft and the criticism offered by Le Gros Clark, Keith concludes with the verdict that there is no need for a new genus named Cyphanthropus, or "stooping man"; the original name Homo rhodesiensis given by Sir Arthur Smith Woodward is appropriate. Furthermore, "Rhodesian man has certain points of kinship to Neanderthal man, but stands in his major characters nearer the ancestral line of modern man." Keith (1931, p. 53) thinks that Australopithecus, the Taungs skull, recovered from a matrix by Professor Dart, is in all essential features an anthropoid ape. "It shares so many features with the two surviving African anthropoids?the gorilla and chimpanzee? that, to account for their common heritage, we must suppose that all three have come from the same stem. The features wherein Australopithecus departs from living African anthropoids and makes an approach toward man cannot be permitted to outweigh the pre? dominance of its anthropoid affinities." Minute examination of the evidence, and especially of that relat? ing to teeth, size of brain, and endocranial cast, leads Keith to the conclusion (1931, p. 116) that the evidence is best explained by supposing Australopithecus "to have sprung as a branch of the phy? lum which gave us the gorilla and the chimpanzee, and not, as</page><page sequence="90">Prehistory 95 Professor Dart contends, from the root of the human phylum. That Australopithecus should manifest humanoid characters more promi? nently than either the chimpanzee or the gorilla need not astonish us; the great anthropoids and man have a common inheritance drawn from the same stem. In brief the discovery at Taungs has given us not a human ancestor but an extinct cousin of the gorilla and chimpanzee." Dr. P. Alsberg (1934, No. 179) has presented some criticism of Sir Arthur Keith's comments relating to the geology, biology, and morphology of the Taungs skull, which Alsberg regards as possibly human. He concludes: "If we were to paint a theoretical picture of the first stages of man, we should necessarily arrive at a form such as the Taungs child presents: the jaws are beginning to recede, the brain is about to increase. If Dr. Broom's opinion is correct that the Taungs creature belonged in the time of the Lower Pliocene, then the geological antiquity would also not bar the supposition that the being was human. The Taungs race would then represent a human stage far older than the Trinil (Java) race, and correspondingly much more primitive." Past experience has emphasized the need for caution in drawing conclusions from fossilized fragments of bone. But a written report by R. Broom (1936) establishes the importance of a recent discovery at Sterkfontein near Krugersdorp in the Transvaal. The fossils consist of the base of a skull, part of the face, and a good maxilla with three teeth. Apparently these fragments represent the skull of a large-brained anthropoid ape belonging to the same genus as the Taungs ape. Probably these fossils represent a skull which had a length of 145 mm. from glabella to occiput, a maximum parietal width of 96 mm., and a capacity of 600 cc. The brow ridges are moderately well developed, and there are two fairly large frontal sinuses. The skull is clearly that of a fairly large anthropoid, more closely allied to the Miocene and Pliocene species of Dryopithecus than to the living chimpanzee and gorilla. The skull may have been of the same genus as the Taungs ape, but of a different species. Dr. Broom concludes: "It seems moderately certain that during the greater part of the Pleistocene and possibly during the Pliocene, large, non-forest-living anthropoids flourished in south Africa, and not improbably it was from one of the Pliocene members of this group that the first man was evolved." We must, however, await further discussion before accepting these statements as final.</page><page sequence="91">96 Source Book for African Anthropology If we accept Homo rhodesiensis as somewhat Neanderthaloid, and Australopithecus as possibly simian, there remains the important Boskop skull, which is definitely human, for inclusion in the phylo genetic tree. The finding of the Boskop skull in 1913 has been followed by more recent discoveries that help to establish the relationship of the Boskop type to other races of south Africa. Keith (1931, p. 123) states that F. W. Fitzsimmons has discovered more than fifty burials of the Boskop type "and it has been demonstrated that the Boskop type merges into a later people, the Strandloopers. The Strand loopers in turn merge into the smaller-headed Bushman and Hotten? tot types. The Boskop type (length 205 mm., breadth 154 mm., capacity 1630 cc), if not a direct ancestor of the Bushman, yet stands near the line which evolved into this type. Occasional Bushmen possess large heads of the Boskop type." Keith (1931, p. 117) states that on the information available Boskop man may be regarded as Late Paleolithic in date, practicing a culture corresponding to the Aurignacian in Europe. Fish Hoek Bay is situated about fifteen miles due south of Cape Town, .and in Skildergat Cave on the shore of the bay B. Peers and his son, assisted by A. J. H. Goodwin and M. R. Drennan, have unearthed skeletons of Bushman type. According to Keith (1931, p. 132) a skull from a deep stratum is that of a Bushman of primitive and remarkable kind having a cranial capacity of 1600 cc. Keith (p. 139) is of the opinion that all recent evidence points to south Africa as the evolutionary cradle of the Bushman type. This view of the Bushman type as being evolved in south Africa is, as our archaeological evidence will show later, contrary to a somewhat general opinion of prehistorians, who think of the Bushman type as having migrated from north Africa. We may not, however, dismiss the phylogeny of the Bushman with ease and assurance; there are too many conflicting hypotheses. These have been collated and discussed by Dreyer (1931) in what he calls "The Bushman-Hottentot-Strandlooper Tangle." In this article the author compares the views of Drennan, Stow, P^ringuey, Shrubsall, Broom, Vedder, Spannus, Lebzelter, Hirschberg, and Bayer, of whose writings he gives a bibliography. There is no con? clusion concerning the genetic relationship of Bushmen, Hottentots, Strandloopers, and Boskoids, but the article is useful in giving the outline of a complex problem and in showing how far we are from a solution of that problem.</page><page sequence="92">Prehistory 97 Before we leave the subject of fossil man of south Africa, the dis? covery known as Springbok man, from eighty miles northeast of Pretoria, should be mentioned. Keith (1931, p. 146) has provided an illustration of the skull and mandible as restored by Dr. Broom, and after discussing details of the measurements Keith concludes that "he was a tall strong fellow with a big brain, a long and wide head, and a drawn out face, great mandible and small teeth, a type which we cannot fit into any African racial type known to us. He was cast in a mould altogether different from the Boskop and Fish Hoek men?big-brained and small-faced type." Keith (p. 152) concludes that Springbok man "represents a Negroid or Hamitic type, which made its way southward in pre? historic times probably carrying with him the Aurignacian culture of his time." This Springbok man serves as a geographical though not an anatomical link between the discoveries in lower south Africa and those of Tanganyika and Kenya. The work of Leakey has aroused much interest and criticism, but at the moment there is no final judgment on several important points. The alleged antiquity of some of the fossil human bones is, however, dubious. In "Adam's Ancestors," Leakey (1934b) has given a succinct account of his work in east Africa in the past decade, and this is a simple introduction to his more technical works which have been listed in the bibliography. Beginning with Dr. Hans Reek's discovery of a human fossil at Oldoway, Tanganyika Territory, in 1914 (Reck, 1931), Leakey summarizes the data relating to human fossils since discovered in Kenya. After considerable controversy, it is now generally agreed that this skull can be assigned to the period of the Upper Pleistocene, at about the same period that the Cro-Magnon race flourished in Europe. At one time (Leakey, 1934b, p. 203) thought the Oldoway skeleton was associated with tools of the cultures known as Chellean and Acheulean, very early European stone-age periods, but later research indicated that the Oldoway skeleton was not nearly as ancient as the fossil animals and the stone-age implements found in the same deposit. The skeleton is really to be associated with the later Kenya Aurignacian culture, and to this culture also belong human skeletons found (1928-29) in a rock shelter known as Gamble's Cave II in the Elmenteita region of Kenya Colony. Leakey (1936a, pp. 172-173) plainly states what he means by the Negroid affinities of these fossils. The skulls from Gamble's Cave had straight faces</page><page sequence="93">98 Source Book for African Anthropology instead of the prognathous faces of typical Negroes, but in shape of the forehead they represented the Negro type. Before considering the skeptical views that now prevail, let us take a statement of Leakey (1934b, p. 206). He summarizes the evidence relating to the Kanam mandible found near Homa Moun? tain, Kavirondo Gulf, Lake Victoria Nyanza. "The various animal remains from the same stratum have also been examined with a view to determining the age of this fragment of ancient man. As a result of our studies we can say now that the Kanam mandible represents the oldest yet discovered true ancestor of modern man." Leakey calls attention to details of the teeth which led him to separate his specimen from Homo sapiens and to create a new species Homo kanamensis. The evidence of geology, fossil animals, and stone tools dated the Kanam mandible as Lower Pleistocene. The first skull fragments found by Leakey at Kanjera led to further research and the discovery of fragments of a human skull in an undisturbed stratum near the place where the first fragments had been unearthed. Leakey (1934b, Plate X) shows the two reconstructed Kanjera skulls and the Kanam mandible fragment. A study of associated fossil animals and implements of Chellean type, together with the geological evidence, supported the view that the Kanjera men belonged to the early part of what Leakey calls Middle Pleisto? cene (Lower Pleistocene of other classifications). In "The Stone Age Races of Kenya," Leakey (1935) gives a detailed account of Lower Pleistocene man, Homo kanamensis, also of Middle Pleistocene man of Kanjera, and of Upper Pleistocene man, whose remains are associated with the Upper Kenya Aurignacian culture, phase C. From Leakey's expression of his own opinions, we may turn now to some damaging criticism of his evidence. Boswell (1935) says, "The chief object of my visit was to study the geology of the deposits from which the Kanam mandible and the Kanjera No. 3 skull frag? ments were obtained, for Dr. Leakey had come to the important conclusion that these remains of Homo sapiens type occurred in situ in beds of Lower Pleistocene and Middle Pleistocene Age, respec? tively. Unfortunately, it has not proved possible to find the exact site of either discovery." The criticism calls attention to some con? fusion of photographic records, and states that "the date of entomb? ment of human remains found in such beds would be inherently doubtful.?In view of the uncertain location of the Kanam and Kan? jera sites, and in view also of the doubt as to the stratigraphical horizons from which the remains were obtained, and the possibility</page><page sequence="94">Prehistory 99 of disturbance of the beds, I hold the opinion that the geological age of the mandible and skull fragments is uncertain. It is disappoint? ing, after the failure to establish any considerable age for Oldoway man (of Homo sapiens type) that uncertain conditions of discovery should also force me to place Kanam and Kanjera man in a 'sus? pense account/ " For an answer to this criticism, see Leakey (1936a, pp. 155-156; 1936c). The osteological data collected by Bertholon and Chantre (1912, pp. 234, 239, 243) for Neolithic people of north Africa, and for the dolmen builders of that region, will be given in connection with archaeological data for north Africa. From the small amount of evidence relating to fossil man in Africa, a few examples have been chosen to illustrate the need for intensive and coordinated research in geology, archaeology, and paleontology. The existing osteological evidence is far too slender to support any theory of the origin of man in Africa, and divergent views respecting the phylogeny of the skeletons and fragments so far discovered indicate that much methodical excavation has to be done before we can support a hypothesis for the origin and genetic relationship of the divergent physical types now inhabiting Africa. These brief notes have touched only the most startling discoveries, and the aim has been to avoid details of measurement and description which can be derived from the works quoted. A student must realize firstly the paucity of data, then the equivocal nature of the evidence. It would be misleading, however, to give the impression that the literature on this subject is small, for though discoveries of major importance are few, excavation is always in progress, and recent publications of Galloway, Drennan (1935), Wells (1935a, b), Schepers (1935), and Goodwin and Malan (1935), are typical of present research which may at any time lead to a discovery of primary importance. Since the fossilized remains of man and his precursors are at present so inadequate as prehistorical evidence, we must turn to the facts of geology and archaeology in the hope of illuminating the dark pages of the Pleistocene. Stone Implements archaeological technique The successful work of Egyptologists, and the wide publicity given to their discoveries?often of a spectacular kind?has brought to archaeology a deep interest and romance. But success in the</page><page sequence="95">100 Source Book for African Anthropology reconstruction of Egyptian history has perhaps aroused too great optimism respecting possible application of the same technique in other parts of Africa. Systematic excavating has been done in Algeria, Kenya, and south Africa, but owing to the remoteness of the stone-age periods concerned, and the absence of writing, the precision of the Egyptol? ogist in giving not only sequences, but dates, can never be attained. The work of a professional archaeologist is a skilled occupation which should never be confused with the efforts of treasure hunters who have ruined sites by indiscriminate digging for the sake of amusement and publicity. Scientific excavating is a slow, system? atic process involving a survey of the ground by use of a theodolite and a plane-table. Not only should an archaeologist be a surveyor; he must in addition have a knowledge of geology and cartography. Trial pits and trenches are dug, and if an undisturbed stratification exists the excavator considers himself fortunate. Geological knowl? edge leads to an estimate of the relative ages of the deposits and the probable lapse of time required for the formation of each stratum, but the actual dating in terms of years is always hazardous. An excavator is particularly careful to ascertain whether the deposits have been disturbed either by man or by natural agency, for, if the strata have been mixed, objects such as pottery, stone implements, and human and animal bones which now lie together may not have been contemporary. It may be that objects have been washed from one stratum to another, and, if this possibility is not recognized, confusion and incorrect inferences are inevitable. Archaeology is becoming more and more the work of specialists. A zoologist or paleontologist may be asked to identify existing genera and species of wild or domesticated animals whose bones are dis? covered. Physical anthropologists report on human fossils, their sex, race, and antiquity. Potsherds, beads, and porcelain are arti? facts requiring special study, while dendrochronology (estimation of the age of timber from consideration of the rings) is again a recent and special development of technique. A botanist is asked to identify grains and plants, which he is sometimes able to do by microscopic examination of fragments of food in pottery vessels. Among the specialists are chemists and metallurgists, whose analyses are sought. In recent years the airplane has been used in archaeological surveys of the Zimbabwe ruins and the prehistoric sites on the oasis of Kharga in the Libyan Desert. In Egyptology astronomical observa</page><page sequence="96">Prehistory 101 tions have been important in relation to chronology. Thus, almost every branch of science has made some contribution to archaeology. The technique of excavating naturally depends on the nature of the site. An ancient cemetery may be divided into squares, each side of which measures twenty meters. Each of these large squares is then divided into five-meter squares, and plans of each square are drawn so that an excavator can record the exact position and level of each object that is found. Photographs of skeletons and other objects are made in situ, and the objects are numbered and stored, with samples of the matrix soil, in cabinets bearing the numbers of the squares and the level from which they were taken. The aim is to secure a permanent record of the site so that an accurate recon? struction on paper is possible after the excavations have been completed. In this way an archaeologist often obtains a sequence of cultures. In the lowest layers he may have found stone implements and pottery of a particular type, and these may be associated with human and animal remains of a specific kind, which do not occur in quite the same form and frequency in upper layers. Perhaps the higher levels yield more elaborate stone implements and more ornate pottery, and it may be that examination of human bones indicates that a racial intrusion modified the physical type of those whose bones were discovered in the lower strata. This digression concerning the method and function of archae? ology is necessary for the understanding of prehistoric problems of Africa, but it should be understood that very seldom does an archae? ologist have the opportunity of studying ideal stratifications, each of which contains all the kinds of evidence described above. Often he has to allow for distortion of strata and washing of objects from one level to another. More often than not, an excavator is handi? capped in his theories by paucity of evidence, so that wide scope for conjecture is left, and hypotheses are difficult to establish or refute. Or conflict may exist between the geological, osteological, and archaeological testimony. europe Some preliminary consideration of the European Pleistocene glaciations, fauna, types of implements, rock paintings, and remains of fossil man is necessary for understanding the terminology and discussions now current in similar African studies. Research workers in north Africa, Egypt, Kenya, and south Africa make comparative</page><page sequence="97">102 Source Book for African Anthropology studies of African and European stone implements for which the same terms, for example, Chellean, Acheulean, and Mousterian, are often used. In addition to this, stylistic affinities of European and African rock paintings and engravings are compared. In our survey of the archaeology of Africa only the main themes and the most important bibliographical items will be mentioned, but these references will lead farther afield, for each book and article has its own bibliography. In addition to the individuals mentioned, the following sources are of importance: Ebert (1924-32) has edited a "Reallexikon der Vorgeschichte." Much periodical literature exists in Revue Anthropologique, Revue Arch?ologique, Bulletins et M&amp;noires de la Soci?t? d'Anthropologie de Paris, L'Homme Pr^historique, M&amp;noires ? Tlnstitut d'Egypte, Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, and the publication of U Institut de Pal?ontologie Hum?ine. L'Anthropologie has an index Volume (1932), containing a list of contributors to the subject of European and African archae? ology. In the list of articles published by Abb? H. Breuil, and by Breuil in collaboration with Obermaief, Peyrony, and other archae? ologists, a student will have a reliable guide to the most important prehistoric problems of Europe, and many for Africa. In the pages of the South African Journal of Science, Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa, and Proceedings of the Rhodesian Science Association, are numerous archaeological reports which, taken alone, are inconclusive. Collated, as they must be in years to come, they will collectively explain many geological, archaeological, and osteological problems that are at present obscure. I feel sure, however, that a beginner will derive the greatest profit from a few textbooks before setting out on the task of summarizing periodical literature, which, for the main part, deals with specialized problems in a technical way. For studying European data many textbooks are available. W. J. Sollas (1924) begins his work "Ancient Hunters" with a descrip? tion of the great ice age in Europe and the way in which the climate of the whole world was affected by oscillations. Even on Mount Kenya near the equator the glaciers extended 5,400 feet lower than they do today. Similar evidence is afforded by other east African mountains, Ruwenzori and Kilimanjaro. The great ice age, and periodic changes of temperature during genial epochs between glaciations, profoundly affected flora, fauna, and the racial history of man. Sollas' study of the formation of glacial terraces (p. 22) by</page><page sequence="98">Prehistory 103 denudation and deposition is one which is intimately connected with the chronological sequence of types of implements found in these regions. "The great ebb and flow of temperature was at least four times repeated; four times have the glaciers enlarged their bounds, and four times have they been driven back into their mountain home (the Alps)." Useful notes on terminology are given (p. 118) when Sollas divides the Paleolithic series into two groups, an upper and a lower. In the Upper Paleolithic, starting from the most recent, are the Azilian, Magdalenian, Solutrean, and Aurignaeian. Then, at the top of the Lower Paleolithic is the Mousterian, and below that the Acheulean and Chellean, all of which terms, together with several others, are constantly used in the terminology of African archaeology. A student should be familiar with forms of implements of these periods, and in this connection the British Museum "Guide to the Antiquities of the Stone Age" (Read, 1911, 1926) will be found serviceable, for in addition to European types many African paleoliths are sketched. At the end of the Paleolithic periods occur the Azilian and Tardenoisian, which are transitional from the last period of the Paleolithic (Magdalenian) to the Neolithic, or age of polished stone, with accompanying evidence of pottery-making and domestication of animals. Consideration of the river terraces of the Somme (Sollas) should not be neglected, for early in the study of African paleoliths the importance of such eroded terraces will be seen when comparing relative ages of paleoliths discovered in the Nile Valley, and along the Zambezi. Sollas' maps (1915, Figs. 74,132) showing the geographical distribution of Mousterian and Aurignaeian settlements in Europe are of importance in relation to the study of archaeology in north Africa. Engravings of the mammoth, of reindeer, and of convention? alized human forms, should be carefully considered, since constant reference is made to these in literature bearing on African picto graphs. But a more extensive and clearer series of European Paleo? lithic art forms is given by Burkitt (1921), and a volume, "The Art of the Cave Dweller," is devoted to that subject (G. Baldwin Brown, 1928) ; Cartailhac and Breuil (1904) were among the first to publish excellent illustrations of paintings and engravings from the walls of caves in the Pyrenees, and a large tome of such mural art has been published by H. A. del Rio in conjunction with H. Breuil and R. L. Sierra (1911).</page><page sequence="99">104 Source Book for African Anthropology Burkitt (1921, pp. 33-60) has an extremely useful chapter describ? ing man in relation to geology in which he gives types of imple? ments that enable archaeologists to subdivide major Paleolithic periods into upper, middle, and lower sections; such nomenclature will be found in descriptions of African stone implements. Burkitt discusses paleontological evidence of climatic conditions and tabu? lates the lists of animal bones associated with arctic, steppe, and warm conditions. Burkitt (p. 23) states that "the question of the periodicity of the Ice Age, that is, of the recurrence of glacial and inter-glacial periods, has been a matter of heated controversy. There are those, chief of whom are Dr. Albrecht Penck and Dr. Hugo Obermaier, who affirm that there were four glaciations. Others, including M. Boule, are content with three, whilst others again, especially geologists in the north, claim that there was only one glacial period. As has been suggested it may be merely a question of latitude, and further north where the mean annual temperature is obviously lower, the inter-glacial period would necessarily be shorter and cooler.?These four glaciations have been named after four little rivers that flow from the northern slopes of the Alps: W?rm (the latest), Riss, Mindel, and G?nz. Between each of these periods there were warmer inter-glacial periods; these were the G?nz Mindel between the G?nz and the Mindel glaciations according to the Penckian scheme, then the Mindel-Riss between the Mindel and the Riss glaciations, and the Riss-W?rm between the Riss and the W?rm glaciations." Familiarity with these fundamentals of European geology is necessary for understanding the tentative schemes suggested by archaeologists working in east and south Africa. In connection with this preparatory study MacCurdy (1924) will be of great service. In archaeology, as in other new sciences, terminology grows rapidly, and this difficulty MacCurdy has met by providing a glossary of archaeological and paleontological terms. It should be noted that the word Capsian (Vaufrey, 1933) is the equivalent in northern Africa of the Upper Paleolithic period, named from Capsa, the Latin for Gafsa (Tunis). The word Levalloisean is sometimes used in African archaeology; the adjective is derived from European terminology used in describing a flint implement occurring in certain late Acheulean and early Mousterian deposits. Maglemosean is the Scandinavian equivalent of the Azilian. MacCurdy (1924, vol. 1, p. 27) provides a table of the "Chro? nology of Prehistory," which is more detailed than the tables previ</page><page sequence="100"></page><page sequence="101">106 Source Book for African Anthropology ously mentioned. Thus he divides the Neolithic, from more recent times backward, into Carnacian, Robenhausian, Campignian, Maglemosean, and Azilian-Tardenoisian. An account of the ice age and the types of Paleolithic implements found in Europe is followed by a well-illustrated section on Paleolithic art, and a summary is given of the discoveries of fossil man in Europe. north africa With this European terminology and an outline of European geological and archaeological data in mind, we may now turn to the systematic archaeology of north, east, and south Africa. Then we can consider the less developed investigations in west and central Africa, where surface finds, and not excavations, are the chief sources of archaeological information. Our studies may be centered about stone implements, rock paintings and engravings, and megalithic monuments. For terminology of north African archaeology see Leakey's comments (1936a, pp. 99-110). A useful starting point for the study of paleoliths of north Africa is C. G. Seligman's article (1921a, with bibliography) in which he describes his attempt "to obtain definite stratigraphic evidence as to the antiquity of implements exhibiting a technique which in Europe would be classed as Chellean, Acheulean or Mousterian." The sites visited were Abydos, Thebes, Tel-el-Amarna, Meir, and the Wady Sheikh. Seligman states (p. 117), "The implements themselves may be classified as follows, the 'period' given in the second column being that to which they would be assigned if they were of European origin. The hand-axe with borer point, crescents, and the tortoise point have no European parallels." Seligman's list includes hand-axes of Chellean and Acheulean form and finely worked ovates of Acheu? lean type; of Mousterian pattern are points, side-scrapers, borers, concave scrapers, tanged spear- and arrowheads. The forms desig? nated Mousterian are not specially typical of the Mousterian but are so grouped because of the localities in which they were found, stratigraphy, and patination. As Capsian or transitional to that type are mentioned concave end-scrapers, nose end-scrapers, and end-borers. "From a morphological standpoint the River-drift types are unmistakable. The Mousterian types, as far as the points, scrapers, and borers go, are equally typical and can be paralleled precisely by west European forms. A certain number of specimens cannot</page><page sequence="102"></page><page sequence="103">108 Source Book for African Anthropology readily be referred to either a Chelleo-Acheulean or Mousterian technique. If the west European forms be taken as standards, some of these would be regarded as Aurignacian of the coarser type." Seligman is inclined to regard some Egyptian forms as highly devel? oped Mousterian types that have been modified by Capsian influences from North Africa. The geological argument to show that some of Seligman's material is Pleistocene and Paleolithic is given (p. 136). In conclusion (p. 142) he states that, although the majority of the implements, River-drift, Mousterian, and Capsian, show a patina due to long exposure on the desert, there are implements of a highly developed Mousterian type which do not show the Paleolithic patina. These are found in situ in undisturbed gravels geologically of Pleistocene age. Some imple? ments of Mousterian type and a few of River-drift and Capsian pattern are not patinated. They resemble specimens found in un? disturbed gravels and appear to have been weathered out of the cliff in geologically recent time. The illustrations of paleoliths of the eastern Egyptian desert shown by Sterns (1917a) are useful for comparison with the types discussed by Seligman. Sterns' article is, however, mainly a cata? logue with notes on patination. After discussing the resemblance of Egyptian types to such European forms as the Chellean, Acheu lean, and Mousterian, he remarks that "type alone is no safe criterion for the correlation of specimens from widely separated areas. It has been clearly demonstrated that similarity of form does not necessarily mean proximity in time." When making comparative study of Paleolithic implements from Europe with similar types from north, east, and south Africa, typological resemblances alone will not suffice to establish contemporaneous development of similar industries in different areas. An archaeologist should be able to show that the fossils associated with each type are of the same period. In each of the areas under comparison the same types of implements should occur in the same sequence, and evidence of this kind ought to be obtained from the intervening area. Then the spread of a succession of cultures over the whole area, probably by human migrations, becomes a tenable hypothesis. In Egypt at Kharga, stratigraphy of Paleolithic discoveries is a subject to which Miss Caton-Thompson and Miss E. W. Gardner have contributed. Their report of 1933 refers to discovery of Neolithic implements of Faiyum type between the Kharga Oasis and the Nile Valley, and the oasis itself offered an opportunity</page><page sequence="104">Prehistory 109 of studying the stratigraphical succession of stone-age industries. A large number of specimens of a specialized Mousterian industry was obtained. Caton-Thompson's report (1932) examines the geo? logical evidence and shows a sequence in situ of Acheulean, Levalloisean, Middle Paleolithic (Pre-Sebilian), At?rian, Capso Tardenoisian, and Neolithic. The report of 1933 showed that the third season materially enlarged the evidence for greater vertical and horizontal distribution of the types of artifacts described in the report of 1932. When studying the geology of Egypt and the types of implements in relation to stratigraphy, three comprehensive reports (1929,1933, 1934) of the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago, are available under the authorship of K. S. Sandford, and of Sandford and Arkell in collaboration. In his foreword to the first volume (1929) Professor James H. Breasted emphasizes the need for continued geological work in the Nile Valley and points out that without the cooperation of geologists archaeology can make no substantial advance. The objects of the expeditions, therefore, were " to search the geological formations for imbedded human handiwork or other traces which would date in geological terms the earliest human occupations of the Nile Valley; and to follow such traces as far down toward the historic epoch as possible; and second, to investigate the geological background of prehistoric man in northeastern Africa, so that all natural formations containing human artifacts might be geologically dated and their genetic place in the geological sequence determined within as narrow limits as possible." There is no evidence of Pliocene man in Egypt but there is ample stratigraphical testimony of a succession of stone-age cultures throughout the Pleistocene. In this period, when rainfall was copious, Paleolithic man hunted along the banks of the Nile and over the surrounding hills and plateaus. Instead of dry wadies, there existed plentiful streams and the landscape was covered with vegetation. Of great interest to archaeologists are the terraces showing where the Nile flowed above its present level, and in many of these terraces, bordering both the main river and its one-time tributaries, are the artifacts of Pleistocene man. The succession of implements in the various terraces is briefly summarized (Sandford and Arkell, 1933, p. 86) and a map (p. xvii) showing localities of investigation is given. In the 100-foot terrace in Nubia and Upper Egypt, Chellean and Chellean-Acheulean implements have been found, but not in the</page><page sequence="105">110 Source Book for African Anthropology older beds, and again in the 50-foot terrace these forms occur. "The Mousterian technique reached an exceedingly high standard at the time of the 10-foot terrace, and the beautiful workmanship seen in the implements here figured (Plate XXXII) represents the typical Mousterian of Upper Egypt at its best." During the following period of silt accumulation, the previous high standard was not maintained, and almost imperceptibly the flakes became thicker and lost their fine edges and retouch. The shape also changed from a broad-based leaf to a rectangle or a point. To these changes in Mousterian forms the term Sebilian has been applied (Sandford and Arkell, 1933, Plate XLII; Vignard, 1923). "Distinct from the Lower or Middle Sebilian is the Upper Sebil? ian, which has essentially neanthropic character of workmanship, and suggests the introduction into this part of the Nile Valley of Capsian or Capsian-like influences from north Africa or elsewhere. The apparent hiatus between Middle and Upper Sebilian industries, reflected in their geological positions, suggests that some event of considerable importance to humanity took place at this time. At present there is insufficient evidence to judge what it was, but we suspect that the growth of deserts here and elsewhere had set in motion those migrations which continue at the present day among the desert population." In the third report, which is devoted to wider archaeological and geological surveys and a correlation of the results, the Lower Paleo? lithic stage of the Pleistocene is described (Sandford, 1934, pp. 53 65), then the Middle Paleolithic (pp. 66-80) and finally the transition to Late Paleolithic and Neolithic times. Bibliographically this volume is of great service in a survey of the contributions of A. Pitt-Rivers, C. G. Seligman, W. M. F. Petrie, J. de Morgan, E. Vignard, G. W. Murray, Miss E. W. Gardner, Miss G. Caton Thompson, H. Breuil, and Bovier-Lapierre. Seligman (1921a) is regarded by Sandford as the originator of modern work on prehistoric archaeology and stratigraphy in the Nile Valley, though half a century ago A. Pitt-Rivers (1881) found implements in situ at Thebes in gravels now recognized as of Mousterian age. With regard to the transition from Middle to Late Paleolithic times Sandford states (1934, p. 81) that Egyptian archaeology is in need of a term to describe the cultures that followed the Mousterian, or Middle Paleolithic, industry. "Upper Paleolithic" suggests the European, Aurignacian, Solutrean, and Magdalenian, none of which seems to be normally represented in Egypt, though Vignard has dis</page><page sequence="106">Prehistory 111 covered an industry which he considers to have Aurignacian affinities, and he associates the Upper Sebilian with the Tardenoisian industry. Sandford decides on using the term "Late" Paleolithic as corre? sponding to "Upper" in Europe, and to late Mousterian, Mousterio Capsian, and Capsian in north Africa. Sandford (1934, p. 81) refers to a gradation of implements which, in their earlier stages, may be grouped together as "Late Mous? terian and Early Sebilian," and this group merges into Middle Sebilian. The term Sebilian is derived from the village of Sebil on the Kom Ombo plain. The typology of the Upper Sebilian artifacts in flint and other hard rock is dominantly microlithic, with affinities to the Capsian culture. With regard to human bones associated with implements from Kau and Kom Ombo, Sandford (1934, p. 86) states that examination by Arthur Keith, D. E. Deny, and G. Elliot Smith indicates that the people whose bones were discovered were "more akin to the pre dynastic Egyptian than to any other race of which we have full knowledge." A summary of the stratigraphy of archaeological discoveries, which is given in tabular form (Sandford, 1934, p. 126), begins with primitive implements of Chellean and Chelleo-Acheulean types in the 100-foot terrace, and traces the refinement of these forms through the 50-foot and 30-foot terrace to the Egyptian Mousterian types of the 10- to 15-foot terrace of Upper Egypt and the 25-foot gravels of Middle Egypt. This Mousterian culture is then traced out in the silts and degradation gravels of Upper and Middle Egypt, through Lower, Middle, and Upper Sebilian, to the Neolithic period. For study of the Neolithic period in Egypt the following works are of importance: E. W. Gardner and G. Caton-Thompson (1926, 1933); Caton-Thompson (1927); Brunton and Caton-Thompson (1928); Reisner (1923); and (in German), Junker, who summarizes a considerable amount of periodical literature relating to Neolithic Egypt. G. Caton-Thompson (1926, p. 315), after completion of her inventory of the Faiyum culture, quotes the belief of Flinders Petrie that in studying the Faiyum culture we are dealing with the arti? facts of a people of Solutrean kinship and northeastern origin. Petrie postulates a trek of Solutrean people about 15,000 b.c. from perhaps the region of the Caucasus into the Nile Valley, bringing their advanced civilization with them. He believes the Faiyum and Badarian people are offshoots of these Solutreans. Miss Caton</page><page sequence="107">112 Source Book for African Anthropology Thompson regards the Faiyum culture as a late stage of Neolithic. "The Badarian is still more advanced; he makes beautiful fine pottery, uses copper, and employs glazes." The Badarians were of ordinary predynastic type with a slight Negroid admixture. Miss Caton-Thompson examines the Solutrean theory (pp. 316-318), but does not find support in typology, in distribution of the types of implements, or in geological stratification. The flint forms of the Faiyum industry extend to Siwa Oasis and to Kharga Oasis and "there is little doubt that when these oases are examined a similar general culture will be revealed." Caton-Thompson is certain (p. 322) that the Badarian, Faiyum, and Nubian groups have a common origin, and that this origin will prove to be an autochthonous proto-Libyan element whose ancestral home is yet to be discovered (for Neolithic Egyptian implements see Fig. 23, a, h-k). With the manufacture of pottery in Egypt and the association of sherds with Neolithic implements, a new branch of archaeological work opens up. An excellent approach to ceramics is given by Frankfort (1924) in a well-illustrated discussion of "Mesopotamia, Syria, and Egypt, and Their Earliest Interrelations," for which a large bibliography is provided. This work is indispensable for students who wish to begin their archaeological studies with the Neolithic period in north Africa, and such studies lead directly into the dynastic and datable period, circa 4000 b.c. With regard to Lower Paleolithic man in the region of what is now Morocco and Algeria, there is abundant evidence. Siret (1925) gives many illustrations of typical forms of coup de poing from Morocco, and of side-scrapers and end-scrapers from the same region. Notes on stratigraphy are wanting, and the objects appear to be surface finds that have weathered out from their original gravels. Further information on Paleolithic north Africa is given by Arambourg (1934) and by Zoli (1935). The two journals, Memoire, Archives de V Institut de Pal?ontologie Humaine, and Bollettino della Reale Societ? Geografica Italiana, in which these articles respectively occur, are two valuable sources of information. The latter often supplies data about a part of north Africa where research is now conducted by Italians. When, however, we approach the study of Middle and Upper Paleolithic discoveries in northwest Africa there is abundant evidence of stratification and a succession of types; these are related at least morphologically to European Mousterian and Aurignacian patterns. Burkitt (1921, p. 106) says: "Nor is the profound alteration in</page><page sequence="108"></page><page sequence="109">114 Source Book for African Anthropology industries the only change that we find when we come to Upper Paleolithic times. Man himself has changed; we have to do with a new race far more elevated in the scale." Burkitt agrees with the hypothesis that when Neanderthal man disappeared in Europe his place was taken by a true Homo sapiens, the Cro-Magnon race, which probably came from north Africa. Of the Aurignacian (Capsian, or Getulian) stone culture in north Africa, Vaufrey (1933) has recently written a well-illustrated article showing many types of Capsian points, and he has provided a map on which are plotted stations of Upper Paleolithic culture near the north African littoral from 10? W. Long, to 10? E. Long. In summarizing the data relating to the Capsian industry, Vaufrey (p. 480) distinguishes three chronological groups: namely, (1) Cap sien typique; (2) Interg?tulio-n?olithique and Capsien sup^rieur; and (3) N^olithique de tradition capsienne. For all of these types, he provides numerous illustrations. The third stage shows a develop? ment of microliths, and the intrusion of arrow points of Saharan type is to be noted. To the third phase of the Capsian also belong polished axes and pottery sherds (Fig. 23, 6, c, l-n). Despite the difference of types, the industries of the Capsian form a homogeneous block, the climax of which is reached in the fine microlithic points of trapezoidal and triangular form. From the typological point of view, the Capsian appears to Vaufrey as an industry of Mesolithic or perhaps final African Paleolithic character, and he deprecates any attempt to make this Capsian industry the ancestor of the Aurignacian in Europe, to which culture the Capsian is probably junior. According to Vaufrey (1933, p. 481), the geological evidence is not favorable to views demanding antiquity for the Capsian. "Where should we search for ancestral forms of the Capsian?" he asks, and states that typologically certain Sebilian forms from Kom Ombo in Egypt may be the prototypes. But though such affiliations of types exist in Tunisia and Kom Ombo, all the facts are in favor of a late introduction of this Upper Paleolithic industry into Africa, and the archaeological data are unfavorable to a hypothesis that describes Africa as the home of Homo sapiens. A brief summary of features of the Capsian culture may be obtained from Menghin (1931, pp. 177-188) who marks out four primary divisions: (1) A Mediterranean division that flourished in north Africa when the climate was moist and game was plentiful; (2) a European Capsian or Tardenoisian; (3) an east African; and</page><page sequence="110">Prehistory 115 (4) a south African Capsian culture. Later, in dealing with the archaeological literature for east and south Africa, we shall be better able to judge the legitimacy of applying the term Capsian so widely. Menghin (1931, p. 48) recognizes two main divisions of the Neo? lithic age in north Africa. The older of these cultures is found in caves of Oran where Capsian implements occur together with arrow points of Neolithic form and crude pottery. In the younger division of the north African "Grotten Kultur," the Capsian type of imple? ment disappears and improved sherds of pottery are found. These Neolithic cultures exist in the southern and central parts of the western Sahara, where stone implements indicate the spread of a hunting culture from the north, and an agricultural culture from the south. The former contributed arrowheads and javelin points, while the latter culture gave axes and grinding stones. In pursuing further these north African studies, Collie (1928) will be of service in describing the European Aurignacian period and its alleged African parallels. The report deals chiefly with European geology, archaeology, and fossil man, but references to north African problems are numerous. Changes of climate in north Africa are discussed (p. 16), and the chapter on fauna of the Aurig? nacian age is a simple summary of paleontological facts showing that Aurignacian man had access to abundant animal life. Mechta man is described (p. 18) and Collie describes the first bearers of Aurignacian culture in Africa as a breed possibly of Mousterian and Negroid or some other parentage. Of the male skeleton from the Mechta site (Constantine, Algeria), Collie says, "The skull has very strongly developed and prominent supraorbital ridges which are not individualized but extend as a bar across the forehead. The head is dolichocephalic but not platycephalic; viewed from above the skull is pentagonal. The nose is flat, the eye orbits small. In respect to the brow ridges both the male and female skulls are Neanderthaloid, but the total resemblance is not close?yet on the other hand these people are not Cro-Magnons. They are an inter? mediate group and it seems best to classify them apart under the title of Mechta man or the Mechta race." Collie recognizes the need for caution in making any final pro? nouncement on fossilized human bones from Mechta, but (p. 29) he thinks that several types of people moved over the north African plateau in the Aurignacian period, but none of them were of the true Cro-Magnon type that is associated with the European Aurig</page><page sequence="111">116 Source Book for African Anthropology nacian culture. Collie, supporting his views with testimony from Breuil and Obermaier, leans toward an African origin of the European Aurignacian culture and is inclined to agree that a pre-Aurignacian, or pre-Capsian, race seems to have come from Africa. According to hypothesis this race, which was not Neanderthaloid but approached the Homo sapiens type, entered southern Spain during the Chellean Mousterian ages bearing a new-stone culture, which combined with the stone culture then in Europe to produce a culture that we now call Aurignacian. But caution is again necessary, for we have already seen (Vaufrey, 1933) a discussion of the Capsian cultures and a reluctance to accept them as a parental form of the European Aurig? nacian. Still less did Vaufrey favor the idea that north Africa had given birth to a new Homo sapiens. Collie continues to discuss the various views that have been held respecting types of Cro-Magnon men in Europe and the possibility that the types survive, with admixtures, at the present day (pp. 30-35). Information respecting the remains of prehistoric man in north Africa has been summarized by Bertholon and Chantre (1912, vol. 1, pp. 234-243), who find that Neolithic people in the region of Gafsa and Tebessa had small bones and a feeble muscular develop? ment. They were of medium height, long-headed, and mesorrhine. The orbits were microseme, the face was short and broad with a tendency to prognathism, and the cranial sutures were simple. Two main types are distinguishable: (1) a mesaticephalic Negroid type; and (2) a short, dolichocephalic, mesorrhine type, with a large glabella and a Neanderthaloid aspect. The fossil skull and skeleton from Asselar, 220 miles northeast of Timbuktu, has been discussed by Leakey (1936a, p. 177), who summarizes the evidence of Boyle and Vallois. Probably the skele? ton is a representative of the ancestral Negro stock of central Africa. Hooton (1925, pp. 192-207) discusses the relation of the Guanches and other ancient inhabitants of the Canary Islands to the so-called "Race of Cro-Magnon," and supports a belief in the hybrid character of the Cro-Magnons. In his introduction to anthropometric research on the Cap-Blanc skeleton of the Upper Paleolithic, G. von Bonin (1935) surveys the literature bearing on physical characters of the Upper Paleolithic populations of Europe. He asks (p. 18), "Are they really racially homogeneous or do they represent several dis? tinct races? Can they be traced in subsequent or perhaps even in modern races?" His answers to these questions (p. 51) are non? committal, but in view of his personal research and that of colleagues</page><page sequence="112">Prehistory 117 the opinion is offered that "there is no statistical reason to regard the Upper Paleolithic as racially mixed." In answer to the second question, there is the possibility of an occasional manifestation of Cro-Magnon characters among modern populations. "But such observations might be explained equally well on another ground but that of atavism." Since the Canary Islands may be regarded as the most westerly extension of north Africa, there is reason to search there for soma tological, linguistic, and cultural evidence of north African migra? tions that traveled westward to the utmost limit. The nearest of the islands is about sixty miles from the African coast. Hooton (1925, pp. 298-303) has given a "Tentative Reconstruction of the Prehistory of the Canary Islands." He believes that the first settle? ment of the archipelago probably occurred in the Neolithic period with the arrival of dolichocephalic, mesorrhine, short-statured brunets of Mediterranean race with some Negroid mixture. "These settlers probably came from the mainland of Africa south of Morocco or from the region of Wadi Draa. They brought with them domesti? cated sheep and goats, a chipped-stone and bone industry, but they probably had no knowledge of cultivated cereals and did not make pottery. They may have spoken some proto-Berber language." The second invaders were brunet whites with some Mongoloid features whose center of distribution in north Africa was the Gulf of Gabes and eastern Tunisia. "They introduced into the Canary Islands the cultivation of barley, the use of crude and usually unornamented pottery, the sling and pellet. This brachycephalic group survived in its purest cultural form in Gomera?these people mixed with the Mediterranean-Negroid carriers of the Archaic culture, in Gran Canaria, Teneriffe, and Gomera." Almost contemporary in arrival with the Alpine-Mongoloids were a tall, blond, dolichocephalic people, with long faces and narrow noses. Before arrival in the Canary Islands, these invaders had a strong admixture of the Alpine-Mongoloid type. These third invaders, who came from the Atlas ranges of Morocco and Algeria, formed a ruling caste. They probably spoke an early Libyan language. Mixture of these third arrivals with the broad-faced brachycephals of the second incursion produced a hybrid type with a long head and a broad face, often of large stature and probably of light pigmenta? tion, with brown, red, or blond hair. "This is the so-called Cro Magnon type."</page><page sequence="113">118 Source Book for African Anthropology A fourth invasion affected chiefly the eastern islands, and to existing peoples were added dolichocephalic, leptorrhine brunets of the Mediterranean type. The people of the fourth invasion intro? duced much better and more elaborate ceramic forms distinguished by decoration in color. The intruders understood the cultivation of wheat, and they used pottery stamps for making designs on their bodies. A brief survey of the region of north Africa from the Canary Islands to Egypt has indicated that a sequence of stone-age periods can be traced backward from the Neolithic through culture phases that in broad outline resemble the Mousterian, Acheulean, and Chellean phases of Europe. From study of implements in the Nile Valley terraces, the Paleolithic age is known to recede far into the Pleistocene. Yet cultural changes did not always merge one into another, and in the Nile Delta region there is evidence of a new stone-age culture imposed from without by people of unknown origin. The Canary Islands also afford an illustration of superimposed cultures contributed by a succession of peoples of different physical types. These immigrants traveled westward from the Atlas region, and study of skeletal remains in the western terminus of their migration indicates the presence of four main somatic types with their derivatives produced by mixture. Concerning the origin of these types, their exact line of migration, and their phylogenetic relation? ship to other African and European types, great uncertainty exists, and although a sequence of cultures is established, we have only the vaguest knowledge of the actual time intervals involved. Yet the evidence from north Africa indicates a definite advance in archaeo? logical research, and we may say that at least the foundations of a sound technique have been established. A table of Leakey (1936a, p. 114) is a useful summary of north African stone-age sequences. east africa In appraising the present position of archaeological work in east Africa, reference should first be made to Leakey (1931, pp. 1-4), who summarizes the archaeological data for Kenya, Uganda, and Tan? ganyika before the year 1926, and despite recent criticisms this is still our best source of information. Before that date no detailed archaeological investigations had been carried out in Kenya, but surface implements had been found and some stone tools had been discovered in situ. Distinct phases of culture had been recognized, but sequences had not been established. To this period of study belong the discoveries of Seton-Karr (1909), who found at Jalelo,</page><page sequence="114">Prehistory 119 about ninety miles northwest of Berbera in Somaliland, a site where stone implements were manufactured. The collection included heavy Paleolithic forms, coup de poing of quartzite and chert from high ground, also Neolithic lanceheads, arrowheads, and scrapers from lower ground where flint occurred. For Paleolithic types of implements, see Fig. 21. But Leakey states that, despite the paucity of archaeological data from east Africa before 1926, E. J. Wayland had established a scientific basis of research in Uganda. Wayland's research had included the collection of stone implements of various periods and cultures, and he had produced evidence of three main culture groups which he called Kafuan, Sangoan, and Magosian. Wayland had anticipated present research by advancing the idea of a glacial pluvial correlation as a foundation for studying the sequence of east African stone-age cultures. These preliminary researches led to the formation of an East African Archaeological Expedition, which in 1926 started work in Kenya, where investigations were concentrated on the lake basins of Nakuru, Elmenteita, and Naivasha. Here Leakey found evidence of three pluvial periods, separated from each other by arid periods. The vision of archaeological research was widened, and the objectives included not only the establishment of cultural, geological, climatic, and paleontological sequence, but the correlation of these with corresponding changes and phenomena in Europe, north Africa, and south Africa. Leakey (1931, p. 38) gives a list of terms applied to culture sequences in Kenya. Beginning with the most recent, these are: Njoroan, Gumban B (Nakuru culture), Gumban A, Kenya Wilton, Elmenteitan, Kenya Late Aurignacian and Kenya Still Bay (con? temporary), Kenya Aurignacian and Kenya Mousterian (contempo? rary), Nanyukian, Kenya Acheulean, and Kenya Chellean. Leakey then describes the typology of the cultures and the geological and paleontological evidence on which the arrangement is based. A table giving the hypothetical synchronizing of culture phases with wet and dry climatic phases is given by Leakey (1931, p. 33). A more detailed tabulation is offered by the same author (1934d, p. 146), and a revised table (1935, p. 6). The latest table given by Leakey (1936a, p. 75) shows an evolution of types of implements from the Kafuan or primitive pebble culture to the Njoran or Neolithic. This later tabulation works upward from the extremely simple Kafuan culture through the Oldowan to Chellean I, all of which are</page><page sequence="115">120 Source Book for African Anthropology Lower Pleistocene, corresponding to the European Chellean and pre-Chellean periods. On the left of the table is an indication of climatic changes in Europe during the advance from Kafuan to Chellean I. The scheme further shows that during the Middle Pleistocene a cultural advance was made from Chellean II to Acheu lean V in east Africa, corresponding with similar culture periods in Europe during the Mindel and Riss glaciations. At the bottom of the Upper Pleistocene, the scheme shows Acheu lean VI, Nanyukian, and other phases leading up through Basal Aurignacian to Aurignacian and Levalloisian. In the upper part of the Upper Pleistocene are the Upper Aurignacian and Kenya Still Bay cultures. The Elmenteitan and Magosian cultures are the uppermost of the Upper Pleistocene cultures. The Elmenteitan has replaced the Kenya Aurignacian and the Kenya Still Bay has changed to the Magosian. The climatic changes during this cultural evolu? tion in Kenya have been described by Brooks (Leakey, 1931, Ap? pendix B), who shows a parallelism between glacial periods in Europe and pluvial periods in east Africa. The most recent pluvial period, tlie Nakuran, he dates 850 b.c.; before this came a dry period. The Makalian pluvial is thought to have occurred from 10,000 to 2500 b.c., and before the Makalian came a dry period. The Upper Gam blian pluvial of east Africa possibly synchronized with the W?rm glacial period in Europe, and the Lower Gamblian was contemporary with the Riss Glacial. A dry period in east Africa preceding the Lower Gamblian is correlated with the Mindel-Riss inter-glacial of Europe. And the most ancient pluvial, the Kamasian of east Africa, was contemporary with the Mindel glacial and the G?nz glacial periods of Europe. Brooks (1931, Appendix B) believes that this tentative scheme of synchrony has a high degree of probability. For continuing the study of archaeology, geology, and climatic change in east Africa, the contributions of E. J. Wayland (1930,1934), of Wayland and M. C. Burkitt (1932), and of O'Brien (1936) are of primary importance. Taking these in chronological order, Wayland (1930, p. 475) states that the facts, as we know them in Uganda, favor belief in the occurrence of two pluvial periods in the Pleistocene. So far as dating goes, these appear to correspond with a pair of recognized glacial periods; Pluvial 1 was to some extent contempo? raneous with the G?nz and Mindel glaciations, while Pluvial 2 was approximately contemporaneous with the Riss and W?rm glaci? ations. The pluvials were separated by a dry interpluvial period? all the evidence favors the view that these two pluvial periods</page><page sequence="116">Prehistory 121 were true pluvials because they occurred at the same time over wide areas of the earth's surface. In continuing this inquiry, Wayland (1934) gives a historical sur? vey of archaeological and geological research in Uganda, and he provides a table giving further geological and climatic details of the pluvial periods and cultural phases in Uganda. A summary of archaeological types and sequences (p. 351) indicates that the pebble culture, which had possibly started in Late Pliocene time, developed slowly. "During Part I of the second pluvial period, though not at the beginning of it, Man began to use lumps of quartzite from which to fashion his tools; he soon became expert in cleaving his tough rock, and before long enormous flakes were being detached. Pebbles were not completely abandoned, however, and for some purposes they are used to this day. In Karamoja (N. E. Uganda), for example, the blacksmiths use hammer stones; and boulders, brought to an edge, provide a sort of anvil for shaping spears." Following the Kafuan "pebble" culture came a pre-Chellean phase of stone artifacts, some of which are Clactonian in technique. "The Chelleo-Acheulean and Sangoan cultures developed side by side, the former being a culture of the valleys and the latter of the hills." Present information suggests that the Sangoan developed into the Mousterian culture. The Homa evidence, which cannot be accepted as final, suggests that the local Mousterian developed into the Still Bay culture. "The Aurignacian appears to have been a foreign influence which came, presumably, from the north, or more likely north-east, for in that direction Aurignacian sites are commonest?indeed, they would seem to be decidedly rare elsewhere in Uganda. From the Aurignacian arose microlithic industries such as the Magosian and Wilton. In the Magosian a dying Still Bay influence is apparent." In Uganda no pottery is definitely known until the Wilton culture appears. But Leakey (1931, p. 103) states: "The question of the existence of pottery in Palaeolithic times has always been a vexed one, but there can be no doubt whatever of the presence of two pieces of pottery in the upper Kenya Aurignacian deposits in Gamble's Cave II." A student should, however, be very cautious in making deductions from this small amount of evidence. The Magosian culture in Uganda has formed the subject of an article by Wayland and Burkitt (1932), who describe and illustrate these artifacts in detail, classifying them according to the levels at</page><page sequence="117">122 Source Book for African Anthropology which they were found and commenting on their resemblance to the products of the Wilton industry in south Africa. A valuable r?sum? of archaeological work in Uganda has been prepared by O'Brien (1936). He begins with the oldest culture, namely, the Kafuan; this he describes as a "pebble" culture which in every particular is "the most primitive recognizable in Africa," and definitely prior to the Oldowan of Leakey. In the Kafuan industry, the flaking of the pebbles was merely a reduction of the natural edges to produce small cutting and chopping tools. These Kafuan tools mainly occur in terrace gravels deposited by rivers of the first pluvial phase. Younger gravels yield evidence of early Oldowan types, the type tool of the true Oldowan being a crude chopper. Following a European nomenclature, O'Brien describes the Cro merian culture characterized by the striking of large, crude flakes. The evidence implies that this Uganda Cromerian culture belongs to the interpluvial phase, and that the culture continued into Pluvial II (Kamasian) times, as part of the Sangoan mixture of types. "The true Chellean does not occur widely in Uganda. There appear to be several stages, however, which seem to conform to the normal succes? sion as seen in other parts of Africa." A worker of the Chellean culture carried out his chipping with the intention of producing two edges and perhaps a point. This technique is in contrast to the earlier single-edged chipping of the Kafuan-Oldowan cultures. Definite stages from the Chellean to the Acheulean have not yet been discovered in Uganda. For many years the Tumbian culture has been known in both the French and the Belgian Congo, and it is found also in Uganda. At present we do not know whether the Tumbian development was a lateral branch of the Acheulean, or whether the Acheulean at an advanced stage borrowed features of a Tumbian culture already existing in the Congo. The Levalloisian culture appears between Lower Acheulean and Upper Acheulean, and finally develops into the Still Bay phase. The important features of the Levalloisian culture are its longevity and wide distribution over Uganda. Possibly the lack of a Uganda Aurignacian culture in any way comparable to the Aurignacian of Kenya may be due to the rarity of suitable material. The Magosian culture is Mesolithic. The Neolithic culture of Uganda is a "widespread industry of microlithic type, without polished tools, occurring abundantly in caves and</page><page sequence="118">Prehistory 123 shelters, and in the open. The tools include lunates, minute tapering backed-blades, and small scrapers. Pottery is always associated, at any rate in home sites, and is always well-made." The Neolithic industry is late, perhaps only a few centuries old. For a criticism of O'Brien, see Wayland (1937). south africa The history of archaeological work in south Africa is in outline a repetition of the development of technique in the north and east of the continent. The literature may be conveniently grouped in four divisions: (1) discoveries of stone implements, chiefly surface finds of the period 1870-90; (2) early attempts to study typology, sequences of patterns, and stratification; (3) specialized articles dealing exclusively with one small site or one type of implement; and (4) recent articles and books summarizing the foregoing contributions, welding the information, and advancing theories respecting the relationship of stone-age cultures of north, east, and south Africa. J. Sanderson (1878) called attention to current tales of the Kafirs relating to a stone-using people who preceded them, and he notes the continued use of stone as weights for digging-sticks, hammers, and grinders. Sanderson states that the first scientific interest in stone implements from Natal may be dated about 1871. The imple? ments described by Sanderson are referred to as knives for cutting skins, scrapers for preparing skins, piercers of quartz for drilling holes, molding tools for making pottery, and chisels for cutting wood. Some of the implements were found near Durban from one to four feet below the surface, but on the evidence of W. D. Gooch (quoted by Sanderson) some of these forms were shown to have a very wide distribution. A few years after the publication of Sanderson's article, Gooch (1881) placed the study of stone implements on a scientific basis by taking cognizance of types of implements, their topographical dis? tribution, the character of the deposits in which they were found, and the nature of the material from which they were made. The topographical scheme of Gooch included the division of south Africa into districts "which the apparent grouping of types or forms of the implements found in them seemed to suggest." Various Paleolithic forms are illustrated, and the article concludes with a table giving a description of implements, geological position, and district where found. To this inaugural period also belong the contributions of Feilden (1883), Penning (1886), and Leith, Frames, and Penning, all of</page><page sequence="119">124 Source Book for African Anthropology whom wrote in 1898. Leith deals with cave deposits, shell mounds, and coarse stone implements, among which are eoliths traceable to high gravels. Leith sees a close typological correspondence between stone implements from the chalk of Kent and those from plateau gravels in the Transvaal. T. Rupert Jones (1899) described thirteen large paleoliths from Swaziland. He remarks on the impossibility of suggesting a chronology for these implements, for the relative ages of the gravels in which they were found are undetermined. It was known, however, that the implements were found in gravel terraces of different ages cut out by the River Embabaan. The illustrations show a large ovate form and two long, narrow specimens. Kingston (1900) explored some caves on the coast between Mossel Bay and Port Elizabeth. The excavation was not thorough, but the author states that "we arrived, by a series of soundings in various places, at a very fair idea of the nature of the deposits and even of the manner of life of the former inhabitants." The objects found included long, narrow implements of flaked quartzite, arrowheads of stone, a bone scoop, a shell ornament, pounders, and heavy perforated stones. The caves had been occupied at different levels by Strand loopers. Some stone implements found in the valley of the Zambezi were described by Lamplugh (1906) and by Balfour in the same year. The implements were lying on the bottom of the broad outer valley, and their occurrence in the high gravels assigns to them a great antiquity. With one exception the implements were discovered at the surface, and a geological section (p. 164) is given to show the position of the artifact which was found in situ at a depth of five feet. Lamplugh concludes that most of the implements, which are rude paleoliths, were left in their present position when the Zambezi flowed in the higher valley for some distance below the present falls. Balfour (1906) describes a Paleolithic type of implement from the Victoria Falls region. In type he compares this implement to those of the River-drift (Chellean) period in northeast Europe. The implement, though found on a road which was under construction, was traceable in origin to a sand pit near-by. The sand pit was in an ancient deposit of coarse gravels, laid when the river was running at a height perhaps 15 to 20 feet above its present level at this point. The site, patination, and abraded surface of the implement point to great antiquity, and the resemblance in type to some European River-drift implements led Balfour to remark that "the combined evidence seems to point strongly to a strict correspondence of con</page><page sequence="120">Prehistory 125 ditions in the two widely separated regions, to a like condition of culture, in both cases of great antiquity. Whether it is legitimate to assign to these Zambezi implements as remote a date as that given on geological evidence to the implements of our own River drift must be determined by further examination of the older Zam? bezi deposits." (For south African Paleoliths, see Fig. 22, b-d.) The publication of P?ringuey's (1911) dissertation on the stone ages of south Africa marked the beginning of a really intensive study of south African archaeology. Moreover, there is a definite expan? sion of speculation respecting analogies of types from south Africa and Europe. Referring to coarse, heavy paleoliths, P&amp;inguey (p. 8) says of the south African forms: "The Chellean type is the Chellean form of the Palearctic regions. This is indubitable. But the types that might correspond with the Aurignacian, Solutrean, and Magdalenian cultures, especially the last, have an indescribable facies of their own which may be said to be South African. On the other hand the pygmy implements, and others with the bord abattu of the French, cannot be very readily distinguished from the English, French, and Indian implements of the same type, except, of course, by the material of which they are made; but they more closely approximate the Algerian and Morocco examples." After a brief review of European typology Peringuey (p. 17) begins his survey of the different types of south African Paleolithic implements and states that he has no difficulty in dividing the bouchers into several types, owing to their appearance or facies, or to the material of which they are made. He then describes the manufacture and probable uses of the bouchers. The geological evidence for establishing the relative antiquity of implements is said to be inadequate. The survey includes an account of a Neolithic period, though the term is perhaps not justified, and some description is given of pottery, ornaments, and craniology of the Strandloopers, all with a view to summarizing the information available in the year 1911. But it is evident that the prehistorical studies are a long way from presenting a relevant and connected story of physical types, their succession, wanderings, and achievements. Among articles of importance dealing with special sites and specific types of implements are the following: N. Jones (1920) describes the evidence for four successive periods of prehistoric occupation at Taungs. From the earliest period are water-worn hand-axes of all shapes and degrees of workmanship; then, more recent, are some flakes and scrapers of diorite which are not water</page><page sequence="121">126 Source Book for African Anthropology worn. A still more recent period produced specialized implements of chert with a careful secondary chipping. A final period is charac? terized by the presence of implements and chips produced by Bush? men. A stratification of stone cultures at Tiger Kloof is also considered in this article. Further examples of local studies are those by N. Jones (1924, 1930), Gardner (1928), Goodwin (1929), and Armstrong (1931). N. Jones (1924) states that the country between Bulawayo and the Zambezi River is particularly rich in stone implements, chiefly hand-axes, "strikingly similar to those of Chellean and Acheulean age in Europe." Similar types of early Paleoliths are found abun? dantly in British Bechuanaland. In addition to the river gravel implements, the Later Paleolithic is represented in Rhodesia by implements discovered in caves of the Matopo Hills and in super? ficial deposits. These flake-implements with Aurignacian facies are regarded as the work of Bushmen. But between the remote period known as the River-drift, and the Aurignacian period, there is a gap which is yet without an archaeological bridge. The peculiar interest of the Sawmills site, situated fifty-five miles northwest of Bulawayo, lies in the fact that "we have here two distinct periods of human activity, an older and a newer, both clearly separable by geological methods." The article gives illustrations of stone implements from the older terrace, of "fabricators," of cres centic scrapers, and of microliths. The later implements as a whole show clear resemblance to Aurignacian forms of Europe, but such evidence does not permit the assumption that the Bushmen who fashioned these implements were of the race responsible for an Aurig? nacian culture in Europe. Possibly the Bushman derived his knowl? edge of stonecraft from an earlier race, "but so far as present research has carried us in South Africa, we are here in the realm of pure conjecture." Father Gardner's article (1928), with numerous illustrations, gives a clear idea of the typology of the Wilton stone-age industry, which includes a variety of scrapers and crescents. N. Jones (1930) also describes a particular phase of stone-age culture, the rostro carinate, a term borrowed from Reid Moir's nomenclature for some late Pliocene and early Pleistocene implements of East Anglia. Jones (p. 73) states, "The occurrence of this primitive form of implement is of special interest in that it points strongly to the identity of the race that evolved it both in Europe and South Africa." This is, however, a strong statement, which will, I think, have to be</page><page sequence="122">Prehistory 127 regarded with great mistrust. Jones continues to describe the se? quence of implements from the site where the rostro-carinate imple? ments were found, at Hope Fountain, Rhodesia. He regards the Hope Fountain industry as a developing series extending from the Chellean to the early Acheulean. Armstrong's (1931) description of excavations in a Bambata cave emphasizes a development in archaeological technique, and the opening remarks indicate a broad outlook on the possible inter? relation of European and south African archaeological problems. Bambata Cave in the Matopo Hills south of Bulawayo contains deposits and a frieze of wall paintings (p. 240). "Two sections were systematically excavated to the bed-rock of the cave, a maximum depth of 20 feet 3 inches, and yielded a complete sequence of deposits varying from Lower Paleolithic (South African Acheulean), to a Microlithic culture [Fig. 22, e-j), believed to be ancestral to the Wilton culture of the Cape. The succession of cultures was found to be in close agreement with the European sequence." A careful investigation was made into the nature and age of alluvial deposits near Bambata Cave, and the artifacts of these deposits were used as a standard for correlating the deposits with definite stages in the occupation of Bambata Cave. "Implements from the Lower Palaeo? lithic horizon of Bambata Cave were correlated with those collected in numerous Rhodesian river valleys." The Zambezi gravels south of Victoria Falls were visited and evidence was obtained relative to the distribution of the Lower Paleolithic series of implements found there. The relation of these implements to stages in the erosion of the Zambezi gorge was studied. Armstrong (p. 248) cautions against a free use of European archaeological terms unless these are modified by prefixing the words "south African." One should be careful also not to assume that similar artifacts from Europe and south Africa are contemporaneous. In conclusion (p. 273), Armstrong states that the excavation of Bam? bata Cave has given the first south African example of a stratified sequence of cultures from Acheulean to Wilton; the latter is the African cultural equivalent of the European Tardenoisian. An important result of the work in Bambata Cave was the evi? dence of long occupation of the cave by Mousterian man, the entry of Homo sapiens, and the fact that these two races occupied the cave alternately, each preserving a pure culture. This discovery agrees with that of Leakey, whose excavation in certain Kenya gravels led him to conclude that the two races were contemporary there. With</page><page sequence="123">128 Source Book for African Anthropology regard to this statement, a student should be warned that the evi? dence for the occupation of Bambata by two races, Mousterian and Homo sapiens, is cultural and not osteological. The further conclu? sions of Armstrong will be quoted verbatim later in this chapter, since they are of importance in our summing up of the cultural relationship of stone-age man in north, east, and south Africa, and in Europe. The research of Armstrong has brought our inquiry to a point where a selection of recent literature (1927-32) should be made in order to continue the discussion of cultural sequences in south Africa and their possible external relationships. Goodwin (1927) refers to a new school of archaeological thought in south Africa, and a tendency of this school to take over the Euro? pean terminology, sequence, and even dating. "The result has been chaotic." Goodwin then outlines a scheme of classification, typology, and cultural sequence which has been adopted as a working basis by the South African Association for the Advancement of Science. It is extremely important that a student should memorize this scheme, since all discussions make use of the terminology. Two main divisions are recognized for south Africa, the earlier stone age and the later stone age. The earlier period lasted thousands of years, and the period ended possibly three thousand years ago, though precise dating is quite impossible. Dr. P&amp;rnguey's term, Stellen? bosch, for the main culture of the earlier stone age has been retained. The main types of this culture are coups de poing of well-known forms, oval, almond-shaped, pear-shaped. A second culture of the earlier stone age is the Victoria West, and a third the Fauresmith. Following the earlier stone age, and probably overlapping, is a later stone age, of which the first industry is the Still Bay, somewhat similar to the Solutrean of Europe, with pressure technique produc? ing a lanceolate implement about two inches long. The Still Bay was followed by the Smithfield and Wilton cultures, which were probably contemporary and may have extended into modern times. The Smithfield culture consists mainly of duckbill-shaped end-scrapers, and with these are associated other forms of scraper, stone borers, bored stones, ostrich-eggshell beads, stone rings (armlets), pottery, also human bones. The Smithfield industry is similar to the Lower Capsian or Lower Aurignacian. The human bones are of that general type known as "Bushman." For a tabular statement of these south African culture sequences, see Leakey (1936a, p. 97). This table is Leakey's personal interpretation of the data.</page><page sequence="124">Prehistory 129 The chief implements of the Wilton industry are the lunate crescent, end-scraper, horseshoe scraper, and thumb-nail scraper, and with these are associated pottery similar to that of the Smith field culture, bone implements (Fig. 23, d-g), Bushman skeletal remains, and cave paintings. All evidence considered, the Wilton culture is identical with the last phases of the Capsian of Spain and north Africa, in which implements were all of the pygmy variety. The Wilton industry survived to the year 1870 at Kimberley. In conjunction with Goodwin's summary of the classification of stone cultures in south Africa, his "Handbook to the Collection of Stone Implements in the South African Museum" (1926) should be read. On page 24 appears a diagram illustrating the possible origins and interrelations of the stone-age cultures of Europe, north Africa, and south Africa. This guide summarizes the stone-age cultures of Europe and pictures Aurignacian man starting from the east and arriving at the Mediterranean Sea. There the migration split in two, one part following the northern shore while the other part continued along the north coast of Africa. "The northern branch took with them the true Aurignacian culture, which was to oust the lower culture of the less advanced Neanderthal race. The African branch carried the Capsian culture which was later to pass across Africa and from there into Italy and Spain across the great land bridges which split up the Mediterranean Sea into three or four separate areas." Furthermore (p. 8), Goodwin pictures the culture of Capsian man of north Africa, and draws inferences of his physical appearance from paintings in the caves of Spain. In connection with the Capsian culture, Goodwin notes the introduction of the bow and arrow into Europe, the clothing of men and women, the physical trait of steato pygy (large buttocks), the beginning of ceramics, and the piercing of large stones to serve as weights for digging sticks. "We now know that our own south African Bushfoik are culturally the same as these long-dead north Africans who spread into Southern Europe. Whether or not they are physically the same is so far impossible to say. His culture, however, can be traced in east Africa and Uganda, and reappears in the Union over the whole of the central portion. The technique of the 'Bushman' paintings is identical with the technique of Spain, the materials used are the same, the same attitudes are seen, and the same disposition to depict action rather than objects." These brief articles by Goodwin serve as an introduction to a comprehensive work by Goodwin and C. van Riet Lowe (1929), who</page><page sequence="125">130 Source Book for African Anthropology survey the whole classification of implements in south Africa from the Stellenbosch industry through all the periods mentioned by Goodwin (1926, 1927) to the Wilton and some Neolithic elements. For a brief summary, with appreciation and criticism of this work, Menghin (1933, pp. 370-371) should be consulted. A detailed summary of the prehistory of south Africa is Lebzelter's (1930) "Vorgeschichte von S?d- und S?dwestafrika." A geographical survey of sites is made and information is given concerning types of implements, their topographical distribution, and chronological succession. The work is amply illustrated with plates and text figures. Our digest has now advanced from a period of preliminary observation, through an experimental stage of classification and speculation to evolution of a definite technique of excavation, strati? fication, and typology, thence to the wider hypotheses relating to the genetic relationship of cultures widely separated geographically. This broader archaeological view requires further discussion, since these hypotheses of wide outlook are the ultimate aim of many workers, whose separate observations and minor excavations are of little importance if left without coordination. Armstrong (1931, p. 274) makes generalizations that agree well with those of Goodwin: "The excavations [Bambata Cave] have also revealed the effect of fusion between elements of Mousterian culture and the Capsian culture of the Neanthropic immigrants, and the discoveries have indicated the possible origin, and line of evolution of the European Solutrean technique. Striking evidence has been obtained for the correlation of the early Rhodesian cave art with the culture of the Neanthropic immigrants, which, together with the Capsian character of the associated culture, establishes an important link with the Aurignacian culture of Europe and supports the evidence in favour of a common origin for the two cultures in the Capsian of North Africa. "In the light of the evidence, together with that derived from Mr. Leakey's discoveries in East Africa, I am inclined to the opinion that Homo sapiens evolved the Capsian culture in the region of the Sahara Desert, and that the increasing aridity and ultimate drying up of that region supplied the impulse which drove him out in suc? cessive bands, northwards into Europe and south-east, by way of the Rift Valley and Great Lakes of Eastern Africa, into Rhodesia and beyond. There he apparently found a population of Mousterian</page><page sequence="126">Prehistory 131 culture and probably of a Neanderthaloid stock, over which, after an interval of dual occupation of the country, the new-comers became dominant. Possibly there was a fusion of blood, but there is clear evidence of a strong cultural fusion." Armstrong further points out similarity between the Wilton microlithic culture and that which is so widespread over east and north Africa. Both find expression in the European Tardenoisian, and these similarities imply a migratory movement from a center in northern Africa. The evidence for this migration in Africa from north to south is very strong; the route followed is that for the earlier spread of the Capsian. The discovery in the Bambata excavations of the presence of a pygmy burin in this Wilton culture, and its confirmation on almost every site visited, is an important one which establishes a closer link with the European pygmy cultures. A presidential address by Lowe (1930) is a valuable contribu? tion to our present summary of the development of archaeological work in south Africa. The address passed from historical develop? ment of archaeological interests to a choice of nomenclature. The need for caution in using such terms as Chellean was impressed, and the value of a south African terminology was defended. The speaker expressed the opinion that "the big problem in south Africa is the correlation of cultural and human remains, first with each other, and then with the various Pleistocene Pluviations and earth movements. Then the big problem for all prehistorians will centre largely on the Glacio-Pluvial correlation, for, until this is solved, it is impossible for us to recognize relative time horizons." The work of Leakey and Solomon in east Africa was referred to as "a great link in a great chain." Lowe (p. 104) expressed the opinion that paleanthropic man reached and inhabited Europe. He urged further study of geology and climatology, and the more numerous and thorough excavation of such sites as caves and rock shelters, river terraces, and raised beaches. In a somewhat later address (1932) he again justifies the departure from European archaeological nomenclature, but he recognizes resemblances between south African and European forms, and he tabulates the main divisions of the Lower Paleolithic cultures in south Africa with their European type equivalents. In completing a study of the three major regions of Africa where systematic archaeology has advanced appreciably, the generaliza? tions of Leakey (1931, pp. 238-239) should be read. He repeats the hypothesis with which we are already familiar: namely, that of a westward migration of Aurignacian man from Asia. On two main</page><page sequence="127">132 Source Book for African Anthropology lines the immigrants advanced, the one into western Europe by Palestine and the Caucasus, the other through Arabia into east Africa about the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, thence via Somaliland into the Sudan and north Africa. This hypothesis would account for the fact that the Aurignacians in Kenya are so much earlier than in north Africa or in Europe. There is, however, a rival hypothesis favoring the origin of the Aurignacians in the southeast Sahara. Professor M. C. Burkitt (Wayland and Burkitt, 1932, p. 378) demonstrates that the Magosian culture of Uganda has affinities with the Wilton and Still Bay cultures of south Africa. In both east and south Africa (p. 379) a cross-fertilization of cultures resulted from contacts of middle-stone-age people and the later Neanthropic arrivals. Burkitt suggests that the area now known as Uganda may have been the cradle of that modification of Neanthropic man who developed the Wilton industries of south Africa. The consensus of opinion favors cultural and also racial migrations from north Africa into southern Europe, and down the east side of Africa into the southern part of the continent. For a comparative table of all African stone-age cultures, see Leakey (1936a, p. 136). Consult also page 188 for discussion of the part played by diffusion and parallel? ism in determining cultural resemblances. Leakey accounts for resemblances of Solutrean, Aterian, and Still Bay cultures on the grounds of "parallel evolution," and he explains the various miero lithic cultures of Africa in the same way. Yet the truth often lies in allowing for a combination of the two processes. the congo region and west africa Archaeological work in these areas is definitely less developed than in the three regions, north, east, and south Africa, for which the data have been summarized. In fact, one may say that so far as stone implements are concerned the archaeological outlook for central and west Africa is in the primary stage of observation. The period of systematic excavation, and the formation of hypotheses respecting the internal sequence and outside relationships of the Congo and west African stone-age cultures, have not yet been attained. In 1899, Stainier published in the "Annales du Muse? du Congo Beige" a brief report on stone implements of the Congo, where the first specimens appear to have been found in 1885, and in 1891 a stone-age station was discovered by M. J. Cornet near Katanga. Since that time numerous specimens have been unearthed at localities</page><page sequence="128">Prehistory 133 shown on Stainier's map. These localities are peripheral about the main Congo River and its affluents, and no stations are marked within the heart of the forest region. This may be due to absence of excavations in the densely wooded interior; naturally the greater number of discoveries were made in making railways and roads in the more accessible outer regions. Yet it may be that stone-age invaders did not reach the internal forest regions. Stainier (p. 13) is unable to date the objects with any certitude, but it is probable that they are Neolithic; some of them are indubit? ably so, as, for example, polished axes and arrow-points. But side by side with the neoliths are paleoliths of the same material and of Chellean form. Tradition is absent, and the temporal relationship of stone to iron is unknown, but iron and copper are abundant; therefore, transition from the use of stone to metals may have been rapid. Menghin (1925, p. 518) has prepared a bibliography of con? tributions to archaeology of the Congo from the year 1887, together with a list of the types of implements found, their provenience, and the institutions where they are deposited. In Menghin's compendium, "Weltgeschichte der Steinzeit," indexed references to the Congo stone age will be found under the word "Tumbien." Rakowski (1921) reports on a collection of Neolithic stone imple? ments from the Welle region of the Congo, now deposited in the Belgian Colonial Museum at Tervueren. A list (p. 155) details the provenience of these implements, and a map showing the sites is given. "Only four of the forty-six specimens have been found in the earth, all the others having been collected on the surface. Of these four specimens three happen unluckily to have been found by natives, who discovered them in the beds of small rivers, or embedded in the banks of dry water courses. One specimen only has been found in situ by a white man, No. 34, from Lubumbashi on the Upper Luapula. It was extracted from alluvial drift 13 feet below the surface." The majority of the implements are made of hematite iron ore; some are of greenstone (diabase), and others of a bright greenish rock, much weathered. The specimens may be divided typologically into seven categories which are illustrated by outline drawings. A short bibliography (p. 64) is appended. A collection of stone implements from the Congo, now in the Trocadero, Paris, has been described by Breuil and Kelley (1936). Apart from Menghin's speculation (1925, p. 553) regarding the possibility that the Tumbakultur in the lower Congo and west</page><page sequence="129">134 Source Book for African Anthropology Africa is part of the Graebnerian Kulturkreis, we have no theories of the origin of the Congo stone age. Archaeological work for this region is not much more advanced than that of south Africa fifty years ago. In west Africa the position of prehistoric archaeology, though backward, is more advanced than in the Congo region. Some of the principal discoveries of archaeological interest for west Africa have been summarized by Hambly (1935, pp. 379-388) who gives a short bibliography. Desplagnes (1907, pp. 22-38) describes workshop sites where stone implements were made in various localities notably near to Lotokoro and Gao. The types of instruments, varying from crude coups de poing to various burins, scrapers, and arrowheads (Des? plagnes, Plate XV), indicate that the technique ranges from rough Paleolithic forms to small Neolithic instruments of quartzite. Some typically Neolithic stations are distinguished by the presence of fragments of iron and abundance of well-ornamented pottery frag? ments. Desplagnes asks (p. 29) whether invaders from the north brought a knowledge of iron to primitive Niger fishermen of the stone age; such a suggestion is favored by the different types of tombs that may be seen near the workshops. Undoubtedly the age of stone persisted for a long time and was prolonged into the iron age. In tumuli of the Niger region under discussion are weapons of copper and of iron together with Neolithic stone implements (Desplagnes, Plates XVI-XVIII). A range of archaeological observations of this kind, showing a sequence of cultures, is definitely in advance of our knowledge of the Congo stone age. But for the main part, west African imple? ments are surface finds, usually celts, though Braunholtz (1926) has described both Paleolithic and Neolithic implements from Nigeria. To this list Balfour (1934a) adds a note on "cleavers" of Lower Paleolithic type. This is a pattern dominant in south Africa south of the Zambezi, and the further dispersal of this "cleaver" in Africa is of interest. Polished celts and their ceremonial use at the present day have been described by Dwyer (1903), and by Balfour (1903). Dwyer states that celts are connected with the reverence of the Yoruba for the Thunder God, Shango, who is said to use such stones as messengers. The antiquity of polished stone celts is discussed by Rattray (1923, pp. 322-331). Although the stones are of a sacred character</page><page sequence="130">Prehistory 135 because of their association with Nyame, the Sky god, from whom they are supposed to have originated, many people know that the stones are of human manufacture, and that some of them were employed recently. Rattray is of the opinion that "transition from the Neolithic to the iron age was not sudden. The stone implement [Fig. 22, a] and the iron one that was eventually to oust it must have been for a time used side by side in forest and field." Meek (1925, vol. 1, pp. 51-56) notes a variety of paleoliths in west Africa gener? ally, and a few roughly flaked types of implements which might be regarded as being of early-stone-age type have been found in the Northern Provinces of Nigeria. Meek gives a list of early stone implements discovered in the tin mines of the Bauchi Plateau. Some of these are of the Paleolithic "river drift" type of Europe, and some could be described as Mousterian in form. A list of polished celts, arrowheads, and scrapers from Naraguta is given (p. 51). Meek remarks that primitive Africa probably passed directly from the stone age to the iron age, but R?timeyer (1911) shows that stone and bone are used at the present day. He mentions a bone-pointed spear of the Shilluk, and a stone-headed club of the Ja-luo. Stone hammers, anvils, and grain pounders are today extensively used. In Cameroons, Migeod (1925, pp. 252-258) found polished stone axes and some paleoliths between Victoria and Yola. The imple? ments are classified by Migeod as Paleolithic-rough-hacked, Paleolithic-flaked, and Neolithic. Since the stones were not associ? ated with stratified beds, but were merely covered by a thin layer of soil resting either on granite rocks or on Eocene sandstone, the geo? logical formation does not aid inquiry into the antiquity of the implements. With further reference to the Neolithic age in Came? roons, Fourneau (1935, pp. 67-83) gives information respecting mate? rials used, sizes and shapes of the implements. Laforgue (1931, p. 463) attempts to classify prehistoric zones of west Africa into three main sites in each of which some distinguishing industry predomi? nates. The main zones are (1) Saharienne, which extends north of the 18th parallel; (2) Sahelienne, between 14? and 18? N. Lat.; (3) Soudanaise. Laforgue details what he considers to be the distinguishing types of artifacts for each of these regions, and con? cludes by pointing out the fact that most of the implements dis? covered in west Africa are without geological information. The obvious need is for systematic excavation of numerous sites with a view to determining stratification and the relative ages of the various types of implements. Prehistoric pottery has not been</page><page sequence="131">136 Source Book for African Anthropology carefully studied, though Laforgue states that in Zone 2 pottery is abundant and often artistic. Rattray (1927a, pp. 295-301) describes prehistoric pottery of Ashanti, which differs radically from that made today. Some of the ancient, highly ornate pottery was found with celts, and Rattray inclines to the view that this early pottery was made by unknown people to whom the present Ashanti were strangers. This pottery has been further discussed by Wild (1934b, pp. 203-215), who notes the occurrence of the pottery with stone celts of several forms, but no associated human bones have been dis? covered. Information is inadequate for dating the pottery, but certain historical considerations suggest that makers of the coarse red ware were carrying on their craft in the seventeenth century. A vast amount of skilled and organized research is necessary to bring the archaeology of west Africa to the level of attainment reached in the north, east, and south of the continent. The need is for more systematic excavation in many areas, together with accurate geological surveys, the two being an essential step toward the co? ordination of west African archaeological discoveries with those in other parts of the continent. Apart from the question of stone implements, their types, dis? tribution, and chronology, west Africa has some minor archaeological puzzles, though these have no known connection with the stone age. Curious statuettes of stone and clay from Sherbro Island and Liberia have been described by Neel (1913a, pp. 419-443). According to Joyce (1905), no information is available respecting the makers of nomori figurines such as are used by the Mende of Sierra Leone. Such statuettes are placed under small shelters in the fields and offerings of food are made to them, or the figurines may be chastised to make them comply with the wishes of their owner. Constant tribal incursions into this region where nomori figures are now found, but not made, might account for the rapid disappearance of the art of making them. The soft stone of the figurines wears quickly; therefore, the abrasions and weathered appearance may erroneously suggest antiquity. Addison (1934) provides excellent illustrations of nomori, and he explains that in Mende nu or no means a person and mori or moli means to ask a question. Nomori may contain good or bad spirits who will answer questions and fulfill requests. Approach to the nomori is usually made through a medicine-man. Terra cotta heads and the priesthood associated with them at If6, Nigeria, have been photographed by Hambly (1935, Plates CLIV, CLVI, CLVII), who summarizes (pp. 466-468) some of the views</page><page sequence="132">Prehistory 137 respecting a possible Carthaginian or Egyptian origin of a craft which is unique. Other illustrations of these objects may be seen in Frobenius (1913, vol. 1, Plates VI, IX). These nomori of Sierra Leone, and terra cotta heads of If6, with stone monuments of that region, cannot yet be shown as part of a general archaeological problem. And in west Africa, as well as in other parts of the con? tinent, are stone structures of unknown origin and age which will have to be considered later. Rock Paintings and Engravings Literature bearing on the regions of Africa in which stone imple? ments have been found should now be searched for evidence of artistic expression. The association of works of art with types of stone implements should be noted, and the testimony of paintings and engravings should be added to the other evidence bearing on migrations of lithic culture and of stone-age races. Examples of prehistoric art can be conveniently considered in northern, eastern, and southern divisions, though there are no clear geographical lines of demarcation between the northern and the eastern examples. The territory where rock sculptures and paintings are found extends from Algeria to Libya, through Nubia and Kordofan into Tangan? yika Territory and south Africa (for comparison of styles, see Fig. 24). As with the study of stone implements, we have in connection with primitive art a period of preliminary observation resulting in notes and short articles that evince a growing interest in the subject. The observations become extended geographically and the sites are more thoroughly described. Finally, there is an attempt to unify pictorial with other archaeological evidence, and hypotheses respect? ing the migrations of early cultures are formed. north africa Barth (1857, vol. 1, pp. 197-200) portrays rock engravings in the Wadi Telisaghe near Murzuk, where sandstone blocks were covered with drawings "made with a firm and steady hand, well accustomed to such work, and cut to a great depth." A sculpture (p. 197) represents a group of three individuals of the following character and arrangement. To the left is a tall human figure with a long, narrow, horned head. I could not agree with Barth that this is the head of a bull; the tapering head is more like that of an antelope. This anthropomorphic person carries a bow and arrow in the left hand. On the right of the picture is a similar individual, and between them a horned animal. Barth observes that the sculpture has nothing</page><page sequence="133">138 Source Book for African Anthropology of a Roman character but some particulars call to mind the Egyptian sculptures, or again the sculpture may have been executed by some one who had been in contact with a civilized people, possibly the Carthaginians. Barth does not suggest that the sculptures may be due solely to the genius of a primitive people. Bates (1914, p. 94) gives the most feasible explanation of this petroglyph as a hunting scene in which the two males are disguised with the head skins of animals so that they may approach close to their quarry. Barth remarks on the absence of the camel from the sculptures, and the fact that at the time the sculptures were made oxen were used for transport in that region. Other sculptures show the ostrich and the buffalo. These examples given by Barth are of great importance in further comparative study of prehistoric art in Africa. The technique of engraving, and above all the distinctive style show undeniable affinities with a phase of art, examples of which have been observed in southern Spain, north Africa, Kordofan and south Africa. Among early papers on the subject of rock engravings, Gautier (1904) should be consulted with regard to pictures from Zenaga. The antiquity of the drawings representing elephants, ostriches, and the extinct Bubalus antiquus is uncertain. These animals per? sisted until Carthaginian and Roman times, and the engravings are not necessarily extremely ancient, yet in the opinion of Gautier they are probably the work of prehistoric, stone-age man. For a summary of what is known of the north African Pleistocene animals, consult A. S. Romer (1928). A southwesterly extension of the art of rock engraving is noted by Desplagnes (1907, pp. 77-84) in the French Sudan, but many designs are painted, not sculptured, and they appear to belong to a late Libyan-Berber and Tuareg class of inscriptions. To this class of inscriptions belong the examples discussed by Bates (1914, pp. 73-85, 160) and by Bertholon and Chantre (1912, vol. 2, pp. 503-518). Both works make a comparative study of Libyan, Punic, and Tamashek symbols. Bates (p. 85) states that no inscription in Libyan characters has yet proved older than about 400 b.c. The early observers are agreed that on stylistic ground alone the engravings such as those recorded by Barth are sui generis, and despite our ignorance of origins and chronology two classifications can be made: (1) rock engravings of animals, probably made by prehistoric, stone-age man to represent the game he followed; and (2) relatively recent engravings of camels, together with Libyan and</page><page sequence="134"></page><page sequence="135">140 Source Book for African Anthropology Tifinagh symbols. Excellent examples of the second class are given by Zeltner (1913, pp. 171-184). He points out that the evident use of a sharp engraving tool of stone for making incised drawings does not assure the antiquity of the sketches. Some of the drawings, which were clearly made with a sharp stone point, include designs of camels and of a man clad in trousers. At an early stage in the observation of designs, Zeltner (1911, pp. 11, 12) remarks that those he illustrates from the French Sudan, though in some superficial details homologous to European and Algerian works, are completely separate from these in their general character. Zeltner summarizes the nature of the Sudanese cave paintings. These are always at easily accessible altitudes near the entrances to caves. The colors used are specified in detail, and Zeltner is convinced that the paintings were made by the artist's fingers. Geometric ornament dominates, and realistic representa? tions are few. Conventional representations of men and of animals recall the rock engravings of Hadjra-Mektouba in the Sahara, and of Egypt. The early work of Zeltner makes clear that further study will have to be strictly typological and technological. Schools of art have included incised sculptures, often on exposed rocks, and paintings in caves. Of the relative chronology of these, nothing defi? nite is known, but the changes of style and type suggest the work of different peoples and separate periods. The name of Flamand is prominent among students of rock sculptures of north Africa. A brief account of his views may be found in a short article (1914) describing two new sites of engraved rocks in south Algeria. The principal engravings belong to the prehistoric period, and among these the most notable are an antelope (bubale), a lion, and an ostrich. This paper is, however, only an introduction to a comprehensive work (1921) which is the most help? ful survey yet published. The author divides his thesis into five parts, the first of which is historical from about the year a.d. 1800. He then deals with techniques of prehistoric, Libyo-Berber, and recent engravings. The distribution of sites is discussed, and a separate section is devoted to pre-Libyan (Neolithic), and to Libyo-Berber and Mohammedan engravings, respectively. The illustrations, indexing, and discussion make the work preeminent. The collection of Saharan rock engravings and paintings (Fro benius and Obermaier, 1925) shows a great advance in the technique of publishing the rock engravings and paintings, many of which are reproduced in their natural colors. For the main part, these rock</page><page sequence="136">Prehistory 141 engravings are of the Barth type, including excellent representations of horned cattle, ostriches, antelope, hyenas, lions, elephants, and wild asses, which show true affinity with some south African examples both in style and the subjects chosen, as well as in the technique of engraving. The text accompanying the pictures describes the phases of stone-age culture in north Africa. But there does not appear to be sufficient evidence to associate each of these phases with some specific form of art. The evidence produced is in the nature of a general comparison of the Paleolithic art of southern Spain and the art of north Africa, which on stylistic grounds is reasonably assumed to be the work of stone-age hunters. Ober maier (p. 41) speaks of the necessity for grouping these north African rock pictures according to their styles and periods of production. He recognizes three main styles: (1) the realistic portrayal of animals; (2) a combination of this art with use of conventional forms whose meaning is not clear; (3) more modern Libyan and Tuareg art, with etchings sometimes superimposed on the old-stone age engravings. During the past five years a new impetus has been given to the study of prehistoric art in north Africa by Monod (1932), Reygasse (1932, 1935), Passemard and Saint-Floris (1935), and Perret (1936). For further examples of African art, Frobenius (1930-31) and Breuil (1931) should be consulted. Selecting the more recent of Reygasse's publications, we have some excellent illustrations of the realistic school of prehistoric art from Tassiii des Ajjers, situated west of the Tripolitanian frontier between Ghadames and Ghat. With the pictorial records of Rey? gasse should be compared those of Perret (1936) from the same region. Reygasse states that owing to the impossibility of associ? ating stone-age material with the engravings, which are exposed on rocks situated on high hills, a scheme of chronology for the works of art is at present impossible; neither can they be synchronized with similar works of art from prehistoric Europe. Yet these sculptures, in common with all rock engravings and paintings in the Sahara, fall into two main categories. On the one hand we have the ancient engravings, and in contrast to these the more recent Libyo Berber art characterized by decadence of style and the appearance of the camel, which was not used in the Sahara until about a.d. 200. Reygasse, moreover, distinguishes two clear divisions in the art of Tassiii des Ajjers. Firstly, there is the art of a primitive population of hunters and food-gatherers, and, secondly, there is the art of the</page><page sequence="137">142 Source Book for African Anthropology first pastoralists. The basis of this classification is the study of different patinations of superimposed drawings, consideration of techniques, of the fauna, and lastly of costume and ornament. The art of the earlier period is readily distinguished by the presence of such tropical animals as the hippopotamus, rhinoceros, elephant, giraffe, antelope (bubale), Bovidae, and ostrich, which flourished before profound climatic changes took place. The drawings of the first pastoral people depict horses, oxen, and goats. The paintings, which are always in rock shelters, all belong to a pastoral age, and in association with some of these are Neolithic stone implements. Reygasse accepts the stylistic affinities of north African art of the old type with that of southern Spain and south Africa, and no observer who compares the drawings from these areas can fail to agree that resemblances are fundamental. That such analogies could arise de novo in separate centers seems impossible, and the argument for migrations of cultures and peoples is considerably strengthened by consideration of these works of art from the Sahara. For critical notes on the views of Reygasse, see "Nature," vol. 39, 1937, pp. 432-435. Beyond providing additional examples of the Bushman type of art, which are excellent, especially in the portrayal of human figures, Passemard and Saint-Floris (1935) have not attempted to solve stylistic and chronological problems. These observers have, how? ever, extended the geographical scope of observation by their careful records from Ennedi in the northeastern part of Chad Colony. In this region Tilho (1920) made some preliminary observations. The rock drawing he shows from the oasis of Yarda in Borku is of a somewhat recent type, with camels as the principal motif. Two papers dealing with the work of classification of styles, chronology of styles, and resemblances between art forms in north Africa and Europe have been published by E. S. Thomas (1926) and by K?hn (1927). The former sets out to make a study of drawings from ancient Egypt, Libya, and the south Spanish caves, and he has summarized his results by tabulating a large number of drawings in parallel columns. The designs are geometrical, together with conventionalized forms of human beings and animals. The pictures are assembled from many localities and from the works of various observers (p. 387), and a series of notes on the more impressive resemblances is offered. K?hn opens his synthetic article by observing that the most urgent question connected with research into Paleolithic art is that</page><page sequence="138">Prehistory 143 of assigning dates to the north African pictures of the Sahara-Atlas region. The reasons for ascribing pictures to a Paleolithic or to a Neolithic age are analyzed (pp. 14-16), and the characteristics of the old- and new-stone-age patterns as given by K?hn agree well with those we have just quoted from Reygasse. The evolution of style, the animals represented, the patination, the weathering of the incisions, the associated implements, and the introduction of figures of domestic animals, all aid in separating the older Paleolithic art from the Neolithic. K?hn (p. 25) calls attention particularly to the resemblance between his illustrations (Nos. 15, 18) from Tiout and those of the Paleolithic period of cave art in France and Spain. Finally he gives a comparative series of drawings of animals from prehistoric Egypt, from the Sahara-Atlas region, and from French and Spanish sources, which support his argument for a widely diffused and specific form of Paleolithic art. libya and kordofan Our r?sum? must now make a geographical excursion into Libya where several observers of the past decade have copied rock engrav? ings. Newbold (1924, p. 64) portrays pictures of animals and human beings which he found incised on rock surfaces at Zolat el Hammad. Some of the engraved figures are indeterminable, but others clearly represent tailed and phallic men, elephants, giraffes, ostriches, oryx, and cattle. Newbold notes a distinction between the pictures of several sites of the region, namely, the presence or absence of engravings of camels. This is a factor which aids in determining the age of the pictures. Newbold is of the opinion that the drawings he saw were the work of southern Libyans known as Tamahu, who formed the ruling caste in Ethiopia about 300 b.c. The age of the drawings is at least 2,000 years, and may be as much as 4,500 years, since the Tamahu ranged over the Dongola and Haifa deserts as far back as 2500 b.c. The drawings are crude, and the style does not suggest close technical relationship with those north African rock pictures we compared with Bushman art. Some of the sketches (p. 76, Plate VII) are, however, a little suggestive of Bush? man style. A steatopygous human figure appears, and tailed human beings are shooting with bows and arrows. These pictures from the rocks at Gelti urn Tasawir in Jebel Tageru might, I think, safely be classified with those we have previously relegated to a hunting stage of culture in the Paleolithic period. Taking Newbold's pictures as a whole, they could perhaps, with further study, be grouped as (1) Paleolithic, (2) early historical, dealing with a Libyan culture of</page><page sequence="139">144 Source Book for African Anthropology 500 b.c. and earlier, (3) the camel period from a.d. 200 onward. Newbold (1928, p. 263) impresses the difficulty of assigning dates to rock engravings in the Libyan Desert, since rock pictures and stone implements are surface finds, but he turns to Ptolemy and other geographical and historical sources to show the extension of a population of Garamantes, Mazices, and Nubae over wide territory now uninhabitable. Between one and three thousand years ago, there was much movement both vertical and lateral, in the Libyan Desert, and many oases now described as "lost" sheltered a popu? lation. So much is ascertainable from a study of place names in the writings of Egyptians, Romans, Greeks, and Arabs. From the data supplied by Newbold, we must learn to forget the present inaccessi? bility of desert regions when forming hypotheses of the migrations of peoples. The brief description of rock engravings at Ouenat given by Hassanein Bey (1924, pp. 353-366; 1925, pp. 203-205), and by King (1925, pp. 326-336) for other parts of Libya, should be supple? mented by Newbold's more detailed description (1928, p. 286). Newbold believes that, generally speaking, the pictures of Ouenat belong to the pre-camel era, and (quoting Abb? Breuil) he indicates that the Ouenat series may be divided into several groups with a time sequence. Realistic ostriches and giraffes probably belong to the Upper Paleolithic age, and these are of the same style as the best Bushman drawings in South Africa. Among the other and more modern rock pictures of Ouenat, the incision of outline and the "pecking out" processes, both of which were used by rock engravers in south Africa, are distinguishable. Newbold remarks in conclusion that "until we can find associated and stratified implements or other remains on a rock-picture site, the chronology must remain vague." He offers a suggestion of four categories of Libyan rock pictures: (1) Bushman type, Late Paleolithic or Early Neolithic; (2) Early Libyan, Neolithic, predynastic, and Old Egyptian Empire; (3) Middle Libyan, Middle and Late Empire, down to the introduction of camels into the Sudan; (4) Roman, medieval, and modern. Among recent representations of ancient art from Ouenat north? east of Kufra are those described and illustrated in color by Murphy (1934, pp. 796-799) and by Calzoni (1933). These rock paintings were discovered by a Hungarian explorer, Count Almasy, whose contribution brings us closely in touch with Bushman styles at their best, and their technique supports the view of Newbold that Ouenat provides in general an example of the art of old-stone-age hunters.</page><page sequence="140">Prehistory 145 Parker and Burkitt (1932) show rock engravings from Nubia, west of the Nile. Figures of ostriches and cattle are included, but the camel is the dominant design. At a place in Kordofan, 145 miles west-southwest of Omdurman, H. A. MacMichael (1909) made records of rock paintings, including designs of men on horseback, hyenas, and giraffes, some of which have a technique resembling that of Insalah in the northern Sahara. But this technique from Kordofan is not particularly like that of the Bushmen. A. E. Robinson (1934) introduces his pictures from Kordofan and Meroe by summarizing the different techniques. A petroglyph means a picture incised, pecked, or made by percussion on the rock, whereas a petrograph is a drawing made with charcoal or pigment. Graffiti (scratches) are included with petroglyphs. As a rule, petrographs are found in caves or rock shelters, but petro? glyphs are more frequently carved on exposed rocks. Some of the figures shown are Egyptian petroglyphs of the historic period, but several percussion types of petroglyph from southern Egypt and the Sudan show the ostrich, the elephant, and the giraffe very crudely represented. Judging by style alone, these latter could belong either to a formative or to a degenerate period of the Paleolithic school. southeast africa The rock paintings of Tanganyika Territory form a geographical, and probably a definite cultural link also, between Bushman rock art of south Africa and pictures of the same style and technique in north Africa. Nash (1929) discovered rock paintings of reddish color near Kondoa Irangi. Some of the drawings are merely outlines, but others have been filled in with pigment. "Most of the work is very crude and unfinished, yet in places quite skilful, especially where animals have been depicted, and that the artists were close observers of nature is shown by the perfect stance and curves which they gave, in particular, to the giraffes." Culwick's (1931b) pictures, painted in white, on the slabs of rock shelters near Bahi, Tanganyika Territory, have a legendary history showing that the paintings were made by men who lived, according to Culwick's genealogy, about 250 years ago. Therefore, the art is of a date too recent to be considered with any examples hitherto discussed. But the ritual, past and present, that Culwick describes in connection with these paintings is of the utmost importance, and it may well be that we have today a glimpse of the magical background that was an incentive to the Paleolithic art of south Europe and north Africa. The paintings function in ceremonies of prayer and sacrifice for producing rain.</page><page sequence="141">146 Source Book for African Anthropology The study of rock paintings in Tanganyika is continued by Cul wick (1931b), who points out that peculiar objects of stone, not obtainable elsewhere in the neighborhood, were abundant in the shelters where the paintings occurred. The paintings from Singida and other sites cannot be placed in one group, and the chronology of the different styles is uncertain. But in the discussion which followed the reading of the paper, attention was drawn by Culwick and Burkitt to "a close resemblance in style and technique, between many of the Uongero paintings and those of Rhodesia and south Africa, presumed to be of Bushman origin." My own opinion is that the paintings of animals (Culwick, Plates L-LIII) have in their realism and stance a very impressive resemblance to those forms of so-called Bushman art that we have assembled from north Africa. In type, the paintings are of the school of action and realism which K?hn, Reygasse, and others have classed as Paleolithic. For further information on rock paintings of Tanganyika, see Arundell (1936). south africa In reviewing the literature relating to rock engravings and paint? ings of south Africa, two points of primary interest are comparison of the works of art inter se with a view to establishing a chronology of style, and study of the petrographs and petroglyphs in relation to stone implements of various cultural levels, in the caves or other sites where the pictures occur. Then, more broadly, a comparison of south African art with that of the northern part of the continent, and with southern Europe, is a necessary coordination. Our historical study of south African paintings may well begin by reading H. Balfour's preface to Tongue's (1909) collection of a hundred Bushman rock paintings and engravings. Balfour states that the greater part of our first-hand information regarding the Bushman is derived from E. W. Stow's "Native Races of South Africa." According to Stow, there were two distinct branches of the Bushman people, who differed in their artistic methods as well as in their customs and language. Although both these groups are sup? posed to have reached south Africa from the north, they followed different routes. Stow refers to these groups as the Painters or Cave-dwellers and the Sculptors or Kopje-dwellers, respectively. Holub's scheme of four periods of art, three of gradual development and a fourth of decadence, is also mentioned by Balfour, who says that "the evidence upon which he bases his conclusions is not suf? ficiently clear to warrant acceptance without reserve. There is, however, valuable evidence afforded by patination of the rock sur</page><page sequence="142">Prehistory 147 faces, and this serves as a means of distinguishing the earlier examples from the latter, and emphasizes the fact that upon the whole the former are of a higher type than the latter." Balfour's preface, together with Tongue's introduction to the colored plates, gives a valuable r?sum? of the information available about thirty years ago. Balfour concludes by mentioning the stylistic affinities of Bushman art and that of the cave period of the Paleolithic age in western Europe. He observes that archaeological excavation in caves of south Africa where paintings occur is necessary for investigating a possible cultural and physical relationship between Bushmen and cave dwellers of Europe. Since the publications of Tongue (1909) and of Moszeik (1910), several compendiums of Bushman art have been issued, and promi? nent among these is the album of Zelizko, who uses the petroglyphs collected by Holub about fifty years ago. Other albums are those of D. Bleek (1930), who reproduces the rock paintings collected by G. W. Stow, with introduction and descriptive notes; Obermaier and K?hn (1930), whose work deals with rock paintings of southwest Africa; Lebzelter (1930); and Frobenius (1935). A recent work of conspicuous merit in this field is one by Wilman (1933), who has produced a book which will give the student a general survey of the problems to be solved and the methods that are being adopted. In addition to the representation of many engravings the work contains a large bibliography of 120 names, and a historical introduction which puts the reader in touch with the work accom? plished from 1824 to 1933. The distribution of the rock engravings of south Africa is then surveyed, and a map showing the occurrence of the sites is provided. Wilman's classification for south Africa gives four categories: Class 1 represents the oldest or "classical" styles, depicting animals with which the artists were familiar, as well as human beings, plants, and geometrical patterns. Class 2 contains the engravings which are derivatives from Class 1. In Division 3 the spoors of human beings and animals are represented, while Class 4 consists of scrib blings of recent date. With regard to the chronological sequence of engravings, the majority of the "classical" styles are divisible into groups based on differences in technique, but misleading factors are found in the chemical composition of different rocks. On some surfaces rust and black oxide form readily, and lichens grow quickly, so that an un? warranted impression of old age is given. Differences of opinion</page><page sequence="143">148 Source Book for African Anthropology exist respecting the tools used by the engravers, but a feasible hypothesis states that the boart (a form of diamond used for indus? trial purposes) may have been used. Who were the engravers? And do the stylistic differences justify an assumption of successive migrations? On the whole, the engravers showed more stylistic diversity than did the painters, yet some resemblance between the products of the engravers and the painters is evident. There are areas where paintings predominate, and localities where engravings are more numerous than paintings. M. Wilman inclines to the view that the early Bushmen to whom the works of art are ascribed were the phylogenetic forerunners of Bush? men who have produced recent engravings, but the osteological evidence for support or refutation of theories is too meager to be convincing. The modern belief that artists were actuated by im? pulses of magic and religion has possibly been overstressed. A study of the relative ages of rock paintings?Wilman dealt chiefly with engravings?may be followed from L. H. Wells (1933, pp. 131-157), who describes petrographs in the Cathkin Peak area, Natal. He selects paintings from the cave of the Eland, since these examples adequately illustrate the evolution of style. The series found in the remaining shelters confirmed the sequence found in the cave of the Eland, where, on the evidence of superposition, the paint? ings may be divided into eight main stages with four minor varia? tions; these stages are then summarized from the earliest to the most recent. Wells finally compares these styles of art with those of the four large stylistic groups of paintings in southern Africa: namely, an eastern group located in Southern Rhodesia, a western group in South West Africa, a central group in the eastern part of the Orange Free State, and a southern group in the Cape Peninsula. Technically and geographically, the Cathkin Peak paintings belong to the central group. All groups, though widely separated geographi? cally and in technique, are the work of peoples having the same cul? tural background. Discoveries in the cave earth together with the motifs of the paintings indicate that the Cathkin paintings of stages 2-8 were the work of a Bushman physical type, a purely hunting people, using the bow and arrow and practicing a late-stone-age culture. A later cultural factor is shown by paintings indicating the interests of a pastoral people. This distinction we have pre? viously observed in classifying the rock paintings and engravings of north Africa, where the pictures of hunters and game were</page><page sequence="144">Prehistory 149 described as the oldest Paleolithic type, and those including domestic animals were classed as Neolithic. As early as the year 1910, J. P. Johnson sought to correlate types of rock petrographs and petroglyphs with specific types of stone implements. He states that "Solutric petroglyphs" and rock paint? ings are distributed through the length and breadth of south Africa, and that the kind of surface available seemed to determine whether the artists would make engravings or paintings. This statement is, of course, at variance with a theory that correlates each type of art with a definite migration of artists. Johnson describes a primitive series of petroglyphs in the neighborhood of Vereeniging, where characteristic Solutric scrapers of chert are of common occurrence. He gives instructive illustrations that aid our study of style, showing technique which varies from pecking only the outline of an animal to filling in the whole interior of the petroglyph with either fine or coarse pecking. Attention is called to the limitations imposed on the skill of an artist by the difficult process of pecking or grooving with stone tools on a hard rock surface. Painting on a smooth surface obviously gave greater freedom to the craftsman, and in the latter form of art the artist departed from the single object to portray a complex motif, such as a hunting scene. Johnson's work does not, however, reveal any very specific relationship between types of art and patterns of stone implements. Coordination of the two main branches of archaeological evidence, namely, stone implements and pictorial art, is not yet far advanced for south Africa as a whole, but Armstrong (1931, p. 252) considers the depths at which different pigments were found in the floor of Bambata Cave in Southern Rhodesia. The pencils of hematite and ocher used in making the paintings provide a link between the paintings and the artifacts. The lowest pieces of coloring matter were balls of yellow ocher found at a depth of five feet. Red ocher was not found lower than 3 feet 6 inches, and the brown and red hematites were absent after the 2 foot 6 inch level, though frequent above that datum. The order in which the colors were found corre? sponds with the superposition of the wall paintings, the oldest being of yellow ocher, the raw supplies of which were found at the greatest depth in the cave floors. "It is noteworthy that the horizon upon which coloring material first occurred and which, presumably, masks the beginning of art in Rhodesia, is the point at which a distinct improvement in the technique of burins was noticed and from which horizon upward they were increasingly abundant." Armstrong</page><page sequence="145">150 Source Book for African Anthropology attributes this improvement to a new wave of Neanthropic people, or influence, from the north. "If this correlation between the cave paintings and the Upper Palaeolithic culture of South Africa is reliable, as I believe it to be, it provides a further and highly impor? tant link between it and the Upper Aurignacian of Europe, and supports the evidence for a common origin of both in the region of the Sahara of north Africa." The correlation of the Bambata cultures and cave paintings is further discussed by Armstrong (pp. 262-273), who finds from excava? tions near Bambata confirmatory archaeological evidence of the sequence of colors used in cave paintings, and this sequence agrees in color and style with that established for Bambata. The top cul? ture of the Maleme rock shelter was the Wilton, the implements of which prevailed to a depth of six inches; then followed a six-inch sterile layer, and below this an occupation layer containing typical Middle Bambata tools. Below twelve inches, the floor was sterile and the occupation by Neanthropic people appeared to be confined to the Middle Bambata phase. Following a general survey of stone-age cultures, Burkitt (1928) considers the pictorial art of south Africa (pp. 111-159). His work is one of compilation following a rather brief personal contact with south Africa, but as a general guide'the book is of great utility. So also is a brief survey of Rhodesian archaeology by N. Jones (1926), who speaks from long personal acquaintance. He has a section relating to cave paintings and petroglyphs (pp. 66-73). These two works summarize an enormous amount of periodical literature and together they should be a student's vade mecum. With regard to the broader question of prehistoric south African art in relation to that of north Africa, P?ringuey (1906) expressed his opinion thirty years ago. He refers to the early records of Barth and reproduces the figures copied by that explorer near Ghadames; this picture P^ringuey interprets in the light of present-day Bush? man-Hottentot mythology. P^ringuey then summarizes some of the arguments in favor of an ancient Paleolithic origin of some north African pictures. He goes further: "The comparison of some of the rock-engravings of Southern Algeria and those of the Sudan with those of Southern Africa, the technique, the subjects reproduced, are strong evidences that the aborigines of the north and those inhabiting at one time South Africa were one race." Again, in both north and south Africa there is in the form of pygmy implements</page><page sequence="146">Prehistory 151 and bored ostrich-eggshell disks evidence of a new culture?the Neolithic?which is similar in form for the extremes of the continent. Thirty years that have passed since the preliminary speculations of P?ringuey have served only to elaborate and confirm his hypoth? eses. Such corroboration is to be found in an article by Abb6 H. Breuil (1930a), who, following a comparative study of rock art in Spain, north Africa, and south Africa, observes that "one should therefore be prepared to admit a real relationship between the paintings of eastern Spain and those of south Africa." Dart (1925) goes further in his interpretation of the cultural significance of some south African art. Taking evidence of Otto, who copied Bushman paintings from rock shelters of the Kei River Valley in the eastern portion of the Cape Province, Dart finds new historical explanations of peculiar art forms in the hypothesis that certain head-dresses and other peculiarities are the portrayals of visiting foreigners, including Egyptians, Arabs, Mesopotamians. But Otto believes, in opposition to the general consensus of opinion, that Bushman art is indigenous; it was created in situ. In conclusion of the subject of prehistory in south Africa, a presi? dential address by C. van Riet Lowe (1930) may be quoted to in? dicate what has been achieved and what remains to be done. Some of his observations respecting the need for more systematic excava? tions, observation of stratification, and correlation of cultural and human skeletal remains with one another and with the Pleistocene Pluviations, have been previously noted. With regard to prehistoric art in south Africa, Lowe states that in no area of equal size is there such a wealth and variety of primitive artistic expression. So far as is known, the earliest artists were rock engravers who portrayed some animals, for example, Bubalus bainii and Equus capensis, which are now extinct. This early art is associ? ated with the Smithfield culture, which has Capsio-Aurignacian and Mousterian affinities. The engravings belong largely to the Lower Smithfield culture, the culture of a Neanthropic folk who replaced the middle-stone-age tribes of south Africa, whose technique was very like that of Mousterian Europe. In the petroglyphic art, in which probably four stages are discernible, there is the naturalistic expression of a hunting people. In the Union of South Africa, the first rock paintings are to be associated with the Middle phase of the Smithfield culture, and by the time of the Upper Smithfield culture the art of cave painting had expanded both geographically and technically. "Many of them are</page><page sequence="147">152 Source Book for African Anthropology indistinguishable from certain Capsian paintings of Eastern Spain. Correlation between this Eastern Spanish and certain phases of South African art is difficult, but there can be little, if any, doubt that these folk had a common origin.,, The order of succession is summarized: at first the engravers of the Lower Smithfield culture, then the engravers and painters of the Middle Smithfield, and, last of all, the true cave painters of the Upper Smithfield and Wilton. Lowe concludes by urging the necessity for preservation of existing engravings and paintings, and he stresses the need for copying pictures, to be accompanied by careful excavations of the cave floor or other adjacent ground so that the greatly needed task of correlating artifacts and paintings may be expedited. Stone Monuments and Buildings This general title has been selected to designate a great variety of constructions of stone, whose archaeological study has hardly begun. At present only a few miscellaneous notes can be offered respecting the occurrence of circles of upright stones, single megaliths (menhirs), tombs of stone, village enclosures, and hut circles. Topo? graphical distribution of these types, time sequence, associated stone implements, if any, are all matters for future research. Neither do the prehistorians know anything of the physique of the people who were responsible for an extensive use of stone in many areas where the Negro does not now build with that material. To a great extent, the stone builders passed away, leaving either no traditions or only a vague memory. Various publications give details of archaeological observations on the stone monuments of north Africa, Gambia in west Africa, Nigeria, Abyssinia, and Madagascar. But if the photographs and drawings of these are compared, there is no similarity of technique which suggests that these constructions were the work of immi? grants who were culturally similar. It is possible, however, that the intrusions were separated by long intervals, and, that each migratory wave had a distinctive type of construction. In some regions, mono? liths have been erected, but in other localities the stones are arranged in circles. The stone monuments of north Africa are sometimes regarded as the work of the Mediterranean race, who were part of the Caucasian-Hamitic matrix whose successive intrusions affected Europe as well as Africa. Bertholon and Chantre (1912, vol. 1, p. 243) state that megalithic sepultures of north Africa have been constructed by a Berber popu? lation from the bronze age to advanced historical times. From</page><page sequence="148">Prehistory 153 observations based on three groups of skulls, containing twenty, three, and three examples, respectively, two main types are dis? tinguishable; namely, a tall, dolichocephalic, long-faced, leptorrhine people, and a brachycephalic people. The human bones associated with megalithic sepultures indicate that the physical types prevailing when the sepultures were erected were much the same as extant types in the same region. Meek (1925, vol. 1, p. 55) notes a wide distribution of circular stone walls, which are specially abundant on the Bauchi Plateau. At Naraguta the circles are clearly the remains of huts whose builders used more stone than is commonly used by tribes today. Some of the larger circles were no doubt temporary granaries similar to those used by the Angas at present. Other enclosures were probably cattle kraals, and a stone enclosure on a hill may have been a fort. Meek also refers to an extant custom of the Gwari of Fuka, who sur? round their graves with circular stone walls having an upright monolith. In the Ba-Ron district of Bauchi Province, stone bridges occur, and of the origin of these the local residents profess ignorance. Meek thinks that stone walling may be the work of Jukun invaders, and that circular forts may have been built in the middle of the sixteenth century. Monteil (1932, pp. 27-29) reviews some of the observations of his compatriots in west Africa and quotes M. de Gironcourt as the discoverer of two types of primitive funerary monuments of stone. The first group includes lithic structures, each composed of four stones arranged in a square. Tradition speaks of one stone as male, the others as females. The second type of monument consists of three long steles with rounded extremities, almost two meters high. The material does not occur locally but can be traced to D?bo whence it was transported to Dj?nn?. These tombs of chiefs are probably not more than a thousand years old. Maxwell (1898) and J. L.Todd (1903) briefly referred to stone circles of Gambia, and more recently H. Parker (1923) calls attention to two distinct types of stone monuments in that region. In addition to menhirs (isolated upright stones), circles of stone pillars have been recorded. The rate at which the soil rises and tends to cover the fallen pillars is not known, but the general conclusion does not favor extreme antiquity. P. Laforgue (1931) pictures successive waves of stone-building immigrants from north to west Africa, and Parker favors a hypothesis of Carthaginian origin.</page><page sequence="149">154 Source Book for African Anthropology The Yolofs, a present-day tribe of Gambia, associate stone circles with the Earth Spirit, and resentment against excavation prevails. The statement that some of the builders of these monu? ments were acquainted with iron, rests on the single discovery of a barbed iron spearhead in undisturbed soil within one of the circles. Parker supports his Carthaginian hypothesis by mentioning the skill of the builders, the oval forms of the stones used, and the presence of holes in the tops of the upright stones. Possibly these holes were the containers of oil for primitive lamps such as the Carthaginians used. Hambly (1934, p. 207) records the existence of stone-built struc? tures in west-central Angola: "One of the sites has such a commanding view over extensive plains and valleys that the position would be almost impregnable. At the present day the line of fortifications is well marked by stone walls three feet high. These are composed of boulders to which the builders had ready access on adjacent hillsides. Large stones were no doubt rolled from the slopes to the small plateau chosen as a building site. This small plain lies midway between the hill crest and the valley. "At present this old site, which is enclosed by lichen-covered walls, is overgrown by tall grass and trees attaining twenty feet in height. Photography would be uninstructive unless a preliminary clearance were made?a formidable task owing to the density of vegetation. "In the center of the enclosure is a group of transported boulders possibly marking the site of a place of assembly. A search among the long grass reveals stone slabs and cylindrical crushers which were used for grinding grain over a very long period, as may be seen by the wear on the base stone; some thick stones are so worn as to be almost perforated. Weather-worn stones that were probably used as scrapers are to be found. Surface potsherds are of the material of which present-day Ovimbundu women make their cooking pots. These sherds mark the places now used by small nomadic bands, hence the surface pottery may have no connection with pre Umbundu culture. "In the vicinity of this walled stone village are hillside cairns marking the sites of graves. These have been robbed by medicine? men in search of material for their charms. "The Ovimbundu have no traditions regarding the site, neither is there legendary or other evidence to show that the Ovimbundu ever made their villages of stone. The raising of a cairn of stones</page><page sequence="150">Prehistory 155 over the body of a hunter is, however, a present-day practice near Ganda and in the Esele country." At present, one can do no more than call attention to recent records of building in stone, and the recording of the instances to? gether here carries no implication of cultural connection. The data available represent the primary stage of observation, merely the recording of some archaeological puzzles, a stage through which prehistorians passed in their first contacts with stone implements and with rock pictures. Megalithic monuments of Abyssinia have been discussed by Neuville (1928), who refers to the researches of Verneau, Pottier, Kammerer, and Chudeau. The article shows how purely speculative are the classifications according to designs, and there is no sure foundation of archaeological or paleontological evidence on which to build a chronology; local tradition is almost entirely lacking. A comprehensive work by Azais and Chambard (1931) gives data of interest concerning the outward forms and the geographical dis? tribution of such megalithic monuments as dolmens, remains of ancient towns, tumuli, menhirs, and anthropomorphic stones, but historically a reader is left where he began. Azals (p. 179) gives the views of M. B&amp;i?dite, who ascribes some of the stones to a cul? tural period of Egyptian origin, and of M. M. Pottier, who regards the Abyssinian lithic structures as part of a megalithic culture that spread from Asia to north and east Africa, and to western Europe, but whether to Africa first is unknown (p. 241). Evans-Pritchard (1935) has made a study of megalithic grave monuments in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, and it is possible that some of these are historically and culturally allied to some of the Abyssinian types. This question of the migration is an old, unsolved archaeological problem which was to the fore at the meetings of the British Associa? tion in 1912. Here G. Elliot Smith gave some points in favor of a migration of culture carriers with a tendency toward megalithic construction. Such a view, he argues, is more reasonable than that which postulates that every society has, at some stage of cultural development, a tendency toward megalithic building. Peet (1912) again stresses Elliot Smith's contention that the megaliths are often of like form and that they follow the natural routes of migration along littoral regions and not in the interiors. Peet thinks that the theory of trade relationships in the Neolithic period is inadequate to account for such a widely distributed method of megalithic build? ing, which was often associated with burial. He concludes: "There</page><page sequence="151">156 Source Book for African Anthropology remains the explanation that megalithic architecture was practiced by some great race which at the end of the Neolithic age spread over parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, carrying this method of building with it." Supporters of such a theory of migration might find evidence in a paper contributed by A. L. Lewis, who describes stone monu? ments found in Madagascar. He summarizes the views of several archaeologists who have diverse opinions on the origin and function of Madagascan megaliths. Baudoin, quoted by Lewis, thinks that some stones are of great antiquity, and that they were erected by sun worshipers. On the contrary, certain local traditions point to the erection of the monuments only a few centuries ago in order to commemorate tribal victories. A large stone with a small one at the side is said to represent a conqueror and his vassal; other stones are regarded as tokens of gratitude to a chief or were erected to mark the founding of a new village. To assure fertility and easy parturition women grease the stones and rub against them. Stones placed as grave markers are connected with a cult of ancestors, and a person seeking ancestral protection rubs his hands on the effigy or sucks the breasts. Linton (1933, pp. 180-184, 197, 199) adduces some evidence respect? ing the erection of memorial stones and tombstones. This is a present-day practice for which are given some valuable details show? ing the method of transporting a heavy menhir. All the Menabe clan memorial stones are used as places of sacrifice, but sacrifice to the gens ancestors as a group is not the purpose of their erection. In Madagascar, as elsewhere, megaliths have no doubt served various purposes and no single statement will suffice to describe the periods, the types of stones, and their several functions. A very ancient uniform practice would probably give rise to diverse forms of building, and to the origin of new ideas in association with these. One may be assured that the historical explanation of existing megaliths with attendant beliefs and ceremonies is not a simple one. Linton has, however, made a valuable contribution in recording extant customs, since these, though perhaps recently revived, may be a recurrence of ancient traits. Within the past few years, several observers have called attention to building with stones that are placed together without cement. The Negro does not often build with stone today, and he seldom has any clear tradition of his forebears who brought together large boulders to form hut circles and village walls. Data relating to these</page><page sequence="152">Prehistory 157 are so meager that no estimate of age is possible, and there exists no evidence to connect utilitarian building in stone with the erection of megaliths which, so far as the evidence goes, were ceremonial. Records by Trevor (1930) of stone building in south Africa include a mention of stone-built villages which are found all over the Trans? vaal; in the Lydenburg district there are some stone-built kraals. With regard to the largest of these kraals, "neither the Boers nor the natives knew who had built it or what purpose it had served. It was there when the white man arrived?that is all that is known about it." The other items, all presumably relics of an extinct civilization, are dressed-stone building, conical towers, the use of curved batter, stone circles, terraced hills, and evidences of irrigation. A report on the stone huts of Vechtkop (Lowe, 1927) leads to the conclusion that these were built by the Leghoya or Bataung, who were Bantu invaders from the north early in the eighteenth century. This gives a very recent setting to the stone building of that area. A detailed study of terracing and irrigation of unknown date has been undertaken by G. E. H. Wilson (1932), who gives a map showing the distribution of these traits from Kenya to Nyasaland. The remains of these ancient works occur in Tanganyika, Abyssinia, Uganda, Kenya, and Northern Rhodesia, so forming a chain of evi? dence from north to south down a migratory route of the Rift Valley. But the question of construction of these works remains unanswered. The art of terracing is not lost, however; it still survives in Tangan? yika in the neighborhood of Meru and Kilimanjaro. The Wambulu (Iraku) in the north and the Wabena of the south follow the practice. Tradition speaks of an alien and dominant race described by the words "tall," "bearded," and "enemy" or "stranger." A people called the Wamea are spoken of in connection with the ancient agricultural system and with the origin of rock paintings at Bahi. From the growth of large trees on the top of the terracing at Mufindi, Iringa Province, one may assume that the terrace was abandoned at least nine hundred years ago. Wilson attaches much importance to the fact that "wherever this ancient system of agriculture either exists or has not yet been forgotten, there are place-names beginning with 'Ru' foreign to the present nomenclature." Ex hypothesi, the old civilization came from the north and spread its influence along the Rift Valley and over the highlands surrounding the Great Lakes, until it perhaps reached Zimbabwe and "eventually developed into a great and separate nation, whose fame, reaching the seafaring peoples of the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, caused them to establish</page><page sequence="153">158 Source Book for African Anthropology trade routes and build factories, such as Rhapta, in order to open up communication and exploit the East Coast trade." This civilization of east Africa has been more recently discussed by Huntingford (1933), who refers to substantial enclosures of stone, hut circles, revetted walls, properly engineered roads, and irrigation. This combination he refers to as the Azanian culture, in order to distinguish it from stone-age cultures and Islamic ruins. Following a description of these evidences of civilization come the questions, who were the Azanians and when did they flourish? No definite answer can be given, but Huntingford surmises that a civilization which flourished in the Horn of Africa at some time during the first seven hundred years a.d. was destroyed by Islam, that its makers retreated southward through Kenya (where Islam never penetrated), and that the culture came to an end somewhere about the fourteenth or fifteenth century, possibly earlier. That the civilization was of Hamitic rather than Bantu origin seems to be an unescapable con? clusion. Huntingford agrees with Wilson that the Azanians were probably connected with the establishment of seaports named Adule (modern Zeila), Aromatophora (spice market), and Rhapta, though the time of origin and the present locations of these sites are not certain. Evidently the tentative dating of this well-developed stone building culture of east and south Africa, if correct, does not justify the inclusion of the discoveries with prehistoric archaeology, since the time suggested for the building is well within our own era. Zimbabwe, which may represent the acme of this period of con? struction in stone, I have grouped with historical data, because the most recent pronouncement relegated the structures to a period between the ninth and thirteenth centuries of our era. With the exception of descriptions of Zimbabwe stone buildings, all important accounts of construction in stone have been written during recent years, so introducing a new field of inquiry into the antiquity, the somatic characters, the migrations, and the other traits of the culture carriers, much of whose work is now to be classed as a lost art. The details recorded indicate that any attempt to establish a cultural or chronological unity between the types of stone buildings, whether menhirs, dolmens, or walled enclosures, would be premature. On the grounds of typology, two major divisions, possibly representing two distinct incursions of stone-using people, are discernible. On the one hand, the dolmen-menhir type of structure may be ascribable to truly prehistoric and Neolithic</page><page sequence="154">Prehistory 159 invaders who traveled along the north of the continent and down the east side as far as Madagascar. On the other hand, the miscellaneous remains of utilitarian building in stone may be the survival of an early kind of construction, discouraged and finally supplanted by other methods brought by later migrants. That utilitarian building in stone, as well as the erection of cere? monial stones, might have several independent centers of develop? ment is not impossible; but by inference from the general data of invention and diffusion as seen in both ancient and modern times, and with due regard to the nature of the African routes along which the principal stone erections occur, a succession of independent muta? tions is far less likely than a gradual penetration of cultures which assumed local variations as the immigrant waves advanced. The extent of country over which the traits are manifest, and the associa? tion of several traits in east Africa, definitely suggest human migra? tion on a considerable scale rather than the handing on of traits by casual travel. conclusion The foregoing summary has attempted to show that considerable progress has been made in the study of African archaeology since the first observations of stone implements were recorded. Such knowledge as we have has been built up during half a century, but only in the past decade has there been methodical concentration, a visualizing of the problems, and an attempt to correlate the studies of geology, paleontology, and archaeology. More than a correlation of subjects is needed, however, and an attempt has been made to unify observations from southern Europe and from widely separated parts of Africa (Menghin, 1931, pp. 48, 51, 53). The advance has been considerable, but an enormous amount of systematic excavation remains to be done everywhere, especially in west and central Africa. With the task of exploring sites, the work of correlating the evidence of climatic change, geological stratifica? tion, types of implements, rock pictures, and fossilized human bones, must advance pari passu. The weakest link in the chain is the paleontological evidence respecting the somatic characters of the creators and carriers of the cultures we have discussed. The total amount of evidence respecting the physical appearance of African races through the Pleistocene is woefully small, and if the ultimate aim of archaeological research</page><page sequence="155">160 Source Book for African Anthropology is to give definite information concerning human beings, their cul? tures and wanderings, we must regard the occurrence of human skeletons as being the crucial evidence for prehistoric migrations. The importance of typology has been stressed by Gorodzov (1933), and the necessity for classification cannot be denied. But, as Hooton says (1936, p. 104), the typological delusion can be "a sort of auto-hypnosis brought on by too concentrated and prolonged gaz? ing upon a single class of archaeological objects, as into a crystal. The archaeologist begins to see things which are not there." It is undoubtedly true that, despite the value of type studies of implements and rock pictures, and the association of these with one another and with the geological evidence, further anatomical material is essential. If the main purpose of archaeology is to give informa? tion concerning past races and their migrations, then the crucial evidence is the discovery of unchallengeable anatomical evidence. Until such testimony is forthcoming, we have to rely for our inferences on the indirect testimony of like stone-age cultures, their comparable geological sequences, and the stylistic affinities of prehistoric art in various regions. Leakey (1936a), "Stone Age Africa," givesa summary of the archae? ology of the continent as a whole. Since my own compilation and that of Leakey were produced quite independently they should prove to be useful complementary studies. Leakey's work contains an extensive bibliography.</page><page sequence="156">IV. PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY Technique In our endeavor to present a clear picture of the somatic traits of African peoples of the present day, many theoretical questions have been reserved until the final section of the chapter. There is one difficulty, however?that of nomenclature?that cannot be post? poned. We will at present avoid the use of the word race and speak of people, employing the word according to general everyday usage in the sense of persons or individuals. This will avoid the assumption that "race" has a clear connotation, and that definite biological ideas may be legitimately connected with the word. Unfortunately, there are in African ethnology some terms of unscientific origin which have been loosely employed with various biological, linguistic, and cultural implications. Our present concern is only with the use of the terms Hamitic, Semitic, Pygmy, Bushman, Hottentot, and Negro in their relation to physical anthropology. Further advances in anthropometry will no doubt provide an improved terminology, but until that is available the old nomen? clature, with certain explanations, may be made to serve our purpose. Let us for the present avoid the difficulty of precise definition, and of speculation respecting origins, by glancing at the series of pictures accompanying this chapter. If, in addition to making a careful inspection of these physical types, a student will turn to the following works, he will have in mind a clear mental picture of the general somatic traits that are associated with the terms used to designate people of different phylogeny and geographical distribution. Of considerable pictorial value and in some instances of statistical importance are the works of Weninger (1927), F?lleborne (1906), Duggan-Cronin (1928-37), H. H. Johnston (1902a), and Weiss (1910). Bernatzik (1929) has published some remarkably fine studies of Nilotic Negroes. These references, in conjunction with Hambly (1934a and 1935a), will give a clear idea of Negro types in all parts of Africa. Barnard (1923) and Hambly (1930a) have brought together a variety of pictorial types in popular presentations. For Hamitic types of east Africa, C. G. Seligman (1913, 1917, 1925) and Cerulli (1935) should be consulted, while the work of Paulitschke (1888) contains excellent photographs of eastern Hamitic types. 161</page><page sequence="157">162 Source Book for African Anthropology Bertholon and Chantre (1912), also Coon (1931), provide num? erous illustrations of Hamitic and Semitic types of north Africa, while Field (1935) has published a valuable statistical and pictorial source book for Semitic types, which may be regarded as the matrix from which African Semites were derived. Hoefler (1930) has produced some excellent illustrations of Ituri Pygmies, and more recently Schebesta and Lebzelter (1933) have supplemented their statistical study of Pygmies with a collection of photographs. For Bushman types, the best available are those taken by the Vernay-Lang Kalahari Expedition of Field Museum (Figs. 45-47). But more than a general mental impression of types is demanded; therefore, to give precision to ideas of physical development some statistical work is necessary, and here another difficulty is encoun? tered. The fact is astonishing that, taking Africa as a whole, we have at our disposal very few series of anthropometric averages based on as many as one hundred individuals in the group. A series con? sisting of a hundred is usually considered to be a minimum for the working out of averages that can be safely regarded as a fair sample. When, in addition to this obstacle of paucity of data, we add doubts as to the method of sampling and the techniques adopted in taking the measurements, the data for comparative statistical study are small. Yet some legitimate samples of anthropometry exist, and other figures, if not relied upon too confidently, can be of value in showing general somatic trends. For understanding the data of this chapter, R. Martin's "Lehr? buch der Anthropologie" (1928) is of great service. Hrdlicka (1920), and Stibbe (1930) have produced elementary textbooks of physical anthropology, while L. H. D. Buxton (1932) and Buxton and Morant (1933) have written useful articles on the standardization of technique. For statistical work, Udny Yule (1912, 1924) is still sound, but Fisher (1932) and Gavett (1937) are regarded as the most useful of recent textbooks on statistics. So far as I am aware, no physical anthropologist has prepared a textbook of statistical method as applied to physical anthropology. At present, a student must learn his general principles and apply them to anthropometric data, but for the non-mathematical a textbook simplifying the erudite articles of "Biometrika" and translating some of them into clear arithmetical examples would be welcome. There is a great need for a textbook of statistics written entirely for the student of physical anthropology.</page><page sequence="158">Physical Anthropology 163 With regard to our tentative classification of physical types, which is based on pictorial study, the following divisions will serve as a basis for comparisons: (1) Negroes, western, central, eastern, southern, Nilotic. (2) Khoisan People (Bushmen and Hottentots). (3) Pygmies (chiefly of the Ituri Forest). (4) Hamites, northern (Berbers and Tuareg) and eastern (Somali, Beja, Hadendoa), Half-Hamites (the Masai). (5) Semites (Bedouin and other Arabs, Kababish of Kordofan). In connection with this research, an explanation of terms used in describing living subjects is necessary. Statures are given in milli? meters, and conversion to inches is readily made by taking 2.5 cm. to one inch. The cephalic index (C.I.) is a figure expressing the percentage relation of the maximum breadth of a head to the maxi? mum length. The nasal index (N.I.) expresses the relationship of the breadth of the nose to the length. In A. C. Haddon's tables (1925, p. 9), persons under 1480 mm. (58.25 inches) in height are said to be of pygmy stature. A measure? ment between 1480 and 1580 mm. (58.25-62.25 inches) indicates short stature. Persons of medium stature have height measurements between 1580 and 1680 mm. (62.25-66 inches). Tall people have a stature between 1680 and 1720 mm. (66-67.75 inches) or more. Head measurements made in many parts of the world show that most people have cephalic indices between 70 and 85. An index of 75 and under indicates a long head (dolichocephaly). Indices be? tween 75 and 80 express a medium formation (mesaticephaly). Broad-headed (brachycephalic) persons have cephalic indices of 80 and above. Nasal indices between 55 and 70 indicate narrow noses (leptor rhine condition). Mesorrhine noses, that is, noses of medium breadth, have indices between 71 and 85. Platyrrhine noses have indices from 86 to 100. Seligman (1930, Appendix II, p. 252) gives a con? version table in inches and meters. Negroes Before considering the differences of measurement in topographi? cal groups of Negroes some attempt should be made to summarize the salient physical features of the Negro group as a whole. T. W. Todd (1928) in a search for specific bodily Negro features speaks of the proportions of the pelvis, the nose, the lips, and the interpupillary distance as "entrenched." American Negroes have long arms com</page><page sequence="159">164 Source Book for African Anthropology pared with the whites, and arm length is the controlling factor for length and breadth of the hand. The Negro has a narrow pelvis expressed in terms of his torso; the pelvis is narrow absolutely and relatively. The forearm of the Negro is a little long, the upper arm a little short compared with the proportions in white people. Furthermore, T. W. Todd (1929, p. 67) states: "We have been forced to the conclusion that, in our Negro hybrids, some features are more stable or more firmly entrenched than others, and that these features are mostly to be found in the face. Shall we conclude that this is a result of differential stability of hereditary pattern, or are we to assume that increasing homogeneity of our Negroes [see Her skovits, 1928] is bringing about this stability of African form? Both factors may be at work. But since traits cannot again be imprinted in a stock from which they have once been expunged, the features in question must belong to the hereditary pattern." Figures 25 and 26 illustrate the more important somatic traits of the Negro, which have been summarized by Hooton (1931, p. 512). Stature, robustness of torso, and length of limbs, are variable from one topographical group to another. To take two extremes, the Kru of Liberia are thick-set and of medium height, while the Vakwanyama of south Angola are tall and slender. Nevertheless, Hooton's summary gives the more important traits which can be regarded as truly characteristic of Negroes. The hair is woolly, black, coarse in texture, short on the head and sparsely developed on the face and body. The skin color is dark brown (Ovimbundu) or nearly black (Dinkas), and the eye is similarly pigmented. There is pronounced facial protrusion (prognathism), and the lips are thick, puffy, and everted. The bridge of the nose is low, broad, and short, while the alae of the nostrils are thick and flaring; the nasal index is always in the platyrrhine group. The profile is concave or straight, rarely convex. These facial traits are clearly shown in the picture of a Bini of southern Nigeria (Fig. 25, a). Since our analysis is concerned chiefly with modal values, as indicated by frequency distributions that illustrate general trends, mathematical averages with their standard deviations and standard errors are unnecessary. But for those who wish to make a more thorough comparison of arithmetic means, two formulae are of ser? vice. For comparing fairly large groups in a population in order to determine whether the observed differences are significant, or whether they might have arisen from random sampling, the formula Mx-Ma &gt; 3 V (PEi)2 + (PE2)2</page><page sequence="160">Physical Anthropology 165 is appropriate. For comparing the averages of small groups to test the significance of the difference of the means, Fisher (1932, pp. 120 124) uses the t test by use of the formula A 1 m X nl = j. a "v ni + Il2 where A is the difference of the means, a the standard deviation of all the terms in the two series, and nu n2 the number of terms in each series. Confining ourselves to the general class distribution of values for height, cephalic index, and nasal index of males only, we can compare these values for Negroes of different geographical regions. The terms "Bantu" and "Sudanic" Negroes should, if possible, be avoided in connection with divisions based on somatic traits, since the words have a definite linguistic connotation. Continued research may, however, justify the association of the terms "Bantu" and "Sudanic" with definitely different series of measurements, since somatic differences do exist between Negroes of the two main linguistic divisions, and within each of the groups. But paucity of anthropometric data prevents us from making definite statements that would at present correlate types of physique with linguistic divisions. western negroes (Table 1) Stature.?The longest series available are the 100 Bambara, Tukolor, and others measured by Weninger (1927), and the 100 Hausa measured by Tremearne (1911). Weninger's subjects were sampled from several tribes representing a wide area, as his map shows. With regard to Tremearne's data, the word Hausa is lin? guistic, and both Sudanic and Hamitic elements are in the speech. Moreover, as Tremearne points out, his subjects were gathered from a fairly wide area. These are, however, the largest and most homo? geneous samples we have from the western Negro region. Taking first the stature, we find that 28 per cent of Weninger's subjects have a modal stature of 1650-1700 mm., and 41 per cent are in the tall and very tall classes; about 10 per cent are short. Among Tremearne's Hausa, the height frequently is as follows: Less than 9 per cent are short, 77 per cent are medium to tall, and 14 per cent are very tall, giving measurements between 1750-1900 mm. Both Weninger's and Tremearne's men have the same modal value for height, namely, 1650-1700 mm. In Cameroons, the stature seems to fall somewhat if we take the frequency distribution of groups</page><page sequence="161">?g 0) bo 2 i s o 166</page><page sequence="162">o ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ? ^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^1 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^Hl^^^^^^l 167</page><page sequence="163">O CO e &lt;D PQ cm o 13 Eh o B o a .2 g be ? 2 43 *+-( 08 O ^ 0) O bfi ?is cq Is ~S B ^ ? s 0&gt; ?4-4 50 s 55 , PS W co PQ ? o 3 * &lt; H ?

Montandon's data contain the figures of Malcolm and other observers. Malcolm gives forty groups (based on different numbers of measurements, all of them small), and eighteen of these groups, that is, nearly 50 per cent, are in the class interval 1600 1650 mm., that is, one interval lower than the modal value of Wen inger's and Tremearne's samples. Considering sixteen groups (comprising 188 males), Montandon's figures show that seven of these groups, about 50 per cent, fall in the class interval 1600-1650 mm. The Cameroons samples show a definite lowering of stature compared with more westerly groups of Weninger and Tremearne. Between Cameroons and the far west is the mid-course of the Niger, where Ruelle (1904) measured 100 Mossi and 78 Lobi. The former gave an average height of 1712 mm., and the latter 1754 mm., both definitely in the tall class. Figures given by Talbot (1916) show definitely a tall strain in the Kanembu, Buduma, and other tribes near Lake Chad. The six averages given are for five different tribes; there are two samples for the Buduma with 12 mm. difference. One sample for Buduma (32) gives 1742 mm. as the average, and the other sample (132) gives 1730 mm. as the average stature. The range of averages is therefore 1723 (Mundong tribe) to 1785 mm. (Banana tribe); all are definitely tall. The general impression is that the Negroes of the west are upper medium to tall except in Cameroons, where the medium height 1600-1650 prevails. Cephalic Index.?Let us consider the cephalic index for these western groups. Beginning again with our best samples, we find that 50 per cent of Weninger's Negroes have a C.I. of 70-75, and 39 per cent fall in the class interval 75-80 per cent. These two intervals account for 89 per cent of the sample. With an index lower than 70 there are only 6 per cent, and with an index above 80 there are only 5 per cent. The average C.I. is 74.6. The sample is predominantly dolichocephalic (50 per cent) with a strong mesaticephalic (39 per cent) tendency. In Tremearne's (1911) sample 51 per cent are dolichocephalic (C.I. 70-75) and 27 per cent mesaticephalic (C.I. 75-80). This distribution is almost identical with that of Weninger's sample. In the Cameroons samples a change in the frequency distribution of head form can be observed, for in comparison with the populations sampled by Weninger and Tremearne, the Cameroons population</page><page sequence="167">172 Source Book for African Anthropology tends toward brachycephaly. Of the forty groups (not individuals) recorded by Malcolm, thirty-one (77.5 per cent) have averages that bring them into the mesaticephalic class (C.I. 75-80). Of nineteen group averages given by Montandon, seventeen are in the class interval 75-80. Therefore, despite the fact that the averages of many groups are based on small numbers, the general tendency toward brachycephaly cannot be doubted. Struck's (1922) data for cephalic indices in the Cameroons relate to sixty-one tribes, and 831 men con? tributed to the series; the number of measurements are not, however, distributed evenly among the sixty-one tribes represented. There are 61.6 per cent of the samples having the fairly high C.I. of 77-81. The Mossi and the Lobi of the mid-west region have dolichocephalic indices of 74.6 and 74.4 respectively, and the Lake Chad tribes measured by Talbot have, with the exception of the Banana (C.I. 77.3), a range of average indices from 71.7 for the Kanembu to 74.1 for the Bagirimi. Nasal Index.?A- large number (85 per cent) of Weninger's Negroes had a nasal index between 80 and 110. The most important class intervals are 90-100 with 33 per cent of the population, and almost as large is the 80-90 class interval with 32 per cent of the population. The figures for Tremearne's Hausa indicate that their noses are narrower than among Weninger's Negroes. A glance at the Hausa (Fig. 59) shows modification of Negro features as compared with the Bini (Fig. 25, a), who is a typical Negro. Whereas only 7 per cent of Weninger's Negroes were in the 70-80 class interval, as many as 20 per cent, nearly three times as many, of Tremearne's Hausa have a N.I. from 70-80, which is low for a Negro population. There is no mistaking the change in the trend of the figures, for the shift of values in the Hausa curve is clearly toward the lower class intervals when compared with the Weninger Negro curve. The adequate samples of Ruelle give N.I. 104.6 for the Mossi and 102.7 for the Lobi; these tribes are therefore in the higher ranges of platyrrhine intervals. About 20 per cent of Weninger's Negroes were in the class interval of N.I. 100-110, but only 11 per cent of Tremearne's Hausa were in this hyperplatyrrhine class. Talbot's series have ranges of tribal averages varying from N.I. 92.7 to 108.3. central negroes (Table 2) Stature.?Inspection of the averages of stature for Belgian Congo tribes reveals the general prevalence of medium stature, and some tribe sshow an average close to the "short" division (1480-1580 mm.).</page><page sequence="168">i i 03 1 1 rrj m d d i 1 xn m xfi p. * ** Si S| a a i:-a| Alisas .3 o 'S-* o rH 00 ^ ^ 10 0)2? nCS o4^ r 0, ~ s-&lt;cn ri, ^ cc ^ &lt;d th ?12 as r ?&gt;. o gi n i. ?. *m- limiii 5^ ?5 -?-?

The tribes nearing the "short" class are the Babira (1605 mm.) and the Bakondjo (1592 mm.). Two tall groups are present; namely, the Azande in the northeast, with an average of 1701 mm., and the Bushongo in the southwest, with an average stature of 1747 mm. Possibly the explanation of this stature distribution may be that the Azande have inherited a trait of their near neighbors, the Nilotic Negroes. As for the Bushongo, their traditions refer to migration from the north? east, where the high statures occur. The medium to short statures of other tribes may be due to infusion of a Pygmy strain, for current hypothesis states that Pygmies were at one time much more widely distributed in the Congo region than they are at present. The most extensive figures available are those collated by Mon tandon (1928), from whose data a series of 37 averages for different tribes can be obtained. The number of males contributing to these averages was 1834. The frequency distribution of these 37 averages shows that only two are in the "short" range (1500-1550 mm.), but 15 of the tribal averages fall in the "low-to-medium" class interval of 1550-1600 mm., and there are eight groups in the class of medium statures (1600-1650 mm.). The general trend of statures is from "short" to "medium." Cephalic Indices.?All definitely trend toward brachycephaly, the ranges of the averages for the first nine tribes quoted on the table being 76.8 to 80.3. When we turn to Struck's data, which are derived from 1,584 males, giving 119 averages for 117 tribes which are widely distributed, we have the same brachycephalic tendency emphasized. Of dolichocephalic groups (C.I. 70-75), there are only 15 examples; that is, 12.6 per cent of the groups are long-headed. In the mesa ticephalic class intervals, there is a gradual increase in the number of averages falling in each interval, until we have a maximum of twenty-five groups in the interval C.I. 77-78, which is high mesati cephaly. Of the 119 groups 65 are in the range 77-80, quite close to brachycephaly, and 16 groups are definitely brachy cephalic, with a C.I. of 80-83. This brachycephalic tendency in the Congo region definitely agrees with that of the Cameroons, but is distinctly different from the preponderating dolichocephaly and low mesaticephaly of our western series. Nasal Index.?For the central area, the nasal index has a somewhat lower range than that in the western group. Since the averages for the western and central areas are based on widely different numbers,</page><page sequence="170">Physical Anthropology 175 we may not average the averages, and this is unnecessary, for a glance at the western averages shows that they run in the 90's to 100, while those for the Congo are usually in the 80's. Of Mon tandon's forty-seven averages for N.I., twenty-six are in the 80-90 range, and nine of the groups are in the 90-95 range. The Azande (217) and the Momvou (241) are just within the mesorrhine category, and the Bakondjo (297) with an index of 85 are right on the border of the platyrrhine category. Most of the groups measured are definitely platyrrhine but seldom touch the index of 100. south and southwestern negroes (Table 3) Stature.?For the Bavenda (168), Stayt (1931a) has given data which show that the modal value of stature is 1650-1700 mm. Above that class interval, there are thirty men in the 1700-1750 mm. group, and nineteen men in the 1750-1800 mm. group. The majority of men are definitely in the tall class, and the result obtained from Stayt's measurements agrees well with the observations of Cipriani (1930-31), who gives 1696 mm. as the average height of thirty-nine Zulu, and 1712 mm. for twenty-three Batonga. C. G. Seligman (1930), quoting from a manuscript of Turner, gives 1670 mm. as the average height of a large miscellaneous group of 4,098 natives of south and lower east Africa. In Angola the height standards of the south African observations are maintained, and the tribes sampled are either definitely in the tall class or at the top of the medium class. Hambly's unpublished figures for 53 Ovimbundu give the average stature as 1687 mm., cephalic index 73.1, and nasal index 87.9. The Ovimbundu are more dolichocephalic and less platyrrhine than the other tribes of Angola, mentioned by Cardoso (1916). Cephalic Index.?The figures indicate great uniformity in the C.I. for various tribes. Stayt's Bavenda are equally divided between the dolichocephalic class of 70-75, and the mesaticephalic class of 75-80. The Zulu have an index of 75.4, while the Batonga are somewhat longer-headed (72.3). In Angola Cardoso's range of average indices for four tribes is 75.1-77.1. Struck (1922) gave samples of indices from Angola which show that out of twenty-one tribes sampled eight had an average index of 75-76. Ten of the tribes had average indices of 72-75, and three tribes were in the higher ranges of mesaticephaly with indices of 77-78. There is in this whole series from south Africa a definite preponderance of moderate dolichocephaly rising gradually</page><page sequence="171">&lt; ft 85 d of co.? o"43 ? ft+j &lt;d 03 0"X5 t o 10 ft ft CO I o CO as 0^ tO ft&lt;M 5 SM ?5 0 %&lt; aT$ rH . ? ft*~ IH * a&gt; ?

Only 4 per cent of Stayt's sample of 168 men were in the brachycephalic class 80-85. Nasal Index.?Stayt's 168 Bavenda give the modal value of 95 100, which is in the higher ranges of the platyrrhine group, and 37 (22 per cent) were hyperplatyrrhine (100-110). Cipriani's averages of 92.0 and 90.9 are near to the modal value of Stayt's large sample. The indices given by other observers are very consistent; all are in the 90-100 group. The Zulu and the Batonga have somewhat narrower noses than the Bavenda. In Angola the average nasal indices are mainly consistent, being 98.6, 98.5, 97.4, 96.6 and 87.9 for five tribes. The Ovimbundu (N. I. 87.9) have the narrowest noses. eastern negroes (Table 4) Stature.?The samples of tribal averages show that statures in east Africa are nearly all within the medium group, 1580-1680 mm. The Wanyamwezi (101) are very close to the tall class with an average stature of 1675 mm., which is close to that of Roscoe's (1911) estimate for 288 Baganda having a height of 1673 mm. The Landins are just within the tall group with an average of 1686 mm., but the sample (14) is too small to be reliable. Montandon's data of fifty-seven averages give a modal value for averages of 1650-1700, with nearly as many of the averages in the 1600-1650 group. Only a few of the averages are definitely in the tall category of over 1700 mm. Cephalic Index.?The cephalic indices are remarkably consistent. Glancing down a column of eighteen averages, we find they range from 72.6 to 77.6 as absolute extremes. The clustering of the averages is around 74-75 according to Struck's (1922) data for 68 tribes, in 57 groups, representing 916 males. Montandon's col? lection of data yields a frequency distribution having a modal value for averages of 75-76. Of the 57 group averages given by Montandon, 40, that is, 70 per cent of them, have a value between 74-76, doli? chocephalic to slightly mesaticephalic. Nasal Index.?Noses undoubtedly are broader as we proceed to sample the east side of Africa from Uganda to Nyasaland. The Baganda and Akamba have noses close to the mesorrhine condition, with N.I. 85.4 and 86.5 respectively, but glancing down the column we find the N.I. value gradually rising as the figures for the lower east African tribes are quoted.

Montandon's data for forty-four groups give a modal value of 85-90 for the N.I. Only two of Montan? don's east African Negro groups have an index over 100, but 20 per cent of Weninger's western sample of 100 were in the 100-110 class interval. The Negroes with wider noses are on the western side of the continent. nilotic negroes (Table 5) Stature.?Out of sixteen tribal averages for the Dinka, Shilluk, Nuer, Bari, Turkana, Nuba, and Mandari, only one is below the 1700 mm. mark, namely, one of the Nuba groups having an average of 1698 mm. All Nilotic groups measured are definitely in the tall class, whereas in all other topographical samples the tall class was small. Two of our Nilotic samples touch the 1800 mm. mark?as an average. Cephalic Index.?The twenty-four samples of average cephalic indices clearly illustrate the dolichocephalic tendency of Nilotic Negroes, since eighteen of the samples are below the figure 75, and the mode is 73-74. That these Negroes have longer heads than other groups is shown by Montandon's range of averages, which are all in the low category 69.3-73.4, lower than those of any other group. Nasal Index.?There are four out of seventeen averages with a N.I. of above 100; and though the averages agree with those of our other Negro groups in lying chiefly between 90-100, there is among the Dinka, Shilluk, and Nuer a tendency to the hyperplatyrrhine con? dition. (Figs. 27 and 28 show front and side views of a Nilote of the Bari tribe.) skull measurements Measurements made on Negro crania are insufficient for a thorough comparison with data from the living. For both the living and the dead, the results are based on anthropometric samples which for the main part are too small to be reliable. Krum (1913, pp. 175 181) measured eighty-four male skulls of the Wachagga of Kili? manjaro in northeast Tanganyika Territory. The modal value (19 per cent of the skulls) is 1400-1450 cc. for the cranial capacity, but nearly as many (about 17 per cent) are in the 1450-1500 cc. group. About 28 per cent of the skulls have a C.I. in the 70-75 category; the modal value is 75-80 C.I. for about 55 per cent of the skulls, and the remainder are brachycephalic, with a C.I. of 80-85. The modal value of the N.I. is 55-60, and in this platyrrhine group 45 per cent of the instances fall. Widenmann's (1898) group of</page><page sequence="176">50 .0 o 0 cr cd CO w ?

A. Hrdlicka's catalogue (1928b, pp. 107-127) gives some measure? ments for skulls of south African Negroes, Bushmen, and Hottentots. Benington's (1911-12) series of African skulls is too small to support an argument for racial differentiation. In his introduction to this article, Pearson also points out the possibility that skulls from one area may be heterogeneous. The minimum series ought to be 100 adult crania of one sex. The male series included 50 crania from the Batetela tribe of the Congo and 50 from the Gaboon, collected in the year 1864 by Du Chaillu. A series of eighteen male skulls was acquired in Gaboon by the same explorer in 1880. Particulars are given for the groups of Zulu, Angoni and other crania (pp. 294 295), but the numbers are all small. Some general conclusions respecting the phylogenetic relationship of the samples, as revealed by the short series of measurements, are given (p. 33). The Gaboon and Congo series, despite differences, are regarded as' 'forming a fairly representative group which differs appreciably from the Kaffir Zulu group." Formulae for calculating the capacity of Negro skulls from linear dimensions are given by Tildesley (1927), Isserlis (1914), T. W. Todd (1923), and Pearson (1904). Von Bonin (1934) has com? pared the results given by these formulae. Kitson's (1931) grouping, based on the coefficients of racial likeness, leads to the conclusions expressed on pages 298 to 300 of that article: "(a) Congo, Cameroons, Gaboon, Negroes from Egypt, Galla and Somali. The first three of these are from West Africa, which is generally supposed to be the home of the true negro; the Egyptian series probably came from the Sudan; and the Galla and Somali are usually thought to be essentially 'Hamitic' in physical type. The first three, and possibly the fourth, represent Bantu-speaking peoples, but the Galla and Somali speak an Hamitic language. "(b) Kaffirs and Angoni. The physical similarity of these two southern Bantu-speaking peoples is not surprising. "(c) Tanganyika, Teita, and Hottentots. The close resemblance between the groups from Tanganyika Territory and Kenya Colony is to be expected from cultural evidence and from their geographical position, but it is surprising to find that they are linked up with the non-Bantu Hottentots, and that the last bear their closest resemblance to the Teita who are geographically further removed from them than are the peoples of Tanganyika Territory.</page><page sequence="180">I. iff 1 Fig. 29. Bedouin Arab of Tunis, North Africa. 185</page><page sequence="181">186 Source Book for African Anthropology "It must be admitted that there are several unexpected features of this classification which has been reached by purely statistical means. There is no close correspondence between the affinities of the types and their geographical positions. The Congo and Came roons series may be supposed to represent the most typical West African races, but they are connected with those of East and South Africa by the Gaboon series which came from a district 800 miles further west than that from which the Congo crania were obtained. Kenya Colony lies to the north of Tanganyika Territory, but the Teita have closer relationships to the southern Angoni and Hotten? tots, while the Tanganyika tribes resemble more closely the Negroes from Egypt and the Galla and Somali. The suggested relationships of the Hottentots would certainly not have been expected. It must be noted that the Bushman and Hottentot series are less well authen? ticated than the others, but they are clearly differentiated from each other and still more clearly from the Kaffirs. "The present classification is only claimed to be a preliminary one, and it should not be rejected merely because it does not accord closely with the generally accepted theories of the relationships of the African races. These theories have been based almost entirely on very inadequate data obtained from the living populations. The material used in the present paper is also inadequate, but the use of purely quantitative methods applied to cranial measurements, which have many advantages over those of the living, appears to offer quite the most hopeful approach for future research in this direction. The most pressing need is for more and, if possible, longer series of crania of Negroes, Bushmen, and Hottentots." Semites, Hamites, Half-Hamites When dealing with the measurements of Negroes, we were able to avoid use of the linguistic terms "Bantu" and "Sudanic" by substituting topographical terms. There appears to be no alternative to the use of the words "Semitic" and "Hamitic," which have definite linguistic and cultural connotations. We have no specific terms to express the aggregate of somatic traits associated with either the word "Semite" or "Hamite," though photographs and anthropo metric data make the distinguishing physical features perfectly clear. semites (Table 6) A glance at Figs. 29 and 30, giving front and side views of an Arab of Tunisia, make clear the main features. Hooton (1931, p. 509)</page><page sequence="182">^ ^^^^^^^^^ Fig. 30. Bedouin Arab of Tunis, North Africa. 187</page><page sequence="183">188 Source Book for African Anthropology describes Arabs as being mainly of "Mediterranean race with slight admixture of Armenoid and possibly Nordic. The nose is aquiline and very leptorrhine, with thin nasal tip, high bridge, and compressed .alae. The head form is very dolichocephalic with pro? truding occiput." This statement needs modifying, since there are two main divisions of Arabs, a dolichocephalic and a decidedly brachycephalic division. According to Hooton, the stature is medium, averaging 1650-1680 mm., and the build is slender. The color of the hair is black or dark brown, and the color of the eye the same. The skin color is olive brown. The face is elliptical, long, and narrow. The hair is wavy or curly, with medium texture. Some of the data in this general description may be verified by consulting C. G. Seligman (1917) and referring to Table 6. Seligman (1917, p. 214) states that anthropometric records of Arabs in Africa and elsewhere are few and often incomplete. This, however, was written twenty years ago and to some extent the gaps have been filled, especially for Arabia and Iraq, though the African records are still scanty. Seligman's examination of fragmentary data brings him to the conclusion that southern Arabia has a pre? dominantly brachycephalic population, while in the north there is a dolichocephalic population. Seligman then turns to a discussion of the Arabs in Africa and notes that many so-called Arabs are Arabized Berbers. Fig. 31 gives an illustration of a man who, in my opinion, illustrates the term "Arabized Berber." Arabic is his natural tongue and he is a Moham? medan, but in physical type he corresponds well with the illustrations of Berbers shown by Coon (1931), Bertholon and Chantre (1912), and Bourrilly (1932). Seligman refers to the well-known westerly incursions of Arabs who have been absorbed into a Berber popula? tion from which they probably differed little in stature and head form. In the hinterland of Tripolitania and Tunisia, however, there are many pastoral, semi-nomadic people, who are probably of predominatingly Arab blood. C. G. Seligman quotes Chantre (1904, p. 196) to show that some Egyptian Arabs (Bedouins) have average cephalic indices ranging from 72.8 to 75.4, which agrees closely with Seligman's measurements of the Arab Kababish of Kordofan. The occurrence of brachycephalic skulls in ancient graveyards of Egypt and Tripoli, among predominantly long-headed populations, may be explained by regarding these as intrusions from southern Arabia.</page><page sequence="184">Fig. 31.

Berber features. 189</page><page sequence="185">190 Source Book for African Anthropology Turning to Table 6, we have sufficient data to indicate what physical features might be expected in people of Arabized blood in Africa. For types of Tripolitania, see G. M?ller (1936). A report by H. Field (1935) shows that Arabs of Kish (396 measured) have an average stature of 1677 mm., a C.I. of 75.3, and N.I. of 61.1. They are therefore of medium stature, dolichocephalic, and leptorrhine (Fig. 71). Evidently the Arabs of south Arabia are appreciably shorter than those of Kish. They are brachycephalic according to all observers, and the groups showing the highest brachycephaly (mode 86-87) are those measured by B. Thomas (1932). The Arabs measured by Coon (1931) in northwest Africa show close agreement with Field's Kish series. The Arabs of Kish, com? pared with those of northwest Africa, have 6 mm. more in stature, are one point higher in cephalic index, and have somewhat narrower noses. A small sample (24) of Kababish have the greatest stature of our Arab samples; they are distinctly dolichocephalic, and, as might be expected, owing to long contact with Negro slaves, the N.I. is higher than that of other Arab groups. Shanklin's (1934, 1935) trans-Jordan Arabs are mesaticephalic with a modal value of C.I. 76-77 for 791 males. The details of Shanklin's distribution indicate the mingling of broad-headed and long-headed stocks. Classified according to villages, the average C.I.'s range from 74.7-78.8, and for the tribes the range of averages is 74.1-78.2. In Battara's (1934) review of the data of Aldobrandino Mochi, we have a classification of the figures relating to seventy-nine males of Eritrea and northern Abyssinia, who speak a Semitic language, Tigr?. If from the tables a frequency distribution is prepared, there is evidence that the stature is either tall or bordering on the tall class. There is a definite modal value between 1670-1730 mm., in which division 43 per cent of the individuals are classed. With regard to head form, 40.5 per cent are dolichocephalic, and 50.6 per cent are mesaticephalic; there is only one individual with an index above 80 (brachycephalic), and only five individuals have an index below 70 (sub-dolichocephalic). The N.I. very definitely shows the leptor? rhine and mesorrhine condition prevailing. Of the total sample, 43 per cent are leptorrhine, 50 per cent mesorrhine, and only 7 per cent platyrrhine. In the Semitic groups, we clearly have a people of medium stature, and sometimes in the lower ranges of medium values. There are two</page><page sequence="186">Fig. 32.

In all the groups tested, the nose is leptorrhine, but among the Kababish very close to the mesorrhine condition. We can find groups of Negroes with statures and cephalic indices similar to those of the Semites, but the narrow? ness of the nose among the Semites is a dependable distinction. hamites (northern) (Table 6) If we agree to accept the external origin of the Hamites, despite the views of Sergi (1901) and G. A. Barton (1934), who accord them an African origin, we have a picture of Hamitic incursions from south? west Asia. These incursions split into two main branches, a northern and an eastern. The illustrations of a Tuareg (Fig. 34) and of Egyptians (Fig. 35) show the features of the northern Hamitic group. Figure 37, portraying a Somali and a Hadendoa, gives an indication of the eastern Hamitic type. This type is also represented by two Amharic-speaking Abyssinians (Fig. 36). The measurements collated in Table 6 facilitate comparison of anthropometric data. Considering first the stature of the northern Hamites, the Tuareg (1725 mm.) are within the tall class, but all other groups, namely, the Berbers, are of upper medium height. The Tuareg are clearly dolicho? cephalic, with an index of 71.8, while the other groups are mesa ticephalic, with average indices ranging from 75.0-77.3. In stature and in C.I., there is no definite distinction between these groups of northern Hamites and Negroes, except that the long-headed Tuareg are more dolichocephalic than any of the Negro groups, with the exception of some of the Nilotic Negro tribes. When, however, the nasal indices of the northern Hamites are considered, a condition fundamentally different from that of any Negro tribe is observed. All the northern Hamitic groups are decidedly leptorrhine and the averages of the N.I. for the several groups are remarkably close, with a range of only 63.5-66.5. hamites (eastern) (Table 6) In turning to the consideration of eastern Hamites, there is the difficulty of classification. Seligman (1930, p. 102) points out that the Ababda, who once spoke Bedawi, which is the Hamitic language of the Bisharin and the Hadendoa, have lost their old tongue and now speak Egyptian, while the Beni Amer speak a Semitic language called Tigr?.

With the exception of the Somali groups, which are all definitely in the tall class, the eastern Hamites are of medium height, showing fairly close agreement with the Berber groups of northern Hamites. We have, according to these data, only two tall groups of Hamites, the Tuareg (northern) and the Somali (eastern). Among the eastern Hamites, head form has a definitely rounder tendency than among the northern Hamites, and this may be due to some phylo genetic relation between eastern Hamites and an ancient brachy cephalic Armenoid people. The eastern Hamites are decidedly more platyrrhine than the northern Hamites, for, glancing down the column of figures for the N.I. of the northern Hamites, all are in the 60's, whereas the nasal indices of the eastern Hamitic groups are, with the exception of two Somali groups, all in the 70's. The eastern Hamitic groups are nearly all mesorrhine; the northern Hamitic groups are all leptorrhine. The measurements made by Sergi (1912) on sixty-nine male skulls of people he describes as modern Tigr? give averages of 1501 cc. capacity, which is higher than that of most Negro tribes, a N.I. of 50.3, and a cranial index of 74.2. Adding two points to the cranial index, we have a C.I. of 76.2, in very close agreement with the indices for all the eastern Hamites quoted on Table 6. To bring the average N.I. of the skull series into form with the N.I. of the living, we may use a formula of Buxton and Thomson, discussed by Davies (1932, pp. 349-351). The formula N.I. (living) = N.I. (crania) X 2.327-38.08, when applied to the N.I. 50.3, gives N.I. 78.96, which is higher than that for the living groups considered in Table 6. On the whole, there is a close resemblance between the African Semites and the two geographical groups of Hamites. Both the northern and eastern Hamites have tall groups, but generally speak? ing, the Hamites and Semites are of medium stature. With the exception of the low dolichocephaly of the Tuareg, all the Semitic and Hamitic groups have a short range of C.I. from the higher ranges of dolichocephaly to moderate mesaticephaly. There is a difference to be observed, however, between Semites and northern Hamites on the one hand, and eastern Hamites on the other. The eastern Hamitic groups are not so leptorrhine as the northern</page><page sequence="197">202 Source Book for African Anthropology Hamites and Semites. In fact, most of our samples of eastern Hamites have average nasal indices within the mesorrhine value. half-hamites A sample of ninety-one Masai (Fig. 39) gives a tall stature of 1700 mm., a rather low C.I. of 73.2, and a definite mesorrhine con? dition which is arrestingly different from that of Negroes. The Masai have a nasal index (76.2) which shows their intermediate position between Hamites and Negroes. The N.I. is, in fact, not much higher than that of the Ababda and the Bisharin, but the index is noticeably higher than that of the northern Hamites and the Semites. Pygmies Tables 7, 8 A thorough historical survey of the Pygmy question would begin with the writings of Aristotle and Herodotus; we are, however, con? cerned here with anthropometry, for which there is one incomparable source, that of Schebesta and Lebzelter (1933). The cultural pattern of Pygmy life is dealt with in section II, where references other than those bearing on physical anthropology will be found. Our modern study of Pygmies may begin with the writings of Du Chaillu (1867, p. 317), who explored the Gaboon region in the period 1865-70. He states that the Pygmies of that area were of a dirty yellow color, their foreheads were low and narrow, their legs were short in proportion to their trunks, and their eyes had a look of unutterable wildness. The average height of six women he meas? ured was 1400 mm., which is a little taller than that given by Sche? besta for Ef? females. In the northeast Congo, the earliest observations that aroused anthropological interest were made by Schweinfurth (1874, vol. 2, pp. 140-143), Stanley (1891, vol. 1, p. 208), and W. Junker (1892, vol. 3, pp. 81-86). All these observers agree in their description of physical traits, and all remark on the simplicity of the hunting cul? ture, skill in tracking game, vivacity, adept dancing, and emotional instability. The few casual measurements are of no present impor? tance. Stanley observes that, in distinction from the Ituri Bambuti Pygmies, the Batwa have long heads, long narrow faces, and an expression that is sour, anxious, and querulous. These field observations of the period 1867-87 aroused great interest in anthropological circles, and the works of Hamy (1879), Topinard (1885), and Quatrefages (1887) resulted. In 1888 Flower measured two skeletons of the Aka Pygmies of the northeast Congo,</page><page sequence="198">Fig. 39. Masai warriors, Kenya, Half-Hamites. 203</page><page sequence="199">204 Source Book for African Anthropology and although his technique would no doubt meet with present-day criticism, his measurements are extremely valuable. The rarity of skeletal material from the African Pygmies is mentioned by Sche besta, who states that he was unable to obtain such material. H. H. Johnston (1902, vol. 2, pp. 494, 565) gives some photographs of Pygmies, together with a few anthropometric tables which show the averages of six males to be: stature, 1452 mm.; C.I., 78.7; and N.I., 109. Von Luschan (1906) describes the skin color of six Pygmies as a dull brown with a yellowish tinge. The hands and feet are delicately formed, the legs poorly developed, the eyes large and lustrous. Table 7 records the measurements supplied by von Luschan on four males and two females. The work of Czekanowski (1911, 1922) is well known for the excellence of the photographic studies and the measurements recorded. Cipriani (1933) has supplied measurements of a few Pygmies and has given photographs showing detailed struc? ture of their hands, feet, and the distribution of facial and corporal hair. Gusinde (1936) has illustrated a short article with several photographs. The Pygmy problem in its broadest sense refers, not merely to resemblances of African Pygmies inter se, but to a thesis that regards the African Pygmies, and Bushmen as well, as belonging to a Pygmy race that spread through the Andaman Islands into the Malay Peninsula, the Philippine Islands, and New Guinea. The chief exponent of this theory is P. W. Schmidt (1910). Another contributor is Von Eickstedt (1927), who gives a useful condensation of Schmidt's views. Haddon's encyclopedia summary (HERE, vol. 9, 1919, pp. 271-274) is also a succinct formulation of the theory of Pygmy dispersal. Skeletal material is rare, but Kr?mer (1906) has compared two very small Pygmy skulls from New Guinea with measurements on Bushman skulls. Reviewing Pater Schmidt's "Die Stellung der Pygm?env?lker in der Entwicklungsgeschichte des Menschen" we find that the argument is almost entirely based on cultural evidence pertaining to simple hunting communities of people of small stature. He com? pares the head form, hair, and a few obvious bodily traits, but the bulk of the work is divided between the study of material culture and the few social and spiritual facts that are known. The account deals with ornaments, clothing, food supply, shelters, itinerant life, village planning, and making fire. Bows and arrows are also studied. The review of spiritual culture includes music, art, such points of social structure as marriage, the family, and chieftainship, also</page><page sequence="200"></page><page sequence="201">206 Source Book for African Anthropology religion, mythology, and magic. A summary (pp. 280-284) states a hypothesis for origin of Pygmies in Asia whence they spread southwest and southeast. The African Pygmies represent old branches of the stem, while the Bushmen have traveled farthest and have probably departed widely from the original stock in culture, speech, and physique. A work by Trilles (1932) gives little help with anthropometry, but is a valuable survey of the social life of Congo Pygmies other than the Bambuti. The theory of Pygmy dispersal depends on a detailed study of physique and language, as well as consideration of cultural similari? ties. Now cultural similarities are bound to be numerous in hunting communities of rudimentary pattern, living in forest environment within the tropics. Even today, with the advantage of recent con? tributions to physical anthropology, we have far too little data to make a detailed comparison of widely separated Pygmy groups throughout the area of alleged dispersal. The linguistic situation also is obscure, and for African Pygmies the existence of a Pygmy language, preceding the use of present-day Bantu and Sudanic speech by Pygmy groups, has yet to be established. Therefore, though Schmidt's thesis of twenty-seven years ago may well be true, the com? parative material for demonstration is still meager. From these historical considerations we turn to the data of Schebesta and Lebzelter (1933) to extract a few quotations relating only to the physical attributes of central African Pygmies. A map (p. 7) makes the distribution of Pygmy and pygmaeform groups quite clear. Schebesta prefers the word "pygmaeform" to the term pygmoid, and instead of using the noun Pygmy as an adjective also, he employs the adjectival form pygmean. His map shows the principal Pygmy groups. In the northeast are the Ituri, Aka, Ef?, and Basua. There are Batwa groups in the east and southeast. The Bacwa Pygmies are on the mid-course of the Chuapa and Lomela tributaries of the Congo. Another group of Bacwa, sometimes called the Batembo, occupy an extensive region south of Coquilhatville. The Babinga are widely scattered between the Ubangi and Sangha rivers. Bekwi and Akoa Pygmies are located near the Ogowe River. Schebesta states that probably 25,000 Pygmies live in the Ituri region, and they are by no means on the decrease, despite high mortality of infants and young adults as a result of the strenuous forest life. The family is monogamous, and there are two living children to each married woman.</page><page sequence="202">^^^^ ^^^^^j o s CP 207</page><page sequence="203">208 Source Book for African Anthropology As an outward principle of classification Schebesta groups the northeastern Pygmies according to the languages they have adopted from surrounding Negroes. The Aka are a Sudanic linguistic group. The Basua, under which name there are many subdivisions living on the left bank of the Ituri, use an archaic Bantu speech. The Ef?, in the eastern forest region of the Ituri, are another linguistic division comprising the Mamvu, Mombutu, Balese, and Bambuba. The build of the Ituri Pygmies is heavy and clumsy, but there is no impression of stunted growth or malnutrition. The head is dis? proportionately large, the neck short, and the trunk long in propor? tion to the legs. The hands and feet are slender. In many men there is a powerful development of the thorax, and the breadth of the shoulders still further increases the appearance of disproportion. The gait is waddling and clumsy, and the toes are often turned inward. The skin color of a pure-bred Mombuti is grayish yellow, but mixture of Negro blood often gives a darker tint. The Bambuti are hirsute on face and body. Schebesta (p. 31) gives outline draw? ings of facial types, namely, the broad and the narrow. Despite the peculiarities of build one must distinctly understand that Pyg? mies are a specific human type, and not degenerative Negroes. The body odor is different from that of white people and Negroes, and must be regarded as a definite physical character of the African Pygmies. The Aka, who have felt the influence of the Mangbetu, deform the skulls of their infants by swathing the occiput. The Batwa of Kivu and Ruanda, when nomadic, resemble the true Ituri Pygmies, but the settled Batwa are taller and darker than the typical Pygmies. This modification will be discussed in more detail later when dealing with the effects of miscegenation. The Bacwa (singular Bocwa), of whom about 50,000 exist, are associated with the Nkundu Negroes. Lebzelter (p. 81) distinguishes six types of Pygmies and gives a list of the combined features distinguishing each. The purest breed is the Basua of the Babira, 82 per cent of whom are representative Pygmy types. The types are true Pygmy I, II, III; and Europoid, with narrower faces, narrower noses, and thinner lips. Other types are Negro I and II. Taking the Ef? as a representative Pygmy group, we find that the stature of males is 1430 mm., the C.I. 79.4, and the N.I. 105.7. The list of measurements (Table 7) shows considerable variation in height, and some differences of C.I. and N.I. among the Pygmy groups, but all are of short stature, high cephalic index (about 80), and either</page><page sequence="204">1 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^IK^^^^^^H 209</page><page sequence="205">210 Source Book for African Anthropology very platyrrhine or definitely hyperplatyrrhine. For the Pygmy groups Schebesta and Lebzelter (1933, p. 22) have prepared a fre? quency distribution curve, showing that all males have a modal value of stature in the class interval 1440 mm.; females 1360 mm. The curve for pygmean groups shows two modal values for males, one in the interval 1520 mm., and the other at 1640 mm.; females 1480 mm. The C.I. for all true Pygmies is 80 for males and 78 for females. Again in the pygmean groups the females are a little more dolichocephalic than the males, the respectives indices being 77 and 78. In summing up, Lebzelter states, "We may say that the Pygmies of central Africa to whom alone, according to P. Schebesta, the historical name of Pygmies should be applied, are composed in the main of one race, only the Bambuti race, with the addition of a small percentage of Negroid and European elements/9 A comparative study of physical types of Pygmies may be made by consulting Figs. 40-42, 64, 65. Khoisan People (Bushmen and Hottentots) (Table 7) Alleged physical resemblance between true Pygmies and Bush? men tribes of the Kalahari Desert, south Africa, tends to disappear when a comparison of somatic traits is made. The average height of Bushmen differs in various localities, and the fact that the average height increases in the northern and eastern regions may be attributed to mixture with taller tribes of the southern Bantu Negroes. Bushmen, whether pure or mixed, are on the aver? age taller than true Pygmies. The head form of Pygmies tends to brachycephaly, with indices 77-80, whereas Bushmen, with cranial indices of 75-76, approach a dolichocephalic condition. The nasal index for Bushmen is high, but so far as the inadequate data show, the noses of Bushmen are not so broad as those of Pygmies. Both Pygmies and Bushmen have a yellowish tinge of the skin. The cheek bones of Bushmen are prominent, so also is the jaw. The eyes are set far apart, the lips project, and often the ear-lobes are joined to the cheeks. The arms and lower limbs are short in proportion to the trunk, whereas the Negro has long arms. The hair of Bushmen (Fritsch, 1916) differs from that of other Africans on account of the formation in small, closely coiled spirals that leave the scalp visible. The growth of facial and body hair is sparse, as it is with Negroes, but not with Pygmies. A comparison of Figs. 43-47, 62, and 63 shows the build and physiognomy of Bushmen,</page><page sequence="206"></page><page sequence="207">o CO CO OS o3 a. x* X* &lt;v XI ?

H. Flower (1888) who says, 'The peculiar oblong form of the skull, its vertical forehead, straight sides, the wide flat space between the orbits, the extremely small and flat nasal bones, and the absence of prognathism at once distinguish the skull of the Bushman from that of the Akka." The physiognomy of Hottentots (Fig. 48) bears a resemblance to that of southern Bushmen, but the former are taller and there are differences in head form.

The heads of Hottentots are longer and less flattened than those of Bushmen. For seventy-three Hottentots the C.I. proved to be 72.9, which is in the lower range of dolichocephaly (Schapera, 1930, p. 61, quoting Schultze, 1928). The jaws of Hotten? tots are more Prognathie than those of the Bushmen. In both Hottentot and Bushman tribes the women show a con? dition known as steatopygia, that is, a disproportionate fattening of the buttocks, which is further emphasized by an inward curvature of the lower part of the spine.

The figures</page><page sequence="212">Physical Anthropology 217 show every possible defect?paucity of data, failure to state the number of persons measured, mingling of measurements for both sexes, and failure to make statements respecting purity of blood in the small examples chosen; but, judging from the low variability of physical traits among different groups of Hottentots, the Hotten? tot type was established at a remote period. When measurements are made among a population which represents a recent mixture, the coefficients of variability are high as a rule. But, despite mixture, there are sometimes among the original population certain entrenched physical traits which tend to stability, regardless of the physical mixture and the influence it has on other less strongly entrenched somatic traits. Apparently the bodily characters of the Hottentots have had time to settle to a fairly uniform type. Professor V. Lebzelter recorded an extensive series of measure? ments on groups of Bushmen and Hottentots, but at present the published data are insufficient for an adequate survey. The fact is astonishing that the early research of Fritsch (1872) is probably the best account we have of the physique of the Khoisan. Plate 49 (Fritsch) gives shades of skin color, and Plates 30-48 show crania and skeletal details. Tables 1-4 (Fritsch) record cranial measure? ments. The Atlas accompanying the text contains a large number of artistic woodcuts showing the physiognomy of Bushmen and Hotten? tots. For data given in Table 8, I am grateful to Dr. Hella P?ch who supplied the unpublished figures of measurements for Bushman males and females. Types of Bushmen are shown in Bantu Studies (vol. 10, No. 2, 1936). Shrubsall (1897) gives tables of measurements on the skulls of eight Hottentots and eight Bushmen. The method of testing cranial capacity, and probably other points of technique employed forty years ago, would, no doubt, be open to criticism, but the figures are among the best we have. Pittard has made a brief modern study of the craniology of the Griquas (1927) and of the Bushmen (1929), based on meager data, and he has, with Comas (1930), described the platymeric condition in Bushmen and Hottentots. Drennan (1932) has published an article on the order of eruption of permanent teeth among Bushmen. Weninger (1936) has made a comprehensive study of pigmentation of the skin in Bushman tribes. Broom's (1923) comparative study of the crania of Bushmen and Hottentots, though necessarily based on small samples, brings out some contrasts between the forms of Bushman and Hottentot skulls.</page><page sequence="213">^^^^^^.. ^feR'jcBE,^ ^ ^^^^^^^ ? ,*HHE-i s ^^^^^ . *J9?*? 3 218</page><page sequence="214">^^^^^ -L :^-6i^^B^^Hl^ 1 ^^^^^^^^^^^ ffiffifc % r g 219</page><page sequence="215">220 Source Book for African Anthropology One arresting difference is the extreme dolichocephaly of a group of Hottentot skulls from old graves at Upington. The cranial indices of male skulls were 68.8, 68.4, 64.1, and 68.4. "The Hottentot skull differs from the Bushman type, not only in being extremely doli? chocephalic but in having a much greater height measurement/' Comparison of Physical Types stature At the lowest end of the height scale are the Aka and EU Pygmies with statures of 1429 mm. and 1430 mm. respectively. Then in ascending order are groups of Pygmy foundation plus Negro blood, with average group statures ranging from near the true Pygmy level to 1609 for the Balese. For Bushmen, tribal averages of statures range from 1477-1584 mm. (Table, 8), but figures are biased by small samples and adultera? tion. The only average for Hottentots (Naman) is 1624 mm. These measurements fall within the classification of short statures. The averages for Negroes of the western, central, eastern, and southern groups are mainly medium (1580-1680 mm.). But some Negro tribes are exceptions, since they fall in the tall class (1680 1720 mm). Among western Negroes the tall people are the Kabila, Pepel, Ekoi, Hausa (just within the tall category), the Mossi, and the Lobi. Central Negro averages, with the exception of those for the Bushongo and the Azande (1747 mm. and 1701 mm. respectively), are all medium. In east Africa the only tall groups are a Mozambique sample (1686 mm.) and the Landins (1686 mm.); these are, however, only just within the tall category. The Baganda come close to the low limit of the tall group. South Africa has tall Zulu and Batonga groups, while the Bavenda are just outside the tall category. In Angola the Vachokue, Luena, Valuchazi, and Ovimbundu must all be classed as tall. Nilotic Negroes are all decidedly within the tall category; there are no border-line averages. Some groups have averages of more than 1720 mm. and must therefore be classed as very tall. The stature is lowest throughout the Congo region, so far as the averages for scattered tribes can be trusted. The Semites, with the exception of the Kababish (1709 mm.), are of medium height, and in the medium category most of the Hamitic groups have to be classified, with the exception of the</page><page sequence="216">?a 8 03 s CO I o ?g 3 I Pn o g o a o O 1" 221</page><page sequence="217">222 Source Book for African Anthropology Tuareg (1725 mm.) and the Rif (1686 mm.). In the eastern Hamitic groups only the Somali are tall; the range of the averages of four Somali samples extends from 1707-1740 mm. head form The Pygmy and pygmean groups have a rounded head form in the higher ranges of mesaticephaly, or actually above the 80 line of demarcation. Higher mesaticephaly of about 78 is common in the central African region, and this fact, combined with the somewhat lower ranges of medium stature in that region, lends support to a theory of wide dissemination of Pygmy groups and their mingling with Negroes. The tribal averages for C. I. of Bushmen range from 74-77 (Table 8). For the main part the cranial indices of Negroes, no matter what their geographical situation may be, is in the higher ranges of dolicho cephaly or in the lower ranges of mesaticephaly; generally the aver? ages are in the class interval 74-77. There is remarkable uniformity, except that the Nilotic Negroes definitely show a lower dolichocephaly than the other divisions of Negroes. Except for the brachycephaly of southern Arabia, which may have had some effect on African head forms, the Semitic groups have cephalic indices which differ little from the general trend of most Negro groups, and the same may be said of the cephalic indices of eastern Hamites. But the Tuareg (northern Hamites) are definitely long-headed. Together with Hottentots and Nilotic Negroes, the Taureg form a group in the ranges of low dolichocephaly (C. 1.71-73). nose The formation of the nose as expressed by the nasal index offers a distinction better than that afforded by either stature or head form. Pygmies are definitely hyperplatyrrhine and Negroes platyr rhine. The Semites and Hamites are definitely leptorrhine, with the exception of the Ababda, Bisharin, Hadendoa, and Beni Amer, whose noses are just broad enough to bring them within the mesorrhine category. A few Negro tribes of northeast Africa, namely, the Baganda, Akamba, and Akikuyu, show a reduction of the platyrrhine condition which is characteristic of Negroes, especially the far western groups. Hamitic blood probably affected this trait, for in the Hamiticized Masai the nasal index is distinctly mesorrhine (76.2). In considering the value of stature, head form, and shape of nose as distinguishing criteria, we have to recognize that there is much</page><page sequence="218"></page><page sequence="219">224 Source Book for African Anthropology overlapping of groups. In extreme cases such as those of Pygmies and Nilotic Negroes, the factor of height marks off the groups in a decisive way, and some other groups are isolated by the height factor in unmistakable manner, but many Negro, Hamitic, and Semitic groups show similar averages. The same may be said of head form with the exception already noted. There is, however, a very definite value in the nasal index as a criterion for establishing somatic group differences. We do not find, for example, that any of the average nasal indices given for Hamites and Semites could be confounded with those for Negroes; there is no overlapping of values as there is when comparing average statures and average cranial indices. Yet with more measurements, taken according to approved technique by people who were agreed on what they wanted to measure, the coefficient of racial likeness (C.R.L.) would be a valu? able mathematical way of giving precision to our ideas of difference and resemblance (Pearson, 1926; and in simpler form Kitson, 1931, p. 296; and G. von Bonin, 1931, p. 253). Anthropometric data from Africa seldom satisfy the conditions for a legitimate use of the C.R.L., but perhaps in future there will be the possibility of comparing major groups and subgroups within each of the major groups, with a view to establishing a graded series of coefficients showing the degree of group similarity or divergence with respect to a large number of traits. Let us suppose that we have two groups, A and B, under com? parison, and that the C.R.L. of A and B is required. Let it further be assumed that for both the A and B groups we have an adequate number of observations giving reliable averages for stature, head length, head breadth, height of nose, breadth of nose, bizygomatic width, height of face, cephalic index, nasal index, and face index. Let a?j be the averages for these traits in the A group, and a'?j' the averages for the same traits in the B group. Let A?J be the number of observations in the A group and A'?J' the number of observations in the B group. We then require &lt;t (standard deviation) of traits a?j for any reliable series. Then alpha = ) 2 x ? Alpha is required for each pair of traits. m r&gt; t c alpha a alpha b ? alpha j 1 ck. Lt. = o -Jq- ?l. A close correlation of C.R.L. is expressed by a number less than 3. There is not much to be gained by working out one or two coefficients. The figures we have collated (Tables 1-8) and the photographs show that Pygmy groups are bound to give a low cor? relation with Tuareg, and that a high correlation is likely to exist</page><page sequence="220">1 I 225</page><page sequence="221">226 Source Book for African Anthropology between subdivisions of Bushmen. But with adequate data we could establish as a datum line a series of coefficients for the most diverse groups, then proceed to compare the similar groups. In this way we could formulate concepts of likeness and divergence that are now so vague because they are based on pictorial study and insufficient data. Such use of the C.R.L. has, however, been recently criticized by R. A. Fisher (1936), but his judgment is by no means final. Human Origins and Migrations paleontology In the preceding pages consideration has been given to the physical types inhabiting Africa at the present day. But the broader question of the origin, miscegenation, and dispersal of these different branches of the human stock was postponed because of the many theories that are involved. Discussion of the prehistory of Africa (chap. Ill) included a summary of the types of fossil anthropoids and fossilized human bones that African soil has contributed to the total paleontological evidence. To summarize the whole of the geological and paleon? tological testimony is beyond the scope of this work, but a short course of reading will lead to the point where consideration of the dispersal of Homo sapiens can begin. Duckworth's (1911) "Prehistoric Man," and Buttel-Reepen's (1913) "Man and His Forerunners" were excellent elementary textbooks in their day, and they are still useful for their summary of the discoveries of fossil man up to the time of publication. But during the past twenty years much new evidence has come to light concerning the dispersal of ancient anthropoid and early human types. In particular, the Neanderthal type of man has been shown to exist far east from the original European site of discovery. The paleontological evidence, as it stands today, may be gleaned from Keith (1929, 1931) and G. Elliot Smith (1931). W. K. Gregory (1934) has a work of a different type, for he is not concerned with summarizing the discoveries but in arguing against the thesis of Professor Frederick Wood Jones that "man has been derived, not from any early ape at all, but from a far older and long-extinct branch of Primates; man is distinctly related to the Spectral Tarsier of Borneo and the Philippines." A brief summary of the paleontological evidence for the origin and dispersal of anthropoid ancestors and man is given by Hooton (1931) in an informative chapter entitled "Fossil Ancestors." The evidence</page><page sequence="222">Physical Anthropology 227 is elsewhere summarized by Hooton (1927) in an article ''Where Did Man Originate?" There he favors Africa as the probable home of the Primates. But later (1931, p. 297) he states that discoveries near Pekin in 1929 and 1930 call for a revision of opinion. dispersal of physical types As an introduction to this subject Haddon's (1911) 'The Wander? ings of Peoples" will serve admirably, since the text gives a con? densed account of a great field of literature, and several clear maps are provided. But for perusal of current theories more advanced works must be consulted. Professor Griffith Taylor (1930) has propounded a theory of human origins and migrations, and in a later contribution (1936, p. 367) he has given a bibliography of his writings on this subject. In this modern study of anthropogeography Taylor has followed a method adopted by distinguished zoologists and botanists, who have worked from a center of origin and differentiation to a periphery to which, ex hypothesi, the oldest and most primitive types have been pushed. Applying the general biological technique, including study of forms and natural corridors for expansion, the conclusion is that all dominant movements of mankind were centrifugal from central Asia. And, according to Taylor (1930, p. 36) the occurrence of a primitive anthropoid or human skull in a peripheral region tells us where not to look for the cradle land of man. According to the scheme, migration of man to the Americas was blocked for a long time by adverse climatic conditions, so that internal pressure forced the migrations west and southwest into Europe and Africa, also east and southeast into Asia and Australia. The rise of physical types in the central region may have been due to physiological changes in the endocrine glands, as a result of changing climates following the alternating advance and retreat of the north polar ice cap. This recognition of climatic change as a dynamic factor in producing human movement corresponds with the theory set forth in Huntington^ work, "The Pulse of Asia." Following to some extent the teaching of Biasutti (1912), and reproducing some of that author's maps, G. Taylor (1930, p. 41) plots out a series of zones in the Old World surrounding the south center of Asia. Taking skull breadth and hair texture as criteria, the zones lead from a peripheral distribution of frizzly-haired, narrow skulls, through an area of wavy-haired skulls of intermediate breadth, to a central area of straight-haired, broad skulls.</page><page sequence="223">228 Source Book for African Anthropology In applying the theory to Africa, Taylor is of the opinion that Pygmies and Negritos are derived from an early human stock, pos? sibly the earliest migrants, who followed, as it were, a biological cul-de-sac that led to no further phylogenic development. Another early branch from the phylogenetic tree is thought to have been somewhat like Neanderthal man, and this experiment gave rise to Negroid and Australoid types. The Mediterranean and Alpine types evolved later. So far as Africa is concerned, the theory represents the Pygmies and the Bushmen as the earliest immigrants. Then followed the true Negro as exemplified by western Negroes of the present day. The Hamites and Semites are perhaps lateral branches of the Mediter? ranean stock. Possibly the Bantu Negroes came as a migration from Asia long after the first arrival of true Negroes, or the Bantu may have arisen as a result of Negro and Hamitic mixture, in the region of the Great Lakes of Africa, whence they spread westward and southward. Professor G. Taylor follows very closely to the teaching of Haddon (1911, p. 1), who states that a "migration is caused by an expulsion and an attraction, the former nearly always resulting from dearth of food, or from over-population, which practically come to the same thing." Taylor's "corridors," leading to the margins of habitable land, are what Haddon (1911, p. 5) calls "channels." Movements of men take the line of least resistance, but the word "barrier" is of relative meaning and few obstacles are completely prohibitive. Yet the picture of successive waves of migration should not be simplified too much, since the process involved much over? taking and the leaving of isolated "islands," as well as miscegena? tion and obliteration. Keith (preface to H. Field, 1935, p. 75) contributes to this con? cept of migrations from Asia by reminding us of the present belt of darkly pigmented peoples which extends across the Old World. At one extreme of this "black belt" are the Negroes of Africa, at the other end the Negroes of the Pacific (Melanesians), and midway between are the brown peoples of India. Keith further pictures two areas of human origin to the north of this "black belt," one a Mon? golian center and the other Caucasian. The Mongol stock at times broke into the "black belt" and spread into the Pacific. This would account for a Mongoloid appearance of some Polynesians (Guide to Races of Mankind, British Museum, 1921, p. 20, Fig. 4). Keith does not say so, but I think his suggestion accounts for a Mongoloid</page><page sequence="224">Physical Anthropology 229 appearance in some African people. Some Bushmen and Hottentots have such an appearance as a result of their Mongoloid eyes and high cheek bones. Meek (1925, vol. 2, p. 165) refers to a Mongoloid appearance of many Jukun and Nupe of Nigeria. C. G. and B. Z. Seligman (1932, p. 20) show men of the Mahdi and Bari tribes, with what are called pseudo-Mongoloid characters in their physiognomy. The Asiatic theory we have so briefly glanced at is simple com? pared with that of Montandon (1928), who speaks of ologenisme, which is a hypothesis accounting for the origin and dispersal of man. Montandon (p. 210) states that 'Tolog&amp;iisme est un monog&amp;iisme et un monophyletisme ubiquitaine," meaning, I take it, that the theory combines ideas of a simple origin of man, and a sending off of single lateral branches as the main trend of evolution continues. Mon tandon's diagram begins with Homo sapiens, who as a first effort throws off the "pygmoides," then advances, and at an unknown time and place the ^tasmanoide" branch is ejected. Then follow at intervals the "negroide," "armenoide," "esquimoide," and "mon goloide," while the main stem continues triumphantly to the pro? duction of the "grand race europoide." The doctrine of ologenisme is said to absorb the two older theories of monogenesis and poly genesis of man. Montandon illustrates these theories with maps, and compares the process to the opening of a hand from which fingers shoot out in all directions. Ologenisme, on the contrary, is the gradual closing of the hand, a condensing toward a center. But the diagram (Montandon, Map 13), showing how people originated and dispersed according to the theory of ologenisme, attempts to show so much that I fear the chart defeats its own purpose. If we do not allow our imagination to be too cramped by the physical argument, but take into consideration the spread of cultures and languages as well as somatic types, then there will be, I believe, a strong predilection toward the concept of an outward spread of succeeding waves from central Asia. The genesis of these somatic waves and their miscegenation leads to consideration of certain data from the fields of genetics, anthropometry, physiological observa? tions including tests of blood groups, and environmental factors that are usually compounded under the term anthropogeography. the concept of race The word "race" has been much abused in an attempt to define some obvious somatic differences, and the present disrepute of the term as one unfit for scientific nomenclature was indicated at the</page><page sequence="225">230 Source Book for African Anthropology meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, 1936. All are agreed that no single somatic trait can be taken as a criterion of race, but there is no agreement respecting the combina? tion of physical traits that may be fairly regarded as demarcating one so-called "race" from another. From one major somatic group to another there are infinite gradations, involving a mingling of physical factors, and so producing multiple types that are undefined except by such loose terms as Mongoloid, Pygmoid, Negroid, Cau casoid, Australoid. Professor Garth (1931, p. 221), at the conclusion of his extensive studies in race psychology, states that the idea of "race" as some? thing permanent "becomes an artificial notion, a myth. What we call races are merely temporary eddies in the history of human kind." Despite the misuse of the term "race" biologically, linguistically, geographically, and sometimes with direct social and religious opprobrium, the physical anthropologist cannot afford to despair of finding some terms that adequately describe and demarcate an aggregation of physical traits. Hooton (1931, p. 397) states that "racial classification must be made upon the basis of a sum total of significant morphological and metrical features, according to the distinct variations of such features in large human groups." Hooton clarifies the desired process of classification by pointing out three major groups of somatic traits; these in his opinion have a claim to consideration as determinants in a scheme of human taxonomy. Of these groups of traits the first is the most important, since the factors are what might be called entrenched features. These traits, according to Hooton, tend to intensify themselves by the inertia of heredity. Such traits are the form, color, and quantity of the hair and its distribution in tracts; the color of the eyes and the form of the skin-folds oi the eyelids. Another trait of like kind is the breadth of the head relative to the length. In the second group are bodily characters which may have originated in functional modifications, but such traits have become stabilized, and they tend to persist even after they have ceased to serve the biological purpose and conditions to which their origin was due. Among such traits are pigmentation of the skin, height and breadth of the nose, and height of the head. A third and taxonomically less important group of factors which are easily modified by environment (including nutrition, gait, and</page><page sequence="226">Physical Anthropology 231 occupation) are stature, weight, proportions of the hand, and the shape of the femur and tibia. To understand the discriminating value of these factors it is necessary to consider biological data having a direct bearing on the origin of somatic traits, their transmission, and persistence. differentiation Under this general heading the factors which are responsible for the origin of somatic traits and their transmission can be grouped. Some account can be given of the attempts that have been made toward definite measurement of the mechanism of heredity, and the results of hybridization can be studied by means of anthropometric measurements and physiological tests, including study of blood groups. Environment, too, is a factor that has to be considered in relation to the differentiation of types. There is no intention of dealing adequately here with these controversial subjects, but the factors should be mentioned to show the great complexity of our specific problem of accounting for the origin of physical types living in Africa today. Simple textbooks dealing with the subject of genetics will explain what is known today of the mechanism of heredity, and though the powers of the microscope are far too feeble to confirm the hypothetical function of genes and ids, the function of chromosomes in cell divi? sion and transmission of physical characters is fairly well understood, since chromosomes can actually be observed during process of cell division. Two simple textbooks, Gates (1930) and Hurst (1935), will serve to explain the biological mechanism which is responsible for preserving unchanged, or for mingling traits during fertilization. Hurst explains that the gene is the primary organizer and determiner of all structural and functional characters in living organisms. In a human being there are forty-eight groups of genes known as chromosomes, twenty-four of which are directly derived from the egg cell of the mother parent, and twenty-four from the sperm cell of the father. Hurst shows how recent experiment has explained the nature of evolutionary change. Under X-ray treat? ment two main types of alteration occur in the gene complex. These may be distinguished as (1) mutations, which are changes within the genes themselves, and (2) new distribution of chromosomes or parts of chromosomes which produce transmutations. From the time of Lamarck (1744-1829) and Darwin (1809-1882) biological argument has been focused on the subject of evolutionary change. Use and disuse of organs, the rise of small variations, and</page><page sequence="227">232 Source Book for African Anthropology the perpetuation of some of these by natural selection, for a long time held the field as explanations of the rise of new species. In the middle of the last century Mendel worked out a scheme of the transmission of characters in peas, and finally the mechanism of this transmission has been explained by observation of the chromosomes and by hypotheses relating to genes within the chromosomes. How do these biological facts and hypotheses apply to the rise and per? petuation of different physical traits that mark off the varieties of mankind? And how shall such differences be accurately measured? environment The belief that some environmental conditions can bring about the rise of new varieties seems to be well founded in laboratory experiments, known sometimes as experimental evolution. No doubt, much of the knowledge so obtained can be applied to explain? ing the physical differences of man. To speak of a mutation as a "spontaneous" change in the germ plasm merely shelves the problem. What is the cause of the change? At present no satisfactory answer can be given, but J. R. de la H. Marett (1935) has summarized hypotheses relating to the biologi? cal and psychological effects of all kinds of environmental conditions. The endocrine hypothesis set forth by Keith in his presidential address to the British Association (1919) is examined, and con? sideration is given to the thesis that mineral deficiencies of the soil, and the resulting vegetable food, have influenced animal and human evolution. According to hypothesis many external factors may have affected the genes, and perhaps the cytoplasm of the cell as well, in order to produce those changes that give rise to new physical char? acters. Marett's argument has been discussed by Gates (1936). Bolk (1929) has further explained Keith's endocrine gland theory, and has advanced his own beliefs that some pronounced physical differences in mankind result from the fetal preservation of certain ancient and elementary characters. Of the actual measurement of bodily change due to the operation of environmental factors we have two notable examples. Both the traits studied have generally been regarded as major distinctions of different human types. Thomson and Buxton (1923) studied man's nasal index in re? lation to climatic conditions and concluded that a platyrrhine nasal index is associated with a hot, moist climate, and a leptorrhine nasal index with a cold, dry climate. The later work of Davies (1932) in</page><page sequence="228">Physical Anthropology 233 the main confirmed these conclusions. Boas (1912) has conveniently summarized his longer reports on changes in the bodily form of descendants of immigrants. The conclusions were assailed by several critics. Pearson and Tippet (1924) prepared an article on "Stability of the Cephalic Indices Within the Race," which led to the conclusion that the authors were unable to find any change of real significance in the cephalic indices for school children from five to twenty years of age. And "having regard to the fact that extraordinary environ? mental differences in this country (England) appear to make no significant change in the shape of the head, it is very difficult to accept Professor Boas' view that the child born to Jewish parents in Europe differs in head shape from the child born to the same parents after their arrival in America." The details of this controversy are discussed by Hooton (1931, p. 408). G. Taylor (1936, p. 352) points out several reasons, support? ing the opinion of Boas himself, why the changes in cephalic index, when slight and non-continuous, do not invalidate the index as a criterion of human varieties. Hirsch (1927, p. 89) concludes his measurements by offering the hypothesis that head length and head width are in great part determined by psychological factors operating by means of the ductless glands. Factors such as fear and anxiety exercise an influence on the glands, but when these factors are removed the relative glandular secretion is modified and a change in the cephalic index occurs. hybridization The effects of hybridization in Africa are plainly evident in a study of photographs of physical types from the continent, and later some consideration will be given to anthropometric evidence of hybridization, a subject we touched rather briefly in presenting data relating to the nasal index among Hamites and Negroes. For modern and instructive data relating to hybridization reference must be made, not to observations on African Negroes, but to comparative studies of the colored and white populations of America. The best of these studies have been published in the past ten years. Hooton (1926) reported on the study of race mixture with special reference to the work carried on at Harvard University. The studies included measurements and other observations of hybrid Hawaiian Chinese and Hawaiian-European. The former hybrid is intermedi? ate in stature, and there is a clear dominance of the brachycephaly and straight hair of the Chinese. In the first-generation hybrids,</page><page sequence="229">234 Source Book for African Anthropology resulting from crosses with Europeans, the darker Polynesian pig? ment is dominant, and the more finely cut European features tend to assert themselves. Reference has been made to the inquiries of T. W. Todd (1928, 1929) and Todd and Tracy (1931) into somatic features of the Ameri? can Negro and the stability of these traits during hybridization with the white people. Hrdlicka (1928) indicates the main traits of the full-blooded American Negro. Very comprehensive studies of racial crossing in Jamaica have been published by Steggerda (1928) and by Davenport and Steggerda (1929). The contributions of Hersko vits (1928, 1930a) have been particularly helpful from the African? isms point of view, for the social factors determining mating in American Negro groups have operated strongly in some African societies. It is possible greatly to underestimate the force of social customs and the prevalence of sociobiological standards in human mating. In Africa, for example, males of the ruling castes of Tuareg of Asben may have concubines of Negro origin. But, because of the reckoning of descent through the mother, it is difficult for even an influential man of noble caste to regard his son by such a mother as belonging to his own noble ancestry. Students of anthropology are all familiar with the regulation of marriage by caste in India, and by a great variety of exogamic laws in many parts of the world. Endogamy too is sometimes enforced by topography as well as by social sanction, but the effects of social restrictions on determining physical types and perpetuating them have not been adequately studied. An attempt has been made, Brownlee (1911), to analyze physical mixtures into their original elements by use of the Mendelian formula. Quantitative and Qualitative Differences Although it is impossible to frame a logical definition of race in terms of physique, there is no difficulty in getting a mental picture of the combined attributes which have hitherto roughly served to distinguish the principal varieties of mankind. And with further practice many subdivisions can be distinguished by inspection of photographs. Such a general knowledge, combined with definite measurable data, may be obtained from Haddon (1925) or from M. Schmidt (1926), both of whom made a world-wide and pictorial survey of the principal types of man. The nomenclature is, however, more troublesome, and ignorance of the physical type has to be con? cealed under such terms as pre-Hamite and proto-Hamite for Africa, while for South America the names of broad linguistic</page><page sequence="230">Physical Anthropology 235 divisions are often used. Nevertheless, definite advance has been made in qualitative and quantitative measurements by means of physiological and anthropometric methods. anatomy In superficial anatomy as in splanchnology an enormous amount of research remains in the field of comparative study. Expeditionary observers usually note some of the more obvious anatomical differences, but only a limited amount of material is available in dissecting rooms. Recent detailed examination of the anatomy of the foot among south African natives is an example of the anatomical work that needs to be done (Wells, 1931). The following quotation shows how productive such work may be in helping to establish physical criteria: "The foot of the South African native differs from that of the European in a large number of points, which affect the whole of its structure and are reflected in its action. "The sole of the foot, which in the European is hollow, in the Bantu is flat, with a greatly thickened epidermis and a dense pad of subcutaneous fatty tissue filling up the concavity. The muscular system of the Bantu foot is highly variable, with a tendency to a more primitive type of organization than is seen in the European. Certain muscles, however, are much more constant in the Bantu than in the European. These invariably show a primitive formation. The main blood vessels are very variable, whereas the nerves are remark? ably constant. The ligamentous system also is on the whole very constant. "The bones of the Bantu foot show consistent differences from those of the European foot, and these are further exaggerated in the foot of the Bushman. In this last race the talus and calcaneus are more ape-like than in Neanderthal man. As a result of the dif? ferences in the individual bones, the architecture of the foot is different in the three races, the Bantu and Bushman having a less perfect arch system than the European. In association with these features, the feet of the African races are less rigidly constructed than those of the European, and retain traces of a former prehensile character." anthropometry The pages of "Biometrika" and similar journals give evidence of considerable research on skeletal material, but the samples are usually small and the facts established are meager in relation to the</page><page sequence="231">236 Source Book for African Anthropology unsolved problems. With regard to measurements on living sub? jects, the scanty data we gleaned from African sources show how little systematic work has been accomplished in such a vast area. physiology The contributions of physiologists to the study of human dif? ferences are not numerous when considered in relation to the great field of research, but some advance has been made. Benedict (1932) has reported the progress made in studying the basal metabolism of the Maya, who show a metabolism of 5.2 per cent to 8.4 per cent above that of white men. This high metabolism is combined with a phenomenally low pulse rate. In Madras twenty-seven female Tamils had a metabolism on the average 17.4 per cent below that of American women. A group of forty pure-blooded aboriginals of South Australia showed definite minus value in metabolism when compared with white men. The racial effect on metabolism may be complicated by the factors of climate and diet. "The climate in southern India and the climate in Yucatan, however, are not so strikingly dissimilar as to suggest that climate can play a dominant role in these marked differences in metabolism." Such work on metabolism is extremely important, not only for the improvement of our knowledge of physiological differences among human types, but for the scientific study of diets which has just aroused the interests of African ethnologists ("Africa," vol. 9, No. 2, 1936, many contributors). A contribution of Suk (1927, pp. 31-64) is a further illustration of the kind of physiological research that is needed to demonstrate differences and similarities between groups that have been vaguely classed as races or subraces. The research was carried out among Negroes of Natal and Zululand. Many lines of inquiry were under? taken, including observations of pulse, respiration, and temperature, and the investigator takes due cognizance of psychological factors that might affect the results. The pulse rates are close to those of white men, and investigation of this phenomenon is an apt illustra? tion of the careful technique which has to be followed in such inquiry. Pulse rate varies with sex, stature, posture, and time of day. The frequency of respiration has variations with age and sex, but the differences for the south African Negroes as compared with white men and North American Indians are not great. Observations were made on skin color?which is lighter in females?on menstruation, development of breasts, and many other factors.</page><page sequence="232">Physical Anthropology 237 blood groups Recent advances have been made in testing blood groups, with a view to establishing both a qualitative and quantitative measure? ment of differences that have hitherto been called racial. The nature of these investigations may be illustrated by referring firstly to some general literature, then to specific inquiries, including obser? vations on Africans. A simple explanation of the technique and terms used is given by M. Young (1928), and notes on the historical aspect are added. Based on agglutinative reactions, bloods are divided into groups 0, A, B, AB. Bloods of the 0 division are those whose red cells carry neither of the agglutinative factors (agglutinogens). A bloods carry the A agglutinogen only, B bloods carry the B factor, and AB bloods have the two agglutinogens A and B. Anthropological interest in blood grouping goes back to the year 1919 when L. and H. Hirschfeld found that the proportion of agglu? tinogen A predominated greatly over B in European peoples, but B predominated over A in Asia and Africa. Inhabitants of these regions were classified on the basis of a biochemical index or racial index which is the ratio of the percentage of the A factor to the percentage of the B factor (%A + %AB / %B + %AB). This procedure gave three groups of people: Europeans with an index higher than 2.5. Intermediate between 1.3 and 1.8. Asio-African less than 1.0. Later work showed that these divisions were arbitrary and many intermediate values of the index occurred. The factors A and B are inherited in a typically Mendelian manner. Millot (1935) deals with the subject of agglutinogens in the anthropoid apes. He also gives data for blood-grouping tests in Europe that seem to be consistent with generally accepted ideas of consanguinity. Germans of Hungary react like those of Germany. Gypsies of Hungary are of the Hindu blood type; Hungarians are like Turks. Millot refers to the fact that pure-blooded Indians of North America are of the 0 group, and he asks whether they have lost the A and B factors, or whether separation from Mongoloid stock took place before the A and B factors had arisen by mutation. The statement is made that Australian aborigines have group A but not B. Present-day discussion often refers to the work of Snyder (1926); this is a technical article with a large bibliography. Snyder gives</page><page sequence="233">238 Source Book for African Anthropology the following groups according to blood tests: European, Indo Manehurian, Hunan, Intermediate, Africo-Malaysian, Pacific American, and Australian. He gives a map (p. 255) showing the distribution of these types. Kroeber (1934) adopted a plotting device to show the strength of the 0 factor on one axis and the A to B relation on another axis. He concluded that the current race classification would encounter about as many exceptions as corroborations of its scheme from blood type classification. Kroeber also remarks that if the A and B factors are mutations, it seems likely they arose independently in more than one place, period, and population. Wyman and Boyd (1935, pp. 182, 185) explain that in human blood cells there are two other factors, M and N, which are inherited in Mendelian fashion like A and B, except that the two cannot be absent, though one only or two to? gether can be present. Wyman and Boyd present two maps for showing the percentage distribution of the genes for A and B, respec? tively. An explanation (p. 186) is given to show how the frequencies are calculated. These maps are of interest in the study of blood groups in Africa. Map 1 indicates a line passing along north Africa and through north Arabia into central Asia, and a second line extends through the Sudan Negro belt, right across Africa at about 10? N. Lat. This line passes through northern India, then turns south through the Malay Peninsula. Map 2 indicates two north African lines, one of which passes from south to north through Italy to Scandinavia and beyond. The other north African line is plotted along the entire northern littoral of Africa into north Arabia, then due north into Scandinavia. A line is plotted from south Africa across the Indian Ocean into Mela? nesia. Yet another line extends from central Africa through south Arabia, touches the north of Madagascar and then extends to Borneo. These lines indicating similarities of reaction for the A and B factors, respectively, do bear some resemblance to the lines of hypothetical migrations between Asia and Africa as shown, for example, in Had? don (1911, Maps I and III). In addition to these general articles dealing with the main facts of experiments in blood grouping, there are many papers dealing with specific areas. Gates (1934) has written on the subject of blood groups of Indians in British Columbia. Bijlmer (1935) has supplied some particulars of blood groups in the southwest Pacific. Field (1935, p. 460) quoting the researches of MacFarlane and Kennedy</page><page sequence="234">Physical Anthropology 239 with blood samples collected by a Field Museum expedition in 1934, gives the 0, A, B, and AB factors for Arabs and other peoples. The authors quoted give bibliographies which lead out into a very exten? sive body of literature. For beginning a study of the work done on blood groups in Africa the summary of E. W. Smith (1935, p. 42) is a useful starting point, and the bibliography given there names the principal contributions to the subject. Other articles that give a digest of the main points are Elsdon-Dew (1934), Parr (1931), and Pijper (1930). Parr's article gives a clear explanation of the Wellisch (1927) p.q.r. formula and the method of plotting the values of these terms. The frequen? cies of A, B, 0 are p, q, r, respectively. Parr states (p. 26) that studies of blood types of Egyptians show them to be unlike Arabs of western Asia and parts of north Africa. The original Egyptian strain seems to persist physically despite Arab conquest and occu? pation. That the experiments with Egyptians should indicate Mongol or Indo-Manchurian relationship is not explained. Two of the most valuable tables for giving considerable informa? tion in small compass are those of Elsdon-Dew (1934) and Pijper (1930). Often, as in dealing with anthropometric measurement, the results are based on samples too small to be reliable, but, on the contrary, several results are derived from examination of more than the five hundred individuals considered necessary as a representation of the group. The indices for Negroes of Senegal, and for the Yoruba are 0.8 and 0.9, respectively, and for Negroes of the Belgian Congo the index is the same as that for the Yoruba. For American Negroes the index is 1.3, the high index being due to an admixture of white blood. The Bushmen, with a high 0 value, a low B value, and an index of 2.5, occupy a peculiar position in the blood-grouping scale. The high value for 0 leads to the suggestion that the Bushmen are the earliest African inhabitants, and Jadin's table (1936, p. 183) shows the Bushman index to be far removed from that of the Ituri Pygmies. Moreover, the B element in Bushmen is small compared with that of Pygmies. Pijper (1930, p. 314) finds the rather high index of the southeastern Bantu difficult to explain. The index is 1.3, which is the same as that for American Negroes, though there was no mixture of white blood with the Bantu samples examined. Pijper asks whether the Bantu have to be regarded as direct descendants of Hamites with a slight admixture of Negro blood. There appears to be no Hamitic index for comparison, and at present there is no</page><page sequence="235">240 Source Book for African Anthropology satisfactory explanation of the fact that the index for the south? eastern Bantu is 1.3 while that of other Negroes (Senegalese, Yoruba, Belgian Congo, French Congo) varies from only 0.8 to 1.0. The tests are of definite value, however, in showing a reliable series of distinctive 0, A, B, and AB values and a characteristic index for Pygmies, also a specific series for Bushmen, as well as for Negroes. The tests (Jadin, 1936) were successful in distinguishing Ituri Pygmies of pure blood from those having a mixture of Bantu Negro blood. All writers agree that in such tests we have something of definite value as a criterion of physical type, but at present the phylogenetic implications are not well understood. African Migrations and Mixtures A study of prehistory (chap. Ill) summarized the small amount of information available respecting fossil man in Africa. The section dealing with stone implements showed that Paleolithic man had a wide distribution far back in the Pleistocene, and considerable evidence was adduced to indicate that new immigrants introduced new stone-age cultures, which they distributed extensively. But for the main part of the continent little is known of the physique of these wanderers, and the discussion of migrations is carried on in terms of stone-age culture. With regard to present-day types, photography, anthropometry, and blood group tests are of service in establishing the presence of some distinct physical types of unknown history and phylogeny, and some plausible theories of origin and migration are advanced. But despite all this research anthropology can give no certain answers concerning the peopling of Africa, and the following summary is largely conjectural. Pygmies and the Khoisan.?In the absence of a better theory we have still to accept the idea of central or southwest Asia as a bio? logical laboratory and center of dispersal. The hypothesis has con? siderable support from paleontology, study of somatic types, and distribution of languages and cultures. According to this theory the Pygmies of central Africa must be regarded as a southwest migration of a stock which was one of nature's early experiments in differentiation. The picture of a tree trunk representing human stock is familiar, and from this primary stem lateral branches were thrown off at intervals. But when the diagram is drawn we do not know whether to sketch a branch depicting Negroes sending off lateral branches representing Pygmies</page><page sequence="236">Physical Anthropology 241 and Bushmen, or whether to show these distinct types as arising directly and independently from the parent stem. Another possi? bility arises, for the Pygmies can be represented as an early direct branch, issuing from the parent stem before Negroes were produced, and later giving rise to the Bushmen. In brief, the phylogenetic relationship of Negroes, Pygmies, and Bushmen is unknown. That the Pygmies were an early and widely distributed African people is attested in several ways. Dr. A. Werner (1925, vol. 7, pp. 258-269) has collated legendary evidence from many central and eastern African tribes to show how widely spread are stories relating to the "little people." Further research, for example, that of Jacquier (1935) tends to extend the area over which Pygmy tribes once roamed. Stannus (1915) discusses some east African legends of Pygmies; so also does Schweiger. Moreover, the scattered groups of extant Pygmies, and crosses between Pygmies and Negroes, are proof of an extensive distribution in the central forest area. Anthropometry, as well as blood-group tests and general appearance indicate that Pygmies differ appreciably from Bushmen, whose blood-grouping factors are very unlike those of any other African people. Hirschberg (1934) has made a brief comparative study of Bushmen and Pygmies in which he has examined the validity of hypotheses with regard to their phylogenetic and cultural relationships. But the fact remains that very little evidence is available for study of a Pygmy language, though there is a suggestion that such existed. Neither are the anthropometric data for the Bushmen adequate for comparison with those of the Pygmies. As previously indicated, the evidence for wide distribution of Pyg? mies is satisfactory, and a picture of a centralized substratum of Pygmy peoples is permissible. But the hypothesis that Bushmen migrated from north Africa rests on cultural evidence of stone arti? facts and mural art, together with survival of a click language in Tanganyika. The absence of skeletal remains and of living Bush? man types in the alleged areas of migration still leaves valid the rival hypothesis of evolution of a Bushman type in south Africa. With regard to miscegenation of Pygmies with Negroes and the production of intermediate types there is conclusive evidence. Bush? men have likewise mixed with Negroes, and the Hottentot is probably a product of Bushman miscegenation with Negro, Hamite, or both. Some of the facts of Pygmy miscegenation with Negroes were adduced in discussing the low stature and the high mesaticephaly of certain Congo and Cameroons tribes. And to the data mentioned</page><page sequence="237">242 Source Book for African Anthropology other corroborative facts may now be added. The anthropometric data of Poutrin (1910, 1911, 1912, 1914) for the Sanga Pygmies is a clear demonstration of the hybrid nature of these tribes whose stature, cephalic index, and form of nose are intermediate between those of true Negroes and pure-bred Pygmies. The figures of Kuhn (1914) corroborate those of Poutrin. F. Starr (1909, p. 105) gives anthropometric data for a group of ten adult Batwa males. He finds that the average stature was 1542 mm., or about five feet, considerably in excess of measurements for Bambuti Pygmies. The nasal index for this group is comparable with that of Bambuti Pygmies, though somewhat lower, that is to say, the noses of the Batwa are not quite so broad as those of the true Pygmies. The cephalic index Starr gives as 77.2, which is rather lower than that of the true Pygmies. Of the remnants of former Pygmy tribes in Abyssinia, A. D. Smith (1897, pp. 272-275) says the chief characteristics of the Dume Pygmies were a black skin, round features, woolly hair, small oval eyes, rather thick lips, high cheek bones, a broad but not remarkably receding forehead. Donaldson Smith believes that Pygmies in? habited the whole of the country north of lakes Stefani and Rudolf long before any of the other tribes now to be found in the neighborhood; but they have been gradually killed off in war and have lost their characteristics by intermarriage with people of large stature, so that only this one little remnant, the Dume, remains to prove the existence of a Pygmy race. In conclusion of the subject of Pygmy admixture with Negroes, Schebesta's (1934) "Vollblutneger und Halbzwerge," should be consulted for an expansion of the facts relating to crossbreeding given in his statistical data (1933). Lebzelter (Lebzelter and Schebesta, 1933, p. 69) sums up as follows: "Finally I wish to advance my opinion that basically the pygmi forms are identical with the pure breed pygmies, but that they have acquired new racial features different from those of the Pygmies by mixing with different Negro races, and partly perhaps also under the influence of a different environment." Fig. 53a gives a clear impression of the Batwa type of Pygmy, who has been produced by the crossings of true Pygmies and Negroes. In the absence of sufficient anthropometric data for Bushmen and Hottentots, no definite statement of their similarities can be made. In physiognomy they are much alike, but differences in skull form and stature have been noted. Broom (1923a, p. 142)</page><page sequence="238">Physical Anthropology 243 describes the Hottentots as being one of the most long-headed of all peoples, with a cephalic index of under 70 and sometimes as low as 64. In the pure Bushman the C.I. is 76-80. Broom further states (1923b, p. 288) that physically the Korana seems to be a Hotten? tot with an appreciable Bantu or other Negro strain, and also blood of the Australoid race. Vedder and Fourie (1928, pp. 39-78) discuss the hypothesis that the Hottentots were sheep and cattle herders who migrated down the east side of Africa, and that on their way they enslaved the Berg Damara, a people of Negro appearance who now speak the Hottentot language, which has Hamitic elements. E. Fischer (1913) has written a comprehensive work describing the miscegenation of Hottentots and Dutch; to the crossbreeds he gives the name Rehobother Bastards. His map (p. 6) shows the topographical distribution of five main groups southwest of Wind? hoek (Windhuk) in southwest Africa. Fischer gives several tables to show the intermediate values of anthropometric measurements of Bastards between those for Dutch and pure-bred Hottentots. Table 3 (Fischer) shows the cephalic index of the Bastards to be about 75-76, in between 80.3 for the Dutch, and 73.4-74.8 for Hottentots. The same merging of traits is indicated by the inter orbital width, the bizygomatic, and height of the face, because Bas? tards have intermediate measurements. But from Table 8 (Fischer) the Hottentot form of nose appears to be dominant. The N.I. for pure Hottentots is given as 91.5, for the pure Dutch as 65.7, and for the hybrids as 85.5, which is much closer to the pure Hottentots than to the Dutch index. The measurements, geographical tables, and photographic plates constitute one of the most detailed sources available for the study of crossing of types in Africa. For the social and economic results of race mixture consult editorial notes in "Africa," vol. 10,1937, p. 115. There a brief summary is given of the views of the Congres International. Negroes.?The place of origin, the time of branching from the primary stem, the wanderings in Africa, and the differentiation in language and physique among Negroes are open questions. That African and Melanesian Negroes have had a common origin in the hypothetical Black Belt of south-central Asia is feasible enough, but we do not know. M. Delafosse (1931, p. 5) says, "It appears then that one may, until proof to the contrary be forthcoming, admit as established the theory according to which the Negroes of Africa are not, properly speaking, autochthonous, but come from migrations having their</page><page sequence="239">244 Source Book for African Anthropology point of departure toward the limits of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific.,, Delafosse means that the ancestors of present African Negroes invaded Africa after separating themselves from a Negro matrix which included Negroes of a Melanesian type. This, how? ever, is mainly speculative, but corroborative evidence in the form of a kulturkreis theory seeking to establish relationships between Melanesia, Indonesia, and Africa will have to be mentioned later. The current belief is that true Negroes were forced westward across Africa, where they are now represented in physical type by the tribes of the Niger Delta, and by the Kru of Liberia. The Hamitic invaders are known to have mixed with the conquered Negroes, so producing an almost endless gradation of types, somewhere between the sturdy, platyrrhine, almost black Negro and the brown skinned, mesorrhine or leptorrhine Hamites. The physical appearance of Negroes in widely separated areas has previously been discussed, with the result that, despite some obvious differences of build and physiognomy, and the existence of broad linguistic divisions such as Sudanic and Bantu, the similarities of types are more impressive than the differences. We found the Nilotic Negroes to be the most distinctive of the Negro types considered. "A Survey of the Ethnography of Africa" (Johnston, 1913) is a useful summary of hypothetical migrations, and of some recent movements of Negro tribes that can be vouched for by docu? mentary evidence from the period a.d. 1500 onward. But some of Johnston's views need critical examination. He states, for example, that "the Congo Pygmy seems to be little else than a primitive and dwarfed form of the Forest Negro, perhaps representing one of the earliest types of Negro that invaded Africa." Recent research, as we have seen, establishes the Pygmies as something more specific than a degenerative Negro stock. There is no lack of reliable evidence of Negro migration during the historical period in west, central, east, and south Africa. And this evidence is to be sought in European records as well as in the genealogies and traditions of African chiefs. Moreover, there is the testimony of cultural traits and of languages. Beyond a doubt there has been a great ebb and flow of Negro tribes, with consequent mixture among themselves and with the conquering Hamites and Arabs. In the eastern Sudan the activities of the Mahdi led to depopula? tion of large areas by raiding for slaves. The victims were trans? ferred to Omdurman, from which center they were widely distributed.</page><page sequence="240">Physical Anthropology 245 Slave caravans have crossed from the western Sudan to north Africa, and both Arab and Berber tribes have received an addition of Negro blood. The depredations of Rabeh toward the end of the nineteenth century caused shifts of population throughout the Sudan, and especially in the neighborhood of Lake Chad. Warfare between the great empires of the Niger, and between those of Nigeria have also been responsible for tribal mixtures. In east Africa the salient events affecting the physique of popula? tions are focused in caravan trade and warfare. Caravans of slaves from the far interior were brought to Zanzibar, where they were sold and widely distributed. The Baganda have within historical times extended their dominion round Lake Victoria Nyanza. The Masai have swept southward down the eastern side of the continent. Internal dissension among Zulu tribes caused independent leaders to march northward, so affecting the Bathonga of Portuguese East Africa, the Wayao, the Wanyamwezi, the Wahehe, and even tribes as far north as the southern shore of Victoria Nyanza. Movements of Negro tribes in the interior of Africa have occurred on a large scale within historical times. Migrations of the Bushongo from the Shari River to their present location in the southwest of the Congo Basin probably took place about the sixth century of our era. The Baluba, who are a part of the Bushongo, journeyed from highlands north of Lake Tanganyika. The Fan, who now live north of the mouth of the Congo, crossed to their present position from the northeast of the Congo area. In a.d. 1600 the Jagas, a predatory tribe, were moving over wide ranges of territory in northern Angola, raiding for slaves and carrying these for long distances. The Ovim bundu have formed long-distance caravans that have ranged across Africa, returning with slaves and ivory, and this traffic continued until late in the nineteenth century. These are but a few of the instances of events that have led to the mixture of physical traits, languages, and cultures, but the examples indicate the nature of the migrations that have been accessory to the main mass movements of physical types. The following authors have made contributions to the study of recent movements of Negroes. Wild (1934) quotes Reindorf (1895), who has contributed a "History of the Gold Coast and Ashanti." Urvoy (1936) produced a study of the "History of the Population of the Sudan." A. E. Robinson (1929) has contributed to our knowl? edge of Arab and Negro contacts in the Province of Sennar, eastern</page><page sequence="241">246 Source Book for African Anthropology Sudan. Johnson (1921) and Dalzel (1793) should be consulted for the history of the Yorubas and Dahomeans respectively. Beyond a doubt many important movements of laborers and traders have occurred within recent times. But our ideas of the amount of miscegenation due to this influx must be modified by Migeod's (1919) study of "Tribal Mixture on the Gold Coast." He states: "The ethnological influence of foreigners, whether Euro? pean or African, on the original population of the colony is very small indeed, and were any financial change to take place so that trade and industries declined, it would be found that the majority of strangers would return to their homes, with the result that their past sojourn in the country in so many thousands would be scarcely discernible." This applies, however, only to voluntary and indentured labor introduced for specific purposes into various parts of Africa. It is conceivable that mine laborers might be introduced from many different regions and that they would represent several distinct physical types. Yet they might return at the end of their contract without having made any appreciable difference to the physique of the people among whom they temporarily resided. This, however, does not minimize the importance of warfare, slavery, and secession among ruling families, as factors in miscegenation. In dealing with the history of several Congo tribes, Torday (1928) has condensed considerable information into small compass. He attaches great historical value to the clan songs of the Bakongo and the Batetela, and he gives instances of the chronological use of oral traditions of eclipses of the sun. Bushongo tradition, which is a compound of fact and mythology relating to the great ruler, Shamba Bolongongo, is examined, and Torday's bibliography includes refer? ences to the works of early Portuguese explorers and priests. Young's (1933) study of "Tribal Mixture in Northern Nyasa land," with an excellent map, is an example of the kind of local study that is really illuminating. Portuguese sources as far back as a.d. 1616 are consulted, and a study is made of the distribution of tribal groups before they were disturbed by intrusions. Examination of present traditions indicates the value of place names in determining migrations. The cultural effects of intrusions are examined, and a summary is given of the major conflicts, including those with southern intruders who came north about a.d. 1845. The data provide instructive instances of cultural and physical miscegenation arising from trade and warfare.</page><page sequence="242">Physical Anthropology 247 Before undertaking a detailed study of the migrations of Bantu tribes in south Africa there are introductory articles that should be consulted. Fantham (1936), with the aid of a tribal map (p. 154), discusses the entry of Bantu into south Africa from the eastern side of the continent. He postulates a series of waves of invasion from east-central Africa and states that there can be no doubt of the northern origin. "In the eighth century, the Bantu were known to Arab and Persian traders on the East Coast under the names of Kafir (infidel) or Zeng (black). Probably at this time they were living in the area now known as Northern Rhodesia. As recorded by El Masudi in the tenth century, the Bantu tribes were known to be around Sofala, having crossed the Zambezi but not the Sabi River. The Hottentots or Wakwaks were then to the south of them. "Apparently there were three main streams of Bantu migrating southwards, by the west coast, the east coast, and more or less central routes, conquering and mixing with their predecessors as they went. "The Bantu migrating by the western route became known as the Hereros. They settled south of the Cunene River and around Lake Ngami and extended to the Atlantic. They included the modern Ovambos or Ambos and sub-tribes. Under European rule, especially during the German domination in South West Africa, some became scattered and a few entered the Waterberg district of the Transvaal. "The most important streams of migration were those by the East Coast. Of these, four linguistic groups of Bantu can be dis? tinguished, and these seem to correspond to some extent with waves of invasion. These four groups are the Makalanga and the Bech wana traveling inland and more central, and the Bathonga or Baronga and the Zulu-Xosa or Zulu-Kafir along the coast. The Bechwana and the Zulu-Kafir are especially important/' The notes of Fantham on hybrids are particularly germane to our present subject. He points out that during intertribal warfare conquerors killed the vanquished males and absorbed the conquered women into their own tribes. As examples of hybrids Fantham gives the Korana, who are Hottentots with some Bushman admix? ture, and the Berg Damara, who are early Bantus with Bushman and Hottentot blood. The Ba Tamaha, near Potchefstroom, are mixed tribes of Ba Lala and Bushman origin. The Ma Sarwa or Vaalpeens, hybrids of Bushmen and Ba Kalahari, are the cattle herders of the Ba Mangwato. The Ba Thlaping are a Bechuana stock who</page><page sequence="243">248 Source Book for African Anthropology married Korana wives, and in this cross the Bushman and Hottentot characters are dominant to the Bantu. Many other mixtures are described. Some data are given by Fantham under the heading "Eurafrican Admixtures/' two principal crosses being those between white men and Hottentot women, and between white men and Xosa, Tembu, and Fingo women. Diagrams are given to illustrate the progeny of a fair-haired, blue-eyed Belgian with a Zulu woman, of a Dutch Xosa marriage, and other crosses, including those of Tamils and Zulus, Chinese and Xosa. The article concludes with a survey of the results of miscegenation, which gives rise not only to social and economic problems, but sometimes to physical deterioration of off? spring, and to family discord. The subject of miscegenation has also been treated by G. Findlay (1936). Dicke (1932, p. 793) gives a brief summary of Bantu migrations into south Africa and the routes by which they traveled. Portuguese records show that about a.d. 1500 the eastern branch of the Bantu migration, of which there were also central and western branches, had advanced southward along the coast to the region of Delagoa Bay. A century later the migration was south of Delagoa Bay and fifty years after that had reached Natal. Dicke does not describe the western migration into Angola and South West Africa, but he analyzes the causes that retarded the central migration while the eastern and western wings were advancing southward. These brief publications describing the migrations and misce? genations of the Bantu introduce two comprehensive works, "Olden Times in Zululand and Natal" (Bryant, 1929), and "The South Eastern Bantu" (Soga, 1930). These are works of great detail, giving an account of tribal histories, genealogies, conquests, and miscegenation. See also Krige (1936, pp. 1-22). Hamites and Semites.?The origin and remote history of the Hamites and Semites is unknown, but both are offshoots from a greater stock termed the Mediterranean. The origin of this stock is unknown, but presumably it arose in Asia and certainly spread westward along the African and European shores of the Mediter? ranean Sea. Hooton (1931, p. 506) summarizes the physical char? acters that are typical of the Mediterranean stock. The head form is dolichocephalic, and the heads are either low or of medium height. The occiput protrudes, the forehead is vertical, and the development of brow ridges is slight. Hair and eye color vary from black to dark brown, and skin color is extremely variable, from pale olive brown</page><page sequence="244">Physical Anthropology 249 to dark brown. The face is oval and narrow, and the nose leptorrhine with N.I. 65-69. The stature is about 1620 mm. Sergi (1901) gives full details of this Mediterranean stock and a list of European and African peoples derived therefrom. The popu? lations of Spain, Italy, and Greece are basically Mediterranean stock, and in Africa the Libyans (prototype of the present Berbers), Tuareg, Somali, and Arabs are regarded as specialized branches of Homo mediterraneansis. G. Elliot Smith (1911, pp. 49-51) gives a description of the Proto Egyptian physique and speaks of these peoples as "kinsmen" of the Mediterranean group who were subject later to alien mixture. The skeletons of Proto-Egyptians with dried flesh adhering have been preserved from the pre-dynastic period, before 4000 b.c. The physical type was slender, almost effeminate. The stature was about 1650 mm., and the head was dolichocephalic. The hair, which sometimes had a reddish tinge, was similar to that of the brunet South European or Iberian of the present day. "It was a very dark brown or black colour, wavy or almost straight, and sometimes curly, but it presented no resemblance whatever to the so-called 'woolly' appearance and peppercorn-like arrangement of the Negro's hair." Interments of the pre-dynastic period show that the Proto Egyptians were buried on the left side with the knees flexed to the chin. Underneath the body was a mat, and near-by were flint imple? ments together with red pottery jars having black rims. Skeletal remains indicate that people of another physical type imposed themselves on the slenderly built people who inhabited Lower Egypt before the dawn of datable history. The bones of these new arrivals indicate that they were of sturdier build, also that their heads were rounder and their jaws more massive than those of the pre-dynastic Egyptians. The mixing of these types led to the establishment of an Egyptian type that has remained remarkably constant to the present day. With regard to the preservation of an ancient Egyptian type and the slight admixture of Negro blood, C. G. Seligman (1913, p. 606) states: "In stature the Beni Amer and the pre-dynastic Egyptians stand close together, the former measuring about 1.64 m. and the latter 1.63 m. It seems then that it is justifiable to regard the Beni Amer, the least modified of the Beja tribes, as the modern representa? tives of the old pre-dynastic Egyptian (and Nubian) stock, and it further appears that the modification undergone by the latter during a period of some 7,000 or more years is extremely small.</page><page sequence="245">250 Source Book for African Anthropology "An examination of a small series of Hadendoa skulls, now in the Royal College of Surgeons, affords nothing but confirmation of the view that these Beja tribes are closely related to the Proto-Egyptians. Although the Beni Amer are shorter than their northern congeners, there is no regular rise in stature as there is in cephalic index from south to north. The very considerable difference between Beni Amer and Hadendoa is no doubt to be explained as a result of misce? genation with the tall Negroes of the Nile Valley. It needs only a glance at any considerable gathering of Hadendoa to be convinced that as a people they have absorbed much Negro blood. My im? pression is that the Bisharin are less mixed/' Morant's (1925) discussion of a long series of male Egyptian skulls, divided according to localities and dynasties, traces out the changes that took place during the evolution of the Egyptian type. His series extends from pre-dynastic to Ptolemaic times. The follow? ing quotations indicate the preservation of type and the absence of appreciable Negro mixture. "In early Pre-Dynastic times there were two distinct races of man living in Egypt; one in the Thebaid and the other, it is supposed, in the Faiyum. These may be called the Upper and the Lower Egyptian races. They were closely related to one another as two adjacent peoples are generally found to be, and there can be no doubt that they diverged from the same branch of the human tree at no very early date. "The Lower Egyptian type seems to have remained unchanged from Early Dynastic to Ptolemaic times except that a relatively small part of the population was modified very slightly, possibly by admixture with some unknown foreign race. "The Upper Egyptian type was slowly transformed from the very earliest times in which we have acquaintance with it, and by Late Dynastic times the population of Upper Egypt was of almost pure Lower Egyptian type. "It is very generally supposed that the population of ancient Egypt was sensibly affected at various times by the infusion of Negro blood. But in the series of which we have the mean measure? ments it is not possible to detect the slightest effect of any such admixture that can have taken place after early Pre-Dynastic times. Apart from isolated negroid skulls . . . the populations appear to be quite homogeneous and we have no reason to suppose that the mean type was affected in the slightest by admixture with any race foreign to Egypt."</page><page sequence="246">Physical Anthropology 251 C. S. Myers (1906, p. 239) gives a list of regions where he made anthropometric measurements. The figures for nasal indices indi? cate that in living Egyptians of today there is a slight broadening of the nose among people living farther south. In the delta region the average group indices varied from 73.4 to 76.7, but farther south, near the Negro belt, the nasal indices became 77.8 to 78.9. Fig. 35 shows two present-day Egyptians of Luxor. One is a Ham itic type, and the other shows Negro admixture. Analysis of the elements entering into the composition of north and northeast Africans at the present day is a complex exercise. If we visualize a Mediterranean stock with the branches previously mentioned, we have then to allow for miscegenations of the varieties of this stock with people inhabiting north Africa when Homo mediter raneansis arrived. Moreover, later incursions have also to be considered. Hooton's summary of the migration of physical types along the north African littoral has been quoted (chap. Ill, Prehistory). The colored maps of Bertholon and Chantre (1912) giving distribu? tion of statures, cranial indices, nasal indices, and pigmentation show how complicated the miscegenation, the wanderings, and isolation of types have been. For the main part distributions are discontinuous and certain types are left as islands. Bertholon and Chantre summarize the types thus: (1) dolichocephalic and small stature; (2) brachycephalic and small stature; (3) dolichocephalic, tall, and leptorrhine; (4) types of southern oases showing Negro admixture. The first group has a stature of 1630 mm., a C.I. of 73-75, and an N.I. of 70-74. Group 2 has a stature of 1640-1650 mm., a C.I. of 79-82, and an N.I. of 68-70. Group 3 has a stature of 1700 mm. or more, a C.I. of 73-76, and an N.I. of 66-68. With such main varieties a large number of subvarieties is possible. The same kinds of analyses have been made by Cerulli (1935) and Cotteville-Giraudet (1930). The latter distinguishes seven types that are still discernible in the present-day north African population. He gives the distinguishing traits of each and type photographs. According to Cotteville-Giraudet (p. 148) the com? position of the present population is Homo mediterraneansis 40 per cent, H. atlanticus 25 per cent (original Paleolithic people), H. semiticus 20 per cent, H. nordicus 5 per cent, H. negroidus 5 per cent, Niger africanus 3 per cent, H. asiaticus 2 per cent (Neolithic). Among the unexplained physical traits of north Africa are the peculiar skulls from the oasis of Siwa. Derry (1927), relying more</page><page sequence="247">252 Source Book for African Anthropology on the acroplatic index (100 B-H'/L) than the cranial index, finds traits, for example, the basi-bregmatic height, that do not occur elsewhere among African crania. For comparable figures the crani ology of the English, German, and French have to be consulted (p. 204). The nasal index of Siwan skulls is near to that for Euro? peans. The cranial capacities for both males and females are lower than those for Europeans but much higher than those for Negroes. Deny states that the Siwan skulls are not Egyptian but does not definitely classify them. Siwa has always been remote and secluded. Is it possible that we have in these Siwan skulls a sample of the European branch of the Mediterranean stock, a branch which did not advance far into Africa, but became isolated at Siwa? Inquiring into the problem of blondness might conveniently start with an article by Kidder (1927), who discusses the pigmenta? tion of the skin, hair, and eyes of the Kabyles. Kidder criticises the vague use of the word blondness; terms are needed to describe degrees of this trait, which varies from complete blondness of three factors to one blond trait. Coon (1931, pp. 348-386) gives this subject a thorough investigation. He uses mathematical methods to describe the degree of association between each pair of blond factors, and between factors of blondness and anthropometric measurements. "In each of the three areas Rif, Senhaja, and Ghomara the blonder types segregate themselves out from the brunet types in a European direction." Coon (p. 386) speaks of one of the central types as being like a blond north European. Sergi (1901, pp. 61-69) surveys the history of discussion respect? ing the entry of these blond people, their mingling with a dark Mediter? ranean stock, and the possibility that these blonds (Homo nordicus) were the dolmen builders of north Africa. Sergi (p. 74) attributes the blond factor to altitude, but his theory, like the one attributing blondness to the Goth and Vandal invaders of a.d. 500, is not now seriously regarded. Hooton (1925, p. 76) gives references to show that the presence of blonds in north Africa, for example among the Libyans, was anciently observed and recorded. But we do not actually know the origin of the blond element unless it came from Nordic Europe; or perhaps blondness was a trait of the north African brand of the Mediterranean stock. There are, however, problems of miscegenation that are explain? able by anthropometric measurements, especially the nasal index, as well as by general description such as that given by Delafosse (1894) for the eastern Hamites. Lester (1928) illustrates the effect</page><page sequence="248">Physical Anthropology 253 of Negro mixture on the Galla. The Negro element is indicated by dark skin color, prognathism, and a high mesorrhine nasal index of 77.5. But for twenty-two Somali of Hamitic type the N.I. was low, 65.7, though there was a variability in width of nose and thickness of lips that indicated Negro admixture (Radlauer, 1914). Anthropometric studies of the Tibbu of Tibesti in the eastern Sahara illustrate the effects of Negro mixture with what appears from the photographs to be a Hamitic strain (Sabatini, 1936, pp. 253-269; Biasutti, 1933). The former reference gives the N.I. as 78.1, which is mesorrhine, and the type photographs indicate varia? tion of Negro features; some individuals are more pronouncedly Negroid than others. The stature for 126 male Tibbu was 1665 mm. and the C.I. 76.1, but these traits are not distinctive since they can be matched by group averages found among Negroes, Hamites, and Semites. Leblanc (1934) measured thirty-one males of Zenata near Insalah, and these he considered in two divisions, the Ouled Souka who describe themselves as Tuareg, and the Ouled Dihamou who are of Moroccan origin. The Arabs hold these people in contempt, saying that they are half-breeds. Leblanc notes great variability in height, cranial index, and nasal index, which is often an indication of misce? genation. The nasal index is often highly mesorrhine?from 70 to 80?so bordering on the typical platyrrhine index of the Negro. When dealing with the more recent historical aspects of migration and miscegenation, anthropometry is sometimes aided by study of oral tradition. C. G. and B. Z. Seligman (1918, pp. 106-112) and MacMichael (1912) have given detailed histories of the Kababish of Kordofan. Seligman (p. 107) says the "Kababish are a congeries of divisions of various Arab tribes with a minority of Hamitic origin and a dash of Negro blood." The richest divisions, who possess most slaves, tend to show the highest proportion of individuals with Negro or Negroid features. Struck (1920-21) has analyzed the population of Kordofan from the anthropometric and linguistic point of view. He considers Hamitoid, Negroid, and Bantoid groups, for which he gives statures, cranial indices, and nasal indices. His summary of results (p. 168) indicates a correlation of linguistic elements and somatic traits. H. R. Palmer (1932, 1934) has studied historical data relating to the Tuareg, and in addition to weighing the evidence of oral tradi? tion, vocabulary, and cultural traits, he has made use of Arabic docu? ments from the ninth century of our era onward. The Tuareg, a</page><page sequence="249">254 Source Book for African Anthropology typical camel-culture people, were probably not present in the north Sahara in appreciable numbers before the time when camels became numerous (a.d. 193-364). Not until the ninth century is clear information available to prove the presence of the Tuareg in the Fezzan. In Palmer's opinion (1932, p. 308) there is a probability that the "Tuareg, and their T'ifinagh alphabet, first came into the northern Sahara bringing camels with them from the eastern Sudan between the years 300 and 600 of our era." Historical research, no matter what the nature of the testimony may be, usually serves to whet the appetite; inquiries are pushed farther and farther, but always toward a horizon that fades into the distance as the explorer proceeds. In conclusion of the section dealing with extant types, their wanderings and mixtures, attention should be called to the historical notes that are to be found in almost every tribal monograph. A great task of compilation awaits a student who will make a com? parative study of these references with a view to testing their accuracy one against another and finally synthesizing them into a more complete picture.</page><page sequence="250">V. CONGENITAL ANOMALIES, DEFORMATION, ORNAMENTS, AND CLOTHING ABNORMALITIES Congenital anomalies of Negroes and other Africans have not formed the subject of a comprehensive work, and data are insufficient for wide study of family inheritance of abnormalities. Yet numerous articles call attention to some common pathological conditions. One of the commonest aberrancies among Negroes is albinism, which is of interest in both its physiological and social aspects. An article by H. Stannus (1913), medical officer in Nyasaland, calls attention to the different forms of albinism occurring in that territory. Stannus quotes a classification of albinos offered by K. Pearson, and mentions the divisions as complete albinotic (Fig. 49, a), spotted albinotic condition, blue-eyed and white-skinned, yellow-eyed and white-skinned, xanthous (yellow), and piebald (Fig. 49, b). With this classification Stannus is not in full agreement. He thinks that the pink-eyed condition if present at all is rare, and that observers who have seen the general albinotic condition have assumed the pinkish condition of the eye, since this occurs in European albinos. Categories of albinos given by Stannus differ somewhat from those suggested by Pearson. The incidence of albinism among Negro males and females respectively would be of interest to biologists, but I am not aware that any data have been published on the subject. Albinos have been of interest to ethnologists, and though evidence respecting the social status of these abnormal persons has not yet been fully collated, a few references indicate the trends of tribal reaction. A trader in the year 1860 states that at Onitsha in Nigeria two belligerent chiefs who were about to arrange terms of peace pur? chased an albino who sat between the chiefs while they were dis? cussing the terms of the treaty. Laying their hands on the albino the former combatants solemnly declared that if ever they fought again it should be as allies. Each agreed that if he broke the pledge his family should be sold into slavery. An executioner struck off the albino's head while the two peacemakers held the body (Cole, 1862, p. 14). According to J. Weeks (1914, p. 238) the Bakongo require the presence of an albino or some hair from one before they are able to form a new branch of a powerful secret society known as ndembo. 255</page><page sequence="251">256 Source Book for African Anthropology Father van Wing (1921, p. 159) speaks of an albino being regarded as the reincarnation of a chief. C. K. Meek (1931b, vol. 1, p. 143) states that among the Bura of Bornu Province several albinos were ob? served, and he discovered that they are regarded with disfavor, are refused the tribal marks, and that no girl will marry one. I was informed by Vachokwe people of east Angola that an albino found difficulty in obtaining a spouse. J. Weeks (1913, p. 325) notes a similar matrimonial disability among the Bangala. R. Burton (1860, vol. 1, p. 9) reports the occurrence of many albinos among the Wazaramo, and he states that no prejudice is directed against them. The few instances of albinism here considered indicate three possible social attitudes. The condition may be disregarded within the tribe, or the albinos may be sacred in the sense of something set apart because it is unusual and unexplained, and yet again the condition may be regarded as a definite cause for social disabilities. In a survey of abnormalities present at birth among several tribes of Nyasaland, H. Stannus (1914) has pointed out that obser? vations of this kind do not give a correct estimate of the frequency of congenital disabilities, since defective children are destroyed at birth. Stannus thinks that a child with a harelip would undoubt? edly be killed, and in general the more pronounced the abnormality the less the chance of survival. Contacts of Africans with Europeans either at mission stations or in government service tend to counteract infanticide; therefore with the further extension of European in? fluence observers may obtain a more accurate impression of the frequency of abnormalities. Infantilism was observed in a woman of twenty-two years, who had no breast development, no body hair, and had not menstruated. Dwarfism (Fig. 53, b) with normal mental ability was recorded, but no acromegaly (giantism) was noted. Examples of undeveloped zygomatic arches and a rudimentary lower jaw were photographed. The subject was an imbecile with impaired speech. H. Stannus observed a mongol idiot and two microcephalic (small-headed) idiots. Cysts of the face occur. Abnormal ears were seen. Super? numerary nipples were observed. Reduplication of teeth, humeral micromely (short upper arm), and malformations of hands and feet were noted and photographed. The records include the presence of supernumerary fingers and toes, and the joining of digits (polydactyly and syndactyly).</page><page sequence="252"></page><page sequence="253">258 Source Book for African Anthropology More properly within the scope of ethnology is the subject of artificial deformations. Perhaps the words "artificial modifications of the body" would be preferable, since the changes are not con? sidered as deformations but as embellishments by those who make them. The reasons for these artificial modifications are the grati? fication of esthetic taste; the preservation of tribal and social distinctions; the marking of differences of age and sex; designation of membership in a secret society ; and desire to comply with certain religious and magical observances. Artificial modifications are carried out on the skin by several methods; namely, scarification, painting, and tattooing. The teeth, the lips, the ears, the nose, the head, body and sex organs, and the hair are subject to treatment. Often the changes are of an elaborate kind and specialists are employed to perform the operations. corporal marks As a general introduction to the subject of body marking, Hambly (1925) should be consulted. The flesh of Negroes has a natural tendency to form large keloids or cicatrices after injury, and advantage has been taken of this fact to form elaborate geometrical patterns by making symmetrical cuts, the healing of which is some? times retarded by rubbing earth into the wounds. This mutilation of the skin may be merely ornamental, but usually the patterns have a tribal significance. Some idea of the great variety of distinctive patterns for tribes is given by Tremearne (1911), who describes scarification among Nigerian people, and by C. H. Armitage (1924), in his account of this form of decoration in the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast. According to S. Passarge (1907, p. 27) some Bushmen have a magical use for scarification. Into cuts made on the body a little flesh from an antelope is introduced; this procedure gives the speed of the antelope to the Bushman. Scarification in the Munshi tribe of southern Nigeria provides an example of variation of marking with sex. Women adopt an elaborate abdominal scarification (Fig. 50, a), but men have simple tribal marks consisting of a few round keloids on the cheeks. A sex difference in marking is observable among the Ovimbundu of Angola. Men are not much scarified, but women mark their cheeks with small circles into which burnt rubber is introduced, so that after healing the mark has a blue tinge. Degree of scarification among Negroes varies from complete absence to the cutting of designs</page><page sequence="254">a 1 ' ?vgWWBy^v^fP Go 259</page><page sequence="255">260 Source Book for African Anthropology that cover the entire face and torso. Some of the most severe scarification is to be found among the tribes of the central Congo region. In Sierra Leone examples of body scars denoting member? ship of a secret society have been recorded. These instances are typical of the principal functions of scarification, and further colla? tion of examples could be carried out almost indefinitely, so numer? ous are the Negro tribes who mutilate the skin in this way. Body marking of this kind may be the result of therapeutic treatment; for example, the Vasele of Angola scar the chest to cure a cough. Making of keloids may be part of the rites of initiation into the tribe, yet on the contrary the scars may be made during infancy and for ornament only (Decorse, 1905b; Germann, 1933, p. 20; Buisson, 1934). Tattooing by making punctures into which indigo dye is rubbed is characteristic of light-skinned Egyptians, and Berber tribes of Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. The practice has spread into Nigeria, and some tattooed persons may be seen in Kano. Body marking is forbidden by the Koran, but this injunction is disregarded by Mohammedans provided the operation is not performed during Ramadan. In the larger towns of north Africa, tattoo marks may be signs of prostitution. The designs may be merely decorative, or again they may have a magical import. Certain designs represent the lucky hand of Fatima, daughter of the Prophet, and other marks are supposed to preserve the eyesight. Certain symbols tattooed on the face or body are said to be a protection against snake-bite, or to give health to the lungs (Roth, 1905). Other important references to tattooing in north Africa are Lacassagne (1912, 1934, 1935), Gobert (1924), Van Gennep (1912), Gaudry (1929, pp. 43-46), Karutz (1909), Bertholon and Chantre (1912, pp. 478-493), and Herber (1923), who emphasizes the magical-religious significance of tattooing. Painting the body with colored earths is one of the most common forms of decoration, and the usage is widespread among Negro tribes in connection with initiation ceremonies and secret societies. Painting the face or body may have a therapeutic value; for instance, women of the Ovimbundu have their faces decorated with small white and red marks which are made by a medicine-woman during their pregnancy. Unguents for the hair and body are freely used by many tribes. Palm oil is a usual dressing for the skin and hair, while camwood powder is a reddish and aromatic dressing for the skin. In the south of Angola the Vakwanyama make powder from</page><page sequence="256">s ?o a &amp; 09 ' j^^^^^^^^^B 261</page><page sequence="257">262 Source Book for African Anthropology red takula wood; this dust is then freely rubbed into the greasy hides which are used as skirts for women. Kohl, a kind of antimony, was used for decorating the eyelids in Egypt in ancient times. This practice has spread over north Africa together with the custom of staining the finger nails with henna, and both embellishments have been adopted to some extent by the more advanced tribes of west Africa. mutilation of teeth, lips, nose, ears Mutilation of the teeth is common among Negro tribes and the styles are usually indicative of tribal divisions. In Angola Ovim bundu males remove a small V-shaped piece from between the two upper central incisors. The Babunda remove an oval piece from the same position. The Vasele chip all their teeth to points (Fig. 51, a). Numerous illustrations of different methods of mutilating the teeth in the southwest Congo region are given by F. Starr (1909, pp. 115 124). Instances of extraction of the two middle incisors of the lower jaw are given by A. C. Hollis (1905, p. 313). Fig. 51, b shows deformation of teeth of a Sara man near Lake Chad, and Fig. 52, a portrays an M'Bunda woman of Angola. Geographical distribution of the practice of boring the lips of female children during infancy, gradual enlargement of the holes by insertion of wooden plugs, and final introduction of a large disk, has been described and mapped by K. G. Lindblom (1925), while Muraz and Getzowa have also contributed to this subject (1923) in describing the extreme deformation of lips of females of the Sara tribe near Lake Chad. Extreme deformation of the ear lobes is practiced by the Masai, the Akikuyu (Fig. 54, a) and the Wandorobo of northeast Africa. Wearing of a small disk which is inserted in the side of the nose is not uncommon in Egypt and north Africa. Women of the Shuwa Arabs use this kind of decoration. Women of the Vasele tribe, Angola, used to pass a thin stick through the septum of the nose, but this custom is falling into desuetude (Fig. 52, b). skull deformation The subject of artificial cranial deformation in all parts of the world has been discussed by Dingwall (1931) who is not satisfied that this custom was practiced in ancient Egypt. Today in Africa the practice is unusual, though not unknown. The Mangbetu of the northeast Congo region (Fig. 54, b) and the adjacent Madi bind the heads of infants to make their skulls slope backward. This is a custom among the socially superior, who also show their rank by</page><page sequence="258">???^^BB^^E* ^tfB^^_*^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Ht ^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H ^^^^^^^^^ a a o ?^B^^^B 263</page><page sequence="259">j _i 264</page><page sequence="260">?

This treatment of nails is a peculiarity of the Mangbetu; I have no other African instances of the practice. P. A. Talbot (1912, p. 38) states that among the Ekoi of southeast Nigeria members of a certain secret society may be recognized by their bulging foreheads, which have resulted from cranial pressure applied during infancy. Bertholon and Chantre (1912, p. 89) have described three modern types of cranial deformation in north Africa. surgical operations Operations on the sex organs of boys and girls are not uncommon; especially are the mutilations carried out during initiation rites. The nature of these operations and some historical aspects of the rites will be discussed later. Lopping the finger joints is an African custom whose distribution has been discussed by Lagercrantz (1936, pp. 129-157); the rite prevailed among Bushmen and Hottentots. The former were in the habit of removing a joint from the little finger of boys and girls for the alleged purpose of protecting them, if previous children had died when young. Mutilation of the fingers was common among the Hottentots, but the statement that a woman was obliged to sever a finger joint before each marriage is not fully confirmed. The evidence for these mutilations among the Khoisan peoples has been discussed by I. Schapera (1930a, pp. 71-72). The practice of emasculation will be mentioned later in con? nection with slavery and punishment for adultery with the wife of a king. The practice has been both commercial and punitive. P. Kolbe, who was in contact with the Hottentots in the year 1719, refers to the excision of a left testicle during boyhood. Kolbe reported that Hottentot women were afraid that they would bear twins, but this, they believed, would be impossible if males were mutilated in this way. Some writers state that Hottentots believed that the operation increased swiftness in running. The evidence is not, however, sufficiently clear to establish the rites as a certainty (Schapera, 1930a, pp. 71-72). treatment of the hair Depilation is a mutilation resulting in complete or partial removal of eyebrows, eyelashes, and body hair. Women of the Bakongo tribe remove their eyelashes. Females of the Masai, Dinka, Bari, and Latuka shave their heads and eyebrows. When a male of the Masai tribe dies, his warrior sons shave their heads. The head of a Masai woman is shaved when her child has cut four teeth. Women</page><page sequence="262">Fig. 55.

At death this mass is cut from the head and divided among the sons of the deceased, who add it to their own chignons after washing and cleaning it. The bag of felted hair is used for holding a fire-stick, snuff, trinkets, and other small possessions. The chignon is ornamented with ostrich feathers, which are dyed yellow or red (Beech, 1911, pp. 13-14). Many remarkable patterns of hairdressing are shown by P. A. Talbot (1912, pp. 318, 319). Ekoi women shave their heads; then they allow the hair to grow to a uniform length of a quarter of an inch. Patterns are marked on the hair with white chalk, and these tufts are left on the shaven scalp. In the south of Angola several adjacent tribes, the Luvando, Vanhaneca, Gambos, and others, are readily distinguishable by their styles of coiffure. In the Bapedi tribe a widow shaves her head completely after the death of her husband. A woman shaves her head to some extent to observe the death of any relative, and the size of the shorn area corresponds with her degree of relationship to the deceased (Duggan-Cronin, Eiselen, vol. 2, Plate 52). clothing There still exist in Africa several tribes who have no clothing. Males of the Nuer tribe are quite naked and their bodies are smeared with cow dung and ashes. On the Bauchi plateau of eastern Nigeria males of several tribes wear only a penis sheath of plaited fiber. In the Angas tribe of that region women are naked until they marry, after that a bunch of leaves is worn (Fig. 56, 6). In contrast with this nudity, clothing may be elaborately made from cotton woven by both men and women (Figs. 58-60). Many tribes from Sierra Leone to Nigeria are skilled in weaving their own cotton clothing and in making indigo and other dyes. Leather or hide clothing may be a simple pubic covering, as among Bushmen (Fig. 44); or hides may be soaked, trampled, pleated, and dressed with grease and red ocher, as among the cattle-keeping Vakwanyama (Fig. 66, a). Some Zulu tribes make elaborate fur cloaks called karosses by sewing together the pelts of hyrax and other fur-bearing creatures. Barkcloth is well made in Ashanti, west Africa, and among the Baganda of northeast Africa. Formerly this covering was widely used among Negro tribes, but the use is waning with importation of foreign cotton.

Descriptions of the technique concerned in the manufacture of clothing are given later in con? nection with handicrafts. Reference to the work of A. J?nger (1926), who has mapped the distribution of all kinds of clothing worn in Africa, will give a comprehensive survey of the subject and so prepare the way for more detailed study in section III, under the heading "Economic Life." ornaments and charms Personal ornaments of ivory, shell, or metal may be more than mere decorations. For example, among the Vakwanyama and some of the tribes of Huila, southwest Angola, disks of shell called omba are highly valued as heirlooms which are passed from mother to daughter. Such shells are sometimes worn by men (Fig. 66, 6). The new disks may be purchased for a small sum, but no offer will tempt the owner to part with disks that have become a family possession. At the present time supplies of ivory are insufficient for personal ornaments, but a few years ago massive anklets and bracelets were worn. The most cumbersome ornaments are worn by women, who, as among the lower Congo tribes, wear heavy brass collars, some examples of which weigh twenty-eight pounds. Women of the Masai, Akikuyu, and other tribes of northeast Africa wear heavy coils of wire round their legs and arms. Similar ornaments are used by women of the Munshi tribe, Nigeria, and by females of the Luvando and other tribes of southwest Angola. Stone armlets are still made and worn by the Tuareg (Rodd, 1926, pp. 91, 285) and by some west African tribes (Cardinall, 1923). Charms for attaching to the neck, arms, or clothing are numerous. In regions north of the equator, where Mohammedanism has affected magical beliefs, mallams may be seen writing texts from the Koran. These are wrapped in small satchels of leather and are attached to the clothing, or they may be worn in groups about the neck or on the upper arm. Small charms for averting the evil eye and for avoiding snake-bite are commonly seen. The most widely used charms in Negro territory are small horns which a medicine-man fills with a concoction of fat, charcoal, pounded human bone, and other ingre? dients. Charms specially designed to give fertility, to ward off sickness, and to avoid the curse of witches are numerous. Wester marck (1933, pp. 25-58) has supplied a valuable contribution to the study of charms and magic in north Africa, and much of the informa</page><page sequence="270">Deformation, Ornaments, and Clothing 275 tion applies widely to any part of the continent where Mohammedan influence has penetrated. No item of ornament, deformation, or dress is too insignificant to receive attention, for behind some of the most simple customs and objects lie beliefs of great ethnological interest. The tolerant and intelligent attitude which should be preserved by an ethnologist is well expressed by Mungo Park, who wrote (1799, p. 56), "They rallied me with a good deal of gaiety on different subjects, particularly on the whiteness of my skin and the prominence of my nose. They insisted that both were artificial. The first, they said, was produced when I was an infant by dipping me in milk, and they insisted that my nose had been pinched every day until it had acquired its present unsightly and unnatural conformation. On my part, without dis? puting my own deformity, I paid them many compliments on African beauty. I praised the glossy jet of their skins and the lovely depression of their noses."</page><page sequence="271">VI. PSYCHOLOGY The word psychology is used here to mean a study of mentality, and therefore has a wide connotation which includes every aspect of mental activity. The study is consequently concerned with individual and collective traits, achievement, educability, emotions, and the general psychic background of beliefs and practices. Research of this kind is still tentative, and opinions of specialists are divided with regard to technique and the explanation of results that are obtained. The following outline summarizes the chief methods of approach to an understanding of mental activity and the various ways in which psychological processes are expressed by beliefs, institutions, and ritual. I. Physiological theories. These relate to race, size of brain, and the functioning of endocrine glands. II. The ethnological approach. 1. General observations on conduct. 2. Study of achievement and history. 3. Recording of ethnological facts by: (a) A monograph on a tribe. (b) A functional study stressing particular traits. (c) An ethnological story. III. A psychological method which is intended to give an explana? tory background to the facts observed. 1. Broad philosophical treatment of sociological facts derived from a study of the beliefs and practices of primitive man. 2. Psychological study of children. 3. Examination of the unconscious mind. 4. Intelligence tests. 5. Dreams, songs, and folklore. INTELLIGENCE AND RACE A popular belief that intelligence is a fixed concomitant of race is probably fallacious. Professor R. H. Lowie (1923) says, "As to the existence of superior races I am an agnostic open to conviction. All evolutionists admit that at some point an organic change of funda? mental significance occurred. It is conceivable that the Bushman and Negrito, Pygmies and Negroes, are organically below the 276</page><page sequence="272">Psychology 277 remainder of living human types, and that differences of one sort or another divide even more closely related stocks. But between what is conceivable and what is definitely established there yawns a chasm; and where the scientist has no proof he holds no dogmas, though dispassionately he may frame tentative hypotheses." Lowie discusses the difference between average intellectual capacity and variability of mental capacity in a race. Two races, or other biological groups, might coincide in their average mentality but differ in range, so that one group might produce far more remark? able individuals in both positive and negative directions. If this could be established, we could account for differences in cultural achievement without assuming that the average level of intelli? gence varies in different cultures. Dr. F. Boas (1911, 1928) has written a similar protest against the assumption that a certain mental potentiality is an innate accompaniment of the bodily features that are said to constitute a race. See also T. R. Garth (1931). physiological theories The hypothesis that big brains imply great intellectual possi? bilities, and that small brains indicate impossibility of achievement, has to be abandoned. Weight of brain and cubic contents of the skull are closely correlated with height and weight of body, since a large part of the brain is concerned with directing motor activities. Moreover, there is little or no correlation between cranial capacity and examination marks. Reid and Mulligan (1923), Garth (1931), Willey and Herskovits (1927), Klineberg (1930), Aldrich (1931) and Fick (1929), have all contributed to the discussion of theories of racial mental endowment and alleged racial differences in mental capacity. Certain observations recently carried out on 3,444 male subjects in Kenya have a bearing on the subject of cranial capacity and intelligence. The average cranial capacity was found to be 1316 cc, which is low compared with the cubic capacity of European crania (1481 cc). During the period ten to twenty years of age, the average yearly increase of cranial capacity for Kenya natives is 8.5 cc. and for Europeans 17.7 cc, which is more than twice as great. After puberty, the brains of Europeans increase in size and weight, but the brains of Kenya natives grow scarcely at all (Nissen, 1935; Fick, 1929). Dr. H. L. Gordon (1934) who has worked in the laboratory of Dr. F. W. Vint, pathologist to the Kenya Government, states that brains of 100 normal, adult male natives of Kenya weighed on the</page><page sequence="273">278 Source Book for African Anthropology average 150 grams less than the European average. Dr. Vint's research has shown that the cortex or gray matter of Kenya natives' brains displayed a 15 per cent quantitative deficiency when com? pared with the European cortex. The cortex cells of Kenya brains were smaller, not so well formed, and not so well arranged as those of Europeans. The Kenya cortex is notable for the large predominance of undifferentiated cells. Anthropologists have little definite evidence of this kind on which to build their theories, and even research of this nature does not touch the fundamental problem. Brains may be small and the cells may be undifferentiated when compared with European exam? ples, but what anatomical differences would take place in a few gen? erations of stimulating environment, if the mental outlook and all kinds of intellectual contacts were fostered? No one is able to say what improvement might take place in the size and efficiency of the central nervous system as a result of changed environmental conditions. The functioning of ductless glands and the addition of hormones to the blood stream is to some extent understood in relation to normal growth and the development of sex characters. A patho? logical study of the results of excessive or subnormal secretions from the glands is in progress, and many facts have been accumulated. The feasible suggestion that the activities of ductless glands deter? mine temperament and mental characteristics in individuals and in biological groups has been advanced. But at present such specula? tions are largely theoretical. A biological study carried out by anatomical and physiological observations at present gives no satis? factory explanation of mental differences. Other methods of approach through the data of sociology, ethnology, and psychology remain to be tried. sociological tests of mentality Sociologists, stimulated by Herbert Spencer, have attempted comparative study of racial and tribal mentality by collating the opinions of travelers, traders, and missionaries. This method is entirely unsatisfactory for several reasons. According to personal impressions, which were often based on brief acquaintance and a misunderstanding of primitive customs, a tribe might be described as hospitable, cunning, ferocious, licentious, cruel, or stupid. Sacri? fice of human victims is not the result of a lust for blood, but rather a logical concomitant of religious beliefs. The victims themselves regarded the rites as necessary ceremonies for transferring their</page><page sequence="274">Psychology 279 services from a ruler in the flesh to one in the spirit. Zulu and Masai warriors, though ruthless in warfare, were not an innately cruel people; they were the inevitable product of a certain military system. Many tribes have been misjudged on the grounds of infanticide, the poison ordeal, or the practice of ceremonial cannibalism, while cer? tain customs such as polygyny and the lending of wives have led to an assumption of promiscuity. This kind of sampling cannot give any dependable data. Another fallacious method of assessing mentality and intelligence is the comparative study of achievement in industries, social organi? zation, and religion. At one time sociologists spoke of races and tribes as being high or low in the scale of humanity, and the judg? ment was passed after consideration of the arts and handicrafts. Therefore, according to this criterion, Bushman and Pygmy hunters were low because they have no knowledge of working in metals. Under this arbitrary system of classifying people as savage, bar? baric, or civilized according to their knowledge of iron-working or making pottery, certain confused social categories were established. These were artificial divisions without any basis in reality. Different environments have afforded different opportunities, and successful adaptation to conditions is a more valid test than consideration of absolute attainment. intelligence tests This desire to compare and place in categories according to some quantitative standard finds recent expression in the invention of intelligence tests. These investigations are supposed to assess inborn intelligence, apart from the mental condition that is a result of environmental factors. The results of the tests are expressed in arithmetical form as scores which enable comparisons to be made with precision. Thus Negroes have a certain intelligence quotient, and this can be compared with the quotient for other biological groups (Garth, 1931). In addition to objections of a technical kind relating to the test questions and the nature of the performance required, the erratic nature of living subjects is a further argument against the validity of the tests. The investigators are dependent on capricious, nervous, or perhaps apathetic beings on whose good will and concentration the results depend. When a psychologist asserts that his tests show that Negroes are inferior in intelligence to white men, and that this is true for groups of all ages in the two populations, opponents of the tests point out</page><page sequence="275">280 Source Book for African Anthropology that differences in social background must necessarily invalidate the results of all experiments that are designed to discover racial differences in intelligence. Moreover, argument against the validity of the tests as criteria of innate intelligence is pursued by showing that, despite the sup? posed low intelligence of the average Negro, great achievements have been made even by full-blooded African Negroes who have qualified in law, medicine, music, and literature. Born in bush villages, and educated at small mission schools, they have finally graduated in European or American universities, and have proved themselves equal to white competitors. All tests of a quantitative kind, both physiological and psychological, fail to prove an innate mental grad? ing of races and tribes according to intelligence, and so far as Africa is concerned we have little experimental knowledge to show the changes in average attainment which may be expected to follow an improved social and physical environment. Psychological tests of intelligence have been made at the Jeanes School, Kabete, Kenya. But the investigator, R. A. C. Oliver (1933, 1934), does not feel sure that these tests are valid for com? parative study of various east African tribes. Still greater is the uncertainty that such tests would be valid for comparing the intelli? gence of tribes whose social backgrounds and general cultures show great disparity. The average intelligence of the Kenya pupils was 85 per cent of that of European children, but 14 per cent of the natives equaled or surpassed the average for Europeans. A student who does not demand quantitative measurements will find helpful psychological studies in Earthy (1933), Fr?hsle (1922, 1923), Dougall (1932), and Herskovits (1935). R&amp;nondet (1935) has made a valuable short study of child psychology among west African Negroes, and Sidib? (1932) has analyzed the gaiety of African Negroes. the monograph and the story Anthropologists who are concerned with a qualitative study rather than quantitative measurement have several practical meth? ods for investigating the mental life of a tribe. A well-prepared monograph gives an account of the social, religious, and economic life, all of which aspects are shown in their mutual dependence. The objection that such a method is too static, and that the divisions are too formal, is invalid provided the investigator stresses the inter? relation of the various factors of tribal life. A functional study may select some salient factor of communal life, for example, sexual</page><page sequence="276">Psychology 281 relationships, or the quest for food, with a view to showing that vari? ous traits cluster round certain pivotal factors (A. I. Richards, 1932). This method is effective, though the inquiry is liable to create misconceptions, for social life is usually a complicated assemblage of traits whose mutual dependence is so complete that the choice of some one pivotal trait or institution is misleading. Within recent years several ethnological stories have made a successful presentation of the inner working, that is, the psychology of African tribal life. The essential qualifications for writing ethno? logical stories are close personal acquaintance with the people described, and genuine sympathy and understanding of their points of view. In Donald Frazer's "The Autobiography of an African" (1925), a study of Bantu psychology and behavior is achieved by a descrip? tion of the life history of Mtusu, who abandoned his native faith and culture in favor of Christian environment. Here is an account of the effect of two conflicting cultures on the mind of an individual, whose mental disharmonies and attempts at adjustment are effec? tively described. A practical approach to a social and psychological study of Zulu life is to be found in "Chaka, an Historical Romance," by T. Mofolo (1931), an educated Mosuto, who wrote an account of his life in Sesuto, the language of his people. The narrative gives a clear insight into the reactions of an individual toward his own institu? tions, so that a reader without any technical knowledge of ethnology or psychology is made to understand the functioning of religion, social obligations, and economic conditions, which unite to form a social pattern. J. H. Driberg's (1930) account of the Dindinga, and Ntara's "Man of Africa" (1935) attempt a realistic portrayal of the psychology of tribal life by descriptions of events and persons, together with the use of direct speech in the form of dialogue. In the same category of books is Rattray's (1935) "The Leopard Priestess." Perham (1936) has made a psychological study by analyzing the reactions of ten Africans to European influence. In French, Torday's "Causeries Congolaises" and R. Maran's stories are excellent. Since the Negro mind expresses itself in speech and action the mentality cannot remain totally inscrutable, so states B. Huss (1931), yet a fallacy may enter into this apparent truism. Thought, language, and actions are closely related in their development, and so intimate are they that an attempt to translate into the English language may give rise to many conceptions which were never a</page><page sequence="277">282 Source Book for African Anthropology part of the indigenous philosophy. In studying African religions, for example, English terms often fail to express the African connota? tions. Moreover, although the actions of persons and groups may be carefully studied, European interpretation of the motives behind the acts and institutions is likely to give rise to doubtful hypotheses. Europeans have been resourceful and ingenious in their explanations of indigenous African beliefs and ceremonies, but speculative phi? losophy is hazardous. J. A. Winter (1914) makes a practical approach to the study of native African mentality by considering trials in law courts accord? ing to the processes of Bantu law. He also deals with division of labor between the sexes, the effect of satirical songs, and the function? ing of a polygynous system. R. E. Dennett's "At the Back of the Black Man's Mind" (1906) is not a profound psychological study, but an approach to interpretation of Negro concepts by a detailed de? scription of rites and beliefs connected with the use of ceremonial objects, sacred groves, and magical practices. An explanation of a philosophical kind, which involves analysis and generalization, is given by Dennett in relation to certain religious concepts, but, gen? erally speaking, a reader is left to draw his own interpretations from the factual material. A very practical psychological study has been made by D.Crawford (1912), whose book, "Thinking Black," was written after twenty-two years of continuous experience in central Africa. W. M. Wundt (1916) is both practical and speculative. He considers numerous rites, beliefs, and material traits with a view to explaining origins and developments from the simple to the complex. In their practical analysis of the thought processes that underlie indigenous beliefs and the outward expression of these, B. Gutmann (1911) and P. Radin (1927) have examined folklore, songs, poetry, and proverbs. The former wrote of the Dschagga tribe of Kiliman? jaro, while the latter selected a broader basis for study, which included linguistic evidences of thought processes among North American Indians and the Maori of New Zealand. collective mentality The psychological technique of L^vy-Bruhl (1922, 1927, 1931) is a method of investigation founded upon broad geographical and ethnological studies. In fact, the philosophy is concerned with primitive man in general and is not confined even to one race or continent. On the practical side consideration is given to primitive man's attitude toward birth, sickness, accident, death, dreams,</page><page sequence="278">Psychology 283 omens, divination, ordeals, and the invention of myths as a rational explanation of natural phenomena. The researches of L6vy-Bruhl assert that the mental reactions of primitive man, when considered broadly, give evidence of the opera? tion of certain laws. For example, the Law of Participation, when operating, assumes a connection between two occurrences or condi? tions. These two factors, traits, or events, are regarded as cause and effect without there being any demonstrable connection between them. Linkage is of a magical kind due to the operation of forces and powers that cannot be understood, though they may be con? trolled to some extent by suitable ritual. Dr. R. R. Marett's (1907, 1911, 1935) consideration of the nature of taboos and the psychological content of religious experience are a part of the broad philosophical approach to social and psychological studies. E. D?rkheim (1912) has sought a general philosophy which shall explain certain psychological and social phenomena, such as social cohesion, and man's attitude toward forces of nature that control his life. D?rkheim has made generalizations respecting the psyche of a social unit. Individual ideas and the mentalities of persons are united to form a psychic whole. This mental entity is a social force, a superorganic, which is strong enough to secure social cohesion and to dominate the lives of all the individuals who constitute a social group, such as the village unit or the tribe. the unconscious mind A recent trend in psychological investigation has been the appli? cation of methods, which were primarily therapeutic and concerned with the content of the unconscious mind, to the explanation of ethnological data. C. G. Seligman (1924, 1928) and B. Z. Seligman (1934), with acknowledgments of the initial work of Jung and William James, have called attention to the existence of introvert and extra vert types of mind in normal individuals. Moreover, one of these mental types may be characteristic of a tribe or a still broader ethnic division. The Dinka look inward, and they are absorbed in their own cultural interests, to the exclusion of ideas resulting from con? tact with foreigners. On the contrary, many Negro tribes are recep? tive because of their extra vert disposition, which, as the name implies, enables them to look outward and to be receptive of new ideas and traits. But, even though such a classification may be explanatory of certain attitudes, one cannot be sure whether an innate type of mind has made the social environment, or whether the mentality is merely a product of physical environment and historical events.</page><page sequence="279">284 Source Book for African Anthropology Undoubtedly, these external factors must have a potent effect in shaping mass mentality and social attitudes. The researches of E. Jones (1924) emphasize the similarity of data resulting from investigations of anthropologists and psycho? analysts. In exploring the unconscious mind, over which the con? scious mind acts as a censor, groups of ideas, implicit beliefs, and attitudes, represent a stratum of mind which is more archaic than the one which usually manifests itself through normal behavior. S. Freud (1918) has shown that mental processes go on without the conscious self having any idea of their existence. Research in folk? lore and mythology explores this unconscious mind with a view to showing stages in early mental development. The conscious thinking of primitive man is said, to be more extensively influenced by unconscious factors than are the mental processes of sophisticated people. Psychoanalysis of the unconscious mind has led to the formation of hypotheses which help to explain certain sexual avoidances, religious concepts, methods of interpreting dreams, and the use of sexual symbolism by primitive people. Psychoanalysis has shown that in the minds of young children there exists a tendency toward sexual love for parents. This fact is thought by some psychologists to afford an explanation of the strict avoidance of certain relatives, and the existence of stringent marriage rules with definite prohibi? tions. In fact, the whole system of totemism and exogamy observed by many primitive tribes, who know the natural tendency toward certain forms of incest, is a striving to avoid incestuous relationships. Ideas of the extermination of self are inconceivable to the uncon? scious mind, and conscious life will not tolerate them, possibly because the thought of annihilation of ego is offensive to pride, and destruction at death means permanent severance from kindred. Possibly this fundamental and ineradicable fear of the destruction of self has led to the invention of beliefs in reincarnation, salvation, and immortality. Burial, in pre-dynastic Egypt, for example, often shows that the position of the corpse was determined by a definite belief in rebirth, for the bodies are placed in a fetal position, so suggesting a return to the womb. Thus runs one line of argument. Psychoanalytical study has further shown that constant repres? sion of certain ideas, sexual and otherwise, contained in the uncon? scious mind may lead to psychoses and ill-health. Two ethnologists have recently applied this idea to a study of anthropological data. R. S. Rattray (1928) has pointed out that in Ashanti an actor's</page><page sequence="280">Psychology 285 license permits subtle raillery against powerful persons. In the presence of a chief a person who is aggrieved abuses a friend with invective that in reality is directed against the chief himself. This practice provides a safety valve for repressed emotions. The func? tion of collective obscenities as an outlet for sexual desires that have been suppressed has been described by E. E. Evans-Pritchard (1929). He shows that the existence of appointed periods of sexual laxity, perhaps accompanied by saturnalian feasts, which have been usual in all parts of the world and at all periods, may really be instances of a conscious effort to avoid the deleterious effects of constant sup? pression and censorship. Other contributors to the psychoanalytic method are R?heim (1932, 1933, 1934), Malinowski (1924), Hersko vits (1934), and Bonaparte (1934). As a part of the psychoanalytic technique, dreams among back? ward people are now receiving attention, and the work done has been summarized by Lincoln (1935). This volume is a compre? hensive contribution to oneiromancy, a subject which will be referred to again in describing the functions of the medicine-man (section III). Lincoln makes a historical review of oneiromancy in which he distinguishes two main approaches to the study of dreams, (1) an animistic attitude, and (2) a rationalistic attitude, both of which have functioned jointly and separately in various times and places. He considers to what extent these attitudes prevail in existing primitive cultures. There is a dearth of African dream material for analysis, and in future such data should be collected with the following points in view: (1) Study of two principal dream patterns, namely, the "indi? vidual," "unsought," or "spontaneous" dream occurring in sleep, and the "induced" dream which is sometimes called the "culture pattern dream." (2) The function of the dream in primitive society, and the beliefs and theories about it. (3) The relation of the manifest content to the immediate culture. (4) The influence of dreams on primitive cultures, and the extent to which culture items have originated in dreams. (5) The forms and symbols of primitive dreams, together with their distribution and their constant or varying meanings. The inquirer wishes to know whether analysis of primitive dreams and symbols, with their associations, shows the same latent motives</page><page sequence="281">286 Source Book for African Anthropology and meanings as among people of more complex cultures. So far as the evidence goes, the psychological structure of primitive dreams appears to be identical with that of non-primitive dreams. Lincoln discusses the relationship between dreams, myths, and folklore and in doing so makes use of the researches of Freud, Selig man, Rivers, and Rank. Some of the concrete instances are selected from the writings of Rattray and other African ethnologists. A portion of the work is devoted to a survey of messianic cults and dreams, the medicine-man as a prophetic dreamer, and the inspira? tional dream as a creative force in literature, invention, art, and religion. the juvenile mind Widely distributed among primitive tribes, and common in the spiritual life of African Negroes, are animistic ideas which attribute a conscious life, and even a definite personality, to various animals, trees, and inanimate objects. M. Mead (1932) has reported her series of psychological tests among the Manus people of the Admi? ralty Islands. The tests were designed to inquire into the hypothesis that children have innate animistic tendencies, that are well pre? served and evident in primitive society until they are submerged by education and civilization, which substitute a knowledge of natural laws. Dr. Mead asks whether it is true that there survives in the thought processes and in the institutions of primitive man a type of mentality which is found to be characteristic of the minds of young children in civilization. Are there parallels between animism and the spontaneous thought of young children? The investigator observed children in ordinary social situations, collected drawings, asked for interpretation of the forms of ink blots, and asked questions that were designed to provoke animistic responses. The experiment failed to show that animistic thought could be explained in terms of intellectual immaturity. Another inquiry carried out by Mead is of great importance as a practical test of the psychological adjustments made during culture contacts, especially when there is a dominant and complex culture which is gradually submerging a simpler culture. The study of case records as carried out by Mead (1932) among an Indian tribe is one that would be of great service in many regions of Africa, where the new European culture is tending to submerge the old indigenous patterns. Case records should include an account of aged persons who have retained their own culture and are little affected by foreign intrusion.</page><page sequence="282">Psychology 287 And as a contrast with these the psychological study of individuals should include those who have left their own locality and culture for service among foreigners, and have not returned. These records should be compared with those of young persons who have found only temporary employment with foreigners away from home. Then to complete the study the inquiry should include young persons who, without leaving home, are making an adjustment to foreign rule within their own village. This subject is dealt with in more detail in section IV, under the heading of administration and native welfare. conclusion This summary of the methods of research into mentality shows that the inquiry is new and experimental; the field is unexplored. The most practical methods, and those of greatest utilitarian value in administration, are concerned with functional studies, the prepa? ration of monographs on tribal life, and the writing of ethnological stories recording character studies of persons and analysis of the social ethos. Of less immediate practical value are methods which seek to establish psychological explanations of conduct, philosophical generalizations, and quantitative measurement of ability. Yet the? oretical approach is a necessary accompaniment of the practical type of investigation which is of definite benefit to teachers and administrators, although the observed facts may remain to a great extent unexplained in terms of psychology and philosophy. In our present state of knowledge all pronouncements concerning mentality, its origin and possibilities of change, are unreliable, yet two truths emerge. In the first place, it will be wise not to assume certain innate, fixed, ineradicable mental endowments for particular peoples and tribes, because anatomically and psychologically the brain and mind are extremely plastic. Secondly, for the present, and pending further development of experimental technique, the best clue to a comprehension of mentality, both individual and col? lective, is a practical approach by study of historical background, modes of life, beliefs, institutions, culture contacts, and case records.</page><page sequence="283">VII. LANGUAGES AND LITERATURE Language and Culture Despite the tendency to speak of language and culture, a language is definitely part of a cultural pattern, perhaps the most important trait, since thought and language are so reciprocally related that they at once stimulate cultural growth and are in turn developed thereby. In the languages of tribes, no matter what their specific occupations may be, vocabulary is closely related to the mode of life. The value of linguistic evidence as an indication of physical and cultural miscegenation may, however, be overestimated. No cul? tural trait is more mobile than language; therefore, contiguous residence, trade, slavery, and warfare may lead to adoption of vocabulary, elements of grammar, proverbs, and folklore, without the mixing of physical characters by marriage, or the permanent exchange of cultural traits. It is important to note that climatic conditions may set definite limits to the use of certain elements of culture, such as camels, cattle, horses, canoes, weapons, wood carv? ing, and leather work. But the barriers against a mingling of linguis? tic elements are not so strongly operative. A few instances of the dissemination of a language through the agency of trade will serve to illustrate the mobility of language, and the fact that a transfer of linguistic elements may occur without extensive physical mixture or a general exchange of cultural traits. The Umbundu language, which belongs to the Bantu family, is understood in all parts of Angola and in places beyond the border, because the Ovimbundu were for several centuries renowned traders whose caravans were almost transcontinental. In east Africa Swahili is spoken over a wide area, and the language, which is a mixture of Bantu and Arabic (Werner, London, 1927, 1930b) is understood by many tribes who have their own languages and cultures. In west Africa Hausa is understood by many tribes in the region between Sierra Leone and Lake Chad. Mende, Efik, and Mandingo are other examples of "trade languages" that are widely used by tribes of different speech and culture. A modern problem that has recently engaged the attention of the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures, and with some success, is the preparation of a phonetic script suitable for representing the sounds made in all African languages, and the selection of basic languages that can be used for purposes of instruc 288</page><page sequence="284">COMPILED FROM MAPS OP - DELAfOSSC, W.3CHMIDT,G.BUSCHA*.

Scale: 1 inch-804 miles.</page><page sequence="285">Languages and Literature 289 tion in schools where scholars who speak various dialects are assem? bled (Westermann and Ward, 1933; Meinhof, 1928). Practical aims of this kind are associated with many academic and theoretical studies concerning the history of African languages, and the two types of research are complementary. To understand the nature of historical problems bearing on linguistic change one has only to recall the English of Chaucer and to compare this with modern English in order to realize the changes in grammar, phonetics spelling, and meaning of words that have taken place during six centuries. Such changes are progressing rapidly in America today. Preservation of examples of archaic speech can be found in rural areas, and even in the city of London Chaucerian English is pre? served in Cockney speech. In Negro Africa some blacksmiths preserve a speech that differs from their ordinary tribal languages. Priests and priestesses in charge of sacred pythons in certain localities of west Africa and Uganda speak archaic tongues during ritual performances, and in west Africa at the present day archaic forms of speech are preserved for use at meetings of secret societies. Further study of these sur? vivals will probably help to explain the nature of linguistic changes. But changes in linguistic form do not necessarily imply a long period of evolution, or devolution. R. S. Rattray (1932a, vol. 1, p. 50) says, "I have myself noticed marked changes in a language during my twenty years in Africa. Every unwritten language spoken in Africa is in this state of flux." R. M. East (1937) has discussed modern tendencies toward linguistic changes in northern Nigeria, and O. F. Raum (1937) has made a somewhat similar study for east Africa. Further research may prove that Pygmies of the Belgian Congo, who have great linguistic ability, had at one time their own language or languages which were gradually discarded in favor of various Bantu languages; the matter is at present undertermined (Ouzilleau, 1911; Schebesta, 1933, pp. 26, 250). Clearly, therefore, the rapidity of linguistic changes gives rise to new forms of speech and to a mingling of parent types of speech. Consequently each new formation leads farther away from the parental stem, and so the historical problem of tracing origins and relationships is rendered more difficult. Classification of Languages (Map 3) C. Meinhof (1906, 1929, 1932) expressed the idea that the linguistic unity of Bantu languages could be most easily understood</page><page sequence="286">290 Source Book for African Anthropology by presupposing a common origin for all the members of the large group. Research was directed toward the establishment of charac? teristic features of this original or Ur-Bantu, and attention was paid to both grammatical structure and phonology. A map of Bantu tribes and the distribution of language families is given at the end of Meinhofs (1932) "Introduction to the Phonology of the Bantu Languages." W. A. Crabtree (1917) states that he has found undoubted traces of Semitic influence in Bantu formatives and Bantu roots. He first noticed this coincidence when studying Hebrew. Crabtree gives phil? ological reasons for his belief that some of the roots and formative elements peculiar to Bantu were employed in a similar sense in the Sumerian tongue. Therefore, as in physical anthropology, or in studying the history of cultural traits, historical research in relation to languages becomes more and more retrospective in an attempt to establish phylogenetic relationships. For a junior student of African languages there are two books eminently suitable as a general approach to linguistic study. These are Sapir (1921) and Bloomfield (1933), both of whom discuss general problems of structure, historical relationships, and phonetic changes. As an introduction to the languages of Africa, the textbooks of A. Werner are to be specially recommended because of their clarity. Werner's (1930b) "Structure and Relationship of African Languages" and (1925a) "Language Families of Africa" might well form the first step to more difficult reading. Several contributions in German are particularly helpful in relation to the problem of linguistic classification and the study of changes. Von Koppelmann (1934) has dealt in some detail with the possible relationship of climate and speech, while Hestermann (1912-13) and Drexel (1925) have very thoroughly reviewed the tentative groupings and probable migrations of speech in Africa. As source material Werner (1930a) has produced a useful article, "English Contributions to the Study of African Languages," and Struck's bibliography (1908b) is of great value for those interested in the gradual evolution of linguistic study in Africa. In the bibli? ography of Struck one will find references to many early standard works and dictionaries, such as W. H. I. Bleek (1862, 1869), Cust (1883), Van der B?rgt (1903), Stapleton (1903). Struck's bibliography is of great service in familiarizing a student with the names of African languages and the localities in which they are spoken.</page><page sequence="287">Languages and Literature 291 A contribution by Mainguard (1934) is of service in outlining the nature of language and the various aspects that should be included in linguistic study. The main approaches to the understanding of the history and structure of a language are by way of phonetics, morphology, syntax, and vocabulary. Mainguard then deals very lucidly with the linguistic changes due to an impact of Bushmen and Hottentots, and of Hottentots and Bantu. For periodical literature three valuable sources in English, German, and French respectively are "Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies," London; "Mitteilungen des Seminars f?r Orienta? lischen Sprachen," Berlin; and "Bibliotheque de FEcole des Langues Orientales Vivantes." Since the year 1928 bibliographies have been published regularly in "Africa," the organ of the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures. These bibliographies are invaluable as a guide to all recent textbooks, dictionaries, and academic studies. An inquiry addressed to the secretary will bring expert advice on choice of books if the needs of the student are explicitly stated. Before proceeding to a further survey of African languages reference to Map 3 will be helpful, though the scheme is only tenta? tive; in the present state of knowledge there are differences of opinion. Yet the map serves its general purpose of showing the main linguistic areas and the hypothetical flow of Bantu languages from the Lakes region. Bushman Languages In the year 1837 Arbousset, a French missionary who came into contact with Bushmen, compared their speech to the clucking of turkeys because of the occurrence of numerous clicks. Clicks occur in Zulu and in Sandawe (D. F. Bleek, 1931; Dempwolff, 1916), but such sounds are more characteristic of Bushman languages than of any other speech. Early travelers have often shown a tendency to regard the languages of primitive tribes as simple and elementary, but the following brief analysis will show that, despite the simplicity of cultural patterns when compared with those of Europeans, the vocabularies, syntax, and phonetics of African tribes are complex. Bushman languages comprise several distinct divisions, a northern, a central, and a southern, all of which are related. Hot? tentots and Bushmen have a close resemblance in physique and language; but according to hypothesis certain linguistic and somatic traits of Hottentots are due to Hamitic admixture. The Nama Hot? tentots speak a language that has been affected by Hamitic forms.</page><page sequence="288">292 Source Book for African Anthropology In Bushman languages five significant tone levels occur, and one word may have five distinct meanings according to the use of a high, middle, low, falling, or rising tone. This semantic value is not peculiar to Bushman speech. Tonal values are extensively used in the Sudanic Negro languages, and to a much smaller extent in Bantu. In Bushman languages a dental click is made by pressing the tip of the tongue against the front teeth and withdrawing it suddenly. The cerebral click is produced by pressure of the tongue against the palate, followed by sudden removal. When making a lateral click the tongue is quickly withdrawn from the side of the mouth as in making the click that urges a horse. In addition to these clicks there are the palatal and the labial (see Anders, "The Clicks/' 1937). Consideration of Bushman languages of the southern group shows that the plural of a noun is formed by repetition of the word, and the meaning of a word may depend, not only on its tone, but on position in the sentence. In the language of the Naron Bushmen there are three genders, masculine, feminine, and common, each of which is indicated by a suffix. Thus, the word kwe means a human being, and the gender is common since no sex is indicated. But if the speaker wishes to mention that the human being was a man he uses the word kweba. The last syllable, ba, is a suffix indicating masculine gender. Similarly, by adding the feminine suffix sa to make the word kwesa, a woman is indicated. In Bushman languages other than Naron there is no sex gender, and the word for man or woman is used to qualify the substantive. Two forms for expressing number are recognized in the southern and the northern Bushman languages, and in Naron and the Hotten? tot languages there is a form to express duality. The idea of number is applied to substantives, to pronouns, and, in a few languages, to adjectives. The verb usually remains unaltered in form irrespective of the number of the governing substantive. In Auen the plural suffix is si. The word tnum means "a stone"; Inumsi is the plural. The sign / stands for an initial click. In English transcriptions of Bushman languages each kind of click, dental, labial, etc., is repre? sented by a distinctive sign. Three classes of persons are recognized by all the Khoisan languages. There is the person speaking, the person spoken to, and the person spoken about; these forms are indicated by personal pronouns, both singular and plural. In the southern group of Bushman languages there are inclusive and exclusive forms of per? sonal pronouns; that is to say, a pronoun may include the person</page><page sequence="289">Languages and Literature 293 addressed as well as the speaker, or the person addressed may be excluded. The Khoisan languages (Bushman and Hottentot) do not have verbal declension, and notion of time (tense) is expressed by use of the auxiliary particles. The rules affecting case, and the several usages affecting the order of words in a sentence are too complicated for enumeration here (Meinhof, 1930). The vocabulary of the Khoisan languages is very restricted with reference to abstract ideas. On the contrary, an extensive vocabulary is used to describe veld lore, wild animals, birds, trees, herbs, roots, and the technique of hunting. Comparison of vocabularies of Bush? man tribes shows that they have many words in common, and Nama Hottentot shares a large number of root words with one or another of the Bushman languages. Schapera (1930a, pp. 417-^138; 1926, pp. 833, 866) quotes evidence to indicate that Hottentot languages are shown by recent research to have closer affinities with Bushman than with Hamitic languages, though the Hamitic elements are undeniable. Sudanic Languages Sudanic Negro languages are distributed over a large zone extending from Gambia in far west Africa to a region west of the River Nile. To the north of the Sudanic area are the Hamitic and Semitic tongues of north Africa, and to the south are the Bantu languages; this juxtaposition has resulted in a mingling of different grammatical elements, to a greater or less degree according to locality. D. Westermann (1930) states that the relationship among the Sudanic languages themselves is less obvious than the inter? relation of the Bantu languages, whose affinities to one another can be readily recognized. The phylogenetic relationship of the Sudanic and Bantu Negro languages has been discussed by Westermann in detail (1927). In four groups of the Sudanic languages the affix system is well developed for dividing nouns into classes as in Bantu languages, but this feature may be of independent development, and the classes are not necessarily a proof of phylogenetic connection with Bantu. The main groups of the Sudanic languages (Westermann's 1930 classification) are given below: (1) The Kwa group is spoken from the middle of Liberia to the lower Niger. This group includes Ewe-Akan, Kru, Yoruba, Igara, Okpoto, Nupe, Ibo, Edo, Bini, and I jaw. Ewe is spoken in the extreme southeast corner of the Gold Coast, in the southern half of. Togo and Dahomey up to 8? N. Lat., and along the coast as far east</page><page sequence="290">294 Source Book for African Anthropology as Badagri. Kru is a Liberian language. The names Yoruba and Ijaw are descriptive of large tribes and linguistic divisions in Nigeria. The Ibo and the Ijaw can be regarded as the oldest repre? sentatives of true Negro stock. (2) The Benue Cross-River languages, with Efik and Ibibio as two representatives of the group, are located in eastern Nigeria. (3) The third group is in central Togoland. (4) Gur languages are spoken in northern Togoland and the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast. Subgroups in this division are Mosi, Dagomba, Kusai, Mamprusi, Gurundsi, and many others. (5) The West Atlantic group includes languages spoken in Senegal (Yolof and Serer tribes), in Portuguese Guinea, and by the Temne and Bulom tribes. (6) The Mandingo and Mande languages comprise a large number of subdivisions that have been described in detail by Delafosse (1929). (7) At the eastern end of the Sudanic zone the most important languages are Shilluk, Dinka, Nuer, and Zande. The division of African languages into Hamitic, Semitic, Sudanic, Bantu, and Bushman is convenient for the present. Such classi? fication is justifiable since each main group has distinguishing and definite characters, yet the possibility of remote generic relation? ship of all the languages should be kept in mind when the character? istic features of any one group are under discussion. With further research the terminology may be improved. The Sudanic languages have traits that serve to give definiteness of character, and they have a recognizable morphology in which the following features are prominent though not invariable. In the first place, the Sudanic languages are monosyllabic and isolating, and in this they differ fundamentally from Hamitic and Semitic, which are highly inflectional. Sudanic languages are built up from certain basic units of speech: nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Some parts of speech, instead of being inflected to express gender, number, tense, and degree, are actually changed in form (not merely inflected). Or the unit of speech may preserve its form but receive another position in the sentence in order to mark a change of meaning. Finally, the high, middle, and low tones are used to distinguish differences in meaning of words that are otherwise alike. Tonal values are well developed; but word stress is absent. In showing the genitive (possessive case), the name of the possessor precedes the name of the thing possessed.</page><page sequence="291">Languages and Literature 295 Since there are no relative pronouns, complex sentences are not constructed; the arrangement is said to be coordinative. The sentence, "He jumped from the ship into the sea," would be rendered, "He jumped, he left inside of ship, he fell to sea." Despite this apparent simplicity of structure and the absence of inflection, fine shades of meaning can be conveyed in some Sudanic languages. R. S. Rattray (1932a, vol. 1, pp. 61-63) mentions the expression of various conceptions of past and future in the Dagbane language. The particle de denotes immediate past, sa refers to events of yester? day, and da conveys the idea of a past more remote than today or yesterday. In the same way. an immediate future, a future limited to tomorrow, and a vague future can be expressed. No passive voice can be expressed in Sudanic. "The horse was killed by Musa," becomes, "It is Musa; he killed the horse." The following examples will illustrate the way in which changes of meaning are achieved in Sudanic languages, despite the absence of inflections. In Ibo, which is spoken in several dialects near Onitsha in Nigeria, the syllable bu means "carry" and da means "fall." Then by combination of these the word buda, "bring down," is made. A few examples from Ewe and Yoruba will indicate the dependence of meaning on tone. An acute accent indicates a high tone, and a grave accent shows a low tone. In Ewe, da means "throw," d?, "crawl." Do means "say," and dd, "be sad"; do on a level tone means "sleep." In Yoruba agba on a level tone means "rope"; dgbd means an "elder," and agba, "cannon." The meaning of dpo is "a post"; opo is "a window," and opo is "to be busy." Gender may be shown in this way: ako means male, and abo means female. Therefore, ako-esin is a stallion, and abo-esin is a mare. In the G? language china-nu means "bull," and china-yo means "cow." Plurals have usually to be judged by the context, but in Nuer singulars and plurals of nouns are known by different tones. In the Tshi group syllables are brought together to change verbs to nouns. Wu means "to die," from which the word awn, "murderer," is obtained. Bo means "to worship," and abo is "a worshipper." The Lautbilder described by D. Westermann are sound pictures that frequently occur in the Ewe language. Zo-ka-ka means "to walk upright"; zo-boko-boko refers to the heavy walk of a fat man; and zo-lumo-lumo describes the pattering run of small animals.</page><page sequence="292">296 Source Book for African Anthropology For the further study of tones in Sudanic speech the articles of A. L. James (1923,1928) are important for Yoruba, those of Schober (1933) for Ewe, and I. C. Ward (1933) for Efik. Herzog (1934) should be consulted for an article on "Speech Melody and Primitive Music," and these contributions should be read in conjunction with those of Nekes (1911a, 1911b, 1928) on the subject of musical tones in Bantu speech. For general study of the character of Sudanic speech con? tributions by I. C. Ward (1935,1936), Migeod (1913), N. W. Thomas (1920a), and Westermann (1935a) are of great service. Delafosse (1929) made a noteworthy study of the Mandingo language, and a bibliography of the writings of Delafosse will be found in Fligelman (1931, pp. 283-286). Lukas (1936) has written on the "Linguistic Situation in the Lake Chad Area." Hambly (1935a) has a bibli? ography containing many items of linguistic interest for Nigeria. For study of languages of the southern Sudan Struck (1928) has provided a bibliography, and A. N. Tucker (1934) has reported on the present linguistic situation in an article which includes a tribal map. For the Nilotic languages, which are still imperfectly known, G. W. Murray's (1920) article will prove useful. An English-Nubian Com? parative Dictionary by G. W. Murray (1923a) gives excellent examples of the mixture of linguistic elements in Nubian. The language is Sudanic, with Hamitic and Semitic elements. Some Greek words are present because Nubian was the language of the early Christian church of Nubia. Appendix II is a valuable bibliography of Semitic, Hamitic, and Nilotic studies. Bantu Languages The word Bantu, introduced by W. H. I. Bleek (1862-1869), is derived from ba, a plural prefix, and ntu, meaning "a man." The name is given to a large linguistic family that includes at least two hundred and fifty languages and an undetermined number of dialects. Despite diversity of vocabularies, and some morphological differ? ences, considerable uniformity of structure exists among languages of the Bantu family. Similarity of root words in regions far apart may be observed in H. H. Johnston's "A Comparative Study of the Bantu and Semi-Bantu Languages." This work classifies Bantu languages into groups that are based mainly on similarities in roots and vocabularies. In addition to Meinhof's (1932) map of Bantu languages a classi? fication of Bantu-speaking tribes has been made by Schapera (1929a), and by Van Warmelo (1935) for the Bantu of south Africa. Tessmann</page><page sequence="293">Languages and Literature 297 (1932) has written an account of Cameroons languages and has prepared a map of distribution for that area. But CM. Doke (1933, 1935b) states that up to the present time the Bantu languages have been classified geographically rather than philologically, and that further study is required to give a more satisfactory grouping according to structure. Some of the main characteristics of the Bantu languages are as follows: Nouns are divided into classes which vary in number according to the particular language under consideration. A noun class can be distinguished by a typical singular prefix which is changed to another prefix to form a plural. These prefixes form alliterative concords with their associated adjectives and pronouns. Bantu nouns have no grammatical gender. The genitive requires that the name of the thing possessed shall precede the name of the possessor. There is distinct word stress; for example, on the penultimate syllable in the tribal name Ovimbundu. Tones, which are high, middle, and low, have a semantic value; they distinguish the meanings of words which are otherwise alike. Bantu has formative elements to express case and tense, and the Bantu languages are said to be agglutinative, whereas Sudanic is isolating, and Hamitic and Semitic are inflected. A few examples from Umbundu, the language of the Ovimbundu of Angola (Hambly, 1934a, pp. 234-261) and from Zulu (Doke, 1931b) will indicate the structural devices that are used to convey ideas of gender, tense, and number. In Umbundu the word omunu means "a person." This is a class I noun which requires the prefix oma to form the plural; omanu means "persons." In class I.a is the word ufeko, "girl," which is changed either to afeko or to ovafeko in the plural. In class II the word uta is "a gun," which becomes ovota in the plural. Alliterative concord between a noun and the qualifying adjective is seen in utima utito, "a small heart," which has in the plural ovitima vitito. Concord must be observed between a noun and the possessive pronoun; therefore, ocitunyu cange, "my pit," or literally "pit of me," becomes in the plural ovitunyu viange. Uti wove, "tree of you," becomes in the plural oviti viene, "your trees," literally "trees of you." Verbs and pronouns illustrate further points of syntax. The stem of a verb is seen in the imperative singular; for example, tunga means "build." "I shall build the house" is translated by ndi tunga onjo. "You will build the house" is o tunga onjo, and "They</page><page sequence="294">298 Source Book for African Anthropology will build the house" is va tunga onjo. Merely the personal pronoun is changed. The suffix isa is causative; therefore one might say va tungisa onjo, "They caused the house to be built." The prefix oku is a sign of the infinitive, as in the forms oku lia, "to eat," and oku tunga, "to build." The semantic value of tones is not so prevalent in Bantu lan? guages as in the Sudanic, nevertheless Bantu tonal values are important (Hulstert, 1934; Nekes, 1911a, 1911b, 1928). In Um bundu the following words depend on tone for their meaning. The word ombambi (low tone) means a "cold" or "fever," but on a high tone the word means "bush buck." Onjila can mean a "bird" or a "path." Ombumbi is a "gateway" or a root used in brewing beer. Tones shift in bringing a noun into concord with a qualifying adjective. The grave accent shows a low tone, and the acute accent a high tone. The word uti means a "tree," ?t% ?nene is a "large tree;" dlweyo, "broom," becomes dlweyo luwa, "good broom." In the introduction to his Zulu Grammar C. M. Doke (1931b) points out that Bantu languages may be classified in two main groups: (I) with dissyllabic noun prefixes, and (II) with mono? syllabic noun prefixes. Zulu belongs to the former group. Zulu is not a pure language, for clicks have been adopted from Bushman languages. The three clicks in Zulu are the dental, palato-alveolar, and lateral. In Zulu two types of stress exist, a main and a secon? dary. If emphasis is required on a particular word, a change in the order of the words is usually made. In Zulu, tone is semantic and a nine-tone system exists; that is, the range of speech covers nine different pitches. The tones are of two main types; level, and gliding. In the following examples the highest tone is marked (1) and the lowest tone (9): 3 2 9 3 3?8 8?3 umuzi, kraal umuzi, grass for mats In Zulu, tone has a grammatical significance: 6 6 6 6 3 9 ngihlanza, i wash ngihlanza, i washing Tonal change expresses emphasis: 6 3 9 4 1 1?2 mkhulu, he is big mkhulu, he is very, very big Zulu has eight class genders, each of which has its own charac? teristic prefix which requires a certain change to mark the plural. In proto-Bantu each class of nouns had a definite significance which is still recognizable in certain classes of modern Zulu. Class I is the personal class. Class VII is the abstract class, and the division</page><page sequence="295">Languages and Literature 299 contains nouns expressing collectivity. In Class II the singular prefix is umu, and the plural is imi. In Class III the singular prefix Hi becomes ama in the plural. Gender is indicated by addition of a suffix: imbuzi, "goat," and imbuzihaze, "she goat"; inj a, "dog," and injakazi, "bitch." In addition to the substantive, Doke describes pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, conjunctions, and interjections. Each pronoun is itself a complete word which may stand instead of a noun, or it may be used in apposition to a noun, either before or after the noun without inflection. Adjectives qualify substantives with which they are brought into concordial agreement. Adverbs indicate time, place, and manner. Many nouns are used as adverbs without any inflection. Except in the imperative and the infinitive a verb is composed of two parts: (1) a verb stem which may undergo various inflections; (2) subjectival verb concord, which may alter for certain classes in different moods and conjugations. A verb in Zulu is divided into two conjugations, a positive and a negative. Each conjugation has seven moods: infinitive, imperative, indicative, dependent, situative, potential, and intentional. The indicative mood has tenses dividing time into remote past, immediate past, present, immediate future, and remote future. Hamitic and Semitic Languages The Hamitic and Semitic problem, with special reference to origins and lines of dispersal, has been discussed by G. A. Barton in "Semitic and Hamitic Origins." In opposition to prevailing hypoth? esis which makes Arabia the home of an ancestral Hamitic-Semitic group, he arrives at the conclusion that philological evidence favors a hypothesis of Hamitic origin in north Africa. There is great variation in the vocabulary and structure of Hamitic languages as a result of Hamitic migrations. On the contrary, Semitic languages resemble one another so closely that it is clear that the ancestors of those who spoke them must have dwelt for a long time in close association and isolated from foreign influence. Hamitic languages are older than Semitic. Barton (p. 26) postulates that ancestors of Hamites and Semites developed in north Africa, and that Semites are derived from a Hamito-Semitic stock that entered Arabia from Africa by the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb. The ancient Egyptians and Libyans spoke Hamitic tongues, and at present the Tamashek language of the Tuareg, and the Berber speech which is widely used in north Africa, are based on ancient</page><page sequence="296">300 Source Book for African Anthropology Hamitic languages. Differentiation has taken place unceasingly, with the result that several distinct forms of Berber and Tuareg languages have been formed. These languages are similar, and both, in varying degree according to locality, have been affected by Arabic (Semitic). Oric Bates (1914, p. 74) gives a list of forty Berber dialects, and he provides a useful summary of the views of Basset (1921), Renan (1873), Hanoteau (1896) and many other linguists respecting the relationship of ancient Libyan to modern Berber and Tamashek languages. A comparative study of the symbols of Libyan, T'ifinagh, and Punic is made (Bates, pp. 87-89). Bertholon (1912, vol. 2, pp. 503-518) speaks of the Hamitic sub? stratum of ancient Libyan, Egyptian, modern Berber dialects, and Tamashek. The present-day Berber tongues show traces of Negro vocabulary, Arabic, Nordic, Greek, and Latin. Destaing (1920) has published a vocabulary of Berber dialects. "Berber" is a cor? ruption of a Greek word that was originally applied to persons who were neither Greek nor Roman. The word has no relation to the terms Berberines, or Barabra, which are applied to certain inhabi? tants of Nubia, an area to the east of the middle course of the Nile. The Berberines speak a Sudanic language. Hausa, for which F. W. Taylor (1922) has written an elementary grammar, and Bargery has published a standard dictionary (1935), is widely spoken in west Africa. Hausa is primarily Hamitic, though it has tones like those of the Sudanic Negro languages, and some Semitic roots are present. C. Meinhof (1912) classes Fulani as proto-Hamitic, and the position of this language has been discussed by Drexel (1928). A further example of linguistic mixture may be observed in the oasis of Siwa (Basset, 1921), where descendants of ancient Libyans preserve elements of old Hamitic speech corrupted by Arabic and Tamashek (W. S. Walker, 1921, Cline, 1936a, p. 8). In northeast Africa, Hamitic languages are spoken by the Somali, Galla, and Danakil. Masai also is Hamitic, and some Hamitic elements have affected the speech of the Shilluk, the Dinka, and the Nuer, who have languages that are primarily of Sudanic Negro stock. In south Africa the Hottentot languages, for example, Nama and Korana, have both Hamitic and Bushman elements. In connection with the study of Hamitic languages, articles by Vycichl (1935) and Brockelmann (1932) will serve to introduce the problem of the relationship of Hamitic to other African languages.</page><page sequence="297">Languages and Literature 301 Modern Arabic is the most important of the Semitic languages of Africa, but some forms of old Semitic tongues are still in use. The Beni Amer of the Red Sea Province, who are Hamites, physically and culturally, speak Tigr?, which is a modern representative of Ge'es (Ethiopic), a relative of the ancient Sabaean of southern Arabia. Ge'es is still used for liturgies in the Abyssinian church. Amharic is a written language which is a descendant of Ethiopic (Semitic) modified by Hamitic (M. Cohen, 1936). Arabic, which has spread in Africa since the seventh century, has many local forms. In Morocco there occur a shortening of vowels, a clipping of terminations, and omission of syllables, when compared with standard Arabic. But some of the changes are not corruptions; they are rather survivals of archaic forms. A consider? able amount of bastard Arabic is spoken in the eastern Sudan (A. N. Tucker, 1934). Swahili of the east coast is a Bantu Negro language with many Arabic words in the vocabulary. A. and M. H. Werner's "First Swahili Book," 1927, 2nd Ed. 1930, is an excellent introduction to the study of Swahili; a bibliography introduces the student to more advanced works. Of practical importance to those beginning a study of Arabic language and literature are Willmore's (1927) "Handbook of Spoken Egyptian Arabic," and Gibb's (1926) "Arabic Literature." The work of Gibb provides a bibliography, and he surveys Arab literature from pre-Koranic times to the year a.d. 1800. The book gives a brief summary of the history of the Arabs in Africa, Persia, and India. Renan's (1863) "Histoire des langues s&amp;nitiques" is a well-known classic. Cohen (1924), and others in "Bibliotheque de L'Ecole des Langues Orientales Vivantes" have made contributions to the study of Semitic languages. The Semitic languages are fully inflected by prefixes, suffixes, and vowel changes, and Semitic, unlike Hamitic, has triliteral roots. As the name implies, these triliteral roots consist of three parts, examples of which are seen in the Arabic qatala, "he killed"; nasara, "he helped." In the Hamitic languages semantic tones are not usually present ; but Hausa, Nama Hottentot, and Masai are exceptions, for in these tongues certain words, which are otherwise alike, have different meanings according to tone. In some Hamitic languages, for example, Shila and the Rif dialects of Morocco, stress thrusts out vowels and makes harsh guttural sounds.</page><page sequence="298">302 Source Book for African Anthropology Hamitic languages are inflected to give grammatical gender, which is not so with Bantu languages, and in Hamitic, inflections are used to give tense and number; generally these inflections take the form of suffixes rather than prefixes. In Hamitic, case relations are usually expressed by a suffix. There are masculine and feminine articles, and also a form to express common gender. The two plurals are "collective" and "universal," both of which are shown by terminal inflections. Polarity is a feature of Hamitic languages; that is to say, nouns that are masculine in the singular take feminine terminations in the plural, and vice versa. The verb usually precedes its subject. The genitive (posses? sive) is the same as in Bantu; the name of the thing possessed is mentioned before the possessor, for example, "house of you," instead of "your house." The chief characteristic of the Hamitic and Semitic languages in comparison with the Bantu, Sudanic, and Bushman, is their high degree of inflection for the expression of number, gender, tense, and voice. A few examples of inflection are given below. Inflection for number is seen in Ieslema, "a Mohammedan," Ieslemen, "Mohammedans," and Ieslemen-t, "the Mohammedan world." This example is from Khamir, a Hamitic language of north Abyssinia. In Hausa the word sariki means a "king" or "chief." The "chief's wife," or "the king's wife" is sarikya; the feminine has been expressed by a change of termination. Similarly in Hausa yaro means "boy," and yarinya means "girl." In the genitive, a change from masculine to feminine is seen in the words "king's son," expressed by yaro-n-sariki, and "the king's daughter," which has the feminine form yarinya-t-sariki. In Arabic, a change of voice is shown by internal inflection. Thus qatala, "he killed," is active voice, while qutila is the passive voice, "he was killed." Writing (Table 9) I.

Of these scripts, Egyptian and Arabic are the most important. The former, first as hieroglyphs, then as cursive writing, gives a detailed history of social and religious development in Egypt from at least 3500 b.c. onward. Arabic later takes up the story of events in north Africa, the Sudan, and the east coast from a.d. 700 to modern times. Events of Abyssinian history are recorded in Amharic, while Greek, Roman, and Coptic have preserved historical records for late Egyptian and north African history. Yet these chronicles leave by far the greater part of African history unrecorded. As a general introduction to a study of African script Hoffman (1895) and Mason (1920) will be found useful. The beginnings of Egyptian writing are unknown, but six thousand years ago pictures were used to represent words, and this cumbersome method evolved into a cursive hand called hieratic, which in turn gave way to demotic. Each change represented a simplification and a further conventionalizing of the original hiero? glyphic characters. In the hieroglyphic system, a draughtboard set with pieces meant a game of draughts, but at a later stage in the development of Egyptian writing the same drawing conveyed the idea of "being set." The pictograph had developed into an ideograph; then came a phonetic stage in which the written character appealed to both the eye and the ear of the reader. Thus, a picture of a human arm primarily meant an arm; later, the syllable heb, "arm," could be represented by the picture of an arm to stand for the sound heb in any word in which that sound occurred. An ingenious use of symbols known as determinatives was combined with the use of phonograms, and at the end of the word a picture was added. For example, at the end of the phonograms giving sounds for the word "woman" a kneeling figure of a woman was drawn, to avoid making mistakes in the interpretation of the phonetically spelled word. At the end of the phonograms for the word "eating," a picture showing a man with his hand to his mouth was added. In Table 9, example I A, a hide with tail attached is a * determinative for the word "mouse." By the second century of the Christian era the Egyptian language was represented in Greek characters, though some demotic signs</page><page sequence="301">Languages and Literature 305 were retained, and two hundred years later, Coptic, in which parts of the Bible were written, was generally used (Table 9, example VIII). The Egyptians themselves attributed the origin of their writing to the god Thoth, who is represented with a pen and a writing tablet. Rationalizing by means of explanatory myths is usual among people who wish to explain the presence of certain important cultural elements. The Egyptians had stories to explain not only the invention of writing, but the apparent journey of the sun, eclipses of the moon, and other phenomena. No reason exists for supposing that Egyptian writing was imported from outside Egypt, though the speech contains triliteral roots, which are characteristic of Semitic tongues, and there are Hamitic features as well. Decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs and other forms of writing did not begin until the year 1802, when a trilingual inscrip? tion in Greek, hieroglyphs, and demotic was deciphered from a slab known as the Rosetta Stone. Since that time scholars have con? centrated on the translation of inscriptions from monuments and papyri. Oric Bates (1914) states that no inscription in Libyan characters has yet proved older than the fourth century b.c. The chief center of Libyan culture was west of the Nile, and the dispersal of culture was westward to the Canary Islands. Study of Libyan inscriptions (Table 9, examples II and III) leads to the conclusion that the Libyans adopted characters from Phoeni? cian script, and to these signs they added enough owners' marks to make an alphabet, which despite its crudity was adequate for their needs. Libyan inscriptions are read from below upward, beginning usually with the right-hand column. More rarely the inscriptions are horizontal; then they are read from right to left (M?lix, 1892; Bertholon and Chantre, 1912, vol. 2, pp. 503-518). Bertholon and Chantre have prepared a tabular statement in six columns showing the similarity of some symbols used in T'ifinagh, Libyan, Cretan-Egean, Cypriote, Archaic Greek, and Etruscan. Chantre points out that the most ancient traces of Libyan writing are rock inscriptions, possibly funerary, and some of these are per? haps as early as the Neolithic period in north Africa. According to Chantre, the history of our study of Libyan characters is traceable to the discovery of a bilingual inscription on a stone found at Dougga in the seventeenth century. As a source book for the study of Libyan and Punic, Chantre gives the "Revue Africaine" (especially Tome 4, pp. 154-237), published by the Soetet? Historique d'Alger.</page><page sequence="302">306 Source Book for African Anthropology Some Libyan characters have been incorporated in T'ifinagh, the script in which Tamashek (Temajegk), the language of the Tuareg, is written. F. R. Rodd (1926, p. 267) states that Ifadeyn Tuareg, both male and female, still read and write Tamashek. They use the script for messages and for inscribing records of visits on trees and rocks. Some present-day writing of the Tuareg (Table 9, III) is composed of personal or tribal marks grouped together; but the difficulty of deciphering inscriptions in T'ifinagh is due to the fact that they may be written to read up or down, from left to right, or from right to left. H. R. Palmer (1932) connects T'ifinagh script with the Sabaean characters of south Arabia and those of the Ethiopic alphabet. He believes that the Tuareg first entered the Sahara, a.d. 300-600, bringing camels from the eastern Sudan. Amharic, an ancient Semitic tongue, has been the official written language of Amhara, the central province of Abyssinia, since a.d. 1300. Amharic is written in Ethiopic characters (Brauner-Plazi kowski, 1914, Cohen, 1936), but the use of this language has been too restricted to assist with general problems of African history (Table 9, IV). Arabic (Table 9, V A and B) is now the official language of Egypt and many parts of north Africa. The history, philosophy, religion, poetry, and folklore of the Arabs are contained in many books and manuscripts, and Arabic is used in modern newspapers of Egypt. Historical documents and correspondence in Arabic show an ornate style. The former begin with, "In the name of Allah, the com? passionate, the merciful/' and the latter have a complimentary introduction, "To the Great and Glorious Governor, peace be unto thee, and the mercy of God and his blessing." On the outside of the folded paper may be written, "To reach, if it please God, the hand of ... ;" then follows the name of the recipient. In Mohammedan schools children may be seen seated on the ground before their mallam, who instructs them in writing Koranic texts on smooth boards with ink and reed pens, after which the texts are chanted in unison (Fig. 61). Arabic is used for writing Hausa, Mandingo, and Swahili, but E. Steere (1908) states that Arabic characters will never be able to express the sounds of Swahili. The reason for this is that Swahili has five vowels and Arabic has only three. Arabic supplies no characters for the Swahili con? sonants ch, g, p, or v. The Vai of Liberia, who are ethnologically part of the Mandingo people, have a script that Koelle of the Church Missionary Society</page><page sequence="303"></page><page sequence="304">308 Source Book for African Anthropology traced to the independent invention of Bukere, a Vai who died in the year 1850. Bukere stated that he had a dream in which a white man appeared and explained to him the use of writing. Bukere then noted all the sounds in the Vai language and gave to each sound a sign. Inspection of the 160 characters indicates that these are of independent origin; the script does not appear to be related to any system of calligraphy, African or otherwise. An editorial note in HAS, vol. 1, 1917, p. 292 gives important data relating to the history of the Vai script, and a facsimile of the first published script is shown. The Vai signs have changed in form and number to some extent since their invention, but they still provide a script that has been used for writing parts of the Bible and the Koran. The characters are mainly geometrical, but some pictographs exist. A circle with dots for eyes and a stroke for a mouth represents a human head, while a stick and twisted lines symbolize fire (Migeod, 1909; Mas saquoi, 1911; Klingenheben, 1933; Johnston, 1906, vol. 2, pp. 1116 35). For a sample of Vai characters see Table 9, example VI. When the chief Njoya of the Bamum tribe of Cameroons was a youth of sixteen years, his father became interested in books, chiefly the Koran, carried by Hausa traders. In later years Njoya instructed his officers to invent signs to express sounds in their language, and from this collection he chose the most useful symbols. Njoya purchased slates and made himself a teacher of the script, and Malcolm (1920b), quoting Goring (1907), states that six hundred natives were able to read and write the new characters. Njoya kept a record of events in this script, and he used it for keeping tally of purchases. H. H. Johnston, in his preface to Malcolm's article, states that the Bamum script resembles Vai writing, and that some of the signs are trade-marks from packing cases, and with this opinion L. W. G. Malcolm agrees (Malcolm, 1920; O. G. S. Crawford, 1935; Labouret, 1934b). In the year 1905, T. D. Maxwell, District Officer at Calabar in east Nigeria, discovered a secret primitive writing among the Efik. The characters are to some extent pictographic, though the signs have become so conventionalized that their meaning is not apparent. The script takes the name of a powerful secret society, Nsibidi, to which only chiefs might belong. Messages were sent in Nsibidi (Table 9, example VII), whose characters were cut or painted on palm stems. The characters of this script are painted on the faces of girls by their female relatives. P. A. Talbot (1912, p. 320) states</page><page sequence="305">Languages and Literature 309 that "sometimes a girl's life history is proclaimed in this manner." The Ekoi assert that the script was taught by monkeys who sat round their campfires. Certain signs represent a trial before the courthouse, which is shown as an oval, while the executioners are indicated by five symbols, each formed like a letter T. This script is used for writing complete stories, some of which are shown by Talbot in pictures of Nsibidi accompanied by translations. Articles by Macgregor (1909) and Dayrell (1911) give further information about the script Nsibidi. Proverbs The wit and humor of brief sententious sayings can be illustrated by examples from Hamitic and Negro languages. These aphorisms, riddles, and proverbs are used to point out a moral, to impress children, or to give point to an argument, and in addition there may be some latent content that gives veiled expression to sexual or other ideas which are usually suppressed. The Tuareg, whose lives have been associated with raids and reprisals, express mistrust in the proverb, "It is better to see than to believe." Other aphorisms that are relevant of their mentality are: "It is better to conceal than to refuse"; and "Noise and the chase do not go together." The following are proverbs collected from a district west of the Cavally River, which divides Liberia from the Ivory Coast. These and many similar ones are used by five tribes collectively known as the Gweabo (Sapir and Blooah, 1929; Herzog and Blooah, 1936). The palm tree says, "We do not know the child of wealth by his size." The meaning is that the largest palm does not necessarily give the greatest weight of nuts; the appearance of a person is not a reliable indication of his wealth. If a stranger is presumptuous, he is reminded of his position in the village by the proverb, "A stranger's feet are small," a sentence that refers to the bartering of chickens. These birds find themselves in new places among strange and possibly hostile poultry; therefore, the new arrivals have to step warily. Impecunious people express optimism in an expression which is attributed to a frog who said, "I possess nothing, but I have my jump." R. S. Rattray (1928, p. 304) asked some people of Ashanti whether they did not protest when the king used false weights to his own advantage when weighing gold dust. To express the danger and the futility of protesting against royalty the people quoted their proverb, "One does not rub bottoms with a porcupine."</page><page sequence="306">310 Source Book for African Anthropology The Ibo of Nigeria say, "When a traveler reaches a land where men cut off their ears he cuts off his own." This is equivalent to the English, "Do in Rome as the Romans do." The proverb, "Charity begins at home," has a parallel in the Ibo saying, "It is the place a man lives in that he repairs." The proverb, "When you play with a puppy, he tears your clothes," means that "familiarity breeds con? tempt." (Basden, 1921, p. 283.) From the Ovimbundu of Angola, Hambly (1934a, pp. 253-254) collected a few brief sayings, some of which are quoted below: "You cannot tie a buck's head in a cloth; the horns will stick out." This means, "Murder will out." "A turtle cannot climb on a tree stump; someone has to put it there." The saying refers to inheritance of kingship which usually descends to the oldest son of the deceased chief's principal wife. But if this youth is foolish, another successor is chosen. Yet influen? tial persons may see their own advantage in aiding the foolish heir to gain office?the "turtle has been placed on the tree stump." In order to deride a person who makes threats or promises that he is unable to fulfill, the Ovimbundu say, "Hot water does not burn a house," or "Cold water does not make mush." The proverb, "A sleeping dog does not catch a hare," has a similar meaning. If two persons have a secret, the fact is expressed by saying, "They uncovered the pot, ate a little honey, and covered it again." As a warning not to be foolish through good fortune, the Ovim? bundu say, "If you are full of food, do not climb on a leopard's back." The implication is that, although you yourself are not hungry, the leopard may have a good appetite. Understanding of some proverbs depends entirely on a knowledge of local customs. The aphorism, "That which destroyed the buck came from its own head," may appear meaningless until we recall the custom of blowing a horn to attract the attention of antelope. If the curiosity of the animals is aroused they will stand still or even approach the sound. "I caught some fish but lost my bracelet," is quoted when a loss in some transaction exceeds the gain. The saying would be appropri? ate if a man gave up his occupation and accepted work for lower pay. In a riddle which asks what object in the hut is like a human life, a certain philosophical trend may be seen. The answer is, "The log that is gradually pushed into the fire." Like a human life, the log is being consumed while it lives. Considerable material for study will</page><page sequence="307">Languages and Literature 311 be found in the pages of Gutmann (1909); Lindblom (1935); Meinhof (1911); Schapera (1932a), and Junod and Jaques (1936). Folklore Although stories are told for amusement among all Negro tribes, no African tribe, Negro or otherwise, is without mythology, folklore, and fables. These expressions of thought and emotion cannot be regarded as mere diversions. Careful study of story and myth shows historical facts, makes a revelation of ordinarily concealed mental processes and attitudes, and gives evidence of the relation of culture to literary expression. Let us consider a few tales which exemplify some of these points. Stories most commonly heard among Negroes are those relating to the adventures of animals, and although these may be primarily concerned with quaint humor they bring out clearly several main principles connected with the growth of folklore. In addition to their agricultural and pastoral pursuits the Ovim bundu retain important elements of a hunting culture. The close observation of animal life which is necessary for successful hunting has resulted in the acquisition of a large and specialized vocabulary relating to nature lore of all kinds. Stories distinguish species of mammals, birds, and reptiles with great precision. A second point of importance is the didactic nature of stories revealing the results of conceit, cowardice, and selfishness, while extolling the virtues of hospitality, bravery, and modesty. The tortoise constantly plays the part of one who is despised and ignored, yet he frequently proves more than a match for adversaries who underestimated his ability. The hare is symbolical of persons who exercise their wits to the detriment of others, but he overreaches himself and is frequently punished. The origin of etiological tales may be associated with the opera? tion of curiosity and fear. Naive stories take the place of natural science and of explanations that are based on the known sequences of causes and effects. As a consequence of differences in the premises of primitive man and of modern science, the respective conclusions are at variance. An excellent series of explanatory myths relating to earthquakes has been published by B. Struck (1908a). These stories clearly show the curiosity of Negroes who desire to explain natural phenomena, and the reasoning applied is in harmony with a general background of beliefs in ancestral spirits who influence the lives of the living.</page><page sequence="308">312 Source Book for African Anthropology why the bat flies by night The story of why the bat flies by night is of the simple explana? tory type. The tale is widely told in Africa, though local versions differ, for example, in Angola and Nigeria. Yet all the different tribes who use the tale find in it an amusing explanation. Undoubt? edly some of the explanations were at one time believed, as, for example, in ancient Egypt, where a dignified mythology explained the origin of the Nile, the rising of the sun, and other natural phe? nomena. But one does not suppose that African Negroes of today believe implicitly in tales that satisfied their forefathers. We still speak of "the man in the moon/' but without any faith in the existence of that interesting person, hero of juvenile stories. The Ovimbundu say that the child of the Sun was sick. The Bat was an ocimbanda (medicine-man), so the Sun sent for him to cure his child. The Bat arrived without delay, effected his cure, and returned home. At the time, the Sun was grateful, but his debt to the Bat was soon forgotten. Presently the son of the Bat fell ill with a sickness for which the Sun was a clever ocimbanda. The messengers from the Bat, who asked the Sun for help, arrived after the Sun had arisen. "Go! Tell your master I cannot help anyone after I have started my journey across the sky," he said. The messengers returned, only to find that the young Bat was dead. The Bat declared, 'Til never look at the face of the Sun again," and for this reason he hangs his head downward in a dark place all day. the story of the cricket The story of the cricket which is told in Angola is of the amusing type of animal fables having no didactic, explanatory, or other purpose. The Cricket was very quiet; he did not talk too much or quarrel with other people. One day he invited several animals to dig in his field and promised that he would give them some beer. The first helper to arrive was the Rooster, who drank a pot of beer. While drinking the beer, the Rooster looked out and saw the Wild Cat coming toward the Cricket's home. The Rooster was so afraid of the Wild Cat that he hid under the bed. The Wild Cat received a pot of beer, but he had hardly consumed it when he saw the Dog coming toward the house, so he hid under the bed. While the Dog was drinking, he saw the Hyena of whom he was afraid, so he joined the Wild Cat and the Rooster under the bed.</page><page sequence="309">Languages and Literature 313 No sooner was the Hyena comfortably settled than he saw a man with a gun approaching, so he disappeared under the bed with the other animals. For a long time the man sat drinking beer and talk? ing to the Cricket; meanwhile the animals under the bed were safe so long as they kept quiet, and they were too frightened to quarrel. Suddenly a cockroach fell from the ceiling to the floor of the hut, and this so excited the Rooster that he dashed out and gobbled the cockroach. The Wild Cat then forgot that he was hiding and attacked the Rooster. The Dog followed the Wild Cat, and then the Hyena attacked the Dog. There was a terrible noise as the animals fought in the middle of the floor. The Wild Cat killed the Rooster. The Dog killed the Wild Cat. The Hyena killed the Dog, and the man shot the Hyena. When the Tortoise arrived he was alarmed at the sight of the dead bodies so he sent for the Hare named Kandimba. The Hare dug up the Cricket from the hole where he was hiding, and he was killed by the Hare and the Tortoise, who blamed him for the death of all the animals. These stories from Angola are excerpts from Hambly (1934a, pp. 248-252) and many others for the same region may be found in Chatelain (1894). culture heroes Some of the most instructive examples of historical mythology occur among western Negroes, for example, the Yoruba of Nigeria. Officials of the royal household orally preserve records of historical events and genealogies, which are handed down for centuries. Con? sequently, at the present time a combination of fact and fable exists, not merely for amusement but for the welding together of social and religious institutions. At If? in southern Nigeria, I obtained three well-carved wooden masks which are ritual objects linking past events and dead heroes with the present life of the Yoruba. The masks represent Jogbo, Elebiti, and Fopo, about whom are grouped many important his? torical events, mingled with exaggerated tales of their personal prowess. These wooden masks function annually in a festival known as the Egungun, at which these and other national heroes are sup? posed to revisit the living. This type of active, functioning mythol? ogy is abundant in both Ashanti and Dahomey. A. B. Ellis (1890) relates stories combining historical facts with legends which must be pure invention. The elements relating to wars between Dahomey and Abeokuta are substantially true, but other factors relating to</page><page sequence="310">314 Source Book for African Anthropology a python god, who caressed the faltering soldiers with his tail and encouraged them to victory, represent the accretions due to lapse of time and the constant repetition of the story. The religious system of the Shilluk of the upper Nile is a living example of the energizing power of myth, history, and extant ritual, all of which are brought to bear on the economic life, which centers in pastoral pursuits. Nyakang is now a culture hero who must be regarded as historical, though the period at which he reigned is not known. Tradition states that he did not die, but vanished in a wind, and divine honors are now accorded to him; Nyakang has become a god with whom rainfall, welfare of cattle, and other marks of prosperity are associated (Westermann, 1912; Hofmayr, 1925). The manner in which mythology is created may be seen by studying the life of Mohammed, a historic person about whom many stories accumulated. Some relate to the Prophet's interviews with the angel Gabriel, who communicated the teachings of the Koran; other stories tell of Mohammed's conquest of jinns and affrits (Irving, 1911). Disentangling the elements of a myth is often an ethnological, psychological, and historical study, but zoological considerations may help in explaining the origin of some tales, especially those relating to serpents (Hambly, 1931a, pp. 68-73). folklore and culture contacts Some examples of mythology, especially from north and west Africa, give evidence of the combination of two distinct cultural backgrounds, the Negro and the Semitic. The Semitic elements relating to jinns, bori, and affrits may be studied from the writing of Robertson Smith (1901, pp. 120, 133, 168), and the combination of these traits with those originating among Negroes is observable in stories collated by A. J. N. Tremearne (1914). In "Der schwarze Decameron" (Frobenius, 1910) are tales of the Semitic, Arabian Nights type; but in these occur elements that have originated in the Negro culture of west Africa. The folklore of the Hoggar Tuareg (Haardt and Dubreuil, 1926) provides another example of the relationship between history, ethnology, and literary expression. The Tuareg are of Hamitic extraction, and much of their cultural history has been associated with that of Semites and Mohammedan Arabs. But Negro slaves have been imported from the Sudan, and their entry into Tuareg society has had both social and literary effects. Tuareg stories relate</page><page sequence="311">Languages and Literature 315 on the one hand to jinns, and on the other hand to simple stories of animals and their adventures, such as are told by Negroes. The jinns are usually invisible, but they may appear anywhere at will. On some occasions jinns are the invisible guests at a meal, and they may enter a house to substitute their children for those of mortals. A woman who is loved by a jinn will never find satisfaction in the embrace of a mortal man. Negro elements in Tuareg folklore are seen in the story of the lion and the jerboa; and in the tale of the jackal, the goat, and the hyena. theories about folklore Various theories have been advanced to account for the creation of myths and folklore stories. Occupation and ethnological back? ground, historical events, curiosity, sense of humor, fear arising from disturbing phenomena such as eclipses and earthquakes, have all played a part in the building up of an unwritten literature. Mythol? ogy is not always allowed to degenerate into a form of literary amusement, though it tends to do so with the advance of education and scientific knowledge. Yet in Africa at the present time instances can be found of mythology that plays an indispensable part in the social and religious life of a tribe. To some extent myths result from mental processes, sexual and otherwise, in the working of human minds that are functioning at a juvenile level. Incestuous tendencies may find expression in the creation of characters who play a promi? nent part in stories. The theory that some tales result from an expression of wishes that cannot be fulfilled contains elements of truth. Suppressed factors may relate to sexual desires, injustices suffered at the hands of powerful persons, and failure to attain wealth or position. The invented story may be a means of escape from the unhappy result of these suppressed elements. But no one theory will account for all types of stories, and in making analysis of some particular myth or group of myths that conform to a type, all the historical, ethnological, and psychological factors should be considered before a hypothesis is formed. A balanced view of the relative importance of all these factors that govern the creation of literature can be preserved only by consider? ing the theories of several exponents, each of whom is prone to lay too much emphasis on his own explanations. Among the names of those who have studied folklore, fable, and mythology from different points of view are Marett (1920); Lang</page><page sequence="312">316 Source Book for African Anthropology (1897, 1901); Rank (1914), who gives a psychological interpretation of mythology; Ehrenreich (1910), whose theories lean to an ethnologi? cal explanation of the contents of mythology; and Freud (1918), whose theories of the suppressed mental content and indirect escape from this suppression have many adherents (chap. VI, Psychology). Von Baumann (1936) treated African myths of the creation and origin of men in a valuable contribution to the study of etiological and historical stories. E. W. Smith (1932) refers to African tales told for amusement and for oblique expression, such as satire on important persons, as explanatory of natural phenomena (etiological), and as a means of indirectly forming moral attitudes (see also Rattray, 1928, pp. 1-11). reading As further sources of folklore, of which there is now enough for psychological analysis and classification, the following will be found useful. The selections have been made to cover a large area, and in addition to these specific contributions to folklore, a few stories will be found in almost every ethnological monograph mentioned in the bibliography of authors' names. Two principal contributions to the folklore of the Bushmen are those of W. H. I. Bleek (1864), and of W. H. I. Bleek and L. C. Lloyd (1911). Well known writings on Bantu folklore are those of R. E. Dennett (1898), E. S. Hartland (1914), E. Steere (1906), G. M. Theal (1882), J. Torrend (1921), and A. Werner (1925b, 1933). Semitico-Hamitic folklore may be studied in the works of C. G. Howard (1921), who has produced a book of Shuwa Arabic stories, in two volumes of Hausa folklore by R. S. Rattray (1913), and in a substantial contribution entitled "Wit and Wisdom in Morocco," by Westermarck (1930). The folklore of Sudanic (western) Negroes is presented in the contributions of R. C. Bundy (1919) for Liberia, A. W. Cardinall (1931) for Togoland, E. Dayrell (1910, 1913) for Nigeria, and by R. Prietze (1911) for the mid-western Sudan. Songs and Poetry Songs, which are often improvised and spontaneous, are an important form of literary expression. Negro carriers, canoe pad dlers, and women who take part in village dances are remarkably gifted in making extemporaneous verses to which all respond in choruses. On some occasions the verses are satirical and corrective in their attack on the adulterous, the dishonest, and the greedy. But these legitimate social functions of the songs are at times abused,</page><page sequence="313">Languages and Literature 317 for instance, in ridiculing those who are sexually impotent. Men have their war songs, women their refrains which are chanted as they pound grain, and children have ditties appropriate for their games. The value of songs may be considered from three points of view: as social controls (sanctions), as esthetic, and as historical. The song quoted below, which is an example of esthetic expres? sion, was composed by a Pokomo woman of northeast Africa, when her imagination was aroused by the sight of a fish eagle. Hear him calling there on the tree Flapping his wings and shaking his head! A brave and comely bird is he With his shining plumes so bright to see. As I went down to the river bed Bearing my water jar on my head, I saw him on the kurubo tree. Another Pokomo composition recorded by Werner refers to the flight of a flock of birds: Wheel and shine, Wheel and shine, Bird of mine. Over the plains My black cranes, Fish in the waters After the rains. Herons also all in a row All among the lilies, See where they go White flowers ablow, Blue flowers ablow, All in Shaka Babo After the rains. A war song of the Acholi, given by Driberg (1930, p. 38), has some stirring passages and the composition is rich in figures of speech. We are poured on the enemy like a mighty torrent; We are poured like a river in spate when the rain is in the mountains. The water hisses down the sands, swirling, exultant, And the tree that stood in its path is torn up quivering, It is tossed from eddy to eddy. We are poured on the enemy and they are bewildered; They look this way and that, seeking escape, But our spears fall thick about them, Our spears cling to their bodies and they are routed. They look this way and that for deliverance, But they cannot escape us, the avengers, the great killers. A selection of poetry and songs for comparative study of style, meter, purpose, and latent content should include Rattray (1934) for Hausa poetry, and Haardt (1926) for Tuareg verse. Norton (1918-19) and Seidel (1896) have given information about African</page><page sequence="314">318 Source Book for African Anthropology melodies in general. For Negro songs and poetry of west Africa, Witte (1906) has provided examples in Ewe, and Bufe (1914) has an article on poems of Negroes of Duala in Cameroons. As examples of songs and poetry from east Africa Von Hornbostels (1909) Wan yamwezi songs are important, as are those of Kidney (1920-21) from Nyasaland. As representative of Bantu expression in South Africa, Winter's (1912) "Hymns in Praise of Famous Chiefs" should be read. Norton (1919, pp. 122-137) has analyzed some South African tunes and has transcribed them in tonic sol-fa. The place of music in the education of children and as a form of social expression is dealt with in more detail in section III, chap. II. Sign and Whistling Languages In ethnological literature, references to whistling languages in Africa are rare. A. W. Cardinall (1927a, p. 273) describes the way in which a man whistled for his tobacco pipe and told the messenger in whistled tones exactly where the pipe could be found. Cardinall, quoting H. Labouret (1924), states that a whistling language is used by men of Lobi and Builsa. Rattray (1932a, vol. 1, p. 173) mentions a whistling language in the Ashanti hinterland. Most Negro tribes have some form of sign language which they use for expressing numbers that are indicated by various posi? tions of the fingers. Gestures to denote anger and contempt are common, while certain actions are used to communicate with deaf persons. Hand signs to express number among the Ovimbundu are typical of similar systems among Bantu and Sudanic Negroes. The num? bers from two to ten are shown as follows: (2) Turn the little finger and the one next to it into the palm. (3) Turn three fingers into the palm. (4) Turn four fingers into the palm. (5) Turn four fingers of the left hand into the palm, then tap the left thumb with the index finger of the right hand. (6) Extend the left hand and place the little finger of the right hand on the thumb of the extended left hand; this action adds one to five. (7) Proceed as for the number six, but touch the thumb with the little finger and the next one to it. (8) Place the little finger, the third finger, and the middle finger on the thumb of the extended left hand; this adds three to five. (9) Lay four fingers of the right hand on the thumb of the left hand. (10) Clap hands. An insulting sign is made by holding up the left arm with the fist closed, while the left wrist is grasped with the right hand, and</page><page sequence="315">Languages and Literature 319 the left hand is shaken. My interpreter said, "This is done when a man is so angry that he can't find words." Bending forward the head and protruding the tongue means, "You're a fool." If the right hand is shaken in front of the face with the index finger ex? tended, a negative is implied. A nod of the head is affirmative. Drawing the index finger of the right hand across the mouth signifies completion, and rubbing the palms quickly has the same significance. "Go away" is signaled by extending an arm and flipping the fingers outward. To say "Come here" a scratching motion of the fingers would be made with the arm extended. Drama Among Negroes of Africa as a whole, stage entertainment is not well developed as a form of dramatic art. But among the Mandingo, the Hausa, and the Ibibio the public is entertained by marionettes, and the Mandingo have plays of a type that constitute a legitimate stage. The Mandingo stage play as described by H. Labouret and M. Trav61? (1928) is performed by a troupe which gives a ballet over? ture, a prologue, and a presentation of the artists, followed by a comedy of intrigue that involves humor, satire, and sarcasm. Labouret states that marionette shows were probably brought into west Africa from the north by caravans. In the year 1878, P. Soleillet saw a marionette show performed near Segu on the Niger, and Labouret states that Hausa showmen usually give marionette entertainments at Mohammedan festivals. P. A. Talbot (1923, pp. 72-86) describes marionette plays among the Ibibio of Nigeria, who have carved wooden dolls worked by men who hide behind a blanket screen. The dolls are supposed to be a mystery to women, who are not allowed to know the cause of the puppets' movements. Women are also supposed to be ignorant of the fact that ventriloquism accounts for the speech of the dolls. Talbot states that in former days these secrets were so jealously guarded that a performing troupe which inadvertently exposed the mechanisms of the marionettes was slain. The spectators who were responsible for the murderous attack were outraged by the revelation of these secrets to women. The Akan play performed by Ibibio showmen was one in which twenty wooden puppets took part. The manipulators and ven? triloquists were concealed behind a screen of blankets. An element of magic was introduced, for, "as each fresh mannikin appeared a</page><page sequence="316">320 Source Book for African Anthropology black cock was lifted up to touch it in order, so it was explained, to confer on the puppet the power of speech and movement." The puppets departed, with the exception of a father and his daughter-in-law. Talbot states, "The latter was dressed in a scanty garb of beads and bells, supplemented by only a dark green cloth, well above the waist line. In spite of a flirtatious manner and pro? vocative air, the person described above, after regarding the male performer in silence for some seconds, addressed him in a tone of reproof. 'Why/ she said, 'do you excite yourself? I know that I am beautiful but you must remember that I am not your wife/" Dr. B. Laufer (1923) states that in the third century of our era story-tellers recited in the public squares of Chinese towns, and their narratives were illustrated by transparencies. In this way arose the shadow plays that spread among Persians, Arabs, and Turks, then finally to western Europe. The first literary mention of marionettes was made about a.d. 630, at which time Turkestan swarmed with jugglers, mimes, and actors; and there is evidence to show that these performers knew the use of puppets. Figures of marionettes have been found during archaeological excavations on ancient sites in Egypt, Greece, and Rome. For Africa, Spies (1928) has described the shadow plays of Tunisia, and D. Alexander (1910) gives a brief note on a Punch and Judy show in Bornu. Symbolic Messages and Drum Language The Yoruba of Nigeria formerly used an elaborate system of messages. These were expressed by the use of cowrie shells com? bined with a variety of small objects, each of which had a symbolic meaning. One cowrie shell with a small hole at the back meant defiance. Two cowrie shells fastened face to face had the meaning, "I want to see you," but if the two shells were placed back to back, the message read, "Go away and stay away." The powerful Ogboni league, which still functions, used cowrie shells as symbols whose meanings were known only to the members of the league. Up to forty cowries the meaning depended on the number of shells used, the method of stringing, and the nature of the objects placed between the shells. A piece of charcoal meant that, as the substance was black, the prospects of the sender were gloomy. In the year 1852, when the Dahomeans captured Abeokuta, a Yoruban prisoner sent his friends a message in the form of a piece of wood such as Negroes use for cleaning their teeth. This message had the interpretation, "As I remember my teeth in the early morning, and during the day, so I</page><page sequence="317">Languages and Literature 321 remember you as soon as I get up, and often afterwards." (Bloxam, 1886; Gollmer, 1884.) A kola nut means welcome and peace, with good health. A morsel of sugar sent as a message means, "There is no enmity between us." In Dahomey a gift of parrots' eggs to the king was an invitation for him to resign, since his powers were felt to be inade? quate for sustaining the vitality of the state. Carved wooden sticks and ornamental paddles have been used by many Negro tribes as symbols of authority to be carried by messengers. Among Negroes two main types of drums are used for transmit? ting messages. The cylindrical drum, hollowed from a log and pro? vided with one or more rectangular slits at the top, is used by Sudanic and Bantu Negroes. This drum has no membrane and is best described as a signaling drum (R. T. Clarke, 1934, p. 34). Talking drums, male and female, provided with membranes, are of less frequent occurrence, and the best examples of the type are to be found in Ashanti (Rattray, 1923, Figs. 101-102) and in Togoland (Witte, 1910). Elaborate ritual is observed when wood and membranes are obtained for the drums used in Ashanti, and whenever the drums are used a preliminary rite is necessary to invite the spirit of the tree whose wood was used, and the spirit of the elephant whose ear was made into a tympanum, to enter the drum. The language conveyed by these drums is of the Sudanic family in which different tones alter the dictionary meaning of words that are otherwise alike. The phonographic records taken by R. S. Rattray (1923, pp. 242-286) indicate that the sounds transmitted are divided into groups of tones with clearly defined stops at inter? vals of varying length. Rattray's simplest description of the drum language is contained in a brief article (1922-23). A. N. Tucker (1936) has described "African Alphabets and the Telegraph Sytem." Transmission gives the tones, the number of syllables, and the punctuation, but the vowels and the individual consonants cannot be transmitted. Drummers make use of holophrases which are familiar to both senders and receivers. There are holophrases for a declaration of war, an outbreak of fire, and the approach of Euro? peans. In Liberia drum talking of this kind is used, and in Nigeria the Yoruba have drummers in the royal compound. When the king rises in the morning the drums announce the fact, and when the king is ready to leave his palace another holophrase is sounded. Exaggerated accounts have been given of the distance that messages can be sent. Undoubtedly messages can be heard several</page><page sequence="318">322 Source Book for African Anthropology miles away under favorable atmospheric conditions, but even though the message is relayed it must soon come to a borderline where a language differing from the one in which the message origi? nated is spoken. The holophrases are conventions that are under? stood in a limited area, and tonal languages differ so much that the sounds used for first transmission and subsequent relays would have no meaning when picked up by people speaking another language. Field Records Perusal of C. M. Doke's "A Comparative Study in Shona Pho? netics" shows that investigation of linguistic problems is the work of specialists, who are aided by delicate instruments in addition to specially constructed phonographs, or dictaphones. Apparatus is used for studying the function of the lips, palate, tongue, pharynx, throat, epiglottis, and larynx. To analyze the sounds of Shona dialects, Doke used vulcanite palates which are too thin to inter? fere with normal pronunciation. The palates are dusted with powder, and the marks (palatograms) made by the speaker's tongue are examined. For studying throat movements X-rays have been used. But without elaborate apparatus an investigator may accomplish useful work in field research by following the instructions contained in a "Short Guide to the Recording of African Languages," pub? lished by the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures. The Guide begins with a brief outline of phonetic symbols and conducts the inquiry by giving lists of key words and phrases, with blanks to be filled by the investigator. Even if unqualified as a linguist, a student can readily learn the use of a dictaphone for recording, and, given a little practice in technique by an expert, he will be able to bring home records of language and music that can be transcribed by specialists. But for really competent investigation the observer should have a natural aptitude and a trained ear, and should as a minimum be familiar with the theory and practice of phonetics as expounded by D. Westermann and I. C. Ward (1933). I. C. Ward (1937) has published a pamphlet of "Practical Suggestions for the Learning of an African Language in the Field." The amount of field work to be done is so extensive that one fails to see how the task can be accomplished by specialists only; they are so few in number. The quality of the records is far more im? portant than the quantity. Yet interested administrators, teachers, and missionaries, willing to take short courses in phonetics and the use of recording instruments, might supply the data which after labo? ratory analysis would clarify the linguistic problems now unsolved.</page><page sequence="319">Section II: The Culture Area Concept</page><page sequence="320"></page><page sequence="321">I. TOPOGRAPHY AND CULTURE Map 2, showing division of Africa into zones of desert, forest, parkland, and intermediate types of surface, should be compared with Map 4, illustrating the distribution of modes of life. No difficulty will be experienced in understanding these culture areas, since their demarcation depends primarily on all the geographical facts that control human, animal, and plant life. In each of the zones described, an impressive cultural homogeneity prevails, but the margins of typical cultures are not clearly defined, and each useful trait tends to extend itself so far as conditions per? mit. Within each cultural zone somatic and linguistic differences occur, and the characteristic culture itself has local variations. Division of Africa into cultural zones was first attempted by A. de Pr^ville, and his scheme was prepared to show causal relation between environment, products, and modes of life. De Pr^ville (1894) considers the different regions occupied by camel keepers, pastoral tribes, and agriculturalists, who produce maize, durra, rice, bananas, or other crops according to local climatic conditions. Dowd (1907) applied and misapplied the teaching of De Pr?ville. Dowd made some extremely broad generalizations concerning cor? relation between food and mental attributes. One would be led to believe that bananas engender a pusillanimous spirit, but a diet of millet fosters courage. That warlike tribes inhabited the millet zone is true, but the diet was not to blame. Many of those tribes are of Hamitic extraction, having a predatory military organization. Moreover, military expeditions are encouraged by the type of open country which favors the cultivation of millet. R. Thurnwald (1929) and M. J. Herskovits (1926,1930b) have followed the lead of DePr^ville in dividing Africa into cultural zones, but with somewhat different divisions and with additional explanations of the ethnological data involved in the scheme. Map 4 combines the schemes of these authors but makes additions and modifications. I have preferred to show the indefinite nature of boundaries by shading rather than straight lines. Explanation of Map 4 Area 1.?The Nile Valley, in which a highly specialized civilization was built up on a basis of Hamitic and Semitic culture. The civili? zation was affected by Persian, Greek, Roman, and Arab conquests. Area 2.?A region of migration of northern Hamites. Some of these were named Libyans, and later the name Berbers was given. 325</page><page sequence="322">326 Source Book for African Anthropology Into this region, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Moham? medan-Arab influences have penetrated. Cultural traits from area (2) have affected regions (3), (4), (5) and have extended into area (6A). Area 3.?The Saharan region of camel-keeping cultures is divisible on the grounds of physique, languages, and minor cultural differences, into (3A), Tuareg; (3B) Tebu Tibbu and Teda of Tibesti; (3C) Arabs of the Libyan oases. Area U.?A region of pastoral nomads possessing cattle, sheep, goats, horses, and perhaps camels also. Semitic and Mohammedan traits prevail. At the eastern end of the area the Kababish are a tribe whose culture shows a linkage between true Saharan culture and that of grassland steppes where cattle are reared. Area 5.?Parkland area uniting semi-desert country (4) with forest country (6A and 6B). The region is pastoral, but seasonal migrations are made to keep in touch with the rainfall. Horses are used, and formerly they were extensively employed in warfare. Camels are used seasonally for transport, but the area is not one in which breeding camels and organizing long-distance caravans are fundamentally important. Region 5A contains Nilotic Negro tribes of the true cattle culture; compare with area 7A. Areas 6A, 6B.?These are forest regions of Negro culture. The areas have many important cultural traits in common, but somatic, linguistic, and cultural differences are important. Area 6A is inhabited by Sudanic-speaking Negroes, and area 6B by Bantu speaking Negroes. Area 6B includes groups of Pygmies who have a type of hunting culture. These Pygmies live in a state of social and economic symbiosis with Negroes. Region 6A includes Ashanti, Dahomey, and southern Nigeria where there is a specialized development of religion, art, and social organization differing from the general pattern of Negro culture. The course of the Congo may be divided into thirteen minor regions: (a) Maritime; (b) Cataracts; (c) Stanley Pool; (d) Kwango; (e) Lake Leopold; (f) Kasai; (g) Eastern Region; (h) Equatorial; (i) Haut Ubangi; (j) Bangala; (k) Aruwimi; (1) Welle (Uelle); (m) Lomami Lualaba. This scheme is given (with no author's name) in periodical AMCB, Series III, Tome I, Fase. I, p. 4. The classification is that on which ethnographical collections are arranged in the Mus6e Congo Beige, Tervueren. Presumably this classification is based on differences in material culture, but doubtless these are accompanied by other and more important distinctions.</page><page sequence="323">Topography and Culture 327 Area 7.?This area has many cultural patterns whose predominat? ing trait is the breeding of cattle, which are important in religious belief and custom, in social structure, and in economic usage. Agri? culture is sometimes carried out by a class of people who are regarded as socially inferior to the aristocratic Hamitic population, which is pastoral to the exclusion of agriculture and industrialism. Regions 7B-7D are extensions of the typical cattle zone 7A, but agriculture without social stigma of those who till the soil, becomes important, and in some regions, for example, in central Angola, agriculture is primary and keeping cattle is secondary. Area 5A is a highly specialized center of the pastoral culture. Area 8.?The Kalahari Desert is the home of Bushman tribes having a type of culture in which hunting is the dominating factor. Agriculture is not practiced, and no domestic animals except the dog are kept. Development of handicrafts, social organization, and religious institutions are elementary. Most of the activities have to be concentrated on obtaining food and water. The arrows indicate a strong overlap of Mohammedan religion and its accessory traits along north Africa, across the Sahara into Negro west Africa and northern Cameroons. The Mohammedan complex of traits affects the whole of the Nile Valley, Kordofan, Abyssinia, Somaliland, and the east coast southward to Lourengo Marques. In view of the criticisms that have been advanced against a study of culture zones (Carter A. Woods, 1934) one cannot too strongly emphasize the factor of miscegenation. A culture area scheme is chiefly useful as a preliminary sifting and grouping of data. There are areas of concentration for camel-keeping, cattle raising, agriculture, and hunting, but each major factor tends to peter out and to become mingled with others. Then, superimposed on several types of culture is a widely spread Mohammedan influence, varying greatly in intensity from one region to another. Hambly has analyzed the culture areas of Nigeria (1935a) and of Angola (1934a), and Herskovits (1926) has dealt in this way with the pastoral culture. But too many ethnographers lose sight of regional grouping and merely present unconnected factual material. Subvarieties of Negro culture could be further defined by a re? arrangement of the data in Spencer (1930, Editor, E. Torday). The "Descriptive Sociology of African Races" has a wealth of material, but the arrangement is not in accordance with modern ethnological</page><page sequence="324">328 Source Book for African Anthropology method. A helpful memorandum in the study of cultural mixture is that prepared by Redfield, Linton, and Herskovits (1935). The scheme is too condensed to allow of summarizing, but a student will find there many helpful suggestions for the analysis of cultures, and for study of the social and psychological processes involved in what the authors call "acculturation"; an alternative term would be "cultural adjustment." A warning should be given against the assumption that study of a culture area consists mainly of enumerating the characteristic traits. The prevailing traits, and exchanges of these with traits from other areas are important, but the subject should be regarded from the social and psychological point of view, as in Benedict's "Patterns of Culture" and Mead's "Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies." The aim should be to give what D?rkheim called the "superorganic." Perhaps a better term is the "ethos," meaning the dynamic or driving force; the character, sentiment, and disposition of a community, the spirit which actuates moral codes, ideals, attitudes, magic, and religion. The ethos may be the Mohammedan religion, cattle and rain-making, or agriculture with fertility rites and other ritual. But no matter what the focus may be, this pivotal point must be understood; then all subsidiary factors fall into line. The following chapters explain the main types of culture, the ethos and subsidiary traits of each area, also the mixtures which have occurred.</page><page sequence="325">II. HUNTING CULTURES Bushmen Present-day Bushman hunters of the Kalahari Desert are but a fragment of the numerous Bushman tribes which extended over the region south of the River Zambezi a few centuries ago. This gradual restriction of habitat has resulted from the aggression of British and Dutch settlers, and an intermingling of Bushman tribes with Bantu Negro neighbors. The Kalahari Desert, having an area of 140,000 square miles, is not the barren expanse that has sometimes been pictured by those who have crossed in the dry season. Lack of moisture is the pre? vailing characteristic, and there are large areas of sand dunes, some of which attain a hundred feet in height; yet many depressions exist, and grass flourishes in these hollows where water may be obtained long after the season of rains has ended. In the Lake Ngami region and in the Okavango marshland game thrives. Bushman paintings and rock engravings testify to a varied supply of animal life. Among big game are kudu, wildebeest, buffalo, zebra, and elephant. These are not all generally distributed, but each has a peculiar locality and season which is known to the nomadic hunters. Bushmen rely for food, not only on big game, but on many forms of small animal life, such as snakes, geckos, termites, and locusts. Honey, various kinds of larvae, and edible roots also contribute to the regular diet. After the rains acacias attain a size sufficiently large to shelter game, and baobab trees (Fig. 7) harbor water in their spongy tissues (Verdoorn, 1933). Schultze (1907) gives an excellent description and pictorial survey of the Kalahari. The range of temperature from day to night is a wide one, from 120? or more in the sun almost to freezing point in the hours of early morning. Rain falls chiefly in October and November, with heavy precipitations, after which there is a long drought of ten months. Fitzgerald (1934, pp. 170-176) gives the rainfall as varying from 5 to 29 inches according to locality. The climatic conditions, there? fore, necessitate constant trekking to keep in touch with game and water. In the driest part of the season, tribes break up into small family groups of not more than six persons as a rule. A separation of this kind aids the location of food and water and therefore increases the chance of survival. 329</page><page sequence="326">330 Source Book for African Anthropology Habits of life have to accommodate themselves to environmental conditions, and among Bushman hunters mobility is a primary necessity. But in former years, when game was more plentiful and no pressure was exerted by white settlers, Bushman life may have been more sedentary. At one time tribes living in the south and east made use of caves and rock shelters, in which wall paintings and stone implements still testify to the development of a stone-age culture and an advanced technique in art (chap. Ill, Prehistory). In accordance with the requirements of nomadic life, shelters are usually of a temporary kind. At present, the Namib build homes of brushwood and bark whenever they camp for more than two days. This work is relegated to women, who erect the shelters a few miles from water holes, so that game will not be disturbed. The Naron (D. F. Bleek, 1928) build semicircular huts in the wet season, but are content with lighter buildings of sticks and grass when trekking. Reference to the works quoted will call attention to the cultural differences of various Bushman tribes, yet there is sufficient uni? formity of essential elements to warrant a general description of the modes of life. material culture Garments of skin are simple and scanty, but complete nudity is rarely seen. The usual dress for a male consists of a triangular piece of hide, two corners of which are made fast by a string about his waist while the third corner is passed between his legs and fastened to the waist string (Fig. 62). In addition to this pubic covering he may have a skin cloak (kaross) suspended from his right shoulder. A skin bag rests on his left hip, so providing a handy container for food, fire-sticks, and tobacco pipe. The covering of a woman includes a small skin apron that hangs from a belt; bead work ornament is the usual form of decoration for females (Fig. 47). Perhaps the equipment includes a kaross, which forms a pouch for an infant when the garment is tied at the waist, and the fold of the garment may also contain ostrich eggshells for holding water, edible roots, firewood, and dry grass. Strings of ostrich eggshell beads manufactured by women are the most valuable personal ornaments. Small pieces of eggshell are softened in water, pierced with a borer of iron or stone, threaded on sinew, and chipped to remove rough edges. Finally the beads are rubbed smooth with a soft stone, then they are threaded to make head-bands, girdles, and waist-strings. Both sexes wear arm- and leg-bands of leather (see bead forehead band, Fig. 47).</page><page sequence="327">Hunting Cultures 331 As a rule supplies of water are insufficient for washing the body; therefore, a smearing of fat is given, and this is followed by a dusting with buchu powder, which is made by pounding vegetable matter. Bushmen have excelled in pictorial art (chap. Ill, Prehistory) but little time is now spent on esthetic expression, and an inventory of personal possessions, all of a simple kind, is therefore brief. Each woman has a digging stick tipped with horn and weighted with Fig. 62. Bushman kneeling to shoot, Koatwe Pan, Kalahari Desert (from photograph by Arthur s. Vernay, copyright). a perforated round stone. With this implement she digs up wild roots and edible bulbs, since agriculture is not practiced. Wood fiber is twisted into cord for making snares and string bags, while the wood itself is manufactured into vessels, pestles, and mortars for the pounding and preserving of vegetable food. Fiber is also used in making mats for sifting ants' eggs. Water is generally carried in ostrich eggs some of which are engraved, but if these are not available the stomach of an animal will serve the purpose. Skins of animals are made into cloaks, loin coverings, sandals, caps, and bags. The carapace of a tortoise is often used as a spoon or scoop, and there appears to be no object or material too insignificant</page><page sequence="328">332 Source Book for African Anthropology for a useful purpose. Hammer-stones of rounded form are used for pounding seeds, and pointed borers of stone serve for perforating eggshells and engraving ostrich eggs. Smoking of tobacco, which is usual among men, women, and even children, calls for some ingenuity in making the equipment. Tribes of the northwest Kalahari make tobacco pipes of serpentine stone, and the Cape Bushmen used a water-pipe for smoking a mixture of tobacco and hemp. The pipe consists of a horn perforated at the tip, which is the mouthpiece, while the wide end is plugged with clay; from the side of the pipe a tube projects, ending in a stone bowl. The horn is filled with water; consequently, when the smoker sucks the pointed end of the horn he draws the smoke from the bowl through the water in the horn. Pipes and pipe bowls of serpentine are fashioned with a stone drill, or with the point of a knife or spear. Hiechware Bushmen practice ground-smoking, for which they prepare by making a hole for the tobacco which is covered with a dome of clay. From this bowl a narrow tunnel is made. The smoker has to lie prone to apply his lips to the tunnel leading from the tobacco (Laufer, Hambly, and Linton, 1930, Plate V, Fig. 2). The only Bushmen who know how to make intoxicating drink are the Namibs, who prepare liquor from honey, but drunkenness among Bushmen is said to be exceptional. Owing to the simplicity of life in Bushman tribes, division of labor cannot be so highly specialized as among more advanced tribes which have developed arts and industries to a high degree. Bushman males are hunters and preparers of hides. They are responsible for making weapons and fire-sticks, one of which is twirled on the other to produce fire by friction. Women build shelters, gather wild vegetable produce, fill ostrich eggshells with water, collect firewood, cook, care for children, and make their own personal ornaments. Some men and women are more skillful than others, but all understand these tasks, and special? ization is primarily on a sex basis and not according to special aptitudes or hereditary right, as among some Negro tribes. Iron is neither smelted nor forged, but iron tips for arrows are procured from neighboring Bantu Negroes and Hottentots. In time past the Cape Bushmen, also some Hottentots, made pottery (Laidler, 1929), but this is now a lost art. Some Bushmen may be seen with spears and throwing clubs, but these weapons have been obtained from Negro neighbors. Acquisition of objects such as weapons and pottery is not the only instance of adoption of elements from another</page><page sequence="329">Hunting Cultures 333 culture. Bushmen, who circumcise their boys and practice clitori dectomy on their girls, as do the Hiechware, have borrowed the rites from Bantu Negro neighbors. If possible, Bushmen practice fishing, and for this purpose they make funnel-shaped traps of reeds, weirs, and stone dams. In the Okavango basin live Bushmen who use boats and spears for fishing, but these are special local developments that are not characteristic of Bushmen in general. Most Bushman tribes have to combat a deficiency of water by filling ostrich eggshells and caching them, or by sucking moisture from the ground through a reed, the lower end of which is plugged with grass to prevent the entry of sand. Fig. 63 is an excellent illustration of Bushman women filling ostrich eggshells at a pool. The shafts of bows, which are short and round in cross section, are usually bound with sinew, and two strands of the same substance are twisted together to form a bowstring. Arrows vary considerably in different localities but the following are well-known types. The simplest arrows are made from hollow reeds about fifteen inches long and notched for reception of the bowstring. The arrowhead is made of wood or bone from the leg of an ostrich. Arrow-tips, which may be of stone, bone, glass, or iron, are inserted into hollow shafts from which they readily become detached on entering an animal. The northern Kung and the Heikum feather the wooden shafts of their arrows. Schapera (1927a) and Logie (1935) have given descriptions and classifications of Bushman bows and arrows. Poison is smeared on arrow-points, or, in the instance of flat bone arrowheads, it is dabbed in spots over the surface. For killing game, reliance is placed on the poison and not on the severity of the wound. Poison is prepared from substances derived from both vegetable and animal sources; thus, the juice of euphorbias, the venom of the puff-adder, and the crushed bodies of trap-door spiders are ingredients. These substances are used according to locality, but the resulting poison is generally a thick brown paste that is liberally smeared on the point and its junction with the arrow-shaft. After a quantity of the poison has been prepared by allowing it to simmer in a tortoise shell, a portion is at once applied to the arrow tips, and the remainder is carried in a skin bag. A wounded animal may travel as much as forty miles before suc? cumbing to the effects of the poison, but the hunter follows untiringly until he comes up with his quarry. Sometimes game is captured by running it down in open chase, or animals may be pursued by a</page><page sequence="330">334 Source Book for African Anthropology hunter disguised after the manner shown in Bushman paintings. Disguise of this kind is aided by the hunter's skill in making the calls of animals, and in imitating the cries of birds to arouse the curiosity of the quarry. The Naron hunt the jackal, leopard, lynx, hare, and small buck, with dogs. In the southern Kalahari, pits with pointed stakes at their bases are dug, and toward these traps animals are driven through a gap in a fence. The Namib fence a spring to prevent animals from drinking there; then a channel of water is made to flow to a pit that is poisoned with branches of euphorbia, a poison to which zebras are said to be especially susceptible. In the dry season, snares are made in the form of cords with running nooses. To prepare such a trap one end of the cord is made fast to a bent sapling, while the bait is so arranged that in seizing it the animal is caught in the noose, which tightens as the sapling springs upward. Fall-traps are made so that interference with the bait releases a heavy stone. Success in hunting is not thought to depend entirely on the prowess of the hunter; on the contrary, charms are used to ensure good luck in the chase. Some of these are permanently carried in the form of cuts on the arms, cheeks, or belly of the hunter. These incisions are usually made soon after a boy begins to hunt, and the instance of rubbing a wound with the flesh of a springbok to give the swiftness of that animal to the hunter is an example of contagious magic. The shadow of a hunter should not be allowed to fall on dying game, and when in pursuit of an animal a hunter must eat the flesh of a creature that moves slowly, for to consume the flesh of a swift animal would give speed to the quarry. Collection of wild vegetable produce, a task in which men some? times assist, is not without ritual observances. The Heikum Bush? men have a ceremony of the first fruits at which fire is made and food is consumed in ritual fashion. Once a year at the beginning of the rainy season, when edible plants are expected to appear, the !Kung pray to Huwe, a supernatural being, saying, "Father, I come to you, I pray to you, please give me food and all things, that I may live." social and religious life Music and dancing should not be regarded solely as amusements. Some dances are primarily social functions, but, on the contrary, other dances are of a ritual kind; for example those connected with hunting may have a magical significance for increasing the supply of</page><page sequence="331"></page><page sequence="332">336 Source Book for African Anthropology game, and some rock paintings suggest that in former times dancing and magical rites existed for this purpose. Professional musicians are unknown, though some men are more skilled than others. Musical instruments are of a simple kind. A skin stretched over a calabash or across a tortoise shell may serve as a drum. Southern tribes play reed pipes to accompany their dances, and in several localities the musical bow and the goura are used. The former is an ordinary bow to the string of which a gourd is attached, so that when pressed against the body of the musician the gourd acts as a resonator and amplifies the sound made by plucking or tapping the bowstring. The goura is also a bow having at the end of the stave a flexible quill that the performer causes to vibrate by his strong inspirations and expirations. Social organization and religion are not so easy to study as the material factors. In no Bushman tribe is there a complex tribal organization with a supreme governing body or person having legis? lative and judicial functions. Each tribe is a mobile and divisible unit consisting of an indefinite number of hunting bands, each of which splits up into small family groups who wander independently but later rejoin their main units. A hunting band probably contains about fifty persons. The leader of such a band holds his position in a non-elective and informal way as a result of prowess in the chase or success in combat with a rival band. In the northwest Kalahari, each band has, in addition to a leader who is spontaneously chosen, a formal chief whose office is hereditary, and though his authority may be slight in everyday life he regulates movements of his band and leads in war. The hunting territory of each band and the tribe formed by these bands are defined by natural features. A row of dunes, a water-hole, or a tree may serve as a boundary mark, and within the confines of its own territory a hunting band has exclusive rights to the game and water, together with wild vegetable produce. The infringement of hunting rights is a main cause of conflict. Within a family there is a permanent relation of husband and wife with their unmarried children, and these persons usually con? stitute a traveling unit, especially in the dry season when the band has divided. The Bushman system of kinship is imperfectly known. Laws relating to hunting rights, private ownership of property, and possession of a wife are well defined. A man who finds a nest of ostrich eggs marks the site with his arrow, and leaves the spot with the intention of returning when the clutch is complete. The</page><page sequence="333">Hunting Cultures 337 original finder would kill a man who robbed him, and with this object in view he would track the thief for a long distance. This personal revenge would be regarded as normal, but the relatives of the mur? dered thief would probably seek reprisal, and so a blood-feud would begin. Communal feeling respecting ownership of game, water, and wild produce does not extend outside a hunting group, and within the group itself common ownership is subordinated to a sense of individual possession of food, weapons, ornaments, clothing, and utensils. Obedience to customary law depends on conformity to precedents, since no formal codes exist. A father is the legal head of his family and in that capacity has rights of punishment. Among the Namib the eldest son becomes head of the family after the death of his father, and where tribal chieftainship exists succession to office descends to the eldest son. The available information, though inadequate, suggests that Bushman tribes generally favor succession in the male line. There is little property to dispose of, and the few personal possessions are generally buried with the dead. Burial rites have formed the subject of an article by Seyffert (1913). Formalities of courtship are observed among some tribes, who require a suitor to make presents to his future mother-in-law. During the year before his marriage he gives her game, skins, and beads. At marriage the groom provides his wife with a fur cloak, items of leather clothing, and bead ornaments. Among the Heikum Bush? men, parents say, "We are poor and cannot afford to give our daughter away." This message is carried tci the suitor by a friend who has been delegated to make the first approach. The lover himself then sits near the hut of his prospective bride and calls to her mother, "I want your daughter." Again the protest of poverty is heard. The suitor calls, "If you die, I will bury you." Should the mother agree to the match, she takes the bow and arrows of the suitor and places them in her daughter's hut. If the girl fails to come to this hut within three days, her mother is expected to compel her to do so because acceptance of the weapons ratified a contract (Fourie, 1928, pp. 81-104). After consummation of the marriage the husband lives for several months with his wife's kin, but later he builds a hut among his own kin, and there he takes his wife. The marriage is first matrilocal, then patrilocal. Sometimes the wife's kin make a show of resistance when the groom prepares to take his bride away. The interference appears to be a formal and ritual protest against depriving the</page><page sequence="334">338 Source Book for African Anthropology wife's kindred of a woman who is a potential bearer of children, and therefore a tribal asset. Among tribes of the northwest Kalahari a woman returns to the home of her parents for her first confinement. Possibly these examples indicate a former matrilocal condition under which a woman and her children resided permanently with the maternal kin. If adultery occurs, an aggrieved husband is allowed to kill the seducer and to beat his wife, but he may not inflict the death penalty on her. Women of the Heikum practice abortion if unmarried, and children born out of wedlock are buried alive. The period of lactation is about three years. Polygyny is permissible, but among tribes who live for a great part of the year on the margin of subsistence plurality of wives is unusual. Religious beliefs are difficult to investigate, and valuable oppor? tunities were lost before ethnological interest was aroused, yet several writers have been able to give at least an outline of spiritual concepts and their expression by prayer and ritual. Lebzelter (1928), and P. W. Schmidt (1929) have dealt specifically with Bushman religion in short articles. Religious thought of the Cape Bushmen centered in reverence for celestial bodies, especially the moon. A crescent moon and certain stars were asked for food: 0 star coming there, Let me see a springbok; 0 star coming there, Let me dig out ants' food. Stars are thought to have been animals and people far back in the history of the Bushman race. In the northern Kalahari the Naron and the Auen still worship the moon, who is regarded as an old man having a wife, the sun (D. F. Bleek, 1929). In mythology the mantis is the most important symbol, and he is personified as a man who has a wife and three children. This mantis being is able to transform himself into the shapes of other creatures. He may be killed yet comes to life again. The mantis is a creator, a giver of rain, and a dispenser of good luck in hunting. He protects his people from illness and disaster (D. F. Bleek, 1923). Offering of first fruits which are ceremonially eaten at the begin? ning of the rains, and creation of sacred fire by use of a twirling stick, are possibly imported rites. The former is usual among agricultural Negroes, both Sudanic and Bantu, while the latter rite is one of the main features of ritual associated with cattle. Use of the sacred fire is widely known among pastoral tribes of east, south, and South West Africa (Eiselen, 1929).</page><page sequence="335">Hunting Cultures 339 Magical ceremonies are of importance in connection with rain making. Among the Cape Bushmen male or female rain-makers went out to catch the rain bull, which was then led over the land to produce rain. Some magicians could transform themselves into animals, and others were able to cause illness by shooting invisible arrows. The Naron medicine-men are said to shoot arrows of this kind, which kill their victims by magic and not by physical injury. The employment of little bows of bone which are used by the north? western Bushmen is not well understood. The bow carried by them is only a few inches in length, and the arrows are thorns. Some magical significance of this miniature weapon is probable. In some tribes the power of a medicine-man is thought to continue after his death, and to such a spirit prayers for rain and success in hunting are offered. A few persons who do not claim to be medicine-men among the Cape Bushmen assert that they have a "beating of the flesh" which acts as a warning of impending events. From this sensation they profess to be able to announce the arrival of strangers or to say what route should be followed to find those who are lost. Beyond doubt magical practices are general, but the information does not warrant classification of medicine-men according to their functions. There is some evidence to indicate that certain medicine-men specialize in curing the sick, but most of the medicine-men appear to be general practitioners. A medicine-man when treating a patient sucks the affected part, gives massage, and pretends to remove a small stone which he spits from his mouth. Treatment of the sick is sometimes carried out with juices that have been extracted from plants by boiling. The juices may be drunk or rubbed into cuts on the patient's body. A medicine-man of the Auen attempts the cure of snake-bite by suck? ing the wound and rubbing it with a powder prepared from pulverized gall, liver, and poison sacs of a mamba mixed with the fat of snakes. But evidence respecting the alleged cure of snake-bites and the preparation of antidotes against arrow poison cannot be accepted with assurance. In the eastern Kalahari, bodies are buried in a contracted position in anthills around which fences of thorn-bush are erected to keep away jackals and hyenas. Ghosts are feared because they are thought to wander at night, but beliefs are conflicting. conclusion Bushman tribes differ in physique, language, and cultural ele? ments; likewise in the extent to which they have been influenced</page><page sequence="336">340 Source Book for African Anthropology by Hottentot and Bantu Negro neighbors. In view of these dif? ferences, W. Hirschberg (1933a) has asked whether there is a Bush? man culture. The answer must be in the affirmative. Funda? mental to the various forms of Bushman tribal life is a stone-age culture, a highly developed pictorial art, a paucity of material pos? sessions, a highly skilled hunting technique, absence of agriculture and domestic animals, and the possession of rudimentary dwellings. Social organization is of a flexible kind which harmonizes with a nomadic hunting culture, while spiritual beliefs and magical practices are not welded into a coherent system. Religious beliefs and rites are not institutionalized with that definiteness which is characteristic of many Negro tribes, but such rites and beliefs are clearly oriented toward the maintenance of food supply. The harshness of the climatic and ecological conditions make the factor of nutrition primarily important, and spiritual exercises are directed toward assuring adequate rainfall and pasture for the game on which the hunting community depends. reading In addition to references inserted in the text the following litera? ture is of primary importance since the reading makes a general survey of Bushman cultures in several localities. In German, Pas sarge's (1907) study is still important, but the work is now supple? mented by the general studies of Lebzelter (1934a, b). Immenroth (1933) has produced a compilation work comparing Pygmies and Bushmen, and this contains a large bibliography. Rodenberg (1931) has prepared a general survey of like kind dealing with herders, hunters, and food gatherers of South West Africa in their relation to the land and its produce. In English the survey of Schapera (1930a) brings together in critical manner all the available evidence for Bushman culture, and in a short article (1926) he discusses the cultural relationships between Bushmen and Hottentots. D. F. Bleek has published an article on Bushmen of Angola (1927), a short work on the Naron tribe (1928), and a series of articles on the !Xam Bushmen in Bantu Studies (1931-33). O. T. Crosby has contributed an article on the Bushmen and Ovambo (1931). Dornan (1917) made a study of the Tati Bush? men (Masarwas), and he has published an instructive travel book entitled "Pygmies and Bushmen of the Kalahari." A. W. Hodson's book "Trekking the Great Thirst," would form an entertaining introduction to more serious study.</page><page sequence="337">Hunting Cultures 341 Pygmies In a study of the hunting culture of Pygmy groups of the central forest region, the difference of their habitat from that of Bushman hunters is a factor of importance. The former live in the most densely wooded regions of Africa, while the latter occupy semi desert country. In both cultures, the occupation of hunting leads to the formation of temporary encampments, a flexible social organi? zation, and a splitting up into small family groups. pygmy and bushman cultures compared P. Schebesta (1932a) describes the Bambuti groups as a sub? merged class among Bantu Negroes, who regard the Pygmies with disdain. A horde of Pygmies is attached to every Negro village, and a Negro chief is patron over one or more groups of Pygmies whom he has inherited from his father, and whom in turn he will pass on to the custody of his son. This statement shows a fun? damental difference between the culture contacts of Bushmen and Pygmies with their respective Bantu neighbors. That Bushmen have adopted traits from Negro tribes has been recognized, but Pygmies form a much more permanent cultural liaison with their Bantu neighbors; in fact, the reciprocal duties set up a definite state of social symbiosis. Pygmies supply meat to Negroes and receive in return agricultural produce. As with Bushmen, a certain amount of miscegenation with Negroes takes place. Schebesta states that Negroes often take Pygmy women as wives, a procedure that upsets the sex ratio in Pygmy hordes; he does not state whether Pygmy men ever marry Negro women. Among the Bambuti, material culture has many points of close resemblance to the hunting culture of the Bushmen. Males are hunters whose chief weapons are bows and poisoned arrows. But spearing animals, together with the use of nets and many ingenious traps, forms part of the regular technique. Dogs, which are used in hunting, are the only domestic animals; this is also true of the Bushmen. Women, as among Bushman tribes, collect wild vegetable produce, carry loads from Negro villages, build huts of a temporary kind (Figs. 64, 65), cook, care for children, gather firewood, and draw water. With respect to water supplies, Bushman ingenuity is exercised to find supplies in a dry habitat, whereas the habitat of the Bambuti Pygmies has a heavy rainfall. Other important traits in the hunting culture of Pygmies and Bushmen are preparation of arrow poison, making fire by twirling, and collection of honey.</page><page sequence="338">342 Source Book for African Anthropology Reference has been made to the Bushman method of preparing arrow poison from animal substances such as crushed spiders, scor? pions, and the poison glands of snakes. Pygmies appear to depend for their poison on the juice of a liana. The poison is prepared by the community for common use, and not by each individual hunter. Lianas containing the poisonous principle are pounded to pulp in a wooden trough, and the juice is squeezed out by twisting the pulp in a rattan press. The arrow-tips are smeared with the juice and dried, first over a fire, then in the sun. Pygmies tip their arrows with iron points as do some Bushman tribes, but, like the Bushmen, they obtain these from Negro neighbors since the blacksmith's craft is unknown to them. Pygmies do not feather their arrows as Bushmen do, but fix a split leaf to the butt of each shaft. Simple skin loin coverings are the typical clothing of both Pygmies and Bushmen. Hunting territories for bands including several families, and hunting territories for tribes are recognized by Pygmies as they are by Bushmen, and infringement of hunting rights is a cause of con? flict. Among Pygmies, as with Bushmen, the family group is the basic economic unit. Game is divided by an elder of the family group, who distributes a portion to each of the restricted families. Even the man who killed the animal has no authority in the division. A family outside the clan (group of related families) may claim a share in the spoil if kinship with the clan can be shown. As with Bushmen, the Pygmies have recognized individual ownership. If a man gathers nuts, these belong to himself or to his restricted family. If a woman kills a snake, she may cook it for her own restricted family, but when common effort has been made all the families 6f a clan group share the food. An example of this communal effort and communal sharing is found in the use of large nets whose han? dling requires all the males of the Pygmy clan to snare the game. Among Bambuti Pygmies the clan is a group of Negro origin; each clan has a definite camping ground, hunting territory which can be used by all families of the clan, and a clan totem. Each clan recognizes some taboos respecting the killing and eating of its totem animal. Tribal unity hardly exists, since a tribe is divided into clans, each with a chief, and according to Schebesta there is no cohesion or central authority for the clans. Theoretically, the Pygmies are polygynous, but perhaps only one male in a hundred has more than one wife. If a Pygmy woman is dissatisfied with her marriage either to a Negro or to one of her own tribesmen she will return to her own family, and her clan will protect her under these</page><page sequence="339">343</page><page sequence="340"></page><page sequence="341">Hunting Cultures 345 circumstances. Exogamy in family groups is a binding regulation, and the rules of exogamy sometimes apply to clans, in which case a man or woman must marry outside his or her family and clan. Some of these social customs are undoubtedly due to Negro influence, and Schebesta states that among the Ef? Pygmies circumcision has been adopted only recently as a result of contact with Negroes. There is more information concerning religious beliefs and magical practices of Pygmies than of Bushmen. In connection with hunting several ritual acts occur. The night before Ef6 Pygmies hunt ele? phants all the women give a magical dance, during which they squirt water from their mouths to bring good luck to the hunters. Hunters run out from the dense copses and spear an elephant in the hind legs, after which mortal spear thrusts are made. A honey gatherer utters a prayer for success, and from the tree he tosses part of a honey? comb into the forest. Part of the heart of a slain animal is thrown into the forest as a libation. Charms associated with witchcraft are obtained from Negroes, and sores on the body are attributed to witches' spells. Schebesta (1931a) has published an article dealing solely with religious beliefs of the Bambuti Pygmies. Definite religious ideas are few. Worship of the dead, so strong in ancestral cults of Negroes, scarcely enters into the lives of Pygmies, yet Pygmies have a definite impression of the human soul as an entity distinct from the body. They call the soul bukahema, and say that at death it departs from the body as breath. If a person has been wicked the soul is cast into a fire. Souls of the good go to Mungu, a god who has the appearance of a man. Possibly some European influence is reflected in these beliefs. Pygmies believe in visits from ghosts. Schebesta gives an account of Pygmies who throw leaves on a fire to create a smoke that will appease spirits of a thunder? storm. There is, however, no evidence of well-developed beliefs which are coordinated and centralized in persons or institutions. reading Schebesta's contributions are the most substantial we have for study of the Ituri Pygmies, but several brief descriptions of Pygmies ought not to be overlooked. In the section dealing with physical anthropology, reference was made to the first descriptions of Pygmies by early explorers, Du Chaillu for the Gaboon, Junker, Schweinfurth, and Stanley for the Ituri. In addition to these, several books of a semi-popular kind contain useful accounts of Pygmy life. Among these travel books and general accounts, which are really very serviceable, are those of H. H. Johnston (1902b), Verner (1903),</page><page sequence="342">346 Source Book for African Anthropology Powell-Cotton (1904, 1908), Christy (1915, 1924), Bergh (1922), and Wollaston (1908). Schumacher (1927, 1928) has contributed accounts of the Kivu Pygmies in the eastern Belgian Congo. The culture as well as the physique of these Pygmies seems to have been considerably affected by contact with Bantu neighbors. An illus? trated article by Maes (1911) deals entirely with the material cul? ture of the Bambuti. Trilles' (1932) social studies of Congo Pygmy groups, other than the Ituri, is important for comparative study with data relating to the Bambuti. scattered hunting groups In addition to Bushman hunting culture of the desert type and Pygmy culture of the dense forest, we have G. W. B. Huntingford's (1929,1931) description of bands of hunters of the parkland country of northeast Africa. The racial affinities of these hunters are negroid, but the details of their phylogenetic connections and tribal history are unknown. They are, however, neither Bushmen nor Pygmies, though one group, the Dume living to the northwest of Lake Ste fani, have some resemblance, somatically and culturally, to true Pygmies of the Ituri forest (A. D. Smith, 1897, pp. 272-275). The Okiek, commonly called Dorobo, live solely by hunting. They speak a dialect of Nandi and are hunters for the Masai. The Nandi and the Masai are Half-Hamites, with culture, language, and physique that are basically Hamitic. The Dorobo have features that are more negroid than those of the Masai, and presumably they have not been affected by Hamitic mixture since they are merely a servant class for the pastoral Hamites; yet, according to Huntingford, the Masai do not disdain their Dorobo hunters. In the coastal area of Kenya Colony live hunting tribes named Sanye, Boni, Ariangulu, all of whom are primitive and undeveloped in their culture pattern. The Boni, who call themselves Watwa, hunt for the Somali, and in Abyssinia there is a low caste of hunters whom the Galla call W?tt? (Cerulli, 1922, pp. 200-204). Houses of the Dorobo (Fig. 92) closely resemble those of the Bambuti Pygmies of Ituri, since the dwellings are made by placing the ends of supple sticks in the ground to form a dome which is thatched with banana leaves and other broad foliage. Other cul? tural traits of the Dorobo ^re in harmony with the general pattern of the hunting cultures already examined. The Dorobo have only recently practiced a little agriculture, and they have no domestic animals except dogs. Leather clothing is of a simple kind. Fire is</page><page sequence="343">Hunting Cultures 347 made by twirling. In the practice of placing hives in trees the Dorobo are in advance of the Ituri Pygmies, who merely collect honey from the nests of wild bees. The Dorobo have few crafts, and they do not make objects of iron, though they possess iron arrow points, spears, and swords; these, along with shields are obtained from the Nandi. A chief is elected, and the office is not hereditary; a council of elders is the responsible governing body. Following the system of the Masai and the Nandi, males are divided into boys, warriors, and old men. At the time of circumcision a boy enters the warrior class. These traits show, as we also noted for the Ituri Pygmies, an adoption of customs from neighboring tribes. The Dorobo do not practice burial but leave their dead in the forest to be devoured by hyenas. basic traits of hunting cultures Among the hunting cultures considered, there exist several important differences, though the social and economic patterns are fundamentally similar. Bushmen, Pygmies, and Dorobo are all of negroid stock, but their physical differences are pronounced, and their languages are distinct. The Bushmen have their own peculiar click languages, which differ from all other African tongues. The Pygmies speak current Bantu languages which are employed near to them. The Dorobo speak the Nandi language. These hunters all adopt cultural traits from surrounding tribes; Bushman tribes have adopted some factors of southern Bantu cul? ture. Pygmies have well-established cultural liaisons with central Bantu tribes, and the Dorobo social pattern is modeled on that of the Hamitic Nandi. Common material traits are the use of bows and poisoned arrows along with many ingenious hunting devices. Hunters have few arts, and they are usually dependent on adjacent tribes for blacksmith's work, pottery, baskets, wood-carving, and ornaments. Bushman pictorial art is an exception, for the Bushmen are the only hunters who have specialized in this way. Hunting tribes have no agriculture, and they are dependent on wild vegetable produce dug up and gathered by their women. Dogs which are used when hunting are the only domestic animals. Dwell? ings are of a simple kind, quickly constructed and frequently aban? doned when the tribe has to follow game or find a new water supply. Clothing consists of simple pieces of hide or at the most a fur cloak, as among Bushmen and Dorobo.</page><page sequence="344">348 Source Book for African Anthropology The salient point of the social organization is simplicity, lack of cohesion, and absence of centralization. The functioning groups are those consisting of a few individuals comprised in a family. Families may be united into clans as among the Pygmies, and a loosely co? ordinated tribal unit may exist. Inheritance and succession are problems of minor importance; in fact, they hardly arise. Law and legal procedure depend on well-established precedents. Private feuds are recognized methods of redress, and the judicial system, like the social organization, is of a distinctly decentralized type when compared with the system of Bantu Negroes. Magical practices and religious beliefs are of an elementary kind, showing a lack of centralization in persons and institutions. The Dorobo have the most elaborate social structure of the hunting tribes, but this organization has been adopted from the Nandi, and it cannot be regarded as part of a primitive hunting culture. Possibly the hunting cultures examined here represent a type of life that was characteristic of a large part of the African continent before the intrusion of pastoral Hamites on a large scale, and before the elaboration of the complex social, religious, and legal systems that are now typical of agricultural and semi-pastoral Negro society. The hunting cultures that have been described are typical of a definite mode of life, with local variations. But the fact should be recognized that many Negro tribes with a complex culture, including pastoral pursuits and an agricultural system, still possess a flourishing hunting culture in which ritual observances are even more elaborated than they are among the typical hunters. The historical truth seems to be that many Negro tribes, while acquiring a complex economic pattern, have held tenaciously to their hunting traits, partly on economic grounds, but to a great extent because of the sacred character of the rites associated with the hunter and his craft.</page><page sequence="345">III. PASTORAL PURSUITS The words "pastoral culture" may be used to describe the social patterns of numerous tribes inhabiting the northeast, south, south? east, and southwest regions of Africa. These tribes possess widely divergent somatic and linguistic characteristics, and among them are to be found cultural differences, for example, in the degree of agricultural and industrial development, and in the extent to which social organization is focused in a central authority such as a king or chief. But, despite dissimilarities, a certain homogeneity of culture results from the rearing of cattle and the clustering of many fundamental social, religious, and economic traits about this one occupation. EXAMPLES OF TYPICAL CATTLE CULTURE The geographical focus of the cattle-keeping culture is the region of Lake Victoria Nyanza (Roscoe, 1907, 1911, 1915 et seq.). Here the chief industry of the Banyoro is pastoral, and in the ranks of herdsmen may be found men of the highest rank. But, whatever their social status happens to be, all cattle owners disdain agriculture, handicrafts, building, and hunting as a means of making a living. Cattle are divided into herds according to their colors, each herd being kept apart from other herds which differ in this respect. Little regard is given to producing the breed of cows that gives most milk. If a cow suckles her calves well, and especially if she gives birth to cow calves, she is highly esteemed; whereas a cow that usually bears bull calves is not so highly valued, even though her supply of milk is satisfactory. Herdsmen hold the bull responsible for the sex of the calves, so to remedy the birth of bull calves they change the mating. One bull is thought to be able to serve fifty cows, but in large herds several bulls are kept, and these fight for supremacy. Some bull calves are made impotent by crushing their testicles, and these animals are reared for killing purposes only. Among the Banyankole the king is owner of all cattle, but he has his personal kraal, herds, and herdsmen. The milk supplied to the king is consumed by the men, women, and children of the royal house? hold, but persons of the slave class are nourished on agricultural pro? duce. Vegetable food is considered unclean for strictly pastoral people, and if these persons eat vegetable produce they must observe a fast which is followed by purgatives and emetics. Women churn butter, but milking and herding cattle are exclu? sively the work of men. In the king's kraal is a sacred fire having an 349</page><page sequence="346">350 Source Book for African Anthropology attendant who keeps it burning perpetually, until the time of the king's death. Then the old fire is extinguished, and a new one is created by use of a frictional method. Portions of the new fire are distributed to other kraals and houses. At the fire in the king's kraal the war chief renews his skill and courage by rubbing himself with the ashes. When a king dies, his body is wrapped in the hide of a newly killed cow, after the royal corpse has been washed with milk. Bulls are killed at the graveside of the king, and even the cattle are made to participate in the mourning. Cows are separated from their calves so that both make a melancholy lowing, and the night before a bull is sacrificed at the king's funeral, the animal's scrotum is tied so that it cannot mate with the cows but keeps up a mournful bellowing. Some cows are dedicated to the dead king, and from these milk is taken daily for his shrine. The cattle killed at the grave are said to become the king's herd in a ghost world. Milk is a sacred product which is offered to the royal drums, and to pythons kept as cult animals in a special temple near Mwanza, south of Lake Victoria Nyanza. A taboo against the consumption of milk by menstruating women is a further instance of the sacred character of this dairy product. Medicine-men and rain-makers are important because the former are expected to predict the future of the herd, to foresee calamities, and to provide remedies for sickness. Rain-makers to the king hold a distinguished though not an enviable position, since they are responsible for producing an optimum amount of rainfall. Should the supply of water be insufficient, the king feeds the rain-makers with salt and deprives them of water until their magic is successfully per? formed. On the contrary, if the rainfall is too heavy, the rain-makers are immersed to their necks in water, into which they are repeat? edly pushed until semi-suffocation causes them to check the down? pour of rain. In addition to the economic, magical, and religious aspects of the pastoral culture, life is socially dependent on the possession of herds. A man's social standing is judged by the size of the herds he owns; cattle are used for paying fines, taxes, and debts, and for securing brides. Roscoe points out that the use of cattle as a standard of wealth has led to a form of polyandry in which two brothers, who are unable to afford a wife for each, secure a woman who is a wife for both of them. Polygyny, that is, the possession of more than one wife, is a common African practice, but polyandry is rare. All the</page><page sequence="347">Pastoral Pursuits 351 works of J. Roscoe treat of the importance of cattle as the warp and weft of the culture pattern of Uganda, and for Ruanda, Delmas (1930) produced similar evidence. The Nilotic Negroes, of whom the Dinka, Shilluk, and Nuer are typical, provide an apt illustration of the way in which every aspect of life, economic, social, and religious, centers round the possession of herds. Of the Dinka, H. O'Sullivan (1910) states that all the laws of the Dinka can be grouped in association with four main principles: namely, the possession of women and cattle; securing wives by payment to the kindred of the spouse; inheritance of women, children, and cattle; payment of fines by means of cattle. Many writers attest the basic importance of herds of cattle in the lives of Nilotic Negroes, with the exception of the Anuak (Bacon, 1922) . Among the Nuer, agriculture is almost wholly neglected, despite the fact that grain could easily be grown (H. C. Jackson, 1923) . Frequently the Nuer border on starvation since they, in common with the majority of pastoral tribes, refuse to slaughter their cattle for food. An excellent account of the daily life of the Nuer and their seasonal migrations has been prepared by E. E. Evans Pritchard (1936b). The Shilluk also focus the whole of their religious, social, and economic life on care of cattle. The prosperity of the herds, which depends on rainfall and pasturage, is closely connected with magic, rain-making, and the ceremonial preservation of the vigor of the ruling king (Westermann, 1912; Hofmayr, 1925). J. H. Driberg (1922, 1923) shows that among the Lango of Uganda, also among the Didinga, care of cattle and preservation of the office of official rain-maker are intimately related by much ritual, prayer, and sacrifice. A brief description of the Didinga tribe has also been given by Molinaro (1935). A comprehensive account of the whole of the Nilotic cattle culture has been prepared by C. G. and B. Z. Seligman (1932). F. R. R. Somerset (Lord Raglan, 1918) has described the Lotuko, and Titherington the Raik Dinka (1927). The Bahr-el-Ghazal Dinka have been the subject of an article by Cummins (1904), and more recently Crazzolara (1934) and Cze kanowski (1927) have contributed to the study of Nilotic Negro pastoral patterns. Consult also L. F. Nalder (1936), and the periodical Sudan Notes and Records. A Half-Hamitic tribe named the Suk, living northeast of Lake Victoria Nyanza, are divided into pastoral and agricultural sections (Beech, 1911). The former division is composed of the aristocracy,</page><page sequence="348">352 Source Book for African Anthropology while the other division is responsible for manufactures and tilling the soil. The pastoral Suk have individual names for their cattle, and a long vocabulary of adjectives for describing the colors in detail. Beech says, "The Suk live for their cattle and everything is done to make them objects of reverence." Examples of the ceremonial which is associated with cattle are numerous. Animals whose horns have been twisted as an embellishment are decorated with ostrich feathers and driven to the river, while warriors dance around them to give good luck in a raiding expedition. Once a month the animals are driven to a salt lick at the first appearance of a new moon. The herd is not allowed to proceed if no moon is visible, for there is a belief that this would produce sickness in the herd. Cattle are marked according to the clan to which they belong, but marks of personal ownership are unnecessary since each owner knows his animals so well that no confusion can arise. The Suk, like the Masai, follow the practice of drawing blood from the veins of bulls, for which purpose a special arrow is used and a ligature is tied; the blood is drunk with milk. The corpse of a commoner who owns no cattle is thrown in the bush, but the body of a cattle owner is buried in his kraal with three feet of cattle dung above him, and the site is abandoned. Grass is a sign of peace, and a man who wears a tuft of grass on his head will be spared by a victorious enemy. If raiders enter a kraal and women are able to pour milk on them, no killing takes place. If cattle are stolen and recovered, their blood plays an important part in the trial of the accused. Blood drawn from the cattle is thrown at the cattle, the accuser, and the accused, in the belief that a man who has spoken falsely will die. This is a form of trial by ordeal. Cattle are used as fines and compensation, and a murderer is expected to pay fifty cows as blood-money to the relatives of his victim. Ownership of cattle and the use of land for grazing are linked factors. Grazing land belongs to the whole tribe and no family or clan can claim the right to own or use a particular portion. But in practice, as a result of long-established custom, each family is restricted to the use of a definite area. The Masai of Kenya (Hollis, 1905; Merker, 1910; Leakey, 1930) esteem their cattle above all other possessions; they despise agri? culture, hunting, and manual labor. Masai lion hunters have great prestige, but the Masai will not hunt as a means of providing food; this work is given to the Dorobo, who are a serf class. Among the Masai, grass, milk, and the blood of cattle have important symbolic</page><page sequence="349">la ^?PPIIHfl^Hi - P 1 S I ^^^^ X V " ?2 J^LflHil^^^^^' rilm^S3 bio ^fls*^ m&amp; ^ ^^^^^ 353</page><page sequence="350">354 Source Book for African Anthropology uses. Drinking of blood and milk is a form of covenant, a blood brotherhood. In legal procedure the accused drinks blood of an ox, saying, "If I have done this deed, may God kill me." When a boy is about to be beaten by a warrior he tries to pluck a tuft of grass, for this act will give him immunity. During drought, women fasten grass on their clothes and pray to the Black God who sends rain. The importance of religious belief and magical practice in relation to pastoral life among the Masai has been discussed by H. Fokken (1917) ;Huntingford (1933a) and Hollis (1909) have described customs of the pastoral Nandi. The value of cattle in the social and economic life of these tribes is shown in many ways. Presentation of cattle to a prospective father-in-law is a necessary part of a marriage contract. Cattle are used in payment of fines and as compensation for injuries inflicted. Testamentary bequests are in the form of herds, for there is little property of any other kind. At the death of an old person, a medi? cine-man, or a rich owner of cattle, an ox is slaughtered. Fat from the sacrificed animal is rubbed on the corpse, which is then wrapped in oxhide, and at a funeral feast the sacrificial meat is eaten. The typical pastoral culture is not confined to Hamites, such as the Bahima, to Half-Hamites (Suk, Masai, and Nandi), or to the Nilotic Negroes. The same type of cultural pattern, modified by the incorporation of an agricultural system maintained by the labor of women, is characteristic of many tribes of Bantu-speaking Negroes. modified pastoral cultures The Ba-ila of Northern Rhodesia value their cattle above all other possessions, and they are indignant with the idea of using cattle for transport or harnessing them to a plow. The Ba-ila think that cattle have melodious voices, and the natural beauty of the animals is enhanced by decorating them with necklaces, ruffles, and bells. A ceremonial element enters into milking processes, for the herding and the actual operation of milking are accompanied by drum music. Migration to a new pasture is an occasion for the ceremonial slaughter of an ox, and when cattle are killed at a funeral feast the hides are used to line the grave (E. W. Smith and A. M. Dale, 1920). The Bavenda (Stayt, 1931a) of the Transvaal are cattle keepers who use the animals for paying tribute, fines, and debts, for ritual meals, and as an offering to a deity. Cattle form the lobola, which must be paid to a bride's kin in order to legalize a marriage and to secure possession of the woman and her children by the husband. Among all the southeastern Bantu tribes, cattle have been important</page><page sequence="351"></page><page sequence="352">356 Source Book for African Anthropology in warfare, social life, law, and religion. I. Schapera has described the magic and medicines associated with cattle in Bechuanaland (Schapera, 1930b, 1934a). In South West Africa the Herero are a typical Bantu Negro tribe with pastoral pursuits as the most salient feature of their culture. H. Vedder believes that the Herero had contacts with pastoral Hamites early in the cultural history of these east African invaders. Vedder states that Herero traditions indicate their migration from east Africa to southern Angola, then across the River Kunene to their present location (Vedder, 1923). The chief work of men centers in herding cattle, but women and girls are allowed to milk the animals. A prohibition against the washing of milk vessels exists, and the utensils must be used and remain unclean until they fall to pieces. Meat is too valuable to be used as food, but milk is a staple diet. Agriculture and handi? crafts are considered menial. In religious exercises (Brauer, 1925) cattle play an important role. Cattle are sacrificed to ancestors, but no part of the meat is eaten until some has been offered to ancestral staffs which are care? fully preserved. The holy fire is situated between the calf kraal and the house of the chief's principal wife. The sacred fireplace is an altar around which the horns of sacrificed animals are piled. Extinc? tion of the fire would mean annihilation of the tribe, since the fire was a gift from the god Mukuru. A man who is setting out on a journey secures a blessing from his ancestors by carrying a brand from the sacred fire. The embers he carries form the nucleus of a new fire at his destination. The Ovambo, including the Vakwanyama of south Angola, have a pastoral culture which is similar to that of the Herero (C. H. L. Hahn, 1928; Irle, 1906, 1917). The Benguela Highlands of central Angola, which are occupied by the Ovimbundu, mark the southwestern limit of expansion of the Hamitic cattle culture. Primarily the Ovimbundu are agricultural? ists, but they have added certain factors of the pastoral system to their typical Bantu Negro culture. The head of a dead chief is severed and wrapped in oxhide, which is ceremonially renewed. Mourners of the chief's family wear bracelets of oxhide. Cattle are killed at the funeral feast and the horns are mounted over the grave (Hambly, 1934a). The foregoing summary gives the main outlines of the typical pastoral culture, which has been described in detail by M. J. Her skovits (1926). But, in addition to this culture pattern, there exist</page><page sequence="353">6 Fig. 68. a. Transport by cattle, Maradi, French Niger Territory. 6. Portu? guese riding an ox, Elende, Angola. 357</page><page sequence="354">358 Source Book for African Anthropology several tribes whose most valuable possession is cattle, yet the animals are not the focus of the social and religious life. The Bag gara (Yunis, 1922; Lampen, 1933), the Kababish (C. G. and B. Z. Seligman, 1918) and other tribes of Kordofan and Daf?r value their cattle, but the animals are used for transport (Fig. 68, a). The herds do not play an important part in ceremonial life. Study of life in Abyssinia affords many examples of the herding of cattle, which have great economic and social value. But the religious aspect of the true pastoral culture is in abeyance, perhaps because of the wide establishment of Mohammedanism, which has usurped the place of earlier Hamitic and Semitic veneration for cattle. There is no specific work on social attitudes toward cattle in Abyssinia, but data will be found in the following publications: Parkyns (1853), Cecchi (1885-86), Casati (1891), Paulitschke (1888, 1893), and Ferrand (1903). Modern contributions to the life of the Galla and other Abyssinian tribes are given by Werner (1914), Bieber (1920), Puccioni (1931), Cerulli (1933), and Jensen (1936). The Hottentots use oxen for riding and transport, and females are allowed to milk the cows. In these usages the Hottentots differ from truly pastoral tribes, yet a certain amount of ceremonial is recognized. Menstruating women must abstain from milking and afterwards be ceremonially reintroduced to the work. Girls who are passing through puberty rites are conducted round the kraal so that they may touch the male animals and so confer potency on them. Any breach with the traditions of the past, any toleration of slackness in carrying out the restrictions demanded for all contingencies in the life of the people, is bound to affect the stock adversely (Schapera, 1930a, p. 298; Hoernte, 1918, 1925; Lebzelter, 1933). Some of the nomadic, cattle-keeping Fulani of west Africa have an attitude toward cattle which is concerned with both economic and ceremonial requirements. On the one hand, bulls and oxen are trained to carry loads, but the Shuwalbe Fulani believe that cattle had a magical origin, for they are regarded as a gift from a water spirit. The owners are familiar with their cattle and are able to call each by name. The flesh of cattle is seldom eaten, and then only on ceremonial occasions such as naming a child, celebrating a wedding, or observing a Mohammedan festival. Women milk the cows and churn butter. Cattle are inherited in the male line from fathers to sons, and sharing of the cattle according to their colors is a feature of the system of inheritance. The oldest son takes all the black cattle, while the younger sons share the white animals. In time of drought</page><page sequence="355">Pastoral Pursuits 359 a herdsman strips himself, then stands among the cattle and anoints their horns with milk. If disease threatens the herds, a Moham? medan mallam, who is a teacher and maker of charms, walks seven times round the kraal, repeating texts from the Koran. The traits described indicate a blending of factors of the true Hamitic pastoral culture with those of Mohammedanism (Brackenbury, 1923; L. N. Reed, 1932; Wilson-Haff enden, 1927, 1930; and Von Pfeffer 1936). summary In analyzing the social patterns that have developed in associa? tion with pastoral cultures, the following traits are found to be of primary importance, though they are not all present in every pastoral culture; neither do particular traits receive equal emphasis in each of the cultures in which they occur. The attitude of herdsmen toward their cattle is one of extreme solicitude; the care and affection lavished on the herds is one of the most impressive aspects of the culture. Religious and magical con? cepts associate cattle with life beyond the grave, with burial rites, and with the sacrificial use of meat, milk, and blood. Prayers and ritual for making rain are important, while the use of sacred fire is one of the most constant traits of the culture. References to this trait are numerous from Uganda to the extreme south, and southwest to the Ovimbundu. Eiselen (1929) has dealt fully with ritual connected with the sacred fire of the Bapedi of the Transvaal. At the head of a social system which is founded on pastoral pur? suits, the office of king or chief has sacred functions, and official rain-makers are the principal priests. Social status depends on the ownership of cattle; the larger the herds, the higher the rank of the possessor. Fulfillment of marriage contracts is dependent on owner? ship of stock. Inheritance and succession are usually in the male line from father to son or to a brother of the deceased. Blood brotherhood, which forms the most enduring of social ties, is effected by drinking a mixture of blood and milk from cattle. Typical Hamitic herdsmen, as among the Bahima and Masai, form a social aristocracy and a military caste, which is concerned with raiding for cattle and securing new land for grazing purposes. In some Hamitic social systems, namely, those of the Galla, Masai, and Nandi, age grades are fundamental for both males and females. According to a complex system, males pass from boyhood through the warrior class to the governing grade of old men. In the legal system, cattle are important as tribute, for payment of taxes, and as compensations.</page><page sequence="356">360 Source Book for African Anthropology In economic life, procedure varies among different pastoral tribes, but Nilotic Negroes, Hamites, and Half-Hamites who possess the typical cattle culture disdain agriculture and handicrafts, which are either neglected or relegated to a serving class. Meat is not eaten as an item of the ordinary diet, but it is consumed as a rite which is associated with some event of social and religious importance. Milk is a staple food. Some pastoral tribes make butter, and certain tribes drink the blood of cattle mixed with milk. A division of labor on a sex basis is evident in the true pastoral culture. Men are the usual herders and milkers, but local customs vary in this respect. Among some Bantu Negroes, for example, the Ba-ila, the Ovimbundu, and the southeastern Bantu, keeping cattle is combined with a well-developed system of agriculture which is in charge of women. Despite differences in social patterns among cattle keepers who inhabit the large areas of east and south Africa, the primary traits are well enough preserved to justify the general? izations we have made with regard to a typical pastoral culture.</page><page sequence="357">IV. CAMEL KEEPERS OF THE SAHARA The Tuareg In order to illustrate the basic importance of the breeding of camels and the use of these animals in caravan trade, three areas of the Sahara are selected for study. These regions are the mountains of Air in the south-central Sahara, the plateau of Tibesti in the east central Sahara, and the oases of the eastern Libyan Desert. The tribes inhabiting these regions differ in physique, in language, and to some extent in culture, but all are primarily dependent on the ownership of camels and on agriculture within very restricted fertile tracts. The chief spiritual factor is Mohammedanism. Enormous tracts of the Sahara are uninhabited, and the absence of regular water supplies over most of the area has caused human life to be concentrated either in high plateau regions or in oases, for in these areas permanent supplies of water can be obtained from wells. Between these habitable regions are two types of desert, the stony and sandy (Figs. 4, 5), which are so arid that communication can be maintained only by means of camel transport. This has been of primary importance in warfare and trade. The oases suffer from an incessant onslaught of sand that fills gardens, streets, and wells, so that in sedentary life as well as in trekking, the fight against des? ert conditions is continuous. Details of temperature and rainfall together with ecological information are given by Fitzgerald (1934, pp. 56-57, 59-60). Chevalier (1932) should be consulted for informa? tion relating to plant geography. The oasis of Kowar, with Bilma as its chief town, lies between the mountains of Air and the plateau of Tibesti. Of the desert region near Bilma, A. Buchanan says, "The Bilma Desert is desert at its worst, an absolute sea of sand destitute of the minutest object. Nothing relieves the eye, not even a morsel of vegetation, and there is no living creature whatever." Caravan routes follow the dried courses of ancient rivers that used to form a network of channels over the Sahara (Bourbon, 1933). The speed with which these depressions (wadis) can be converted into river beds is related by Buchanan (1926, p. 204): "The first warning of impending events came from a huge ominous cloud, lurid lightning, and a roar of thunder. The whole aspect of the country changed, while streams began to form and gurgle all round us; these grew at an alarming pace. A low murmuring arose in the hills behind 361</page><page sequence="358">362 Source Book for African Anthropology and drew nearer until we witnessed the remarkable sight of a foam crested billow advancing down the hitherto empty river bed; so the stream was breast high." The water from such cloudbursts is wasted, with the exception of that which sinks through the sand and finds impervious strata. In such places wells are formed, and on these the long-distance caravans are dependent. In the mountains of Air (Asben), rains begin in early July and continue throughout August, by which time the customary routes have been converted into channels of water that render them im? passable. After the rains the valleys and hillsides are clothed with verdure, including many grasses, palms, and acacias. The thorny acacias are particularly useful as food for camels. Among these mountains, which rise to a height of 6,000 feet, live the Tuareg of Air, surrounded by both stony desert and dunes, whose crossing is attempted only under the leadership of a few renowned guides. Fig. 69 shows a typical Tuareg camel caravan, and Fig. 70 gives a group of Tuareg horsemen. The journeys of Buchanan (1922,1926), which were taken chiefly in the interests of zoology, demonstrated a distribution of animal life greater than had been anticipated. On the sparsely covered plains of Damergu between Lake Chad and Air, bustards and ostriches were found, while giraffe were occasionally seen. Antelopes included the white oryx, from whose hides the Tuareg make their large triangular shields, also the addax, which ranges as far north as 22?, a point well within the desert area. In Air warthogs are rare, but they are seen at intervals, as also are jackals, wildcats, hyenas, foxes, ground squirrels, jerboas, porcupines, and hares. Lions are rare in Air, but F. R. Rodd gives an account of the killing of one in recent times. Buchanan reports that his collection of birds from the Sahara included 134 different species and subspecies, many of which were migrants from southern Europe. In Air, and in the Hoggar Mountains north of Air, Barbary sheep live at high altitudes. In this habitat lives a section of the Tuareg, a word that is used by Arabs to designate many tribes who call themselves Kel Tagilmus, People of the Veil, in reference to the fact that all adult males cover their faces so that only their eyes and the upper parts of their fore? heads are seen (Palmer, 1928, vol. 3, p. 62; this work, Fig. 70). The veil is not removed under any circumstances; even during meals it is lifted when food is placed in the mouth. The origin of this custom of wearing the litham has not been explained. The veil is one of the insignia of manhood assumed by a boy who is ceremonially</page><page sequence="359">m^^^^ Ku^Jli^^Lv fl^^^^f .^U^^h ^B^^m *JLflfl^^^l^^^^95 Fig. 69. Tuareg Caravan, near Zinder, French Niger Territory. 363</page><page sequence="360">364 Source Book for African Anthropology passed into the adult stage. The Tuareg are divided geographically into five main groups having some ethnological and linguistic dif? ferences. The Hoggar, Adzjer, and Iforas are the Tuareg of the north. The Tuareg of Air and the Niger are Tuareg of the south. The tribes of Air who have been selected for consideration here are physically, linguistically, and culturally similar to those of Hoggar. Among the best works dealing with the Tuareg are Palmer (1932, 1934,1936b), Rodd (1926,1936), Abadie (1927), Duveyrier (1864a,b), Aymard (1911), Benhazera (1908), De Zeltner (1914 a, b), Chudeau (1909), L. Hall (1927), D'Armagnac (1934), and Schirmer (1893). D'Armagnac (1934) has discussed the subject of racial and cultural diffusion in the Sahara. In T. Monod's (1933-35) bibliography of the Sahara will be found a survey of the chief literature dealing with this region. The facts detailed under physical anthropology showed the Tuareg to be northern Hamites of aquiline features, with gray-blue or perhaps dark eyes, and curly hair unlike the woolly hair of Negroes. They are tall and slender, with dignified and graceful carriage. The skin color is often olive brown and many Tuareg, if suitably dressed, would not be incongruous among Europeans of the Mediterranean race. Physique, social organization, and economic conditions have been affected by acquisition of Negro slaves from the western Sudan. material culture The main items of clothing for men are flowing robes and wide trousers, with perhaps a tanned goatskin or sheepskin worn round the loins below the trousers. Both blue and white colors are used by men; the former are the more common. Sandals of leather or palm fronds are worn. Charms include small leather satchels containing Koranic texts; these are fastened to the arms or are suspended round the neck. Steatite (soapstone) armlets of green color are worn above the elbow as an indication of rank. Some of these ornaments show neat repair work with small metal rivets. The rings are rubbed down from a round matrix, polished with sand, and baked in fat. A popular neck ornament is made from agate; this is of triangular shape, with a ring at the top formed from the one matrix. In the market at Kano tawdry imitations in glass are sold. The distinctive equipment of a man is, in addition to the veil, a broad, straight, cross-hilted sword, a barbed throwing-spear, an oryx-hide shield, and a number of arm rings of stone. The usual dress for a woman is a skirt of indigo cloth with perhaps a narrow white stripe in it, and a sleeveless coat. Silver bangles and</page><page sequence="361"></page><page sequence="362">366 Source Book for African Anthropology hair ornaments of the same metal are the customary decorations. Despite the injunctions of Mohammedanism, Tuareg women do not veil, but they draw their hoods across their faces in the presence of strangers. The henna plant, which grows in Air, is used for making a red dye for staining finger and toe nails. Kohl is employed for darkening the eyelashes. In some regions of Air stone-built houses are used, but dwellings are usually more temporary. A hut is quickly made by tying to? gether the tops of palm frond ribs that have been stuck in the ground. On this framework is laid a thatch of coarse grass, while mats provide the walls. In the city of Agades in southern Air many of the houses have vertical mud walls, and flat roofs which are drained by clay pipes. This is a type of architecture commonly found in Egypt, north Africa, and the western Sudan. The roof is reached by a flight of stairs built in the outer wall. In the interior are chambers and courtyards, some of which are reserved for females (Figs. 73, 74, a). The most primitive house is one used by nomadic Tuareg, who make a portable structure by stretching ox-skins on poles. A bed, which accommodates the whole family, is made by placing poles on Y-shaped supports and covering the poles with mats. The family sleep on the ground in the dry season. The Tuareg some? times use tents of Bedouin type made of camel- or goat-hair rugs (Fig. 72). A Tuareg proverb states that "shame enters a family that tills the soil/' nevertheless, agricultural produce is more important than meat in Tuareg diet, and grain is almost as staple as the milk of camels and goats. Negro slaves perform agricultural work, and even in sedentary communities Tuareg women do not till the soil. If force of circumstances makes agricultural interests inevitable, there is always the hope that such employment will be temporary, and that camels will ultimately be obtained. In this social distinc? tion between pastoral and agricultural pursuits among the Tuareg, there is a parallel with the lives of the eastern Hamites whose social standing depends on ownership of cattle. The principal grains used by the Tuareg are millet and wheat, which are both grown in Air, though a considerable quantity of millet is imported from the Sudan. Crushing in stone querns is the first stage in preparing wheat for cooking, but millet, a softer grain than wheat, is pounded in a wooden mortar. The Tuareg frequently travel where wood for fires is unobtainable; therefore, millet is baked into cakes that are carried on the journey, and for a short excursion</page><page sequence="363">Camel Keepers of the Sahara 367 of two days a man provides no more than a mush of millet in water, which is conveyed in goatskin bags. If firewood is obtainable, ignition is accomplished by rubbing a piece of hard wood in a groove of softer wood. The Tuareg are indifferent potters who attempt no more than the manufacture of coarse red ware, but cooking pots of better quality are imported from Agades. The Tuareg employ a method of cooking which is widely adopted by Arabs and Berbers. A perforated pot is placed over the mouth of a lower pot containing water, which is boiled. The rising steam cooks the wheat or other grain in the upper pot, which contains, in addition to grain, some meat and salt, with seasoning. Meat is a luxury, since the milk of sheep, goats, camels, and cows is required for making cheese, and the animals are too valuable for slaughter. Meat is sometimes cooked under the hot embers of a fire, and, for use when trekking, meat is preserved by soaking it in brine and drying it in the sun. The Tuareg will eat the flesh of an animal that has died from injury, provided the creature's throat has been cut before it died. Flesh of camels is eaten if this rite has been performed. The custom of cutting the throat of an animal so that the flesh may be ritually clean is of ancient Semitic origin, and the usage has become a part of Mohammedan and Jewish procedure. Date palms which have been introduced into Air from regions farther north supply an important article of diet. Sometimes the dates are eaten while fresh, but more often they are soaked in water, then pressed into leather receptacles that are tightly sewn. During a journey, the main foods are powdered cheese, dates, cakes of cooked millet, and water; but some nomads can dispense with water for weeks, provided their camels and goats are giving an adequate supply of milk. Churning to make cheese and butter is an occupation for women, who use skin bags as churns. Women also grind grain and do the cooking. Young boys are trained in work of this kind, and to them such tasks are given during journeys. Men make saddles and other equipment, twist rope from palm fiber, and sew water-skins from goat-hide. Certain trades, for example, that of the blacksmith, are in the hands of specialists, and, no matter what the social standing of a blacksmith may be, he commands respect because of his occupation. With his iron-forging a blacksmith often combines the work of jeweler and carpenter. The former occupation is concerned with the manufacture of silver ornaments for women, while the latter</page><page sequence="364">368 Source Book for African Anthropology produces wooden spoons, ladles, bowls, and other domestic utensils. Men of the Tuareg are more skilled than women in making clothes, and this is also true among the Hausa of Kano, where men make the clothing for themselves and for their women. Men make hide shields, swords, arm-daggers, and spears. Shields and spears are falling into desuetude since the entry of modern rifles. Knives and swords are imported from Kano in northern Nigeria. A. Dupuis-Yacouba (1914, 1921), De Gironcourt (1914), and De Zeltner (1914b) all give well-illustrated accounts of Tuareg art and industries. Dupuis Yacouba deals specifically with the art of Timbuktu. Personal ornaments have been described in detail by Arkell (1935a, b). Animal life is not so plentiful as to encourage specialization in hunting. The distribution of a round, cane foot-trap used for catch? ing gazelle has been described by Lindblom (1928a). Horses are not generally seen except near Agades, and the chief beasts of burden, apart from camels, are pack-oxen and small donkeys, which are used for local transport. Cattle of the humped species are purchased from the Fulani, who are nomadic herdsmen of the western Sudan. The Hausa have introduced cats. Dogs are plentiful. Chickens are used as food. These domestic animals are less important than camels, whose ownership is a basic trait in the economic and social organization. Of the genus Camel dromedarius, which is the Arabian camel with one hump, many species are to be seen in Air. One conspicuous breed is a tall, sandy-colored camel having great height at the shoulder; these animals are bred in the plateau region of Tibesti, several hun? dred miles to the east of Air. The Ghati camel is reddish-fawn in color, and because of its massive build it can carry heavy loads. The rough-coated camels that are bred in the Hoggar Mountains are of great height and strength. The large white camels are reared in Air. The Tuareg are able to deduce an astonishing amount of information from camel tracks which give a certain clue to the breed, and every camel owner knows the spoor of each of his animals. Camel bactrianus, the shaggy, two-humped Asiatic camel, is not used in Africa. The resistance of camels to drought depends on the conditions under which they were reared. If accustomed to only small rations of water, the animals will be allowed to drink every third day, and they will go for much longer periods without serious suffering. Yet camels are delicate animals, requiring time for browsing slowly, and they are subject to several diseases. The feet are liable to develop</page><page sequence="365">Camel Keepers of the Sahara 369 cracks, and saddle sores are readily formed. Baggage camels cannot travel more than three miles an hour without risk of injury. The care of camels, their breeding, the making of equipment, technique of loading, conduction of caravans, and organization of raiding have formed the core of Tuareg life. Changing economic conditions result? ing from European intrusion are militating against the caravan trade, while supervision by French camel corps patrols places a check on desert warfare. Leonard (1894) has written a standard work on 'The Camel and Its Management" and useful notes are to be found in the works of MacMichael (1913), Hassanein Bey (1924), and King (1925). The object of the annual caravan journey from Air to Bilma, a distance of about three hundred miles, is to secure salt, which is traded everywhere in the western Sudan. The route is almost water? less, and since there is no fodder or browsing for the camels, bales of provender have to be carried. The food for the return journey is cached on the outward trip. At present the caravan numbers about five thousand camels, but in time past as many as thirty thousand animals have made the journey. A Tuareg who owns only one camel is anxious to join the caravan, while a wealthy man may have a hundred animals or more. The ambition of all Tuareg of Air is to join in this great enterprise, which is also accompanied by Hausa traders from Kano and Sokoto. For weeks in advance the caravan is assembling in Air, until at last the train of camels, perhaps seven miles long, sets out for Bilma. The daily journey is about forty miles, made at the rate of two and a half miles an hour. A record journey for riding camels was made in the year 1917, when Tuareg scouts who were faithful to the French carried news of an attack on Agades. The journey of two hundred and fifty miles from Agades to Zinder was accomplished in four days. religion and social structure In religion the Tuareg are Mohammedan, but they are lax and superficial toward their faith. Charles de Foucauld (Bazin, 1923) has said, "Although the Tuareg are Musulmans by faith they are very igno? rant of Islam and have not been spoiled by it." In this respect the Tuareg differ essentially from the Senussi Arabs of the Libyan oases, and the Teda of Tibesti. These Mohammedans have been evangelized by the fanatical Senussi Mohammedans, who observe the tenets of the faith strictly and have no tolerance of unbelievers. The Tuareg have a code of morality which to some extent is derived from Islamic teaching. Water is not denied to any enemy in the</page><page sequence="366">370 Source Book for African Anthropology desert, wells are not poisoned, and palms are not cut down. The Tuareg do not break their bond of peace; they keep their word to those who are permitted to travel through their country, and in warfare certain standards of conduct are observed. On the whole the life of the Tuareg conforms to the standard of austerity enjoined by the Prophet. The Tuareg do not smoke tobacco, but they chew green tobacco mixed with saltpeter. They are not addicted to alcoholic drinks. Mohammedan sects are divided respecting the permissibility of alcoholic drinks. The Senussi sect forbids coffee but sanctions the use of tea. Injunctions against tobacco are, of course, post-Koranic. The ceremonial life is not well developed, and rites are of a simple kind. No birth ceremonies are observed, but boys are circumcised in compliance with Mohammedan custom. Marriage ceremonies are performed in Mohammedan fashion, and at death a corpse is buried supine with the face turned toward Mecca. Music and danc? ing as adjuncts of ceremonies are of a primitive type. An improvised drum is made by floating a calabash in water, or by stretching a skin over a wooden mortar of the kind in which grain is pounded. An? other kind of drum is made by stretching a piece of scraped hide over the top of a pottery vessel. There is not much dancing, but solo sword dances are sometimes performed by men. Political organization comprises a hierarchy of tribal chiefs, village headmen, and headmen of sections within villages. The names of primary tribes begin with the letter "I," and subdivisions are denoted by words having "Kel" as a prefix. The prefix has a geographical significance meaning "the people of." For example, the word "Ikazkazan" denotes one of the main aristocratic divisions, and the names Kel Ulli and Kel Seliufet denote local subdivisions. The elective principle operates in tribal government, and the annual meeting for the caravan journey to Bilma is the occasion for electing rulers. In this way economic and legislative requirements are made to harmonize. Tuareg government is of the patriarchal Bedouin Arab type, in which a tribal leader is paramount in peace and war; his functions are military, legislative, and judicial. Heads of families unite to form councils, and in each extended family there are several patriarchal chiefs, each having authority over a house? hold. This is a Semitic, but not the oldest type of Semitic organiza? tion. Among the Tuareg, claims of personal ascendancy are strong, and individual initiative is often concerned in making or breaking alliances between tribes. Some political liaisons are formed only to</page><page sequence="367">Camel Keepers of the Sahara 371 give strength in war but others are of a more permanent character; yet all are disturbed and curtailed by the superimposed European system of administration. In contrast with the patriarchal system are customs that are distinctly favorable to the prestige of women. Tuareg women are strong-minded, gifted, and intelligent; they have dignity and mod? esty. Contrary to Mohammedan practice, women may own property; they take part in tribal councils, and, among the Kel Geres, they rule several villages. Polygyny is permissible, but monogamy is the more general practice. Among tribes who still preserve T'ifinagh, the script in which Tamashek, the language of the Tuareg, is written, women teach their children to write. Girls show great independence in making their own betrothals, and it is not unusual for a girl to take an all-night ride on a camel to see her lover. The traveler, Ibn Batuta (a.d. 1325-54), was shocked at what he considered to be the immodesty of Tuareg women, for on entering a house he came into the presence of a young and beautiful woman, who, regardless of the absence of her veil, "laughed at his embarrassment instead of blushing with shame." A Tuareg idea of the status of women is expressed in the saying, "Men and women are for the eyes and the heart, and not only for the bed." Divorce proceedings follow the Koranic precepts, but adultery is uncommon and prostitution is discountenanced in Air. In Agades, where Tuareg mingle with Hausa, Kanuri, and other tribes, irregular sexual relations are more usual than in a purely Tuareg community. At Bilma a guild of women is a band of professional prostitutes, but Bilma is a place of Tuareg caravan trade and not a place of Tuareg settlement. Infanticide does not exist, but the death rate among children is high; there are no midwives and no medicine-men. Female friends assist delivery by massage, and death in childbed is said to be rare. Children are well disciplined and industrious. The Tuareg say that because of the period of pregnancy, children belong to their mother by prior right, and the father's claim to his offspring is secondary. If a woman marries outside her tribe, the children belong to her kindred and not to the kindred of her husband. Moreover, if a man has married a woman from a tribe other than his own, and his wife survives him, she returns to her own tribe, taking her children with her. Motherless children are returned to the kindred of their deceased mother, and, if a woman is divorced, she returns to her own tribe, taking her children with her. If war breaks out between two tribes, some of whose members have intermarried,</page><page sequence="368">372 Source Book for African Anthropology the women and their children return to their own tribes until hostili? ties are ended. The position of a slave woman, who is usually of Negro extraction, is different. She and her children are permanently part of the tribe into which they enter, by sale or by marriage. Descent is reckoned through females, and if an aristocratic Imajegan has taken a wife from the slave class, or from a tribe inferior to his own, he will have difficulty in securing recognition of his children as part of the Imajegan. The offspring are usually classed as Irejanaten, that is, the "mixed people." Recognition of descent through females affects inheritance and succession. Ibn Batuta pointed out that the heir of the Sultan of Tekadda was the son of the ruler's sister, and the same law of suc? cession prevailed at Ghat. F. R. Rodd says (1926, p. 152), "It seems clear that before the advent of Islam, which has tended to modify the system, the Tuareg had a completely matriarchal organi? zation." The Tuareg resemble the Kababish in this combination of an old Semitic matriarchal system with a more modern Semitic and Mohammedan patriarchal regime. The Tuareg present a picture of nomadic life of the desert based on the rearing of camels and the organization of long-distance cara? vans. A complementary organization is seen in the lives of sedentary agriculturalists, but these constitute the lower social class. Arts and industries are only moderately well developed. Social organization combines distinct features of systems based on male and female primogeniture respectively, and the two systems are made to harmo? nize. The religion is a moderate form of Mohammedanism. According to F. R. Rodd, the Tuareg have fought with a losing hand. They have been driven from the north by Arabs and harried by everyone. At last, European force of arms has prevailed, and in wars with the French many Tuareg have perished, while others have been punished and reduced to poverty. Yet the pride of the Tuareg endures, and they console themselves with the adage, "It is wise to kiss the hand you cannot cut off." The Tibesti Plateau The Tebu (Tibbu) and the Teda are the principal tribes inhabiting the plateau of Tibesti; these tribes are hereditary enemies of the Tuareg. Their physique is Hamitic with a Negro mixture. The languages are ancient Berber (Hamitic) with some Sudanic Negro elements added, but no satisfactory record has yet been made, and the plateau is imperfectly known ethnologically and in other respects.</page><page sequence="369">Camel Keepers of the Sahara 373 Buchanan (1926) gives excellent photographs of the Tibbu. R?quin (1935) has described the clans of the Teda, and Noel (1920) has given some ethnological notes on this tribe. MacMichael (1912b) has sup? plied information on the Zaghawa, who are related to the Teda and Tibbu. The Tibbu are camel breeders and caravan men whose journeys take them east to the Libyan oases of Kufra and Ouehat, and south? west to Lake Chad. Part of the population is sedentary, and between this section and the nomadic element there exists a complementary economic life, as among the Tuareg of Air. In Tibesti the usual dress of north African Mohammedans has been adopted. Men wear a turban wound several times round the head, passed under the chin, and sometimes made to cover the lower part of the face. The main articles of clothing are a loose, wide sleeved smock, wide trousers, and sandals, with perhaps the addition of a sheepskin mantle. The plateau rises in places to a height of ten thousand feet, and this elevation, combined with a desert environ? ment, causes extremes of temperature between night and day. Amulets and charms are of the usual Mohammedan type, consisting mainly of leather satchels containing written excerpts from the Koran. These are worn on the upper arms or around the neck. The weapons are a barbed javelin, an arm-dagger, and a throwing knife. Women wear loose robes of blue cloth made fast at the left shoul? ders, and, like the men, they are well armed, since family blood-feuds of Tibesti are bitter and enduring. Men shave their heads, but women part their hair in the middle and allow it to hang low on each side of the head. Each plait ends in a ball of hard wax. Women perforate their ear-lobes and the sides of their noses to receive silver studs. Scarification is not extensively practiced, but between the ages of five and twelve months the shoulders, bellies, and breasts of females are ornamented with cuts. Scarification is a Negro custom, but the common Negro practice of mutilating the teeth is not fol? lowed in Tibesti. Finger nails of women are stained with henna, and kohl is applied to darken the eyelids and eyelashes. Both boys and girls have their heads shaved, and young girls go naked except for a waist-band and a small leather apron ornamented with cowrie shells. The dwellings ordinarily used are movable structures made of mats, but Denham and his companions reported the existence of rock shelters which were reached by ladders. These retreats proved useful during raids made by bands of Tuareg.</page><page sequence="370">374 Source Book for African Anthropology The Teda and the Tibbu are strict Mohammedans, with a deep mistrust of foreigners. Burial is of the Mohammedan type with the face of the corpse turned toward Mecca, and a marabout (Moham? medan saint) is engaged to recite from the Koran during the obsequies. Circumcision is practiced on boys between the ages of eight and fourteen years, and girls suffer the operation of clitoridectomy during infancy. Marriage ceremonies are intricate; the formalities include presentations from the groom to his parents-in-law, and arrange? ments are made for the bride to receive a dowry of camels from her father. Marriage rites begin with a fight, in which the bride's relatives attempt to prevent the groom from taking the bride from her kindred. P. Noel (1920) states that the fight is a real one, in which the bride's home is wrecked. The bride spends the first night of married life in the home prepared by her husband, but her spouse is not present. Next day the husband takes possession of his home. He kills a camel or a goat, according to his circumstances, and the meat is divided between the two families. The marriage is consummated that night, and next morning the bridal mat is displayed on the roof. During the following seven days the bride is secluded, without permission to see or speak with anyone. The levirate is practiced, and in compliance with this custom a widow who has completed her period of mourning is married by a younger brother of her dead husband. In physique and language the Tibbu and Teda differ from the Tuareg. Both have adopted the Mohammedan religion, but the inhabitants of Tibesti are stricter than the Tuareg in their religious observances. Like the Tuareg, the Tibbu and Teda are primarily concerned with breeding camels for caravan trade, but a sedentary population supplies agricultural produce, including dates. Milk from camels and goats is a staple of diet. The cultures, despite differences, are homologous, since both have similar environmental conditions to which the inhabitants have made the same kind of adaptations. Another instance of a desert culture based on the breeding and use of camels in caravan trade may be observed in the Libyan Desert. Here are situated several groups of oases, with long inter? vening stretches of barren, waterless desert. The line of oases near? est to the Nile includes Siwa and Kharga; then farther out in the desert are Arkenu, Kufra, and Ouenat. These oases are situated on</page><page sequence="371">Camel Keepers of the Sahara 375 an ancient and important caravan route from Darfur and Kordofan to northern Egypt, but as a result of French and British interference with slave traffic the prosperity of caravan trade has declined. The Libyan Oases The geographical background of Bedouin life in the Libyan Desert has been described by several explorers (section IV). Hassanein Bey (1924, p. 29) states that although the desert can be beautiful and kindly it is at other times overwhelming in its cruelty. "It is when your camels droop their heads from exhaustion, when your water supply has run short and there is no sign of the next well, when men are listless and without hope, when the map you carry is a blank because the desert is uncharted, and the guide when asked about the route answers that God knows best?then the Bedouin, having offered his prayers that remain ungranted, sinks down on the sands, draws his jerd around him and awaits death with astonishing equanimity." But if the desired oasis is reached, the caravan rests among wells, palms, and gardens. Food is abundant, and from a condition of extreme privation the traveler passes to one of plenty. The domestic animals of the oases are camels, sheep, horses, and donkeys. Articles of diet are mutton, chickens, butter, eggs, rice, tea?the two last items importations from the Mediterranean seaboard. In Kufra a system of irrigation produces maize, bananas, grapes, and barley. This agricultural background is much richer than that of the Tuareg of Air or the inhabitants of Tibesti, and the demand for imports is correspondingly greater. Therefore, caravan trade is stimulated. Within the oases the chief activities are cultivation, care of domestic animals, and industries that include manufacture of leather goods, baskets, and mats. The nomadic population is concerned entirely with caravan trade relieved by periods of rest in the oases. Reliable guides for long-distance journeys are few, and great honor is accorded to competent leaders. Interests and occupations of caravan men center in their camels. In addition to making equip? ment the men must care for the animals. Leather pads are sewn on the feet of footsore animals, and surgical operations are per? formed to relieve a disease known as "blood in the head." The Bedouins of the Libyan oases appear to have some affection for their camels, for a Bedouin, though tired, will sit by a sick camel and attempt to alleviate its suffering by playing for hours on his thin</page><page sequence="372">376 Source Book for African Anthropology reed pipes. When extolling the sagacity of camels, the Bedouins say that a young camel may truly claim "that if my mother drinks from a well while I am still in her womb, I could travel days to come back and drink at the same well." Most of the Bedouin Arabs of the Libyan oases belong to the Senussi brotherhood of Mohammedans. Hassanein Bey describes the Senussi as "a religious order whose leadership is hereditary, and which exerts a predominating influence in the lives of the people of the Libyan Desert." The founder of the order was Sayed Ibn Ali El Senussi, who was born in Algeria a.h. 1202 (see p. 390), which approximates to the year 1790 in the Christian calendar. He and his successors attempted a purification of Mohammedan belief and ritual. The leaders were distressed by the laxity of the Bedouins in failing to observe the fast of Ramadan, and in their substitution of a sacred stone (Kaaba) in Cyrenaica for the authentic stone to which pil? grimages should be made; this is situated at Mecca. The brother? hood founded schools called zawias from which trained teachers named ikhwan were sent to proselytize the Bedouins of the Libyan oases, the Teda and Tibbu of Tibesti, and the Tuareg. During the World War, the Senussi played an important political role in inciting Bedouins and Tuareg against the Italians and the French. In the year 1917, Sayed Idris, the head of the Senussi, whose headquarters are in the oasis of Jagabub, made a compact with the Italian govern? ment which gave him the administration of Kufra Oasis. In 1931 the Italian forces took punitive measures against the inhabitants of Kufra, which is now under Italian administration. Hassanein Bey reports that the Senussi were reserved and suspi? cious toward him, although he is a Mohammedan with command of the Arabic language. Rumor stated that he was a spy, and at no time could he make open use of his theodolite and other instruments. In common with most Mohammedans the Bedouins have an accretion of beliefs, some of which are early Semitic and pre-Moham medan. Jinns and affrits, the demons of Arabian folklore, are thought to live under the direction of the sheikh el affrit, the master of the demons. The rock drawings of Ouenat and even the desert itself are attributed to these demons. The desert is called belad esh Shaytn (country of the devil). Divination and omens are seriously regarded, and the evil eye is feared. Belief in a spiritual force called baraka is an element of religious life. The social organization is strongly paternal, with succession, descent, and inheritance in the male line. Social distinctions are</page><page sequence="373">Camel Keepers of the Sahara 377 strongly observed, some tribes being high in the social scale and others low. Dress, ownership of property, and ostentation support these distinctions. Families of importance have marks of ownership (wasmat) that are branded on camels. Women are veiled, but they are kept in seclusion only in the highest social classes. Girls are married at the age of fourteen years and boys when a few years older. Family and tribal blood-feuds are perpetuated. Negro slaves who were imported from the Sudan are well treated, and the slave classes think it better to serve a rich man than to have their freedom. A wealthy master shows his opulence by keeping his slaves well fed and gaily dressed. The treatment of slaves with respect to marriage, concubinage, inheritance, and the status of children is determined by Koranic teaching. The speech in these oases is Arabic; so also is the script used by educated men. Many minor customs are typical of Bedouin life in Arabia, Egypt, and north Africa. A salute is given by charging horsemen, who advance in line at the gallop, then pull their horses onto their haunches. Another courtesy is firing into the air to give a salute. Entertainments include a burlesque play known as a fantasia. Music and dancing, together with songs of love, war, and caravan journeys, are part of the intellectual life. Ceremonial meals are offered with lavish hospitality and great formality in serving the courses. Tea must be drunk with a sucking noise to show appreciation. A guest is fed by his host, who picks out pieces of food with his fingers and offers them personally. A host may light cigarettes and offer them to his guests. Violent belching during the meal is an expected mark of appreciation. summary Examination of the cultural patterns of Tuareg, Tibbu, and Bedouin Arabs of Libya has shown a typical picture of Saharan desert life, which is centered in the rearing of camels for warfare and caravan trade. Each of the tribes considered has nomadic and sedentary aspects of culture which are mutually dependent. Mohammedanism prevails throughout the areas considered, but with varying intensity. Many pre-Mohammedan traits of ancient Semitic pattern are functioning. Economically, socially, and spiritually, the Saharan cultures provide an example of homologies arising from use of camels and the necessity for adaptation of social patterns to environ? mental conditions. The Saharan cultures distinctly show the effects of a mingling of aristocratic Hamites and Semites with their Negro slaves.</page><page sequence="374">^^dSMBBSnSSfiuHillllllllllllllB^ ^^^Hiliiiiiiiiiiiil 378</page><page sequence="375">V. SEMITIC AND MOHAMMEDAN ELEMENTS The Arabian Background Before the study of Semitic and Mohammedan cultures in Africa is attempted, some acquaintance should be made with works describ? ing these cultures in Arabia, the place of their origin. Among the older books Robertson Smith's works (1889, 1907) seem to give the general social, religious, and economic background of early Arabia before a.d. 571. Doughty's "Arabia Deserta" (1888, 2nd ed. 1920) is a well-known classic, a masterpiece of descriptive writing which gives life and atmosphere to Arab culture. Hogarth has written "A History of Arabia" which deals with a knowledge of the Semites from a.d. 570 to the year 1914. Hogarth describes the fertile corner of southwest Arabia where the Minaean and Sabaean civilization flourished, but by the time of Aelius Gallus, who penetrated the hinterland of the Yemen in the year 26 b.c., the culture was dead and the desert had reclaimed the site. The work of J. Hell, translated from the German by S. Khuda Bukhsh (1936, pp. 94-121) is a student's most valuable source for obtaining a brief account of all that is really important concerning the history of Arabs in north Africa. Considerable information is compressed into small compass. For recent research in southern Arabia, B. Thomas (1929) should be consulted. Bedouin life has been well described by G. W. Murray (1935), Kennett (1926), Musil (1928), and in a short article by H. Field (1931). These writings will give a complete account of the type of Arabian and Egyptian Bedouin culture that has penetrated the oases in the hinterland of north Africa from Sinai to Mauretania. Irving's (1911) "Life of Mohammed," and Margoliouth's (1911) small textbook of Mohammedanism give all that is really necessary for understanding the social, religious, and economic aspects of Mohammedanism. The penetration of Islamic beliefs and practices into Negro tribes has been described by Andr? (1924), in "L'Islam noir," and Spanish Islamic traits are the subject of a work by Dozy (Stokes's translation, 1913). For more advanced study, R. Levy's (1933, 1935) volumes, "An Introduction to the Sociology of Islam," will prove sufficiently comprehensive. In the following pages of this section three fundamental divisions of Semitic culture will be described, and these correspond with the course of reading just outlined. Primarily, there is the basic Semitic 379</page><page sequence="376">380 Source Book for African Anthropology culture of unknown duration, long antedating the rise of Moham? medanism in Arabia; secondly, we have to recognize the cultural wave of Semiticism and Mohammedanism which swept northern Africa under the stimulus of the new religion of the Prophet; and, finally, a survey must recognize cultural accessories that tend to move with Mohammedanism without having any original or logical connection with that faith.

The Kababish The tribal life of the Kababish of Kordofan will serve to illus? trate essential points in the social pattern of early Semitic life in Arabia. C. G. and B. Z. Seligman(1918) point out that in Kordofan the geographical conditions are so similar to those of Arabia that environment has demanded little change in the mode of life which was characteristic of the ancient Semites in Arabia. This pastoral culture, which includes the breeding of camels, is typical of Arabian Bedouins of the present day, and in culture the Kababish resemble the Hamitic Beja of the Red Sea Province. The Kababish have Arab blood, mixed with that of their Negro slaves. There is also evidence of a mixture of Hamitic physique, and linguistic study shows</page><page sequence="377">Semitic and Mohammedan Elements 381 resemblances between the Arabic of the Kababish and the Hamitic speech of the Beja. economic conditions Although the Kababish esteem camels as a criterion of wealth, as beasts of burden, as a source of milk supply, and for sacrificial purposes on ceremonial occasions, the general culture of the Kababish differs in several essential ways from that of the camel-keeping Tuareg, Teda, and Senussi Arabs of the Sahara. In the parts of Kordofan inhabited by the Kababish, rainfall, though local and uncertain in quantity, is sufficient to encourage the breeding of cattle, sheep, goats, and horses. In this pastoral nomad Fig. 73. North and west African architecture, Kano, Nigeria. ism of the Kababish there is a blending of the Saharan camel culture with the pastoral life of Hamitic east Africa, and the two elements combine to give a social pattern which closely resembles Bedouin life, both ancient and modern, in Arabia. Geographical determinism is important in connection with a study of the social and economic life of the Kababish. During the period from July to September grass is plentiful, and the tribes of the confederacy are widely scattered. To prepare for drought the sheikh of each section sends out scouts to find water, which is to be found as subsoil reservoirs</page><page sequence="378">382 Source Book for African Anthropology at low levels long after the surface has become parched. The Kaba? bish then divide, so accommodating their social organization to economic needs in a way described in the Old Testament. Camel foals are born in the wet season, and when after a few months, they are able to run with the herd they are called mafrud. Other names are used to designate animals of two, three, four, and five years of age. For three years the milk teeth persist, but in the fourth year permanent teeth appear, and the second dentition is complete in the fifth year. Camels are not fully grown until their sixteenth year, but at the age of five years they are regarded as work? able. The duration of life is not usually more than forty years. The branding of camels is important as an indication of family histories, for when two persons marry and their herds are mingled the brands give a record of this union. The general name for brands is wasmat, but each mark has its own name and a form that indicates ownership and locality. H. A. MacMichael (1913) points out that the surprising knowledge of camel owners is due to careful observa? tion and accurate memorizing of the brands. In connection with the rearing of camels and other live stock several industries are important, and these have been described and well illustrated by Meinhof (1916). Making leather trappings is a staple industry; each item has a name, and some of the objects are ceremonially used. Tanning has a well-developed technique for removing the hair, for washing, scraping, and soaking in a tanning solution containing extract from acacia seeds. Water-skins and leather buckets for drawing water from wells are two of the important items made from hides of sheep and goats. Two articles of equip? ment are the utfa, an enclosure in which married women travel, and the tonkoh, which is used by a senior unmarried daughter. These structures are adapted for strapping on the backs of camels. The utfa has formed the subject of an article by A. E. Robinson (1931). Roofs of tents are constructed of camel-hair rugs (Fig. 72), which are made more protective against the heat by using with them rugs of sheep's wool and goat-hair. Thread spun from the hair of cam? els, sheep, and goats is woven into blankets and clothing on a prim? itive loom worked by women. This is a type of loom having a wide distribution among Bedouin Arabs of Africa and Arabia. Making baskets from fronds of the dum palm (Fig. 9, 6) is carried out by a coiling process, and after the coils have been stitched to? gether cowrie shells are added for ornament. Dyes of attractive colors are made. Typical industries are the manufacture of mats,</page><page sequence="379">Semitic and Mohammedan Elements 383 rope, and jointed woodwork without nails. From hard woods of the semi-desert, wooden cups, bowls, and platters are made. Pot? tery vessels are purchased from itinerant vendors. Sites of old iron workings may be seen in northern Kordofan, but the iron industry is now defunct. Spearheads are purchased from Omdurman, or they are made by itinerant blacksmiths. The food supply is derived from animals. Camels' milk is drunk by men, cows' milk by women, and goats' milk by children. Butter is made by shaking milk in a skin vessel along with a little sour milk; the liquid is then allowed to stand for twenty-four hours. Tea and coffee are purchased from Omdurman. The use of camel's flesh as food is restricted chiefly to ceremonial occasions, but mutton is a regular article of diet. Dried dates and partly baked unleavened bread are two principal articles of diet. Beer is made from the grain durra, which is the principal crop of the eastern Sudan. Only a small amount of cultivation is practiced; therefore, grain is purchased from neighboring sedentary tribes. With the exception of the gazelle, which is captured by a round foot-trap, Kordofan harbors little game, though sixty years ago ostriches were common, and giraffes were hunted. Warfare has declined, but in earlier days conflicts arose from disputes concerning rights to wells and pastures. The conquerors spared none of the men who fell into their hands, and all slave women, together with live stock and equipment, were the property of the victors. The Nurab, a section of the Kababish, used to have chain mail and quilted armor. These are in use today at Potiskum in northern Nigeria (Fig. 75, b) and at Niamey on the River Niger. Connected with warfare and horsemanship is the fantasia, which includes riding at the gallop and pulling up suddenly, also firing from the saddle. This custom prevails in Libya and Morocco. Songs alluding to battle and the prowess of the Kababish are com? posed by women, who chant them in praise of the warriors after the manner described in Old Testament history. social and religious life The Kababish are divided into sections and subsections, each of which is ruled by a sheikh who has inherited the right from his father. Superior to these rulers is a paramount sheikh who imposes taxes, and to whom appeals can be made against the legal decisions of minor rulers. In harmony with this hierarchy of chiefs, there exists a customary mode of travel and an arrangement of the camping ground according to rank.</page><page sequence="380">384 Source Book for African Anthropology Responsibilities of the chiefs of subtribes, and of heads of families are concerned with blood-feuds. A system of communal respon? sibility exists, and every male of a community in which a blood feud persists is, at least theoretically, in a state of war. The honor of a community is at stake until retribution for murder has been exacted either by taking a life or by securing blood-money. The old Semitic practice of taking sanctuary from an avenger prevails. Among the Kababish a man who flees from revenge may take ref? uge at the tomb of a saint, and the avengers must wait outside the enclosure until an agreement is made respecting the compensation. The power and responsibility of males under the patriarchal system is shown by their right of inflicting capital punishment in the family groups over which they rule. Should a man discover that his sister had become pregnant through adultery in the absence of her husband, he would kill her. But a woman's protectors are her brothers, who would begin a blood-feud if their sister were killed in this way. The Kababish regard a marriage between the children of two brothers (ortho-cousins) as the best form of union. This is contrary to the custom prevailing among many Negro tribes, who favor cross cousin marriage. Union between fathers' brothers' children, or be? tween mothers' sisters' children is regarded as incestuous under many typical Negro systems; but marriage with a mother's brother's child or with a father's sister's child is usually permitted, and even en? joined. The kinship terminology of the Kababish makes use of specific terms, one for each relative; this has been called a descriptive system. Negro tribes often employ a classificatory system in which one word denotes a group of relatives. For example, the Ovimbundu of Angola use the word nawa for all the in-laws of the speaker's own generation, and the word ndatembo indicates the in-law class of generations both older and younger than the speaker. Government by males, bequest of property in the male line, and succession to office through male lineage are characteristic of the Kababish, but traces of an older matriarchal and Semitic system may be observed. A bridegroom erects his tent near the dwelling of his bride's father, and usually this tent is not transferred to his own encampment until a year after the wedding. A strong influence of the wife's family persists, and a mother-in-law may refuse to have her married daughter taken far from home. In tents of the wealthier men are many female relatives of their wives. C. G. and B. Z. Seligman suggest that the present Kababish custom of mother-in-law avoid? ance (which also prevails among many Negro tribes) was a custom</page><page sequence="381">Semitic and Mohammedan Elements 385 of ancient Arabia, though evidence on this point is not conclusive. When a child is born, the father is called to the tent at the time when the umbilical cord is cut; this custom may be a survival of the transfer from mother-right to father-right. The laws of inheritance among the Kababish suggest a blending of customs of early Semitic Arabia and the operation of Mohamme? dan law. A man's property is bequeathed to his sons or his brothers according to old Hamitic-Semitic custom, but Koranic law requires that some property shall be inherited by the wives and daughters of the deceased. Divorce is obtained according to Koranic law, and, though divorce proceedings are usually originated by a husband, a wife may institute proceedings by returning to her father and taking her young children with her. The position of women among the Kababish is far from servile, and in the wealthier sections they do no manual work. But in sub tribes who are without slaves the women grind grain, tend cows, and make butter. Women do not veil as orthodox Mohammedans should, but they draw a head-cloth over the mouth in the presence of strangers. Free women are not carried off in war, for adultery is against Koranic teaching. The rights and social status of slaves and their children are determined by Koranic law. Treatment of children indicates a mixture of Mohammedan and pre-Mohammedan custom. Scarification, which is forbidden by the Koran, is practiced by the Kababish and other Mohammedan tribes of Kordofan, who make tribal marks. The heads of boys and girls are shaved by their paternal uncles when the children are seven months old, and at the time a sheep is sacrificed. The shorn hair is worn by the children in the form of girdles. Boys are cir? cumcised between the ages of seven and nine years. This is a com? pulsory Mohammedan rite, but it is one that was practiced in Egypt four thousand years before Mohammed was born. To per? form the ceremony the boy's foreskin is pulled through a hole in a piece of gourd. The foreskin is then tied tightly with thread, and after this operation a procession with musical instruments is led round the camp. At the conclusion of the parade excision of the foreskin is performed. A drastic operation performed on the sex organs of girls is older than Mohammedanism; possibly the custom was part of the ancient Semitic and Hamitic culture. This process of infibulation, which is performed between the third and the sixth years, results in a reduc? tion of the orifice of the vagina to such an extent that before</page><page sequence="382">386 Source Book for African Anthropology consummation of marriage an incision has to be made, and cutting is again necessary before childbirth. To prevent closing of the urinary meatus a small plug of wood is inserted until the surrounding scar tissue has formed. The operation results in removal of the external genitalia, including labia majora and mons veneris. Rites of circum? cision for boys and various operations on the sex organs of girls are common in Negro tribes, both Bantu and Sudanic. Such rites are also characteristic of some northeastern Bantu tribes, perhaps as a result of contact with eastern Hamites. Betrothal takes place between the ages of nine and eleven years, and marriage perhaps three years later. At the wedding feast, camels and sheep provided by the groom's father are killed and eaten; then a feast follows, with singing, dancing, and a fantasia. The prevalence of the Mohammedan faith is attested by the wearing of leather charms containing extracts from the Koran, or a little hair from a saint. The word baraka, a spiritual power which has been carefully described by Westermarck (1933) is used by the Kababish, as it is by the Libyan Bedouins and the Moors, to denote spiritual force, power, and blessing. Baraka is associated with holy men, and after their death this power is transmitted to their tombs and to fragments of their clothing. Fekis or holy men are consulted and paid for their enchantments, which include power to locate thieves and to make wandering camels return. The Kababish believe in lucky and unlucky days, which are distinguished by the aid of a feki. It is thought that some persons are born with an evil eye, whose glance may cause calamity. In view of their Semitic and Mohammedan culture the Kababish are exceptional in the absence of beliefs and stories connected with jinns, affrits, and ghuls, who are the monsters of Arabian folklore and the demons of the Koran. Burial is performed after the Mohammedan fashion, with the face of the corpse toward Mecca. A funeral feast is prepared one year after the burial, and on this occasion two she-camels, property of the dead man, are killed. The flesh is eaten by all except near relatives of the dead. The finest camels and horses of the deceased are paraded in their best trappings as part of the funeral ceremony. Examination of the cultural pattern of the Kababish tribe has served to show a blending of early Semiticism with orthodox Moham? medanism. Before Mohammed, Semitic life in Arabia had produced definite religious beliefs and practices, including a belief in Allah as a creator and a supreme god. Accompanying these theistic con? cepts were beliefs in demons who inhabited trees, stones, and</page><page sequence="383">Semitic and Mohammedan Elements 387 serpents. In the Kaaba or temple at Mecca 360 figures constituted a hierarchy of minor spiritual powers against which Mohammed directed his invectives. Semitic rites included a blood-brotherhood compact formed by sucking each other's blood, or by mingling the blood on a sacred stone. Expiatory sacrifices were common, and these included human sacrifice, also offerings of camels and cattle. The Semites regarded cattle as sacred animals to be killed for food only in times of dire need, and the butcher was regarded as unclean. Infanticide, which Mohammed discouraged, was a Semitic practice. Blood-feuds, blood-money, and the right of sanctuary were part of the Semitic social system. Relationship was reckoned in the paternal line and patriarchal conditions prevailed, but these had been preceded by a matriarchal state of society. The Semites observed many avoidances, including unclean animals and contacts with menstruating women. Reverence for holy places, offering first fruits, worship of animals, and the use of a scapegoat for bearing away the sins of the people were part of the ancient Semitic cultural pattern. On this complex of Semitic beliefs and practices was grafted orthodox Mohammedanism, which officially rejected some pagan rites and concepts while incorporating others, and adding new ideas and ideals. Semitism became institutionalized and con? solidated into a force that has swept through north Africa and east? ward through India into China. Mohammedanism Mohammed, who was born in the year 571 of the Christian era, sought to remedy the abuses of his time by denouncing all divine powers except the supreme Allah. The creed, 'There is no god but Allah, and Mohammed is his Prophet," forms the basis and the initiatory declaration of the Mohammedan faith. Trial by ordeal, cannibalism, infanticide, human sacrifice, and wooden idols were all proscribed, and in later times various sects introduced prohibi? tions of their own against alcoholic beverages, tobacco, coffee, and representation of human and animal forms in art. An abstemious life was enjoined by the Prophet, and in com? pliance with this requirement all true believers now annually observe the fast of Ramadan; this is a movable festival lasting from a certain new moon to the appearance of the next new moon. During this fast no food may be consumed between sunrise and sunset. Moham? med ordered his followers to pray five times a day, and to precede the prayers with ceremonial ablutions. The giving of alms,</page><page sequence="384">388 Source Book for African Anthropology circumcision, rules for warfare, and making a pilgrimage to Mecca are all important requirements. The Koran (Rodwell's Translation, 1909) gives a description of paradise as a fair garden of streams and fruit trees, where attractive women minister to the needs of the faithful. A graphic description of the torments of hell is the antithesis of this picture of paradise. Many stories of the Koran are taken from the Old Testament, which has contributed the story of Joseph, the Fall of Man, and the Deliv? erance of the Jews. From the New Testament, extracts relating to the Virgin Mary, Jesus, and the Apostles have been adopted. The religion of Mohammed is monotheistic, yet the Koran recognizes minor spiritual powers both good and evil; benevolent angels guard against the machinations of demons. The Koran teaches the value of humility, gentleness, patience, return of good for evil, truthful? ness, adoption of orphans, care of the sick, and avoidance of malice. As with other religions the precepts are excellent, but the practice is often negligible. Mohammedanism is popularly coupled with fatalism, but in the recognition of Allah as supreme ruler of the lives of men Mohammedanism is not inherently more fatalistic than Christianity. Behind the religious concepts of Mohammedanism lies a political theory that the Caliph as God's representative on earth is the head of an undivided Islamic state; but in practice deep rivalry has existed between political and religious divisions. The main sects, which are divided on points of theology, law, and ritual, are the Hanifites, Malekites, Hanbalites, and Shafeites, which are named after their founders. Of these schisms only the Hanifites and the Malekites are important in Africa. For all sects the Koran (the reading) is the supreme source of law, but disputes have arisen concerning the interpretation of passages. According to Mohammedan law, forcible conversion by warfare and the capture of slaves are legitimate practices. Slave raiding of Arabs among Negroes was accompanied by cruelty and forced marches, followed by sales that separated the members of families. But domestic slaves, when fully incorporated into a Mohammedan household, found reasonably kind treatment. They often rose to high rank, and a woman who had borne a child to her master could not be sold. At his death, the woman and her child became free. The Mohammedan criminal code has been harsh in its adoption of punishments by mutilation, and in the maintenance of foul</page><page sequence="385">9 o ? II d ? ?a| ^ I? I ft 389</page><page sequence="386">390 Source Book for African Anthropology prisons for debtors and malefactors. But in this respect Moham? medanism is no more reprehensible than Christian Europe in the Middle Ages, and later. Polygyny and concubinage are part of the social system, and women are at a disadvantage under Mohammedan divorce laws; but in Turkey and Egypt modern movements for the emancipation of women have recently advanced the social standing of females. In order to keep property within a family, marriage between the children of two brothers is favored. Bequests are made in the male line, and succession to office follows the same lineage. The levirate, by which a man marries his deceased brother's widows in order to beget children for him, is an ancient Semitic custom which was practiced by the Hebrews, and the usage still operates under Moham? medan law. Inheritance of a brother's widows is a frequent practice among Negro tribes, but the origin is not known to be Semitic, and the Negro institution may be of independent origin. In addition to these main characteristics of Mohammedanism, several secondary usages, beliefs, and economic patterns should be considered. The Prophet met with determined opposition which caused his flight from Mecca in a.d. 622, from which date Moham? medans make their historical reckoning. Therefore, events have different dates in the Mohammedan and Christian calendars. The Mohammedan year has a length of 354 days, 8 hours, and 48 min? utes. Consequently, the Mohammedan year lags behind the solar year about eleven days annually. The Mohammedan year is referred to as a.h. (Hegira, the flight), and a formula is used to convert a date a.h. to an approximate date a.d. Thus, a.h. 700 is approximately a.d. 1300. a.h. 1329 is a.d. 1911. A definite pattern of industrialism, which is focused in large markets, is a trait of Mohammedan life. Large bazaars are charac? teristic of Egypt, Tripolitania, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco. On the south side of the Sahara?Kano in northern Nigeria, and Tim? buktu on the bend of the Niger?are similar emporia where artisans congregate and caravan trade thrives. In the markets may be seen water-carriers with their goatskin containers, conjurers, wrestlers, buffoons, snake charmers, story tellers, diviners in sand, Punch and Judy shows, and marionettes. Musicians play pottery drums, instruments strung with horsehair, and wind instruments of the algaita type (L. Williams, 1934,</page><page sequence="387">?HnSm ;- ff Jj .a J?^H-HIIIII^K 391</page><page sequence="388">392 Source Book for African Anthropology pp. 77-98, has described Arab music). Itinerant barbers carry their implements in leather satchels which contain cupping horns for bleeding patients, knives for circumcising, razors for shaving, tweezers, and other toilet requisites. On the booths are displayed henna for staining the nails, kohl for darkening the eyes, and perhaps an outfit for tattooing. In some secluded corner of the market, a mallam sits writing charms, or he may be in charge of school children, who are writing Koranic texts on smooth boards, with ink and reed pens. At times they cease writing to chant the texts in unison. Certain sections of the markets are given to particular industries. Leather work for personal use and for use as trappings for horses and camels is a staple industry. Dye pits where indigo of native make is used are often seen, and a section of the market may be given to weavers, who use their own primitive African looms. Metal workers include black? smiths, silversmiths, and artisans, who expertly beat and cast objects in brass. With Mohammedanism are associated several distinctive types of architecture in which domes and minarets are prominent features. Interior decoration consists of tiles, mosaics, and geometrical drawing of great beauty and intricacy. Arabic script has contributed to much of the geometrical designing. A discrimination against human and animal forms in art is early Semitic, not specifically Mohammedan. The Hebrews were instructed not to make any image of anything on earth, in the firmament above, or in the sea beneath. Some Moham? medans follow this precept, and art is mainly geometrical, but exceptions occur. The fronts of houses are sometimes elaborately molded (Fig. 74, a). This type of architecture has spread from north Africa into the western Sudan. Clothing includes a flowing riga for men (Fig. 60, 6), the use of turbans, and several special articles for women (Figs. 58, 59, 6). For studying the penetration of material traits of Mohammedan culture into the Sudan, Paulitschke (1885), Gleichen (1905), and Frobenius (1897, 1923) are useful. In Mohammedanism religious concepts relating to morality, theology, literature, art, and philosophy are associated, as in other religions, with crude fanaticism, which is a degraded form of spiritual expression. The origin of bori dancing is unknown, but it is one of the baser elements attached to the Mohammedan faith. The bori are said by the Hausa communities of north Africa and the western Sudan to be a link with the world of demons. Each bori represents a particular disease, misfortune, or the evil eye, and in the dance of</page><page sequence="389">Semitic and Mohammedan Elements 393 exorcism men are dressed to represent the bori demons (Tremearne, 1913, 1914). The Hamaches of Morocco beat one another with whips and clubs as they parade the streets chewing thorny cactus, while the tearing and devouring of a living sheep is another of their practices. A zikr, as I saw it in the eastern Sudan, consisted of a dance given by men only, to the accompaniment of drums. The performers swayed to the rhythm of the instruments, meanwhile chanting the Koranic creed; this they did until they appeared dazed and intoxicated. Sometimes whipping one another with rawhide whips is part of the ceremony. These practices are comparable to the flagellation and self-persecution of Christian devotees. , The exercises are not a necessary part of the religion, but certain sects have become devotees of crude cults and practices. Arab-Berber Culture Consideration of a few details from the lives of Berber com? munities in north Africa which have a strong overlay of Moham? medanism, will serve to show the general pattern of life. The Berbers are a branch of the northern Hamites, and for the main part they retain their Berber (Hamitic) languages, though Arabic, espe? cially as the official language, is understood and spoken, particularly by men who are engaged in law and commerce. At the oasis of Siwa, about two hundred miles west of Cairo, there prevails great fear of the evil eye. If a stranger stares at a child, the mother takes sand from the stranger's footmarks, throws this on the fire and holds her naked child face downward over the smoke. Witchcraft, including the use of spells, charms, and love potions, is commonly practiced. The Siwani have a firm belief in the existence of jinns and affrits, some of whom have appeared in human form. The people say that in the year 1913 an afrit having red eyes and long talons appeared in the oasis in the dress of a Bedouin, who was immediately slain. All sickness is attributed to the evil eye. The Siwani are of early Libyan stock but their own Hamitic language has been superseded by an adulterated form of Arabic. They are Mohammedans of the Senussi sect, having a great aversion to foreigners. The Siwani do not own camels and few know how to take care of them, but sheep, goats, and donkeys are kept. Olive oil is produced in primitive presses, and many kinds of dates are grown, some for home consumption and others for export to Alexandria. Cline (1936) has given a condensed account of the industries,</page><page sequence="390">394 Source Book for African Anthropology economic life, religion, magical practices, and social organization. Numerous sketches illustrate the text, and a bibliography is given in form of footnotes. W. S. Walker (1921) deals with linguistic elements and some details of culture. Belgrave (1923) produced an informa? tive travel book. Some references to Siwa are given by Hassanein Bey (1924), and by W. J. H. King (1925). In southern Tunisia exist many small oases peopled by Bedouin Arabs of the Mohammedan faith (Vivian, 1899). The patriarchal system is carried to its farthest limits so that the head of a family is absolute. Belief in the evil eye prevails, but the malign effects can be averted by saying, "Tabark Allah11 (May God preserve them). Steaming grain (kus-kus) in a perforated pot, and the roasting of a sheep whole are typical culinary habits of the Bedouins. In Tunisia, as well as in Algeria and Morocco, nargile water-pipes are used for smoking tobacco. Kif is a mild kind of hemp prepared from the flowers of the plant, and used for smoking. Bang is a preparation of hemp taken in the form of pills. In the towns are addicts of opium, which is smoked or taken as pills. The festival of Biram is observed; this is a carnival that follows immediately after the fast of Ramadan. Use of the bastinado as a punishment is probably not an Arab but a Turkish introduction. Amusements include marionettes and the fantasia. The institutions of blood-feuds, blood-money, and taking sanctuary from avengers are strongly operative. The Bedouin tribes of Tunisia combine agricultural and pastoral pursuits. The latter include rearing of camels and sheep, and the former depends on a primitive system of plowing in which camels are used. Water is drawn from wells in leather buckets, which are hauled up by camels. Tunisian industries include making dyes, tanning leather, and weaving woolen textiles on a vertical loom. The observations of D. Bruun (1898) remove the impression that ancient Semitic and more modern Mohammedan customs are confined to Bedouin Arabs. He states that the Khrumirs, who are dark-skinned Berbers of Tunisia, pursue the blood-feud unrelentingly, and they will seldom accept blood-money as compensation for a murder. They observe the fast of Ramadan but do not pray; yet great virtue and healing power are associated with the tombs of saints (marabouts), whose power is transmitted by the use of small articles that were associated with these holy men. One tomb is noted for the healing of fevers, and another for protection of crops. Most of the Tunisian Arabs are nomads who live in the southern and central regions. The Mohammedan religion prevails, though the faith is adulterated with grosser practices.</page><page sequence="391">Semitic and Mohammedan Elements 395 From southern Tunisia, and from Murzuk in southwest Tripoli tania, coastal caravan trade is linked up with Tuareg caravans that carry merchandise across the Sahara into Bornu. The utfa is used by married women who are traveling on camels. Hilton-Simpson (1926) gives a picture of the lives of Kabyles in the Aures Mountains of Algeria, and he describes Bedouin life in the oasis of Djemora at the foot of the Aures Massif. This oasis is the camping ground of the Ouled Ziane, nomad Arabs who wander in winter driving their flocks of sheep and goats over the desert to the southwest of the Aures. After these excursions they return to their oasis to pick the date crop. In the fertile valleys, peaches, apricots, pears, figs, and olives are grown. Crude spiritual beliefs prevail under a veneer of Mohammedan? ism. Feeble-minded persons are regarded as holy, and the evil eye is everywhere feared. Extension of five fingers while saying "Khamsa fi ainek" (five in thine eye) wards off the evil glance. The extended hand, sometimes called the hand of Fatima, daughter of Mohammed, is made in the form of silver charms to be worn around the neck (Hilton-Simpson, 1915). Cooking a lamb whole and serving it on a brass tray are typical Bedouin customs. Each guest mutters "bis millah" (in the name of God) while helping himself with his fingers. Writing Koranic texts and encasing them in leather satchels is an occupation of the mallams. Primitive surgery, including trephining, has formed the subject of an article by Hilton-Simpson (1922). Hildburg (1906, 1913-1915) has shown the extension of Moham? medan magic and charms into Spain. The study of M. Gaudry (1928) has provided a complete sociologi? cal investigation into the lives of Mohammedanized Kabyle women. Women have well-developed arts of dyeing, weaving, and making pottery. Females till the soil; and agricultural rites, some of them of ancient Phoenician origin, are observed. Both men and women may be marabouts with hereditary office. Worship includes visits to tombs where prayers are offered, candles are burned, and offerings of food are made. Religious exercises include use of a rosary. Sorcery is widely practiced, and love philters are employed. The word Moor has no precise ethnological significance, since the term is primarily geographical. In physique a Moor may be a Berber, an Arab, or a mixture of the two, with Negro blood as well. A Moor speaks Arabic or a Berber dialect, or he may be bilingual, using spoken and written Arabic in his work and speaking Berber in his home. Mondadori (1926) has analyzed the composition of the</page><page sequence="392">396 Source Book for African Anthropology population of Tripolitania. Berbers in language and custom are 24 per cent of the total population; Berbers who have adopted the Arab language and customs form 31 per cent; Arabs constitute 36 per cent; and the residue of 9 per cent is Jewish and Negroid. A sound concept of what is meant by "Moorish" culture, in its religious, social, and industrial aspects, may be derived from a com? prehensive and well-illustrated study by Meakin (1902). Religious beliefs, magic, charms, folklore, and the blood-feud have been adequately dealt with by Westermanck (1926, 1933, 1934). Coon (1931), also Bertholon and Chantre (1912), have described the Berber culture of north Africa. M. S. Dimand (1930) has produced a comprehensive and well-illustrated summary of Mohammedan art, and P. Ricard (1918) has written a short article on that subject. Similarities between the Bedouin life of the north African 'hinter? land, Sinai, and Arabia is well demonstrated in the works of G. W. Murray (1935), Kennett (1926), and H. Field (1931). Within this complexity of early Semitic, Mohammedan, and Hamitic factors, traits have intruded from the civilizations of Egypt, Phoenicia, Greece, and Rome. The only effective way of clarifying the situation is to compre? hend the cultural meaning of early Semiticism, to trace out the growth of Mohammedanism from a.d. 600, to find the Berber (Hami? tic) elements in the north African cultures, and, finally, to allow for the Phoenician, Byzantine, Roman, and Greek elements of speech, observance, and material culture that have survived. reading Berber Civilization.?Perhaps the best account in small compass is that of Bourrilly (1932), who from long residence is able to give an intimate account (in French) of Berber life and customs. Bas? set's (1910) research into the factors of Berber religious beliefs is a well-known standard work. A. van Gennep (1911) has published detailed and amply illustrated accounts of Berber industries. The ancient and basic traits of Berber civilization are considered by Randall-Maclver and Wilkin (1900) and Bates (1914), in their studies of the ancient Libyans. Renan's (1873) analysis of Berber society is an old classic, and Wilkin's (1900) description of Berber life in Algeria is useful. The Kabyles.?Many studies of Berber civilization are cen? tered about the culture patterns of various groups of Kabyles. Maunier (1926) has devoted a volume to the description of their</page><page sequence="393">Semitic and Mohammedan Elements 397 dwellings. Hanoteau and Letourneux (1893) have described cus? toms of the Kabyles. Myres (1902) has given an account of Kabyle pottery. The article of Lissauer (in German, 1908) is well known, and in addition to this he has prepared a brief article in English (1911), dealing with Kabyle customs. Nomadism.?Hubac (1931) has given a brief pictorial and popular account of Bedouin life in Tunisia (in French). In German, Stuhlmann (1914) has prepared an article on the Mazigh people (South Tunisia). Gautier's (1921) account of "Nomad and Seden? tary Folks of Northern Africa" is a brief contribution to this subject. De Agostini, writing in Italian (1917, 1923), has discussed both the sedentary and nomadic populations of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica. And A. van Gennep (1912) has written a brief article on "North African Gypsies."</page><page sequence="394">VI. AGRICULTURE Consideration of the religious background of agriculture will serve as an introduction to the whole of section III, dealing with Negroes, since the enormous area of Negro occupation (Map 4, Areas 6A, 6a, 6B) is primarily an agricultural zone. A brief outline of the principal food plants, with notes on their history and distribution, has been given in section I, chap. I; neither is it necessary to deal here with the routine of agricultural operations. Clearing the bush, hoeing, terracing, irrigation, manuring, storing of grain, and preparation of foods will be described along with occupa? tions and handicrafts. Typical dwellings of agricultural Negroes are shown in Fig. 76. We are concerned here only with a brief account of the spiritual basis of life in agricultural communities. And, provided this funda? mental religious factor is understood, the whole social and economic pattern will be explicable. The main beliefs and institutions in agricultural organization are given below: (1) A religious concept of land as the property of dead ancestors. There may also be an idea of a Sky Father and an Earth Mother. (2) Spiritual concept of a chief or king who acts as a high priest in agricultural rites. (3) A medicine-man, who may be an official rain-maker, a preparer of charms to protect crops, an interpreter of omens, and a functionary in supplication and sacrifice. Usually a complex association exists between (2) and (3), but in many communities the different powers and functions are clearly defined. (4) Division of agricultural labor between the sexes. Local custom varies considerably. (5) Time reckoning, lunar observations, and agricultural opera? tions are logically connected. (6) Legal procedure is largely connected with ownership of land, succession, and infringement of rights. Ownership of land is the economic basis of family life and of cohesion in the village community. A sociological theory of nutrition as expounded by A. I. Richards (1932) develops the thesis that human relationships within a tribe are determined by nutritional needs. "Hunger shapes the sentiments which bind together the members of each social group." By a study of home conditions, the family, infancy, kinship sentiment, the 398</page><page sequence="395">Agriculture 399 economic functions of chiefs, and worship of ancestors, the inter? relation of parts of tribal life is demonstrated. Criticism of such an exposition can be directed only against the apparent assumption that one trait is more fundamental than ff 6 Fig. 76. Houses of agricultural Negroes. a. Village scene, Cameroons. 6. House with painted walls, near Bailundu, Angola. another. Admittedly, the tribe must eat to live; biologically speak? ing, the need for food is basic in society. But just as logically one might entitle the study "Chieftainship," or "Ancestor Reverence," with a view to showing that these factors are absolutely indispensable, since without the blessing of the ancestors, and in the absence of a</page><page sequence="396">400 Source Book for African Anthropology chief as intermediary priest, no food could be produced. Fertility of soil and germinating power of seed depend on the chief's blessing of seed, the mixing of his own grain with that of his subjects, and the direction of prayers to ancestors asking for rain. The offering of the first fruits to the gods is again a priestly function without which the efforts of the cultivators would be void. In a functional study it matters little whether we first analyze the social conditions, the religious beliefs, or the economic structure, for the main aspects of tribal life are so closely related that the probing of one division leads immediately to a recognition of psychological and sociological unity. The following instances have been chosen from agricultural areas wide apart in order to show the unity of beliefs in Negro communities, despite differences in physique and language. agricultural rites of sudanic negroes The relationship between land tenure, inheritance of land, and religious beliefs is explained by R. S. Rattray (1923, p. 217). Ashanti laws regulating the ownership and bequest of land are typical of widely spread Negro concepts relating to possession of land and the enjoyment of usufructs. The Ashanti entertain the belief that living landowners hold their land as trustees for their dead ancestors, a fact which accounts for determined opposition to the sale of land, which is required by Europeans. Rattray (1923, p. 203) states that in Ashanti the ceremony of offering first fruits of the yam crop to ancestors is still observed. The festival is connected with recog? nition of Tano, the greatest of the earth gods. The part played by a reigning king as a priestly mediator with his ancestors will be described later in connection with a study of the sacredness of kings. The importance of religious ritual in connection with agriculture has been noted by H. Labouret (1931, p. 368), who says that the religious character of land tenure is connected with a cult of the earth god. He gives instances of prayer and sacrifice to such a divinity when new land is occupied for making a village site. Plateau tribes of Nigeria observe a ceremonial eating of first fruits. A chief is first to partake, and he makes an offering of the first produce to ancestral spirits. When clearing his land, a farmer of the Kagoro tribe pours out beer and prays that the ground may be fertile. The Kagoma perform rites in a sacred grove, and during the days of observance sexual intercourse is forbidden. A favorite wife of a dead chief assists with the sowing, and when the crop is a foot high certain ceremonial acts are necessary.</page><page sequence="397">Agriculture 401 Before eating the first of the yam crop, a chief of the Yoruba publicly sacrifices a dog. The headman of each village is responsible for this ceremony; songs of thanksgiving are sung, and the head of each family has to make a sacrifice to ancestors in his own home. C. K. Meek (1925, vol. 1, pp. 119-133) emphasizes the importance of ceremonial in assuring abundant crops but points out that many Nigerian tribes have a technique that makes use of irrigation, rota? tion of crops, manuring, and allowing land to lie fallow for periods. According to N. W. Thomas (1913, Part I, pp. 37-41), an Ibo farmer of the Awka district is expected to sacrifice a fowl to the ancestral spirits of people who previously owned the property. This is another apt illustration of the fact that no man is absolute possessor of the land he cultivates. Should the ghosts of previous owners be neglected, they will send wild animals to eat the yams. In Sierra Leone an agricultural deity named Kumba is recognized, and for him the people weep at the beginning of the agricultural season. When rice is planted in a small plot reserved for Kumba, the children sing, "We cry for Kumba; they are planting his rice on this day, and no one may do any work." The rice in this sacred patch of Kumba is left uncut, since the grain belongs to Kumba, and he would destroy the whole crop if his property were violated. Old rites included the offering of rice on graves of ancestors, for if this were not done the ghosts would catch hold of the hoes. At harvest time Kumba again has his offering, and the krifi have to be placated in the same way, since they are mischievous spirits who steal the rice. During some rites sexual continence has to be observed, or the cassava will be bitter and the husks of groundnuts will be empty (N. W. Thomas, 1916, Part I, pp. 174-176). M. Delafosse (1931, p. 162) states that, according to the laws of west African Negroes, land does not belong to a private owner, nor is it community property. "In fact, the ground is a god that no one would think of appropriating to himself, and still less of buying and selling." In former times a Negro family, when first arriving on untenanted land, made sacrifice to a local god in order to obtain divine consent to the use of the land. The right so acquired was transmitted in the family, and no transfer of land could be made without a religious ceremony. Most west African Negro conquerors have respected the religious aspect of land tenure, and they have conceded that conquest gives no right to occupation of the soil. This attitude toward land owner? ship is in harmony with many religious beliefs. The Ashanti, for</page><page sequence="398">402 Source Book for African Anthropology instance, regard the sky and the earth as their two greatest deities, and according to mythology some of the clans sprang from the earth. A day is set aside for the observance of Mother Earth, and offerings are made to the ground spirit by killing fowls and allowing their blood to drip on the earth on the day when tillage is begun. As a further study of religious attitudes in agriculture, G. H. Jones (1936) should be consulted. The article deals with the Earth Goddess and native farming in west Africa. agricultural rites of bantu negroes In his account of land tenure among the Bathonga, H. A. Junod (1912, vol. 2, p. 135; passim) points out the function of a chief as a distributor of land and not an absolute owner. Land is granted for cultivation to all tribesmen who have acknowledged the supremacy of the chief, but possession of land depends on continuous occupa? tion and cultivation. Real estate is hereditary in the male line to sons, who apportion the land among their wives, but, in accordance with general Negro procedure, these temporary owners have no right to sell their plots. After land has been assigned to subjects, a chief, no matter how high his social position, has no rights in the land, and he would have to ask permission to pick up a single piece of fallen fruit from land granted to a subject. Junod's description of agrarian, religious rites reveals the basic idea of ancestors, and ancestors who have become gods, as the real owners of the land. The Bathonga observe several points of ritual in connection with agriculture and woodcraft. Before a tree is cut down, the bark is smeared with drugs, which are also used for burning at the root of the tree, and before felling a mahogany tree an offering is made to ancestral spirits. The Bathonga sow maize without a ceremonial act, but sowing of millet requires a special rite. Probably millet is by far the older grain, and so became associated with deeply entrenched and ancient ceremonial, which was not transferred to more recently imported grains. To prepare the millet for sowing, a chief chews the root of a plant, then blows on a quantity of millet which is afterwards mixed with the general supply of millet belonging to his subjects. This rite is said to keep ants from the seed. A few taboos and observances are connected with sowing of Kafir peas. Men must plant the peas, but after this only women may enter the field, for a man who does so would be afflicted with hydrocele.</page><page sequence="399">Agriculture 403 The prohibitions associated with threshing are strict. Men are forbidden to approach the threshing floors. A relative of the owner of a field is not allowed to pluck spikes of maize for himself, but he may do so if he threshes the corn before taking it away. People are conservative in their attitude toward changes. They resent the introduction of new grains or methods, and to the first man who planted a mango tree the people said, "You will die." The plow has, however, been accepted. The Bathonga make offerings of agricultural produce to their ancestral gods, and leaves of tobacco are presented to both the maternal and the paternal ancestors. Gods and chiefs have a prior right to first fruits of the soil, and for anyone to forestall this right by eating of the first produce would be a serious offence likely to bring misfortune on the community. A principal agricultural ceremony is that known as the luma of the Kafir corn, at which rite the great wife of the chief crushes the first grain and mixes with it a substance called the royal powder. The chief offers this mixture to ancestral spirits at the main entrance to his kraal. He prays "that the Kafir corn shall keep our bodies so that they shall become fat and not thin." Following this ceremony, the corn is eaten by chiefs, subchiefs, councilors, and warriors who have killed enemies in battle. The harvest is in this way made available for commoners. D. Shropshire (1934, No. 86) states that in the Wabarwe tribe the Midzimu are ancestral spirits of the family, who require offerings at their shrine especially at the time of the first rains. "The spir? its are very angry if we do not offer before planting," the people say, "and if you stint them they can call the birds to finish all your crops." The Ba-ila know little of the principles of agriculture. They do not allow their land to lie fallow for a period, neither do they adopt a rotation of crops or recognize the necessity for selection of seed. Manure is not used. But a firm belief that successful agriculture depends on religious observances is preserved. To work on the day after the first rain is regarded as an offence against the giver of rain; therefore, such an act would jeopardize success. People who "have a lucky hand for sowing" are engaged in this work, and at harvest time each man takes corncobs and hangs them from the rafters in his hut. This grain is an offering to his ancestral spirits (E. W. Smith and A. M. Dale, 1920, vol. 1, pp. 135-138). The fact that women mold female breasts and serpents on the corn bins suggests some</page><page sequence="400">404 Source Book for African Anthropology ancient fertility cult having these designs as symbols. In African ophiolatry the snake is closely associated with rainbows and rain, and the reptile is widely regarded as an announcer of conception. Details of agricultural operations vary; the crops themselves are different, and the ritual takes many forms. But the mainspring of life in the Negro area now to be described is the sacredness of the land and the spiritual approach to cultivation.</page></plain_text>
