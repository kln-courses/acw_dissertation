<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mircea Eliade AUSTRALIAN RELIGIONS: AN INTRODUCTION PART I* There is a general belief among the Australians that the world, man, and the various animals and plants were created by certain Supernatural Beings who afterward disappeared, either ascending to the sky or entering the earth. The act of "creation" was not so much a cosmogony as it was a molding and transformation of a pre-existent material; it was not a creatio ex nihilo but the shaping of an amorphous cosmic substance that had already existed before the appearance of the Supernatural Beings. In a similar fashion, the "creation" of man was rather a modification of a previously shapeless or monstrous being. The myths tend to emphasize the morphological completion and spiritual instruction of the primeval man rather than his coming to life from a pre-existent material form. Man was truly made when he received his present form and when the religious, social, and cultural institutions which were henceforth to constitute the most precious heritage of his tribe were revealed to him. The coming into being of man and the actual world took place in the "Dream Time"-the alchera or alcheringa time, to use the Aranda terms for this primordial and fabulous epoch. The physical * This is the first of a series of articles on "primitive" religion.

Nowhere in Australia do these creative acts of the "Dream Time" personages impress us with their grandeur. As a matter of fact, the majority of the central Australian "creation myths" tell only of the long and monotonous wanderings of different types of Primordial Beings; in the course of these wanderings they modified the landscape, pro- duced plants and animals, and performed a series of "rituals" which ever since have been scrupulously repeated by the abori- gines. The narratives of these creative acts constitute what we call "myths"; indeed, they are "sacred" and serve as foundations and justifications for the entire religious life of the tribe. The "Dream Time" came to an end when the Supernatural Beings left the sur- face of the earth. But the mythical past was not lost forever; on the contrary, it is periodically recovered through the tribal rituals. As we shall see, the most sacred and especially the secret ceremonies are supposed to reactualize the mythical events, thus rendering present the fabulous time of the beginnings. As is the case with all other "primitive" religions, to understand the Australian religion ultimately means to know what happened in illo tempore, that is to say, what type of Primordial Beings made their appearance at the very beginning, what kind of activity they carried out-and to what purpose-and what became of them afterward. As is to be expected, the most animated debate between scholars has been the one concerned with the type or structure of the Primordial Beings: were they Sky Gods, "All-Fathers"; therio- morphic mythical ancestors; ghosts of famous chieftains? This con- troversy is extremely significant both for the comprehension of Australian religions and for the history of the understanding of archaic religions by Western scholars-in fact, the debate is reveal- ing for the history of the modern Western mind in general. For this reason we shall dwell in some detail on the discussion concerning a specific class of Australian Primordial Beings, the so- called All-Fathers or Sky Beings of the southeastern tribes. As these populations have disappeared or have been too rapidly civilized, we do not possess their complete mythologies. But enough information has been gathered by observers during the second half of the nineteenth century, and particularly by A. W. Howitt, to enable us to grasp the structure of their religions. The main characteristic of all these populations is their belief in super- natural Sky Beings. To simplify this presentation, I will use almost exclusively the data of Howitt. But references to some of the 109</page><page sequence="3">Australian Religions: An Introduction earlier authorities will be made later on, when we will discuss the impact of Howitt's observations on contemporary scholarship. THE SKY BEINGS OF SOUTHEAST AUSTRALIA In his book on the Narrinyeri tribe, published in 1847, George Taplin wrote that these aborigines "call the Supreme Being by the names Nurrundere and Martummere. He is said to have made all things on the earth, and to have given to men the weapons of war and hunting, and to have instituted all the rites and ceremonies which are practised by the aborigines, whether connected with life or death. On inquiring why they adhere to any custom, the reply is: Nurrundere commanded it. Nurrundere went to Wyrra-warre, taking his children with him."' Wyrra-warre is said to be the sky, and Taplin adds that "the Narrinyeri always mention his name with reverence." He relates that during a great kangaroo hunt, "on reaching the hunting-ground, a wallaby, which had been killed on the road thither, was produced, and a fire kindled by the women. Then the men standing round, struck up a sort of chant, at the same time stamping with their feet. The wallaby was put on the fire, and as the smoke from it ascended, the hunters, at a concerted signal, rushed towards it, lifting their weapons towards heaven. I afterwards learned that this ceremony was instituted by Nurrun- dere." 2 This scene recalled to Howitt the commencement of a cer- tain ritual, when the men pointed to the sky with their weapons or with branches, "as indicating the great Biambun, whose name is not lawful to mention excepting at the ceremonies, and only when initiated persons are present." 3 Another tribe, the Wiimbaio, believes that Nurelli made the whole country, together with its trees and animals. After giving laws to the aborigines he went up to the sky, and he is now one of the constellations.4 According to the myths of Wotjobaluk, Bunjil, the Supreme Being, once lived on the earth as a Great Man but eventually ascended to the sky. Bunjil is also called "Our Father." 5 Other Supreme Beings of the southeastern tribes-Baiame, Dara- mulun, Mungan-ngaua-likewise are spoken of as "fathers." 1 George Taplin, The Narrinyeri.

Howitt, The Native Tribes of South-East Australia (hereinafter cited as "Native Tribes") (London, 1904), p. 488.

Bunjil taught the Kulin the arts of life and social institutions. Then he ascended to the sky land; from there he supervises the tribe. Howitt points out that this celestial being was usually referred to as Mami-ngata, that is, "Our Father," rather than by his name Bunjil. Howitt was also impressed with the fact that the human element predominates over the animal in these myths.7 It is important to note that knowledge of the names and myths of these Supreme Beings of the southeastern tribes is restricted to the initiates. Women and children know almost nothing about them. Among the Kurnai, for example, the women know only that there is a Supreme Being in the sky called Mungan-ngaua, "Father of All of Us." 8 In fact, it is only during the final and most secret stage of the initiation that the novice learns the most essential myth-namely, that Mungan-ngaua lived on the earth a long time ago and taught the ancestors of the Kurnai all the elements of their culture. Mungan-ngaua founded the secret rites of the initiation (jeraeil), and his married son, Tundum, conducted them for the first time, using the two bull-roarers that bear the names of him and his wife. But a traitor revealed the mysteries of the jeraeil to the women. In his anger Mungan-ngaua brought on a cosmic cataclysm in which almost the entire human race perished; soon afterward he ascended into the sky. His son Tundum and Tun- dum's wife were both turned into porpoises.9 There is obviously a great difference between what was known before the initiation-the fact that there is a celestial "Father" whose voice resembles that of the distant thunder-and what the neophyte discovers in the course of the secret rites. He learns the myth of the Supreme Being: his creative deeds, his anger, and his disappearance from the earth. He also learns that the disappear- ance of Mungan-ngaua brought to an end a fabulous period. In sum, the neophyte discovers that a series of dramatic and some- times catastrophic events took place in a mythical past. As we shall see, the revelation of the secret and traditional "sacred 6 Ibid., pp. 490-91. 7 Ibid., p. 492. 8 Howitt once met an old woman, a survivor of the Theddora tribe, and when he asked her about Daramulun she answered: "All that I know of Daramulun is that he comes down with a noise like thunder, to make the boys into men. We call him Papang" (ibid., p. 493). Papang, Howitt explains, means "Father." The "noise like thunder" is that of the bull-roarers. 9 Ibid., p. 630. See also M. Eliade, Birth and Rebirth (New York, 1958), pp. 10-31. 111</page><page sequence="5">Australian Religions: An Introduction stories" constitutes the core of every Australian initiation cere- mony, even among those tribes that do not share the belief in a celestial Supreme Being. To help complete the picture afforded by our scanty data of the southeastern tribes, we might add a few more examples. According to the Kamilaroi, Baiame created all things. Though generally in- visible, Baiame has appeared in human form, bestowing various gifts on the tribe.10 During his initiation the Yuin novice learns the myth of Daramulun ("Father"; he is also called Biamban, "Master"). Long ago, Daramulun dwelt on earth with his mother. The earth was barren, hard, and sterile as a stone-and there were no human beings, only animals. Daramulun created the ancestor of the Yuin and taught him how to live. He gave him the laws which are handed down from father to son, founded the initiation ceremonies, and made the bull-roarer, the sound of which repre- sents his voice. It is Daramulun who gives the medicine men their powers. And when a man dies, Daramulun meets and cares for his spirit.11 As Howitt has already pointed out, all of these names-Bunjil, Baiame, Daramulun, etc.-most probably refer to the same divi- nity. "He is evidently everlasting, for he existed from the begin- nings of all things, and he still lives." 12 There is no doubt that the belief in such a celestial Supreme Being belongs among the most archaic and genuine traditions of the southeastern aborigines. The belief was witnessed before the installation of the Christian mis- sions. Furthermore, as we have noted, the names, the myths, and the rituals associated with the High Beings are most secret, being revealed exclusively to the initiates. If the Supreme Being should be suspected of being merely a result of missionary propaganda, one must wonder why he is unknown to the women and why he be- came so central to those religious and social traditions that belong to the mythical past.13 We might add that the same type of divi- nity, considered to have created the world and man and to have ascended to heaven after bestowing upon man the rudiments of culture, is attested in many other archaic religions. It is difficult for us to imagine that missionary propaganda would have given 10 Howitt, Native Tribes, p. 494. 11 Ibid., p. 495. 12 Ibid., p. 500. 13 Ibid., pp. 501 ff. Schmidt examined the value of Howitt's personal observa- tions at great length and criticized some of his conclusions; see Ursprung, I, 211-47, 296-301, etc.; see also Vol. III (Miinster, 1931; xlvii+ 1155 pp.), Index, 8.V. 112</page><page sequence="6">rise everywhere to the same type of divinity and to the same my- thological pattern. THE STORY OF A CONTROVERSY When Howitt published his book in 1904, most of the facts con- cerning the Supreme Beings of southeast Australia were already known from his own articles in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute (JAI), 1882-87,14 and also from the information brought together by Andrew Lang in his work The Making of Religion (London, 1889). One may suspect that, without the intervention of Lang, the facts communicated by Howitt would have played a more important role in the interpretation of Australian religion. As a matter of fact, in the 1904 monograph Howitt watered down his first evaluation of the High Gods, as presented in the articles of the JAI. One reason for this change of mind might have been the tumult raised by Lang's book. It is true that E. B. Tylor, in his article "Limits of Savage Religion" (JAI, XXI [1891], 283-301), had tried to explain the Australian High Gods in terms of the direct or indirect influence of Christian missionaries. Nonetheless, this hypothesis was not very convincing, although in some in- stances a Christian influence was plausible.15 But in pleading for the authenticity of the Australian beliefs Lang had made the mis- take, astutely pointed out by E. S. Hartland,16 of presenting the Australian gods almost in Christian terms. Hartland rightly re- marked that the Australians do not speak of "immortality" or "eternity" but of "very long life." (What Hartland did not realize was that these plastic expressions, "long life," "old age," etc., fill the same function as the "immortality" or "eternity" of the other, more elaborate religions.) Another methodological error was Lang's tendency to consider the mythical element as secondary or aberrant. Lang labeled as "myths"-which for him were "obscene or humorous tales"- everything he did not like in a "primitive" religion; we shall dwell 14 See, e.g., the following articles by A. W. Howitt in the JAI: "On Some Australian Beliefs" (XIII [1884], 185-98); "The Jeraeil, or Initiation Ceremonies of the Kurnai Tribe" (XIV [1885], 301-27); "On the Migration of the Kurnai Ancestors" (XV [1886], 409-27); and "On Australian Medicine Men" (XVI [1887], 23-58). 15 Howitt knew from his long and intensive work among the southeastern Australian tribes that Tylor's theory was untenable. See also N. W. Thomas, "Baiame and the Bell-Bird," Man (1905), pp. 44-52; Schmidt, Ursprung, I, 249 ff. 16 See E. S. Hartland, "The 'High Gods' of Australia," Folk-lore, IX (1898), 290-329. 113</page><page sequence="7">Australian Religions: An Introduction upon this ideological prejudice later on. He was nevertheless im- pressed by Hartland's criticism, and in his reply he reminded his opponent that already in his Myth, Ritual and Religion (Vol. I [London, 1901], chap. xi) he had admitted the coexistence of "the mythical and the religious elements in beliefs."17 But Hartland rightly emphasized that this implies an acknowledgment of the justice of his criticism.18 Lang continued to fight for the recognition of Howitt's dis- coveries; he even fought against Howitt's own interpretation of his discoveries. In an article entitled "God (Primitive and Savage),"19 Lang once again summarized his arguments in favor of the authen- ticity of the Australian All-Fathers, first quoting the following letter written by Baldwin Spencer to J. G. Frazer on August 19, 1902: As to the "discovery" of a high ethical religion amongst the lowest savages there is not, I am convinced, any such thing in Australia. The great difficulty is that we have had statements made on the authority of men like Gason. The latter was a police-trooper, I believe, who was per- fectly honest, but at the same time perfectly incapable of dealing with matters such as these. In the days when the evidence of Baiame and Daramulum was collected the importance of securing minute and de- tailed information was really not realized, nor was it imagined that there were men without any so-called religious ideas; and as I have endea- voured to point out in one of our chapters, it is the easiest thing possible to be misled by what a native tells you in regard to such a point as this.20 But Lang sarcastically remarks ("God [Primitive and Savage]," p. 244a), "Spencer must have forgotten that the chief authority on Daramulun is Howitt," (cf. Native Tribes, pp. 494 if., 526, 528, 543). Lang was by now well aware of the fact that most of the oldest authors were suspected either of an imperfect scientific train- ing or of a religious bias. Thus he acknowledges that James Manning, although "he began his researches about 1833-34, when missionaries had not arrived, Melbourne did not exist and there 17 Andrew Lang, "Australian Gods: A Reply," Folk-lore, X (1899), 1-46; see p. 14. 18 E. S. Hartland, "Australian Gods: Rejoinder," Folk-lore, X (1899), 46-57; see p. 50. The Lang-Hartland controversy was laboriously analyzed by Schmidt in Ursprung (I, 273-311) in the enormous chapter "Die Kritik der Theorie Langs" (pp. 211-487), which follows the chapter devoted to "Der monotheistic Praani- mismus A. Langs" (pp. 134-210). Another discussion of Lang's ideas is to be found in Raffaelle Pettazzoni, Dio. Formazione e sviluppo del monoteismo nella storia delle religioni (Rome, 1922), I, 43-50. See below, n. 33. 19 Andrew Lang, "God (Primitive and Savage)," in J. Hastings (ed.), Encyclo- paedia of Religion and Ethics, VI (Edinburgh, 1913), 243-47. In this article Lang uses many examples already quoted in his discussion with Hartland. 20 J. G. Frazer, Totemism and Exogamy, I (London, 1910), 148. 114</page><page sequence="8">were no churches near his station," erred in representing Baiame and Grogorally too closely "to the Father and Son of Christian doctrine." But he points out that Manning's account was corro- borated by Mrs. Langloh Parker, in her book The Euahlayi Tribe (London, 1905). And he stresses the fact that a benevolent and creative being was attested "in 1833, 1855 and 1889-95 by three witnesses, all very intimate with the Kamilaroi and Euahlay tribes," and that their information precedes by many years the appearance of missionaries.21 Likewise, Andrew Lang shows that A. L. P. Cameron, our chief informant on the "nations" of Itchumundi, Karamundi, and Bar- kingi and the author of a long description of the All-Father of these tribes,22 cannot be easily dismissed: indeed, he was accepted by Frazer as an authority for the totemic institutions of these tribes (cf. Totemism and Exogamy, I, 380-87). Again, Lang reproaches Frazer (ibid., p. 151) for quoting the opinion expressed by E. M. Curr in The Australian Race (I [London, 1886-87], 45) that the aborigines dress up what they have learned from missionaries "with a view to please and surprise the whites," without informing his readers that Howitt (Native Tribes, pp. 503-506) had "replied and crushed Curr." Indeed, Howitt had shown that the Kurnai were not exposed to missionary propaganda. To the contrary, Lang continues, "where missions have long settled, as among the Dieiri and the Southern Arunta, not the farthest ray of Gospel light was discovered by Spencer and Gillen among the Arunta, or by Howitt or his informants among the Dieiri. Howitt found only a daemon named Brewin among the Kurnai (see Kamilaroi and Kurnai [Melbourne, 1881]) till he was initiated into their esoteric rites and doctrines." 23 Finally, Lang discusses Howitt's own ideas concerning the All- Fathers. He reminds us that in 1881, while still uninitiated, Howitt knew nothing of this belief. In 1884-85 he wrote copiously and with some enthusiasm about it in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute. He then spoke of the being as "the Supreme Spirit, who appears to me to represent the defunct head- man." In 1904 Howitt [Native Tribes, p. 503] renounced the idea that the All-Father is a spirit, but still regarded him as an idealization of a tribal "head-man," who had created the world or most of it, among 21 On Manning and Mrs. Parker, see also Lang, "Australian Gods," pp. 26 ff., 28 ff. A fresh analysis of their information was undertaken by Schmidt, Ursprung, I, 151-52 (Manning), 304 ff., 358 ff. (Mrs. Parker). 22 A. L. P. Cameron, "Notes on Some Tribes of New South Wales," JAI, XIV (1885), 351 ff. 23 Lang, "God (Primitive and Savage)," p. 245a. 115</page><page sequence="9">Australian Religions: An Introduction other wonderful works, and whose very name was tabued among men on earth except on the most sacred occasions. He "can go anywhere and do anything." In the same work Howitt rather watered down his ex- pressions of 1884-85 [Lang, "God (Primitive and Savage)," p. 245a]. Howitt was convinced that the belief in the All-Fathers "was a concomitant of social advance on the coast and in well-watered countries." But Lang reminds Howitt that "he had recorded the belief among tribes with the simplest and most archaic social or- ganization ... and among tribes as far removed from the sea and in conditions as unfavorable as the peoples of the Darling River and its hinterland"(ibid.). And Spencer and F. J. Gillen had dis- covered the High Being Atnatu among the Kaitish tribe, in the arid and infertile center of Australia. On the contrary, no All-Father belief was identified by Spencer and Gillen among the Arunta, with their highly advanced social organization (but see below, pp. 126 ff. Andrew Lang quotes the lines in which Howitt admits that the All-Father "is evidently everlasting, for he existed from the be- ginning of all things, and he still lives. But in being so, he is merely in that state in which, these aborigines believe, everyone would be if not prematurely killed by magic" (Native Tribes, p. 503). But, Lang comments, only men can be killed, and not the All-Father, who existed before death entered the world. "In this being," con- tinues Howitt, "although supernatural, there is no trace of a divine nature" (ibid.)-words that surprise Lang: No trace of a divine nature, he exclaims, "in a benevolent and everlasting creator, in several cases the dispenser of reward and penalty in the future life!" Howitt concludes that "it cannot be alleged that these aborigines have consciously any form of religion," because no sacrifice is offered and (except in very rare cases) no prayer is add- ressed to the All-Father. And again Lang ironically reminds Howitt that he himself had discovered and described the worship of Daramulun.24 FROM "MEN WITHOUT RELIGION" TO URMONOTHEISMUS This controversy on the nature and structure of the Australian High Gods was entangled in a series of prejudices. The "evolu- tionist" scholars (Spencer, Frazer, Hartland, etc.) were convinced 24 In the last section of this article (ibid.) Lang discusses the beliefs of the Arunta and Dieiri tribes, and especially their alcheringa heroes and mura-mura, who live in the sky and are called upon by the Dieiri for rain; for Lang this is a form of religion, because it implies prayers to a supernatural power. 116</page><page sequence="10">of the impossibility of a genuinely high religious conception among the Australian aborigines, for they were convinced of the abori- gines' mental and spiritual inferiority. They found it impossible to believe that a "stone-age" man was capable of elaborating such a complex and "noble" figure as that of a Creator, an omniscient and ethical All-Father. This type of divine figure was expected only at the apex of the religious evolution, not at an early stage. As Hartland puts it: "As little ... as the Australian theology do the precepts taught in the Australian mysteries, when carefully ex- amined, yield evidence of anything higher than the state of savagery in which the natives are found." 25 Moreover, there was also, at least unconsciously, an implicit conviction of the religious, or "scientific," justification for the white man's conquest of the black fellow's continent. But similar, if not so gross, prejudices were at work among the other party. Andrew Lang and his enthusiastic follower, Pater Wilhelm Schmidt, were equally "rationalists," though of another type. Lang thought that mythical creativity was somehow a sign of degeneration. Because he had discovered very few myths asso- ciated with the Australian All-Fathers, he thought that myth was secondary and ultimately disruptive of the highly ethical religious values. "Among the lowest known tribes we usually find, just as in Ancient Greece, the belief in a deathless 'Father,' 'Master,' 'Maker,' and also the crowd of humorous, obscene, fanciful myths which are in flagrant contradiction with the religious character of that belief. That belief is what we call rational, and even elevated. The myths, on the other hand, are what we call irrational and de- basing." And he adds: "The religious conception uprises from the human intellect, in one mood, that of earnest contemplation and submission; while the mythical ideas uprise from another mood, that of playful and erratic fancy." 26 Now it is a characteristically and inveterately Western and rationalistic approach to separate "myth" from "religion" and to proclaim that this separation of "irrational" from "rational" ele- ments can be justified by historical research: "in the beginning" archaic man disposed of a very simple, rational, and ethical "re- ligion"; then the "playful and erratic fancy" intervened and spoiled everything. But fortunately a "good religion" can always reverse the process and purify itself by Entmythologisierung. As a matter of fact, the myth is the ground of religion. And nowhere 25 "The 'High Gods' of Australia," p. 328. 26 Lang, Myth, Ritual and Religion, I (London, 1901), 4-5. 117</page><page sequence="11">Australian Religions: An Introduction else is this situation more clearly illustrated than in Australia: we always find the myth at the beginning of religion-of any type of re- ligion. It is true that the "All-Fathers" or Sky Beings have fewer myths than other Supernatural Beings, but this fact-which is attested throughout the entire history of religion-has another ex- planation than the "secondary character" of myth postulated by Lang. While Andrew Lang was writing his last article on the High Gods, Wilhelm Schmidt was completing the first volume of his monumental Ursprung der Gottesidee.27 By that time he had already acquired the prestige of a great linguist and ethnologist, and he had published an imposing number of books and monographs. He spared no pains in reading, analyzing, criticizing, and interpreting all the available materials on the Australian High Gods, with a view toward substantiating, correcting, and systematizing the ideas of Andrew Lang. He thought that he would be able to explain certain contradictions in the data-and particularly the coexistence of "mythical" or "degraded" elements with the more elevated con- ceptions of the High Gods-in terms of various crosses between the High God beliefs and later religious creations. He applied the method of historical ethnology that had been elaborated by Fritz Graebner for the purpose of identifying different cultural and re- ligious strata. A few years later Schmidt published in the third volume of Ursprung der Gottesidee a systematic presentation of the religious beliefs and customs of the southeastern Australians, covering almost six hundred pages.28 In his old age Wilhelm Schmidt complained that almost no one had read this exhaustive monograph and that very few scholars had made use of his meticulous analysis and elaborate system of cultural stratification. This is true. And, unfortunately, it is true not only with regard to the first and third volumes of Ursprung der Gottesidee but also the other nine volumes. (The twelfth and last volume was published posthumously in 1955). The neglect of such a monument of learning-twelve thousand pages consecrated to the idea of God among the most archaic peoples!-is due to many 27 The work first appeared in French, between 1908 and 1910, in Anthropos, the new journal founded by Schmidt. The reprint also was circulated separately under the title L'Origine de l'ide de Dieu. Etude historico-critique et positive. Premiere partie: Historico-critique (Vienna, 1910; 316 pp. in 4?). The German text was pub- lished in 1912 (xxiv+510 pp. in 8?), and a second, enlarged, edition appeared in 1926 (xl+ 832 pp.). 28 Ursprung, III, the Australian materials, pp. 565-1114. Schmidt once again examines the southeastern Australian religious beliefs in Vol. VI of his Ursprung, entitled Endsynthese der Religionen der Urvolker Amerikas, Asiens, Australiens, Afrikas (Miinster, 1935, lii + 593 pp); see s.v. "Australier." 118</page><page sequence="12">causes, some of them decidedly unworthy of the work. (A great many ethnologists and historians of religion found it impossible to believe that a Roman Catholic priest would be able to write "ob- jectively" about primitive religion; 29 others simply refused to read so many thousands of pages by the same author; others did not read German). But there are also more serious factors that help to explain the negligible impact of Ursprung der Gottesidee on con- temporary scholarship. One is the author's rigid and excessive rationalism, his conviction not only that an Urmonotheismus exist- ed but that he could prove its existence with the help of historical ethnology. Even more than Lang, Schmidt had attempted to identify Western conceptions of divinity among the "primitives." What he called Urmonotheismus was not merely the belief of the most archaic populations in One creative, omniscient, and omni- potent God; it was also an awareness of the idea of a Supreme Being, without myths and devoid of any anthropomorphic traits and weaknesses. Pater Schmidt asserted that the idea of the Supreme Being belongs to a religious stage preceding any mytho- logical formulation.30 But such an assumption is in contradiction to everything that we know of homo religiosus in general and of primitive man in particular. A Supreme Being is always a primor- dial and creative Being, and "primordiality" and "creativity" are mythical thought structures par excellence. If, almost everywhere in the world, the mythologies of the Supreme Beings are not as rich as the mythologies of the other species of divine figures, it is not because such Supreme Beings belong to a premythological epoch but simply because their activity is somehow exhausted in the works that they do in the beginning. They are said to have created or shaped the world and man, to have founded the principal social institutions, and to have proclaimed the moral laws. Now, the story of this type of creation is rather simple and may appear monotonous in comparison with the more dramatic mythologies of other divine beings whose works and adventures took place after the cosmogonic period had come to an end (although, of course, these latter works and adventures were also represented as having taken place in the primordial, mythical time). To give only one example: the fact that Bunjil, the Supreme 29 Against this view, see the critical-but sympathetic-appraisal of Schmidt's work by Robert H.

But Schmidt repeated this view time and time again in his writings. 119</page><page sequence="13">Australian Religions: An Introduction Being of the Kulin, is represented in his myths as having a brother, sons, daughters, and one or sometimes even two wives constitutes, for Schmidt, evidence that we are not in this instance being con- fronted with the original Bunjil; we are dealing with the result of a series of cross-fertilizations from later cultural strata, each of them associated with a different type of mythology. According to Schmidt, Bunjil's brother reflects the influence of the lunar my- thology characteristic of the Zweiklassenkulturen; his wives and children are the result of the crossing of lunar and solar mytho- logies characteristic of the Mischkulturen.31 What is implied here is, of course, the assumption that contact with "mythological thinking" (i.e., the lunar and solar mytholo- gies) and with alien social structures (e.g., the Zweiklassenkultur) inevitably must produce a deterioration in the original representa- tion of the Supreme Being. But the very notion of the deteriora- tion of a noble and spiritual Figure because of his implication in "human" contradictions and behavior is an "enlightened" Western idea. In a great many archaic and traditional cultures ("primitive" cultures, the Ancient Near East, India, etc.) "human" extravagances do not discredit the transcendental prestige of a deity. Furthermore, Schmidt's analysis of Bunjil's various "strata" is only a hypothetical reconstruction; it is not the description of a historical process; and it is certainly not the kind of hermeneutical work expected from a historian of religion. The historian of religion would have been expected to provide not only a hypothetical re- construction of Bunjil (the passage from the "pure" Supreme Being to the Bunjil with the brother, wives, and children) but an interpretation of these religious changes-provided, of course, that such changes could be substantiated. The "anthropomorphic figuration" of a High Being does not necessarily imply the degenera- tion of an antecedent and elevated figure. It rather represents a modification of the means of expression, a new "incarnation" of a religious idea. Similarly, a theriomorphic divinity is not necessarily an inferior or a poorer religious form than an anthropomorphic one. Animals lost their numinous aura only late in the history of religions. For hundreds of thousands of years the animal forms were the expression par excellence of transcendent and sacral powers. In sum, Wilhelm Schmidt was correct in trying to uncover and explain the historical changes in Australian religion; but his negative appraisal of these changes was an extrapolation, the pro- duct of his Western presuppositions. 31 See Ursprung, I, 342 ff., 371 ff.; III, 674-75; etc. 120</page><page sequence="14">AUSTRALIAN HIGH GODS AND THE WESTERN ZEITGEIST But whatever might have been the limitations of Andrew Lang, Wilhelm Schmidt, and their respective followers, at least they have the merit of having studied an important aspect of primitive re- ligions in general and of Australian religions in particular. The conception of a High Being-no matter how different this High Being might have been from the Supreme Beings attested in other, more complex cultures-was at least something which a great number of religions could be said to have in common. The distance between "primitives" and "civilized" man did not appear as an unbridgeable gap. But very soon after the publication of Lang's last article and the first volume of Ursprung der Gottesidee, the Western Zeitgeist changed, and the interest in the problem of High Gods faded out. Emile Durkheim's Lesformes elementaires de la vie religieuse (1912), Sigmund Freud's Totem und Tabu (1913), Lucien Levy-Bruhl's Les fonctions mentales dans les societes in- ferieures (1910) reoriented the attention of sociologists, psycholo- gists, historians of religion, and cultivated readers toward totemism-particularly Australian totemism-and toward what Levy-Bruhl called la mentalite prelogique. We need not enter into an elaborate discussion of their respective theses and hypotheses here.32 What is significant for our present discussion is the fact that, even though ethnologists have repeatedly criticized and rejected these hypotheses, the Zeitgeist of the post-World War I period seized upon Australian totemism as a central problem, significant not 32 See M. Eliade, "The History of Religions in Retrospect: 1912-1962," Journal of Bible and Religion, XXX (1963), 98-109, esp. 99 ff. For Emile Durkheim, the Australian High Gods are dependent upon the system of totemic beliefs. Baiame, Daramulun, Bunjil, and others seem to have been phratry totems that have been deified. According to Durkheim, this apotheosis took place through the initiation ceremonies; see The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, trans. Joseph Ward Swain (1915; reprint, New York: Collier Books, 1961), pp. 329 ff. One must dis- tinguish between Durkheim's pertinent analyses of certain aspects of Australian and other archaic religions, which are extremely valuable, and his general theory of the social origin of religion. This theory has been criticized and rejected by a majority of scholars. But the popular success of Durkheim's chef d'oeuvre is due primarily to his identification of religious experience with collective enthusiasm. This means, ultimately, that The Elementary Forms is more important for our un- derstanding of Western mentality than for our appraisal of primitive religion. Durkheim's popularity foretold what was to break out in most Western societies within the next ten to fifteen years. As a matter of fact, The Elementary Forms prepared the Western reader to understand the forthcoming events of the first European war, the rise of nationalism, and the appearance of fascism and com- munism. In an individualistic and agnostic anticlerical France, Durkheim em- phasized the religious nature of collective interests and enthusiasm. He prepared his readers to understand how the state, the social class, or the nation can become tremendous hierophanies. 2-H.O.R. 121</page><page sequence="15">Australian Religions: An Introduction only for the origin of religion but for the origins of society and culture-and even of Western man's neuroses. The few but important works published after 1920 in which the Australian High Gods were competently discussed passed almost unnoticed. We have seen the fate of the first volumes of Schmidt's Ursprung der Gottesidee. In 1922 Raffaele Pettazzoni brought out the first volume of his Dio. Formazione e sviluppo del monoteismo nella storia delle religion, subtitled L'Essere celeste nelle credenze dei popoli primitivi. He devoted a short but substantial chapter to the Australian High Gods and also discussed at length the ideas of Lang, Howitt, Schmidt, A. van Gennep, and other scholars. Pettazzoni, who had read Vico and who recognized the significance of mythical thought, rejected almost all of the previous interpreta- tions.33 He did not doubt the authenticity of the Australian High Gods-not only because he had read all the important primary sources but also because he understood the figure of the High God as a product of mythical imagination. For Pettazzoni, the Austra- lian (and other archaic) Supreme Beings are celestial gods; but ultimately they are mythical personifications of the sky and of the atmospheric phenomena (thunder, rain, rainbow, etc.) Other scholars,34 and even Schmidt, had described some of the Australian Supreme Beings as celestial gods.35 But Pettazoni insisted that a Sky Being has a naturistic structure mythically perceived: he not only lives in the sky but his activity is the activity of the sky.36 As was to be expected, Schmidt criticized this interpretation sharply and repeatedly.37 His main objection was that the High God, being conceived as a person, could neither be derived from nor identified with, the sky. The discussion between the two scholars went on for the rest of their lives.38 In one of his last 33 See Pettazzoni, op. cit., I, 43 ff. (Lang, Schmidt), 60 ff. (a critical discussion of A. van Gennep's Mythes et lIgendes d'Australie [Paris, 1906]). Van Gennep thought that the Australian high gods are naturistic deities or, more precisely, thunder gods (dieux-tonnerre); see ibid., Introduction, p. cxvi. 34 E.g., Frobenius, Im Zeitalter des Sonnesgottes (Berlin, 1904), I, 73 ff., on Baiame; W. Foy; Th. Preuss; Graebner; etc. (see Pettazzoni, op. cit., I, 64 ff.). 35 But Schmidt denied that this implies a personification of the sky; see below, n. 37. 36 See Pettazzoni, op. cit., I, 67 ff., 355 ff., etc. Pettazzoni never published his projected second and third volumes of Dio, to be devoted to the "Supreme God in the Polytheistic Religions" and to the "Unique God in the Monotheistic Religions" (I, p. xvi). But in 1955 he brought out an imposing monograph, L'Onniscienza di Dio (Torino); on Australian High Gods, see pp. 507-12. 37 See, e.g., Schmidt's Ursprung, I, 270-73, 674-90; Anthropos, XXI (1926), 269-72; and The Origin and Growth of Religion, trans. H. J. Rose (New York, 1931), pp. 209-14. 38 See, e.g., R. Pettazzoni, "Monoteismo e 'Urmonoteismo' " (Studi e materiali di storia delle religioni, XIX-XX [1943-46], 170-77) and "Das Ende des Urmono- theismus?" (Numen, III [1956], 156-59; Numen, V [1958], 161-63). 122</page><page sequence="16">articles, Pettazzoni recognized that he was "now in partial agree- ment with Fr. Wilhelm Schmidt as to the non-reducibility of the Supreme Being to the Celestial Being." Nonetheless, he adds that he is still of the opinion that the Supreme Being "is not mainly the product of logico-causal thought, as Schmidt holds, but rather that this notion is the product of mythical thought." 39 But it is only necessary for us to read Pettazzoni's most recent works to see that he outgrew the main thesis of L'Essere celeste, namely, that the primitive Supreme Beings are "personifications" of the sky. Pettazzoni's ideas were known and discussed only among a limited number of scholars. Probably a larger audience was acquainted with Graebner's last book, Das Weltbild der Primitiven, where the founder of historical ethnology summarizes his views on the Australian All-Father. About this "great creative God," Graebner writes: Generally there exists beside him another figure, powerful but sub- ordinate, most frequently considered to be his son, but often as the primeval ancestor of mankind. Sometimes, for instance among the Kurnai, the great god has no wife, or only an invisible one; occasionally he has produced his son without having a consort. His principal attri- bute is that of creator, or first cause of, at least, everything which is important for men; he is the first maker of the most important imple- ments, as the boomerang; he is a magician whose power knows no bounds; he is the celestial chief. Knowledge of him is imparted to the youths at their initiation, when they are received into the status of men; it is given them by the elders.... It is moreover very important that the great god is considered not only as creator and maker of all things, but also as guardian of the tribal morality. It is of him that the legend is told how in the old days, when men had forgotten their good habits, he sent the conflagration and the flood to punish them.... As regards the nature and meaning of the great god, it must first be said that his exist- ence completely satisfies the lively desire of the natives to know the cause of things. But Preuss is perhaps right in doubting that so abstract an idea as the first cause could have been capable, among primitive men, of producing a figure which is always so full of life. The god is of course also supposed to be the originator of the rites and magical practices by which man rules nature; and to this extent his existence ensures the continuance of the human race even now.... His pre-eminent signific- ance and the vividness with which he has been developed are due, in this ancient culture, to another factor still, I mean the ethics. This god is the preserver, not only of the psychical, but above all of the social existence of man, and thus of his very essence." 40 39 R.

Graebner published a 123</page><page sequence="17">Australian Religions: An Introduction HIGH GODS AND CULTURE HEROES Graebner's account may be considered the last authoritative and positive account of the southeast Australian High Gods. By the be- ginning of this century, these tribes had lost their cultural auto- nomy, or even disappeared physically, and new research became almost impossible. On the other hand, the new generation of ethnologists has tended to regard the observations of earlier writers with some suspicion. For example, in their great syntheti- cal work The World of the First Australians, Ronald and Catherine Berndt seem to doubt even Howitt, who "went so far as to speak of an 'All Father.' " 41 The fact that in "most of southern Australia today it is no longer possible to check on such material" (The World of the First Australians, p. 202) has obliged the Berndts to let the religious beliefs of these populations pass almost unnoticed. In 1943, at Menindee, they were unable to obtain an articulate Baiame myth. "He was still well known, but allusions to him were mainly in the context of initiation and magic, and to his appear- ance during certain rites" (ibid.). Even in an acculturated society, the secret cult of a High Being would seem to be the most resist- ant! 42 We must add that what, in the first quarter of the century, was called "All-Father," "High God," or "Supreme Being" is now being called, by some Australian ethnologists, "ancestral hero," "culture hero," 43 or "sky hero" and "sky culture hero" (Elkin). A. P. Elkin does not seem to be as skeptical as the Berndts in re- gard to the earlier information about the Supreme Beings of south- series of articles, "Zur australischen Religionsgeschichte," in Globus, 96 (1909), 341 ff., 362 ff., 373 ff., in which he attempted to establish the chronology of the three distinct cultural areas that he had previously discovered. Graebner's re- search and his results, for obvious reasons, were ignored by Durkheim. See also Rudolph F. Lehmann, "Die Religionen Australiens und der Siidsee, 1911-1930," Archiv fur Religionswissenschaft, XXIX (1931), 139-86. 41 R. M. and C. H. Berndt, The World of the First Australians (Chicago, 1964), p. 202. Although Schmidt's Ursprung is quoted in the bibliography, the authors do not discuss his ideas on Australian religion. 42 From an old man, now dead-the last of his people to be initiated-the Berndts collected a rather complete myth of Ngurunderi (of the lower Murray River in South Australia). The authors call Ngurunderi an "ancestral hero." He behaves like one; his myths consist of a series of travels and adventures, during which he shaped the land and performed some metamorphoses. "Finally he dived into the sea to cleanse himself of his old life and went up into the sky: Waieruwar, the spirit world. But before disappearing, he told the Jaraldi people that the spirits of their dead would always follow the tracks he had made, and eventually join him in the sky-world" (ibid., p. 204). This last detail is important. Ngurunderi seems to represent a sky hero who preserved some traits of a celestial High Being. 43 See R. M. and C. H. Berndt, ibid., p. 141, with reference to Baiame and Daramulun. 124</page><page sequence="18">east Australia. In speaking of Baiame, Daramulun, Nurunderi, Bunjil, etc., he asserts that they "bestowed on men their various items of material culture, gave them social laws, and above all, in- stituted the initiating rites. It is in the latter that the initiates first gain any real knowledge of him, and learn his secret name; even to- day civilized Aborigines will not breathe that name to the out- sider." 44 But Elkin calls Baiame, Daramulun, and the others "sky heroes." They see and know everything and live in the sky, "a place often pictured as possessing much quartz, crystal and fresh water." During his initiation the medicine man "can visit this sky land and see something of Baiame; and finally, the departed go there as they are entitled to do by reason of their initiation" (Aborigines, p. 224). The sky hero, Elkin continues, usually was re- ferred to by the aborigines as "father" or "all-father," the bull- roarer was his symbol, and "he was and is the sanction for essential laws, customs and rites" (ibid., p. 225). One can readily see that Elkin's presentation of the south Australian sky hero corresponds almost exactly to Howitt's and Lang's description of the "All-Father" and to Graebner's "great god." Most probably the eminent ethnologist hesitated to use these terms because of their ideological, and even theological con- notations. As a matter of fact, Elkin's "sky hero" is a real god-in his opinion, a mystery-religion type of god: "As far as I can see the matter, and I have discussed it with initiates, this sky-hero corre- sponds to the hero of religious secret societies, the mysteries of which go back to the old mystery cults of a few thousand years ago, and with which I am prepared to believe that this cult is historic- ally connected, by whatever incidents it was brought to the Australians" (ibid., p. 244). We shall not discuss here Elkin's hypothesis of the historical connection between the mystery cults and the Australian initia- tion.45 What is important for our endeavor is (1) that Elkin does not doubt the authenticity of the southeast Australian Sky Beings and (2) that he considers them to precede the totemic Heroes chronologically. Indeed, he writes: Initiation and the secret life spread all over Australia and though now in central and northern parts of Australia, the belief in the sky-hero of initiation has either ceased to exist or else has been pushed into the 44 A. P. Elkin, The Australian Aborigines (hereinafter cited as "Aborigines") (1938; 3d ed, 1954; reprint, New York: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1964), p. 224. 45 So far as I know, Elkin has never made explicit what he meant by "the old mystery cults of a few thousand years ago." Eleusis? Hellenistic mystery religions? But at the center of such mystery cults were "dying and rising gods," not "sky 125</page><page sequence="19">Australian Religions: An Introduction background by the totemic heroes whose spirits are tied to the earth, yet a careful survey of the evidence suggests that initiation there, too, was possibly, in former days, a means of gaining knowledge of the sky- hero and access to his world. In the north-west, the heroes who taught the natives how to make the bull-roarer, and who introduced initiation ceremonies, belong to the sky. In an important and widespread Central Australian myth concerning incompletely formed beings, which I think refers to an initiation rite performed on candidates, the hero and operator came from the sky.46 Other central Australian myths seem to illustrate the same onto- logical and chronological sequence: Sky Beings-totemic Heroes. Already in 1904 Spencer and Gillen had described Atnatu, the Primordial Being of the Kaitish tribe (in central Australia, just north of the Aranda), as preceding the alcheringa times, that is, the epoch of the "creation." Atnatu "arose up in the sky in the very far back-past ... He made himself and gave himself a name." He has wives and sons, the sons also being named Atnatu. Because certain of his sons neglected his sacred services, he expelled them from the sky. These sons came down to earth and became the an- cestors of men. Atnatu sent to men "everything which the black fellow has." He is described as "a very great man, black," conducts sacred services in which the bull-roarers swing, and punishes those mortals who do not sound the bull-roarers at the initiation cere- monies.47 heroes." Perhaps he was thinking of Mithra, the only mystery god who does not know death; but Mithra cannot be classified among the "sky heroes" either. In his book Aboriginal Men of High Degree (Sydney, 1946), pp. 76-77, Elkin points out the similarities between the parapsychological powers of the Australian medicine man and the feats of the Indian and Tibetan yogis. He is inclined to accept a his- torical connection between them (see Eliade, Birth and Rebirth, pp. 99 ff.). We shall return to this problem later. For the moment, let us add that there are also similarities between the medical ideas and practices of the Australian medicine men and those of the aboriginal tribes of India; see E. Drobec, "Heilkunde bei den Eingeborenen Australien," Wiener Beitrdge zur Kulturgeschichte und Linguistik, IX (1952), 280-307; see p. 305. But such similarities do not imply an influence from the Indian or Tibetan yogis. Elkin also compares the initiatory pattern of the Australian medicine man to a mummification ritual attested in eastern Australia, which might represent a Melanesian influence (Aboriginal Men of High Degree, pp. 40-41). But Elkin is inclined to believe that Melanesian influences were bearers of ideas and techniques that had originated in higher cultures. Is Elkin connecting the initiation of the Australian medicine man with the Egyptian ritual of mummi- fication? Such hypotheses would remind one of the "Egyptian diffusionism" of G. Elliot-Smith and W. J. Perry. In any case, it is an unwarranted hypothesis: the same pattern of initiation is to be found among the Siberians and North and South American shamans; see M. Eliade, Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy (New York, 1964). 46 Elkin, Aborigines, p. 224. 47 B. Spencer and F. J. Gillen, The Northern Tribes of Central Australia (London, 1904), pp. 498 ff. Elkin, Aborigines, p. 225, rightly observes that these are the prototype of the rites performed on earth. 126</page><page sequence="20">"Amongst the western Aranda and Loritja," Elkin writes, "the dream-time heroes are said in some myths to have had formerly associations with the sky-world and access to it by way of a moun- tain. The sky-hero, however, caused this to sink and so the dream- time totemic heroes had to. remain on earth."48 This mythical tradition is important and deserves to be analyzed more closely. We shall utilize primarily the new information recently published by T. G. H. Strehlow.49 According to this author, it was believed in the Aranda-speaking areas that the earth and the sky had al- ways existed and had always been the home of Supernatural Beings. The western Aranda believe that the sky is inhabited by an emu-footed Great Father (Knaritja), who is also the Eternal Youth (altjira nditja). He has dog-footed wives and many sons and daughters. "They lived on fruits and vegetable foods in an etern- ally green land, unaffected by droughts, through which the Milky Way flowed like a broad river; and the stars were their campfires. In this green land there were only trees, fruits, flowers, and birds; no game animal existed, and no meat was eaten. All of these sky dwellers were as ageless as the stars themselves, and death could not enter their home." 50 The "reddish-skinned" Great Father of the sky is in appearance as young as his children.51 Strehlow then 48 Elkin, Aborigines, p. 225. 49 T.

Jensen, II (Munich, 1964), 723-54; see also his Aranda Traditions (Melbourne, 1947) and "La gemellit6 de l'ame humaine," La Tour Saint-Jacques (Paris, 1957), No. 11-12 (Numero special sur la magie), pp. 14-23. Most of this information is already given, in a more condensed form, in C. Strehlow's works; see n. 51. But we prefer to follow T. G. H. Strehlow's presentation, if only for the fact that his first language was Aranda. 50 T. G. H. Strehlow, "Personal Monototemism," p. 725. 51 C. Strehlow found similar beliefs among the Kukatja (whom he calls "western Loritja") and Matuntara (whom he calls "southern Loritja"); they spoke of a Sky Being with a wife and a small child. Gillen, too, reported that among the eastern Aranda group of Alice Springs "the sky is said to be inhabited by three persons- a gigantic man with an immense foot shaped like that of the emu, a woman, and a child who never develops beyond childhood" (quoted by T. G. H. Strehlow, "Per- sonal Monototemism," p. 725). We do not have to take up the long discussion that followed C. Strehlow's discovery of the Sky Being Altjira among the Aranda and of Tukura among the Loritja; see C. Strehlow and M. von Leonhardi, Mythen, Sagen und Mdrchen des Aranda-Stammes in Zentral-Australien, Vols. I-IV (Frank- furt a.M.: Veroffentlichungen aus dem stadtischen Volker-Museum, 1907-20). Spencer denied that there were such gods; he insisted that the Aranda spoke only of alcheringa, i.e., of the mythical or "Dream Time." But it was soon realized that both affirmations were fundamentally correct and did not contradict each other (in spite of Spencer's refusal to accept the existence of an Aranda Sky Being). As a matter of fact, C. Strehlow's Altjira is par excellence the being of the primordial, mythical "Dream Time," alcheringa. One can only regret Spencer's malicious statement that C. Strehlow's material "had to be obtained orally from some of the old men who were Christianized members of the Mission" (The Arunta: A Study of a Stone Age People, Vol. I [London, 1927], Preface, p. ix). T. G. H. Strehlow rightly 127</page><page sequence="21">Australian Religions: An Introduction goes on: "Although I have not recorded any traditions about emu- footed or dog-footed sky dwellers outside the Western Aranda territory, it is nevertheless true that everywhere in the Aranda- speaking area a firm belief was held that the power of death was limited to the earth, and that men had to die only because all con- nections had been severed between the sky and the earth." Strehlow reminds us that traditions about broken "ladders" have been found at many ceremonial sites. Among the lower southern Aranda there is a myth of a gigantic casuarina tree which, at the beginning of time, stood at a sacred site in the Simpson Desert and touched the sky with its topmost branches. A few miles away there was another casuarina tree which was ready to provide a suitable ladder for men to climb to the sky. But the tree was cut down by certain mythical personages, and the bridge between earth and sky was destroyed forever. There is also the myth of the two Ntji- kantja brothers, already related by Strehlow in his Aranda Traditions: after pulling up the spear on which they had climbed into the sky, the brothers uttered a death curse upon the earth dwellers.52 The Ntjikantja brothers, like the sun, the moon, and the stars, emerged from the earth and wandered about on its sur- face doing the same sort of works as the other earth-born totemic ancestors. But while the majority of the totemic ancestors finally returned into the ground, those who rose into the sky took on celestial bodies and knew neither decay nor death. The Ntjikantja brothers turned into the Magellanic Clouds.53 For Strehlow, "it is clear that it would be impossible to regard the emu-footed Great Father in the sky of Western Aranda mytho- logy as a supreme Being in any sense of the word; for neither he nor his family ever exerted any influence beyond the sky" ("Per- sonal Monototemism," p. 726). Indeed, these Sky Beings did not create or shape the sky; nor did they bring into existence either plants, animals, men, or the totemic ancestors; nor did they inspire or control any of the ancestors' activities. In sum, these Sky Beings points out that his father's primary western Aranda informant was an exception- ally intelligent medicine man born about 1846, "whose prestige as an authority on the beliefs extended far beyond the Western Aranda area" and who "remained an inflexible champion of the old order throughout the years of C. Strehlow's stay at Hermannsburg" ("Personal Monototemism," pp. 723-24, n. 1; see ibid., the bio- graphies of the other informants). 52 T. G. H. Strehlow, Aranda Traditions, p. 78. He gives the curse of the brothers: "You miserable death-doomed wretches, all of you must die now! You may never return from the earth while you are living, and you may never return after you are dead" (" Personal Monototemism," p. 726). 53 T. G. H. Strehlow, "Personal Monototemism," p. 726. 128</page><page sequence="22">were not even interested in what happened on the earth. The evil- doers had to fear not the Great Father of the sky but the wrath of the totemic ancestors and the punishment of the tribal authorities (ibid.). All of the creative and meaningful acts were effected by the earth-born totemic ancestors. For this reason the myths and re- ligious functions associated with these ancestors will detain us at length later on. From the perspective of History of Religions, the transformation of a Sky Being into a deus otiosus seems to have reached its farthest limits among the western Aranda. The next step could only be his falling into total and definitive oblivion. This probably did occur outside of the western Aranda territory, where Strehlow was not able to find any comparable beliefs in Sky Beings. But one can point out two characteristic traits even in this indifferent, otiose, and "transcendant" Great Father and Eternal Youth that range him among the Supreme Beings: (1) his immortality, his eternal youth, and his beatific existence; (2) his "ontological" and "chro- nological" precedence over the totemic heroes-he had been there in the sky for a long time before the emergence of the totemic an- cestors from under the earth. Moreover, the religious significance of the sky is repeatedly proclaimed in the myths of the celestial immortality of those heroes who were able to ascend into heaven, in the mythical traditions about "ladders" or trees connecting heaven and earth, and especially in the widespread Aranda belief that death came into being only because the communications between earth and heaven had been violently interrupted. As is well known, similar beliefs are attested in many other archaic religions. The myth of a primordial communication with Heaven (through a Mountain, Tree, Ladder, Liana, etc.) and its subsequent interruption is related to the Ancestor's loss of im- mortality or of his original paradisal situation. A celestial Supreme Being is usually implicated in these fateful events. After the break- ing of the communications between Heaven and Earth the God re- tires, becomes more or less a deus otiosus, and only a few privileged persons-shamans, medicine men, heroes-are able to ascend to heaven and meet him. Now, we do not know how much of this mythical theme was known to the Aranda. But the fact is that the religious prestige of heaven did continue to survive, particularly in the notion that immortality belongs to the celestial bodies and Sky Beings. Noting that in Kaitish mythology "the sky-being existed before this dream-time," Elkin surmises: "This possibly represents the 129</page><page sequence="23">Australian Religions: An Introduction historical sequence in that area and indeed in all the central, northern and north-western regions. Initiation was at first admis- sion to the beliefs and rites connected with the sky-hero, but later it included also admission into cult-totemism with its myths of the dream-time heroes, which in many tribes, as far as our knowledge goes, ultimately overshadowed the former belief and associa- tions." 54 This would imply that at one time the Sky Being beliefs were more widely diffused in Australia. Their disappearance or transformation follows the general pattern of the withdrawal of a celestial deus otiosus and his eventual and final oblivion. But what is important here is that the religious function of the Dream Time heroes (or totemic ancestors) becomes equivalent to that of the Sky Beings. As Elkin remarks: "Just as in central or north-western Australia, to say a custom is altjira, djugur, ungud, etc., that is, dreaming, is to give it final and unimpeachable authority, so in eastern Australia, to say of a custom, 'Baiame say so' is to provide the same kind of sanction. Finally, the myths in which the sky- hero figures, perform the same aetiological, historical, and socio- logical function as do those of the dream-time heroes, and through their representation in symbol and rite, entry is gained to the sacred, life-giving world-but this time it is in the sky." 55 DJAMAR, NOGAMAIN We shall return to this functional equivalence between the models revealed in the "dreaming period" and the injunction of the type "Baiame say so." For the moment, let us examine two other celestial Supreme Beings and their actual roles in the religious life of their respective tribes. The Bad, of the West Kimberley, revere a Supreme Being called Djamar. He has no father; but we do know the name of his mother. Djamar never married. It is said that he "walks with a dog."56 One of Worms' informants told him: "Djamar made all things ... He is living in the salt-water under a rock. Where the sea is bubbling there Djamar lives." 57 But this means only that Djamar's first bull-roarer (tjuringa, called by the Bad galaguru) is still there, under the foam of the breakers. The young initiates are led to the stony bed of the creek and are shown 54 Elkin, Aborigines, p. 225. 55 Ibid., pp. 225-26. Elkin specifies that "the two sets of beliefs co-existed not only in Central Australia but also on the north coast of New South Wales" (p. 226, n. 4). 56 E. A. Worms, "Djamar, the Creator," Anthropos, XLV (1950), 643-58; see p. 650. 57 Ibid., p. 655. 130</page><page sequence="24">the holes where Djamar had planted his bull-roarer. "Earnestly the old men impress on the youths the terrible force of the original tjuringa, by pointing out the baldness of the surrounding hills and the damaged bark of the trees struck by Djamar when he whirled the bull-roarer. It smashed the rocks of the foreshore" ("Djamar, the Creator," p. 643). After these events Djamar ascended to the sky, together with his tjuringa. From there "he watches the people and gives them the native law which we call Djamara-mara. He sees when a man kills another with a spear or boomerang" (ibid., p. 650). Nevertheless, despite his ascension, Djamar "remains in Ngamagun Creek, and in all places where his engraved galaguru are preserved. These are carefully hidden by the natives in hollow trees near the silent water pools of their tribal country" (ibid., p. 643). The myth of Djamar is revealed during the initiation cere- monies. On this occasion the old men go into the forest searching for the tree under which Djamar rested in the mythical times. (And once again we note how, through the ritual, the mythical time is reactualized and the original tree is made present.) From this tree the bull-roarers of the new initiates will be prepared.58 Djamar's nature as a High Being is also reflected in his relations to Culture Heroes. One of these Culture Heroes, Nalgabi, carried Djamar's galaguru to a neighboring tribe. Djamar walked with an- other Hero, Marel, to a certain place, where Marel remained and where he still lives. "Marel makes the secret songs, but for men only. He watches the young initiated men and teaches them the law of Djamar" (ibid., p. 650). Another Culture Hero, Minan, made dances and the smooth black stone axes. He now lives at a certain place in Beagle Bay. "Djamar orders Marel and Minan. He is their boss" (p. 650). Finally, another Hero, Ninj, was told by Djamar to make fish traps out of sticks and stones. "He got his job from Djamar." 59 Thus it would seem that Djamar can be compared to the south- eastern Supreme Beings: he is creator, he revealed the moral laws, he charged a certain number of Culture Heroes with the task of civilizing the Bad and supervising their religious ceremonies; finally he ascended to the sky, and from there he still watches men's be- havior. The only aspect of this complex that is not clearly attested 58 Ibid., pp. 650 ff. On the Bad initiation, see E. A. Worms, "Initiationsfeiern," Annali Lateranensi, II (1938), 179-80; idem, "Religiose Vorstellungen und Kultur einiger nordwestaustralischer Stamme in fiinfzig Legenden," Annali Lateranensi, Vol. IV (1940). 59 Worms, "Djamar the Creator," p. 650; see also E. A. Worms, "Djamar and His Relation to Other Culture Heroes," Anthropos, XLVII (1952), 539-560. 131</page><page sequence="25">Australian Religions: An Introduction among the southeastern High Gods is Djamar's relation to the tjuringa. Formally, this tjuringa is a "pictograph or metaphorical record on wood." Some of the incised marks represent Djamar him- self, others figure objects used by him, or lesser Supernatural Beings. Only an initiate can "read" the drawings correctly. But the galaguru is not only a symbol of Djamar; it is also a replica of the original bull-roarer that Djamar deposited under the rock of Ngamagun. Now, that original bullroarer also exists in the sky. This would seem to imply that Djamar is that original galaguru (see ibid., p. 650). The notion that a divine being is embodied in his tjuringa reminds us of the identification between the mythical Heroes (Ancestors) and specific tjuringa which is characteristic of the central Australian tribes-a conception we shall discuss later. For the moment it is important for us to emphasize the mystical plurality of Djamar's bodies. As Worms points out, "wherever to- day an authorized replica of this galaguru is carved, carried or stored, there Djamar and his original location of Ngamagun is occasioned again. There his personal presence is obtained, repeated and multiplied. 'We cannot carry that rock to this place. Therefore we make this djidi (i.e. tjuringa)-and Djamar is here,"' said one of Worms' informants.60 We can surmise that Djamar was able to conserve his religious actuality particularly because of the ritual importance of the gala- guru, which can be considered his "mystical body." The initiation consisted of the communication of Djamar's myths and the dis- closure of his identity both with the celestial galaguru and with the primordial one buried under the rock at Ngamagun. Our second example is taken from the Murinbata, a tribe of western Arnhem Land studied carefully and at great length by W. E. H. Stanner. The pattern of the Murinbata religious life is constituted by a series of events that took place in the "dreaming period." But there are also a number of "pure spirits" whose re- ligious prestige is independent of that prodigious mythical period. The most eminent among them is Nogamain, "a sky-dweller, who lived (according to some) 'of his own will' or 'in his own fashion'- and alone, except for a dog, with 'no father, no mother, no brother, no child'; but (according to others) with a wife and son, the son being symbolized by a hunting spear. It was supposed to be Nogamain's influence at work, through his son, if a hunter killed a kangaroo or wallaby with one throw of a spear." 61 According to 60 Worms, "Djamar, the Creator," p. 657. 61 W. E. H. Stanner, "On Aboriginal Religion, VI," Oceania, XXXIII (1963), 239-73; see p. 264 (also: Oceania Monograph No. 11, reprint, p. 162). 132</page><page sequence="26">Stanner, some people identified Nogamain with the man in the moon. Others were not so sure; when asked of his abode, they raised their arms toward the whole sky and said a single word: "on high." Thunder and lightning were attributed to "the people of Nogamain." He was also responsible for sending spirit children; Stanner heard many times: "Nogamain sends down good children." But he also received the same information about other "pure spirits." The most important cultic act was the prayer for food in case of distress; one of Stanner's oldest informants remembered that, as a child, he had heard the oldest men "calling out to Nogamain at night when they lay in camp short of food" ("On Aboriginal Religion," p. 264). In Nogimain we have a clear example of a celestial god in the process of being supplemented by other Figures (Kunmanggur and Kukpi also send the spirit children) and on the point of losing his religious actuality (only one of the oldest informants remembered, from his childhood, the prayer of the oldest men). The discre- pancies and contradictions between various descriptions of Nogi- main, as remarked by Stanner, are an indication of his progressive religious irrelevance. In comparison with the Great Father of the western Aranda, Nogamain still preserves a certain religious actuality: for example, he cares for men. But unlike Djamar-or, we can surmise, Atnatu of the Kaitish-he does not play any im- portant role in the initiation ceremonies. TWO KINDS OF "PRIMORDIALITY" But apparently the irrelevance, the vagueness, or the absence of a celestial High Being does not modify the pan-Australian pattern of the religious life. As Elkin puts it: to say that a custom is altjira, "dreaming," is the same as to say of a custom: "Baiame say so." Elkin rightly insists on the chronological anteriority of the Sky Beings as compared with the Culture (or Totemic) Heroes. As we know, the same opinion was held by Lang, Graebner, and Schmidt. But what is important in this process is that the religious function of the primordial and primordiality remains the same. Whatever the context may be-supernatural Sky Gods, Culture Heroes, Wondjina or Ungud (to be discussed in our next articles)-the primordial mythical time has an overwhelming significance. Only that which was effected in illo tempore is real, meaningful, exem- plary, and of inexhaustible creativity. Among the western Aranda we noted a passage from what might be called a "speculative" primordial time-the epoch of the celestial, eternal Great Father- 133</page><page sequence="27">Australian Religions: An Introduction to a primordial time rich in existential values, the fabulous epoch of the "dreaming" when the totemic ancestors (or Culture Heroes) shaped the world, created the animals, and completed and civilized man. The "primordiality" of the Great Father was not of im- mediate relevance to the Aranda's existence; once the communica- tion with heaven had been interrupted and death had come into the world, it was not very helpful to know about the immortality of Altjira's family or of those who had ascended to heaven. The only "immortality" accessible to the Aranda and to other Austra- lian tribes was the reincarnation, the perennial return to life of the primordial Ancestors-conceptions we shall take up in a future article. Thus it seems as if the pattern of Australian religions implies the substitution of a "primordial" directly related to the human con- dition for the "primordial" preceding this condition. Such a pro- cess is known in other religions too; we might refer, for example, to the "primordiality" of Tiamat and the passage to the creative pri- mordial epoch represented by the victory of Marduk, the cosmo- gony, anthropogony, and the founding of a new divine hierarchy. Or we might compare the primordiality of Ouranos with the esta- blishment of Zeus' supremacy-or point to the passage from the almost forgotten Dyaus to Varuna and later still to the consecutive supremacies of Indra, Shiva, and Vishnu.62 What is significant in this substitution of an "existential" primordiality for a "speculative" one is that this process represents a more radical incarnation of the sacred in life and human existence. We shall have an opportunity to illustrate this process when we examine the coming into being of the Aranda totemic Ancestors and the myths of the Australian Culture Heroes. The abundance of embryological imagery is not without a profound religious mean- ing. It is as if the entire grandiose cosmogonic drama were being interpreted in terms of procreation, pregnancy, embryonic exist- ence, and obstetric operations. But none of these fabulous events is either "human" or "profane" in nature. They are primordial, creative, exemplary, and thus religious acts. Ultimately they re- present mysteries which only the fully initiated men will be able to grasp. 62 See also the discussion of a similar problem by Charles H. Long, "The West African High God: History and Religious Experience," History of Religions, III (Winter, 1964), 328-42. [To be continued] 134</page></plain_text>
