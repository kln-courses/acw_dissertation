<plain_text><page sequence="1">203 TEXTS AND SCULPTURES FROM THE NORTH-WEST PALACE, NIMRUD By J. E. READE Over the last quarter century the North-West Palace of Ashurnasirpal II at Nimrud, which was once treated as a building of minor interest, has been the object of three large books and several scholarly articles. Much of this progress has been due to the work of the Iraq authorities who have re-excavated the state apartments and collaborated with the Polish scholars, Janusz Meuszyinski and Ryszard Sobolewski, in making detailed plans available for publication (Fig. I). One area in particular, which we now understand better, is the west wing of the state apartments. At the request of Meuszynski, I once promised to gather together what information I could find in London concerning the west wing and the sculptured panels found there, and this article is dedicated to his memory. It has taken a different form from that originally envisaged, as a study of the sculptured rooms not covered in Meuszyn'ski's own book (I98I) is now being prepared jointly by Sobolewski and Samuel Paley. What I present here is information derived from unpublished copies of cuneiform inscriptions, and some fresh evidence and observations relating mainly to Ashurnasirpal's narrative sculptures. The inscriptions are ones which were once built into the structure of the palace; they were recorded by the original excavator, A. H. Layard, in a notebook (Layard, Ms. A) which is now preserved in the Department of Western Asiatic Antiquities at the British Museum. Early history of the palace The history of the palace can be followed partly through textual references and partly through features of the structure itself. The two are closely linked because hundreds of stone slabs which panelled the palace walls were inscribed, but these inscriptions largely duplicate one another and have therefore been most inadequately published. A full analysis of the ways in which they vary among themselves would provide information on the government secretariat at Nimrud, but I am only concerned here with variants that give different indications of the limits of Ashurnasirpal's conquests and which can consequently be arranged, perhaps, in chronological order. It will emerge that the validity of this method of arrangement, adopted by several scholars but questioned by Schramm (I 973: 27-8), seems to be confirmed by the positions originally occupied by the inscriptions. Sources available (e.g. Weidner 1939; Paley 1976; de Filippi I977) are greatly supplemented by Layard's Ms. A copies, and I have checked the relevant geographi- cal names in these. For Layard, the value of the variants lay largely in the degree to which they might assist the basic decipherment of cuneiform, and he recorded many further texts in ways that seem to leave some doubt as to the readings at critical points; detailed study of the copies would extract more information, as I have not gone through them all comprehensively, but collation of original stones would obviously be preferable. The earliest reference to a royal palace at Nimrud occurs in a text probably written about 879-878 B.C. (Grayson 1976: 154). It has been fairly argued that this</page><page sequence="2">204 J. E.

One would have expected that the main royal palace would have been one of the projects having priority in the design of a new capital city such as Nimrud, but it did require massive mudbrick foundations. Trhe earliest texts certainly referring to the North-West Palace are some founda- tion tablets (Grayson I976:1I67-8, No. 14) which name Carchemish as the westernmost area conquered by Ashurnasirpal, though prisoners from Patina further west are mentioned too. No campaign that involves fighting against Carchemish is described in Ashurnasirpal's surviving annals, but its Hittite king, Sangara, appears as a prisoner, naked but for his hat, on a bronze gate relief (Barnett</page><page sequence="3">TEXTS AND SCULPTURES FROM THE NORTH-WEST PALACE, NIMRUD 205 I973: facing p. 22). If this is a different campaign from that in which Ashurnasirpal took hostages from Carchemish while passing by on his way to Lebanon, then the earliest available date for it is probably about 875, the latest about 868. As the tablets state, they were deposited within the walls of the palace, where examples of them or of later foundation tablets have indeed been found (Layard I849: 1, II 5; II, 9I). They describe the building, with its colossi and its suites of rooms of various woods, as if it were already complete. It has been thought that the Carchemish reference in this text was also present on some palace wall panels because it is included among the variants of the " Standard Inscription " listed by Layard (i 85 I: 5), but I can find no evidence for this among his manuscript copies. More probably Layard or his editor took the variant, not from a wall panel but from one of the foundation tablets, such as BM 90867, which was already in London. A briefer variety of foundation tablet text (Grayson 1976: i8i, No. 22) gives Lebanon and the Great Sea instead of Carchemish as the westernmost limit. Presumably these tablets too were built into the royal palace; the same text was also recorded by Layard (Ms. A, 12) on a pavement slab at the entrance of Room A. This reference to Lebanon is found, apparently, on all subsequent palace texts. The earliest available date for the Lebanon expedition is probably about 874, the latest about 867; so the text may be dated in late 874 or later. The same date can be assigned to another text with the Lebanon reference, which was written on the reverse of some of the stone panels and colossi which lined the palace walls and doors (Layard i85I : io- i; Grayson I976: I8I-2, No. 23). It has been recorded on Layard squeezes that are now destroyed and on slabs of unknown provenance in museums, but it or a very similar text survives on the reverse of the corner panel, BM 124557-8, from Room WG, and is common among the Layard copies (Ms. A, passim). In the North-West Palace it was written on the reverse of panels A-i, A-2, A-6, B-b-2 (colossal bull), B-d-2 (colossal lion), and probably G-8. In the South-West Palace of Esarhaddon, the walls of which were partly lined with panelling that had originally been in the North-West Palace, a text of this kind was recorded on the back of the following panels: C-I, C-2, d-2, j-I to j-6, j-8 tO j- I 2, k-I3 to k-I5, m-4 to m-9, jj-2,j-3, door d- i to d-3, and probably d- I, j-7, and j-4. The absence of panels from this list has no significance. We may fairly suppose that the text was written on the reverse of every North-West Palace panel. An expanded version of this text is Type A (Paley I976: Pl. 30) of the so-called Standard Inscription. The Standard Inscription, sometimes abbreviated, was cut on the face of the palace panels. Type A differs from Type B in several ways (Grayson 1976: I64-7, No. i3; Paley I976: 145-58; de Filippi I977: I0-17, 39-40), but the critical point for our immediate purpose is that it gives the area from the Subnat River source to " Nirbu " or the pass of the interior (kurjni-rib Id bi-ta-ni) as the northernmost limit of Ashurnasirpal's campaigns. This phrase clearly derives from the campaign of 882 B.C., when the king indeed marched from the Subnat source both to " Nirbu" and to the land of " Nirbu " or of the pass inside Mount Kashiari, kuni-ir-bu dt libbi kurkal-ia-ri (Budge and King 1902: 300; Grayson 1976: 125-7). The Standard Inscription with this variant is recorded in Ms. A on the unsculptured panels A- I to A-4, M-4, R-2 and R-3, and on the sculptured panels 1-3 to I-s, and I-29. Three extant panels from Room I indeed have this variant. Room I has one</page><page sequence="4">206 J. E. READE peculiarity: whereas it can easily be demonstrated that in other rooms the sculptures preceded the inscriptions, it is quite possible that in Room I the inscriptions preceded the sculptures. So the Type A version of the Standard Inscription may have been cut on plain panels throughout the palace, before there were sculptures at all. A literal reading of Ms. A, 93-5, where original notes in pencil have sometimes been emended in ink, would indicate that Type A of the Standard Inscription also existed on panels B-I2, B-I3 and B-i 6. A blurred photograph of B-i 6 has been published by Meuszynski (I976: 39, Fig. I 2); it is clear from a good print that this panel at least conforms with Type B at the critical point: the sign /i, part of the place-name Urarti, may just be discerned at the damaged beginning of line I I. Probably Layard's copies are of I- 1 2, I- 1 3 and I- I 6. Chronologically, as de Filippi has indicated (I977: 46), the next relevant change of phraseology in Ashurnasirpal texts is the substitution of the source of the Tigris for Nirbu of the Interior. A campaign to the source of the Tigris is probably to be dated at the earliest to 865, with 86 i as the latest possibility. The Tigris source is not mentioned, however, in the North-West Palace inscriptions. In Type B of the Standard Inscription the northernmost limit of Ashurnasirpal's conquests is given as Urartu. A campaign against Urartu was represented on a Balawat bronze (Barnett I973: 2 I), and should be dated about 864-860, probably earlier rather than later since Ashurnasirpal died in 859. A glance through the major sources having legible illustrations or specific notes shows Type B on the following North-West Palace panels: B-i, B-23, B-26, B-30, C-3, D-7, F-3, F-4, F-6, G-2 to G-4, G-6, G-io, G-I2, G-27, G-29, G-a-i, G-d-i, G-e-i, H-i, H-2, H-4, H-5, H-9, H-I4, H-b- i, L-i, L-2, L-2o, L-35, L-36, S-3, S-I2, S-I3, T-7, T-8, T-a-i, and Z-3. Prints kindly sent me by Sobolewski show it on two panels found in the west wing, namely WJ-I and one recorded as from WM; it is also visibly on a panel, presumably originating in the west wing, published by Stearns (I96I: Pl. 53). To these we may add, from Ms. A, the following: from the North-West Palace, B-5, B-6, I-i which is the original of the Standard Inscription published by Layard (i85i : i) though there described as A-i, and I-2; and, from the South-West Palace, f-i which is an i 8-line text between the sculptures illustrated by Barnett and Falkner (I962: Pls CXVI and CXVIII), and k-i2 which is a I 7-line text above the sculpture illustrated by Barnett and Falkner (I962: P1. CXXIV).' Some other important palace fittings, notably the thronebase and the door colossi (Grayson I976: 148-50, No. 2), also have the Urartu reference. In the circumstances it seems likely that Type B of the Standard Inscription was standard on sculptured panels throughout the palace with the exception of Room I where it was, nonetheless, put on to two panels, I-i and 1-2, which were immediately to the left of the door. The difference between Types A and B of the Standard Inscription, and the absence of a North-West Palace text mentioning the Tigris source, indicate that the panelling and decorating of the building took well over a year. In the interval Panel f-2 in the South-West Palace had a 17-line text which can be identified as Type B, though the Urartu reference is lost, from other variants as listed by Paley (1976: 129-133): thus Abtani precedes Zabdani, the king of Patina is Lubarna rather than Liburna, and the palace includes the suites of cedar, cypress, and juniper wood, and the stores of iron, which Type A omits.</page><page sequence="5">TEXTS AND SCULPTURES FROM THE NORTH-WEST PALACE, NIMRUD 207 between the cutting of Type A in some rooms and that of Type B in others, the sculptures themselves were carved. There may also have been at least one change in the plan of the palace, as in Room H the panels H- I o and H-27 block what had once been entrances to Rooms J and M. On the other hand these essentially false panels may have had some special function, and their nature could have been concealed. By the date the palace was inaugurated, as recorded in the Banquet Stela (Grayson 1976: I72-6, No. I 7), it was described as having narrative art, possibly painted, on its walls. The war with Urartu had by then borne fruit, as the states of Malatya and Gurgum in the far north-west and Musasir in the north-east were among those which acknowledged a formal relationship with Assyria by sending representatives to the celebrations. In contrast to the earliest known text specifically referring to the North-West Palace, which must have been written within the period 875-867, this last one may be dated within the period 864-859, perhaps in practice about 86o. Later history of the palace Ashurnasirpal's son, Shalmaneser III, continued the construction work throughout Nimrud, and doubtless there were some changes in the North-West Palace over the next century and a half during which, we presume, it remained a royal residence. For instance, at some stage the wall panelling behind the thronebase in Room B was cut back, probably to accommodate a new baldachin. The last king known to have worked on the building is Sargon II, who cut an inscription in Room U and may have been responsible for some flowered doorsills in the vicinity (Paley and Sobolewski I 98 I : 86). Many royal objects of Sargon's reign have been found in the palace, and the late eighth century is a likely date of abandonment for the great hoard of bronzes found there by Layard (I853: I77-200) even if this cannot yet be demonstrably related to the booty stored in the palace by Sargon. There seems to be no evidence for official occupation of the building after Sargon's death, though individuals of some standing did use parts of it. During Esarhaddon's reign and perhaps at other times, wall panels were removed from many rooms for reuse elsewhere. Generally, we may imagine the state apartments of the North-West Palace in the seventh century as the equivalent area of a modern palace might become in comparable circumstances, a crumbling pile with inadequate custodians. While the ancient Assyrians have finished with it, however, the plan of the North- West Palace is still evolving. Thus Layard's original plan (I849: 1, Plan III facing p. 62), still the best known, is faulty where he did not have stone panels to guide him. A casual stroke of his or a draughtsman's pen created a solid wall along the centre of the north side of Room B, and this, though Layard himself later wished to correct it (1853: 654), passed through subsequent plans including Mallowan's until it acquired physical reality in the existing reconstruction of the wall, besides influenc- ing the plan of the throneroom, T i, of the Nimrud arsenal excavated in I962 (Mallowan I966: III, Plans III, VIII). For the state apartments of the North-West Palace, the plan prepared by Sobolewski (Meuszy'nski I98I : Plan 2) must now take precedence over others, but it is worth emphasizing that it too is not necessarily always based on archaeological remains (Paley and Sobolewski 1981: 96, note 21). Thus Paley and Sobolewski adopt the hypothesis of a door between Rooms Z and</page><page sequence="6">208 J. E. READE WG, though it is not present in the reconstruction, and we are entitled to question other details. For instance, the arrangements at the south end of Rooms WG and WH, through which Layard probably drove his trench for the removal of the G-b and S-e door colossi, seem particularly uncertain. It is also unlikely that the south door of Room WI is an original feature: Room WI is obviously a bathroom, part of a lay-out corresponding roughly to Rooms T 22-4 in the equivalent part of the state apartments in the arsenal (Mallowan I966: III, Plan VIII), and can hardly have had an original door leading directly into Room WK, though one might have been cut in the eighth century. The state apartments: further information Current basic information on the North-West Palace sculptures is contained in Meuszyn'ski (1976), Paley (I976), Paley and Sobolewski (I98I) and Meuszyxnski (198i), with a review of this last by Reade (1984). These publications virtually supersede Reade (i965), but as usual there is more to add. Room B B-4. In the upper middle part of the lower register of this panel there is a gap where Layard restored the figures of two defenders (Plate XXXVII a). A small detached fragment in the British Museum, numbered K 8543, fills the left end of the gap. It has part of a figure's hair and a few signs of the Standard Inscription. B- i o. Part of the missing fragment in the lower right corner of this panel, showing a horse in water, was found during the excavations of Abu es-Soof (I963: 67) and formerly displayed in position. Some time in the I960s it was placed in the Iraq Museum. B-28. The upper register, though seriously damaged by water and a horizontal saw- mark, is not " totally destroyed ". Photographs (Plate XXXVII b: compare Meuszy'nski I 975 a: 65, Fig. I 7) show four figures moving right: the one on the left is bearded, wears an ankle-long robe, and may be holding objects both in his raised right hand and in his lowered left one; the other three wear kilts, and the pattern of erosion suggests that the one in the middle is holding something up in front of himself. Further study of the original is needed to see if we can identify helpful details such as the type of shoe worn. Provisionally, I suppose the subject is a procession of tributaries. This, so far, is all we know of the compositions in the upper register on the north wall of Room B. Room Z Layard's manuscript, Ms. A, ioI, refers to the Standard Inscription on Z-6 and Z-7. A scrawl appears to state that " I " of these panels is " a slab with one large and two small winged figures ". Or it may possibly mean that Z-6 and Z-7 were one single slab of this unique type. Paley and Sobolewski (1I98I: 96-7) were therefore right in concluding that there was such a slab in Room Z. They identify it not unreasonably with Z-8, which may still be correct as Layard sometimes changed the numbering of slabs.</page><page sequence="7">TEXTS AND SCULPTURES FROM THE NORTH-WEST PALACE, NIMRUD 209 Room BB " A pair of small winged lions, the heads and upper part destroyed, were also discovered. They appeared to form an entrance into a chamber, were admirably designed and very carefully executed " (Layard I 849: I, 47). These lions were at the entrance of Room BB. Their inscription was well enough preserved to be copied (Layard: Ms. A, 63-6), and one would expect to find a drawing of the sculptures themselves, especially since they were among Layard's earliest discoveries at Nimrud. There is in the British Museum an unlabelled drawing of an appropriate winged lion, Or. Dr. IV, Misc. 4, that seems to be from Layard's hand (Plate XXXVIII). The lion is marked as being 6 feet long, with an extant height of 4 feet 4 inches (1 82.9 by I 32.1 cm). Layard's published plan (1849: 1, Plan III facing p. 62) makes the Room BB lions bigger than 6 feet long, but it looks like a rough sketch at this point. It is hard to know what Or. Dr. IV, Misc. 4, represents if not a BB lion. The very fact that the drawing is unlabelled suggests that Layard had not yet assigned a letter or number to the sculpture and that it was indeed an early find. This supposition may be supported by Or. Dr. IV, Misc. i, another unlabelled drawing in the same hand, on similar paper, and of exactly the same width as Or. Dr. IV, Misc. 4, is high. It clearly shows (Plate XXXIX) an Ashurnasirpal charioteer, marked as 2 foot 9 inches high (83.8 cm), from a narrative sculpture. This seems likely to correspond to one of the first sculptures found by Layard in the South-West Palace, panel f-2. Barnett and Falkner (I962: 25, PI. CXX) illustrated the lower register of this panel, but overlooked this drawing of the upper register which showed, in part, a warrior " without helmet, standing in a chariot, and holding the reins loosely in his hands. The horses had been destroyed." There is also a resemblance, in style and material, to other drawings in the South-West Palace series, notably Or. Dr. III, SW I3-I4. It seems plain that all these drawings were made about the same time, soon after Layard started finding sculptures at Nimrud. Room WG About 1972 the lower registers of two panels were exposed during clearance operations by the Iraq authorities. I am indebted to Sd Hazim Abd-al-Hamid, who was responible for the work, for allowing me to look at these panels in the Mosul Museum soon after their discovery. The photographs published here (Plate XL a, b) were taken by W. Jerke and most kindly sent to me by R. Sobolewski; I am extremely grateful to the Iraq State Organization for Antiquities and Heritage for permission to illustrate these important sculptures here. The panels seem to have been found in position, with their upper portions slightly weather-worn and scraped. They are briefly described in Iraq 35 (I 973), 193, where the provenance is said to have been the east wall of Room I6, which is now Room WG. Their subject-matter is a campaign through mountainous country, with three consecutive scenes represented. On the left the Assyrian king, right hand raised, faces a high official; the two appear to be at the top of a pass, with a pointed mountain peak or cairn visible between them in the distance. Behind the king are two armed courtiers, and two soldiers trampling through scrub. In the next scene, to the right, the king is on horseback, riding side-saddle with a platform for his feet, like Shalmaneser III on a Balawat bronze (King 19I5: PI. LVIII). A soldier helps</page><page sequence="8">210 J. E. READE support the king, and there are two more ahead, one leading the horse. In the third scene, the royal chariot waits in front of a burning town while the king, with two attendants behind him, presides over a triumphant review. Probably there was a group of Assyrian officers bringing prisoners and booty, or men with presents and tribute, towards him from the right. A similar type of episodic composition, though with the direction of movement from right to left, is attested on another panel from Room WG. This is BM 124557- 8, which again shows the king moving with an escort through mountainous country (Plate XLI a). It clearly came from the north-west corner of the room, as Rassam's discovery of it " near Chamber A " in December 1852 is recorded by Gadd (1936: 136) while its width, 82 + 93 cm, corresponds roughly to that of the base of a corner panel found in position by the Iraqi excavators. This panel, and some of those in Room WI, appear on a plan of Nimrud reproduced by Barnett and Falkner (1 962 : colour-plate at end). Room WI Fragments of the bases of panels have been found in this room, and must correspond to those reported by Rassam in this area, west of Room A, in early November I852 (Gadd I936: 2I2-3, 243). On the west wall, where a niche indicates the presence of a drain, there were apparently small figures representing " Nisroch and priests ", i.e. eagle-headed and anthropomorphic guardian spirits. In the north-west corner was a lion-hunt identifiable as one now in Berlin (VA 959) and there were fragments of at least one other panel. There is a group of original field drawings which seem to have been made by Hodder at about this time (Gadd I936: 2I3). Or. Dr. I, 5. Plate XLI b. Berlin, VA 962.

This lion-hunt fragment, with one lion on its hind feet and another below the chariot horses, presumably corresponds to that seen by Felix Jones in April i853 (Gadd I936: 2I3). It was published most recently by Meuszyinski (I975 b: 57) and is reproduced here (Plate XLIII c) by kind permission of the late Dr. G. R. Meyer of the Vorderasiatisches Museum. Brunswick (Maine), Bowdoin College, i86o. 5. Gift of Dr. H. B. Haskell. This scene of the king pouring a libation could correspond to one mentioned by Jones as a companion piece to VA 964.

West of the Bowdoin College Museum of Art.</page><page sequence="9">TEXTS AND SCULPTURES FROM THE NORTH-WEST PALACE, NIMRUD 2I I Two other fragments which might possibly belong to hunt or libation scenes are No. 29I9 in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, which shows two soldiers behind a chariot moving right (Reade I972: P1. XXXIV a), and BM I249I7, which shows two courtiers facing right, part of a group which would have included the king facing left in front of them (Reade I972: P1. XXXV a). There was space for four two-register panels on the north wall of Room WI, and there were probably four more on the south, and some to west and east. There is a lack of demonstrable joins between these fragments, however, and it seems likely that, while some did come from here, others did not. Internal stylistic criteria do not seem decisive in establishing interrelationships between them, and the questions will probably remain open unless more of the jigsaw can be found. Room WJ I am indebted to Sobolewski for information about one sculptured panel partly in position against the south wall of this room. It shows a guardian spirit in a horned cap beside a sacred tree, and there seems to be no evidence for narrative sculptures in this room. Room WM Sobolewski has also drawn my attention to a very worn panel, said to come from Room WM, which shows a chariot charging right in the lower register. It may represent the king in a bull-hunt, and might once have stood to the right of panel e- I in the South-West Palace (Barnett and Falkner I 962: P1. CXV). This new panel is most worn towards the bottom, however, as if it had been left out of position in the past, and the Room WM provenance may be secondary. Room WM is also a possible provenance for BM I24579 (Plate XLIV b), another panel with a lion-hunt in the lower register. This was found when Layard (i 849: I, 74-8) was digging a trench to remove colossal figures from the entrances of Rooms G and S to the side of the mound to the west. The trench must have run through the south end of the west wing, and been responsible for the loss of panels between Y-68 and Y-71 in the inner court; it may just be visible on the air photograph published by Barnett (I957: before p. I3), though not to be confused with the one, marked " military trench ", which is presumably that through which the B-b lions were removed in 1926-7. Layard recognized mudbrick walls in the area of his trench, and found BM I24579 face-down on the floor. He thought its quality exceptional, comparable with that of panels f-i and h-i in the South-West Palace (Barnett and Falkner I962: PIs. CXVI-CXVII), and that the latter pair might have come from the selfsame room. Other possible provenances, however, are the southern end of Room WG and the area between Rooms BB and WK, where careful re-excavation may yet tell us more about this important suite of public reception rooms. Provenance uncertain There is a fragment of sacred tree, with text, published by Van Soldt (I982: 48-9, 58), in Leiden. For drawing this to my attention, and for advice on other philogical points, I am indebted to Dr Irving Finkel.</page><page sequence="10">2I2 J. E. READE The identification of narrative compositions One thing that has long been clear is that the subject-matter of the sculptured panels in the North-West Palace was chosen and arranged, in some respects, with great deliberation. One out of numerous examples is the subtle way in which the processions of tributaries in the Court E panels lead, not up to panels showing the king and his entourage in accordance with normal convention, but up to a door through which, when open, the king's throne and possibly the king himself will have been manifest. Recent studies by Irene Winter (I98I; I983) have helped to document this feature of the palace, and have included effective suggestions on the relationship between the sculptures and the content of the royal inscriptions. For instance, the scenes of military narrative obviously bear some relationship to real events, and she has made a good case for the idea that all of them correspond exactly to incidents that really happened, some of which are described in the surviving, albeit very incomplete, annals of Ashurnasirpal. Thus the scenes on the new panels from Room WG (Plate XL a, b) recall the start of the 883 campaign (Grayson 1976: I22) when Ashurnasirpal went on foot through mountains, some of which were sharp as a dagger's point, and burned towns; but it is difficult to be confident that this is the specific campaign displayed, because there were other not dissimilar mountain campaigns. The scenes of military narrative from the throneroom, Room B (see, for instance, Meuszyn'ski I98I: Taf. 2-3), could be analysed as follows: B-3-a to B-7-a. Attack on town and return to camp, with soldiers playing catch with heads. Not identifiable. B-8-a to B-i i-a. Battle against enemy stationed on a mound, possibly an event preceding the attack in B-3-a/B-4-a. Not identifiable. B-3-b to B-8-b. Attack on town and review of prisoners. See next entry. B-9-b to B-i i-b. Crossing of a river, presumably the Euphrates and perhaps Ashurnasirpal's first crossing, opposite the town of Haridu (Grayson I976: 139). If so, then Haridu might be the town shown behind the review scene on B-8-b, and the town attacked on B-4-b/B-5-b might be Kipinu, which seems to have been Ashurnasirpal's only significant objective after the Haridu crossing. B- i 6-a to B- I 7-a. Perhaps the 878 siege of Suru in the land of Suhi, and the escape of the local king, Kudurru, across the Euphrates (Grayson I976: 138). B- i6-b to B-I 7-b. Review of prisoners. If it is correct that B-I 7-a represents Suru, then it seems not unlikely that these prisoners were Kudurru's supporters, including Sabdanu and Bel-apla-iddina. Ivory tusks are shown among the booty, and do not appear in the annals list, but they are illustrated among tribute sent by Kudurru on a Balawat bronze (Oates 1983: 45-6). B-28-a. Procession of tributaries? (Plate XXXVII b). Not identified. B-27-b to B-28-b. Battle against an enemy who are pursued towards a town on the far side of the water. The enemy horsemen, like the Assyrians, seem to be inexperienced riders, as they fight in pairs, with one man shooting while the other controls both horses. An old suggestion that they are Zagros Iranians, one of whom is demonstrating the " Parthian shot", can hardly be maintained (Barnett I967: 2997). The enemy in fact wear, so far as can be seen, high turbans such as are</page><page sequence="11">TEXTS AND SCULPTURES FROM THE NORTH-WEST PALACE, NIMRUD 21 3 characteristic of the people of Carchemish (King I915: Pls. XXXI-XXXIV; Barnett 1973: Pl. facing p. 22). So they are likely to be people from Carchemish or somewhere in the Carchemish-Patina region. If my tentative identifications, however, are compared with those put forward by Winter (i 98 I: I 5; I 983: 22-3), it will be found that in only one case, the Euphrates crossing scene, do they coincide. This is a simple case of different students using identical evidence to reach different conclusions, and others interested will have to decide their own preferences by assessing the evidence, and the gaps in the evidence, for themselves. In the meantime it may be unwise to read too much into these sculptures, in case our suggestions acquire a life of their own as the plan of the palace has done, and lead to schemes and reconstructions that are demonstrably wrong. What is clear is that the more we learn about the North-West Palace, the more surprises we have. For instance, the military narrative of Room WG appears to be much more tightly composed and plainly episodic than that of the throneroom, but the hunting narrative of Room WI is much more discursive. These and other differences between different parts of the palace partly reflect the preferences of the individual designers responsible, but they also serve to remind us that the building as a whole was to some significant extent experimental, built by a king with a taste for innovation, and its finer points are correspondingly unpredictable.
