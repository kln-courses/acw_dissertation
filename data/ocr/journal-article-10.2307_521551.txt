It groups together critics and theorists with quite different approaches and assumptions, and thus may come to mean little more than sophistication about theory. More important, since it is defined in opposition to structuralism, there are two further disadvantages: Elrst, it conspicuously fails to clarify or apply perspicuously to the work of some of the most important thinkers in this general region -- are Foucault and Lacan structuralist or post-structuralist? Second, the notion "post-structuralism" is usually based on a caricature of structuralism so that the most exciting structuralsit work is treated as post-structuralist, and in fact it becomes quite hard to find any interesting analysis that can be deemed properly or orthodoxly strjucturalist. The notion of post-structuralism is produced by reducing structuralism to a scientific semiotic project, convinced of the possibility of reducing all texts to a grammar or system of rules that would account for their meaning and functioning. Any interest in how events or texts evade, violate, or outplay the systems that make them possible is seen as post-structuralist. J. Hillis Miller, one of the champions of deconstruction in America, contrasts "uncanny" Dionysian or Nietzschean criticism -- post-structuralist -- with the work of those who "believe in the possibility of a structuralist inspired criticism as a rational or rationali7able activity, with agreed upon rules of procedure, given facts, and measurable results. This would be a discipline bringing literature out into the sunlight in a -happy positivism. 'l The terms in which post-structuralism has been distinguished from structuralism thus identify the latter with a scientific attempt to reduce works to their constituents and the former with an exploration of how 21</page><page sequence="3">works subvert or outplay the norms to which they supposedly refer. Post-structuralism is seen as interpretation rather than poetics, indeed as an interpretive activity which questions the very possibility of poetics. Whether one can identify post-structuralist interpretative activity with hermeneutics, however, is not at all clear, since it rejects in a variety of ways the traditional hermeneutic goal of recovering or reconstructing an original or authoritative meaning. Just to mention briefly what are generally regarded as the three most important strains of American post-structuralist criticism, a post-structuralist Marxism, energetically devoted to avoiding crude reductionism and to taking account of the fact that the history to which it appeals is a narrative construct, proposes different levels of symptomatic reading, as sketched for instance in the introduction to Fredric Jameson's The Political Unconscious: the work as symbolic act, the work as fragment of the antagonistic discourses of social classes, and the work as bearer of an ideology of form related to the traces or anticipations of various modes of production. Post-structuralist psychoanalytic criticism has turned from psychoanalyzing authors, characters, or works to focus on what literary and psychoanalytic writings can tell us about the interaction of textual and psychic mechanisms and about the crucial operations of transference and countertransference in psychoanalytic and literary interpretation. Finally, deconstruction, the most important strand of so-called "post-structuralism," has focused above all on the way in which the hierarchical oppositions of Western metaphysics are put in question by the workings of texts -- literary, philosophical, theoretical -- that rely on them or even promote them. In none of these cases has the goal been the reconstruction of an original meaning or even an attempt to identify the meaning most "intrinsic" to the text, most appropriate to its generic and cultural situation. One can thus question the simplistic, erroneous dichotomy between a structuralism which is blindly committed to poetics and a post-structuralism which recognizes the difficulties of that project and turns to interpretation. As Philip Lewis puts in it "The Post-Structuralist Condition," the best study of this problem, that "reading the work of pioneer structuralists such as Levi-Strauss and Barthes does not really show us that structuralism, as it aged, gradually became aware of its own limitations and problems, but rather that an acute self-critical awarenesss was there from the start and reinforced the scientific spirit of the structuralist enterprise."2 In practice, one could say, the structuralist notion of a science or complete "grammar" of forms serves as a methodological horizon for research that in fact frequently focuses on the ungrammatical or deviant, as in anthropological studies of pollution </page><page sequence="4">or taboo, or Foucault's structuralist histories of madness or prisons, or literary critical explorations of works that were said, precisely, to violate conventions of the literary system: the nouveau roman, Flaubert, Roussel, Sade. Just as structuralist studies of rules and codes may focus on irregularities, the deconstructive undoing of codes or critique of systems seems to reveal powerful regularities -- structures of deferral and displacement, or supplementarity, or parergonality (framing). In sum, if, as seems to be the case, structuralist science highlights surprising anomalies while deconstructive critiques bring out inexorable regularities, one must be suspicious of the easy opposition between a "scientific" structuralism and an "interpretive" post-structuralism. Post-structuralism has succeeded in the United States in a way that structuralism never did because it has seemed to comply with and reinforce the single most powerful assumption of American literary studies: that elucidation of the meaning of work is the goal of critical activity. Ever since the New Criticism displaced traditional literary history, interpretation of individual literary works has been the model of critical activity, the central concern of literary studies, and the standard by which any other type of activity is to be tested. The establishment of texts, or investigation of historical background, or reflections on problems of genre are seen as valuable and pertinent insofar as they contribute to richer, more compelling interpretations of literary works. Since the 1950's, one might say, the test of scholarly endeavors seems to have become their contribution to critical interpretation.3 The post-structuralist claim that theoretical frameworks or metalinguistic discourses are simply further interpretations has strengthened the presumption that interpretations are the only plausible goals of critical activity, and post-structuralist theoretical discourses are taken to be critical "approaches" that provide methods of interpretation.4 In particular, deconstruction, the major strain of post-structuralism, has been seen as a turning away from systematic structuralist projects, such as a poetics of narrative, to what Barbara Johnson calls " a teasing out of warring forces of signification within the text itself."5 However, if one were to accept the view that deconstruction urges critics to reject the systematic projects and elucidate individual works, one would be puzzled by Derrida's example. His writings do not, for example, seem devoted to identifying the distinctiveness of each work, but seem to focus on recurrent problems and structures. Indeed, a major complaint about deconstruction, by those who assume that it is a method of interpretation, is that deconstruction makes every work sound the same, a fact which perhaps should indicate that it is not engaged in a hermeneutic project. Moreover, deconstructive readings frequently focus on parts of texts 23-</page><page sequence="5">rather than on the contribution of parts to the meaning of the whole, as befits a hermeneutic enterprise. And the conclusions they reach are frequently claims about structures of language, operations of rhetoric, and convolutions of thought rather than claims about what a particular work means. For instance, in analyzing the way various writings are implicated in logocentrism, Derrida is investigating structural determinants of discourse, a topic pursued in other ways by structuralists. Although the concentration on individual texts, and the close reading of problematical phrases and passages may resemble the procedures of hermeneutics, the conclusions that can be drawn from his writings may be closer to the propositions of a poetics. There are, then, good reasons to question the facile assumption that because structuralism is poetics, post-structuralism is hermeneutics. One might, in particular, concentrate on the fact that post-structuralist readings -- whether or not they issue in anything properly called an interpretation of a text -- are notorious for their concentration on, their reading of, prior interpretations. The simplest way of distinguishing poetics from hermeneutics is to say that poetics takes interpretations as data to be accounted for (the task is to reconstruct the underlying system of conventions that accounts for the fact that the phenomena in question are interpreted in particular ways by members of a cultural community), while hermeneutics takes interpretations as the goal to be achieved. By this test, post-structuralist and particularly deconstructive analyses, resemble poetics as much as hermeneutics: they analyze prior readings, seeking to account for them, and read the text against its interpretations. In the past I have sought to challenge the primacy of interpretation without much success -- particularly in an essay optimistically entitled "Beyond Interpretation" -- by discussing the issue theoretically, arguing for the importance of a poetics. In this essay I would like to attempt another approach, exploring the possible relationships between making interpretations one's data and interpretation one's goal by engaging interpretation and interpretations directly. Can one interpret a poem without making interpretation the overriding goal? At this point, I leave behind explicit reflection on post-structuralism in order to pose this question, which I take to be of considerable importance for literary studies. My text is a poem much interpreted in discussions of Baudelaire and the modern poetic tradition -- a poem whose conflicting interpretations provide data for reflecting on the stakes of literary interpretation and the conceptions of poetic language and poetic structure on which conceptions of literary history and the practice of reading rely. 24</page><page sequence="6">Baudelaire's "Correspondances," has frequently been treated as a central document for the study of his poetics. Jean Pommier used it as the key to La Mystique de Baudelaire. Cherix's Commentaire des Fleurs du Mal identifies it as "la piece maitresse de la doctrine esthetique de Baudelaire," and Lloyd Austin's L 'Univers poetisue de Baudelaire " part de la doctrine des correspondances. Les meilleurs critiques baudelairiens n'ont pas manque d'accorder une importance capitale a l'ensemble des theories que Baudelaire a constitue autour de ce mot."6 Correspondances La Nature est un temple ou de vivants piliers Laissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles; L'homme y passe a travers des forets de symboles Qui l'observent avec des regards familiers. Comme de longs echos qui de loin se confondent Dans une tenebreuse et profonde unite Vaste comme la nuit et comme la clarte, Les parfums, les couleurs et les sons se repondent . II est des parfums frais comme des chairs d'enfants, Doux comme les hautbois, verts comme les prairies, - Et d'autres, corrompus, riches et triomphants, Ayant l'expansion des choses infinies, Comme l'ambre, le musc, le benjoin et l'encens, Qui chantent les transports de l'esprit et des sens. In undertaking a reading of this poem, I am interested in elucidating the stakes of readings, the assumptions and investments of the multifarious discussions of this poem and the methodological issues they raise. The two ground rules I set myself are, first, not to hold back from interpretation but to propose alternative readings as corrections or supplements to the interpretations of others -- providing the best interpretations I can -- and second, to take my own interpretations as data as well, even fhough structurally I cannot account for them. A good deal of tne scholarly energy devoted to this poem has worked to constitute an intertextual space for it that includes passages from Swedenborg. Schelling, Mme de Stael, Hoffmann, Balzac, Esquiros, Sainte-Beuve, Constant, ana oautier, not to mention Hugo and Lamartine. The first quatrain in particular, is seen as echoing a romantic topos: the visible forms of the universe are signs of an invisible spiritual reality. Citing texts which Baudelaire might have seen prior to 1846, Antoine Adam concludes, with a declaration in which he no doubt failed to see the humor, that "Le poete des Fleurs du Mal ne pouvait donc ignorer, des cette epoque, l'idee que forme le premier mouvement de son sonnet." 7 [The poet of the Fleurs du Mal therefore could not have been 25</page><page sequence="7">ignorant at this time of the idea that forms the first movement of his sonnet.l This is the idea of vertical correspondence: relations between material signifiers and spiritual signifieds or what Baudelaire calls "cet admirable, cet immortel instinct du Beau qui nous fait considerer la terre et ses spectacles comme un apersu, comme une correspondance du Ciel." 81this admirable, immortal instinct of beauty, which makes us consider the earth and its spectacles as a glimpse or correspondence of heaven.] Interpretations adduce parallels to the poem's opening statement, "La nature est un temple," from Hugo and Lamartine for instance. Here is Hugo: C'est Dieu qui remplit tout. Le monde, c'est son temple. Oeuvre vivante, ou tout l'ecoute et le contemple! Tout lui parle et le chante.9 Here is Lamartine: Dieu cache, disais tu, la, nature est ton temple! L'esprit te voit partout quand notre oeil la contemple.'0 And again: L'univers est le temple, et la terre est l'autel. * * . Mais ce temple est sans voix. Ou sont les saints concerts? * . i Tout se tait: mon coeur seul parle dans ce silence. La voix de l'univers, c'est mon intelligence.1l Correspondances echoes these passages, but there is a question about the meaning of such echoes or correspondences, which can be taken as reiteration and affirmation or as ironic repetition. In Baudelaire's temple, living pillars -- are these people or trees?--"laissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles." It is as though in compromising between Hugo's version, in which everything speaks and sings, and Lamartine's version where "Tout se tait", Baudelaire had let things speak sometimes, giving us, if not a compromise that parodies the alternatives, at least an undermining of the continuous, authoritative signifying relation that seemed the basis of any doctrine of correspondences. The symbolic relation is confused and intermittent, and while c&lt;mmentators identify here as the underlying image Chateaubriand's comparison of the forest to a cathedral, it is not clear that we are in fact in a forest: we are told that man passes not through forests that are symbolic but through "des forets de symboles," forests of symbols. "Forest" may be a figure not of spirituality but of enumeration and confusion (in the "Salon de 1859" Baudelaire evokes the possibility of 26</page><page sequence="8">being "perdu dans une foret d'originalites" [lost in a forest of originalities]). 12 Interpretations focusing on the first stanza have generally emphasized the forceful articulation of a doctrine of vertical correspondances, though the intermittent symbolic relation raises enough questions to suggest that this reading may owe a good deal to the premise of continuity that sustains source-hunting. In recent years, however, readings of the sonnet have shifted attention from the vertical correspondences to the so-called horizontal correspondences of the remaining quatrain and tercets. Leo Bersani's Baudelaire and Freud provides a vigorous example. Readers of thls poem nave frequently been misled by the reference to Nature as containing "forests of symbols" in the first stanza. This presumably refers to a system of vertical correspondences: the "temple" of Nature is replete with symbols of spiritual reality. In fact, the metaphysical suggestiveness of the first four verses is simply dropped in the second and third stanzas. We move from vertical transcendence to horizontal "unity." "Les parfums, les couleurs et les sons se repondent": that is, stimuli ordinarily associated with one of our senses can produce sensations "belonging" to another sense. Baudelaire asserts, and in the third stanza illustrates, the reality of these analogies (certain perfumes, for example, are "green as fields"). "Correspondances" does present itself as a doctrinaire poem (thus the countless critical efforts to extract the doctrines, to find its sources in nineteenth century esthetics, philosophy, and psychology) and the doctrine which the poem espouses and vaguely outlines has nluch less to do with symbolism in Nature than with a metaphorical unity within Nature. Comparisons using the word comme occur six times in the two middle stanzas, and we might think of this as a stylistic demonstration of those "echoes" of a distant likeness which the poet asks us to hear in each of our experiences.13 Baudelaire's notion of "un clavier de correspondances" suggests that the poet's task might be to construct melodies out of the metaphorical equivalents between sensations of various sorts. The last four lines move from tropes that relate one sensory experience to another to the more general claim that certain sensations effect a spiritualization, that they explicitly thematize the movement beyond sense suggested by synesthesias: they "chantent les transports de l'esprit et des sens." We have here, it seems, a notable poetic adumbration of a symbolist aesthetics, but such a reading of this "doctrinaire poem" depends on an understanding of another set of intertextual relations, correspondences between the verse text and various prose texts which it echoes: the 27</page><page sequence="9">theoretical statements about analogies, correspondences, colors, smells and sounds, etc. Here a problem arises. Antoine Adam writes. I1 est notable, pourtant, que s'il existe un texte de Baudelaire qui offre des analogies de pensee et d'expression avec le sonnet, c'est bien moins le Salon de 1846 que l'article sur L'Exposition Universelle de 1855. Le mot de correspondance s'y trouve, et dans une phrase qui est comme le commentaire du sonnet: le professeur d'esthetique est un barbare "qui a oublie la couleur du ciel, la forme du vegetal, le mouvement et l'odeur de l'animalite, et dont les doigts crispes, paralyses par la plume, ne peuvent plus courir avec agilite sur l'immense clavier des correspondances.''l4[It is striking, though, that if there exists a text by Baudelaire that offers analogies of thought and expression with the sonnet, it is less the Salon de 1846 than the article on the Exposition Universelle de 1855. The word correspondance appears there, and in a sentence that is like a commentary on the sonnet: the professor of aesthetics is a barbarian "who has forgotten the color of the sky, the form of the vegetal, the movement and scent of animality, and whose clenched fingers, paralyzed by the pen, can no longer play with agility on the immense keyboard of correspondences. "] One might note the initial complication that the passage of aesthetic writing which Adam calls "comme un commentaire du sonnet" is about the inability of a professeur d'esthetique to play with and appreciate correspondences. When the piece of aesthetic writing that offers the best "analogie de pensee et d'expression avec le sonnet" concerns the incompatibility of works of art and aesthetic doctrine, this at least raises a question about the relation of correspondence critics must take for granted in discussing a doctrine of correspondences. The prose text continues more explicitly to address this question. Tout le monde consoit sans peine que si les hommes charges d'exprimer le beau se conformaient aux regles des professeursjures, le beau lui-meme disparaitrait de la terre, puisque tous les types, toutes les idees, toutes les sensations se confondraient dans une vaste unite, monotone et impersonnelle, immense comme 1 ' ennui et le neant.l5[Everyone easily conceives that if the men charged with expressing the beautiful obeyed the rules of the professorHudges, beauty itself would disappear from the earth, since all types, all ideas, all sensations, would blend in a vast unity, monotonous and impersonal, as immense as boredom and nothingness.] 28</page><page sequence="10">There are striking echoes here. Prose Poem Se confondrait se confondent, dans une vaste unite dans une tenebreuse et profonde unite vaste unite, immense comme l'ennui unite vaste comme la nuit There is an exchange of letters involved (I'ennui, la nuit), if not a correspondence. Antoine Adam declares categorically that "la tenebreuse et profonde unite of which the sonnet speaks is unrelated to (sans rapport avec) the unite monotone et impersonnelle of which the article on the Exposition Universelle speaks.''l6 The critic's position here is not an altogether comfortable one. At stake for Adam is the doctrine of correspondences, which he seeks to maintain by denying the correspondence between these passages: "A la realite metaphysique des correspondances il croit de la facon la plus ferme, et il est inconcevable qu'on ait pu soutenir le contraire."l7 One could, however, maintain the inconceivable position, contesting the absolute firmness of Baudelaire's commitment to the metaphysical doctrine, by exploiting the correspondence between these texts, insisting on the relevance to one another of the echoing descriptions of unity. In both Baudelaire's prose text and his poem, for instance, unity results from the failure to distinguish: professors have forgotten the distinctiveness of each thing and thus everything is confused in this vast monotonous unity. In the poem, echoes heard from afar blend into a unity -- vaste comme la nuit et comme la clarte -- a nuit, perhaps, ou tous les chats sont noir (night and luminosity share the property of making it difficult to distinguish). Nor are these texts exceptional. "De la couleur" in the Salon of 1846, which cites Hoffmann on correspondences and celebrates vibration of color, describes the unity of nature like this: "et comme la vapeur de la saison, -- hiver ou ete, - baigne, adoucit, ou engloutit les contours, la nature ressemble a un tonton qui, mu par une vitesse acceleree, nous apparal^t gris, bien qu'il resume en lui toutes les couleurs.''l8 lAnd since the vapor of the season -- winter or summer -- bathes, softens or engulfs all contours, nature resembles a top which, spinning swiftly, appears to us grey, although it has all the colors on it.] Unity is the result of confusion, the effacement of difference. Generally, every description of unity is based on tropes that suppress difference, and this creates a certain ambivalence, as the alternation of values between these corresponding texts shows. 29</page><page sequence="11">A reading treating unity as a tropological product would doubtless go on to examine what is asserted in the tercets: first, the ability of certain stimuli to evoke sensations belonging to other senses, and second the indeterminate signifying possibilities of certain "parfums." The poem links synthesia with verbal art by asserting links between sensations that seem to rely on verbal echoes or relays, whether semantic or phonological: chairs connects with doux by a pun that is close to the surface in chairs d'enfants ("cheres enfants"); the bois of hautbois helps to justify verts, in verts comme des prairies, where verts itself is echoed in the first syllable &gt; * . OI pralrles. 11 est des parfums frais comme des chairs d'enfants, Doux comme les hautbois, verts commes les prairies... But the tercets also distinguish the regular, specifiable relations between sweet or innocent smells and the corresponding sounds and colors from the indeterminate signifying possibilities of corrupt, rich and triumphant smells. Why smells, one wants to know? If the point is, as Leo Bersoni claimed in the passage I quoted earlier, to assert the metaphorical unity of the universe, to present a stylistic demonstration of "the echoes of a distant likeness which the poet asks us to hear in each of our experiences," why should smells have been selected as the case in point? The answer might be is that of all sensations smells are the most inextricably linked with tropological, specifically metonymical operations. Other sensations may have literal names. Smells mnemonically generate chains of metonymiqal associations: to name a smell is to metonymically describe its cause or the circumstances in which one first smelled it (unlike colors, which have names of their own), so that smells hold the attention to reorient it towards what surrounds them, in the poetic, (discursive and descriptive) movement evoked in Baudelaire's "Parfum exotique" or "La Chevelure," or the prose poem, "Une hemisphere dans une chevelure." Smell is the sensation here il n'y a pas de propre, and which joins the mnemonic power of recognition to the discursive exfoliation of a metonymical imagination. I have here outlined two kinds of intertextual explorations whose methodological compatibility should not be taken for granted but which do, taken together, generate a plausible reading of the poem. The first placed the sonnet in the intertextual space of possible sources, a persistent prior discourse about nature and templesw and sought to treat the poem either as an affirmation or as an ironic repetition or transformation of this language. If one feels no loyalty to the doctrine of vertical correspondences and thinks that lyric poetry can better be explained and 30</page><page sequence="12">justified in other ways, then one will no doubt find the second, ironic possibility more attractive and productive, since taking the poem to undermine the transcendental claims that it cites and modifies prepares the way for the second quatrain. The second approach (for the second quatrain), emphasizing verbal echoes or repetitions within the Baudelairian corpus, sought to make the so-called doctrine of horizontal correspondences more textual and tropological. Bringing thematically distinct texts closer to each other, suggesting that in their repetition they infect one another, showing that unity might be viewed as a tropological effect, foregrounding the ambiguity of "se confondent," one reinstated "Correspondance" as an art poetique. Combining these procedures, which seem to work in different directions and on different principles, nevertheless generates a reading of the poem, according to which the ironic treatment of doctrines in the first two quatrains sets the stage for the assertion of tropological relations in the tercets. These assertions are cast in terms that suggest, on the one hand, that supposedly natural or inherent equivalences of sensory qualities may depend on verbal links, and second, that what is most valued is the process (epitomized by smell) of metonymical extrapolation from sensation -- quite literal "transports de l'esprit et des sens." "Correspondances", often thought to declare that the natural is a sign of the divine, by this reading in fact celebrates the poetic process whereby the smell of hair evokes or generates a hemisphere. Briefly and schematically, the various interpretations suggest that "Correspondances" has been an important poem for three reasons. First, because its definition of our encounter with the world as a passage through "des forets de symboles" has seemed aesthetically productive: the world as a forest of signs accessible to poets and visionaries. "Correspondances" seems to be the economical enunciation of principles of aesthetic signification that are at work in Baudelaire's oeuvre, as it explores correspondences between le mal and la beaute or la boue et l'or, for example. Second, the poem is important because it echoes numerous statements of Baudelaire's prose writings -- about correspondances, analogie universelle, -- and in so doing works to confirm the possibility of a correspondence between poems and prose accounts of aesthetic principles. If critics make much of "Correspondances," it is partly because criticism relies on the possibility of a correspondence between poems and poetics. As a poem based on what Lloyd Austin calls "la doctrine des correspondances," "Correspondances" confirms the vital possibility of a close, signifying relation between poems and critical statements.l9 31</page><page sequence="13">Third, "Correspondances" is essential to any attempt to situate Baudelaire in a story of modern poetry because of its echoes of a range of romantic sources, not to speak of the echoes of it in the later poetic tradition. Marcel Raymond, for example, makes it the point of departure for the trajectory summed up by his title, De Baudelaire au surrealisme. More recently, in an essay entitled "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric" in The Rhetoric of Romanticism, Paul de Man declares of "Correspondances" that "it, and it alone, contains, implies, produces, generates, permits (or whatever aberrant verbal metaphor one wishes to choose) the entire possibility of the [yric."20 What seems to be at stake in all these interpretive possibilities is the preservation of "Correspondances" as a key, doctrinal poem: both a Baudelairian art poetique and a key poem for any literary history that wants to integrate Baudelaire in a story of post-Enlightenment poetry. Even contradictory interpretations seem to leave intact the notion of "Correspondances" as at once the culmination of the Romantic doctrine of vertical correspondences, the adumbration of a symbolist aesthetic, and the point of departure for surrealism. The poem, that is to say, brings about a change of direction, echoing romantic doctrine but, with an ironic twist, sending things off in a new direction; through its ironic repetition, making correspondence no longer one-to-one divinely sanctioned relation but rather a metonymical exfoliation such as is set off by the recognition of a smell. The romantic line runs into this poem; the modernist line runs out of it. The change from one line to another takes place at the Baudelaire correspondence. These interpretive convergences, the very plausibility of a synthetic interpretive overview that transcends major disagreements -- about the presence or absence of irony, the value of unity, whether we are in a forest or in the city -- may tell us a good deal about our conceptions of lyric and demands on lyric. To encourage the project of treating our interpretations as data to be explained, I should like to note a couple of objections to this satisfying convergence -- objections which might encourage us to see it as the product of conventional and generic demands. The first bears on the notion that this poem is a Baudelairian, art poetique. As Sandro Genovali observes in Baudelaire, O della dissonanza, there are actually very few synesthesias in Baudelaire -- "des parfums verts" is not a familiar kind of image in Baudelaire but, on the contrary, very rare.21 There are poems that talk about synesthesia -- "j'aime a la fureur/Les choses ou le son se mele a la lumiere" (Les Bijoux), but it is not a major poetic technique. So an initial problem is that if 32</page><page sequence="14">"Correspondances" is about poetry, it is not describing what this poetry does. Still, one might answer this valid objection by conceding that Baudelaire is not interested in synesthesia, as first tercet suggests, so much as in sensations as stimuli to reverie, memory, imagination: the other smells corropus, riches, triomphants. Ayant l'expansion des choses infinies, ... Qui chantent les transports de l'esprit et des sens. This exfoliation is both the subject of poetry and the process of poetic production, and in taking "Correspondances" as an art poetique one can bracket the first two lines of the tercets while;concentrating on the last four. This defense, however, only increases the pertinence of the second objection, which bears on the interpretation of the tercets as glorifying tropological relations - specifically on such claims as Leo Bersani's that comparisons using the word comme demonstrate the relations we are invited to perceive in nature. Paul de Man notes of the final comme in the poem ("Et d'autres, comme l'ombre, le musc, le benjoin et l'encens"), "Ce comme n'est pas un 'comme' comme les autres." It is not comparative, bringing together different sorts of sensations, bridging gaps in a metaphorical transfer of properties or fusion involving analogy ("des parfums frais comme des chairs d'enfants"). It is a comme of enumeration -- smells such as a, b, c -- opening a list which can go on without getting us anywhere else. De Man writes, Considered from the perspective of the "thesis" or of the symbolist ideology of the text, such a use of "comme" is aberrant. For although the burden of totalizing expansion seems to be attributed to these particular scents rather than the others, the logic of "comme" restricts the semantic field of "parfums" and confines it to a tautology: "I1 est des parfums.../ Comme (des parfums)." Instead of analogy, we have enumeration, and an enumeration which never moves beyond the confines of a set of particulars:...the enumeration could be continued at will without ceasing to be a repetition, without ceasing to be an obsession rather than a metamorphosis, let alone a rebirth. One wonders if the evil connotations of these corrupt scents do not stem from the syntax rather than from the Turkish bath or black mass atmosphere one would otherwise have to conjure up. For what could be more perverse or corruptive for a metaphor aspiring to transcendental totality than remaining stuck in an enumeration that never goes anywhere?... Enumerative repetition disrupts the chain of tropological substitution at the crucial moment when the poem promises, by way of these very substitutions, to reconcile the pleasures 33</page><page sequence="15">of the mind with those of the senses and to unite aesthetics with epistemology. That the very word on which these substitutions depend would just then lose its syntactical and semantic univocity is too striking a coincidence not to be like pure chance, beyond the control of author and reader.23 This shift to a comme of enumeration does rather disrupt the synthesis that takes the tercets as a celebration of the tropological productivity of poetic imagination and memory (poetry as the exploitation of a clavier de correspondances). The question, then, is what does one do with this significant textual detail, whose very flatness and negativity makes it extremely seductive. The hermeneutic imperative, which seeks to transmute negatives into positives, tempts us to make this the basis for a new interpretation of the poem. There would be a strong temptation, then, to make a further interpretive move and take the poem to be about the disruption of tropological substitution and its totalizing goals by the sheer materiality of language, and thus ultimately to read "Correspondances" as a poem that demystifies lyric. Such moves are tempting because of our assumnption that to produce a new interpretation of a major literary work is the goal of the critical endeavor, but I wish to resist it and to ask whether resistance makes any difference. Would it make any difference, that is, to think that instead of working at a new reading of the poem one were in fact attempting to move towards an elucidation of the interpretive processes associated with lyric? De Man remarks, suggestively, that "The lyric is not a genre but one name among several to designate a defensive motion of understanding, the possibility of a future hermeneutics."23 The lyric seems to consist of patterns of anthropomorphism and naturalization that guarantee the intelligibility of tropes. Here, in readings of a poem that has long been taken as exemplary not of the lyric but of a poetics of the lyric, we have observed among other things the use of the notion of intertextuality as a fundamentally recuperative strategy, ultimately a strategy for making sense of sheer repetition. My two approaches to Baudelairian intertextuality in effect recuperated intertextual echoes as a potential attitude of consciousness -- what at the thematic or psychological level we call "irony". Study of the interpretive moves illustrated in both the tradition and our response to that tradition would show how genres, such as lyric, are sets of reading strategies for making sense of language, ways of convincing ourselves not only that language is meaningful, that it will give rise to an intuition or understanding, as would be amply illustrated by our interpretive examples, but also that this is an understanding of the world. 34</page><page sequence="16">To take interpretations as data rather than goals does not mean an end to interpretation but rather a displacement of our present goal: the production of new interpetations of literary texts as the aim and the test of literary study. Encouraging an understanding of language and genre, which now often have to be achieved by interpreting works as allegories of reading rather than by interpreting readings themselves, this would give us a more capacious, differently articulated domain of knowledge and might also discourage the impression so many of our colleagues in other fields seem to have gained, that what we in literary studies think of as knowledge is in fact just an endless series of ingenious interpetations. 35</page><page sequence="17">Notes 1 .

In effect, the New Criticism created a new type of knowledge: to produce interpretations of poems is to make a contribution to knowledge. The result, however, has been a curious overlay. While scholarship is deemed relevant to the extent that it contributes to criticism, nevertheless the field of literary studies remains organized, for the most part, according to the historica1 periods identified by traditional scholarship. These persistent institutional arrangements exert considerable pressure on criticism, encouraging teachers to engage in historically circumscribed projects and substantially modifying the triumph of the New Criticism, which while criticism nevertheless persists in the assumption that interpretations are the goals of literary study and literary research. 4.
