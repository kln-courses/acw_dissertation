<plain_text><page sequence="1">Making Liberal Theology Metaphysical: Personalist Idealism as a Theological School Gary Dorrien / Kalamazoo College The personalist option in theology, like the idealist philosophical tradition on which it was dependent, no longer attracts a significant following. Since the mid-1960s, the Chicago School offshoots of pragmatic empiricism and Whiteheadian process theology have played leading roles in what remains of American liberal theology, while barely a handful of theologians continue to uphold the personalist approach. But for two of its five generations, the school of personalist idealism centered at Boston University was the stronger force in American theology, keeping alive a vital and influential form of theological liberalism. Though the high tide of the personalist approach occurred long ago, during the school's second generation, the possibility of a personalist renewal is no more inconceivable than that of a new idealism. The personalist option was based on the assertion of the metaphysical and ethical ultimacy of personality, and as a form of distinctively modern theology, it affirmed the whole menu of options. Having judged that credible religious claims cannot be based on external authority, the founders of modern theology argued variously for ethical conviction, religious experience, and metaphysical reason as the basis of theology. Immanuel Kant contended that religion has its home in the moral concerns of practical reason; Friedrich Schleiermacher argued that religious experience or intuition is the wellspring of religion; G. W. F. Hegel developed a philosophy of Absolute Spirit in which the images of religious myth gave way to the concepts of metaphysical reason. For over a century liberal theology was usually Kantian or Schleiermacherian or Hegelian, or a blend of Schleiermacher and Hegel (as in German mediating theology), or a blend of Kant, Schleiermacher, and Coleridge (as in American transcendentalism and religious liberalism), or a blend of Kant, Schleiermacher, and modern historicism (as in the Ritschlian school). In the social gospel era most American progressives took the Ritschlian option, which excluded metaphysical reason, while some adopted the naturalistic empiricism of the Chicago school, which swept aside the transcendental a prioris of Kant, Schleiermacher, and Hegel.</page><page sequence="2">Vol. 24, No. 3, September 2003 215 Unlike German theological liberalism, the American tradition was not friendly to metaphysical speculation. In the early years of the twentieth century, America produced its share of neo-Hegelian philosophers, notably Josiah Royce and W. E. Hocking, but the party of Hegel had little theological following in the United States. Leading theologians like William Adams Brown and Walter Rauschenbusch appealed to the social-ethical, historicist, and evangelical aspects of Ritschlian theology while accepting RitschFs contention that theology was better off making no resort to metaphysical claims. The latter conviction ruled the field of theology, both in its dominant Ritschlian forms and in the semi-philosophical empiricism of the early Chicago school. Personalist liberalism was the exception During the period that other American theological liberals eschewed metaphysical arguments, the personalists insistently played the entire field of options, vigorously holding out for the primacy and necessity of metaphysical reason. Taking its inspiration from the philosophy of a single thinker, Borden Parker Bowne, the personalist school affirmed moral intuition and religious experience and the social gospel and metaphysical reason. Hegel was half-right, and so were Kant, Schleiermacher, Ritsehl, and the social gospelers. What was needed was a liberal theology that synthesized the best aspects of its rival modern sources. Philosophically and theologically, Borden Parker Bowne showed the way, but even Bowne shortchanged the social meaning of Christianity. His disciples sought to rehabilitate liberal theology along Bowne's philosophical lines. To them the Ritschlian social gospel was too thin to hold the field, because it banished metaphysical reason. The naturalistic empiricism of Chicago theology seemed equally impoverished to them, while the paradoxical dialectics of a rising American neoorthodoxy were even worse. Against these options, the thinkers who developed Bowne's personalistic idealism into a major theological school added socio-ethical commitments to Bowne's philosophy. They developed a theological school that espoused typical liberal causes and a distinctive metaphysical basis, and their impact on American Methodism was immense. Persistently they admonished that every theology is only as good as the philosophy behind it.</page><page sequence="3">216 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Theorizing Personalist Idealism: Borden Parker Bowne he founding principle of Bowne s philosophical system was that A personality is the single reality that cannot be explained by anything else. With Descartes, Bowne taught that the existence of the soul is know n immediately as the experience of consciousness, though Bowne rejected Descartes's absolute dualism of body and soul. From Leibniz he took the idea of spiritual individualism and the theory of the soul as essentially active. With Berkeley and G?ttingen philosopher Rudolf Hermann Lotze, he argued that self-consciousness is the necessary presupposition of all thinking and the world of objects, though unlike Berkeley, Bowne affirmed the existence of a world of objects external to consciousness, and unlike Lotze, he strongly believed in the freedom of the will and the immortality of the soul With Schleiermacher he taught that the wellspring of religion is religious experience; with William James he contended that pragmatic experience is the test of truth, though Bowne eschewed James's anti metaphysical temper. From Kant he took the basic elements of his critically idealistic epistemology and his ethical conception of the person, though Bowne sharply rejected Kant's doctrine of the unknowable "thing-in-itself ,] Bowne's philosophical mentor, Lotze, leaned toward monism, but Bowne was a metaphysical pluralist. He argued that the organic unity of nature in spirit can be affirmed without denigrating the metaphysical reality of finite persons and the empirical experience of the world as real and plural. Because the natural sciences are necessarily mechanistic, he contended, they cannot account for the reality or unity of consciousness. It is possible to move from mind to matter, but matter cannot be the ultimate or sufficient cause of mind Bowne took experience as a whole as his datum and questioned how reality should be thought of on the basis of particular experiences as interpreted by thought. His works on epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and theism centered on the thesis that the reality of personal consciousness cannot be explained on impersonal grounds, but everything can be accounted for by the reality of consciousness. Bowne's personalist idealism was basically Kantian inasmuch as it emphasized the creative role of mind in producing experience, the 1 See Gary Dornen, The Making of American Liberal Theology: Imagining Progressive Religion, 1805-1900 (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2001 ), 370-392.</page><page sequence="4">Vol. 24, No. 3, September 2003 217 notion of the person as an ethical end-in-itself. and the reality of the world of things external to consciousness. At the same time, Bowne rejected Kant's noumenal "thing-in-itself," because it failed to describe or secure the reality of an external world, and he insisted against Kant that purpose is constitutive in theoretical reason. Bowne allowed that purpose does not quite belong on the same plane as the (Kantian) categories of being, space, time, and causality, because it plays little role in prereflective experience. But purpose is indispensable to reflective thought and is constitutive of it, he argued. The Kantian transcendentals by themselves leave us cut off from things and events. It is purpose?a higher category of thought?that unifies our fields of experience. Purpose is causality raised to the level of intelligent and volitional agency. In its higher forms, Bowne contended, thought has no basis of maintaining itself or of gaining systematic completeness without meaning. There is no knowing without intelligence, and intelligence is nothing without purpose. Here, as always, the crucial point for Bowne was the necessity of adopting a personal worldview: 'The principle we need here can never be found in any impersonal or mechanical conception whatever. The unity and system demanded must be internal, and this true inwardness can be found only in self determining, self-conscious causality, guiding itself according to plan and purpose."2 Reason must account for all dimensions of human experience. Against Kant's restriction of pure reason to knowledge of phenomena, Bowne insisted that reason has vitally important work to do in other fields besides science. Kant excluded from pure reason the deepest and most certain knowledge that reason possesses, which is the selfs knowledge of itself While allowing that science rightly treats things as mere phenomena, Bowne countered that tsto look upon the self which views these phenomena as itself phenomenal in the same sense is altogether impossible."3 With an air of victory he preached to his students the primacy of spirit over the things of sense and the superiority of metaphysics over other forms of understanding. Theologically Bowne was a liberal Methodist who affirmed a 2 Borden Parker Bowne, Theory of Thought and Knowledge (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1897), quote, 104-105; Bowne, Metaphysics (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1898). 3Borden Parker Bowne, Personalism (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin and Co., 1908), quote, 88; see Bowne, Theory of Thought and Knowledge, 302-316.</page><page sequence="5">218 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Schleiermacherian view of self-authenticating religious experience, a Schleiermacherian understanding of the divinity of Christ, and the Abelardian moral-influence theory of atonement. Ethically he was a strong voluntarist and neo-Kantian moralist whose individualism made him allergic to most social gospel causes. Bowne affirmed the social gospel principle that true religion is ethical without remainder, and he supported feminism as a movement for individual rights, but he disdained trade unions, showed little feeling for people beneath his social class, and had no use for sociological perspectives. For many years he puzzled over what he should call his system In his early work he stressed the objective idealist thesis that there is an objective order outside the self that experiencing subjects find, not create. Between the years 1896-1904, however, as Rufus Burrow, Jr. has shown, Bowne called himself a ''transcendental empiricist," emphasizing that mind is the explanation of experience that itself cannot be explained. By 1904 he had moved to a thoroughgoing emphasis on the priority of the self over the categories of thought, which prompted him to identify with a less forbidding label. "Personalist idealism" would have worked, but that name was claimed by Bowne's University of California contemporary , George Holmes Howison. Bowne settled on "personalism," affirming that the fundamental matter to him was the ultimacy of personal mind: ?i am a Personalist, the first of the clan in any thoroughgoing sense/7 The transcendental categories of thought are revealed in the experience of a self; they do not create or determine the self s experience. 4 His disciples were a bit slow to acquire the infrastructure and movement-momentum of a school, but by 1925, fifteen years after Bowne's death, Bowne-style personalism had an institutional center, a journal, and a movement consciousness. Philosophically, like Bowne, it was epistemologically dualistic, metaphysically pluralist, and ethical in orientation, but unlike Bowne, its ethical orientation favored the social gospel.

Knudson: The Making of a Theologian Albert Knudson was a product of midwest-American Methodist piety and a graduate school conversion. He was born in 1873 in Grandmeadow, Minnesota, where his father was a distinguished Methodist pastor. Both of his parents were immigrants from Norway; Knudson later recalled that the sanctiflcationist Wesleyan piety of his parents was "all very7 simple, but it was intensely real and vivid." It remained vitally real to him long after he discarded much of his father s orthodox theology.5 As an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota Knudson drifted toward the neo-Hegelianism of a favorite teacher, who steered him to Josiah Royce s The Spirit of Modern Philosophy and Edward Caird's The Evolution of Religion. Knudson felt edified and newly sophisticated upon reading these books.

A prime example was Caird's conception of a unity implied in subject and object that transcends both subject and object. Caird identified this vague unity with God; Knudson scratched his head: It left me in a fog, and that was where I found myself at the end of my college course/'0 Naturalistic materialism was never an option for him; common sense realism merely scratched the surface; neo-Hegelian idealism was strangely elusive. Philosophically and theologically Knudson was confused. His single certainty was the reality of his personal religious experience: "There I found something of incomparable worth? something that I could preach.7,7 On the strength of this conviction he enrolled at the Boston University School of Theology, where he studied theology, but caught the uncertainty of his teachers. Only his Old Testament professor, young Hinckley Mitchell, seemed to have clear convictions, and so Knudson specialized in Old Testament. He accepted the moderately liberal theology of his teachers, but wondered about its philosophical basis. Why should he reject naturalism? What was the truth about realism and idealism? "My epistemology and metaphysics were at loose ends," he later recalled. Feeling keenly his lack of a philosophical foundation, Knudson worried that his theology lacked a stable basis as a consequence. Thus he spent a year studying philosophy at the Boston University Graduate School under Borden Parker Bowne.8 It was an experience of conversion and fulfillment. Bowne's "magnetic influence" was enthralling to Knudson. Edgar Brightman later concurred that Bowne's dignified bearing, "his sheer power, his comprehensive grasp of philosophical issues, and his lucid exposition of personalism made him seem almost a superman."

Not only was there the stimulus that came from the keenest, profoundest, and most masterful mind I ever knew, but the content of the teaching met my need as nothing else had done.'19 Knudson's highest compliment for Bowne was, "He had a system. ... He worked out a comprehensive theory of reality and of the intellectual, moral and religious life." In Bowne's comprehensive theorizing Knudson found the systematic philosophical coherence that he craved.10 His life turned a corner; for Knudson, the academic year 1896-1897 was the year of enlightenment: "It brought me a mental relief and an intellectual illumination that may be described as akin to a redemptive experience." He and Bowne frequently went for long walks through the Fenway in Boston, discussing philosophical problems. Knudson told friends that upon returning from these conversations he often recalled the lines that Wordsworth wrote near Tintern Abbey: "I have felt a presence that disturbs me with the joy of elevated thoughts."11 Knudson was the blessed child, for Bowne rarely gave personal time to students. Though riveting in class, he had few words for students outside class; in two years, he spoke four sentences to Brightman. Knudson went on to study under Adolf von Harnack and Julius Kaftan in Berlin, but the titans of German theology proved underwhelming to him. He appreciated their learning and eminence, but found them uninspiring compared to Bowne.12 g"To an almost" and "on the most" Albert C.

Hinckley Mitchell, as Professor of Hebrew and Old Testament Exegesis at Boston University. Mitchell's appointment was terminated by the Methodist Episcopal Board of Bishops, and Knudson's preparation for his new position was late and rushed. He gave fifteen years to the field of Old Testament, and finally became the School of Theology 's theologian in 1921, after Henry Sheldon retired. Later Knudson regretted that it took so long for his theological career to begin. The school of personalist idealism was slow to develop as a consequence.1 ' The Religion of Personality: Edgar S. Brightman In many respects, Edgar S. Brightman was closer to the mold of his teacher. Brilliant, deeply pious and thoroughly academic, he surpassed even Bowne in his reverence for logic, and he gave much more time to his students. He was born in 1884 in Holbrook. Massachusetts, where his father was a Methodist pastor, and his mother taught him French and botany at an early age. Educated at Brown University, he read Josiah Royce and became a neo-Hegelian during his college years. Brightman's neo-Hegelian phase ended during his graduate school days at Brown, when William James's Pragmatism swept him away. But James was not the answer, either. Shortly before Brightman completed his master's degree in philosophy, in 1908, he discovered that a proposition can be perfectly useful and perfectly wrong. He dropped pragmatism and enrolled at the Boston University School of Theology, where he found his reward at the Graduate School, in Bowne's philosophy classroom.14 Brightman got to Boston just in time to find his masterthinker. He was enthralled by Bowne's scintillating performances and convinced by his arguments. In 1919 Knudson engineered Brightmans hiring as professor of philosophy at Boston University.

He took for granted that Bowne deserved a school, though he was mindful of the problems of schools. Bowne made permanent contributions to philosophy, Brightman believed, and he made them with inspiring conviction, but his prestige among many philosophers was not very high, and if his disciples were to extend his legacy w we must speak a language that they can understand and listen to with respect/' Brightman steeled himself for the taunt of being a mere follower: Anyone who is the follower of a master or of a tradition in philosophy will be conscious of the multitudes wagging their heads and crying, epigone, epigone. He replied that schools are the vehicles of progress in philosophy. The personalist school of Bowne, still struggling for birth, needed to be wary of the problems of schools, but it had every right "to be loyal to its own insights, to acknowledge, with pride and gratitude, its debt to Bowne, in short, to be a school/'15 Brightman had reasons to be optimistic that a major personalist school could be built. His own academic appointment was one of them, along with the books that he planned to write; Brightman poured out four books in the mid-1920s. From the beginning he attracted able students, notably Georgia Harkness. Another sign of a personalist renewal was the rising prominence of Francis McConnell as a church leader, bishop, and popular Christian writer. Another sign was the recent establishment of a quarterly journal, The Personalist, which published Brightman's calls for a movement-conscious personalist school. Founded and edited by Ralph Tyler Flewelling, The Personalist featured sophisticated philosophical articles and a warm Methodist spirit. Flewelling called Bowne "our master," his editorial column was addressed "To the Gentle Personalist," and he offered the following creed for the journal and movement: I believe in personality as the power of self consciousness and self-direction. I believe in personality as the World-ground, the ever-creative source of all things, immanent yet transcendent. I believe in 15 Edgar S.

I believe that human personality is fully realized only as it comprehends and gives itself to the will of the Infinite Personality, or God, 'in whom we live, and move, and have our being.'16 Knudson and the Philosophy of Personalism Upon beginning his career as a theologian, Knudson made it clear that personalist theology as he conceived it belonged to the tradition of Schleiermacher and Ritschl. With Schleiermacher he affirmed that theology must be a scientific explication of Christian experience or consciousness. With Ritschl he affirmed that the Christian experience of revelation is both the ground and norm of Christian truth.17 Knudson gave no quarter to conservative claims that he had to choose between the liberal tradition and John Wesley. He countered that liberal theology as a whole amounts to a logical development of the experience-based empirical principle on which the Wesleyan tradition rests. In good liberal theology, he explained, as in Methodism, experience serves an apologetic function and a normative one. Experience is the wellspring of religious claims and the basis on w hich Christians rightly defend their claims. Bowne's maxim was exactly right: personality (experience) is the key to reality and life (experience) is the test of truth. Knowledge is the comprehension of experience. Bowne's position was empirical in its focus on experience, but it was 16 Brightman, "Why is Personalism Unpopular?/' 534; Edgar S. Brightman to Georgia Harkness, October 4, 1922, Edgar S.

The interpretive key and link to the real is the immediate living experience of a self, he argued, not sense experience, and not abstract logic. Knudson proposed to revise liberal theology in a way that built upon Bowne?s insight. He carried out this project in a way that heightened the transcendental aspect of transcendental empiricism.18 In 1927, Knudson published a movement-work titled The Philosophy of Personalism that charted the relation of personalist idealism to other modern philosophies and argued for its superiority as a philosophical companion to Christianity. Modern theology was in a bad way, he believed. Compared to the "intellectual depth and power" that theological liberalism possessed in the nineteenth century, the current scene was dreadfully depressing. Theologians were confused about the fundamentals of their worldview and inclined to chase after pathetic fads: "Much of current theology as well as philosophy has run into the shallows." Especially pathetic was the fact that "not a little of the advanced theological thinking of the day seems to be linking itself up with a crude realism, dualism, pragmatism, or positivism." The liberal theologians at Chicago and Yale were intellectually bankrupt and the Barthians were even worse. The result for theology was "a deplorable confusion of thought," Knudson argued: "Nothing at present is more needed in the field of religious thought than a revival of metaphysical theology." Both theology and philosophy needed to regain the courage to struggle with metaphysical problems.19 The personalist answer was very old and variously conceived. Philosophically it began with Augustine, who professed that he desired to know God and the soul, "these and nothing more." Augustinian Christianity explicitly thematized the inklings of Greek philosophy and the Bible that the real things in life are personal souls and the personal God. In modern times, the attempt to interpret reality in personal terms took a variety of forms in post-Kantian and neo-Hegelian philosophy. The fundamental postulate of personalist philosophy is the reality of the self or soul. A personalist can deny the existence of a 18Ibid., quotes, 136, 137; see Albert C. Knudson, "Bowne as Teacher and Author," The Personalist 1 (July 1920), 5-14. ig Albert C.

Against David Hume's dissolution of the self into a bundle of perceptions and the pantheist reduction of the self to a phase of divine activity, Bowne and his followers asserted the metaphysical reality of the self or soul, but not as a substance. Popular piety conceives the soul as a material substance; Plato conceived it as an immaterial substance; Descartes conceived it as a thinking substance; the personalists countered that they accepted the modern axiom that activity is essential to being. Ancient and medieval thought made the idea of substance more fundamental than that of cause, but modern consciousness denies reality to forms of existence that lack the power of action. Thus Leibniz conceived the soul as the spiritual cause of material phenomena; Berkeley conceived it as the perceiving activity that creates ideas and the world of things; Kant theorized that the mind is creative, building up its world for itself by virtue of immanent principles or categories of thought.21 Here as elsewhere, for the personalists, Kant was the hero and the goat of modern philosophy. For centuries philosophers took for granted that human subjects receive impressions from without. The schools of philosophy differed over the nature of the external stimulus in sense experience, but they agreed that in the realm of reason, human subjects either read off whatever is implicit in sense experience or they bring to consciousness whatever is innate in the mind. Sense perception was linked to a realistic view of the external world. Berkeley cracked 20 See J. M. E.

To the personalists. this was the key to Kant's greatness. It was Kant who theorized that the individual mind is a determining factor in the production of experience. Kant dethroned the ultimacy of sense experience in favor of reason and the higher spiritual interests.22 In Kantian philosophy, persons are moral ends-in-themselves. and the things of sense are subordinate to the powers of mind. If sensations are thought-products that lack any definite character until they are fashioned into being by the creative powers of mind, then the things of sense have no claim to primacy in human life and thought. Bowne told his classes that this insight was Kant's permanent contribution to philosophy. Knudson argued that because of Kant's critical achievement, rationality and the higher spiritual interests had no reason to fear "the aggression of sense." The higher things were securely enthroned in Kant's critical idealism.2" But there was also the bad Kant who marred his own magnificent achievement by ruling out any knowledge of transcendental ?things-in-themselves," including knowledge of human souls. Kant couldn't get along without a knowable soul and thus he replaced it with poor substitutes. He called these replacements the empirical ego, which is bound by causation; and the transcendental unity of apperception, which is a logical point of reference; and the ego as a thing-in-itself, which is unknowable; and the ego as a transcendental ideal, which is the goal of knowledge; and the moral ego, which posits its own freedom. In the name of epistemological rigor and modesty Kant thus ended up with five egos. The personalists shook their heads: this was a terrible confusion. Unfortunately, this confusion was deeply insinuated in modern theology.24 The personalists called for a liberal Protestantism that dared to assert the reality of the soul as a knowable first principle, though not as 22Ibid., quotes, 131; see George Berkeley, A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710; Open Court edition, LaSalle, EL: Open Court, 1986). 23Bowne, Personalism, 56; Knudson, The Philosophy of Personalism, 130-134, quote, 131. 24 Knudson, The Philosophy of Personalism, 72-74; Eugene W.

With Descartes, they defined the soul as the integral reality known to, and as, consciousness. The personalists chenshed Descartes for contending that the existence of the soul is immediate and certain, while that of matter is an uncertain inference. On the other hand, Descartes's absolute dualism of body and soul was impossible. He viewed the body as an automaton and the soul as a purely thinking substance. The personalists countered that the knowing agent and the agent's activity are one. There is consciousness without a subject, no thought without a thinker, no activity without an agent." The soul bears the "stamp of reality" by its consciousness of its unity and self identity. 25 With Kant the personalists maintained that the categories of thought are the preconditions of experience that make experience possible; they cannot be imported into the mind from without. Against Kant they insisted that if the categories of thought do not apply to things-in-themselves, then these things cannot be affirmed at all. Kant distinguished sharply between knowledge and faith, a dichotomy that Ritschlian theologians eagerly accepted, but the personalists countered that in real life the line of distinction between knowledge and faith is not nearly so sharp. Knowledge is not limited to the phenomenal world, they explained; theoretical reason always employs faith assumptions of its own; theoretical reason cannot completely dispense with metaphysical categories; science is not value-free; purpose is constitutive in thought; and the idea of a good to be attained is constitutive in purpose.26 To those who objected that personalist theory was too systematic, rationalized, and sharply defined, the personalists replied that serious philosophical thinking is systematic, rationalized, and sharply defined. There is no middle ground to be claimed between a mechanistic and a personalist worldview. William James and Ralph Barton Perry argued that personalism was a concoction of compromises between rival systems lacking a strong center of its own; Knudson replied that personalism was, indeed, a mediating philosophy and that 25Knudson, The Philosophy of Personalism, 73-74, 141-142, quote, 74. 20Borden Parker Bowne, Theory of Thought and Knowledge (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1897); Bowne, Kant and Spencer: A Critical Exposition (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1912); Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Discourse on Metaphysics; Correspondence with Arnauld; Monadology, trans.

Skeptics denied that personality is metaphysically real, usually on the ground that the "self is a composite with no metaphysical glue that binds together its states of consciousness; Knudson replied that the human eye does not see itself, either, and yet without the eye nothing can be seen. The same thing is true of the self. To say that the self is real is not to claim that it manifests itself to consciousness as a distinct object. It is to say that the self is a special kind of object, different from the things of sense, which is given immediately in experience. We cannot escape this experience; we assume its existence even when we try to analyze it away. Knudson's clincher was inspired by Augustine: it would be impossible to deny the existence of a self if a self did not exist to make the denial.27 In 1926 Knudson became dean of the School of Theology, just as the personalist school was becoming a significant intellectual movement. During his tenure the seminary's reputation rose nearly to the level of Union and Chicago, American Methodist pastors learned to speak the language of religious personalism, and thus Boston University kept alive a vital stream of progressive theological discourse during a period when liberalism lost its movement glow. Brightman and the Truth of Religion nudson was the School's theologian and party leader. Brightman was the school's philosopher, but not a partisan leader; he cherished his intellectual independence too much for that role. Each was a close friend and intellectual ally to the other. Both were renowned among colleagues and students for their enormous energy and disciplined productivity. Knudson maintained a grueling schedule of administrative tasks, teaching and scholarship that nearly ruined his health in the mid-1930s. Aided by constantly updated index cards, Brightman faithfully corresponded with a staggering list of friends and former students; his precise appointment-walks were legendary among students. He assumed leadership roles in several professional 27Knudson, The Philosophy of Personalism, 418-425; Bowne quoted in James T.

Knudson was the more approachable personality; friends and students called him "Knoody." Brightman was courtly-mannered, dauntingly brilliant, and usually serious, though he possessed a sharp sense of humor. Even behind his back students didn't call him Edgar. Both were logical drillmasters in the classroom. Though Knudson made friends more readily, both were revered by their students. Knudson inherited the essentials of his position from Bowne and expounded this position philosophically and theologically for the rest of his career. He added one major plank to the personalist platform?religious a priorism?but his creative contributions to personalism were in the areas of philosophical cartography and theological application, not philosophical rethinking 28 Brightman was a different kind of thinker. He began his career as a down-the-line disciple of Bowne s, but in mid-career he became a more independent disciple, while still revering his teacher. In mid career he broke with Bowne's classical theism on the doctrine of divine omnipotence; shortly afterward he rejected Bowne's idealistic doctrine of divine nontemporality; soon after he decided that Bowne s theory of personality was short on psychological facts. For many years he worked on his own theory of personality, convinced that Bowne's theory of the self still smacked of substantialist metaphysical glue; Brightman's last name for his idea of the unitary self was Cvthe shining present."29 The fact that he was more inclined than Knudson to range outside the boundaries of Bowne? s system was a strength of the Boston School. Brightman reduced the party-line feeling of Boston personalism. On his initiative personalists vigorously debated the finitude of God, and whether time has an effect on God, and whether personalists should be temporalists, and what it means to make conscious experience the point of departure for philosophy. Bowne took the eternalist position that time is not metaphysically real, but 28Edgar S. Brightman to Albert C. Knudson, December 26, 1952, Edgar S. Brightman Collection. See Paul E.

Personality is active, free, and purposive, he reasoned, and these qualities all require time. On this issue he found personalist allies; on other issues he had to make allies among his students/0 Brightman's early books took a very light pass at the problem of evil, befitting his belief that ideals disclose the structure of the real. He reasoned that the problem of evil is like that of the relation between mind and body. It has "unexplained facts" that need the demystifying attention of logic and science. But Brightman felt the tragedy of life more deeply than his early books conveyed, and his interest in evolutionary science heightened his personal doubts about the credibility of classical theism. Evolutionary science presents a grim picture of evils that serve no good purpose, he reflected. In the late 1920s he stopped avoiding the theodicy question. Is the existence of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God the best hypothesis that one can make in the light of empirical evidence? Brightman was committed to the notion that God is good; what he could not figure was how the evolutionary picture of a world pervaded by meaningless evil could be reconciled with the classical view of God as all-good and all-powerful. Reluctantly he moved to the judgment that God's omnibenevolence can be upheld only by giving up the notion of divine omnipotence. The Problem of God (1930) was his break-out book. It propounded the theory of a finite God, which, until this time, was associated with near Christian thinkers such as William James and H. G. Wells.31 ^Brightman, "Bowne: Eternalist or Temporalist," 258; Ralph Tyler Flewelling, Bergson and Personal Realism (New York: Abingdon Press, 1920), 230; Brightman, "Religion as Truth," 53; see Peter A.

Francis McConnell argued that God is constrained by certain inner limitations, but that God is not limited in power. Brightman countered that defending God"s goodness was more important than saving classical theism. He pressed four arguments toward the verdict that God is a conflicted finite being: First, that evolution is stunningly wasteful and violent; second, that God s nature as a conscious being and God's granting of free will to human beings set limits to God's will; third, that God's nature is not merely goodness but also dialectical struggle, characterized by the same dynamic of assertion and negation that pervades all reality; and fourth, that God is perfect in will, but not in achievement/2 These arguments melded into a single thesis: Given the facts that we possess about the suffering-causing evils of the world that far exceed moral guilt or moral use, we must revise either the classical view of God's goodness or God's power. Brightman argued plainly for the latter. Since God is loving and good, God would eliminate the evils that persons are not responsible for if God were able to do so, but God is evidently not able to do so. A nonrational "Given" in God's consciousness apparently thwarts God's capacity to achieve the divine purpose. God attains goodness only after a struggle with "Given" limiting factors that inhere in the divine being. Determined to explain the existence of evils that a good God did not create or will, and taking for granted that God's goodness cannot be compromised without falling into atheism, Brightman resorted to the idea of a God whose power is limited by coeternal nonrational elements within the divine being that oppose God's rational divine will. In other words, God is limited by "Given" factors in God's nature that God did not create. Brightman accepted McConnell's sanction against outside limitations on God, but he pressed the thesis of inner limitation to the point of positing a disabling conflict within God's being. Boldly he told mainline Christians not to fear the notion that God is finite, though he later preferred the formulation that God is a finite-infinite Being. The power of God's will is limited, he reasoned, but God is infinite in time, goodness, and love.

The book was widely reviewed, often condemned, and vigorously debated. The Persona list rejected Brightman* s concept of the Given as the kind of solution that only makes the problem worse. Flewelling blasted Brightman's claim that God lacks full power over evil. Are the restrictions within God's nature according to God's will, he asked? Are these restrictions determining? If God is self-limited, then God must be held morally responsible for the defeat and obstruction of God's will. If God is not self-limited, then the Given is a power beyond God's control that controls God. The Given is either God's unacceptable servant or God's Frankenstein.^ Brightman's position was equally vulnerable to the charge of metaphysical dualism. He claimed to uphold the faith that God is the Lord of all creation, but his notion of a duality within the divine consciousness drove personalist theism to the edge of outright metaphysical dualism. Brightman allowed as much: The pertinent choice was between his near-dualism and the old God-and-Satan dualism, he argued. Since the old view of divine sovereignty is out and the old God-and-Satan dualism is equally incredible, modern religious thinkers were best advised to stop holding out for the God of classical theism. Some model of a finite God is the only morally acceptable solution, and at least his model preserved other attributes of divine infinity.34 Logical coherence is the sole criterion of truth; religious experience furnishes data for truth about religion; and all truth is hypothetical. These were Brightman's ruling methodological axioms. There is no such thing as a good theology that is not rigorously logical, he insisted, yet logic is no substitute for experience. He honored religious experience wherever he found it; if religious experience furnishes the data for truth about religion, Brightman argued, then Christian thinkers must be open to the truth in non-Christian religions. Though he wrote very little on these subjects, Brightman studied the classic texts of Western and Eastern mysticism, he claimed special kinships with Jews, Buddhists, and Muslims, and in his later years he 33 Ralph Tyler Flewelling, tcNotes and Discussions: The Problem of God," The Personalist 11 (October 1930), 275-279. 34 Edgar S.

Religiously, Brightman felt spiritually linked to all who devoted themselves to a superhuman order of reality and value; philosophically, he pursued the question of what it means to say that personality is the key to reality. He distinguished personalism from skepticism, which denies that there is a key to reality; and from dogmatism, which appeals to outside authority; and from appeals to subpersonal principles like matter or energy, which cannot account for the phenomenon of consciousness; and from the kind of superpersonal principles featured in mystical theology, which are too vague and undefinable to explain anything. To Brightman, personalism was the view that personality unites and explains everything else in life. Emphatically he objected to the common impression that personalists identify the real with the human; in his view, the real was a complex of selves or an episode in the experience of a cosmic self.3s He defined personality' as a self-conscious unity of self experience. A person is a conscious unity. For Brightman, to say that the self is a conscious unity excluded any sort of union with anything that is not the self s consciousness. Put differently, the self has a body, but the self is not a body, "not even in part." It is not a part or process of the body. Brightman had enough interest in his body to follow an exercise regime of swimming and walking, but he wanted no part of his body to be identified with him. Whatever one remembers to be part of the unity of one's consciousness is part of oneself, he reasoned; whatever does not fall within the unity of one's consciousness is not part of oneself /6 Skeptics question how one can know that there is such a thing as a person. Brightman gave the Augustinian/Cartesian answer, that in his immediate experience he found that he is such a being: 'i find myself; I do not invent myself I am experience." Experience contains immediacy (the presence of feelings, relations within the given) and references beyond immediacy (memories, things, relations beyond the given). Through memory and anticipation, the self experienced in immediacy links itself to a past self and a future self, while reason judges the claims of both memory and anticipation. Thus, as a 35Edgar S. Brightman, "Personality as a Metaphysical Principle," Personalism in Theology: A Symposium In Honor of Albert Cornelius Knudson, 40-63, quote, 43. 36Ibid.,44,45.</page><page sequence="22">Vol. 24, No. 3, September 2003 235 subjective fact, the self is self-known as a rationally remembered and anticipated unity of consciousness/7 But the self is more than a subjective fact. Brightmans disembodied personality only seemed Cartesian, for he emphasized that the self is not merely a unit of reflective self-experience. It is always interacting with something that is not itself; it can be known from within and from without. Introspection is a teacher, but so is empirical observation. Both are necessary to the making of a self. Personalist philosophy thus shared common ground with psychology; on the other hand, the metaphysical reality named "personality" is prior to and more than the self studied in psychology. It is the presupposition and agent of all science and experience. Psychology does not ask whether personality is the key to reality. Personalist philosophy affirmed that personality is cosmomorphic, not anthropomorphic. Brightman observed that even though space is found in human experience, everyone agrees that space is cosmomorphic. Everyone attributes cosmomorphic status to time and mathematics as well; Plato taught that God geometrizes. If space and time and mathematics are rightly regarded as cosmomorphic, Brightman argued, is it not possible that the principle of personality, which also is found in human experience, is a universal and cosmic principle? Against the charge that personalists interpreted the universe in personal terms, making God in the image of human beings, Brightman countered that it was more reasonable to conclude that God made human beings in God's image. If human beings do not contain clues to objective reality, then science is impossible.38 If personality is real, it is a first principle more fundamental than space or time or mathematics, for space and time and mathematics all require personality to be experienced. Personality is the unifying principle. Its certainty is secured by the fact that the reality of everything else depends upon it. Without personality, Brightman argued, space, time, and mathematics would be meaningless. The great cosmic truths would disintegrate into shards of vanishing experience. Personality does not require space, but space, time, and number are attributes of personality /9 With Schopenhauer, Brightman believed that 37 Ibid., 45-46. ^Ibid., 46-54; see Edgar S.

His empirical-personalistic method conformed to logical norms while standing before the court of experience. The test of any hypothesis is whether it makes systematic coherence out of experience. Against Bowne's claim that time has no ontological reality. Brightman judged that Bowne's eternalism was a hangover from Platonist Christianity. In his view, personalists needed to be temporalists because freedom, activity, and purpose all require time. Though Brightman believed that God is never less than a person ontologically, he denied that God is supertemporally eternal. Nothing real is static, he explained: "The real endures; the real changes; the real grows. God is the real or at least the most significant part of the real. " God's traits have such names as energy, creative process, concentration, integration, and will. Put differently, God is not a timeless being; God s existence "is an eternally changing present." These arguments had a significant future in American liberal theology, but mostly under the influence of a rival theological school.40 To his dismay, Brightman lived to see the organicist panentheism of the Whiteheadian school overtake personalist idealism as a leading force in liberal theology. Knudson and the Rule of Faith Albert Knudson had a keen sense of living in dismal times, theologically. Though liberalism conquered the field of theology during his lifetime, he took little satisfaction from its professional success. He took it as a personal mission to rescue liberal theology from shallow reasoning and cultural fads. His feeling of urgency was fueled by his sense of the crisis of theology and the fact that he got a late start. His first volume of constructive theology, The Doctrine of God, which appeared in 1930, observed that modern theology wins little respect in modern thought because modern thought is anti-authoritarian and anti metaphysical. To Knudson these were very different kinds of problems. ^Brightman, "Bowne: Eternalist or Temporalist," 258-260, 264-265; Brightman, Person and Reality, 300-342, quotes, 323; Brightman, "A Temporalist View of God," The Journal of Religion 12 (1932), 545-555; Bertocci, "The Personalism of Edgar S. Brightman and Ultimate Reality," 41.</page><page sequence="24">Vol. 24, No. 3, September 2003 237 He embraced the modern rejection of authority religion, but he regarded the second problem as a prejudice that had to be resisted. "Authoritarianism belongs to the past. Progressive Protestant theology has set it aside," he pronounced. The first problem was a hangover from Christianity's long authoritarian past; it had no future. Implicitly, progressive Protestant theology simply needed to get the word out that it bowed to no external authority. The second problem was more disturbing. Throughout his career Bowne fought against philosophies that gave primacy to the things of sense, but Bowne lived at a time when neo-Hegelianism still ruled the field of philosophy. Knudson celebrated his connection to the broad currents of modern idealist philosophy, but he understood that the tide in philosophy had turned against metaphysical thinking. Modern thinkers looked down on theology because they presumed that theology is authoritarian and metaphysical. Many theologians dealt with the second problem in the same way that they dealt with the first, by cutting loose from metaphysical claims. 41 Knudson countered that no theology worthy of the name gives up the claim to metaphysical truth. "Metaphysics has to do with ultimate reality; it has to do with what [the word] 'God' stands for in religion," he admonished. Some theologians expounded the biblical doctrine of God without grounding their thinking in a philosophical worldview; they retained the metaphysical contents of religious speech without providing methodological warrants for their claims. Others abandoned all metaphysical claims for theology. Knudson judged that the former strategy was pitifully superficial and the second strategy amounted to theological suicide. Theology cannot renounce metaphysics "without ceasing to be theology," he insisted. The new schools of liberal theology would never save theology .42 Hegelian theologies took their stand on metaphysical reason; the school of Schleiermacher claimed that religious experience is its own self-authenticating ground. Knudson said yes to both. Faith and reason belong together, he insisted; neither can stand alone. He had immense faith in the power of metaphysical reason to rationalize and defend Christianity, but he saw no reason to cany out this project 41 Knudson, The Doctrine of God, 15. 42 Ibid., 15-16; see Albert C. Knudson, "The Theology of Crisis," Report of the Sixth Biennial Meeting of the Conference of Theological Seminaries in the United States and Canada Bulletin 6 (September 28, 1928), 52-77.</page><page sequence="25">238 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy without an immunized basis of faith on his side. Knudson called it the religious a priori, which grounded his claims for a God-relation and for the moral character of reality. Religion is self-standing and self authenticating, he argued; the idealizing process inherent in religion is structural in human reason. We cannot rationally deny value to reality, for rationality begins with an implicit faith in ideals. Knudson loved to quote John Wesley on the centrality of religious experience, but he quoted very selectively, and on other subjects he rarely quoted Wesley at all. Like Bowne, he believed that Methodist theology could become modern only by starting over. For reasons that he plainly expressed, he ignored the major theologians of the Methodist tradition. Commenting on the work of his major theological predecessors?English Methodists Richard Watson and William Burt Pope, and American Methodists Miner Raymond and John Miley?he allowed that they did "creditable work" in systematizing traditional Methodist doctrine: "But they were not creative thinkers, they introduced no new theological method, they were guided by no new organizing principle, they gave no new direction to theological thought." Therefore they had little relevance for the work of modern theology: "They reflected for the most part the authoritarian standpoint of the current traditional evangelicalism."4^ The Wesleyan elements that Knudson accepted were Wesley's emphasis on religious experience, his affirmation of free will, his emphasis on the personal and moral character of God, and, without identifying it as a specifically Wesleyan notion, the belief that theological affirmations should be based on four distinct sources of witness and information: scripture, tradition, reason, and experience. A generation after Knudson propounded a decidedly liberal version of the latter argument, Methodist theologian Albert C. Outler named it "the Wesleyan Quadrilateral."44 43 Albert C.

Knudson blasted various theologies to his left for shrinking the New Testament Christ and for abandoning the personal-supernatural God of Christianity. He was rough on the kind of historicism that stripped the New Testament Christ down to a liberal picture of the historical Jesus. Christianity was not founded on the person or religion of a non-divine historical Jesus, he insisted. The liberal histoncist dichotomy between the religion of Jesus and the religion about Jesus was wholly misleading, because it treated the Christian religion about a divine Jesus as a degenerate offshoot of Jesus' own gospel. Knudson admonished that Christianity was founded on the impression of divinity made by the personality of Jesus on his disciples; there is no Christianity apart from this impression. Modern theology cannot resort to something simpler without destroying the irreducible basis of Christianity.45 Knudson was equally opposed to the liberal drift away from classical theism. Naturalistic theologies appalled him. Chicago-school naturalism treated nature as metaphysically real and it viewed God as real only as a part or product of nature. By defining God as a law or process, the Chicago schoolers attributed reality to God in the sense that a law or social process is real. Knudson countered that the real God of Christianity is a supernatural Person who is metaphysically absolute and ethically perfect. The personalist affirmation of the metaphysical God of Christianity corrects one key aspect of classical theism, he allowed. Classical theism had a vague concept of personality and thus played up the reality of personality in God. Personalist theism was informed by the modern understanding of a person as an individual center of self-consciousness and by the demands of modern science for a unitary world ground; thus it emphasized the personality of God. Human personality is not a mirror of God's inner life, Knudson allowed; it is a symbol of God's personality. The divine personality transcends our comprehension, but something indispensably important to Christian faith is secured in the affirmation that God's personality is something like our own. To say that God is personal is to ascribe intelligence and freedom to God.

The Church Fathers had a vague conception of personality, they flirted with tritheism in defining the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as persons, they made a weak case for the personality of the Holy Spirit, their neo Platonist realism subordinated personality to essence, and they two sidedly identified the divine element in Christ with the Logos and with the ego of Jesus. The crucial word "person" is hopelessly problematic in Nicene Christianity, denoting a mode of being somewhere between a person and an attribute; moreover, modern people do not believe in the distinct Logos imagined by Greek philosophy. Modern theology affirms the existence of divine reason, but not as something detachable from the divine personality. Knudson preferred Schleiermacher on the divinity of Christ; what made Jesus different from other people was 'the constant potency of His God-consciousness, which was a veritable existence of God in Him."47 It followed that the idea of the trinity is a symbolic way of dramatizing the divine love. It does not stand in its own right, "but is dependent on faith in the Christlikeness of God."48 Personality and Spirit he personalists were in tune with the socio-ethical idealism of their A age. Though some were more ardent social gospelers than others, all of them had strong ethical concerns, and in the school's third generation, it became known especially for its pacifist/democratic socialist/integrationist social conscience under the leadership of Walter G. Muelder. The second generation personalists were remarkably successful not only in building a movement, but in sustaining it. In 1933, Walter Muelder earned his doctorate under Brightman; in 1934, S. Paul Schilling earned his doctorate under Brightman; in 1935, Peter Bertocci and L. Harold DeWolf earned their doctorates under Brightman. These thinkers kept personalism going strong for another 46Ibid., 203-241,285-324, quote, 300. 47Ibid., 370-428; Schleiermacher, The Christian Faith, quote, 385; see Knudson, Basic Issues in Christian Thought, 122-141. ^Knudson, The Doctrine of God, 418,427-428.</page><page sequence="28">Vol. 24, No. 3, September 2003 241 generation, while liberal theology declined as a whole, and Muelder made especially creative contributions to personalist theory. The third generation personalists had a strong social conscience, and they had a hand in giving Martin Luther King, Jr. to the world. In the third volume of my history of liberal theology, I will give detailed attention to their work and legacy. But the waning of personalist idealism as a theological school began during its third generation, because Muelder, DeWolf, and Schilling did not inspire intellectual successors, their creativity fell short of Brightman \ and the shortcomings of personalist thought caught up with them. Nearly every liberal Protestant theologian of the early and middle twentieth century appealed to personality as a virtual God-term, notably William Adams Brown, Henry Churchill King, Shailer Mathews, D. C. Macintosh, Harry Emerson Fosdick, Rufus Jones, and the early Reinhold Niebuhr. Personality-language fit the Victorian language of spirit overcoming nature that American liberal theology spoke from its birth. But the personalists convinced few progressives outside their school to invest as much importance as they did in a metaphysical theory of personality. Their long lists of universal moral laws made them seem quaint to many theologians, and their fixation on the golden key of personality isolated them w ithin American theology and philosophy, which gravitated toward non-speculative philosophies such as pragmatism, empiricism, language analysis, and existentialism. Though the conceptuality of personalist idealism was vigorously theistic, cosmic, and social-ethical, it was often caricatured as a philosophy of individualistic projection; though Brightman left room in his moral theory for the relativity of context, his preoccupation with universal laws was alienating to a contextualist-turning generation of theologians; though the Boston personalists formally rejected the idea of a dualistic bifurcation between persons and nature, their mind centered idealism was weak on the moral and metaphysical importance of embodiment, nature, and environmental concern. Brightman and Knudson divorced consciousness from embodiment, and neither of them thematized the dignity of nature. These weaknesses were magnified by the rise of Whiteheadian process theology, which offered an organicist, panpsychic/panphysicalist alternative to the personalist school's blend of Cartesian dualism and Kantian/Hegelian idealism. In the 1940s the theological followers of Whitehead and Charles</page><page sequence="29">242 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Hartshorne became a serious rival to Boston personalism in the competition for speculatively-minded Christian influence; in the 1950s they became the stronger party . The second generation of Bownean personalists built an impressive theological school, but they did not change the direction of the theological field. They kept predicting that the field was about to turn in their direction, but it never did. To Knudson it was a point of pride that personalistic theology was rooted in nineteenth century idealism, but critics often repeated William James's objection that this was exactly the problem with personalism: it was a patchwork of idealisms, not an original philosophy. A later dean of the Boston University School of Theology, Robert Neville, emphasized this point in explaining why, in his view, personalism lacked persuasive force and staying power. Instead of analyzing the underlying implications of modernity in the original manner of James, Heidegger, Husserl, Wittgenstein, or Whitehead, Neville argued, the Bownean personalists reassembled the most attractive parts of an expiring German idealism. By implication, they might have done better by at least remaining up to date in their borrowings, but Knudson saw nothing worth appropriating in what he called "the popular naturalistic, skeptical, and so called empirical philosophies of the day ."49 For Knudson especially, the positivist turn in theology and philosophy was depressing. Compared to the spiritless generation that ruled theology and philosophy in the 1930s, the 1890s world of his youth seemed like a golden age. Knudson longed to see another age of its kind in his lifetime. While Brightman called for wider forms of interreligious dialogue and a new philosophy of world religions, Knudson deepened the Kantian basis of his thinking. While Brightman continued to revise the metaphysical commitments that he took from Bowne and Hegel, Knudson contended that Bowne had already solved the perennial problems of philosophy. In the 1950s, DeWolf and Muelder kept alive the work of Knudson and Brightman, but after them, no one kept alive the thinking of DeWolf and Muelder. The third generation personalists had the unenviable task of refashioning German idealism after it had fallen out of fashion. They were creative and productive stewards of their tradition, but their fourth-generation 49Knudson, fctA Personalistic Approach to Theology," 240; Robert Neville, Review o?'

Personalism conjured a Supreme Person as its ultimate and even described this ultimate as a Supreme Being. It was a theology of spiritual personality, but it might have worked better as a theology of personal spirit. Instead of defining the spiritual in terms of the personal and the moral, the personalists would have done better to follow the later-life example of Paul Tillich, who relinquished the language of being in favor of a theology of "concrete spirit,'' or neo-personalist theologian Neis F. S. Ferr?, who defined personality and morality in terms of the spiritual. Spirit is a more fluid and inclusive category than personality, and thus it is less enmeshed than personality in the problems of Western substantialist philosophy (though not as free of these problems as Ferr? believed). Tillich's third volume of his Systematic Theology and his last lectures on the theology of religions interpreted experiences of the Holy as expressions of universal Spirit. From a standpoint closely linked to the personalist school, Ferr? criticized the provincialization of Christianity in phrases that closely resembled Tillich's last writings and lectures. Constructively, Ferr? argued that God is creative and personal Spirit, motivated by love; that the Incarnate Word is the God of personal love and the all-inclusive Spirit; that love is the final meaning of spirit and the personal; that eternity is the life of divine love; that being is not the ultimate, either as substance or process; and that spirit is the most inclusive and universal ultimate. Ferr? cnticized various personalists for their commitment to a separate Personality concept of God, but personal ist theory was and is not impervious to revision on this theme or others related to it. Personalist idealism is conceivable as the theology of universal Spint that Tillich and Ferr? differently imagined in their last years, and as such, it could attract future generations.50 50 See Paul Tillich, Systematic Theology, Vol. 3 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963); Tillich, Christianity and the Encounter of World Religions (New York: Columbia University Press, 1963); Tillich, "The Significance of the History of</page><page sequence="31">244 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Religions for the Systematic Theologian," The Future of Religions, ed.
