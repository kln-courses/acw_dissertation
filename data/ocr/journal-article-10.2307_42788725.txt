<plain_text><page sequence="1">REMINISCENCES OF AN «LOE ENTHUSIAST What decided me to monograph the Aloes of South Africa? That is a long story. The decision was reached only after I had accumulated a large number of photo- graphs and much data, and realised there was a need for such a book. Some twenty years ago my first Aloe (which happened to be A. peglerae) was collected near Pretoria. I brought it home, half buried the plant in the ground, swamped it with water - and it promptly died. I wanted to know why. Later, I learnt that most Aloes grow on top of the ground not in it. It was only when Aloes were rested on top of the ground, on a well-drained slope, that they grew and flowered. Gradually a large collection of Aloes from most parts of the Union was built up, and I wanted to know their correct names and relationship, photograph them and study them. Aloes are an acquired taste, they have a peculiar fascination all their own. Never having enjoyed a botanical training I wanted to know something about affinities, grouping, classifica- tion and nomenclature in general, but there was no English book available giving the desired information about our South African Aloes. The Division of Botany, Pretoria, and also the Bolus Herbarium and National Botanic Gardens, Cape Town, extended every assistance in the naming of the material, but unknown to me, I had collected species which were new to science, and un- described. The last published revision of the Aloes was that of Berger in Das Pflanzenreich published in 1908. The descriptions were in Latin with the text in German. This all had to be translated and filed. I then decided to try and master the subject, and perhaps one day be able to publish a book which would make readily available for others, the information I had eagerly sought for myself. It then became necessary to study all available litera- ture from the earliest days, and try to disentangle what had been recorded about our Aloes. The first task was to accumulate photographs of the title-page, pages of text and figures, from Dodonaeus Stirpium Historiae (1583) onwards. These photographs were mounted in albums in chronological sequence, and have proved an invaluable set of records for quick reference. They have enabled me, among other things, to include pre-Linnean (i.e. before 1753) citations with the synonomy of all the oldest known species. With their aid I have also been able to reproduce many of the earliest published illustrations of Aloes. Doing all this led me along unexpected paths. I found, for instance, that the common Cape "Suikerbos" (Prótea mellifera ) had been illustrated as far back as 1605 in Clusius Exoticorum , while five other Cape plants, including a Watsonia and a "Chink" were illustrated in Swertius Florilegium in 1612. This is all the more inter- esting when one realises that Van Riebeeck never landed at the Cape, and founded the first European settlement there, until 1652. These investigations led to others, until I had accumu- lated so much data that I decided to enlarge the scope and include introductory chapters dealing with early history, place names, maps, expeditions and journeys, famous travellers and botanists, etc. This research was done with Aloe- seeing eyes only, and with a view to building up the complete Aloe picture as it exists today. It might be mentioned, in passing, that coloured drawings of four Aloes were done during Simon van der Stel's expedition to Namaqualand in 1685-86. Copies in colour, based on those originals can be seen today in the South African Museum, and the South African Public Library, Cape Town. Then came the necessity for accurate descriptions and Nat. Cart , &amp; Succ. Journal, June 1967, Vol. 22/2 p. 41 illustrations of all known species of Aloe in South Africa, wherever they grew. It was necessary to ascertain where they grew and when they flowered. I have always believed that "the picture tells the story" and that one good illustration is worth more than many pages of cold print. I then decided to photograph every Aloe pos- sible the length and breadth of the land, and write up descriptions on the spot. Extensive explorations and travels extended over many years and involved travelling considerably over 100,000 miles, from the mountains of Basutoland to the Desert, and from ocean to ocean, in every corner of South Africa, but it made possible the illustrating in black and white of the 132 species, almost all of them in their natural surroundings together with their individual flowers, natural size. For the latter, I used plate glass to eliminate the shadows, and then, for effect, the final halftone blocks were deep-etched. Many of the flowers so photographed were done in the veld, and if a wind was blowing I used an adhesive and stuck the flowers on to the glass. (Isn't it amazing how the wind comes up the minute one wants to put some specimens into a press ?) At a later stage the possibility of including "just a few" colour plates arose, so the entire Union was covered again, some localities several times. Different cameras, and various makes of colour film were used, but dis- appointments were many. Processing was then rarely carefully done, and results were often unsatisfactory for the colour-block making. That applies to overseas firms as well as South African. Eventually, in desperation, I imported a "One Shot" camera costing over £300. With this type of camera, balanced for daylight, three separate films are exposed simultaneously, i.e. one through a red (A) filter, one through a green (B) filter, and one through a blue (C5). The three-colour separations are thus made in one shot on the spot, but there were more snags to be over- come-mostly from colour-block makers. So once again the Union was covered from ocean to ocean, with the One Shot camera, seeking suitable material for colour plates. Eventually, by using some "One Shots" and some transparencies, it was possible to include the 77 colour plates now found in the book. Few realise the difficulties experienced in obtaining good exposures, and still fewer know just how much time and care are given by the colour etchers and block makers to get the best possible colours in the finished plate. Reproducing a colour drawing or painting presents little difficulty since the work is done in a studio with light of controlled colour temperature. Outdoors, dealing with a living plant, one has to cope with wind, and anything from heavy overcast to clear, sunny, blue sky. Further, light values vary from hour to hour, and also as to whether the camera faces north, south, east or west. There have been many disappointments, many failures, and much gnashing of teeth. On occasions, to fill in a gap, I have journeyed hundreds of miles in the hopes of securing a photograph, only to find it was raining or there was a heavy overcast sky and no sun, or blowing a gale, or there had been a veld-fire. It if happened to be a fine, sunny day, then plants had perversely flowered earlier or later than usual that particular year. For the 77 plates in the book, there were at least four times that number of failures. One of the most difficult colour plates to obtain was that of A. poly phy Ila, high up near the top of Phurumela Mountain, 30 miles east of Masera in Basutoland. Five times I climbed that mountain before obtaining the shot needed. To reach the particular spot, one can travel by car - over the bare rock of the mountain top in one place - but</page><page sequence="2">REPRINTED FROM VOLUME SEVEN OF THE JOURNAL AS A TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF THE AUTHOR, G.

On the first occasion, since I was more at home with my feet on the clutch pedal and foot brake than in stirrups, I asked for a nice, quite, docile Basuto pony, and safely mounted (but not for long) we set off. I managed fairly well until we came to a stream when I all but slid down the pony's neck - how was I to know it wanted a drink? On the way back the pony seemed to be somewhat in a hurry and I seemed to be coming down just as the pony was coming up. Later I found that there are times when partaking of meals is more comfortable in a standing position. Once, in the mountains near Barkly East, I found a bridge had been washed away, so decided to try to cross the stream at the old wagon drift. After wading across and back, to be sure of a safe depth, I started across. All went well until the car was only a few feet from the far bank, when the left rear wheel began sinking in a quicksand, and kept on sinking until only the bottom of the rear window was above water. It took 18 oxen to drag the car out and when safely out, instead of halting as respectable oxen should do, they careered across the veld dragging the car over the top of sundry rocks. When they finally stopped, and I tried to start the car, I found that THE PINNACLE near GRAKOP, EASTERN TRANSVAAL. ALOE NUBIGENA growing on precipice faces marked with white crosses. the gear box had been cracked open. In moments such as these, I believe one may be pardoned for exclaiming perhaps heatedly, "Dear me, this is provoking" - or words to that effect. (The Greeks have a word for it.) On one occasion I arrived at a certain small roadside hotel after dark, and booked in. I had the worst possible dirty old torn jacket and slouch hat on, and being too impatient to wait unťl morning to try to find where A, humilis grew, I walked out of the hotel with a torch, sack, and small pick in my hands. I returned near mid- night, having found what I sought, and slept soundly, leaving early next morning. It was not until I revisited the place a few months later that I was informed that the proprietor and his wife had spent a most anxious evening. They considered I could be up to no good with a pick, torch, and sack late at night, and concluded I must be a typical Johannesburg criminal, so their wardrobe had bfcen&amp;pushed up against the interleading door, and the öM man had kept a shot gun handy all night. They had beeîf relieved to see the last of me after breakfast. When I explained the real purpose of my previous visit, they looked at me with incredulous eyes. Being an amateur, and not a professional botanist, has its advantages, and I have been able to approach the subject unfettered by prejudices. Not having been born with a silver spoon in my mouth, and having to earn my living - whether I like it or not - has involved having to do two whole-time jobs at once, by working faster and cutting down sleep. It has meant that speed was of paramount importance. Obstacles had to be ruthlessly brushed aside. There was no time for illnesses. So much depends on one's state of mind and mental attitude. As far as one's body is concerned I firmly believe that the best thing to do is to feed it, clothe it, wash it - and forget it. Trips to secure data and photographs had to be planned to occupy the least possible time, and the car was frequently pushed to the limit of its capacity. As an example, on one occasion, in order to secure material for a colour plate of A. thraskii, I left Johannesburg at 8 a.m., and arrived at Isipingo Beach, south of Durban (420 miles) at 6 p.m. Next morning ^photographed A. thraskii and left at 9 a.m. for home, arriving at 7 p.m. Many trips had to organised at speed, since I could not leave my optical business for long. One of the memorable trips was a round-the-Union dash in July, 1948. On that occasion I had the good fortune to have a true lover of South Africa and its flora, Dr. N. R. Smuts, as my companion, and we travelled hard and fast. Westwards we sped to Upington, Keimoes (where magnificent flowering specimens of A. dichotoma occur) Springbok and Port Nolloth, a thousand miles away, on the Atlantic. From Port Nolloth northwards to Grootderm and Hells Kloof we continued, and at long last I secured colour plates of rare Aloes in those regions which had been missed on previous journeys. We returned to Port Nolloth, and drove southwards to Kleinsee to photograph A. arenicola , and thereby hangs a tale. Only one plant of A. arenicola , with flowers, was found growing amidst dried brush- wood. I instructed our "boy" to be extra careful not to damage the flowers when clearing the twigs away, but when I looked up after unpacking the cameras, lo and behold the flower spike had been broken in two. It was exasperating after having travelled so far. I must have said something suitable to the occasion, since I noticed Dr. Smuts walking discreetly away with his fingers pressed to his ears. However, with the aid of a match, the pe- duncle was "repaired" and remained erect just long enough for me to get a colour shot of it. Proceeding via breath-taking Spektakel Pass to Spring- Not.

Journal, June 1967, Vol. 22/2 p. 43</page><page sequence="4">bok, we continued southwards to Khamieskroon for A. khamiesensis , and on to Cape Town in the hopes of getting A. succotrina. Three previous visits had been fruitless, but on this occasion plants were flowering well at the very summit of the Karbonkelberg, near Hout Bay, and I secured a grand colour shot in clear sunlight. At long last the Aloes book would contain a colour plate of A. succotrina in its natural home - so I thought. We hurried over to Paarl and Du Toiťs Kloof, where I spotted a lovely early-flowering specimen of the unique "Fan Aloe" A. plicatilis. This was duly photographed with the One Shot camera, but when I tried to replace one of the slides, I found to my horror that I had in- advertently pulled out the back slide, and not the front one, and by doing so had ruined the lovely shot of A. succotrina . So we turned back and slept at Hout Bay. It rained all night, and not withstanding heavy rain in the morning, way up to the summit of Karbonkelberg we went again, the fifth time for me. The rain continued and when, after some hours of waiting in the rain, there was no hope of the weather clearing, I had to abandon it. And that is the reason why no colour plate of this classical species, so swathed in history, in included in the book. LISBON FALLS - an Aloe locality six miles north of Graskop, Eastern Transvaal. From Cape Town, Dr. Smuts and I journeyed to Worcester, Swellendam, Mossel Bay, Willowmore, Somerset East, Grahamstown, Umtata, Kokstad and Pietermaritzburg to Greytown and Muden, where countless thousands of A. mudenensis put up a glorious display of massed colours in July. From Muden we travelled to Dundee, Vryheid and Louwsburg, then home to Johannesburg. The trip of 4,000 miles was completed in 20 days, and was responsible for about 30 of the colour plates now included in the book. It was a "now or never" trip, but for once the weather was perfect throughout - except for Karbonkelberg and A. succotrina - and various species were flowering well. I made up for previous failures by ALOE SAUNDERSIAE, the world's smallest Aloe- 6 inches high. Nkandhla Mountain, Zululand. Hard to spot? It is. securing all but one of the colour plates I had hoped for, plus two I never expected. Every one of the 77 colour plates in the book has its story, but one cannot recount them all here. I have collected and photographed plants on a large number of farms throughout South Africa, and have always asked permission whenever a farmhouse was in sight. I have received the utmost help from farmers, in fact, a more kindly, lovable, and warm-hearted person than the average Afrikaner "backvelder" would be diffi- cult to meet. So, after many years of toil, and much burning of midnight oil, and often burning the candle at both ends, the 44 Aloes of South Africa" has at last seen the light of day. I am grateful to all who have helped in the task, and perhaps most of all to my wife who never complained, when left to care for herself and the children alone while I was away. She has been an unfailing source of encouragement and inspiration* and I am grateful. I am also grateful to th.e "Cape Times Ltd." for producing the book so well. The excellent printing and superb colour reproductions leave nothing to be desired and equal anything which can be produced overseas. I had the privilege of visiting their modernly equipped 9-acre factory at Parow, near Cape Town; it was an education, and an inspiration for the future. The "Fishes" book, now the 44 Aloes " book, the forthcoming "Mammals" book, and "The Wild Flowers of the Cape of Good Hope" will testify to the modern printing facilities now fortunately available to science in South Africa. It is no longer necessary to consider going overseas for the ultimate in modern printing and colour work. I have been asked whether I will now "rest on my laurels". The answer is: no so-called laurel is worth resting on. An anthropomorphic halo is a pretty useless thing, it has only to drop a few inches to become a noose. Besides (as my wife reminds me) only dead wood drifts down stream, and there is much more to do. Any plans for the future? Yes, at the moment I am toying with the idea of producing a book of Transvaal Wild Flowers, in which as many Transvaal flowering plants as possible will be illustrated in natural colours as they grow wild. Such lovely things as Streptocarpus , Dier ama, Water Lilies, Barberton Daisies, Watsonias , Crinums , Bruns- V eg ias, Ammo char is, Bauchinia , Erythrinas , not for- getting a few Aloes y lend themselves admirably to colour plate making. The wonderful wild flowers of the Cape have been abundantly popularised ; the time is opportune for similar treatment of the Transvaal's floral gems. PHOTOGRAPHS BY THE AUTHOR Nat. Cact. &amp; Succ.
