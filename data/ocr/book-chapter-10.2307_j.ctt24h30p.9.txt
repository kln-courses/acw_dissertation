Theorising about the Life Cycle of  IT Use: An appropriation perspective Justin Fidock  RMIT University Jennie Carroll  RMIT University Abstract This chapter argues that theorising about the whole life cycle of information  technology (IT) use is underdeveloped. Theories that explain one or more phases  of the life cycle of IT use are discussed and critiqued and a candidate theory  for understanding the whole life cycle identified: the model of technology  appropriation (MTA). The MTA incorporates many of the strengths of other  models but has a shortcoming with respect to explaining how and why changes  in patterns of use occur over the life cycle. To address this weakness, theories  of change are examined and incorporated with the MTA. It is argued that the  resulting model provides a more complete description and explanation of the IT  use life cycle. Introduction Understanding and predicting the use of information systems (IS) are two of  the central concerns for IS researchers and practitioners (Benbasat and Zmud,  2003; DeLone and McLean, 1992; Karahanna et al., 1999; McLean et al., 2002;  Trice and Treacy, 1988). A system that is under-utilised, misused or avoided  altogether will not achieve the intentions of its designers or those who have  procured the system. Given its centrality for both researchers and practitioners,  it is important to identify the ways in which researchers choose to theorise  about use. This is because the choice of theory influences what is included or  excluded from consideration. If a theory were not developed in the context of  examining the whole use life cycle then its ability to explain the whole would  likely be constrained. The central premise examined in this chapter is that  theorising about the whole life cycle of IT use is underdeveloped. An important  corollary of this premise is that understanding the life cycle as a whole will make  79 </page> <page sequence="4"> Information Systems Foundations: Theory building in information systems additional contributions to IS research and practice beyond those provided by  theory focused on only a portion of the life cycle. Furthermore, an enhanced  understanding of the life cycle will assist in identifying the limits of applicability  of partial views of the life cycle. In this chapter the life cycle of IT use is briefly described. Theories used to explain  use, and the life cycle of use more broadly, are then discussed and critiqued and  a candidate theory for understanding the whole life cycle identified: the model  of technology appropriation (MTA). The MTA is seen to incorporate many  of the strengths of the other models but is somewhat lacking with respect to  explaining the how and why of changes in patterns of use over the life cycle.  Additional theories or motors of change are therefore introduced—teleology,  dialectic and evolution—which are incorporated along with the MTA as a way  of addressing this weakness. The chapter concludes by arguing that the revised  MTA offers a richer and more complete description and explanation of the use  life cycle than has been available hitherto. The Life Cycle of IT Use The life cycle of IT use describes the phases through which use of an IT artefact  transitions—from the period prior to use through to continued or discontinued  use. How the life cycle is represented is influenced by the ways in which use is  conceptualised and examined. When use is conceptualised as the extent of use,  the life cycle entails pre-use, initial use and continued use (see Figure 4.1). The  extent of use is commonly assessed via self-reporting measures of the frequency  or amount of use. Use is framed as a thing that changes in value but not in  identity or character. Alternatively, the life cycle can be understood in terms of  the nature of use and includes adaptive use and stabilised use (see Figure 4.2).  The nature of use is viewed as potentially taking qualitatively different forms  such as adaptation, stabilisation and appropriation and is often identified using  qualitative methods (Carroll, 2004). The diagram in Figure 4.3 captures how use  is represented and explored from the two perspectives combined. 80 </page> <page sequence="5"> 4 . Theorising about the Life Cycle of IT Use: An appropriation perspective Pre-use Initial use Continued use Figure 4.1 The Extent of Use Life Cycle  Adaptive use Stabilised use Figure 4.2 The Nature of Use Life Cycle  Continued use Adaptive use Stabilised use Pre-use Initial use Figure 4.3 The Life Cycle of IT Use Pre-use captures the period prior to a potential user starting to use a technology  to support particular activities and practices (Bhattacherjee and Premkumar,  2004). This phase involves a user becoming acquainted with some of the features  offered by the technology when first exposed to it, or following information  about a proposed technology, as might occur via word of mouth. Attention is  given to pre-use in situations where use is not well established, such as for  new or prototype systems. In particular, researchers have attempted to predict  future use by assessing users’ intentions to engage in system use (behavioural  intention) (Agarwal and Prasad, 1998; Davis et al., 1989; Karahanna et al., 1999;  Mathieson, 1991; Taylor and Todd, 1995a, 1995b). Pre-use is followed by initial use (Jasperson et al., 2005), during which time  the user starts to employ features of the technology to support the conduct of  tasks, such as might occur during a training course (Burton-Jones and Straub,  2006). In assessing initial use, researchers have used a variety of lean survey- based measures including frequency of use and time spent using the system  (Adams et al., 1992; Al-Gahtani and King, 1999; Davis, 1989; Davis et al., 1989;  Hubona and Geitz, 1997; Igbaria, 1990; Igbaria et al., 1989, 1997; Raymond,  1985; Roberts and Henderson, 2000). To a lesser extent, researchers have used  hardware (DeLone and McLean, 1992) and software (Venkatesh et al., 2003)  monitors to record actual system use. 81 </page> <page sequence="6"> Information Systems Foundations: Theory building in information systems Adaptive use occurs as a user engages in a more detailed exploration of the  technology through applying the technology to support work practices within  particular use contexts (Constantinides and Barrett, 2006; Desouza et al., 2007;  Trigg and Bødker, 1994). Adaptations are made to the technology by a particular  user to support their specific practices and use context, and adaptations are also  made to user practices and the use context in response to the technology (Trigg  and Bødker, 1994; Tyre and Orlikowski, 1994). Adaptations to the technology  itself have been described using such terms as personalisation (Desouza et al.,  2007), customisation (Desouza et al., 2007; Mackay, 1990a, 1990b; Trigg and  Bødker, 1994), inventions (Desouza et al., 2007), reinvention (Johnson and Rice,  1984; Rice and Rogers, 1980; Rogers, 1995) and tailoring (Trigg and Bødker,  1994). Adaptations to work practices include work-arounds and improvisation  (Hayes, 1999). Researchers also describe mutual changes in the technology and  associated practices through such concepts as mutual adaptation (Boersma and  Kingma, 2005; Carroll, 2004; Leonard-Barton, 1988; Majchrzak, et al. 2000),  mutual adjustment (Rose and Jones, 2005), co-adaptation (Mackay, 1990a,  1990b), coevolution (Kim and Kaplan, 2006), structuring (Barley, 1986; DeSanctis  and Poole, 1994) and the process of appropriation (Carroll 2004; Mendoza et al.,  2008). Stabilised use entails the routinisation of patterns of use (Rogers, 1995; Trigg and  Bødker, 1994; Tyre and Orlikowski, 1994). Routines that develop might change  in response to discrepant events or new discoveries by users (represented by  the two-way arrow between adaptation and stabilisation) (Mendoza et al., 2005;  Tyre and Orlikowski, 1994). Such stabilised use is also referred to as structured  (Trigg and Bødker, 1994), integrated, appropriated (Carroll, 2004), infused  (Sundaram et al., 2007) or institutionalised use (Orlikowski, 1992). Continued use is an alternative to adaptive and stabilised use when the nature of  use is not explored. It is the period of use that follows initial or first use (Hsieh  et al., 2008; Karahanna et al., 1999; Pollard, 2003; Rogers, 1995; Shih, 2008;  Venkatesh et al., 2003). Like the initial use phase, frequency of use and time  spent using the system are often assessed. Theories to Explain the Life Cycle There are a large number of candidate theories that could be drawn on to assist  in describing, explaining or predicting one or more aspects of the IT use life  cycle. The theories discussed below have been selected based on their alignment  with one or more of the key phases associated with the life cycle, but also  based on their prominence within the IS research community. The key theories  considered in this chapter are technology acceptance, innovation diffusion,  82 </page> <page sequence="7"> 4 . Theorising about the Life Cycle of IT Use: An appropriation perspective structuration and the model of technology appropriation. A selection of studies  drawing on each of these theories is summarised in Table 4.1, along with the  phases of the use life cycle considered.

(2005) 3 3 3 3 Mendoza et al. (2008) 3 3 3 3 Table 4.1 suggests that very few researchers have considered use over the whole  life cycle (four phases), or even over three phases. The majority of research on  the use of IT artefacts only provides a partial view of use across the life cycle.  Technology acceptance and innovation diffusion perspectives attend to the  extent of the use life cycle (see Figure 4.1). Structuration focuses on the nature  of the use life cycle (see Figure 4.2). Only studies drawing on the MTA cover the  whole life cycle, from pre-use through to stabilised use. Our attention now turns  to the descriptive and explanatory potential offered by each of these theoretical  perspectives. 83 </page> <page sequence="8"> Information Systems Foundations: Theory building in information systems Technology Acceptance The theoretical grounding for much of the research into user acceptance  comes from the technology acceptance model (TAM) developed by Davis et al.  (1989), Venkatesh et al. (2003) and Venkatesh and Bala (2008). This model is  an adaptation of the theory of reasoned action (TRA), which sees beliefs and  attitudes as antecedents of future behavioural responses, such as actual system  use (Ajzen, 1985; Davis, 1993). TAM differs from the TRA by identifying the  role of external variables more explicitly and by identifying two particular  belief constructs as particularly relevant in the IS domain—namely, perceived  usefulness and perceived ease of use. These beliefs are seen—either directly  or indirectly and via attitudes towards using the technology—to shape users’  intentions to employ a system, which in turn determines system use, which is  usually conceptualised as the extent of use (Davis, 1989; Davis et al., 1989). Figure  4.4 presents TAM as represented by Davis et al. (1989). An important feature of  the model is its focus on prospective users, as evidenced by the definition of  perceived usefulness as ‘a prospective user’s subjective probability that using  a specific application system will increase his or her job performance within  an organisational context’. In subsequent studies the model and associated  variables have been applied to both prospective and current users of systems,  through changing the tense of scale items (for example, Venkatesh et al., 2003). Perceived Usefulness (U) Attitude Behavioural Actual External Toward Intention to System variables Using (A) Use (BI) Use Perceived Ease of Use (E) Figure 4.4 The Technology Acceptance Model Source: Davis et al. (1989, p. 985). The research by Davis (1989) and colleagues (Davis et al., 1989) on technology  acceptance and its antecedents (perceived usefulness and ease of use) has had,  and continues to have, an enormous influence on IS research. This is a positive  in the sense that it has laid the foundation for a cumulative tradition whereby  there has been widespread and persistent use of the two key variables— perceived ease of use and usefulness—in a diverse range of use contexts and  technologies. In addition, statistical methods such as regression analysis and  structural equation modelling that have been employed in these numerous  studies to test hypothesised links between these variables and use afford  researchers statistical control that can be construed as a form of experimentation  84 </page> <page sequence="9"> 4 . Theorising about the Life Cycle of IT Use: An appropriation perspective (Lee, 1999). This can assist in cutting through the complexity of the phenomena  of interest. Such statistical experimentation has assisted in confirming the  central role of perceived usefulness, and to a lesser extent perceived ease of use,  in predicting behavioural intention and use. The parsimony of TAM, however,  and its apparent power in explaining a fair portion of the variance, appear to  have led to an overemphasis on the extent of variance explained rather than  the untidy and messy unexplained variance. A focus on pre-specified variables  and the explained variance in models such as TAM leads to a neglect of context,  which removes the capacity to understand the ‘subtle nuances of interaction  that are critical in apprehending what is really occurring’ (Pfeffer, 1982, p. 75).  As a result, whilst levels of perceived usefulness and ease of use would assist  managers with understanding influences on intentions and use in a general  sense, the information provided would say little about the specific contextual  factors operating on users of the particular technology. Even when attention is  constrained to explained variance there are methodological issues associated  with questionnaires (Sharma and Yetton, 2001; Straub and Burton-Jones,  2007). A meta-analysis by Sharma and Yetton (2001, p. 1170) found that ‘the  average correlation between “perceived usefulness” and “use” is 0.26 in studies  employing behavioral measures of use and 0.56 in studies employing perceptual  measures of use’. This effect, whereby perceptual or self-reporting measures of  use lead to higher correlations, is referred to as self-generated validity (Taylor  and Todd, 1995b). It is proposed that ‘when survey respondents are asked about  issues to which they have given very little prior thought, they...are apt to use  answers to earlier survey questions as the bases for responses to later questions,  resulting in inflated causal linkages’ (Taylor and Todd, 1995b, p. 171). So, rather  than describing cognitions and behaviours, researchers run the risk of creating  and even changing them (Ogden, 2003; Pfeffer, 1982; Taylor and Todd, 1995b).  The development of TAM was driven by a desire to predict and explain human  behaviour (Davis et al., 1989). TAM and associated acceptance models such as  UTAUT are cognitive-rational theories that assume system use is driven by the  intentionality of users, with users’ intentions being informed by their beliefs  and attitudes towards the technology of interest (Pfeffer, 1982). To the extent  that behaviour is driven by intention then such models have some utility;  however, this class of theories has been widely criticised in the social and  management sciences more broadly (Abraham and Sheeran, 2004; Ogden, 2003;  Pfeffer, 1982). Such theories have been criticised for •  not helping to explain the variety of things people use, such as the range of  features employed on a system, versus just explaining a particular behaviour  of interest, such as extent of system use (Abraham and Sheeran, 2004) •  creating and shaping rather than describing users’ cognitions and behaviours  (Ogden, 2003; Pfeffer, 1982; Taylor and Todd, 1995) 85 </page> <page sequence="10"> Information Systems Foundations: Theory building in information systems •  often assuming unidirectional causality and the associated implication that  beliefs and attitudes come before behaviour, despite evidence that behaviour  also shapes attitudes and beliefs (Mintzberg and Westley, 2001; Pfeffer,  1982); people do not always think or choose before taking action, such as  when engaged in habitual behaviours; when asked about the reasons for  their behaviours this could reflect retrospective rationality, not prospective  rationality as is assumed in such models (Pfeffer, 1982) •  providing a weak source of explanation as to why the relationships identified  are significant (Hovorka et al., 2008; Pfeffer, 1982). As Hovorka argues, ‘a  falling barometer allows inference that there has been a drop in air pressure,  but the drop cannot be explained by referring to the barometer’ (p. 32). In the  context of TAM, the source of explanation is the set of variables statistically  identified as linked to intentions and behaviours. Such statistical inferences  only afford partial understanding of the phenomena of interest. Whilst the  variables might predict use, their ability to explain use is limited. Another limitation of user acceptance models like TAM and UTAUT is that  time is viewed as part of the background (Van de Ven and Poole, 2005). The  amount of time is uncritically applied as an indicator of experience, familiarity  and routinisation (Venkatesh et al., 2003), or the interest in time is limited to  providing distance between two measurements so as to determine the strength  of the causal relationship between behavioural intention and system use (for  example, Davis, 1989; Taylor and Todd, 1995b). These limitations raise serious  questions about the utility of TAM and related models for understanding  the life cycle of use, and it is for these reasons, and others, that there have  been widespread calls to go beyond TAM (Bagozzi, 2007; Baron et al., 2006;  Benbasat and Barki, 2007; Carayannis and Turner, 2006; Dishaw and Strong,  1999; Goodhue, 2007; Hirschheim, 2007; Lucas et al., 2007; Mendoza et al.,  2005; Schwarz and Chin, 2007; Silva, 2007; Straub and Burton-Jones, 2007).  Nevertheless, such models can assist in drawing inferences about the salience  and strength of particular influences on intentions and use, which might be  particularly relevant at the pre-use and initial use phases when users might be  expected to be more driven by intentions (Venkatesh et al., 2003). Diffusion of Innovation The literature on the diffusion of innovations is diverse and populated by a  variety of different models that address individual and organisational decision  points and activities (Cooper and Zmud, 1990; Hage and Aiken, 1970; Johnson  and Rice, 1984; King, 1990; Kwon and Zmud, 1987; Rice and Rogers, 1980;  Rogers, 1995; Wolfe, 1994). One researcher in particular has, however, dominated  research into the diffusion of innovations for decades: Everett Rogers. In his  book Diffusion of Innovations (1995), Rogers presents models of the innovation  86 </page> <page sequence="11"> 4 . Theorising about the Life Cycle of IT Use: An appropriation perspective diffusion process that emphasise either the individual or the organisational  processes, as well as models of adoption and implementation. Of particular  relevance here is his model that describes the innovation diffusion process for  individuals (see Figure 4.5). The model has five stages •  knowledge: the stage where a potential adopter becomes aware of an  innovation and develops some understanding of its capabilities •  persuasion: the stage where the formation of either positive or negative  attitudes towards an innovation occurs •  decision: the stage where a person decides either to adopt or to reject an  innovation •  implementation: the stage where a person puts an innovation to use •  confirmation: the stage where either the innovation decision is reinforced or  an earlier decision to adopt or reject a system is reversed. I. KNOWLEDGE II. PERSUASION III. DECISION IV. IMPLEMENTATION IV. CONFIRMATION 1. Adoption Continued adoption Later adoption Discontinuance 2. Rejection Continued rejection Figure 4.5 A Model of Stages in the Innovation Decision Process Source: Rogers (1995, p. 163).  In addition to these stages, Rogers also identifies five key attributes of innovations  that influence user adoption at the persuasion stage •  relative advantage: the extent to which an innovation is viewed as better  than its predecessor •  compatibility: the extent to which an innovation is viewed as consistent  with the extant needs, values, beliefs and experiences of potential adopters •  complexity: the extent to which an innovation is viewed as difficult to use •  observability: the extent to which the impacts of an innovation are visible  to others •  trialability: the extent to which an innovation can be experimented with  prior to the adoption decision. The above model and associated five key attributes have been drawn on  extensively in the IS literature (for example, Agarwal and Prasad, 1998;  87 </page> <page sequence="12"> Information Systems Foundations: Theory building in information systems Karahanna et al., 1999; Kautz and Larsen, 2000; Kraut et al., 1998; Lin and Lee,  2006; Moore and Benbasat, 1991; Pollard, 2003; Prescott and Conger, 1995; Rice  and Rogers, 1980; Shih, 2008). They support exploration of influences prior  to, during and after the adoption decision. Furthermore, the model draws a  distinction between initial use, during which time the innovation is put to use  (implementation stage), and continued/discontinued use (confirmation stage)  (Pollard, 2003). Rogers’ model and other models of the innovation adoption and diffusion  process (Carayannis and Turner, 2006; Cooper and Zmud, 1990; Hage and Aiken,  1970; Johnson and Rice, 1984; Kwon and Zmud, 1987; Nord and Tucker, 1987;  Saga and Zmud, 1994) are life-cycle models. As such, change is explained by  reference to the sequence of phases through which the system of interest passes  (Van de Ven and Poole, 1995). Such life-cycle models tell us little, however,  about the underpinning mechanisms that generate the behaviour observed, and,  with some exceptions (for example, Rogers), tend to be analytically or meta- analytically derived rather than emerging from first-hand longitudinal research  on the adoption and diffusion of technologies. A counter to this argument might be to say that explanation is provided by  assessing users’ perceptions of a system using the five key attributes. While  studies investigating the influence of these attributes help to identify important  influences on adoption and use, they often do so from the perspective of cross- sectional or ‘factor’-based research (for example, Agarwal and Prasad, 1998; Lin  and Lee, 2006). As a consequence of this methodological constraint the clearly  process-orientated nature of innovation diffusion theories can only be partially  examined and explained (McMaster and Wastell, 2005). A further issue with  these five key attributes is the assumption that they primarily operate at the  persuasion stage, when there is clear evidence that such affective attributes  operate after the adoption decision (Karahanna et al., 1999). There are two additional criticisms that have been directed at the innovation  diffusion literature. Historian David Edgerton argues that views of innovation  tend to be centred on innovations as they are emerging, not after they have  long been in use: ‘Even as new technologies revolutionize everything from  health care to media to warfare, it’s important to remember that our world runs  primarily on products and technologies long in use’ (Baker, 2007). Rogers (1995,  p. 172) also criticises innovation research for having a strong pro-innovation  bias, going on to say that ‘investigation of rejection behavior of all kinds has not  received much scientific attention’. Diffusion of innovation research provides a basis upon which to investigate the  life cycle of use; however, it does so from a perspective that privileges the new  over the taken for granted, adoption over rejection, and factor over process. 88 </page> <page sequence="13"> 4 . Theorising about the Life Cycle of IT Use: An appropriation perspective Structuration Information systems researchers have extensively drawn on structuration  theory—in particular, Anthony Giddens’ structuration theory (1986)—to assist  in explaining the interactions between technology and people embedded in  social contexts, such as organisations (Jones and Karsten, 2008). Giddens was  concerned with transcending the dichotomous logic associated with dominant  traditions within social theory that privileged either the agency of individuals  or the structures that limit human choices and action, such as properties of  society. Structurational theories seek to reconcile tensions between individual  and societal-level explanations of social phenomena through seeing both as  being mutually constituted (Jones and Karsten, 2008). Social phenomena, from  a structurational perspective, are the product of both structure and agency:  ‘human agents draw on social structures in their actions, and at the same time  these actions serve to produce and reproduce social structure’ (Jones and  Karsten, 2008, p. 129). These structures, or more particularly the structural  properties of social systems, consist of rules and resources used by individuals  in their interactions. ‘These rules and resources mediate human action, while  at the same time they are reaffirmed through being used by human actors’  (Orlikowski, 1992, p. 404). Whilst this process of mutual constitution enables  change in social systems, Giddens’ argued that continual change is countered  by a desire amongst social actors for ontological security, a belief that their  personal or professional identities will be maintained and that actions and events  in the surrounding social and material environment will not undermine their  identity. Predictability and routinisation are therefore of central importance in  maintaining the identities of social actors (Jones and Karsten, 2008). Giddens’ structuration theory has been translated into IS in a variety of ways.  The appeal of this theory for IS researchers is that it provides a means of  adopting a non-dichotomous logic (Pozzebon, 2004). For IS researchers adopting  a structurational perspective, the structure/agency dichotomy is overcome  by framing the relationship between technology and humans as the process  through which humans shape and are shaped by IT artefacts (Orlikowski, 1992;  Poole and DeSanctis, 1990). One particularly dominant translation of Giddens’  theory within IS is Poole and DeSanctis’s adaptive structuration theory (Poole  and DeSanctis, 1990). Adaptive structuration theory (AST) emerged out of research focused on social  interactions and processes associated with the use of group decision support  systems (DeSanctis and Poole, 1994; Poole and DeSanctis, 1990). DeSanctis and  Poole (1994) present a number of different propositions associated with their  modification of structuration theory for IS; however, two propositions are  particularly salient as they bring to the surface three key concepts associated  with AST (highlighted in italics). 89 </page> <page sequence="14"> Information Systems Foundations: Theory building in information systems •  Advanced information technologies (AITs) ‘provide social structures that  can be described in terms of their features and spirit. To the extent that  AITs vary in their spirit and structural feature sets, different forms of social  interaction are encouraged by the technology’ (p. 128; italics added). •  ‘New social structures emerge in group interaction as the rules and resources  of an AIT are appropriated in a given context and then reproduced in group  interaction over time’ (p. 129; italics added). Structural features represent particular capabilities, or rules and resources,  provided by the system. Structural features ‘govern exactly how information can  be gathered, manipulated and otherwise managed by users’ (p. 126). Underlying  these structural features is the way in which users should act when employing the  system, referred to as the spirit. The spirit of a technology reflects, amongst other  things, the designers’ intentions; however, the ways in which users appropriate  or implement the technology are not necessarily determined by the technology  design. The particular structural features selected by users represent only a subset  of those embedded within a technology. Users therefore are able to appropriate  the capabilities of a system in a wide variety of ways (DeSanctis and Poole,  1994). Appropriation is here understood to be the ‘immediate, visible actions  that evidence deeper structuration processes’ (p. 128). Analysis of appropriation  moves therefore provides a way of examining the underlying social processes. One of the concerns about AST is its view of technology as encapsulating social  structures in the form of structural features and spirit. This view runs counter to  the position adopted by Giddens, who argued that social structures do not have an  existence independent of the action of humans (Markus and Silver, 2008). A further  concern is the apparent anthropomorphism of the spirit concept, which is described  as somehow conveying or embodying the designers’ intentions (Markus and Silver,  2008). Another issue with AST is that research that has operationalised one or more of  its key constructs has failed to identify strong relationships with common influences  such as ease of use and usefulness; instead the findings are inconsistent and only  moderate in strength (Chin et al., 1997; DeSanctis and Poole, 1994; DeSanctis et  al., 2000; Gopal et al., 1992; Salisbury et al., 2002). AST also appears to have been  predominantly applied to group or collaborative information systems such as group  decision support systems and computer-mediated communication (Jones and Karsten,  2008), rather than less socially mediated systems. A more general criticism of structurational approaches is that readers experience  difficulties in readily understanding the meaning of the text. Information systems  is an applied discipline and it has been argued that the accessibility of theories  is an important consideration in judging relevance (Rosemann and Vessey,  2008). Structuration theory and AST are frequently difficult to comprehend and  employ concepts in ways that bear little relation to their more common forms of  use. For example, Giddens’ definition of structure, defined in terms of rules and  90 resources, is particularly idiosyncratic (Jones and Karsten, 2008). </page> <page sequence="15"> 4 . Theorising about the Life Cycle of IT Use: An appropriation perspective Researches drawing on Giddens’ theory, in particular his views on the importance  of ontological security, follow him in privileging routinisation and the maintenance  of individual identities over adaptation and transformation (Chu and Robey,  2008). While adaptation has its place, it is subordinate to stability. This position  is consistent with empirical research suggesting that over time adaptations  become structured (for example, Carroll, 2004; Trigg and Bødker, 1994; Tyre and  Orlikowski, 1994). Research has, however, also found that adaptations can again  occur (Mendoza et al., 2005, 2007; Tyre and Orlikowski, 1994). Model of Technology Appropriation (MTA) The model of technology appropriation (MTA) was developed by Carroll et  al. (2002c) to assist with understanding the process of appropriation through  which technology is evaluated by people over time and adopted, adapted  and incorporated into their work practices, and through which the design of  technology is completed through use (Figure 4.6). Disappropriation Explore Evaluate Non-adoption Level 2 adoption Adapt Appropriation process Level 1 Possibilities Appropriation Technology Technology  as designed in Use Level 3 Figure 4.6 The Model of Technology Appropriation Source: Carroll (2004, p. 5). The MTA is intended to be a generic model of technology appropriation that  can be tailored for particular technologies and user cohorts (Carroll, 2004). It  has been employed to assist in describing the appropriation of mobile phones,  bibliographic software, Short Messaging Service (SMS), email, customer  relationship management software, open source software and a learning  management system (Carroll et al., 2002a, 2003a, 2003b, 2005; Herszfeld et al.,  91 </page> <page sequence="16"> Information Systems Foundations: Theory building in information systems 2003; Heung, 2002; Mendoza et al., 2007; Nor Zairah and Rose Alinda, 2007).  Throughout the process of appropriation various influences shape the beliefs,  attitudes and behaviours of users towards the technology. In the model there are three levels of evaluation that correspond with different  phases of the appropriation process (Carroll et al., 2002a). As can be seen in  Figure 4.6, when first encountering a technology during the initial exposure  phase, users are confronted with the technology as intended by its designer, or  ‘technology as designed’, which ‘has features, capabilities and an underlying  theory or spirit’ about how the technology should be employed (p. 3). From  the users’ perspective, the technology presents a variety of possibilities for  addressing their particular concerns, which might or might not align with those  identified by the designers. During users’ initial exposure to the technology  a series of influences shapes their evaluations and decisions whether or not  to adopt the technology. In the case of an information system, influences on  users might include the graphical user interface and system functionality. The  outcome of this level-one evaluation is the establishment of certain expectations  about what the technology can deliver, which leads to either non-adoption or  the user choosing to persist with exploring the technology thereby continuing  the appropriation process. In the case where the user chooses not to adopt the  technology there might be circumstances that cause them to re-evaluate the  technology at some later time (represented by the dashed arrow from non- adoption to level one in Figure 4.6). At the next phase of the appropriation process users evaluate the technology  more deeply through exploring and using the technology (level-two evaluation)  (Carroll, 2004; Herszfeld et al., 2003). They come to learn how the technology  can support their practices through the provision of particular functionality.  As users explore and learn about the technology they also adapt their practices  associated with the technology as well as adapting the technology itself.  During this adaptation phase there is again a variety of influences that serves to  encourage or discourage continued appropriation—for example, the extent to  which the technology enhances the user’s performance. In the final phase a state of appropriation or stabilisation is reached, whereby  the practices around the use of the technology become routine, and no further  adaptations to the technology occur (Carroll, 2004). The technology becomes  integrated with work practices, is part of users’ taken-for-granted experience of  work, and is just another part of the work landscape, referred to as ‘technology  in use’. It is during this phase that the design can be said to be fixed, although  this might not be permanent (Mendoza et al., 2005) (see dotted arrow back to  level two). The state of appropriation is maintained as long as users’ ongoing  evaluation of the ‘technology in use’ continues to reinforce persistent use.  The particular patterns of use that users settle on are assumed to vary across  92 </page> <page sequence="17"> 4 . Theorising about the Life Cycle of IT Use: An appropriation perspective individuals, conveyed by the tiled boxes associated with ‘technology in use’  in Figure 4.6. These level-three evaluations are shaped by various influences— for example, the attitudes and behaviours of one’s peer group towards the  technology or the performance of the technology. Users’ persistent use and  ongoing incorporation of the technology with their work practices are,  however, subject to modification if their evaluation of the technology changes.  If this occurs then users might return to level two and the technology could be  disappropriated or rejected. The two primary strengths of the MTA are that it covers the life cycle from pre- use through to stabilised use, and it is a readily accessible and quite parsimonious  model. It also explicitly distinguishes between adaptation and stabilisation  (although the latter is referred to, somewhat confusingly, as appropriation), as  well as incorporating the adoption decision and the possibility of technology  rejection occurring after a period of use. In addition, the model highlights  the role of influences in shaping users’ evaluations and associated patterns of  appropriation throughout the process, although, due to the generic nature of  the model, these influences are not specified and are assumed to vary across  technologies and cohorts (Carroll, 2004). Nevertheless, in describing the model,  Carroll (2004) argues that the features of the technology are particularly important  when first encountering a technology, with system usefulness becoming more  salient as users apply the technology in context. The model shares concepts from the models and theories described earlier. The  concept of ‘spirit’, also used by DeSanctis and Poole (AST), is drawn on to help  describe the ‘technology as designed’. The MTA incorporates the concept of  mutual shaping or adaptation, like AST. The MTA includes the decision to adopt  as an outcome of initial exposure, as does Rogers (1995). The MTA therefore  provides a means of describing use of technology over time in a way that is  quite nuanced, as well as being consistent with prior research; however, the  model emphasises description over explanation and prediction, which is not  unexpected given that the model emerged from empirical research. It therefore  does not provide much in the way of insights as to the underpinning or generative  mechanisms that shape users evaluations and patterns of appropriation, other  than to flag the need to identify the particular influences operating on users’  evaluations of a particular technology. 93 </page> <page sequence="18"> Information Systems Foundations: Theory building in information systems Identification and Development of a Theory for  Understanding the Use Life Cycle Each of the theories or models considered above has a variety of strengths and  weaknesses that can assist in understanding one or more aspects of the use life  cycle, which are summarised in Table 4.2.

Only the MTA provides coverage across the entire life cycle from pre-use through  to stabilisation. The model also facilitates understanding of the dynamics of  influences on and patterns of use, and does so in a way that is readily accessible  and quite parsimonious. Furthermore, it considers technology and relationships  with users at the micro-level of analysis. It is for these reasons, as well as the  additional strengths listed in Table 4.2, that the MTA is the most promising  candidate theory for understanding the whole life cycle of IT use. There are,  94 </page> <page sequence="19"> 4 . Theorising about the Life Cycle of IT Use: An appropriation perspective however, two areas where the MTA is less strong: its ability to explain the how  and why of the appropriation process, and the limited cumulative tradition. The  latter issue is addressed through drawing on the MTA in this chapter, thereby  contributing to the ongoing establishment of a cumulative tradition. The former  concern about explanatory power is addressed quite well in structurational  models like AST, but such power is diminished by their low accessibility and  parsimony. What are required are theories of change that complement the MTA  by enhancing the capacity to explain the appropriation process in a way that is  readily accessible. Van de Ven and Poole (1995) reviewed theories of change in the biological,  physical and social sciences. They identified four ‘ideal type’ theories of change:  life cycle, teleology, dialectic and evolution. The MTA provides largely a life-cycle  perspective on the change process whereby change is explained in terms of a  sequence of phases through which the system of interest passes. The progression  through the phases is presumed to follow a certain immanent logic or sequence  that is pre-programmed. While the environment influences how the entity  expresses itself, such as the particular patterns of adaptation and stabilisation, as  well as their timing, these types of change events are nevertheless mediated by  the immanent logic, or what Van de Ven and Poole (1995) referred to more broadly  as the generative mechanism. The use of a life-cycle perspective provides a way  of generating rich descriptions of the entity of interest. It is, however, somewhat  limited with respect to explaining how and why the entity of interest changes  or remains stable over time. This constraint can be overcome by juxtaposing  additional theories of change and their associated generative mechanisms. A teleological perspective frames change as being driven by the purposeful  pursuit of goals (Van de Ven and Poole, 1995). The generative mechanism is  the enactment of goals, which in the IT domain would be undertaken by users  or organisations. Users or organisations are seen to act as intentional agents  working to achieve the fulfilment of their goals. Furthermore, these agents  are presumed to be adaptive and creative in formulating and enacting their  goals. Unlike life-cycle theories there is no prescribed sequence. Instead, there  is ‘a repetitive sequence of goal formulation, implementation, evaluation, and  modification of goals based on what was learned or intended by the entity’  (p. 516). Theories in IS that draw on cognitive rational theories, such as many  theories of acceptance and innovation diffusion, similarly assume that change  is driven by the intentionality of users, with users’ intentions being informed  by their beliefs and attitudes towards the technology of interest (Pfeffer, 1982). Dialectic theories explain stability and change by reference to the tension  that exists between opposing or contradictory forces, such as that between  advocates of the status quo, the thesis and those promoting change—the  antithesis (Van de Ven and Poole, 1995). The types of outcomes resulting from  95 </page> <page sequence="20"> Information Systems Foundations: Theory building in information systems tensions can be understood in terms of maintenance, substitution or synthesis.  Maintenance describes the continuance of the status quo, with the thesis  dominating the antithesis. Substitution occurs when the thesis is replaced with  the antithesis. The third possible outcome is a synthesis between the thesis  and antithesis—an outcome that is distinct from its constituent elements. The  generative mechanism or motor of change in dialectic theories is the tension or  conflict that exists between opposing forces. None of the theories considered  here clearly represents or draws on a dialectic perspective, although there are  examples of such theories being employed in IS (Cho et al., 2007; Myers, 1994;  Robey and Boudreau, 1999; Robey et al., 2002). Giddens’ structuration theory  incorporates dialectic elements by identifying the possible tensions that exist  between human agency and the structural properties of the contexts within  which humans are embedded. The synthesis from this tension is the process of  mutual constitution of agency and structural properties; however, it is not clear  how agency or structure could exist independently of the other, as is the case in  the dialectic theories described by Van de Ven and Poole (1995). Evolutionary theory views and explains change as occurring through a continuous  process of variation, selection and retention (Van de Ven and Poole, 1995). Variation  comes about due to random or unpredictable changes or events. Selection occurs  through competition for scarce resources in the environment. Retention refers to  maintenance of an entity’s form; it serves to counteract the ‘self-reinforcing loop  between variations and selection’ (p. 518). An evolutionary perspective therefore  captures the tension between change and inertia associated with the status  quo or temporary stabilisations. The role of unpredictable discrepant events in  explaining additional adaptations in the research by Tyre and Orlikowski (1994)  is an example of research that is consistent with an evolutionary perspective.  There are studies that have also more explicitly drawn on one or more aspects  of evolutionary theory in the IS domain such as coevolution (Fidock, 2002; Kim  and Kaplan, 2006) and punctuated equilibrium (Lyytinen and Newman, 2008;  Mendoza et al., 2007; Sabherwal et al., 2001). The teleological, dialectic and evolutionary lenses, together with the life- cycle perspective offered by the MTA, offer the potential for providing greater  understanding of the life cycle of IT use than would be provided by drawing  on only one theoretical perspective. This is because particular theoretical  perspectives, as metaphorical devices or lenses, draw attention to particular  features or qualities whilst also leaving out others. It is the integration and  juxtaposition of these theories to develop new theory that has stronger and  broader explanatory power than the initial perspectives (Van de Ven and  Poole, 1995). Through incorporating the theories of change, the explanatory  power of the MTA is enhanced. This is summarised in Figure 4.7. Each of the  theories of change offers alternative and complementary explanations of why  96 </page> <page sequence="21"> 4 . Theorising about the Life Cycle of IT Use: An appropriation perspective appropriations change over time. The contribution of each theory of change to  enhancing the MTA is now examined through the case of electronic mail in the  Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). Due to space limitations,  consideration is limited to the separate contributions of each change theory.  Future work will examine the ways in which the theories can be combined and  sequenced to further enhance explanation. Disappropriation Explore Evaluate Non-adoption Level 2 adoption Adapt Appropriation process Level 1 Possibilities Appropriation Technology Technology  as designed in Use Level 3 Life cycle: prescribed movement through phases Teleology: purposeful pursuit of goals Dialectic: tension between opposing forces Evolution: variation, selection  and retention Figure 4.7 An Enhanced Theory for Explaining the IT Life Cycle Source: Adapted from Carroll (2004, p. 5). Explaining the IT Use Life Cycle: The case of email Life Cycle In DSTO, email is a mature and pervasive technology that is thoroughly  incorporated with peoples’ practices to become a ‘technology in use’.  Furthermore, the amount of exposure of individuals to this technology was  substantial and ranged from four to 28 years. In the MTA, ‘technology in use’ is  associated with stabilisation in patterns of appropriation. There was evidence of  stability, such as frequency of filing messages and the way email was managed.  Also consistent with the MTA, there was evidence of adaptations occurring  to the default configuration of MS Outlook 2003 after its introduction, such as  97 </page> <page sequence="22"> Information Systems Foundations: Theory building in information systems turning off the reading pane or turning off the message reminders, followed by  stability in these reconfigurations. There were also instances of people making  further changes to their configurations as a result of reflecting on how their  current configuration might not readily support desired practices; deciding, for  example, to turn off the message reminders after discussing this feature with  the researcher. The MTA therefore provides a way of describing phases through  which users might pass: adaptation, followed by stabilisation then renewed  adaptation. Another feature of the MTA is the proposition that users’ trajectories with  respect to how they come to adopt, adapt and incorporate technologies with  their practices are heterogeneous. There was substantial heterogeneity in  patterns of appropriation across individuals with respect to such things as  approaches to email management, rhythms of use and number of messages sent  and received. As Mackay (1988) found in her study more than 20 years ago, the  ‘use of electronic mail is strikingly diverse, although not infinitely so’ (p. 344). Teleology A multilevel examination of teleology was undertaken providing an assessment  of individual and organisational goals associated with use of email (Jasperson  et al., 2005; van den Hooff, 2005). During the data collection for this case,  DSTO made investments in two technologies designed to better support users  in managing emails (Enterprise Vault) and to communicate via computer more  dynamically (MS Communicator, which provides instant messaging). Enterprise  Vault was introduced to assist DSTO in meeting its archiving responsibilities and  to support staff in archiving and managing their messages. MS Communicator  was deployed in an effort to provide staff with modern office communication  technologies. These investments clearly influenced some users’ patterns of  appropriation, like an interviewee who had moved to using MS Communicator  to support social communication needs in the workplace. A range of belief and attitudinal influences, such as usability and usefulness, was  assessed in this case. None of these influences was significantly related with any of the  measures of appropriation. This is perhaps due to much of email users’ appropriations  not being goal directed but determined by habitual routines, such as rhythms of  use, as well as by contextual influences, such as the nature of a job. This finding  is consistent with the proposition put forward by Venkatesh et al. (2003) that such  influences might be less likely to apply where behaviour is generated by routinised  responses, rather than resulting from deliberate cognitions. Nevertheless, there was  widespread evidence from the qualitative data that many of the participants had  acted intentionally when changing their patterns of appropriation. The reasons given  98 </page> <page sequence="23"> 4 . Theorising about the Life Cycle of IT Use: An appropriation perspective for making intentional changes included reflection on extant practices associated  with email use, the introduction of other technologies and the patterns of use and  suggestions of other people. A teleological perspective draws attention to the purposeful pursuit of goals.  Prior research has found that email is not only ‘strikingly diverse’ but that  it also supports multiple goals (Wattenberg et al., 2005). In DSTO, email was  used to support a wide variety of goals such as communication, information  management and information sharing. Dialectics Dialectic process theory explains stability and change as the outcome of tensions  between opposing or competing entities (Van de Ven and Poole, 1995). Tensions  were analysed at the level of the email artefact and at the level of users’ practices  and associated technologies. Interviewees were asked to generate email similes.  Ambivalence towards email was a prominent feature of these similes. For  example, it is a ‘necessary evil’ that supports information exchange (thesis) but  which also has a big impact on time (antithesis). Ambivalence represented the  emotional synthesis resulting from tensions between the affordances (thesis)  and constraints (antithesis) of email. As has been discussed, email supports a variety of goals associated with  communications, information management and information sharing (the thesis).  There are other channels and technologies that also support the fulfilment of these  goals, particularly face-to-face and telephone (the antithesis). The use of email,  face-to-face, phone and other means of communication therefore provided users  with a portfolio of channels and technologies to support the fulfilment of these  goals (the synthesis). Two technologies associated with communications and information management  were introduced during the data collection phase of this case: Enterprise Vault  and MS Communicator. These technologies represented the antithesis to the  existing portfolio of technologies and practices associated with email (the  thesis). Enterprise Vault was deployed to all desktops, with users having the  option of installing MS Communicator if they so desired. Some individuals  embraced these new technologies by incorporating them into their portfolios, as  well as by adjusting their practices. The incorporation of the technologies with  existing portfolios represented a synthesis. Also apparent were substitutions  in functionality or affordances. Activities like informal communications and  archiving that were previously undertaken using email were now performed  using these new technologies. For example, one individual moved all of his  archived messages back into his inbox so that they would all be located in the  one place, with archiving of the inbox now done automatically by Enterprise  99 </page> <page sequence="24"> Information Systems Foundations: Theory building in information systems Vault, which in turn facilitated easier searching. Another individual had  substituted email with MS Communicator to support informal communication  and coordination amongst a walking group. The majority of other participants  had not changed the location of their folders to their inbox to take advantage of  the capabilities of Enterprise Vault, instead maintaining folders on their local PC  or on a shared drive. They also had not installed MS Communicator. Evolution Evolution entails a continuous cycle of variation, selection and retention.  Processes of variation and selection are associated with adaptations; retention  is associated with stabilisations. All of these processes were manifested in this  case. Variations result from unpredictable events. Four interviewees identified  accidents and incidents as influences on changes to their patterns of  appropriation. One individual had previously kept all deleted items just in case  he needed them, but accidentally deleted them one day and ‘the sky didn’t  fall in’. From this point on, he decided to be ‘a little more ruthless in culling  things’. Similarly, another person had accidentally bulk deleted the messages in  her inbox with no consequences. She subsequently decided to consciously bulk  delete messages. Both of these accidents can be seen to have led to more efficient  use of their time resources, the result of which was the selection of new email  deletion practices. Participants’ patterns of appropriation were typified by both adaptation and  inertia (retention). Participants retained similar patterns over time for checking  and filing messages, messages sent, inbox size, number of folders and the type  of email management approach adopted (inbox centric, folder centric or a  combination). Furthermore, the majority of participants perceived their use of  email as habitual. The MTA Enhanced Why did users’ appropriations of email vary? From the perspective of the MTA,  adaptations and stabilisations of patterns of appropriations were found, as  was variability across individuals. All of these features are found in the MTA,  and the sequencing of phases—adaptation then stabilisation then renewed  adaptation—was also manifested. This provides a limited answer, however, to  the ‘why’ question. An enhanced understanding of the process of appropriation  was provided by examining the results from the perspective of three additional  theories of change: teleology, dialectic and evolution. 100 </page> <page sequence="25"> 4 . Theorising about the Life Cycle of IT Use: An appropriation perspective •  A multilevel view of intentionality assisted in providing a richer assessment  of the rationale for changes in users’ patterns of appropriation. Belief and  attitudinal measures did not significantly influence users’ appropriations,  perhaps in part due to the lack of intentionality associated with various  routinised patterns of appropriations. Nevertheless, many of the changes in  patterns were intentional and were explained by reference to a variety of  context-specific influences. •  Ambivalence was an important emotional synthesis that emerged from the  tensions between the affordances and constraints of email. Email formed part  of users’ portfolios of communication channels and associated technologies  that included phone, face-to-face and a variety of other channels. These  channels and technologies were synthesised by users to create their portfolios.  The process of synthesising new technologies into users’ portfolios was also  accompanied by substitution of affordances from the old onto the new.  •  Accidents and incidents served as important influences on changes to  patterns of appropriation for some users. Furthermore, the translation of the  accidents into the selection of alternative appropriations was facilitated by  the unintended efficiency gains derived from the accidents. Conclusion In this chapter the life cycle of IT use has been briefly outlined. A range of  theories used to explain use has been considered and a candidate theory well  suited to explaining the life cycle of use has been selected: the MTA. The MTA  covers the entire life cycle from pre-use through to stablised use, as well as  incorporating many of the strengths of the other theories and models. The  MTA, however, is somewhat weak with respect to explaining the how and why  of changes in patterns of use over the life cycle. The MTA largely relies on  explanation by reference to an immanent logic as users move from one phase to  another. For example, in the email case, adaptation was followed by stabilisation.  To enhance explanation of the IT use life cycle, additional theories of change  need to be incorporated. A teleological lens assists in explaining organisational  and individual intentions associated with changes, such as the introduction of  new technologies associated with email, as well as explaining how contextual  influences contribute to changes in users’ intentions and behaviours. The  dialectic lens provides a way of explaining the substitutions, syntheses and  maintenance of the status quo associated with certain patterns of appropriation  over time. Finally, the evolutionary lens helps to explain how accidents and  incidents play a role in shaping user behaviours and choices in the context of  an environment constrained by limited time resources. To paraphrase Van de  Ven and Poole (1995), it is the integration of these additional theories of change  with the MTA that has led to the development of a new theory—the enhanced  101 </page> <page sequence="26"> Information Systems Foundations: Theory building in information systems MTA—which has stronger and broader explanatory power than the original  MTA. In so doing, the enhanced MTA represents an important contribution to  theorising about the life cycle of IT use. References Abraham, C., &amp; Sheeran, P. (2004).
