<plain_text><page sequence="1">Why Were the Jews Sacrificed?: The Place of Anti-Semitism in Dialectic of Enlightenment Anson Rabinbach The penultimate section of Dialectic of Enlightenment, "Elements of Anti-Semitism" was composed in the summer of 1943, four years after work on the book had begun, and after all the other sections were com- pleted. As was the case with the first chapter, the "Elements" were a collaborative enterprise. Leo Liwenthal contributed to the first three theses, and it is likely that the remaining three, and certainly the fifth and most original thesis on "idiosyncrasy" and "mimesis," were jointly dictated by Horkheimer and Adorno in July 1943.1 The seventh thesis, added in 1947, was solely the work of Horkheimer. Not initially intended for the volume published in 1944, the "Ele- ments" are usually described as theoretical elaborations destined for the Institute for Social Research's "anti-Semitism project" begun in 1939 and announced in the 1941 issue of the Institute's journal.2 In mid-1943 the "anti-Semitism project" took on renewed importance when the insti- tute was entrusted by the Jewish Labor Committee to conduct a mas- sive study of American labor's attitudes towards Jews. The following year, the American Jewish Committee selected Horkheimer as its Direc- tor of Scientific Research and launched an ambitious program culminat- ing in the five part Studies in Prejudice series published in 1949 and 1.

But he also emphasized that they were a counterpoint to the exclusively psychoanalytic and empirical character of that work. Their more explic- itly theoretical and "objective" character led Adorno to regret Dialectic of Enlightenment's unavailability in English translation because, he thought, the "Elements" might have prevented the (not entirely unjusti- fied) "misunderstanding" that usually accompanied The Authoritarian Personality, namely "that the authors had attempted to explain anti- Semitism, and even fascism in general, from a solely subjective perspec- tive."5 Adorno recalled that "the 'Elements of Anti-Semitism' situated racial prejudice in the context of an objectively oriented critical theory of society. However, in so doing, and in contrast to a certain economic orthodoxy, we did not rigidly oppose psychology, but accorded it its place as a moment of explanation in our draft. We never allowed any doubt about the primacy of objective factors over the psychological."6 In retrospect, the "misunderstanding" was not merely occasioned by the relative inaccessibility of a book first produced in a mimeographed edition, and subsequently by an obscure Dutch exile press. Rather, the "psychologism" of the institute's empirical studies were to no small extent the product of two other factors: Horkheimer and Adorno's frus- tration with the magnitude of the problem of providing an adequate explanation of anti-Semitism; and the immediate demand for "a thesis simple enough to be understood and appreciated by those who are trying to fight the giant fire with means which are by definition inadequate."7 3.

However, when we started our work in the spring of 1943, we became aware that the hour was too late for such a general histori- cal and international survey. We decided to devote our efforts immedi- ately to the drafting of methods which might lead to a better grasp of the social and psychological mechanisms underlying anti-Semitism. Horkheimer also later confirmed that he believed American anti-Semitism differed fundamentally from European manifestations, where it was more deeply rooted in tradition: "It is my conviction that the role which a firmly established anti-Semitic tradition plays in Europe is assumed here largely by the psychological phenomenon of mass imitation - that is, political anti-Semitism in America has rather the character of a contagion, of an epidemic, than of a deepseated and slowly developing illness." Adorno did not elaborate further on the place of the "Elements" in Dialectic of Enlightenment, but his remarks underscored their departure from the arguments first put forward in Horkheimer's 1939 essay "The Jews and Europe," which argued that, in the general transition from lib- eral society to the authoritarian or totalitarian state (not merely in the fascist universum), the putative extinction of the sphere of circulation had rendered the Jews superfluous. As representatives of individualism and exchange their very existence threatened the new mechanisms of administrative power: "The result is bad for the Jews," he wrote, "They are being run over. Others are the most capable today: the leaders of the new order in the economy and the state."10 Those insights, shared by many other European Marxists at the time, turned out to be extremely short-sighted, a limitation which Dialectic of Enlightenment explicitly rectified in its refusal to attribute a primacy of economics in the genesis of anti-Semitism.

On the one hand we have to differenti- ate radically between the economic-political factors which cause and use it, and the anthropological elements in the present type of man which respond to anti-Semitic propaganda as they would respond to other oppressive incentives; on the other hand we must show these fac- tors in their constant interconnection and describe how they permeate each other."11 This dual (actually triple) purpose accounts for the "Ele- ments" unsystematic juxtaposition and intertwining of anthropological, sociological, psychological, and economic perspectives. The economic dimension is still paramount in the assertion that the ultimate purpose of bourgeois anti-Semitism is to "disguise domination in production" and make the Jews scapegoats, "inasmuch as the economic injustice of the whole class is attributed to them."12 But the emphasis here is no longer on the presence of the Jews in the sphere of circulation, but on the Jews in the mental "imagery" of Nazism, which metaphorically sub- stitutes the Jews as the "hated mirror image of capitalism." However, as the argument deepens, anti-Semitism appears in more fundamental terms as "a deeply imprinted schema, a ritual of civilization" (DE 171). The Jews still appear in the "Elements" as the "colonizers for progress" (DE 174) and as the victims of a massive shift in the tectonic plates of capitalism, a theme not entirely compatible with the assertion that anti- Semitism belongs to the "primitive instincts negated by civilization."13 Horkheimer conceded as much when he remarked to Marcuse that "the Jews seem to be the aliens under all circumstances."14 Jay and others have shown that Horkheimer and Adorno's position on anti-Semitism had already changed during the early 1940s. 15 The new orientation is marked by the sentence "Whereas there is no longer any need for economic domination, the Jews are marked out as the absolute object of domination pure and simple" (DE 175).

To protect them is no longer an issue involving any particular group interests. To protect the Jews has come to be a symbol of every- thing mankind stands for. Anti-Semitic persecution is the stigma of the present world whose injustice enters all its weight upon the Jews. Thus, the Jews have been made what the Nazis always pretended that they were, the focal point of world history. Their survival is insepara- ble from the survival of culture itself. 16 But, if this is indeed the case, we might ask, does this not affect the argu- ment of Dialectic of Enlightenment as a whole? Was Adorno's later recol- lection that the "Elements" were merely a bridge to The Authoritarian Personality, a mis-remembering of its status at the time? Do the "Ele- ments" contain, as Wiggershaus suggests, the "hidden center" of the book? At first glance this seems to be historically implausible, since there was little attention to anti-Semitism during the first few months of work on what they then called the "dialectic book." Nor was anti-Semitism mentioned in the internal Institute memoranda at the time. "It appeared," Wiggershaus comments, "as if Horkheimer and Adorno were still afraid of this theme."17 No doubt a decision to shift the focus of critical theory from the traditional Marxist questions of monopoly capitalism or class conflict to the fate of the Jews would have produced skepticism among some the Institute's more orthodox Marxist contributors, like Franz Neu- mann, for example, who wrote Adorno in 1940 that "I can imagine, and I have done this in my book, that one can represent National Socialism without attributing to the Jewish problem a central role."18 Yet even if the "Elements" were composed after the other sections were complete, and even if it was never preordained to be part of Dia- lectic of Enlightenment, Horkheimer had in fact proposed to Adorno much earlier that the fate of the Jews and not the fate of the "bourgeois subject" could indeed be the focal point of their joint enterprise: "How 16.

That would mean the concretizing and limiting which we have been search- ing for. It would also permit us to activate a large part of the co-work- ers of the institute. Whereas, if we were to write something like a critique of the present measured by the category of the individual, I can already imagine the nightmare that Marcuse would then demon- strate that since the early bourgeois era the category of the individual contained progressive and reactionary tendencies. Also, anti-Semitism today really marks the focal point of injustice, and our physiognomy must turn to the world where it shows its most horrible face. Finally, the question of anti-Semitism is the one that best fits into the effective complex that we are writing about, without our having revealed any- thing about it [ohne dass wir dariiber etwas verrieten]. 9 The death of Benjamin and the arrival of his philosophical testament provided Horkheimer and Adorno, as Wiggershaus notes, with a kind of "guiding star" around which the constellation of themes - the fate of the exile, the fate of the Jews, and the catastrophe of civilization - that ultimately make up Dialectic of Enlightenment could be organized. In August 1940 Adorno wrote to Horkheimer: "It often seems to me, as if all that, which we were used to seeing in terms of the proletariat, has today shifted with terrible intensity to the Jews. I ask myself, though it is not completely consistent with the project, if the things, which we actually want to say should not be said in connection with the Jews, who represent the counterpoint to power."20 And, Horkheimer wrote to the British political philosopher Harold Laski in 1941: "As true as it is that one can understand Anti-Semitism only from our society, as true it appears to me to become that by now society itself can be properly understood only through anti-Semitism."21 Horkheimer also emphasized the implicit connection between the story of Odysseus as the first modem individual and the theme of over- coming sacrifice in the first chapter, which, he said, "will probably play a dominant role in the psychology of anti-Semitism."22 As Odysseus resists regression into the boundaryless world of magic and matriarchy, the modem epic of the homelessness, exile, and 19.

In his adventure, modem subjectivity is constituted in the epic narrative by the figure who "by his cunning and reason escapes prehistory."23 Yet the price of this "escape" is to initiate the ritual of sacrifice, the subordination of the instincts that occurs in the imitatio of the power of the gods over nature, the "introversion of sacrifice." Reason outwits myth only when it sacrifices itself. As Adorno explained in his Habilitation on Kierkeg- aard, "all sacrifice in the domain of consciousness assumes the form of the paradoxical."24 However complex, "the sacrifice of consciousness is carried out according to its own categories, rationally."25 The first chapter of Dialectic of Enlightenment is an attempt to recon- struct the genealogy of sacrifice through an analysis of the fate of mimesis: first in the order of animistic identification, then in magic, subsequently in myth, and finally in reason. At each of these stages the concept of mimesis is not understood as mere imitation, but as a form of mimicry or semblance that appropriates rather than replicates its object in a non-identical similitude. Following Freud's Totem and Taboo (1912), Horkheimer and Adorno regarded mimesis as directly connected to the substitution that occurs in ritual sacrifice, the appeasement of the gods with an animal that is both representative and surrogate; the "non-specificity of the example," already marks a step toward discursive logic" (DE 10). Freud placed great emphasis on how "identification with the totem is carried into effect" by various forms of mimicry, "dressing in the skin of the ani- mal, by incising a picture of the totem upon his own body, and so on."26 In Freud's conception, the "fetish" enacts the dialectic of non- identity by "splitting the ego" while preserving both symbolic and real components, knowing and not-knowing.27 In the ascent from mana, the 23.

Mimesis is not the suppression of difference but an act of substitution that intervenes between the helpless subject and the overpowering object: it appears in the frozen terror with which all living creatures react to fear, in the magician's impersonation of demons, in his gestures of appease- ment to the gods, or in the wearing of masks which guarantee that the identity of self "cannot disappear through identification with another"(DE 10). Semblance preserves the possibility of freedom, of a resistance to the assimilation of the concept in much the same way that in Kierkeg- aard's theology "enciphered images oppose the existential sacrifice."28 In Dialectic of Enlightenment the modem principle of calculability and equivalence is already prefigured by a growing abstraction and dis- tance from nature that occurs first in the "specific" duplication of anthropomorphism, in the "non-specific" sacrifice, and ultimately in the unification of myth as the sovereignty of the human subject over nature. Yet at the same time, mimesis is a step away from discursive logic in its preservation of the concrete, sensual, and thinglike substance which is the very opposite of the liquidation of subjectivity in the symbol or concept in Adorno's analysis of intellectual sacrifice. Mimesis therefore represents both the prefiguration of, and the "other" of reason. But mimesis itself undergoes repression in the act of subjugating nature to instrumental reason: "The ratio, which represses mimesis, is not simply its opposite. It too is mimesis: mimesis of death" (O 121). As the "Ele- ments" notes, anti-Semitism is "the counterpart of true mimesis and fundamentally related to the repressed form; in, fact it is probably the morbid expression of repressed mimesis. Mimesis imitates the environ- ment, but false projection makes the environment like itself"(DE 187). These quotations demonstrate the deep connection of the passage from mimesis to reason, and from reason to that kind of mimesis (not simply its opposite) that infuses modernity with the compulsion to sub- jugate, imitate, and annihilate. Nonetheless, there is a theological (and aesthetic residue) in the concept of mimesis that holds out the possibil- ity of a different kind of appropriation, one which does not do violence to its object, which retains the recognition of its distinctiveness through 28. Adorno, Kierkegaard 133.</page><page sequence="9">Anson Rabinbach 57 the activation of inauthenticity, in play, in irony, or in the cunning that Adorno and Horkheimer identified with Odysseus. Like Freud, Horkheimer and Adorno identified the Bilderverbot, the taboo on figuration in Jewish monotheism, as the event that inaugurates modernity. By proscribing the direct personification of the Gods, ritual substitution and sacrifice is converted into law. For Freud the monothe- istic prohibition on images transformed Judaism into a religion of instinctual renuciation "for it signified subordinating sense perception to an abstract idea; it was a triumph of Geistigkeit over sensuality."29 The Jews, Horkheimer and Adorno continued, crossed the threshold from mythology to rationality by converting the image into a series of duties in the form of ritual: the Jews "transformed taboos into civilizing max- ims when others still clung to magic"(DE 186). Following Moses and Monotheism, Horkheimer and Adorno argued that Christianity failed to sustain the purity that Judaism had achieved, that it descended into polytheism and mother god worship: "the Jews seemed to have suc- ceeded where Christianity failed: they defused magic by its own power - turned against itself as ritual service of God. They have retained the aspect of expiation but have avoided the reversion to mythology which symbolism implies"(DE 186).30 However, even in the "disenchanted world of Judaism," Horkheimer and Adorno wrote, the power of mime- sis is still expressed in the "bond between name and being" that is rec- ognized in "the ban on pronouncing the name of God"(DE 23). The next passage succinctly states their central argument: The disenchanted world of Judaism is reconciled with magical thought through its negation in the idea of God. The Jewish religion does not tolerate any word that offers solace to despair in the face of mortality. It associates hope only with the prohibition against calling what is false God, against invoking the finite as the infinite, lies as truth. The guarantee of redemption lies in the rejection of any belief that would subscribe to this; it is knowledge obtained in the denunciation of mad- ness [.... ] The legitimacy [Recht] of the image is salvaged [Gerettet] in the faithful carrying out of this prohibition. (DE 24) To sum up: the Jewish proscription on images, the Bilderverbot is at 29. Freud, Moses and Monotheism, trans. James Strachey, (London: Hogarth, 1939) 113.

Redemption can only be salvaged by a thinking that radically refuses any compromise with magical practices, myth, or the transposi- tion of worldly events into symbols. Fascism is the mirror opposite of the prohibition on mimesis, an archaic world of inauthenticity and terror masquerading as authenticity, heroism, and "being-in-the world." For Adorno and Horkheimer there is no "outside" of enlightenment once image and knowledge are completely severed. No "authentic experience" can artificially restore the world of mimesis, but in a radically disen- chanted world, mimesis is not imitatio but self-conscious "inauthentic- ity." Inauthenticity is a ruse, an act of "cunning," for example in the ritual sacrifice, in the amalgamation of sacrifice and totemism that dispenses with the need for actual murder: the "stupidity of the ritual" serves "the cleverness of the weaker." In the same way, works of art both preserve the utopian remembrance of the world before the prohibition and enact the illusion of its overcoming: "the capacity of representation is the vehicle of progress and regression at one and the same time" (DE 35). During their initial conversations in the winter of 1939, it was Oedi- pus and not Odysseus who came to mind as the figure who fuses the identity of selfhood with property and power. But the story of Odysseus took center stage since Oedipus's defenseless blindness to his fate could not compete with the Homeric hero's successful evasion of the presym- bolic and premythical world of identity through cunning and deception. If, as Adorno asserted in Minima Moralia, all that is human is "indis- solubly linked to imitation," any claim to genuineness is ultimately dis- ingenuous. Theology adopts the "likeness" of self to God, but never assumes its identity. As opposed to the idea of genuineness and authen- ticity, the "self should not be spoken of as the ontological ground, but at most theologically, in the name of its likeness to God." 31 The mimetic world of fascism - with its alluring images, rituals, symbols - points to the destructive and deceptive potential of mimetic identification with nature. That side of mimesis was suggested to Adorno by a curious text which played an important if peripheral role in the discussions out of which Dialectic of Enlightenment emerged: La mante religieuse. Recher- che sur la nature et la signification du mythe by the French anthropolo- gist Roger Caillois. Caillois was a leading figure of the College de 31.

Adorno was drawn to this book because of its emphasis on the mimetic impulse in nature, an impulse that was all the more uncanny because Caillois dem- onstrated that the female mantis actually devours the male during inter- course. It is this negative dimension of mimesis, the eradication of the vital difference between life and matter, or the organic and inorganic in the sexual act, that suggested the theme of annihilation (and not insignif- icantly, the gendering of fascist identification as matriarchal in origin). Caillois's account of mimesis, Adorno remarks, does not distinguish between playing and being dead. But in a letter to Benjamin, he explained that he admired the fact that Caillois did not operate at the level of myth, but instead focused on the residues of a kind of primal biological memory of "psychasthenia" in human behavior, Caillois derived from the "materialism that he has in common with Jung and cer- tainly with Klages," and from a "cryptofascist belief in nature. Adorno was fascinated by the ways in which mimesis could lead to a "fatal attraction" that literally annihilates the object of its of desire, which was not unlike the analysis of theological sacrifice we have already dis- cussed. Adorno's analysis of anti-Semitism in Dialectic of Enlighten- ment, as we shall see, adopts the same strategy, locating in modem Jew hatred the return of the archaic impulse to mimesis, however, in its "repressed form" [Verdriingte Mimesis] which in its paranoid fear, imi- tates and liquidates the Jew, all the more consequentially. Unlike mime- sis, whose illusion is self-conscious, repressed mimesis always contains a principle of self-deception and destruction: "this form of repressed mimesis and the destructive are the same - the no-longer-self-hood."32 In September 1940 Adorno sent Horkheimer "a couple of - com- pletely unformulated - thoughts on the theory of Anti-Semitism." "We have arrived at a really important place," Adorno wrote, "namely, at a unified and non-rationalistic explanation for anti-Semitism." Adorno's analysis is something of an imaginary prehistory of the Jews, with its emphasis on their persistence in a nomadic existence long after the world consisted of permanent settlements. As "the secret gypsies of history," the Jews are a "prematriarchal" people whose lack of ties to the earth and to a fixed locale, always threatened to subvert the ideals of civilized life: home, family, labor. From the standpoint of other peoples "the image of the Jew represented a stage of humanity which did not yet know labor, 32. GS 12: 591.</page><page sequence="12">60 Anti-Semitism in Dialectic of Enlightenment and all later attacks on the parasitic, thieving character of the Jews were mere rationalizations." Here the Jews represent, in an argument that eventually finds its way into the "elements," not the "colonizers of progress," nor the purveyors of a universal enlightenment, but the very refusal to be "civilized" and submit to the primacy of labor. The Jews' collective remembrance of a "land of milk and honey" is the "Jewish uto- pia." The taboo on that image - which, presumably the Bilderverbot ini- tiates - is simultaneously the taboo on the recalling of a nomadic existence and is, according to Adorno, "the origin of anti-Semitism."33 In the Odysseus essay, written just one year later, we find further clues to the suspicion that the nomadic Odysseus is not merely the pri- mordial "subject," the bourgeois in nuce, but also the Hellenic proto- type of Ahasverus, the wandering Jew. Odysseus reveals "the fate that the language of the cunning man, the middleman brings down on him- self." He is described in terms that suggest the stereotype of the Jewish tradesman: he is a rootless wanderer, physically weak, deceitful, and babbles incessantly. In his excessive attachment to speech, to language, Homer embodies in his hero, as does the eternal Jew, "the disaster that the enlightened word brings down on itself"'(0 132). The "Semitic ele- ment" of the Odyssey is also suggested in a footnote which echoes the theme that Odysseus, "the feudal lord, bears the trace of the oriental merchant"(0 125). Not incidentally, the "Elements" describes the Jews as "die ersten Bilrger"(DE 186). As Horkheimer and Adorno point out, it is of little consequence whether the Jews really do have the "mimetic features" attributed to them: "when all the horror of prehistory which has been overlaid with civilization is rehabilitated as rational interest by projection onto the Jews, there is no restriction" (DE 186). This suggests a connection to Adorno's provisional 1940 theses: that the Jews are sacrificed as the ulti- mate victims of the taboo on mimesis for having inflicted the taboo on civilization. Civilization, they argue, replaces "mimetic behavior proper, by organized control of mimesis" and ultimately by prescribing rational practice, by work. "Uncontrolled mimesis is expunged first in the reli- gious prohibition on idolatry, on images of god, subsequently in the gen- eral contempt for all image bound wanderers: nomads, actors, gypsies, and finally in rationalization which "consigns to oblivion "the indelible 33.

The murder of the Jews is a form of revenge for civilization's triumph over nature; those who first turned ritual sacrifice into rationality by carrying out the prohi- bition are themselves sacrificed as the expression of "repressed mime- sis" (DE 187). The Jews represent not only the carriers of the taboo on mimesis, but also those who have not entirely succumbed to its logic. This analysis should make us uneasy for two reasons. First, the pas- sages on "idiosyncrasy and mimesis" betray a strong trace of Caillois's theories of the natural substratum of these motifs, which seem to locate anti-Semitism in what Horkheimer and Adorno called "biological Urge- schichte" (DE 180). Anti-Semitism is not, as the conventional argu- ments go, either the result of Christian Jew-hatred or modem scientific racial thinking, but emerges at the very threshold of human evolution. As Adorno remarked during the their discussions, anti-Semitism is a form of "idiosyncratic behavior" (idiosyncrasy) which evokes the "desire for that situation, in which such reactions as being paralyzed with fear still existed, that is the desire for mimicry."34 Freud once referred to this approach, very like his own, as a "phylogentic fantasy" of a set of inherited mechanisms which primeval humanity developed in its confrontation with the terrors of nature. As if in flight from exces- sively time-bound Marxist and psychoanalytic theories of anti-Semit- ism, they embraced a theory of the origins of anti-Semitism in a timeless reaction to the terror of the overpowering force of nature. Mimicry is rooted in fear, in the impulse to become like nature by hardening one- self against it. It is an "archaic stigmata of the urge to survive"(DE 188). Anti-Semitism is ultimately the last social refuge of the mimetic impulse: "The mental energy harnessed by political anti-Semitism is this rationalized idiosyncrasy" (DE 183). In anti-Semitism the "aborigi- nal" desire to return to the "mimetic practice of sacrifice finds its ulti- mate fulfillment" (DE 186). It is ultimately not clear whether this version of primal anti-Semitism can usefully distinguish modem rac- ism, Christian Jew-hatred (ancient or primordial), anti-Judaism, or whether - in the end - it has anything to do with the Jews at all. One can almost imagine a group of Neanderthals blaming the latest volca- nic eruption on the Jews, even if they did not yet exist. Nor is it possi- ble to distinguish totalitarian anti-Semitism from "bourgeois" anti- Semitism or American racial prejudice. Horkheimer himself later admit- 34.

In contrast to the image of the Jews in the first chapter, where, in Freud's words, they secure "a triumph of Geistigkeit over sensuality," the Jews appear in the "Elements" in a more ambivalent light, as those who impose the taboo on mimesis and as the carriers of a "premythological," "prematriarchal," residue. Adorno's thesis that anti-Semitism preserves the image of Jews as "nomadic" explicitly identified them, not merely with the perpetra- tion of the taboo, but with the refusal to adapt to it. The Jews embody both the process of civilization and the sins of capitalism, and with the refusal to accommodate to civilizing maxims. Totalitarian domination is hostile to the Jews because "no matter what the Jews as such may be like," they represent "happiness without power, wages without work, a home without frontiers, religion without myth"(DE 199). That idea, which is the very opposite of Freud's conviction that Christianity was in fact a regression from Judaism, can be found, as Josef Yerushalmi shows, in Carl Gustav Jung's 1934 infamous attack on Freud's "soulless rationalism." There we find Jung's ruminations on the creative energies of the Aryan unconscious and his claim that the Jew, "who is something of a nomad, has never yet created a cultural form of his own."36 Horkheimer, of course, did not share Jung's ennobling of the Aryan spirit, but rather drew parallels between the Jewish and German prehis- tory: "Both peoples were originally nomads, e.g., pastoral tribes, and both are intensely patriotic, though in very different ways: However, if both Germans and Jews show a militant sort of patriotism, the patrio- tism of the Jews is characterized by a longing for the soil which was lost, while the Germans want to possess soil they never possessed."37 Although Horkheimer and Adorno emphasized in an Institute memo- randum that "anti-Semitic feelings are not aroused by Jewish behavior, but by prejudice pure and simple," their correspondence indicates that 35.

Horkheimer was in fact preoccupied with the opposite possibility, that at a much deeper level the Jews were not merely an arbitrary target of economically or psychoanalytically rooted "scapegoatism." As he wrote to L6wenthal about the "Theses" in March 1944: "I am particularly eager to know my answer to your question as to why the Jews are such an appropriate object of projection. I think, I referred to mimesis, but there was some- thing else too."38 Recall that Horkheimer had remarked that, "wittingly or unwittingly," the Jews had become the martyrs of civilization. His remark sheds light on the persistent theme that it is in fact the very success of the Jews in perpetrating the "civilisatory virtues" that is the ultimate reason for their sacrifice.39 "The Jews have been the pioneers of civilization. Their recent history is deeply interconnected with the progress of indus- try, commerce, and science. Their existence is a constant challenge to those who want to be lazy. The Jews are the competitors par excel- lence."40 As the war drew to an end, Horkheimer asserted that "objec- tive" factors were at work, and that anti-Semitism was elicited by the Jews, e.g., when he says that though he is speaking of the "partly invol- untary role of the Jews," it "is good to remember that the slight lack of assimilation in our assimilated Jewish individuals consists exactly of the unflinching readiness and impatience to outdo all bystanders in just that society which has no pity for the dumb.'41 The "Elements" also reiter- ates Freud's thesis that it is ultimately "the special character" of the Jew- ish religion that has made the Jews and the anti-Semites what they are, and that it is ultimately Christian self-hatred, the displacement of Chris- tian resentment at the constraints of monotheism and the desire to over- turn the ban on images and return to paganism, that accounts for the persistence of hatred and the belief in a Jewish conspiracy. "The reflec- tive aspect of Christianity, the intellectualization of magic, is the root of evil" (DE 177). Jewish self-confidence, optimism, and what Freud called the "secret treasure" of the Jewish people, that they regard themselves as superior to other peoples, turns into the anti-Semitic belief in a secret Jewish power. "They are branded absolute evil by those who are abso- lutely evil, and are now, in fact the chosen people" (DE 168). For the theorists of the Frankfurt School the catastrophe of the Jews 38.

The fascist return to what they called "mimetic modes of existence," was the ultimate price of civilization. But as dark as their tale might have been, it wasbstill not the last chapter. As Odysseus replaced Oedipus because his wit permitted him to evade the fate to which Oedipus blindly succumbed, Horkheimer and Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment was an effort to philosophically outwit myth, and to create "the possibility of escape" through enlightenment sensitized to the power of mimesis. This conclusion, that only the end of the dialec- tic of enlightenment can make anti-Semitism disappear, makes explicit the connection between the first chapter and the "Elements": "if thought is liberated from domination and if violence is abolished, the long absent idea is liable to develop that Jews too are human beings. This development would represent the step out of an anti-Semitic soci- ety which drives Jews and others to madness, and into the human soci- ety. This step would also fulfill the Fascist lie, but in contradicting it: the Jewish question would prove in fact to be the turning point of his- tory" (DE 199-200). In this respect Horkheimer and Adorno may have succeeded despite the multiple sins of their analysis of anti-Semitism. As Hermann Broch wrote after he read one of the first copies of Phil- osophische Fragmente: "The fact that a book like the Philosophical Fragments can exist at all attests to the powers of self-reflection of the intellect [Ratio], about which it might at first glance be asked, whether it doesn't penetrate far more deeply than it might think, and whether it might not itself be counted as a signpost of the reawakening of the impulse to life and civilization. It is still not decided whether the death drive has won the definitive upper hand over the drive to life."42 42. Hermann Broch to Horkheimer, 2 Oct. 1945 GS 17: 654.</page></plain_text>
