<plain_text><page sequence="1">MYTH AND SOCIETY IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF BERGSON BY ELLIS SANDOZ jT'll philosophy, for Henri Bergson, begins with the funda- mental experience of real duration: that is, with an awareness that the time of the human psychic life is pure change, an endless continuity of becoming, an uninterrupted upsurge of novelty.1 Through the faculty memory, mental life goes on swelling with the duration it has accumulated. "All that we have felt, thought and willed from earliest infancy is there, leaning over the present which is about to join it, pressing against the portals of conscious- ness that would fain leave it outside" (Creative Evolution, note 1, pp. 2, 4, 5). The whole past of the individual is made known through an impulse, a tendency to act in one way or another; although only a small portion of this past will find any representa- tion in conscious ideas (Creative Evolution, note 1, p. 5). The concept of duration is the symbol by which Bergson repre- sents his intuition of Being. By attaining the awareness of one's own duration, we are brought "into contact with a whole con- tinuity of durations," and, by a process of expanding our intuition and of reflecting upon it, "we can extend ourselves indefinitely by an increasingly violent effort" and so transcend ourselves. 2 It is through this fundamental experience of transcendence that the whole of Bergson's thought is focused. This is the lens through which all of reality must be seen, and we find him returning again and again to explicate and elaborate this experience and its precise character.

But one must be aware, also, of the essentially biological method he employs in explicating this experience and in applying himself to the reformulated problems of metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. It is, of course, beyond the scope of this essay to treat Bergson's entire philosophy, but a summary statement of his position is essential. The Theoretical Setting Bergson's discovery of concrete duration was brought about largely as a reaction to Spencerian evolutionism and what he con- ceived to be Kantian relativism. This insight dated from 1884, when Bergson was twenty-five years old.3 He was struck by the Kantian critique of human knowledge which reduced all that we know to representations of things as the human intellect would have them to be. The human intellect, said Kant, imposed its form upon matter as presented to the senses, thereby bringing it into agreement with intelligence and making the realm of the in- tellectual co-extensive with that of the knowable. The thing-in- itself, therefore, remains unknown; and the intellect apprehends only the refraction of the thing through our atmosphere. A knowl- edge of things-in-themselves could only be achieved through some extra-intellectual faculty such as intuition; in the absence of this faculty all knowledge is relative to man's understanding and meta- physics is impossible. Kant then denies the existence of such a faculty in man. {Creative Evolution, note 1, p. 356. This is Bergson's understanding of Kantianism and not my own. There are other views.) Spencerian evolutionism seemed, at first, to avoid this relativism. Here was proposed an examination of the genesis of life; a study of the evolution of living forms. In fact, however, the result was far from a study of unfolding and becom- ing, of the vital movement which is the essence of evolution. 3 Albert Thibaudet, "Bergson, Henri," Encyclopedia Britannica (Chicago, 111: University of Chicago Press, 1947), vii, p. 435.</page><page sequence="3">BERGSON ON MYTH AND SOCIETY 173 Spencerism was a pseudo-evolutionism that posited matter and intelligence as they are today, then undertook to piece together the fragments of the past by an external analysis of the present. (Creative Evolution, note 1, pp. 188; 363-370). "So," says Bergson, "... by combining together the most simple results of evolution, you may imitate well or ill the most complex effects; but of neither the simple nor the complex will you have retraced the genesis, and the addition of evolved to evolved will bear no resemblance whatever to the movement of evolution" (Creative Evolution, note 1, p. 364). Bergson's answer to Kantianism, or at least a portion of that answer, was that there are two "profoundly different ways of knowing a thing." "The first implies that we move round the object; the second that we enter into it. The first depends upon the point of view at which we are placed and the symbols by which we express our- selves. The second neither depends on a point of view nor relies on any symbol. The first kind of knowledge may be said to stop at the relative; the second, in those cases where it is possible, to attain the absolute" (note 2, p. 111). Relative knowledge is the knowledge attained by the intellect, a knowledge that is sought for its utility to man and which enables him to manipulate matter and, thereby, to control it and act upon it. Intellect, therefore, furnishes man with scientific knowledge which is systematically formulated into a variety of symbolic representations. The postulation of the uniformity of nature, that is, the effective denial of change, enables the construction of closed systems wherein symbols (of greater or lesser abstraction and generalization) are substituted for the relations that they are held to represent and which are interconnected logically. This is the knowledge of analysis which imposes the geometrical bent of the human intellect upon nature and reconstructs it as a geometrical and static order. Thus far Bergson and Kant are in essential agreement about rela-</page><page sequence="4">174 SOCIAL RESEARCH tive knowledge. But what Kant fails to recognize is that, the further scientific analysis moves from inert matter and the more life becomes its object of inquiry, the more insufficient and inade- quate analysis becomes as a mode of explanation. This is for no other reason than that intellect presupposes stability, and life is pure mobility (Creative Evolution, note 1, p. 364). The goal of scientific or relative knowledge is measurement of matter and the comparison of different measurements with a view toward subsequent action. The goal of absolute or meta- physical knowledge is to be in sympathy with reality without any thought of relation and comparison. The analytic method of the former is appropriate for the study of matter and the intuitive method of the latter for the study of mind. "In the first case one is dealing with spatialized time and with space; in the second with real duration." (Creative Mind, "Notes" to "An Introduction to Metaphysics," pp. 200; 305). Bergson thus postulates what Kant has explicitly denied; namely, an extra-intellectual intuition which is the source of metaphysical knowledge. More than this, the knowledge that the intellect gives us of matter tends to become, in Creative Evolution, not at all relative (at least in the Kantian sense); but, rather, only approximate. This position may be maintained by, first of all, ". . . regarding the intellect as a special function of mind, essen- tially turned toward inert matter; then in saying that neither does matter determine the form of the intellect, nor does the in- tellect impose its form on matter, nor have matter and intellect been regulated in regard to one another by we know not what pre- established harmony, but that intellect and matter have pro- gresssively adapted themselves one to the other in order to attain at last a common form. This adaption has, moreover, been brought about quite naturally, because it is the same movement which creates at once the intellectuality of mind and the material- ity of things" (Creative Evolution, note 1, p. 206). To replace the false evolutionism of Spencer, Bergson sets out to</page><page sequence="5">BERGSON ON MYTH AND SOCIETY 175 retrace the genesis of life itself. Through experience he draws closer to reality in order to follow it in its generation and growth. This experience is that of real duration, which "signifies both un- divided continuity and creation/' (Creative Evolution, note 1, p. xiv). The experience of the individual is extrapolated into a sympathetic experience of life in general. This intuitive expan- sion yields the concept of the elan vital which is pure consciousness and the essence of life. The elan vital (or vital impetus) is neither a mechanistic assembly of given parts, nor is it the fateful working out of a pre-ordained plan: it is, rather, pure consciousness posited and traversing matter, which is pure necessity - the one bringing life, the other resisting and forcing divergence. Hence, reality is unceasing creation, and life assumes a multiplicity of material- ized forms as consciousness attempts to thrust mobility and change into inert matter. The multiplicity of species is the proof of re- fractory matter's successes in opposing the limited power of the vital impetus. Nonetheless, in each of those dissociated elements that has forked away from the main current, there remains some- thing of the "primitive impetus of the whole," (Creative Evolution, note 1, p. 54) and this causes continued movement. ". . . life is of the psychological order, and it is of the essence of the psy- chical to enfold a confused plurality of interpenetrating terms" (Creative Evolution, note 1, p. 257). When viewed as a thing-in- itself (that is intuitively), the vital impetus is a simple tendency that leaps forward and creates at a stroke; the multiplicity and the complexity that the intellect discovers in living creatures are re- sults of intellectual analysis of manifestation and not of creative genesis. But, also, "the essence of a tendency [is] to develop in the form of a sheaf, creating by its very growth, divergent directions among which its impetus is divided" (Creative Evolution, note 1, p. 99). The elan vital is the force of cosmic evolution and its essential effect is to introduce into determinate matter the maximum of in- determination and liberty (Creative Evolution, note 1, p. 251). The impetus strives against matter to achieve this liberty in order</page><page sequence="6">176 SOCIAL RESEARCH to "accomplish infinitely varied kinds of work" (Creative Evolu- tion, note 1, p. 254). But its power is limited, and it is beset with obstacles that cause it to turn aside, to divide, and always to be op- posed. The first great scission of life was the creation of the two kingdoms, plant and animal. Then, within the animal kingdom, ever striving to free consciousness from matter and attain unlimited freedom of action, consciousness again divided into two great lines of animal evolution: the instinctive and the intelligent, the one culminating in the hymenoptera, the other in man. Such is Bergson's general position as that is important to our subject. The specific problem with which we have here to deal is the nature of society and the genesis of social order in what Bergson considers the non-rational. The nature of the sources of social order is consequent upon the nature of being in general and the nature of man. Thus far it is clear that Bergson's theory of the nature of being is cast in the language of a theory of life - indeed, all of reality converges in, or, rather, diverges with the elan vital. It is in a study of the nature of man that the origins and particular nature of human society must be sought. Bergson deals with these problems, as matters of direct concern, in his later work, The Two Sources of Morality and Religion, published in France in 1932. Theory of Human Nature The human species was evolved by nature in a sudden leap, or several such leaps, of life in the direction of intelligence and so- ciability.4 These are the essential characteristics of human nature as nature has produced it. Here nature stopped, leaving man to revolve in a circle, to progress no futher: in short, nature produced static man and granted to him a margin of development through intellect, but limited this development to a given sphere. The characteristic of intelligence is here the distinctive factor. This is * The Two Sources of Morality and Religion, trans. R. A. Audra and Cloudesley Brereton with the assistance of W. H.

But intelligence must be restrained for, left to itself, it promotes only the interests of the ego and ignores the needs of the society in which it lives. Thus, nature in order to preserve its creation and to curb this dangerous tendency of intellect, has provided intellect with a penumbra of instinct, a fringe of non-rational intuition. In the hymenoptera, instinct is the means for direct action upon raw matter and functions both as the tool by which life controls matter for its benefit and as the agent of social cohesion. In man, however, instinct is vestigial; it is a virtual instinct which is in- capable of directly and completely effecting the social solidarity ordained by nature. It has, therefore, to act indirectly, through representations made to the intellect (note 4, pp. 107 ff. 112). These representations are made by a faculty adjacent to the intellect, but not of the intellect, which is the fabulatory or myth- making function. This faculty is nothing more nor less than an agency for the production of voluntary hallucination which the intellect mistakes for real experience (note 4, p. 184). It contrives "a systematically false experience" that confronts the intelligence and serves to stop it from pushing too far "the conclusions it de- duces from true experience" (note 4, p. 99). These false ex- periences, as elaborated by the myth-making function, usually take the form of religious representations. Here is manifested the "common sense" or "social sense" of man; it is "innate in normal man, like the faculty of speech, which also implies the existence of society and which nonetheless is prefigured in the individual organism" (note 4, p. 96). This is human nature as nature herself has posited it: a human nature intended for closed, simple societies (note 4, p. 48). But there is another human nature that nature has not foreseen and which it was beyond the limited power of the elan vital to produce on earth. For, the "impetus inherent in life is, like life, finite" (note 4, p. 49). This is the nature of the soul that has violently wrested itself from the stop which marked the creation of the</page><page sequence="8">178 SOCIAL RESEARCH human species and has opened itself into the vital impetus of creativity. Between the closed and the opened soul there is a difference of kind, of "vital tone (note 4, p. 50); "... a body com- pact of creative intelligence, and, round about that intelligence, a fringe of intuition, was the most complete thing nature had found it possible to produce. Such was the human body. There the evolution of life stopped" (note 4, p. 301). This is the human species as created by nature. It is the same today as when it was first evolved. With the creation of the species man, his entire nature was posited. Thus defined, human nature remains, as it is manifest in new individuals, unaltered by the passage of time; it is the material upon which human nature must act that gives the illusion of the evolution of modern man from primitive man. Acquired characteristics are not hereditary; the change from "primitive" to "modern" man is the change that is wrought through the residuum of experience preserved by a society. The "change" in modern man is nothing more than natural man educated at the hands of a social order standing atop the accretions of thousands of years of history. Modern man and primitive man are the same; it is the conditions of social existence that have changed (note 4, pp. 260-61). Yet, in time, there appear exceptional individuals who transcend the limitations imposed on the species by its material nature, who contact and become partially coincident with the creative impetus of which life is a manifestation. "This effort is of God, if it is not God himself" (note 4, p. 209). These exceptional individuals are the great mystics. They break the posited circle in which the species revolves and remains static: the individuals making up society by their grouping together and society shaping the individ- uals by being prefigured in them. The mystic, in his experiences of transcendence, attains, through a profound emotional experi- ence, a unity with the generative principle of all life (note 4, pp. 188, 202-3). In pure mysticism, "it is God who is acting through the soul, in the soul; the union is total, therefore final" (note 4, p. 220). There is an exuberance of joy, a super-abundance of life,</page><page sequence="9">BERGSON ON MYTH AND SOCIETY 179 boundless impetus: the soul is "action, creation, love" (note 4, pp. 214, 221). Thus there is a "getting back to God," and with it love over-flowing and boundless energy (note 4, p. 246). The human is transfigured and becomes the divine, this finding its expression in superabundant energy of action.5 In the field of action, the mystic displays that "supreme good sense" that enables him easily to adapt himself to new situations, to discern what is possible and what is impossible to achieve in a given situation, and to triumph over all complexity through a spirit of ingenuous simplicity (note 4, p. 217). It is this capacity for such supra-intellectual emotions that con- stitutes the advance beyond what nature has posited as human nature. But, also, the dynamic soul is more than nature has for- seen because it has taken advantage of the extraordinary develop- ment of the intellect which has enabled man more and more com- pletely to subdue the materiality which has always restricted the vital impetus. Thus man has virtually freed himself of the re- strictions of materiality (note 4, p. 301). The freedom that static man enjoyed (by virtue of the fact that he controlled matter through an intellect which provided him with a choice of al- ternatives to action), thus, is transformed into that pure freedom which is divine action and untold optimism (note 4, p. 221). Implicit within each of these concepts of human nature is a concept of society; at either extreme are, respectively, the closed society of static religion and the open society of dynamic religion. Each of these forms finds its source in the non-rational: the closed society in the infra-rational fabulatory function, the open society in the supra-rational experience of transcendence. The Closed Society The closed society is the society posited by nature, the consequence of the sociability prefigured in human nature. The good of this o From the mystic's "increased vitality there radiated an extraordinary energy, daring power of conception and realization," (note 4, p. 216).</page><page sequence="10">180 SOCIAL RESEARCH society and of this sociability is the preservation of the life of the species: intelligence serves to subject matter to control by life and the virtual instinct of sociability provides a curb to the egoism of intellect (note 4, p. 19). Nature has endowed man with in- telligence; that is, with a tool-inventing and tool-using faculty. This corresponds to the pure instinct of the insects except that the latter are specialized to their tasks by a physical as well as a psychic equipment; with them there is no freedom, only pure necessity. The intelligence, on the other hand, is a faculty that allows hesitation and choice of means to selected ends, but there must be some mechanism of preservation which will insure the exercise of this freedom of action in accordance with the collective interest. In human society, this necessity of socially valuable ac- tion is enforced through social pressure. Society, in this regard, may be envisaged as analogous to an organism the cells of which are individuals who seek their own interests independently of one another, but who, nonetheless, subject themselves to the necessity of the whole (note 4, p. 18). The necessity of this conformity cannot be traced beyond the explanation that it is nature's intent, meaning by this that the "why" of this natural faculty can be answered only in terms of the function it serves. The experiential character of the fundamental factor of so- cial necessity can, however, be described. At the root of society lies totality of obligation, or obligation in general. Underlying this pure obligation is nature's necessity (note 4, p. 20). We must be careful to understand that this totality of obligation does not refer to any specific obligation. Man is by nature an intelligent being, and this intelligence implies a freedom of choice among a multiplicity of alternatives: some specific obligations may be slighted, some ignored altogether, but there can be no avoidance of all obligation. This totality of obligation is the feeling of duty which arises from man's "habit of contracting habits" (note 4, p. 18). This is the foundation of social morality and is a necessary condition to the existence of society. It has a "force comparable to that of instinct in respect of both intensity and regularity" (note</page><page sequence="11">BERGSON ON MYTH AND SOCIETY 181 4, p. 18). Each of the habits we derive from society tends to lend authority to each of the others, the whole to "form a solid block' ' (note 4, pp. 2, 3, 18). The "necessity of the whole" is "felt behind the contingency of the parts, " and this feeling is that of general moral obligation (note 4, p. 47). The instinct of the animals has given way to a system of habits which, taken individually, are con- tingent, their necessity lying in their convergence toward the preservation of society. Taken all together, therefore, they con- stitute a virtual instinct in man. An activity which starts as in- telligent and "progresses toward an imitation of instinct is exactly what we call in man, instinct" (note 4, p. 18). As has been intimated, this obligation takes the form of moral obligation to the intellect. Instead of the bald assertion of nature that "you must because you must/' (note 4, p. 17), however, the fabulatory function contrives elaborate representations for the in- tellect which we call myths. When taken together, these represen- tations of moral necessity comprise the doctrine of religion. There "has never been a society without a religion" (note 4, p. 92). 6 And these religions find their source in the instinctive action of men, in the "logic of the body" (note 4, p. 156) which precedes all con- ceptual representation and which the fabulatory faculty draws upon as the experimental basis of its formulae. These are the formulations of "static religion," of the religion which furthers nature's intention of preserving the life it has deposited in the species man. In short, this is the religion of the closed society. The effect of this mythological religion is to amalgamate society with nature and to give to the commands of society the efficacy of laws of nature. The way has already been prepared for this through man's habitual way of looking at things as directed by will and filled with intent. Static religion extends this disposition by making the commands of social authority arise from inscrutable cosmic forces (note 4, pp. 4, 5). Here, then, the gap is filled, and the tendency to make social order an imitation of the order ob- e The myth-making function stands to religion "in the relation of effect and not of cause" (note 4, p. 92).</page><page sequence="12">182 SOCIAL RESEARCH served in nature is consummated. But for the faculty of intelli- gence (which makes of men essentially free beings), human society would be identical with this natural order. Thus the character of pure obligation - and of the specific obligations which derive support from it - is intermediate between the personal and the im- personal in that it is generally derived from cosmic intention. Pure obligation enforces duty by compulsion. The religion of the closed society sustains morality by a cosmic authoritarianism. The nature of this obligation is more clearly seen if the genesis of its mythopoeic representation is traced. Whether in essence or by accident, religion always serves social ends. This phenomenon is co-extensive with the species and is, therefore, referable to an aspect of human psychic structure here called the fabulatory faculty (note 4, pp. 5, 92, 96, 166, 184-85). Human consciousness initially recognizes in the pervasive purposiveness of the cosmos no more than an efficient or effective presence (note 4, pp. 165, 170); there is no prior theoretical or conceptual representation: ". . . it is from a vital necessity that the primeval tendencies and convictions must have originated. " Conviction is forced upon man by vital impulsion; at first there is no philosophy (note 4, p. 167). Thus, says Bergson, ". . . out of some intermediate thing, intended rather to sustain the will than to inform the intelligence, there have emerged through dissociation, downwards and upwards, the forces that lie beneath the weight of magic, and the gods towards whom the voice of hu- man prayer is raised" (note 4, pp. 167-8). Magic in its genesis is concrete and undifferentiated; it is action that proceeds from the logic of the body and antedates any conceptual representation (note 4, p. 156). It may be resolved into two elements: on one hand, the desire of man to act upon a thing and work his own ends with it, even when it is out of reach; and, on the other hand, a natural assumption that things are filled with purpose, are charged with a human fluid and can be made to aid man in his private en- terprises if properly approached (note 4, p. 159). The first of these elements attains to the same end as does scientific knowledge and</page><page sequence="13">BERGSON ON MYTH AND SOCIETY 183 occupies a position of greater or lesser importance in a society ac- cording to the degree to which intelligence has mastered the prob- lems of material nature. The second element may be equated to the effective presence which is the "primitive and essential element of divinity" (note 4, p. 182) and lies "at the origin of religion" (note 4, p. 185). In its most compact impression upon reflective consciousness, therefore, primitive obligation is perceived as an action rather than as a person or thing (note 4, p. 177). Man first tries to in- fluence this action to his own account through the ritualistic ac- tivities of primitive magic; to this ritual activity, as a sort of verbal exegesis, the consciousness of man contrives the stories of primitive religion. Magic and religion are born together, implicit in human nature as life has posited the species. The fabulatory faculty fol- lows as an effect from religion: the stories it contrives are the ex- planations of nature's necessity to human intellect (note 4, p. 98).7 Just as, with life, action has preceded self-consciousness, so, with religion, ritual has preceded mythical representation. This explanatory imagery of the fabulatory faculty tends in the direction of polytheism. In the compact experience of an ef- fective presence, at the most rudimentary level, the spirit of the thing and the thing itself are not distinguished (note 4, p. 177). But the direction taken by mythopoeic imagination is toward com- plete personality and, from the feeling that there is an indwelling intention in things, it is only a step to represent this intention as multitudinous spirits (note 4, p. 172). Underlying all the great religions of ancient times (indeed, all popular religion ancient and modern), is this belief in spirits (note 4, pp. 170, 177). Stem- ming, as it does, from a foundation in action, animism easily fol- lowed as the next phase of religion's development toward increas- ingly personal objects of devotion. This is because the animal is both individual and typical: the animal is worshipped for some 7 For further study of this point and the relation of rite to myth, see the useful collection of studies in Thomas A.

It is, thus, easily adopted as the incarnation of a specific quality and thereby made a symbol of action: "In ancient Egypt the bull represented strength in battle; the lioness, destruction; the vulture, so careful of her young, motherhood" (note 4, p. 171). These variations on the two-fold theme of elementary animism and of magic (note 4, p. 176) are the basic components of static religion, or natural religion. From the fable-creating faculty that produced these primitive representations there emerged, through subsequent development, the complex mythology of the ancient religions. Around this mythology whole civilizations were reared - art, literature, and social institutions, all deriving sustenance from the myths of the society (note 4, pp. 176-77). But man's nature has not changed, and all popular religion still is based on a belief in spirits. "Homo sapiens, the only creature endowed with reason, is also the only creature to pin its existence to things unreasonable" (note 4, p. 92). The consummate contribution of the fabulatory function to the religion of the closed society was the elaborate polytheism that comprised the matured mythologies of ancient civilizations and which tended to merge into the worship of a single god. The gods of the pantheons of antiquity are strik- ingly different from their primitive antecedents. "The god is a person. He has his qualities, his defects, his character. He bears a name. He stands in definite relationship to other gods. He fulfills important functions and, above all, he is alone in fulfilling them" (note 4, p. 177). The most important of the actions represented as spirits are raised from this simple substantiality to the plane of complete personality. These gods are superadded to the spirits but do not supersede them for, though the gods are preferred by the more enlightened part of a nation, the cult of spirits remains the basis of popular religion (note 4, p. 177). To sum up, the static religion of the closed society is the ex- planation of living necessity that the fabulatory faculty gives in the symbolic form of the myth to the intellect. Within the depths of</page><page sequence="15">BERGSON ON MYTH AND SOCIETY 185 this religion is to be found the sociability of human nature which is posited by life when its evolution is halted by the creation of the human species. In the realm of pure action this sociability takes the form of the totality of obligation, or the habit of con- tracting habits. But man is a rational being, life having posited in him the power of choosing and inventing his means of action and of selecting the specific ends to which he shall manipulate matter. In order to keep this intelligence from pushing too far its conclusions - to the extent of depressing the individual with the foreknowledge of inevitable death or of destroying society by egoistic fragmentation - a non-rational fabulatory faculty con- fronts the intellect with systematically false experiences and ex- plains life's peremptory "you must because you must" in elaborate stories. Man tells these to himself and accepts them as true; this belief in their truth, in turn, serves to securely attach man to the life of his society and to compel him to obey its commands. Hence, the specific falsity but essential truth of myths. The function of static religion is, thus, twofold, and Bergson defines it &amp;s follows: "It is a defensive reaction of nature against what might be de- pressing for the individual, and dissolvent for society, in the ex- ercise of intelligence" (note 4, p. 194). The Open Society So far as nature had foreseen matters, humanity would go on re- volving on the axis set for it by the creative act; society would re- main closed. But man, in time, advanced beyond what would seem to have been the bounds contemplated by nature. The intellect developed beyond the limits allowed for by nature; and, in excep- tional men, the closed soul of social man has been burst open, the closure of society broken, and the obligations naturally imposed upon them transcended. From the moral obligation of pressure they have turned to a transcendent morality of aspiration; they have become filled with the pure creativity of divine love. Their morality becomes the morality of infinite love, and is no longer rooted in the compulsion to preserve a society; it is motivated,</page><page sequence="16">186 SOCIAL RESEARCH rather, by universal love and, through God, a brotherhood of man. These exceptional men, as we have indicated, are the mystics. The moral obligation they bring is the obligation of aspiration. These are the heroes who concentrate in themselves the highest moral qualities, and who affect the wills of men with the irre- sistible attraction of heroic action. Morality no longer depends for its effectiveness solely upon the pressure of society. It is a new morality which confronts mankind; one that transcends society, and which, in passing beyond the world of men, seeks a universal brotherhood of man in divine love. In the aspiration to attain this goal, the objectives and morality of earthly society are eclipsed and so far transcended as to be forgotten: a new, dynamic, and eternal obligation to act as an instrument of divine will floods the mystic soul and blinds it to lesser morality. A super-human in- tensity of purpose, power of speech, range of action, make clear by manifestation the transfiguration of the soul which has occurred through transcendental experience. The mystical experience wrenches the soul free from the circular existence of the closed society. The axis of human activity is left behind and the soul opens into the purity of divine activity: it is endless becoming, one with the elan vital. Thus the mystic, in an effort of the divinity, leaps forward to create that which nature could not have created. The mystic, who was mere man, becomes something more. The two great advances of humanity towards civilization have been: first, the gradual evolution of religion toward gods of marked personality, definitely inter-related, and tending to become merged into a single godhead; and second, the radical religious transformation that is the opening of the soul - the turning of the religious spirit from the outer to the inner, from the static to the dynamic (note 4, p. 168). The first of these advances ran its logical course to culminate in the mythologies of such antique civiliza- tions as Babylonia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. The second began with the advent of Christianity. It is only with Christianity that complete mysticism becomes possible. The Biblical representa-</page><page sequence="17">BERGSON ON MYTH AND SOCIETY 187 tion of Christ is the paradigm of mysticism: the great mystics are "the imitators, and original but incomplete continuators, of what the Christ of the Gospels was completely" (note 4, p. 228). With Him mysticism has its fullest expression, and the radical transfor- mation in man's relationship to God is consummated. The stern Jehovah of Israel - distant, forbidding, the champion of His peo- ple and ruthless in His protection of them - is transformed into the God of ineffable love and tenderness (note 4, p. 229). The intense paternalism of the Jehovah of the Old Testament is transformed into the universal love of the God of the New. The mythology of the Jews had been infused with passionate longing after justice by the prophets of the Old Testament and through Christ it was transfigured. Upon the bases of this mythology and of the heroic example of Christ mysticism has come to influence humanity at large. It is the task of the great mystics to "effect a radical transformation of humanity by setting an example" (note 4, p. 228); they "would fain draw humanity after them" (note 4, p. 265). Consciousness has been prepared for mysticism in the long heritage of mythologic belief. Through the medium of the myth the radical transforma- tion of the soul can engender the consciousness of men with at least the effects of transcendental experience. Thus, beginning with a tiny handful of men, the experience of the mystic (diluted to be sure) is translated into the experience of others; and from these into that of still others (note 4, p. 225). By this means the heroic story is told again and again; the souls of men feel the summons and many accept the challenge. Spiritual societies grow and multiply; a new religion is born. Its practices and ritual reflect the mythological religion which it succeeds, but ac- tion is re-oriented. Practice, which previously was aimed at main- taining the strength and solidarity of society, now seeks to engender attunement to the transcendental truth of being. The formulae and ritual of religion now become instruments for the populariza- tion of the transcendental experience of the mystic. In Western Christianity, this "high-level popularization" finds its context in</page><page sequence="18">188 SOCIAL RESEARCH the philosophy of Greece and in the imaginings of the ancient religions. As Bergson states it: "A doctrine which is but a doctrine has a poor chance indeed of giving birth to the glowing enthusiasm, the illumination, the faith that moves mountains. But grant this fierce glow, and the molten matter will easily run into the mould of a doctrine, or even become that doctrine as it solidifies. We represent religion, then, as the crystallization, brought about by a scientific process of cooling, of what mysticism had poured, while hot, into the soul of man. Through religion all men get a little of what a few privileged souls possessed in full" (note 4, p. 227). The open society of Bergson is, therefore, the society of man's brotherhood in God. Religion puts aside its paraphernalia of war- like provincialism, and becomes the repository of experiential symbols of transcendent Being and divinity. Human nature is transfigured and the species becomes "completely itself" through the initial efforts of individuals who expand the action of the soul to make it co-incident with divine action (note 4, pp. 246-47). The pressure of society, which has enforced habituation, pales into irrelevance as the joy of obligation through aspiration to divinity permeates the consciousness. Man's attachment to life is relieved of its focus on the life of a single society; it becomes attachment as broad and deep and intense as life itself. The whole of mysticism's contribution is that "God is love and the object of love" (note 4, p. 240). It is the experience of the mystic that man is created to receive the love of God and to love Him in return. Creation, from this viewpoint, is "God undertaking to create creators, that He may have, besides Himself, beings worthy of His love" (note 4, p. 243). Bergson resolves this discovery into the metaphysical context of the biological by stating that, matter and life being coexistent and interdependent, matter thereby be- came the necessity which forced tangible divergencies from the in- divisible harmony of life. This divergency of creativity enabled the satisfaction of God's need to love and to be loved: without a material universe through which to disperse the energy of life,</page><page sequence="19">BERGSON ON MYTH AND SOCIETY 189 there would have been no necessity of divergence, no reciprocity of love among God and worthy beings, and a need of divinity would have gone unfulfilled (note 4, pp. 246 ff.). Within history the opening of society has progressed through the Christian religion. The doctrine of Christianity is rooted in the mystical paradigm of Christ. Through the renewed impetus of individual mystics, there has been a gradual enrichment of the morality of society at large. The source of this gradual infusion is not (as the progressives would have us suppose) the rational ex- pansion of man's original morality from a love of family, to a love of city, then country, and, at last (in a burst of logical triumph), all of mankind. The source of this enrichment is, rather, a radically different one: it is the mystical experience of divine love, radiating its power among men. The dissemination of this new morality among all of mankind is a gradual process. Old forms of religion, as infused with the new morality, and the ancient ritualistic devices, as necessarily modified, are used to popularize the feeling of transcendence (note 4, pp. 260 ff.). Encroachment into the closed society natural to man proceeds but slowly, and at the bottom modern society still remains closed. The only political system to transcend this condition (at least in its intentions) is democracy. "It [democracy] confers on man inviolable rights. These rights, in order to remain inviolate, demand of all men an incorruptible fidelity to duty. It therefore takes for its matter an ideal man, who respects others as he does himself, inserting himself into obliga- tions which he holds to be absolute, making them coincide so closely with this absolute that it is no longer possible to say whether it is duty which confers the right or the right which im- poses the duty. The citizen thus defined is both 'lawmaker and subject/ as Kant has it. The citizens as a whole, the people, are therefore sovereign. Such is democracy in theory" (note 4, p. 270). There is another political order to which mysticism has con- tributed. This is the modern imperialist state. Here a sort of counterfeit mysticism adds "divine" impetus to nationalistic pur-</page><page sequence="20">190 SOCIAL RESEARCH pose. The old static religion has been borrowed and disguised as genuine dynamic religion. The garb of transcendent religion is used to advance the ends of a given society; the power of the One Supreme Being is felt to be exerted on the behalf of a chosen peo- pie. Bergson sees in the force of the mystical experience the impetus that can carry mankind back into the flow of life. The intellect of man has distended the body of man - that is, man's range of ef- fective action - beyond all proportion to his soul (note 4, p. 298). The result is that materiality hardly remains a limitation upon the scope of man's action. The successes of mechanization call for a bigger soul in man. Bergson believes this to be attainable in two ways: either through the appearance of some mystic hero to lead mankind beyond its natural bounds; or, through the systematic findings of a new science of the mind which would examine the nature of the spirit as exhaustively as the "science" of the past three hundred years has investigated the nature of matter (note 4, p. 298). In either case the stop that life sustained in the creation of man, and which has interrupted its flow through matter, would be resolved into renewed movement. "There is no obstacle which cannot be dealt with by wills sufficiently keyed up, if they deal with it in time" (note 4, p. 282). Bergson believes that historical determinism is powerless to control the inexorable advance of man- kind through the new science: "We do not believe in the fatality of history." Through either of these modes the simple joy of the soul opened to divinity would transfigure the feeling of security and satisfaction that nature provides through the closed society. The concluding sentences of The Two Sources of Morality and Religion read: "Men do not sufficiently realize that their future is in their own hands. Theirs is the task of determining first of all whether they want to go on living or not. Theirs the responsibility, then, for deciding if they want merely to live, or intend to make just the extra effort required for fulfilling, even on their refractory planet,</page><page sequence="21">BERGSON ON MYTH AND SOCIETY 191 the essential function of the universe, which is a machine for the making of gods (note 4, p. 306). Critical Summary Myth, by Bergson's accounting, is the symbolic form whereby man's intuitive grasp of the essentials of life is presented to con- scious intelligence. Its function is not speculation but evocation. Its objective is not explanation but concrete response or action. The feeling for vital being that myth is adequate to symbolize reaches its limits in the mythic formulations of polytheism. The revolution in human experience that yields dynamic religion, or the opening of the soul, renders myth inadequate to its essentially evocative function. But the problem does not end here. Not merely mythic symbolization, but any sort of representation of the experience of being becomes outmoded through the encounter with transcendent divine Being. Through the mystics, man is brought into confrontation with the ineffable God. That which is, by its very nature, unrepresentable must nonetheless be repre- sented; the unspeakable must be spoken of, the incommunicable communicated. This crisis and these paradoxes - reflected, for example, in Xenophanes' concern for the "seemliness of symbols" 8 - result in the partial eclipse of the old myth and its supersession by the new myth which becomes the prime vehicle for the symboli- zation of mystical experiences. The genesis of myth Bergson traces to man's instinctive aware- ness of his attachment to life. Myth springs from that element of the human psyche that feels man's vitality to be closely tied to the pulse of existence. It is the experience of man's involvement in the ebb and flow of life that finds expression in the systematically false stories of the myth-making or fabulatory function of mind. The systematic "falsity" of these myths lies in their particularity, in the activities and personages with which each deals; it does not 8C/.

Infra-rational intuition and supra-rational mysticism grasp truths essential to human life. These are formed as myths through the agency of the fabulatory function that operates over experiential material drawn from these two radically different sources to create what the self-con- scious intellect regards as representations. All myths, therefore, represent essential truths. Their sources in experience vary widely in terms of character and degree of differentiation, but all originate in compulsions to definite action. Bergson considers myth to be the doctrinal part of religion. In this capacity, he regards it as the essential factor that preserves life from destruction. Because its use is ineluctable, it has the addi- tional function in dynamic religion of evoking love of God. Myth, by false representations, convinces intellect of certain truths which insure that man's acts will, in general, redound to the benefit of himself and of the society to which he belongs and ultimately to all of mankind. It fashions the pervasive spirit of a society. In myth, man has distilled his profoundest insights into life's neces- sity; and it is through the beneficent function of myth that intellect is curbed from its destructive tendencies. The primary func- tion of myth is to preserve the posited order of nature among man- kind. This is achieved through the efficacy of primitive religions ranging in variety from mute dance ritual and primitive magic to the elaborate and ingenious polytheistic cults of the ancient civili- zations. The aim of myth is firm attachment to life, and its mode of operation is as an evocative symbol to intelligent man. It is through this function that all societies, in practice, are sustained. To a degree, and in a sense, the transformation of religious ex- perience effects what might be termed an emancipation from myth. Myth and polytheism are outdistanced together with the advent of Christian mysticism. The first mystic and the paradigm of all mysticism is the Christ of the Gospels. In Him the trans- figuration of the human soul is realized. He and subsequent mystics introduce a new morality of aspiration to transcendence.</page><page sequence="23">BERGSON ON MYTH AND SOCIETY 193 In this new morality, and in the religion that sustains it, there can be no adequate symbolization or representation. The old myths still are used and new ones are invented, but their function is re- vised and expanded from that of evoking action preservative of life to that of evoking love of God. The fabulatory contrivance that is most sufficient in the evocation of the new consciousness among men is the heroic story of the mystic. It is through this de- vice, principally, that the experiences of the mystics themselves are laid closest to the consciousness and experience of men. In a discussion of the problem of myth and religion, Ernst Cassirer makes the following remark with regard to Bergson's The Two Sources of Morality and Religion: "It is rather surprising that Bergson, whose doctrine has often been described as a biological philosophy, as a philosophy of life and nature, in his last work seems to be led to a moral and re- ligious ideal that goes far beyond this field/' 9 What was a "sur- prise" for Cassirer remains as a difficulty for the student and critic of Bergson. The inconvenience has been dealt with in more ways than one. The late work has been ignored altogether.10 It has been treated as though it fit perfectly well with his earlier work and there were no difficulty.11 And the earlier work has, in turn, been treated as though it fit perfectly well with the formulations of the Two Sources.12 The least blameworthy of these various re- actions is, perhaps, the last: Bergson himself has encouraged it. The source of the difficulty here is that, in the course of his philosophic life, Bergson has learned something. Surely this should be permitted by the critics! His life has been described 9 An Essay on Man (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1944), p. 88.

Precisely because of this, however, Bergson's work is unsystematic and inconsistent. It should be said in his defense, that Bergson rejected systematic philosophizing on principle. As Albert Thibaudet has pointed out (note 3), it was Bergson's conviction that to philosophize within the frame of a system is to introduce inanity and to invite stultification. His method is one of repeated and recurring explication of an intuition of being, and this very procedure is one of the distinctions of his thought. Both philo- sophic and scientific speculation, he felt, must be free to attack problems individually, to understand each as a unique thing-in- itself. It should not be altogether surprising, therefore, that a half-century of thought should yield a refinement of his initial in- tuition which a "system" oriented critic could easily point out as a formal inconsistency. This much must be said by way of extenuation. But precisely because Bergson himself has chosen to be silent and inexplicit with respect to the fundamental ambiguity of his last work, the problem must be explicitly set forth here. Myth, Bergson has told us, is a contrivance of the infra-rational fabulatory function of human nature. It is an intellectually false representation which conveys an essential truth of life's necessity. This truth has been intuited by man's social instinct, and the sum total of these intuited truths so restricts the range of human action as to insure the well-being of society. These myths are the natural means by which deluded intellect is kept from pushing too far its real knowledge. Myths of a given society both establish and enforce that particular society's morality. This much lies within the scope of the original Bergsonian conception. But a source of morality strictly beyond the notion of life and nature is introduced in the conception of dynamic religion. And with this conception comes a new theory of human is The Reverend Henry Hogarth, "Bergson's Spiritual Pilgrimage," Hibbert Journal, Vol. LI (October 1952), pp. 63-66.</page><page sequence="25">BERGSON ON MYTH AND SOCIETY 195 nature. Dynamic religion is the achievement of a supreme effort of man himself. This effort is necessitated by what Bergson fancies to be an error of nature. Intellect has exceeded the bounds set for it by nature and has jeopardized social order in so doing. This unexpected crisis is met by man through the supra- natural morality of aspiration to Divinity. The specific source of this new morality is mystical experience of transcendent Deity. Insofar as this experience may even be described, it is the indi- vidual soul of the mystic opening itself to Divinity and receiving from Divinity the gracious response of universal and ineffable Love. This is the second of the "two sources of morality and religion." It is morality founded in the love of a gracious God. Through a reciprocity of love and participation in love, the Brotherhood of man on earth becomes historically real. The most telling criticism to be made of Bergson for the formal difficulties here outlined follows from Occam's Rule of Parsimony. Even in the face of a proof and the repeated assertion of the im- mutability of human nature, Bergson falls victim of a progressivist fallacy which he consistently derides. He has man raise himself from natural man to mystic and, by so doing, create a new species. Two essentially different theories of the nature of man are, thereby, postulated when a single theory of greater generality would have been sufficient to account for the experiential sources of both instinctive and mystical morality. The roots of this in- consistency lie in Bergson's persistent biologism. In considering life as the essence of being, Bergson fixed upon a facet of being insufficient to account for the profundity of human experience. In metaphysical terms, this criticism may be phrased in the follow- ing language: Bergson mistook pure being as endless becoming (the elan vital). A further aspect of this fundamental difficulty can be seen in the equation of the elan vital with the God of the Christian mystics. The former is initially characterized as a finite impetus that has sustained innumerable stops in its movement through refractory matter. Yet the exuberant mystical experience of</page><page sequence="26">196 SOCIAL RESEARCH ineffable Deity is explained in terms of man's renewed attachment to the elan vital. By this explanation, ineffable Deity becomes a creator of restriction and potency. The Holy Father of the Christ of the Gospels, and the God of the great mystics is identified with the finite force immanent to nature. The difference of "vital tone" observed between instinctive and mystic morality is thereby made inexplicable. But this mode of criticism is best abandoned at this point, after it has served the purpose of identifying the configuration of the formal problem. It is true enough that Bergson has obscured and made ambiguous his philosophic achievement by his per- sistent biologism. But we must be reminded of two facts. First, it is a mistake to treat Bergson's philosophical inquiry (a zetema in the Socratic sense) as though it were a mere problem in ele- mentary logic. The rationale of Bergson's work lies, not at the level of the formulae per se, but at the level of the unfolding of the experiences symbolized in these signs. The conceptual grasp extends and deepens as the experiences differentiate. The move- ment is an oscillatory or spiral one in which the central concepts undergo repeated explication and redefinition. Bergson himself has likened the process to the composition of "a Beethoven symphony" (note 4, p. 241). A general parallel might be drawn with the progress of the zetema of the Republic and its attendant series of definitions and redefinitions of Dike. Bergson's elan vital can be equated with God because the Life of which it is the core has begun, in Bergson's thought, as the biological force ani- mating nature and the evolution process but has ended as the Life of "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life" and as the Love that is quintessential to the God Who is Love (note 4, p. 240). The conception of intuition has a similar amplitude: 1) it is the virtual instinct surrounding the intellect whose insights into the necessities of existence become the stuff of myth; 2) it is the intro- spective way of knowing which is productive of metaphysical knowledge, the vital impetus itself having been discovered by this means; and 3) it is the introversion of the mystic whose end is</page><page sequence="27">BERGSON ON MYTH AND SOCIETY 197 "a participation in the divine essence" (note 4, p. 252). The funda- mental experience of real duration (duree reelle) with which Bergson began, moves from the realization of the "continuity of our inner life" through the mystic intuition "to the roots of our being, and thus to the very principle of life in general" (note 4, p. 238). The intuition of the consubstantiality of life, attested by myth, metaphysics, and mysticism, leads to the question which Bergson leaves unresolved: "Can the after-life, which is apparently assured to our soul ... be identical with that of the life into which, even here below, certain privileged souls insert themselves?" (note 4, pp. 252 ff.). The second fact of which we must be reminded is that Bergson pointedly admits going beyond his earlier thought in the work before us. "No doubt we are here going beyond the conclusions we reached in Creative Evolution. We wanted then to keep as close as pos- sible to facts. . . . Here we are in the field of probabilities alone. But we cannot reiterate too often that philosophic certainty admits of degrees, that it calls for intuition as well as for reason, and that if intuition, backed by science, is to be extended, such extension can be made only by mystical intuition. In fact, the conclusions just set out complete naturally, though not necessarily, those of our former work (note 4, pp. 244 ff.). What remains disconcerting about Bergson's exposition in the later work is the use of a terminology saturated with biological connotation. He does not undertake to draw any distinction between life immanent and life transcendent. His discussion of the mystics' experiences of trans- cendence is both beautiful and brilliant, but it is deficient in form and definition. Even though there is the expansion of the meaning of intuition until its amplitude encompasses faith,1* the account of this mystical intuition remains unduly subjective and the analysis remains preoccupied with process considered as im- manent to the world of nature. Creative evolution, as this process 14 Cf. John MacWilliam, Criticism of the Philosophy of Bergson (Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1928), pp. 263 ff.</page><page sequence="28">198 SOCIAL RESEARCH is called, remains to the very end the center of Bergson's thought. History and revelation are compressed (note 4, p. 241) into func- tions of the natural process. This natural process then is ex- panded and extended, in the closing lines of the Two Sources, so that cosmogony at last is seen through the veil of mystic intui- tion as essentially theogony: the universe is a machine whose "essential function" is "the making of gods" (note 4, p. 306). Bergson's meditation thus ends in the apotheosis of mankind. This telos is to be attained through the intentional striving of men who understand the urgency of the problem and that the future lies in theirs own hands. Whatever the prospects of sur- vival in eternity and beatitude in the beyond (and a new psychic science might, someday, make us "absolutely sure" of these), "an ever-spreading mystic intuition" can diffuse transcendent joy "throughout the world" when men have become, thereby, trans- figured into gods (cf., note 4, p. 280). Bergson's "dynamic re- ligion," seen in this context, would appear to be a kind of mystical Christianity vitiated at its center by an immanentist hypostasis of the eschaton; this theoretical fallacy is basically gnostic and characteristic of all ideology.15 Dynamic religion has its counter- part in the "open society"; and the open society is modern (as distinguished from ancient) democracy. "Of all political systems, it is indeed the furthest removed from nature, the only one to trans- cend, at least in intention, the conditions of the 'closed society* " (note 4, p. 270). The citizen in a democracy is assumed to be the perfect man, the "ideal man." "It [democracy] proclaims liberty, demands equality, and recon- ciles these two hostile sisters by reminding them that they are sisters, by exalting above everything fraternity ... the essential thing is fraternity: . . . democracy is evangelical in essence . . . its motive power is love" (note 4, pp. 270 ff.). Exemplifying what is For a general discussion of this fallacious construction see Eric Voegelin, New Science of Politics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1952), pp. 119ff. and passim. Voegelin does not appear to regard Bergson as guilty of this fallacy. See, however, p. 158.</page><page sequence="29">BERGSON ON MYTH AND SOCIETY 199 is designated as the "law of dichotomy" (note 4, p. 285), mysticism and the mechanization which led to the Industrial Revolution and, so, modern mass society, are integrally related as the mere splitting up of the same tendency: ". . . the mystical summons up the mechanical (note 4, p. 298; cf. p. 299). Mechanization and democracy were born together (note 4, p. 296). Bergson's dynamic religion becomes the doctrine of democratic society as he con- ceives it; and, in the later pages of the Two Sources, one comes strongly to suspect that the author is not so much engaged in theoretical analysis as in the contrivance of a myth or the matrix of a myth of the future open society. He admits to dealing here only with "possibilities or probabilities" and remarks that this is the case because of the central fact of freedom in human ex- istence: "the future of humanity remains indeterminate, precisely because it is on humanity that it depends" (note 4, p. 288). Berg- son appears to move to interpose his own intuition of being in a quasi-mythic configuration as a hedge against a faulty response by mankind. He begins one paragraph in this section with the sentence: "Let a mystic genius but appear, he will draw after him a humanity already vastly grown in body, and whose soul he has transfigured" (note 4, p. 300). While we cannot here go much beyond hints, it would appear that at least part of Bergson's con- cern in his last work is the contrivance of a scientistic myth capable of persuading men in the Age of Science of the validity of certain spiritual truths. We must, lastly, raise the question: Has Bergson's vitalism derailed into pantheism in his last work? We do not find that this question can be given a conclusive answer. Bergson himself has been quoted as having said: "Pantheism never appealed to me" (quoted in note 13, p. 66). This sentence, in its context, purports to reject the idea that union with God entails absorption into Him. Also, at least traces of the idea of Personality are to be found in Bergson (note 4, p. 241). But he defines the "ultimate end" of mysticism as "the establishment of a contact, consequently of a partial coincidence, with the creative effort which life itself</page><page sequence="30">200 SOCIAL RESEARCH manifests . . . thus continuing and extending the divine action. "This effort is of God, if it is not God himself" (note 4, p. 209). From this initial formulation he moves, forty pages later, to further define mysticism as "a participation in the divine essence" (note 4, p. 252). True, Bergson leavens his optimism with caution. For example, he writes: "Mysticism is undoubtedly at the origin of great moral transformations. And mankind* seems to be as far away as ever from it." "For we must remember that 'static religion' is natural to man, and that nature does not alter." Yet he follows the first quotation with the suspensive query: "But who knows?" (note 4, p. 280, 300). And this suspension signals the hesitation which faith and hope overcome in Bergson's final vision of the future. Their characteristic "dimorphism" (note 4, p. 267) can permit men to lead, and be led, either by the mystic hero or by a new science of the "unconscious" (note 4, p. 303) into an inconceivably transformed future peopled by gods or supermen.16 Bergson's faith, however, lies in man's ability to excavate salvation by mining the El Dorado of the unconscious; it is this shaft that leads man to his renewed return to the vital impetus-essence of divinity. This arduous way out of the crisis of the present reduces the tension of existence until it vanishes in the identity of the future man-god. The tendency toward pantheism is, of course, evident through- out Bergson's work and derives from his early vitalism as modified by the mystical theory of Immanence. We are not so much in- terested in evidence to the effect that he, personally, may have successfully resisted pantheism. (As suggested in note 13.) 17 What is of interest, and it is precisely that which is not so clear, is whether his philosophy of history has escaped. As one penetrating student of the general problem has written, "Unless safeguarded is Cf. p. 301 for "limitless" and p. 304 for the terra incognita. See Arnold J.

We feel obliged to interpolate that to speak of a "deliberately contrived myth" is not to utter a contradiction in terms, despite what some of our contemporaries seem to believe.19 For the most consummate master of the philosophy of the myth, Plato, was also equally the master of its artistic contrivance.

As Jan Huizinga has said, "In all the wild imaginings of mythology a fanciful spirit is playing on the borderline between jest and earnest." 20 Bergson conveys this insight by ascribing to a fabulatory function the production of systematically false experiences. It is, however, to be remarked that, if Bergson errs in his conception of myth it is, indeed, pre- cisely because he exaggerates this play element beyond proper bounds through his over emphasis of myth's intentionality and man's intellectuality; he would thereby become a victim of what Eric Voegelin has called the "anthropomorphic fallacy." 21 It is, finally, to be said that, by moving to conclude his master- work by articulating his own intuition of human destiny, the employment of the myth became ineluctable for Bergson. That he was aware of this is clear now from his repeated insistence that the passage was, in terms of an epistemology of science, only one of probabilities. He thus evidently sought to rank his myth at the same "truth" level that Plato has apparently placed the eikds mythos (likely story) of the Timaeus.22 This discovery eclipses our concern with the question of pantheism in Bergson and makes it not only unanswerable, but irrelevant as well. The urgent question now becomes: What is the significance of Bergson's Theogonic Myth? 20 Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-Element in Culture (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1949), pp. 4-5; cf. pp. 136 ff. 21 Voegelin defines the "anthropomorphic fallacy" as "forming man in the image of conscious man."
