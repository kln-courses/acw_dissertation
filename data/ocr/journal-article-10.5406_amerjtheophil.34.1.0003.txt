<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Corrington’s Ecstatic Naturalism   in Light of the Scientific Study of Religion Wesley J. Wildman / boston university    and the institute for the    bio-cultural study of religion I. Introduction robert s. corrington has misgivings about the use of the word “natu-ralism” to describe his view of reality; in fact, more recently he has been using “deep pantheism” and variants.1 nevertheless, “naturalism”  remains an apt word, conjuring the creative depths of the world around us, and  we should continue to use it to describe corrington’s philosophical-theological  system—without unduly apologizing for its inevitably circular semantic con- tent, and despite the risk that his view might be known by its name instead of  its content. The variant of naturalism for which corrington is so well known  is called (by him) ecstatic naturalism, and he has shown it to be an important  version of religiously and axiologically nonreductive naturalism.2  corrington’s view deserves careful analysis and evaluation in light of many  fields, including the scientific study of religion, with which it has not been in  extensive dialogue to this point. While the scientific study of religion does not  have the final say on religion or psychology or metaphysics, it has proved to be  a fertile conversation partner for all manner of interpretations of religiously  relevant themes, and it is an intriguing exercise to assess corrington’s ecstatic  naturalism through its lens. in conversation with the scientific study of religion, ecstatic naturalism looks  impressively robust in many respects, particularly regarding • its view of ultimacy (the evidence appears to demand nothing more than  what ecstatic naturalism supplies); 1. see robert s. corrington, “deep Pantheism,” Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature  and Culture 1, no. 4 (2007): 503–7. 2. This view is developed in a series of books, especially robert s. corrington, Nature and  Spirit: An Essay in Ecstatic Naturalism (new york: fordham university Press, 1992); Ecstatic  Naturalism: Signs of the World (bloomington: indiana university Press, 1994); Nature’s Self:  Our Journey from Origin to Spirit (lanham, md: rowman &amp; littlefield Publishers, 1996);  Nature’s Religion (lanham, md: rowman &amp; littlefield Publishers, 1997); and A Semiotic  Theory of Theology and Philosophy (cambridge: cambridge university Press, 2000).

The social construction of reality as well as the analysis of religious and spiritual  experiences urge recognition that our experiences of the axiological potentials of  nature are mediated not only by the projective fields springing from the human  underconscious (which corrington analyzes beautifully) but also by the social  embedding of each human person in habits of living and seeing that constitute  the axiological potentials of nature in culturally distinctive ways.  An important question for those who appreciate ecstatic naturalism in cor- rington’s or any other form is whether the analysis of sacred folds, intervals,  and their unruly ground can be framed so as to comport better with findings  from the scientific study of religion without sacrificing axiological realism and  without losing the existential vibrancy and psychological potency that has  made ecstatic naturalism so beloved as a way of interpreting reality. That is  the subject of this essay. n. scott momaday is one of  the great contemporary American writers, a   Kiowa-cherokee who won the Pulitzer Prize for his breakthrough 1968 novel  House Made of Dawn.3 in Ken burn’s majestic documentary The West, mo- maday describes the American West in the following intriguing terms: “To the  native American, it’s full of sacred realities, powerful things. it’s a landscape  that has to be seen to be believed. And i say on occasion it may have to be  believed in order to be seen.”4 The second half  of  this provocative maxim,  i believe, receives insufficient attention in corrington’s ecstatic naturalism.  corrington describes the encounter with nature and its impact on our beliefs  3. n. scott momaday, House Made of Dawn (new york: harper &amp; row, 1968). 4. “The West” (1966), directed by stephen ives, with Ken burns as executive producer.

This is an axiological variety of critical realism. emphasizing  one side of this collaboration at the expense of the other inevitably leads to a  reductionistic and ultimately misleading account of sacred nature.  i will argue that corrington’s ecstatic naturalism favors one side of this collab- orative hermeneutical venture at the expense of the other, thereby underplaying  the social construction of reality, overemphasizing the self-interpreting quality  of natural complexes, and positing greater structuralist consistency in human  experience of the natural world than is actually present. i argue that the proxi- mate sources of this one-sidedness of interpretation are an allergy to the influ- ence on modern thought of immanuel Kant’s categories of the understanding  and an overreaction to the tireless and seemingly timeless tendency of religious  interpreters to mistake their longings toward ultimacy for the thing itself. i fur- ther argue that the ultimate sources of this one-sidedness of interpretation are  diagnosable and correctable by paying attention to the findings of the scientific  study of religion, particularly in the form of the social construction of reality. II. Ecstatic Naturalism: Folds, Intervals, Ground Just about the most succinct statement i have read of corrington’s ecstatic natu- ralism is included in the introductory material for the first Annual congress  on ecstatic naturalism:5 “An ecstatic naturalism is a perspective that seeks to  move toward an aesthetic phenomenology of nature’s ‘sacred folds’—special  centers of numinous meaning and power that may be found throughout nature.  . . . from nature’s sacred folds emerges a fierce self-othering, nature naturing,  where ‘it’ moves ecstatically ejecting semiotically dense momenta. nature natur- ing is the inexhaustible well of nature’s atemporal creating underconscious.”  There is something magnificent about corrington’s prose when he is describ- ing nature naturing as manifest in sacred folds. he recklessly plunders other  realms of experience to cobble together a poetics of indirection that coheres and  5.

We find in this description, and throughout corrington’s writings, a realist  depiction of the objectivity of the inexhaustible creativity of nature naturing  as it ejects semiotically dense momenta into and through sacred folds. cor- rington’s various descriptions of these ejects and our role in their reception is  phenomenologically sound. They are indeed semiotically dense, beyond the  threshold of ready intelligibility, and thus they shatter into perspectival shards  upon reception, their semiotically impossibly dense momenta amplified by  the projective fields that mark the interaction between unconscious-conscious  dynamics of every human life and their analogues in the creative chasm divid- ing the unruly fecundity of nature naturing and the manifest orders of nature  natured. This is just right as a description of the most intense forms of the  human encounter with ultimacy. Any apophatically inclined philosophical  theologian rejoices to have such flexible and robust conceptual resources at  his or her imaginative fingertips. i doubt there has ever been a psychodynami- cally more intuitive reading of the way projective fields intensify and distort  the human reception of semiotic density in the sacred fold. sigmund freud’s  The Future of an Illusion seems simplistic by comparison.6 unlike a host of  philosophical theologians before him, corrington refuses to oversimplify or  understate the power of  projective longing in interpretations of  sacred en- counters. in this respect, corrington is an impeccable student of the scientific  study of religion: he makes the most of the lessons he learned at the feet of the  great analysts of the human underconscious and its unstable yet potent ejects  into conscious feeling and understanding. even Paul Tillich, who shared these  same intuitions, never achieved anything remotely approaching corrington’s  depth and subtlety when striving to describe these processes. in fact, Tillich’s  efforts to develop a theology of nature in the third volume of his Systematic  Theology are little more than shy gestures by comparison.7 6. sigmund freud, The Future of an Illusion, The international Psycho-Analytical library,  no. 15 (new york: h. liveright, 1928). 7.

A careful reader of  corrington  gets the sense that he gets jittery reading a lot of  philosophical theology,  annoyed at the careless handling of  human projective longing as it happily  distorts the nature of  nature, first taming it, then making it useful for the  projects of  social life and civilization building, and finally customizing it  for the avoidance of  cognitive dissonance—an energy-saving protocol that  all civilization-building projects demand. This brutal twisting of  the truth  offends his ecstatic naturalist piety. first it trivializes the momentous by  “theorizing evil” and by pretending, with fairy-tale innocence, that there is  no chasm between the unruly ground and the orders of  nature that it ejects.  Then it invests great moment in the trivial through misjudging the presence  of  pattern in natural processes in preparation for succumbing to the greatest  of  all human pretenses, supposing with delirious, delicious confidence that  there is rational and moral purpose behind it all. We picture corrington, now  thoroughly nauseated by the repetition of  the same suite of  careless errors,  about to collapse onto the couch, there to refresh himself  with aromatherapy  while swearing off  philosophical theology forever. And then along comes a  benedict spinoza, a friedrich schelling, an Arthur schopenhauer, or one  of  a tiny handful of  other thinkers. At last we sense corrington’s restless- ness yield to relaxation. These saints of  the phenomenology of  the unruly  ground feel what he feels, complain the way he complains, and like him fight  in vain against the tsunamis of  human delusion. he knows he is not alone  8.

This resoluteness in the face of  the tragically deluded confidence of  the  brightly lit topside of all theological traditions bespeaks courage, in one re- spect, but perhaps also a kind of resentful outrage—an outrage possessing an  energy that only violated piety can ever really muster. one senses this ressenti- ment lurking when corrington tries to explain schelling’s and schopenhauer’s  imperfections by blaming them on Kant’s influence.  supposedly, the pervasive defect of both thinkers lies in their ensnarement in  the Kantian epistemological framework, a perspective that has done as much  damage to the aspirations of a healthy naturalism as any in the tradition. our  contemporary neo-Kantianism, which privileges the manipulative over the as- similative aspect of semiosis, has put nature into eclipse and has been one of  the primary mechanisms by which the postmodern narcissistic self has protected  itself against genuine (rather than paper) otherness. insofar as grounds remain  viable for the neo-Kantian self, they are self-legislated categorical projections  that give the self the illusion that it rests on something other than desire.10  There is considerable wisdom in this analysis of Kant’s influence. Kant’s cat- egories of the understanding; his view of the imagination; and his relegation  of god, freedom, and immortality to regulative ideas or postulates of moral  reasoning do indeed deflate nature’s potent ejects in the name of epistemologi- cal  modesty—one senses that the phrase of leron shults, “epistemic prudery,”  would be equally apt.11 one of Kant’s impacts was certainly to magnify the con- stitutive (corrington calls it manipulative!) element of interpretation, at the ex- pense of the receptive (corrington calls it assimilative) element. And ontological  grounds for Kant are indeed categorical projections or rational postulates justified  by their supposed necessity for making sense of human reason and experience.  What a dressing down Kant gave to nature, in his attempt properly to establish  metaphysics! And how tidy and properly Königsburg-like the result! This is a  far cry from the unruly ground whose semiotic ejects are unfathomably present  in sacred folds, filling us with manic energy, flooding us with surplus meaning,  spawning exquisite entanglements of joy and despair, and serving up gloriously  chaotic semiotic momenta for eager selection, fragmentation, magnification, and  consumption in the projective fields we bring to their reception. 10. corrington, Nature’s Religion, 98. 11. f. leron shults, “science and religious supremacy: Toward a naturalist Theology of  religions,” in Science and the World’s Religions, vol. 3, Religions and Controversies, ed.

The Unruly Ground in Comparative Perspective if  one allows oneself  to be thoroughly seduced by corrington’s depiction of  the unruly ground that spontaneously ejects the orders of nature along with  their delicious disruptions—and i have tried—Kant’s metaphysics comes to  seem oddly and perversely austere. even robert neville’s creation ex nihilo  metaphysics, with its crazy yahweh theism conjoined to its thoroughly atheistic  realism about there being no determinate contrast to being, can seem weirdly  serene by contrast to corrington’s vision.12 let’s dwell on this contrast for a  moment, allowing ourselves to be momentarily (but fruitfully) distracted from  the main flow of argument in this paper.  imagine the great gallery of metaphysical fantasies. standing before neville’s  contribution, which hangs there on the wall, we are confronted with the artistic  portrayal of an eternal creative act-without-an-agent that yields both a deter- minate created reality and a creator god as ontological ground of that reality.  We are intrigued by the idea that there cannot be a god apart from everything  determinate, so we are deeply impressed by how fundamental is the solution  to the problem of the one and the many that neville depicts with his eternal  creative act. A more fundamental solution is, in fact, logically impossible. We  are captivated by how rational this vision of reality is: not rational in the sense  of springing from a divine mind but rational in the all-important sense of all  parts of reality being seeable together in one theoretic vision. We are amazed at  the fact that such a view can be rendered consistent with any other alternative  view of ultimate reality, so long as that which is made determinate in the eter- nal creative act is precisely what the alternative view postulates. Whiteheadian  cosmoi, pratītya-samutpāda visions, and even supernatural personal theism are  all consistent elaborations of neville’s ex nihilo framework. in due course this  vision of multiple compatibility drives us to wonder what we get from the idea  of an eternal creative act-without-an-agent that makes any difference to life as  we live it. so long as we confine ourselves to this creation ex nihilo aspect of  neville’s metaphysics, the ex nihilo framework eventually takes aesthetic shape  as the perfectly neutral host, infinitely polite toward many less expansive and  more robustly opinionated metaphysical visions, and telling us nothing about  nature as such, nor about god as such. everything remains to be said. neville  himself, of course, goes on to say many things, elaborating his own specific ver- sion of the god-world relation consistently with his ex nihilo framework, but  these subsequent moves require premises not present in the ex nihilo metaphysics  12. see robert cummings neville, God the Creator: On the Transcendence and Presence of  God (chicago: chicago university Press, 1968).

What an amazing accomplishment! how serenely indifferent to the mighty  struggles of less general and more colorful metaphysical visions! how effortlessly  it assimilates, borg-like, every alternative metaphysical account into its view of  the god-world relation! how perfectly jewel-like, eternally pristine!  blissfully elated, and yet oddly far from sated, we feel an aesthetic tug for  something more debased. We turn to our right and behold a mural wall full  of the most violently vibrant images depicting one possible way in which real- ity might in fact be determined in neville’s eternal creative act. it is not what  neville predicts, but his creation ex nihilo theory by itself can’t rule it out, either.  here we see corrington’s picture of nature naturing ejecting into and through  nature’s sacred folds, yielding the orders of nature in conflicted, semirational,  and sometimes obsequiously well-organized ways. This is reality significantly  unscaled to human interests and yet incorrigibly seducing one after another  of us through appeal to our projective longings—all this before deconstruct- ing every moment of manic empowerment with the relentless juxtaposition of  alternative semiotic trajectories. The mural tries to conjure the chasm demanded  by these experiences under the tsunamic onslaught of  semiotic density: the  chasm between nature naturing, which never hides and yet is never available for  rational assimilation, and nature natured, which testifies in its manifold orders  and disruptions to its character as always and only ejected from an unruly  ground. We know neville’s jewel lies just in the periphery of our vision, and  yet we can’t tear our eyes away from corrington’s magnificent depiction of the  chaotic underconscious of nature pressing into joyful, abysmal manifestation. This, i believe, is one of the very few times we can have our metaphysical cake  and eat it too. neville’s creation ex nihilo—considered apart from his supposed  empirically driven account of the god-world relation in detail—is the cake we  keep (eternally, as it were). corrington’s abyss of incomprehensibility simultane- ously dividing nature naturing from nature natured while mediating the two by  means of untamable ejects is the cake we eat. At the end of his extraordinary  foreword to corrington’s Nature’s Religion, neville crystallizes his disagreement  in a poignant way: “can we give thanks to the ground for the brief life of a  dead child? corrington says no and i say yes.”13 but corrington does not say no.  his depiction of nature’s grace and cosmic jouissance opens the possibility of  offering heart-felt thanks to the unruly ground for the brief life of a dead child.  And neville’s “yes” derives from another phase of his metaphysics, whereas his  ex nihilo doctrine, considered by itself, cannot settle the question either way, yes  or no. so even at this point where clean contradiction is promised, it really does  not eventuate under scrutiny. There are other cakes to eat, and perhaps there  13. robert neville, foreword to corrington, Nature’s Religion, xv.

IV. The Scientific Study of Religion and Metaphysics returning to the main line of this essay’s argument . . . corrington has an am- bivalent relation to the wealth of literature on the scientific study of religion,  especially as it affects religion and metaphysics.  on the one hand, he thoroughly absorbs and even extends the idea of pro- jection, gifting us with the idea of a projective field through which we engage,  amplify, and become ecstatically overwhelmed by semiotic momenta arcing  through and from sacred folds. no philosophical theologian has ever presented  a richer or more honest appraisal of human longing and its opportunities and  distortions. corrington also seems alert to our tendency to hyperactive agency  detection, which has become so important in recent theories of the origins of  religion, and especially of the origins of belief  in supernatural agents. he does  not name it in these terms, but he instinctively recognizes our tendency to see  patterns where there are none and to attribute intentional agency where none  exists. indeed, he makes hearty use of this insight to explain the human insa- tiability for gods and god. in these respects, corrington seems highly attuned  to what has emerged in the last century or so about cognitive biases in human  beings; would that this were true of more theologians.  on the other hand, corrington seems less well versed in, or perhaps less  convinced by, other domains of the scientific study of religion. i have space to  discuss just one of these, and i choose the social construction of reality because it  goes to the heart of my concern about his metaphysics. from Émile durkheim14  through Peter berger15 to poststructuralism and beyond,16 there has been ad- duced powerful evidence that human beings create a social reality in such a  way that it (1) orients individuals to their identity and obligations, (2) operates  smoothly when its artificial character is not recognized, (3) cosmologizes itself   14.

This social construction of reality is not completely  relativistic; it can accept that there might be structural commonalities across  cultures and even universal features of human cognition and culture—indeed,  the social construction of reality itself  is one such universal. Thus, the social  construction of reality when properly developed need not be liable to the cri- tique corrington leveled against Kant, which i quoted above; it can still be a  realistic approach to nature’s power and need not reduce nature’s ground to a  mere rational postulate. despite this promise of congeniality to robust realism  in accounts of nature and its ground—virtues that corrington clearly prizes— corrington does not give the social construction of reality its due.  corrington is not alone in this. most theologians neglect the social con- struction of reality, to the point that many social scientists shun theology as  belligerently self-deceptive discourse, or worse, discourse that knowingly ma- nipulates religious communities. At least corrington can never be accused of  that! but in one vital way, corrington’s thought embodies a persistent refusal to  acknowledge the central claims of the social construction of reality, and does  so without an effective argument to justify the move made. This unjustified  resistance to the social construction of reality is supported by a risky bet on  phenomenology’s capacity to tell us what nature is—in itself and to a significant  degree apart from any construal of it that arises through the projective fields  by which we engage it.  so where is the problem? in a nutshell, the problem is that corrington knows  too much about where and when sacred folds are and allows too little for the  way that human beings participate in constituting them as sacred and as folds.  he locates the superfluity of  signification in sacred folds, regarding them as  nature naturing’s ejects, springing forth from the unruly ground. They are  where they are in time and space and not elsewhere. nature naturing spews  its creative testimony to creativity whether we notice it or not, indeed whether  we exist or not. corrington takes with great seriousness the imaginative and  creative ways by which human beings receive the manifestations of  power in  ecstasy, magnified and distorted by projective fields. but he says almost nothing  about the sacred folds we build—and this is the all-important insight of  the  social construction of reality. We constitute the sacred; we don’t just discover  it. We create venues for ecstasy; we are not just grasped by ecstatic power from  out of  the blue. Whether we create them or we stumble across them—and it is  probably both at once in most cases—we encounter with thankfulness these  awesome manifestations of  nature’s depths, with perspectivally fractured tes- AJTP 34_1 text.indd   12 1/11/13   2:36 PM </page> <page sequence="11">  Volume 34, no. 1, January 2013 13 timony, and with superfluity of  meaning channeled through the structures of  our own underconscious, as those dark structures limn the interstitial spaces  of  the underconscious of  nature itself.  can corrington really be right, despite the power of the explanatory frame- work deriving from the social construction of  reality? Within the tradition  of ecstatic naturalists, there has been a slightly reticent subtradition of her- meneutically locating our contribution to intense experiences wholly on the  side of reception, and not at all on the side of constituting these moments of  revelation. This anti-Kantian gesture toward real nature with real Values  beyond our manipulation is understandable, particularly after the extension  of the phenomenological method from its origins in tracing meanings in hu- man experience to interpreting axiological structures in nature more generally.  for example, Paul Tillich, who deserves to be honored as an ecstatic naturalist  despite his own naming preferences, places most of the weight of human con- structive imagination on the subjective “receptive” side of revelation, leaving  what he called the objective “miracle” side wholly to god and marginalizing  the constitutive role of human beings in creating such miracles. This served to  suggest that Tillich’s god was always the primary agent of revelation, which  Tillich required in order to make sense of the new being as something histori- cally realized rather than merely a regulative ideal for human spiritual quests.  This conviction seemed to be weakening toward the end of  his life, due to  greater exposure to the world religions and sincere absorption of their wisdom,  and Tillich regretted not having time and energy to reconstruct his theology in  accordance with his emerging viewpoint.  This precedent is helpful for understanding corrington’s way of elaborat- ing axiological realism about nature, but he approaches the issue differently.  corrington has no interest in preserving the residual traces of telic personality  that remained in Tillich’s thought after his incomplete purging of them in the  name of a ground-of-being theology. Thus corrington does not have Tillich’s  reason for thoroughly marginalizing the constitutive role of human beings in the  collaborative creation of sacred folds. but corrington still performs the same  heroic feat as Tillich, for different reasons. Perhaps it is an overreaction against  Kant’s privileging of “the manipulative over the assimilative aspect of semiosis”  or an overly hopeful appraisal of the powers of phenomenology to tell us what  nature is in itself, without tainting from our projective fields. my bet is that this  all-important preference in corrington’s version of axiological realism derives  from his own experience of nature. i say this mostly because my preference for a  more balanced approach also derives from my experiences. i prefer to distribute  the effects of human creativity evenly on the constitutive and receptive sides of  AJTP 34_1 text.indd   13 1/11/13   2:36 PM </page> <page sequence="12"> 14 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy the scale, thereby honoring both the analytical psychology of the vast wellsprings  of the human underconscious and the formidable intellectual accomplishment of  self-realization that we call the social construction of reality. And i want to do  this while remaining a realist about variations in axiological intensity in nature. V. Evidence for an Alternative View? how can i be confident that corrington is one-sided in the way he interprets  the disposition of  human creativity in our engagement with the axiological  depth structures and flows of enveloping nature? it is not just because of the  marginalization of one or another aspect of the scientific study of religion—in  this case the social construction of reality—but also because i think careful  phenomenological work does not bear out his account of  the determinate  geography of sacred folds as well as it does the encounter with the sacred fold  itself. i shall pursue this briefly.  in preparation for writing this essay, i performed an informal experiment in  axiological depth perception, on myself, and aimed at testing the validity of  corrington’s phenomenology of sacred folds. i wanted particularly to evalu- ate the pattern in the examples he considers, whereby each example has the  quality of a sacred place encountered or a sacred moment confronted—rather  than human creations of sacred depth.  This experiment involved trying with all the openness i possess, and with  thorough spiritual and intellectual preparation, to be ecstatically overwhelmed  by semiotic density in a famous sacred fold that still functions as such for some  people. Thanks to some priceless connections, i was honored to be the guest  of two leading figures in traditional hawai’ian religion as it is still practiced on  the less developed northwest side of the island of o’ahu. Almost completely  obliterated by the rise of  christianity among native hawai’ians, traditional  hawai’ian religion is, roughly speaking, polytheistic shamanistic nature reli- gion in which traditional knowledge of plants and animals is passed down the  generations, along with rituals and stories that explain human life and situate  it safely and harmoniously in relation to its proximate and ultimate contexts. i  spent hours with one of these men, driving up and down the coast, frequently  stopping to walk to a sacred site, listening to the associated story, and some- times participating in a prayer or some other act of deference and devotion. i  spent another hour with the main priest and shaman of a heiau (temple) who,  having carefully prepared the spirits for our arrival so that we would not be  harmed by being in that sacred place, walked us around the centuries-old site  and explained the meanings, practices, protocols, and metaphysical underpin- nings of their view of the world.

The shaman-priest explained how the site of the temple would have  been instantly recognized as sacred and the ideal site for the construction of a  lava-rock heiau for the agricultural deity lono: the valley structure, the creek to  the left, the poised rock to the right, the steep mountains behind, the variety of  trees. i could train myself in these habits of recognition, but i was also struck  at how culturally inculcated the intuitions were. i saw other heiaus, no longer in  use (christians are definitely winning the battle for the heart and soul of native  hawai’ians) and memorialized only by the national Park service or rendered  almost invisible by tall grasses and neglect. They were located using a different set  of culturally conditioned axiological intuitions—high up above the sea affording  fabulous vistas, or actually in the shallows of the water—different intuitions for  different deities. similarly, the caves and ridges, the rock-worn slippery slides on  the edges of mountains and the blow holes to which they lead—each had special  meaning because of a story. i drank in the stories, i was deeply moved by the  plight of those for whom this dying religion is a tragedy, and i felt a powerful con- nection to new friends. but i was not overwhelmed by semiotic momenta because  i was not culturally prepared from birth to construe the axiological structures  in this way. other people were so prepared: i saw offerings at the heiau. i also  listened to the priest’s explanations of what was ritually proper and improper  about the way the offerings were made and the corresponding spiritual benefits  and dangers. i thought i saw the decline of the requisite axiological sensitivi- ties even in the frequency with which the priest had to intervene to correct an  improperly offered gift.  At one point while walking around the heiau, i described to my guides the  meaning of a sacred fold, as this is spoken about “in my business,” thinking  of mircea eliade, corrington, and others. in conclusion i likened the sacred  fold to a whale breeching the surface of the ocean and thereby momentarily  manifesting invisible flows of power beyond the reach of ordinary perception.  They seemed moved at this exhibition of empathy for their way of seeing the  world, and one of them returned several times to the image i had offered in  an attempt to explain the sense in which some special place was sacred to him  and to those of his people who still know how to see like he sees. but i was not  experiencing their special places as sacred folds. i wanted to, and i understood  how they did, but i could not.  by the same token, i sincerely doubt that places sacred to me would have  been so for my new friends. i think of the plunging arc of the Vietnam War  AJTP 34_1 text.indd   15 1/11/13   2:36 PM </page> <page sequence="14"> 16 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy memorial on the mall in Washington dc, the incomparable tragic beauty  of Taj mahal, or the barrenness of the birkenau death camp in Poland—all  human creations, each utterly overwhelming me with semiotic intensity by  virtue of place, history, geometry, and scale, all intensified and also muddled  and fractured by the projective field i brought with me to those places. This  intensity was every bit the equal of seeing the grand canyon from below, flying  around the interior of the similarly majestic Waimea canyon on the garden  island of Kawai’i, or seeing the edge of  my home continent at last arriving  over the horizon after a long flight across the Pacific ocean. VI. Conclusion for both phenomenological and philosophical reasons, then, i conclude that  we constitute the sacred in our environment in just the way that the social  construction of reality describes, and that we do this creatively, in concert with  axiologically ambiguous potentials present in the depth structures and flows of  nature itself. semiotically potent ejects from the unruly ground of nature call  upon creatures like us to realize their axiological significance both through con- struction and encounter. And we need to construct and encounter sacred folds  in time and space in order to perceive the revelatory manifestation of nature  naturing within the manifold orders of nature natured. We don’t just do these  things spontaneously; we teach one another how to read the axiological signs  and how to make real the axiological potential that surrounds and pervades  our bodies and our groups, our heritages and our histories.  n. scott momaday has it right. our world is full of sacred realities, powerful  things. sometimes we have to see it for ourselves to believe it. And sometimes  we have to believe it to see it at all. AJTP 34_1 text.indd   16 1/11/13   2:36 PM </page> </plain_text>
