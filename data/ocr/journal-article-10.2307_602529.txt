<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOMINAL SYNTAX IN THE LANGUAGE OF CODEX VATICAN NEOFITI 1: THE GENITIVE RELATIONSHIP DAVID GOLOMB THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS The three possible expressions of the genitive relationship in the Aramaic MS, Targum Neofiti I are analyzed and general guidelines for the use of one form over another are enunciated. It is shown that Type A genitives (e.g., brvh dv wsp) are marked, Type B (e.g., br' dviswsp) are unmarked; whenever an expected Type A or Type B genitive is not found, Type C (the "construct state") is the preferred alternative. Combined genitive forms are also discussed. It is demonstrated that certain fixed translation idioms had to be employed for specific theological or technical reasons. 1 INTRODUCTION As IS WELL KNOWN, ARAMAIC HAS THREE POSSIBLE CONSTRUCTIONS FOR expressing the genitive relation- ship. Questions concerning Aramaic syntax have always been problematic, in particular the intriguing problems of the relationship between these genitive expressions. It is the distribution of the three genitive constructions in one MS that forms the subject of this article. Before conclusions concerning the different uses of these forms in Aramaic in general can be formulated, their occurrence in a variety of different Aramaic dialects requires analysis. As a preliminary step, this study will focus solely on the language of the book of Genesis in the Targum MS Neofiti 1.1 At present, the choice of one construction over another often appears arbitrary, or stylistically motivated at best.2 However, we are now in a position to give some general guide- lines that do account for the use of one construction over another in certain environments in the Targum Neofiti 1. The three genitive constructions can be conveniently stylized in the following manner, and they will be referred to hereafter according to type: Type A: bryh dvwsp / bareh dayosep/ 'the son of Joseph'; i.e., noun with anticipatory pronominal suffix + d + noun Type B: br' d} wsp/bzrd' dayosep/ 'the son of Joseph'; i.e., noun + d + noun Type C: br ywsp /bar yosep/ 'the son of Joseph'; i.e., noun + noun (the "construct state") In some respects, a Targum is indeed a "translation" of the Hebrew Bible; but it is clearly much more than that. Any given verse may be a verbatim translation from the Hebrew; or it may be a paraphrase of the Hebrew, to a greater or a lesser extent; or it may constitute an exegetical expansion of the Hebrew text The transliteration of Hebrew vowels in this paper is as follows: based on the forms in the Biblia Hebraica Stutt- gartensia, long vowels spelled with mater lectionis (v/ w) are marked by a circumflex, long vowels without are marked by a macron; final h is marked only when spelled with mappiq; reduced vowels other than szuia are raised. This MS, the only complete copy extant of the Palestinian Targum, was first discovered by A. Diez Macho in the Vatican Library in 1949. Since its publication in 1968 (Genesis) and subsequent years (Exodus 1970; Leviticus 1971; Numbers 1974, and Deuteronomy 1978), a large bibliography has accumulated around it, much of which can be found in the last volume: Neophyti I, Tomo V, Deuteronomio, Alejandro Diez Macho (Madrid, 1978) pp. 13*-25* (Bibliografia targumica). 2 In his discussion of Biblical Aramaic, T. Muraoka ("Notes on the Syntax of Biblical Aramaic," Journal of Semitic Studies 11 (1966), 151-67) also points out that the choice between the status constructus and the periphrastic construc- tions are arbitrary. Nevertheless, he has determined, for Biblical Aramaic, "certain conditions which lead to the choice of one of the two alternative ways of expression" (p. 153). 297</page><page sequence="2">298 Journal of the American Oriental Society 102.2 (1982) with no literal relationship to it whatsoever. Much of the difference in usage between the three genitive constructions is indeed the result of the Vorlage they are being used to translate. The targumic "translator" was working within a very rigid rabbinic tradition,3 and was not necessarily free to choose creatively whichever expression he wished. This is particularly apparent when one considers the three genitive types, for there are numerous fixed formulae and frozen phrases that clearly had to be employed in certain circumstances. Menahem Z. Kaddari4 has studied the nominal syntax of Targum Onkelos from a diachronic point of view, and has described the chronological development from Type C to Type B as due to the influence of East Semitic forms with s'a.5 He also analyzed the language of those parts of Targum Onkelos that have no Masoretic Vorlage, with a view to fixing the connec- tions of Onkelos to other dialects. This present study, by contrast, concentrates solely on a synchronic analysis, with a view to describing the functional relationships between the three "synonymous" con- structions. In a different vein, Jonathan Shunary6 has discussed the avoidance of anthropomorphism in the Targum of Psalms using a statistical approach. His study focused primarily on the translation of the parts of the human body attributed to God mentioned in the Hebrew text, and on the general principles of avoidance. He found that, in the Targum of the Psalms, only one quarter of the instances actually showed avoidance and circum- locution, but he did note a special sensitivity to theriomorphism. This present study analyzes the various translation techniques used in Neofiti for the main appellatives of God, YHWH, and elhhim, as well as less commonly occurring idioms. By and large, traditional grammars of Aramaic have dealt sparingly with syntax, and have usually avoided completely the question of the relationship between these different genitive constructions.7 In general, one can say the following concerning the genitive relation- ship in the Aramaic of Neofiti: (a) It is possible to isolate some categories of nouns, according to the type of genitive construction they employ; (b) notable among these are nouns expressing in- alienable possession8 including (but not only) kinship terms, avoidances of anthropomor- phisms, and what we call here "technical or reli- gious translation formulae;" (c) combinations of genitive constructions are usu- ally of the type that begins with Type C or Type B-combinations beginning with Type A, or where Type C follows anything but another Type C are rare; (d) the language of the Masoretic Vorlage must always be taken into account. Furthermore, the translation utilizes (at least as regards this one 3 Martin McNamara, Targum and Testament (1972), p. 49, also points out that "the task of the meturgeman was scarcely that of rendering the Hebrew text into Aramaic for the first time. Nor was he likely to have had the liberty to render the Hebrew text at will." See also, A. Sperber, The Bible in Aramaic, Vol. IVb (1973), p. 2. 4 "Iyyunim batahbir 139ono gel Onkalos," Tarbiz, Vol. 32 (1963), 232-51.

For Blau, intrinsic nouns have two features: (I) they are "firmly anchored in context;" and (2) they display a "tendency toward concreteness." The essential feature of such nouns is, of course, the intimate connection in the mind of the speaker between the noun and the possessor. Hence, the intimacy of such a phrase as 26.1 j'wmwy d brhmn 'the days of Abraham', referring to 'the lifetime of Abraham' is apparent, whereas, for comparison, one can take 18.12 vwmy tvwti, 'the days of my youth' as a case of "simple" possession. The term "inalienable" in this present study reflects traditional usage rather than a strong preference against Blau's "intrinsic," although this latter does not seem to express "everything that naturally belongs to a given context" (p. 32) with greater felicity than does the more conventional "inalienable."</page><page sequence="3">GOLOMB: Nominal Syntax in the Language of Codex Vatican Neofiti 1 299 syntactic feature) numerous highly stylized for- mulae that had to be used in certain circum- stances. 2. NOUNS INDICATING INALIENABLE POSSESSION. 2.A. Kinship Terms. The following kinship terms are included in this discussion: 'b 'father', 'h, 'brother', 'hh 'sister', 'm 'mother', 'mh, 'handmaid', th 'wife', br 'son', brh 'daughter'. The semantics of kinship terms dictate that the possessor will always, of course, be a human being, or a group of human beings. Most of the examples (9 1%) occur in passages with a Masoretic Vorlage, usually a Hebrew construct form. The first four terms ('father', 'brother', 'sister', 'mother') occur a total of 31 times, all translating Hebrew constructs, and all translated by Type A genitives.9 With one exception, the five examples without Vorlage also use Type A. Similarly, the noun "mh 'handmaid' always trans- lates the Hebrew construct giphat; there are two cer- tain Type B genitives, 16.8 and 25.12 'mt' dsrvl/dsrh 'the handmaid of Sarai/ Sarah'. As regards 'th 'wife', there are two certain Type B genitives, 'tt' dnhwr (24.15) and "tt' d'hwv (38.9); the other 25 occurrences are Type A. In the plural, the Hebrew construct nege 'wives of' is translated four times by Type C, n v, and only once (4.23) by Type A, nsuhv dlmk 'Lemech's wives'. 2.A. 1 'Son'/'Daughter'. The situation concerning the very frequently occurring noun br 'son' (and also brh 'daughter') presents a more complicated picture. In the singular, the form brvh d- occurs three times, the form hrh d- five times, all for the Hebrew construct ben. These five spellings brh appear to consist of the 3fs suffix three times and the 3ms suffix twice, though of course all five could also be interpreted as the determined state. In the plural, Type A (bnw(h)y' d- 'sons of .. .') occurs 40 times for the Hebrew plural construct bene?. The forms brtyh d-/brth d- 'daughter of . . .' occur six times for the Hebrew construct bat, and twice in a passage (34.31) that has no Masoretic Vorlage. The determined state with 'aleph (i.e., Type B) occurs with this noun only once, 36.10 br' d'dh 'the son of Adah', also for Hebrew construct ben. On the other hand, the Aramaic construct (Type C) is used, but in the following rather specific circumstances: (a) expressions of age-br t?'cvn wts' ?nvn 'ninety- nine years old' (17.1), brt tit ?nvn 'three years old' ( 15.9, Hebrew mesulleset); (b) expressions of membership-br byt' 'member of my household' (15.2), br MmY 'member of my people' (19.38, translating the proper name ben Cammf), br n?(.') 'man','0 gwzl br lwn 'pigeon' (15.9), spu'r br 'Oln 'young goat' (37.31), brt btw'l 'the daughter of Bethuel' (24.47), bnv 1ys~r'I 'sons of Israel' (etc., 32.33), bni 'n?' 'men', gdvl' bn' Cvzjyv' 'goats' (27. 16, Hebrew gedave hd'izzim), bnt ysr'l 'daughters of Israel' (30.13); (c) compound kinship terms-br brh 'his grandson', br 'hwvt' 'son of his brother', br "hth 'son of his sister', brt "hwiv drvbwnv' 'the daughter of the brother of my lord' (24.27), bnv bnl'hwn dcm'D 'the sons of the sons of the people' (16.5). In the case of these eight kinship terms, the preferred expression of the genitive relationship in this MS, either in passages with a Masoretic Vorlage or without, is overwhelmingly Type A, Type B being restricted to six examples in three words, and Type C being restricted to 20 cases of the singular or plural of br, 8 of brt. Many of these, however, occur in fixed idioms usually paraphrasing a particular Hebrew idiom." 9 E.g., 'bath wn d-; 'be l d-; 'h wy d-; 'h wh d-; 'Ityvh d-; I'th d-; mh'n d-; 'mh d-. In this MS, final heh can represent the definite article, the 3ms pronominal suffix, or the 3fs pronominal suffix, hence some of these forms can be interpreted as determined, i.e., Type B, though this seems unlikely given the general preference of all kinship terms for Type A. I am grateful to Prof. Richard Steiner of Yeshiva Univer- sity for pointing out to me the fact that the synagogue inscriptions published by Joseph Naveh seem to show that the 3ms and the definite article were almost always written with heh in the Jewish Aramaic of Palestine. As a consequence, one might interpret many of the instances of 'aleph for the determined stated in Neofiti as being due to later copyists with relatively poor knowledge of Aramaic. 10 Many times, often written as one word, i.e., a fixed lexical idiom which has sometimes retained its old spelling. There are 179 total examples (excluding the fixed lexical item brn?, etc.). Of the 163 forms with Vorlage, 80% (130) are of Type A, 3% (6) are of Type B and 17% (27) are of Type C. Of the 16 forms without Vor/age, 88% (14) are of Type A, 12% (2) are of Type C. There are no examples of Type B. There are also 17 examples of Type A, i.e., those ending in -h, that could be interpreted as determined state, in which case the genitive would be of Type B. But even if all these are</page><page sequence="4">300 Journal of the American Oriental Society 102.2 (1982) 2.B. Other Terms. There are six very common nouns used in expressions of inalienable possession which also occur exclusively or primarily in Type A, again usually in fixed or formulaic expressions: 'pyn 'face', byt 'house', hvyn 'life', yd 'hand', ywm 'day' and sm 'name'. When these nouns do not occur in Type A genitives, the preferred expression of the genitive is then Type C. As was the case with the kinship terms, there are very few cases of Type B genitives with these words, when compared with Types A and C. Many of the occurrences of these nouns do not have a human possessor in the genitive relationship, as was the case with the kinship terms, and this fact may account for the relatively greater occurrence of Type C genitives with these words when compared with the kinship terms. With these words, the preferred expression of the genitive relationship in this MS is Type A, with 62% of the examples (65 out of 105). Type B .accounts for under 6% (6 out of 105, 2 with the word byt, 2 with Yd, 1 with Ywm and 1 with sAm). Statistically, Type C appears to have a much greater distribution than in the kinship words (32%, or 34 out of 105 cases), but these include 15 used in phrases with the word 'py and 12 with the word i'wnm (especially ywtmy hk'wy d- 'the days of the life of' for Hebrew vameJ). The plural noun 'pvn 'face' occurs in the Type A phrases 'Aph d(kl) 'r" 'the face of (all) the land' three times, and 'pwY d- (five more times). There are also nine examples of Type C, 'p 'v + noun, all of them translating the Hebrew construct plural p:ne. Further- more, the Hebrew hasadde is consistently translated by the idiom 'py br'/brh 'the face of the uncultivated land', six times. The noun bot 'house' occurs often in the MS, both in verses which translate the Hebrew construct bet and in verses which have no Vorlage. There are 17 cases of bet translated by Type A, one abbreviation (24.38 b'v'Viv' d'b', also for the construct bet), and one example of Type A that translates the Hebrew directive beta hitu2l 'to the house of Bethuel', viz., /bi vtvh dbtwl/. There are five examples of Type A in verses without a Masoretic Vorlage, including two abbreviations byyty' (16.5 and 38.25). Type B occurs only twice, 24.7 byyt' d'b ' 'my father's house' and 31.14 byt' d'bwnn 'our father's house', both for Hebrew construct bit. The construct byt, Type C, is used only in formulae, mostly in verses without Vorlage, or in idioms which expand a single word in the Hebrew: (a) without Vorlage-hsn byt qd~h/qd?' 'the lan- guage of the sanctuary' (three times, plus 35.18 spelled kwn!);'2 byt mqdg' 'temple' (24.62 and 27.27); byt mdrPD/mdrhuwn '(their) academy' (25.22 and 34.31); bvt mrcv 'pasture' (13.7); bit t/dwwtY 'the house of my birth' (16.5); (b) expansions of Hebrew - bYt mqdsy' 'temple' (28.22, paraphrasing the Hebrew bet Del/hjim); b't nhwr 'window' (6.16, Hebrew sohar); byt 3pr 'best' (23.6, Hebrew mibhar). jvHymn 'life', plural noun only, is used solely in Type A. There are five examples of the singular form of the noun vd'hand' of Type C which translate the Hebrew construct lad, and one (30.22) in a passage without Vor/age. There are also two clear examples of Type B. In the plural, there are four examples of Type A, two translating the plural construct ylde, two translating the singular construct v'ad. There are also three examples of Type C i'dy, one for the singular construct yad, and two in verses without Vorlage. There are only two singular examples of lwm i day', both of Type B, however, in the plural, Type A vwtmnw d-, occurs six times all translating the Hebrew plural construct l me. Besides these, there are fifteen examples of Type C, two of which paraphrase idiom- atic Hebrew phrases (7.10 lswp sbct vwmiy DbP 'at the end of the seven days of mourning', Hebrew lasib'at haYvdmim and 29.27 sb'tyj lpwinm mitpt' dD 'the seven days of this feast', Hebrew sabiaac ZO(c)t, one (18.12 vwmrv tU ptv 'the days of my youth') without Vorlage, and 12 translating the Hebrew plural construct s ame. Finally, the noun atm 'name' occurs in all three possible genitive types. Of Type A, there are 21 examples, only one of which is spelled unequivocally as included in Type B rather than Type A, the situation is not markedly altered, the percentages according to type then being: Type A - 70%, Type B - 13%, Type C -17%. It should also be noted that the 28 forms of Type C (the "construct state") are all to be found with the words 'son(s)' and 'daughter(s)'. Most of these cases are in fact fixed idioms, and presumably are to be found in all periods of Aramaic. 12 Cf. Abraham Tal (Rosenthal), "Ms. Neophyti 1: the Palestinian Targum to the Pentateuch," Israel Oriental Studies, 4 (1974), 31-43, especially pp. 35-7, for examples of the influence of Hebrew in this MS.</page><page sequence="5">GOLOMB: Nominal Syntax in the Language of Codex Vatican Neofiti 1 301 smyh d-.'3 There are only two examples that are clearly Type B, spelled sm' d-, one for the Hebrew construct Mm, and one without Vorlage; and there are four examples of Type C, three in passages without Vorlage in the phrase s.m 'prkywthwn 'the name of their provinces', and one (33.20) wsly tmn b~m YYY 'lh' dv'r'l 'and he prayed there in the name of the Lord, the god of Israel', paraphrasing the Hebrew wayyiqrd'-l6 Del 'elohe yisradl (cf. also the many examples of ?m + mmrvh dYYY in section 4.A). The plural construct ?mht translates the Hebrew plural construct s3mot three times. These are the only plural examples. If all the Type A nouns in this group spelled with final heh are read as Type B, Type A would represent 45% of the cases (rather than 62%), Type B 23% (rather than 6%), and Type C again 32%. However, it is doubtful that all should be so read, indeed, especially when we consider that, as seems to be indicated for this MS, Type B is not preferred in formulaic expressions. The situation concerning the nouns that have no Vorlage appears, at first blush, to contradict that of the nouns with Vorlage. Of 30 total examples, 10 (33%) are of Type A, 2 (7%) of Type B and 18 (60%) of Type C. However, the small size of the sample does obscure the state of affairs, as does the fact that 9 of the 18 examples of Type C are of one word, byt. Nevertheless, even taking this sample as it is, the fact remains that Type A is used in at least 56% of the total cases, Type B in just 6%, and Type C in 38%. 2.C. Conclusion. The situation with nouns expressing inalienable possession is very clear-Type A is over- whelmingly the preferred expression of the genitive. This is so in part because the possessor (or what Kaddari calls member B of the phase) in such expres- sions is usually a human being (though not necessarily with expressions other than kinship terms, as we have seen). Of the sample of 179 examples of kinship terms, 8 1 % are of Type A, 3% of Type B, and 16% of Type C. Of the sample of 135 non-kinship terms, 55% are of Type A, 6% of Type B, and 39% of Type C. When totaled together, the entire sample of 314 examples of terms used to express inalienable possession consists of 70% Type A, 4% Type B, and 26% Type C (see Table I below). 3. COMMON FIXED IDIOMS. 3.A. Common Idioms. There are a number of nouns in the MS that are used primarily in certain oft-recurring expressions. Certainly in the text of Genesis, such idioms as 'the god of. . .', 'the land of . . .', 'the king of.. .', etc. appear often enough to enable certain conclusions to be drawn as regards the use of the idioms. The words included here in this section are lhD '"god', 'rT" 'land', gnt' 'garden', hyyt '(animals', m/k ''king', n~mh 'breath', 'bd-'(servant', cwp ''fowl', 'pr' 'dust', tr" 'door'. This list is by no means exhaustive; the words chosen merely occur frequently enough in the same or similar expressions to enable patterns to be determined. The immediate conclusion that can be drawn is that in these common expressions, Type B is not only an acceptable form, but indeed the overwhelmingly preferred expression of the genitive. The phrase 'the god of . . .' occurs a total of 25 times, and 11 of those occurrences are of Type B, '/h ' d-. There are also 9 examples spelled 'lhh d-, some or all of which may also be Type B. Most of the examples are of the form /'Ih' 'lhh dPN'the god of PN' (14 cases), however there are also 2 cases of -'h ' dsmy' 'god of the heavens' (plus 17.1 '/h' S'my '!, presumably a copyist!scribal error for '/h smy', see below) and 2 cases of '/h'1 '/hh d'cmr' 'god of the world'. Three of the examples contain the word 'father'; all but one of the above translate Hebrew 'el/Jh. The Masoretic idiom 'el sadday occurs three times, twice (28.3 and 35. 11) rendered by the sole instance of Type C, '/h srmy(y)' 'god of heaven', presumably a standard translation for this Hebrew appelative, and one (17.1 mentioned aove) by '7h' sm '. Hence it seems reasonable to suggest that this be amended on the basis of the other two cases to a Type A also, '/h sm. '. Finally, there is only one sure example of Type A, 31.42 '/hyh dab' 'god of my father', also translating Del/he, however presumably at least three, if not more of the nine forms spelled 'Ihh could be also Type A.14 " The other 20 examples, all spelled ?mh d-, appear to consist of nine cases of the 3fs suffix and 11 cases of the 3ms suffix, although all may also be interpreted as the deter- mined state, i.e., Type B, cf. note 9. 14It might be suggested that the forms ending in -h that could be interpreted as Type A are those in which the possessor noun refers to a human being, cf. section 2 above, viz. 24.12 and 24.48 'lhh drubwnv 'brhm 'the god of my lord Abraham', 28.13 and 32.9 'Ihh d brhm 'the god of Abraham' and 'Ihh dyshq 'the god of Isaac' respectively. However it should be noted that counter examples of Type B genitives</page><page sequence="6">302 Journal of the American Oriental Societv 102.2 (1982) The Type B phrase 'r" d- 'land of' (+ toponym) occurs 21 times (17 translating the Hebrew construct weres, 4 translating the Hebrew directive 'arsd). Unlike the above examples, all five cases of Type A genitives are followed by an ethnonym, rather than a toponym. Chapter 21, vss. 32 and 34 both have 'rchwn dplst'Y 'the land of the Philistines', for 'eres palisufrm; chapter 36, vss. 16, 17 and 31 have 'rchwn d'dwmyyv'the land of the Edomites', for Deres 'edom. Finally, there are also four definite occurrences of Type C genitives.'5 Furthermore, there are no less than 10 other occurrences of the determined 'r" (= [Dar'a] used in a construct (9 of which translate the Hebrew construct 'eres; one, 29.1 IDr'D mdynhc 'to the land of the east' is for the Hebrew directive 'arsd bane qedem), and these are presumably all copyist errors for the construct 'rC (- [caraj). 'The garden of Eden' occurs seven times in the MS, and there are two clear examples of Type B, two of Type C. The other three forms end in -h, and can be interpreted either as Type A or Type B. 16 Similarly, the phrase 'animals of the earth' is of limited distribution in Genesis, occurring six times, all in Type B, hv(y)tc dcrc" (all for the Hebrew construct Iawvvat hd'ares, except 1.24 for the archaic Hebrew form haypto6-eres). Furthermore, the Hebrew hayyat- has'sade is translated three times also by Type B h yt d'py brc (brh) 'the animals of the wild'. There are no examples of Types A or C; however note should be taken of 31.39 hywt br' (= kyyt?) 'wild beast', para- phrasing the Hebrew idiom ganzibt layld. The situation as regards the common phrase 'king of.. .' resembles that of the other two frequently occurring nouns mentioned above, 'god of . . .' and 'land of. . . .' There are 28 examples of the genitive of the word 'king' in the MS, three of which are of Type A, 25 of which are of Type B. There are no examples of Type C. The 3 examples of Type A all translate the Hebrew construct melek, however, in two of these, 14.1 and 14.9, the Hebrew melek g'yim 'king of Goiim' is understood to refer to the nations in general, not to a place, and so is rendered mlkhwn d'(w)my' 'king of the nations'."7 Of the 25 examples of Type B (most of which occur in Ch. 14), 23 are written mlk', only 2 m/kh, and one is abbreviated mlk'; in 21 of the 25 cases, mlk' d- translates the Hebrew construct melek + (toponym). There is one plural genitive, 16.5 mrky' d'rc 'the kings of the earth', in a passage with no Vorlage. The phrase 'breath of life' occurs five times in the Targum of Genesis, all in Type B genitives. Three of the cases are spelled ns'mh, the other 2 examples are 2.7, ns'm' dhkyyn and 6.17 ns'wm' d~-yyn.'8 The situation with 'bd' 'servant' differs from singu- lar to plural. All three singular examples attested are of Type B, 'bd' d'brhm 'the servant of Abraham' (24.34, 24.52, and 24.59; cf. n. 9, above), all translat- ing the Hebrew construct 'ebed. The five plural examples found in the MS, however, are of Type A 'bdwy dyshq 'the servants of Isaac' (26.19, 26.25, and 26.32), 'bdwy d by/mlk 'the servants of Abimelech' (21.25) and 26.15 cbdwy dDbwy 'the servants of his father', all five translating the Hebrew plural con- struct cabdW. There are no examples of Type C in either singular or plural. Another common idiom in the early part of Genesis is 'fowl of the heavens', occurring nine times in all, and always translating the Hebrew 'op hagsamayim. Six times the Aramaic translates by Type B, cwp' dsmy' (though 1.26 is abbreviated cwp' and 2.19 is spelled with -h, cwph) and three times it uses Type C of this kind can be found, e.g., 24.27 'Ih' drlvhwny 'brhm, and 26.24 'lh' d&amp;brhm. 11.28 'rc tIdwwyvah 'the land of his birth', 22.2 Jrc twr mwrvh 'the land of the mountain of Moriah', 31.3 Drc Dbhtk 'the land of your fathers', and 32.3 l'rc gbI' 'to the land of Gabla', the first three for the Hebrew construct Deres, the last for the directive 'arsd (?seir). 16 As could the abbreviation gynt' dYYY in 13.10, cf. section 4.B. below. 17 The third example, 26. 1, translates melek paIitfrnm 'king of the Philistines'. The spelling here, mrk 'hwn (!) dpIf 'y, is anomalous, however, and represents an error in which the scribe added the suffix -hwn to the determined mirk' he had already written. This can be seen from 26.8, where the same Hebrew phrase is translated by mrk' dply~t y, indicating that 26.1 is indeed an error consisting of m/k' + hwn. The form mlk' dplygt'y in 26.8 is unusual, given the principle men- tioned above of translating an ethnonym by Type A, a toponym by Type B. However it is just the error form mrk'hwn dpl/ty in 26.1 that is instructive, indicating that the principle holds true. For, while the unique mlk' dplv~t'j may be explained as an aberration, or a simple error, the form in 26.1 must be understood in terms of an attempt to reproduce a desired noun, even in the face of a resulting inconsistency in the spelling. " The spelling with -w- to indicate a vocalic gowd is not unusual in this MS, especially in the environment of a bilabial.</page><page sequence="7">GOLOMB: Nominal Syntax in the Language of Codex Vatican Neofiti 1 303 wp smy'D There are, as might be expected, no examples of Type A. There are only three occurrences of the phrase 'pr' d'r" 'dust of the earth', always written thus, a Type B genitive. All translate the Hebrew construct capar. The phrase 'door of . ..' occurs some 15 times in Genesis, 5 times translating the construct petah, 6 times for the construct saCar and once for the con- struct hall6n. Three of the examples are in para- phrases of the Hebrew text. However, unlike the previous words in this section, Type C is the preferred genitive, occurring in 11 of the 15 examples, trc lbh 'door of the heart', trc msknvh/msmknh/mgkn' 'door of (his) tent', trc biyth 'door of the house', and trC qrtvh/qrtyhwn (sic) 'door (i.e., gate) of his/their city'. The remaining 4 examples are of Type B, tr' dt?vbwt' 'door of the ark' (twice), tr" dsdm 'door (i.e. gate) of Sodom' and trc dslw 'door of prayer'. There are no examples of Type A. 3.8. Conclusion. There are 10 common nouns dealt with in this section, comprising a total of 145 examples of the three genitives. Ninety-four (65%) of the cases occur with three nouns only, 'lh', 'rCD and mlk'. Of the 145 cases, 16 (1 1%) are of Type A, 96 (66%) are of Type B and 33 (22%) are of Type C. When we examine the situation with the 3 most common nouns, however, the picture is even more striking: Type A comprises 11 cases (12%), Type B comprises 66 cases (70%) and Type C comprises 17 cases (18%). Even if we consider as Type A all those forms ending in -h, the situation is still one in which the predominant form is Type B [Type A would then consist of 29 cases (20%), Type B 83 cases (57%) and Type C 33 cases (22%)]. It becomes clear from these figures that when one examines non- formulaic occurrences of commonly recurring nouns the preferred expression of the genitive is over- whelmingly Type B; but in its absence Type C is used (see Table I below). 4. DEISTIC EXPRESSIONS. 4.A. Anthropomorphic Avoidances. One of the most characteristic uses of the genitive with d- forms (Types A and B) in the MS is in expressions referring to God, usually in euphemistic paraphrases to avoid anthropo- morphism. The Masoretic forms YH WH and 'el/him are both translated by numerous expressions, pri- marily of Type A or of a combination of Type C followed by Type A. There does not appear to be any significant factor involved in the choice of which euphemistic expression translates which Masoretic form, although (?m) mmryh dYYY'(the name of) the word of God' does occur more frequently. The for- mulaic nature of some of these specialized translation techniques is again apparent in the almost total lack of Type B genitives. The most common circumlocution is Type A mmrvh dYYY 'the word of God' (variously spelled mmryh, mymryh, mmrh, and abbreviated mmry'), occurring 16 times, 6 times for elohim, 9 times for YHWH and once (20.6) for the determined hide15hyhm. There is only one clear example of Type B, mymr'd YY Y, translating ,elohl~m (21.23). The combined form sm mmrvh dYYY (Type C followed by Type A) also occurs frequently, six times for YHWH, four with the preposition b- translating base-m YHWH and once with the preposition 1-, trans- lating the Hebrew el in the phrase wa'aijh-am mizbjah lail. There is one sole example of a combined form Type C followed by Type B, Cm mmr' dYYY (15.6), also translating YHWH. The form ?mh dYYY, spelled only thus, occurs three times, twice for eelohtm, once for 'el. In 24.6, Type B ?M ' dYYY.'9 The smaller group of euphemistic avoidances is that involving the idioms Dyqryh dYYY'the glory of God' or Dvqr ?kyntyh dYYY'the glory of the Shekinah of God'. The first, Dyqryh dYYY, is Type A, and trans- lates the Hebrew Del5him all five times it appears. The second, Dyqr ?kyntyh dYYY (spelled differently only once, 35.13 Rkynth) is a combined form of Type C followed by Type A and twice translates Del/him, three times YH WH. There are two unusual forms: yqr(.') ?kvntyvi (so abbreviated) in 9.27, attempting a paronomastic para- phrase of the Hebrew verbal form w'jyiskon 'and he shall dwell', and similarly yqr ?kyntyh in 3.24, re- placing the Hebrew hakkarabim 'the Cherubim'. Finally, there is one anomalous form, 28.16 vqr ?kynh(!) dYYY (translating YHWH), i.e., the abso- lute form 9kynh, literally 'a Shekinah of God', presum- ably an error resulting from haplography, i.e., ?kvnth -s kvnhh -kynh.20 '9 The three cases of ?mh dYYY could also be interpreted as Type B. There are only two examples of Type C alone, 3.24 and 9.27, yqr ?kvntyh 'the glory of his Shekinah', both spelled anomalously and both in expansions of the Masoretic text. 20 This should probably be understood as a visual error by a copyist, cf. Michael Klein, "Notes on the Printed Edition of</page><page sequence="8">304 Journal of the American Oriental Societal 102.2 (1982) There are two cases where the Hebrew q6/ 'voice' is expanded in the MS, 3.8 q/ mmrh dYYY'the voice of the word of God', a combined form of Type C followed by Type A (or conceivably Type B, though this seems unlikely), for q61 YHWH and 3.10 q/ mmrk 'the voice of your Word', for Hebrew q6lkd. 4.1B. Other Terms. The fixed nature of the above formulae is dramatically highlighted when one exam- ines the other expressions involving the names of God (again usually translating the Masoretic YHWH or 'elohim) which do not appear to necessitate avoidance of anthropomorphism. In this group of expressions, Type B appears as an acceptable form. Indeed, of the 16 expressions involving the names of God used other than in technical or religious formulae, only one is clearly of Type A, four are clearly Type B, and there are only combined forms of Type C (e.g., twr mqd?' dYYY 'the mountain of the sanctuary of the Lord', 22. 14, for Hebrew har YHWH). Unfortunately, this is a verbj small sample, and conclusions must be tentative. The situation is further complicated by the orthographic alternation alluded to previously, viz., the possibility of spelling the determined state with either 'aleph or heh, since eight of these genitive examples are spelled with -h, and could be interpreted as Type A or Type B. A final complication is the use of abbreviated forms, making it impossible to tell whether a Type A or Type B genitive is intended. The evidence is as follows: The most common expression in this group is ml'kh dYYY 'angel of the Lord', used five times to translate the Hebrew mal'ak YHWH. There is also one clear Type B spelling ml'k' dYYY for Hebrew mal'ak 'elhhim. Similarly ambiguous is the Hebrew yir'at Del5him in 20.1 1, rendered by dhi/th d YYY 'fear of the Lord', while ,hittat 'elehim in 35.5 is translated by the same phrase dhlt' dYYY, clearly a Type B genitive. Finally, the Hebrew barak YHWH is twice translated brvkh dYYY 'blessed of the Lord'. The paucity of cases makes any firm conclusion impossible. The choice of genitive type clearly does not depend on the particular appellative of God used in the Hebrew; one may conclude that some of the eight forms spelled with -h are to be taken as determined state, i.e., they are Type B genitives, though how many and which cannot be fixed. There are four other single expressions using a name of God, and two paraphrases of Hebrew idioms. Two of these six examples are abbreviated, and again no firm conclusions are indicated. The forms are 13.10 gj'nt' dYYY 'garden of the Lord' (Hebrew gan- YHWH); Type B, 18.19 Dwrh ' dYYY'way of the Lord' (Hebrew derek YHWH); Type C + Type B, 22.14 twr mqds' dYYY'mountain of the sanctuary of the Lord' (Hebrew har YHWH); and Type A, 35.9 brktYh dYYY 'blessing of the Lord' (Hebrew birkat YHWH). The Hebrew idiom Dal-na yihar la Dd'ndy is twice para- phrased: 18.30 P k'n ytqp rwgz' dYYY 'let not the Lord's anger grow strong now' Type B, and 18.32 1P k'n Dtqp (sic) rwgz' (sic) dYYY. 4.C. Conclusion. The formulaic uses of deistic expres- sions indicate a preference for Type A (53%) or combinations of Type C plus Type A (34%), and there are less than 6% Type B genitives (three examples). In marked contrast, the non-formulaic expressions (even in the extremely limited sample available) do not have such restrictions. In this group, at least 5 out of the 16 (42%) are of Type B, and possibly as many as 13 out of 16. There is only one sure Type A, and one combined Type C plus Type B. (See Table I below.) 5. EXPANSIONS OF MASORETIC FORMS S.A. Exegetical Translation Formulae. One of the more striking characteristics of targumic language (as noted, indeed, by M. McNamara in passing in his chapter on Geography of Neofiti in his 1972 volume, Targum and Testament, cf. note 3 above) is the standard literary or exegetical expansions of various Masoretic idioms or place names. Some of these are well-known interpretive renderings, such as 'twn nwrhwn dksd'y 'the furnace of the fire of the Chal- deans' for 'ur kasdim 'Ur of the Chaldeans', though others are less obvious expansions of a Hebrew base, e.g., yhws tldwwtyh d- 'the genealogy of ...' (for Hebrew tolacdot, or zrcyyt bn(v)k 'the families of your children' (for Hebrew zera'). This section deals with a limited group of four exegetical expansion idioms, a regrettably small sample of only 26 examples, however the general system is clear. Seventeen of the 26 examples (65%) translate with a combined genitive idiom, nine with a simple genitive of Type A, B, or C. The idioms are 'twn nwrhwn dksd'y, y~hws tldwwtyh d-, qhl kny~t 'wmyn MS Neofiti I" in Journal of Semitic Studies 19 (1974), 216-30 for the confusion leading to haplography between the letters t and h.</page><page sequence="9">GOLOMB: Nominal Syntax in the Language of Codex Vatican Neofiti 1 305 sdlqvn and zr'yyt bnyk. The place name 'Cr kasdim 'Ur of the Chaldeans' occurs three times in Genesis (11.28, 11.31, 15.7), all of which are interpreted in Aramaic as 'twn nwrhwn dksd?l 'the furnace of the fire of the Chaldeans', i.e., a combination of Type C plus Type A. There is one further occurrence of this idiom, in 16.5, significantly in a passage that has no Masoretic Vorlage, however, here the genitive is Type C plus Type B(!), 'twn nwr' dksd',v. The common phrase in Genesis tolacdt PN 'the genealogy of PN' is translated in the Aramaic as a Type C plus Type A genitive construction five times, Th's t/dwwtyh dPN 'the genealogy of PN', including one case, 5.1 spr K1'hws t/dwwth d'dm 'the book of the genealogy of Adam'. There are two other occurrences, in one of which the possessor is not a human, ilzvs twldi.') smut 'the genealogy of the heavens' (Hebrew lad6t hassmavim), and here, as might be antici- pated, the second genitive in the chain is not Type A, but Type C. In the other, 36.9, the text has the anomalous form v'hws dc'sA, with t/dwvt ' written above the line in another hand. On the other hand, the Hebrew t6l;d6t is twice translated without 'hws, in 10.1 twldvwt bnwj' dnh 'genealogy of the sons of Noah' (here, too, Type C plus Type A), and 25.12 tidwt' dvgn?'l (sic) 'genealogy of Ishmael', as a simple Type B genitive. There are three Masoretic idioms referring to the nations, all of which are translated by a single technical expression in the Aramaic. In 17.4 and 17.5, the Hebrew ham6n g6oim 'many nations', and in 35.11 (g6o i u)qahal g6joim '(a nation and) a company of nations' are translated by the exegetical expression (Dmh w)qhl kni'st 'wmvn sd'qjn '(a people and) an assembly of a congregation of righteous nations' i.e. a Type C plus Type C combination. In 28.3, the Hebrew qahal 'ammim 'a company of peoples' is rendered by the impossible form qhl knistD(!) Dwmvn sd&amp;yqyn, presumably to be emended to knY't also, in line with the other examples listed above. The technical idiom zr'vit bn(v)k 'the families of your children', i.e., Type C, occurs three times (15.5, 15.13, and 28.14) all for Hebrew zar'eka (zarcakd in 15.13). There are also two cases of a Type B genitive (12.31 and 28.14) zr'l it' d'rcD 'the families of the earth', both for Hebrew nspahot ha adamd. (The form in 12.3 appears to be spelled zr'ywt', though this is probably due to the common confusion in this MS between us and i', i.e., read Zr'cyWt). Once (10.32), the same construct noun mispahot bane-n6ah is translated by a Type C plus Type A genitive, zr'Vt bnwv dnh 'the progeny of the children of Noah'. In a third example from 28.14, the Hebrew zarcaka is a simple rendered bnyk. As can be seen, exegetical expansion idioms tend to be combined genitive forms, and when they are, the Type C plus Type A variety seems to be preferred. In any case, all these combined genitive idioms in Genesis begin with a Type C genitive." 5.b. Expansions of Place Names. Many place names which are of the construct type in the Hebrew text are expanded in the Aramaic translation, usually by a Type B genitive." These at times reflect an interpretive rendering, at other times an apparent misunderstanding of the Hebrew place name. When a Hebrew construct place name is translated into Aramaic, the preferred form again is a Type B genitive. Of the 21 cases discussed in this section, 14 (67%) are of Type B, though perhaps the three spelled with -h could be considered Type A. These 14 examples 2 The breakdown is as follows, with the number of cases following the percentage in parentheses: Combined Forms - 65% (17) Type C + Type A - 42% (11) Type C + Type C - 19% (5) Type C + Type B - 4% (1) Uncombined Forms - 35% (9) Type A - 4% (1) Type B- 19% (5) Tipe C- 12% (3) There are also two much less commonly occurring absolute state Type B genitives. These occur in this MS primarily when the Hebrew being translated has an absolute construct, e.g., 'D/ln dprvn 'a fruit tree', for C's pari (1.11), 'mwd dm1h 'a pillar of salt', for nasfi melah (19.26), bhr dmvvn 'a well of water', for b3Djr ma lvim (21.19), and others. In all, there are 21 singular and plural separate cases of an absolute Type B genitive in the MS translating a Hebrew absolute construct, 7 examples with no Vorlage, and 8 in which the genitive expands a single Hebrew absolute noun. There is only one example in the MS of an absolute Type B genitive translating a Hebrew definite construct, 1.21 np? dhi ' 'a soul of a living creature', for Hebrew nepes haha 'Vd (cf. 1.20 and 1.30, which have the same Aramaic for the Hebrew absolute nepe6 hanad). 22 Some of these are discussed in a different context by McNamara op. cit., pp. 190-205 (cf. note 3 above).</page><page sequence="10">306 Journal of the American Oriental Society 102.2 (1982) also include one combined form of Type B followed by Type B, mdbr' db'rh dhb' (cf. note 25). There are five cases (24%) of Type C, including one combined form of Type C plus Type C (Cyn gdy tmry') and only one sure case (5%) of Type A, and that is the prepositional phrase bgwwh dqrh 'inside the city'. Even if the three examples spelled with -h are considered as Type A, the situation still remains heavily weighted towards the Type B genitives, viz., Type A = 19%, Type B = 57% (including the form mgdl' l'dr) and Type C =24%. The following examples belong to Type B. 10.1 1 pltywt ' dqrt ' 'the streets of the city, rahob5t 'ir 'Rehoboth the city', reading rah5bot as the common noun 'open places, markets'; 14.5 bgwwh dqrth 'in the midst of the city', b3?dwe(h)-qiryadti im 'in Shaveh- Qiryatayim', though the exact motivation for the 23 interpretation ba?dwv(h)=bgwwh is not clear; 14.6, 36.8 twr' dgbl' 'the mountain of Gabla', har sa'lir 'Mount Seir', with the identification Seir = Edom Gabla;24 18.17, 33.18 krkh dAkm 'the city of Shechem', the first example is in a passage without Vorlage, the second translates cir skem 'the city Shechem'. Both, of course could also be interpreted as Type A genitives; 21.14, mdbr' db'rh dsb'!'the wilderness of the well of seven', for the pausal midbar ba 'er ?ba "the wilderness of Beer-Sheba'. This translation breaks the name Beer- Sheba down into its constituent parts and creates two Type B genitives. It should be noted that the name ba'er saba' occurs 11 other times in Genesis, and in 10 it is translated simply as b'r ?b', however 21.13 is the only case preceded by midbar in the Hebrew;25 25.9 bmcrtp kpyl' bhql' dprwn 'in the double cave in the field of Ephron' i.e., determined noun plus adjective followed by a Type B genitive, for two Hebrew con- structs, bim'arat hammakpild bisdj(h) cepr6n 'in the cave of the Machpelah in the field of Ephron'. The first element in the phrase is interpreted as being from the root kpl 'double', the second is rendered by a Type B genitive, cf. below; 35.21 mgdl' I'dr!?'the tower of (?) Eder', Hebrew migdal- ceder 'Migdal-Eder' with I ford, perhaps an error of homoioteleuton due to the I of mgdl'. Much less frequently, the Hebrew construct place names are translated in the Aramaic also by a con- struct, i.e., by a Type C genitive: 10.30 twwri'(.) mdnhh 'the mountains of the east', Hebrew har haqqedem 'a mountain of the east(?)'. This is the only example out of 24 occurrences of the word twr that is spelled thus, with -ww-, though this spelling indicating a diphthong is known from Onkelos. Note also the occurrence of 'vwwnh 'dove', four times in this MS; 14.7 cin gdvi tmrc 'Ein Gedi of the Date- Palms', interpreting the Hebrew hasdson tdmdr; 23.19 mcrtt1.2?) ,hql kpvlD 'a cave(?) of a double field', for Hebrew m-cdrat WJdc-(h) hammakpila 'the cave of the field of the Machpelah'.26 23 Cf. McNamara, ibid., p. 203. 24 Cf. McNamara, ibid., p. 194. 25 The other "exception" is 46.1 where the Hebrew has a heh directive, walyydbD' b;Djrh Rdbat 'and he came toward Beer- Sheba', and this is mimicked in the Aramaic uv't' lb'yrh dsb' sand he came to the well of seven'. The situation in 21.14, however, appears to be a conscious exegesis of the Hebrew text. This is the first time that the place name Beer-Sheba is introduced in the Masoretic text, and it is the wilderness into which Hagar is cast. However, it is not given its name by Abraham, as the place where the covenant with Abimelech is consecrated, until 21.13! Hence, it appears this exegetical translation is arguing that the place mentioned in 21.14 cannot be co-referential with that mentioned in 21.31. The first, therefore, has been translated mdbr' db'r' dsb' 'the wilderness of the well of seven', utilizing the one possible meaning of the root sb' ('seven'); the subsequent cases are translated b'r sb', i.e., 'Beer-Sheba'. Presumably due to theological considerations, the derivation of the place name given in the Masoretic text, i.e., that utilizing the other meaning of the root ?b' ('to swear'), together with the consequent intentional ambiguous word-play has then been totally obscured in the Aramaic, since the Hebrew ki Mdam ni.fb;'( g;njhem 'because they both swore an oath there' is translated as 'rw m tmn q'ymw trYhwn qy'm 'because they both set up a covenant there'. Cf. also on the question of this name-derivation, Yair Zakovitch, "Explicit and Implicit Name-Derivations," Hebrew Annual Review, 4 (1980), 167- 80, especially p. 170, n. 5. This exegesis mav stand behind the discussion in some of the medieval commentators on the location of the wilderness into which Hagar was cast (as part of their apologetics for this apparently callous act by Abraham), cf. e.g., Ibn Ezra 'and he gave bread and water enough that would last her until Beer-Sheba because Abraham was in Gerar'. Note also Pseudo-Jonathan to this verse, wt't mn 'rh' lmdbr' dsmvk lbivr' dhbC 'and she wandered from the path into the desert that is next to Beer- Sheba'. 26 The spelling of the first word m crtl is anomalous and difficult to explain; the noun hql is, of course, feminine, as its descriptive adjective kpylD. Hence the genitive appears to be</page><page sequence="11">GOLOMB: Nominal Syntax in the Language of Codex Vatican Neofi- I 1 307 S.C. Conclusion. This final section presents us with the data that are the most difficult to interpret, but at the same time the most tantalizing. For in these expansions of Masoretic idioms we come face to face with the real essence of the targumic method. The interpretive exegesis (e.g., zr'cyvyt bnyyk) is at once the most subtle and the most opaque of the translation methodologies. Yet it is clear from the analysis just presented that these are fixed translation idioms-the "translator" was not at liberty to translate as he wished, but was obliged to render each "loaded" Hebrew term with its appropriate technical Aramaic equivalent, at once both translating and interpreting the biblical text. There are a total of 46 idioms discussed in both sections 5.A and 5.B. Simple genitives of Type A, B, or C comprise 59% (27 cases) of the examples, combined genitives comprise 41% (19 cases). Once again the sample is regrettably small, however the general outline is clear. The exegetical expansion idioms, both translation formulae and place names, contain 39% (18 cases) Type B genitives (but 67% of the simple, uncombined genitive forms). As we have noted pre- viously, the alternative to the preferred form is always Type C (15%, i.e. 7 cases, but 26% of the simple genitive form), one of which is a prepositional phrase. As regards combined genitive forms, the preferred idiom is Type C plus Type A (11 cases, 24%, but 58% of the combined forms). Similarly, the alternative to the preferred idiom is Type C plus Type C (6 cases, 13%, but 31% of the combined forms). Finally, there is one example of Type C plus Type B, and one Type B plus Type B. (See Table I below). 6. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS This analysis has suggested the following conclu- sions: (1) There are indeed certain fixed translation idioms that the translator presumably had to use for specific technical or theological reasons. These reasons are not always apparent; (2) Type A genitives are what we could call 'marked'-they are preferred in expressions indicating inalienable possession, or at least when the possessor is a human being, and also in special euphemistic phrases used to avoid anthropomorphism; (3) Type B genitives are 'unmarked'-they are preferred in other cases, most notably demonstrated in commonly reoccurring phrases, and also in those expressions referring to God that are not euphemistic avoidances. They are also found in expansions of Masoretic idioms, both fixed translation formulae and toponymic translations, though here also they must be viewed as unmarked, i.e., the "normal" genitive expres- sion; (4) Type C, i.e. "the construct state," is invariably the "second choice" when Type A or Type B is not used where one has come to expect it. The motivations for using Type C over the expected Type A or Type B are not immediately apparent; (5) Combined forms of these genitives are common, especially when translating highly technical religious idioms. In this case, combinations are usually Type C plus Type A or B (rarely Type C plus Type C or Type B plus Type B).2 an absolute Type C, with a descriptive adjective qualifying the nomen regens, translating the whole Hebrew construct chain. 27 This is the case in the book of Genesis. Once again I am indebted to Prof. Steiner for pointing out a counter example in Neofiti Numbers 19.17, qrnih di, vqdt twrth 'the ashes of the burning of the cow' (Hebrew 'apar iaripat hahattd(D)t), as well as for the observation that the use of the dy serves to indicate the syntactic structure, i.e., the bracketing of the phrase. In this case, it refers to [the ashes] [of the burning of the cow]. This is especially apparent when one realizes that yvqdt twrth is indeed a separate exegetical translation idiom in Numbers 19, translating the two Hebrew idioms iaripat happdrd (vs. 6) and iaripat hahattd(')t (vs. 17). Hence, it might be postulated that this unusual combination of Type B plus Type C (or even perhaps Type A plus Type C) exists because the phrase l'qdt twrth was perceived by the speakers as a single lexical item (perhaps similar to brnK mentioned above). The 'ashes' of this item, then, was rendered by the Type B (or Type A) phrase qtmh dv (yqdt twrth).</page><page sequence="12">308 Journal of the American Oriental Society 102.2 (1982) TABLE 1.
