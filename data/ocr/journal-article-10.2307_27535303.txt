<plain_text><page sequence="1">by F. L. Wells EXCURSION AMONG SPIDERS As Creatures and Symbols "XT'OU may take it that any spider will eat any other spider JL that it possibly can." So spoke to me many years ago that late dean of araneologists, Professor Emerton (apparently dis counting the social spiders of the tropics.) We were canoeing to gether down the Ipswich river, on the annual pilgrimage of a group of bird-lovers. A year later we were doing likewise. This time he broadened his statement to include eating all living animals, and with apparent justice, for surely the various reports of spiders eating snakes, lizards, birds, mice, means simply that they will eat any live animal that they can overcome.1 My araneid memories of Sewanee?all from the past century? are necessarily fragmentary. Most distinct are the Agalenids. They were numerous around the houses; sadistically we would sometimes amuse ourselves by capturing flies Tom Sawyer fash ion and hurling them into the net for the spider to seize and eat. There were Theridiids (tepidariorum) with their multiple egg sacs around the outhouses, and I remember some of the large grey "humped" Epeiras in our cellar. Field Epeiras must have been quite rare; I recall none myself, but one day my playmate Rupert Colmore showed as a great curiosity a large and highly colored one, I think an Argiope. He gave it to me because I already had a bottle containing alcohol with a garter snake and such like curios, and I kept it for several years. Some large hunting spiders, prob ably Dolomedes, I remember seeing at Tremlett Springs. One interesting variety, probably a Cyclosa, was relatively common. It was distinguished by the wide span of its web suspension "bridge," sometimes reaching (to memory) ten feet. Down the Xjudger, E. W. More Spider Hunters.

WELLS vertical axis would be the line of rubbish in the center of which rested the smallish spider. Of irregular shape and dull color, it was very hard to detect. Spiders are introverts, indeed the term fits them rather better than it does human beings. The hunters are objective introverts, the weavers subjective introverts. Flies on the other hand denote extraverts; they have an interest in the environment broader and more for its own sake, glabrous heads for example. The en vironment in part reciprocates; the spider sometimes inspires re spect for patient craftsmanship (Paul Veronese's painting), but hardly an apostrophe like Oldys' "Busy, curious, thirsty fly! Drink with me and drink as I . . ." etc. Flies, however, are subjective extraverts; their interest in the environment is broad but largely self-centered. For objective extraversion one must turn to such as bees and ants, who have environmental interests that go far beyond the bounds of self: How doth the little busy bee Improve each shining hour? He wastes it gathering sweets which he Will never help devour . . . This is the foil of altruism; when we find another who likes to make himself useful, we make him useful too. In our culture, the spider's symbolic value is distinctively evil. It serves to represent craft, greed, cruelty. In Southey's apostro phe, . . . thou emblemest the ways Of Satan, sire of lies; Hell's huge black spider . . .a Of the underworld creature of H. G. Wells' Time Machine, "The thing made me shudder. It was so like a human spider." A recent would-be extortioner in a Vermont community signed his demands "The Spider". On the other hand, in a contemporary "detective story" magazine bearing this name, the spider is the master detective; a symbolism here capable of various interpreta tions.3 2See also, less remotely, Lind, in the January, 1935, Sewanee Review, p. 48. 2Abraham, K.

"Spider" has many other figurative meanings through more objective channels, one of the commonest being frying pan?the vessel originally having multple legs to rest over a fire. An interesting and little cultivated branch of semantics would study the comparative tendency of different languages? resp. cultures to develop figurative meanings of this kind. Eng lish has perhaps a dozen figurative meanings of this kind for spider; French about as many for araign?e; German scarcely any for Spinne, and Russian similarly few for Pauk. "Foul spider" is a not uncommon predicate. Actually, spiders are cleanly in their habits, and their economic security so light as to force them to a dietary opportunism. Similarly the spider, like the cow, is commonly spoken of as "he" although the great ma jority seen are females. And a son-of-a-gun of a spider Crawled up the water spout . . . (It was probably an Agalenid that inspired this doggerel. For web weavers they are of a roving disposition, often found wandering away from any nest. They are frequently observed about the plumbing fixtures of country and suburban houses, fallen into the bowls, and unable to extricate themselves). Southey's "Old Free mason" was certainly figured as masculine. The case is reported among psychoanalysts of a man having a spider tattooed on his phallus; "putting the spider in his web" had to him the sense of Boccaccio's "devil into hell". Scripture adheres more closely to the sexual facts. The spider tafceth hpld with her hands, and is in king's palaces. So does Dor? in his headpiece to "The Succubus". The drawing shows an araneid monster, suggesting something be tween a tarantula and an Agalenid, with the head and breasts of a girl. In her front legs she holds a human heart. Tangled in the shelf-like web before her are dead men with their hearts torn out. There is a much broader tendency to attach symbolic values to 4Note on Volksetymologie: It is not for being caught in thq net of the law that one is "arraigned" in court. 4Maxwell, H.

Its tallest flower was the medieval Bestiary; contemporary instances seem motivated largely, though not wholly, by what the psychoanalysts call "projection", a psychic buck passing.

At this time, "lousy" signified "full of" rather than "poor quality"; thus the St. Regis region of the Adirondacks was described to me as "lousy with lakes"; and even today it is apparently intelligible to speak of "lousy" with sex appeal, or with delicacy. The eagle, which in our culture symbolizes freedom, courage and aspiration, can also denote cruelty and rapacity.5 In further evidence of the autistic nature of these attributions, consider the relative intelligence of the ass; the ambivalent qualities assigned to the dog; the emo tional life given to the crab; or the processes underlying such other associations as "copy-cat" or "fraidy-cat".

Frazer's Golden Bough, and for that matter the Bible, scarcely mention the creature. Wilstach's "Dic tionary of Similes" does not list it. But occasionally one meets with trends favorable to them. Thus there are traditions in which the hero escapes from enemies through spiders spinning webs be fore his refuge; or is encouraged to victory by contemplating the perseverance of a spider in climbing its thread;6 or escapes from enemies by means of a line which a friendly spider spins. "Ken tucky superstitions'*7 cites many ideas about spiders, a favorable content preponderating. On the other hand, "he" may be magi cally invoked to entangle the soul of an enemy, or tear it from the body.8 Mark Twain mentions a superstition of bad luck to kill a spider9. Around Sewanee there was a similar supersti tion about toads and the question suggests itself as to the func tional nature of such superstitions, protecting creatures useful, but effectively repellent, to man. Children's books occasionally try to mitigate the unmerited opprobrium attaching to these creatures. There is one in which Miss Muffet's araneid visitor, for example, is elaborated in a very amiable r?le. Our common aversion to spiders is almost certainly a learned and somewhat local pattern; maturation may play some part. It would scarcely have permitted the Arachne myth of classical Greece, nor can it be shared by those cultures where spiders serve as a food staple.10 They have otherwise been reported to be of a 6Cf.

Occasionally they are tolerated if not encouraged for vermin-destroying qualities (Hawaii); I have observed a cavatica web not more than twelve hours old, containing over sixty mosquitos. The popular stereotype of the spider is a creature sitting in a round web, with its head upward, and with six legs (in a recent lit erary illustration, ten. Odilon Redon's charcoal U Araign?e also has ten legs, surrounding a human face for a body; it may have been intended for a "harvestman" rather than a spider proper). There is a "mental test" form that shows a spider head upward in a round web. The actual habit of rest with head downward has various possible functions. Perhaps the principal one is that the spider, on sensing danger, may the more quickly protect itself by dropping; after a time varying from a few seconds to many minutes it returns, as a rule rapidly, not cautiously, by the silk it has paid out behind. Actually the "round" webs are spun by but one of perhaps ten families, that one knowln as the Epeirid. About half the families spin no snares at all, but hunt their prey on the surface. Some of these are great sports-folk, especially the jumping Attids. These are easily recognized by a head (c?phalo thorax) often wider than the abdomen, (streamlining) and very stout front legs. As contrasted with grasshoppers, they are "trac tors" instead of "pushers". The predominant color is gray, but they often have a marked iridescence. I have seen one of these little creatures capture a fly with a vertical upward standing jump of five time its own length upon a galvanized iron wall. In stalk ing for the spring, they can move like the minute hand of a watch. Strong-jawed, graceful and energetic (one writer calls them "im pudent") in their conduct, with none of the sprawliness that so contributes to our repulsion from most spiders, the Attid is the araneid replica of the amiable and vivacious little Boston bull. I wish them good hunting. A carnivorous habit conduces to, though it does not necessitate, a solitary one; and spiders are solitary animals par excellence. Obviously, if "any spider will eat any other spider" social life can not develop much; indeed the account by Gudger of "several large</page><page sequence="7">EXCURSION AMONG SPIDERS_81 spiders"11 feeding on a captured snake is far out of the ordinary. In the tropics are spiders that live in aggregations (like the tangles of daddy-long-legs, or harvestmen, I used to see in Sewanee), and I have seen in New Hampshire perhaps half a dozen small E. cavaticas deriving mutual support from each other's webs and those of larger fellows; but there is no real organization as with the social insects. Where social life is limited to mating, individual psychology is simplified, especially where mating is of the araneid pattern. If there is metempsychosis, the rational fate of the cad is to be come a male spider, particularly one of the Epeirids. Though the male is generally much smaller and weaker than the female he must still do the courting, subject to being eaten before mating if he approaches an unready female too closely, and eaten after mating if he does not quickly make his escape. Reversing the human r?le, it is now the male who dances for the stimulation of the female; and one of the more diverting spectacles of the ara neid world is a monstrous Dolomedes ("hairy water-spider") dancing attendance on the slightly larger, but no more humanly attractive female, who watches him in characteristic posture (see below), the type and pattern of malignant alertness. Waving the front legs in the air and dancing on the other six he sidles every minute or so within a few centimeters of the female who makes murderous lunges at him. Or the like process in the web of an Epeira, the little male furtively pulling the annunciator-wire to the female's leaf-tent, stealing a little closer to repeat the perform ance, scurrying as fast as his eight legs will carry him from the cannibal rush of the female and still coming back for1 more. The disparity in size of male and female may be very slight, as in some Lycosids, or may be about at 10 to I, as in Argiope riparia. Argi ope is distinctive among the common Epeirids in various ways.12 "Cf. Pinkus. xlRabaud, E. L'immobilisation r?flexe et Pactivit? normale des arthropodes. Bull. biol.

Insularis and trifolium sew themselves up in tents made of leaves from which not even the struggling of a good-sized insect in their round webs can be relied on to tempt them in daylight. I once saw a moth flutter into the net of an adult trifolium, who ensconced in her leaf-tent paid no attention to it. It was transformed to a nearby net of Argiope riparia who dealt with it in summary fash ion. The house-frequenting Epeirids fabricate no shelter of their own, but large ones (E. cavatica) often rest under the eaves of buildings, where their weathered wood color makes them incon spicuous. Argiopes on the other hand, more sporting or less sen sible (or with less evaporation from the body surfaces) spend their leisure in the center of their webs, inviting the first wasp or bird that sees them. (I suspect also that young spiders affect the orb centre more than older ones; or those that do die young). Proxi mate stimuli do not seem so disturbing to them as one would ex pect; in their stations they can often be lightly prodded or stroked without their paying much attention. On the other hand, I have known a riparia to drop from center to the ground in tonic im mobility upon the approach of an automobile to within about twenty feet. Lesser disturbances, as often incidental to pho tography, may cause such spiders to move to another part of the web, commonly upward. On then being stirred up further, they are likely to return to the center, which hardly contradicts the low estimate that students put on the intelligence of these creatures. Behavior known colloquially as "playing 'possum", techni cally as animal hypnosis or tonic immobility, is readily observed in spiders. In foreign literature will be found implications that it is easily induced in spiders generally.13 Among those observed (in some detail) by the writer, this would be valid only for the Epeirids, and the genera differ in susceptibility, as do individuals within species. As I have observed them, the most susceptible are the Epeiras proper. I have certainly never produced or other wise seen tonic immobility in Attids, only once in an Agalenid and in T. tepidariorum, though then very characteristically. The treatment needed to produce the semblance of it has been such as to predicate physical injury to the organism. The nature of 1?Cf. Rabaud; Savory; M. Thomas.</page><page sequence="9">EXCURSION AMONG SPIDERS_83 the really effective stimuli seems to be highly variable. It is dif ficult to observe in Lycosids and Linyphias, though the latter van ish from their webs on slight extraneous disturbance, which is prima facie evidence of susceptibility to that sort of stimulus; to mechanical shocks they are resistant. As between families and species this arneid hysteria or cataton?a runs generally opposite to the aggressiveness of the variety's other behavior patterns. Whether the Argiopes of Eastern Massachusetts do represent a more advanced cultural level it is impossible to say, but they have evolved the protective net (accessory to the orb; "wings," McCook; the "screen" of Emerton; the "barrier web" of Corn stock) to a further extent than is commonly reported in the litera ture. Sometimes it is no (more or less) dense mass of irregular threads, but a well-formed dome, having the same horizontal axis as the orb. Only once have I seen a good dome on both sides of the orb. This web belonged to a young A. transversa (?) and was only some three inches in diameter; both orb and domes were of specially dense and strong construction. But Except the Lord build the house?their labor is but lost that build it. On my next visit, three days later, net and domes were intact, but of the former owner were left only legs, still clinging to the center, c?pha lothorax and a few shreds of abdomen. The killer could scarcely have been a wasp, for it would have carried the whole spider away, nor could it or a larger winged creature have approached without wrecking the web. If another spider had successfully fought for the web, that spider would have been occupying. Sus pect is the descriptively named Mimetus interfector, a species of theridiid which make it their business to wander from nest to nest killing and eating the occupants.14 The occupants of epeirid webs do not appear to have a good defense against aggression of this sort. They are reasonably alert to the kind of stimulus supplied by an insect struggling in the web, but to gentle movements such as an approaching spider would supply they are quite insensitive. As noted, one may even touch them without greatly disturbing them. Attids are often to be seen lurking about the nests of orbweavers, and I have seen an Attid rush on a Linyphia resting in its web; but the latter was quick enough to save itself. The ag 14Cf. McCook, III, p. 389.</page><page sequence="10">84 by F. L. WELLS gressor has the element of surprise in his favor, as the stick-up man of our culture: Thrice armed he who hath his quarrel just But four times he who gets his blow in fust. With their exhibitionistic habitus, it is then not surprising if the individual Argiope does not survive so well as its less chance-taking cousins. In the field I have often followed an insularis or trifol ium nest for six weeks or more, but half this period is a good av erage for Argiope nests. Transversas seem more stable than rip arias. It has been not infrequent to find a new riparia web, empty of its regular occupant and in possession of a male who has prob ably escaped the enemy through relatively inconspicuous size and coloring. I recall especially one such nest, a fourteen inch orb equipped with a good protective net on each side. In the center sat a young adult riparia, a blonde, (i.e., with yellow marks on her legs instead of the more common brown markings.) Just above her were the mangled and eviscerated remains of a similar indi vidual, whether a dispossessed owner or repulsed aggressor, it is impossible to say.15 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace. But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils. There is something about these Argiopes, not the dowagers with egg-swollen bellies, but the d?butantes with their prominent blue-gray spearhead of a c?phalothorax, their lithe abdomens, their long but stout legs ex tended X-wise by pairs, to give them a special if quite illusory air of Amazonian defiance. Eight days later, victrix was attended by a little male keeping his distance on one of the protective nets, but two days later again she was gone, and the still intact nest oc cupied by a m?nage ? trois of males, all in the orb itself; two di rectly opposite each other on either side of the central "shield", the third resting about two inches above the first as though oc cupying stations in a ritual. This Utopian state of affairs ("any 15Later: too bad to spoil the romance, but it is as likely that in this and in the other case with Transversa, it was only a cast skin. 35Fearnley, G.

Three days later the w^eb was empty; it was still largely intact though one of the protective "screens" was considerably torn. The grasshopper is, like the butterfly, an established symbol of carefree lightheartedness. Great numbers of them frolic over the fields were these spiders were observed. Every so often one of them begins another ecstatic leap, and in midflight encounters the glutinous spirals of an Argiope, low-hung for just such as they. The ensuing microcosm of tragedy is familiar; the moment of frantic struggle, the eager descent of the terror, the winding of the shroud, the death-kiss (Fabre's metaphor) near the head, then the gradually fainter struggles inside the winding-sheet until poi son and /or loss of blood complete their work ... So are the sons of men sneared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them. Epeira stellata had a web in a juniper bush. In it she had caught two insects, each larger than herself, and in true Dives fashion, had gorged herself to the limit. During observation, valde defaecavit; still feeding briefly on one insect, then painfully on her short and thin legs hoisting herself perhaps three inches to the other one. Then she had to investigate something in another part of the web, and in doing so fell out; was too bloated to climb back, and never reappeared; doubtless made a dainty hors d'oeuvre for some carnivorous ants, or piece de resistance for an underfed hun ter of her own order. Many weeks later neighbor Lazarus, in the form of Acrosoma spinea, continued to eke out a modest existence. In compensation for which, spinea when at rest resembles a jew elled pendant much more than a conventional spider, whereas stellata is in aesthetic quality among the least distinguished of the group. But the psychological observer is denied these soul satisfying Deutungen of the moralist. The best he can say is that spiders are so fashioned that they must, like the Yahoos, "eat until they are ready to burst," and without the convenient relief to which the servants of the Houyhnhnms had access. For some years, a variety of wasp has been trying to establish a colony in a "portable garage" that I use for a sort of camp building. The same shelter serves a few individuals of T. tepid ariorum. Somatically this spider is among the weakest of its</page><page sequence="12">86_by F. L. WELLS kind. (Or at least so are those the writer has seen, here and in Sewanee. The Middle West nurtures a fiercer breed, according to Ewing). The globular brown abdomen, scarcely distinguishable from its own eggsacs, almost hides the microoephalothorax, the mouth-parts and legs are feeble. Wasps are perhaps the greatest enemies of spiders, invading the nests, paralyzing the occupants with a sting, and packing them as food for their larvae. But the race is not to the swift, and underneath the tangle of threads form ing these theridiid nests, there is a kitchen midden of discarded wasp fragments, and the products of their digestion. Between them, the scant half-dozen spiders have kept the wasp colony to a size where we humans hardly notice it. Tepidariorum knows her weakness and does not deny it. Skilfully keeping her distance she throws entangling threads with a patience required of no Epeira or still less, Agalenid. It is reported to have been a male T. tepid ariorum that captured the snake in St. Charles, Illinois, of later reference. Dickens could have found in this humble species the araneid model of Uriah Heep. It needs a very anthropomorphic outlook to endow spiders with emotional life. Of the triumphal dance of Dr. Bhattacharya's Argiope pulchella, he is careful to say "as it were" to express joy and excitement and other "emotions". At any rate it is an overt response associated with human emotion, to an emotion producing situation. Opposite circumstances occurred when I saw a farmer boy put a fat beetle-grub into the nest of some kind of Epeirid. The spider, which was feeding at the time, ran to the grub, bent it double, swathed it in the usual manner, and without biting returned to the unfinished business. The grub, having strong mouth-parts, promptly chewed its shroud open, and dropped to the ground and safety. / have a key in my bosom called Promise, that will I am persuaded open any lock in Doubting Castle. In some way the spider noticed this and ran again to the spot. Finding the prisoner escaped, the Giant &lt;(fell into one of his fits", rushed hither and yon about the net, in an excellent behav ioral pattern of what the psychiatrist calls distressed perplexity. Bhattacharya's Arigope seems to have been a better integrated in dividual, behaving in more sublimated fashion. Under similar frustration, it returned to its central resting place and there, having</page><page sequence="13">EXCURSION AMONG SPIDERS_87 no conventional Murad to light, "began to toilet its head and feet".16 As the posture of a human being offers basis for inferences about the personality within, so do the somatic "attitudes" of spiders suggest relationship to their behavioral ones. The essential factor is the position of the legs. (Though Argiope transversa has a way of cocking the abdomen at a rakish angle to the orb, and doing an occasional danse du ventre with it.) These resting postures range from straight extensions as seen in Argiope riparia, to the closely folded poses that may be seen in Cyclosas. Some Dolo medes show on a horizontal plane the two forward pairs nearly straight ahead, the third pair at right angles to the long axis of the body, the last pair nearly straight behind. Argiope riparia, more especially when young or masculine extends the two front pairs forward, the rear pairs backwards in X form. Within the field of these observations it holds generally that the more the resting position of the legs is extended, the greater is the aggres siveness of the species, and the more they approach to the folded pattern, the more the total habitus of the species is that of "folding up". Important exceptions, however, exist in the Attids and Tho misids, in whom the legs are specialized for their particular methods of capturing prey. The commonest Thomisids hunt not neither do they spin, but are liars in wait?embusqu?s. They sit in flowers, and seize in sects that come for honey?hijackers of the araneid world. They are flatly built, their often circular abdomens suggesting pills, and have a sideways gait that has given them the name of "crab spiders". The forelegs are largest and stoutest, decreasing in order inward, and all tend to curve forward. One August after noon I saw a number of them, ambushed in thistles. Their bodies were hidden in the petals, the legs extended upward in supplicat ing attitudes (cf. the praying mantis)?give us this day our daily bread. One had already received good measure, pressed down and running over. It had captured a butterfly not less than twenty leNote that tokens of tenderer emotion are absent.

L. WELLS times its own size, and the two were hanging together down the side of a thistle blossom. The spider's forelegs were clasped tightly about the butterfly's head, in which its own c?phalothorax was wholly buried; so that the spider's body, engorged to globular proportions, resembled (indeed I first thought it to be) a bright yellow tumor on the butterfly's head. The butterfly hung with its dorsal surface towards the flower-stem, its body was much shrivel led and it had obviously been dead for some time. It says much for the efficiency of this spider that it could so promptly master this large, flying prey, and maneuver it into the position where it was found . . . "fate of the beautiful on earth". Abraham Lincoln went far out of his way to assist a beetle help less on its back. Would the Great Emancipator have done as much for a beetle caught by a spider? It would be cheating the spider of its none-too-daily bread. A test of tender-mindedness probably as fair as most tests of the kind, is one's reaction to epi sodes of this very class. When a crow attacks a nest of robins are you impelled to help the "under dog", do you watch the slaughter with detached interest, or do you find a pleasurable self-identifi cation with the crow?

It would be of interest to know how these interferences are rationalized, and by what legal au thority they are undertaken. On n'est jamais de premier; but the instance of separating and then killing a fighting scorpion and spider, reported in the press of August 26, 1934, is at least the writer's first case of such interference, on a legal basis, between in vertebrates.

Or, per contra, which if any of these weaker creatures would you enjoy throwing to the stronger? a fly to a spider? a mouse to a cat? a bird to a cat? a rat to a terrier? a kitten to a terrier? I recall a young man employed as a domestic in a Sewanee establishment who was planning a course of self discipline along these lines, including for example to "coal-oil a cat"; i.e. soak the creature with kerosene and set fire to it.1* He mentioned some adepts so far advanced on this path that they had roasted in an oven a "suckling baby"; this may have been a pro jection fantasy, but he called by name the "boys" supposed to have accomplished this discipline in tough-mindedness. The "man-eating devilfish" is a symbol much used for literary representations of the macabre, and the feeding methods of the spider are on a smaller scale much like those of the cephalopod. The common element is eating the prey alive while holding it by many arms. "In those icy, black depths", (writes Beebe in The Arcturus Adventure, page 355,) "to be a small fish and to come within reach of such sinister arms, to be enfolded by the living umbrella, and then drawn slowly, irrevocably toward the wide open, gleaming beak, watched always by those cruel, lidless eyes ... a much more awful fate than could ever befall, on our dark est night, any creature breathing air." This is the natural fate of araneds prey, but it is probable that the enshrouding technique of the Epeirids carries the psychological "horror"19 a step farther. To bind and use (for food or otherwise) signifies a fuller mastery than merely to hold and use; and the respective r?les should be ade quate to most sadomasochistic demands. I am informed that this type-episode has been effectively presented in moving picture (Argiope riparia with grasshopper). H. G. Wells has briefly represented both themes; the holding (cuttlefish) in "The Sea Raiders", the binding of his "Valley of Spiders", a short story which, quite apart from the spiders, is a masterpiece in the range of imagery evoked by the simplest verbal means. In his novel "War of the Worlds" the theme recurs. His Martians are close analogues of cuttlefish in their body shape, multiple tentacles, and two large eyes. In working guise they are "a sort of metallic 18Cf. Huckleberry Finn, Ch. 21. "Fearnley.</page><page sequence="16">90 by F. L. WELLS spider". In fighting guise, "They were described as vast spider like machines, nearly a hundred feet high . . ." They feed by se curing a live animal, preferably a human being, and transfusing the blood-supply. The reader may also recall how the cuttlefish theme is used by Victor Hugo and Jules Verne, and the spider theme in 0. W. Holmes' "A Mortal Antipathy". Conan Doyle's "Horror of the Heights" merely moves the cuttlefish into the upper air. It is apparent that the common factors in the nature of these or ganisms have quite special emotion-producing properties. These are examples of how symbols derived and derivable from common little arachnids relate to their nature as disclosed to more objective study. They are stupid, we call them crafty; they are clean and practically harmless, we call them foul and poisonous; they are on the whole our allies, we treat them as enemies. Things are not what they seem; yet the distinction of seeming and being is also less clear than it "seems", and the lives of spiders, like many more things in heaven and earth, can seem to mean such different things that only ignorance is sure of what they "are". A few nights after the above was finished, I went to make casual inspection of a house Epeira (strix perhaps, I am no taxono mist) which had for many weeks maintained in my back yard an isolated existence, never discoverable by day. There she was, busily removing an old web to put in a new one and not merely cutting it away, but chewing it up. From the other extremity there issued a new and better structure. Would that all we who spin fancies (or graphs) might do as much.</page></plain_text>
