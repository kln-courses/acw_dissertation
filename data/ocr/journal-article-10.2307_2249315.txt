M1SS WINTER'S translation will make Kohler's well-known work accessible to a large circle of English readers, and therefore accomplishes a useful object. Prof. Kohler had unusual opportunities for observational aand experimental work on chimpanzees. In 1913 he went out to the An- thropoid Station maintained in semi-tropical conditions at Teneriffe from 1912-1920 by the Prussian Academy of Sciences, where he remained for four years. Altogether he had under his observation nine chimpanzees, eight of whom ranged from 4 to 7 years of age at the time of the majority of the experiments, together with one adult female. As K6hler himself points out, the results might have been different in many respects had he worked with mature animals, or even if one adult male hacd been included among them. The experiments, though very much more extensive than most 25</page><page sequence="2">370 CRITICAL NOTICES: previous studies, are, in the main, of the classic pa-ttern. To quote from page 4 of the translation: "All the experiments . are of one and the same kind: the experimenter sets up a situation in which the direct path to the objective is blocked, but a roundabout way left open. The animal is introduced into this situation, which can, potentially, be wholly surveyed, and so we shall be able to see up to which level of behaviour its capabilities take it, and, par- ticularly, whether it can solve the problem in the possible ' round- about' way." Such tests comprise detour experiments in the literal sense where the longest path proves to be the shortest way to reach the desired goal; experiments where the object can be attained only through the means of some third body or ' implement'. (The latter term, by the way, together with 'imitation,' is objected to by Kohler as a mere clichU which often serves rather to conceal than to elucidate important features of behaviour, see footnote to page 25.) The auxiliary employed may be straws, a rope or a stick used in a variety of different ways, a blanket, a box, even one of four similar doors which when pulled open serves as a point of vantage to the ape once it has climbed to the top, from which it may reach the otherwise unattainable food. Curiously enough an obstacle in the form of a heavy transport box placed so as to prevent the apes from seizing the food until this hindrance had been removed presented more difficulty than did the utilisation of external aids to secure the booty. "The chimpanzee has special difficulty in solving such -problems; he often draws into a situation the strangest and most distant tools, and adopts the most peculiar methods, rather than remove a simple obstacle which could be displaced with perfect ease" (p. 67). Prof. Kohler gives many examples of how the handling of objects appears to be natural to the chimpanzee, a view already very gener- ally held. Frequently sticks and straws are seized and manipulated in a playful manner, but the playful activity is readily directed to a useful end, as in the case of a jumping- or of a tbrowing-stick. Fashions are prevalent in regard to the choice and use of such objects. Considerable ingenuity may be shown by the apes in devis- ing instruments to meet their needs. Thus on one occasion a shoe- scraper was used as a box to reach fruit hanging high overhead; on another occasion an iron bar was wrenched from the same scraper by the chimpanzee, and employed to draw the distant object within reach. Sultan, whose 'intelligence' appeared to be considerably greater than that of the other animals, also placed one cane inside a second of larger diameter, so forming a double-stick of larger dimensions than either single one when occasion demanded. One point arising in all these tests upon which Prof. Kohler lays great stress is the importance of vision, and he states that to under- stand " the capacities and mistakes of chimpanzees in visually given situations is quite impossible without a theory of visual functions, especially of shapes in space " (p. 136). This statement admittedly</page><page sequence="3">WOLFGANG KOHLER, The Mentality of Apes. 371 contains an important truth, but on the whole Kohler seems prone to emphasise it out of its due degree; and here the Gestalt psycho- logist overshadows the careful observer of animals. In this con- nexion Chapter VIII. on the Handling of Forms constitutes an interesting contribution to the subject. But in the frequent state- ments regarding the liability of these apes to " visual confusion," and attributing their apparent inability to solve certain problems to a failure of " optical apprehension " of the situation a certain bias on the part of the experimenter often seems to be evidenced. Thus Kohler himself points out that in many cases the chimpanzees show a remarkable practical perception of space and judgment of size; that Sultan, for example, in making s double-stick never attempted the performance unless the inserted case was clearly less in diameter than the case used as holder (pp. 129-130); and again on page 123 he makes the significant admission that " the low degree of optical apprehension . . . is not necessarily characteristic of chimpanzees, for a certain improvement is possible with them, just as with human children, though in quite a different measure." Considering the visual disabilities of chimpanzees it is remarkable to find that in one respect they appear to possess a relatively highly developed power of visual recognition and discrimination. K6hler in the appendix records some astonishing results obtained with photographs which show that certain apes could distinguish between black and white flat reproductions of a basket full of bananas and the same basket empty, and of a bunch of bananas and a stone similarly shaped and illuminated, and that the discrimination was spontaneous. This is one of the most amazing instances of the recognition of shape by the lower animals that has yet been re- corded, and it is to be regretted that Kohler did not make more extended and controlled observations when he had such valuable material to hand. Indeed, many of his more casual observations and his remarks on social behaviour, individual differences and play of chimpanzees contain much that is of the greatest interest, and a more developed study of certain of these features would probably have yielded even more valuable results than the numerous so-called intelligence tests which he actually carried out. One criticism must be made concerning the experimenter's frequent claim that his presence did not in any way influence his subjects in their attempts to solve the various problems. Since the classic experiments of Pfungst and of various American workers one realises only too well how difficult it is to avoid completely the effects of unwitting influence. And in view of statements such as the following K6hler's work must call forth a critical attitude towards the results: " Incidentally an observation on myself: Even before the chimpanzee has happened on the use of sticks, etc., one expects him to do so-when he is occupied energetically, but, so far, without success, in overcoming the critical distance, anxiety causes one's view of the field of action to suffer a phenomenological change. Long-shaped and movable objects are no longer beheld</page><page sequence="4">372 CRITICAL NOTICES. with strict and static impartiality, but always in a 'vector' as if with a drive towards the critical point" (p. 36). Again Kohler, despite his evident desire to avoid it, falls into the trap which catches most of the observers of animal behaviour and over and over again unblushingly adopts an anthropomorphic position. This, indeed, is marked in some of his most interesting records. The book as a whole is not well arranged and suffers from need- less repetition owing to the plan upon which it is constructed. The important points do not stand out at all clearly, and generally there is a certain lack of proportion. Revision and condensation could greatly improve a subsequent edition. Apart from these faults, most of which are seldom completely escaped by any worker in this field, the book is full of interest and adds considerably to our knowledge of chimpanzees, without radically modifying it. The chimpanzee emerges as a fascinating person, and so far as this work is concerned his likenesses to the human child are more evident than his differences. At the same time it must be admitted that the book is disappointing in that it forms an addition to our knowledge of the repertory of chimpanzees* rather than a real advance in our understanding of their psychology. It is to be regretted that there is no index and that certain minor errors have escaped the proof-reader. E. M. B.</page></plain_text>
