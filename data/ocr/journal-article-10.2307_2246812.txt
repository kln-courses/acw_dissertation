<plain_text><page sequence="1">VI.--CRITICAL NOTICES. The Metaphysics of the School. By THOMAS HARPER, S.J. Vols. I. and II. London: Macmillan, 1879, i881. Pp. lxxx., 592; xxvii., 757. I. In these two volumes Father Harper has given the first instalment of an attempt to resuscitate medieval ontology, and bring it into line with modern science, and to represent these as in harmony and mu- tually supporting and illustrative, to the exclusion of more modern philosophy. The metaphysic of the School and modem science (when modest and on its good behaviour)together furnish a sufficient ra- tionale of the universe, and when Father Harper has completed his ;peace-making exposition;, will have put all other philosophies from the Cartesian downwards out of court. So far as these two volumes go, it might perhaps be said that Father Harper has succeeded after a fashion. But it is very indifferently well, and the science will be found to be put on the "entities" like paint or artificial flowers. The sequel of this Notice, it is hoped, will go some way to justify these remarks. Yet taking the book simply as an exposition of St. Thomas and his orthodox following, and leaving out of count the apologetic, controversial and syncretic parts, it is careful, accurate, lucid, and full almost overfall, and may be regarded as a valuable contribu- tion to the history of philosophy. Certainly, after reading it, one finds other recent accounts of the metaphysic of the School, such as Cousin's, Jourdain's, and Haureau's, meagre and uninforming. The only work that may claim to equal it in merit of exhaustiveness is Kleutgen's Philosophic der Vorzeit, which is not accessible to English readers. F. Harper's work must therefore be welcomed as a decided acquisition, and stands almost, if not quite, unique among English books. Encouraged by finding that "not a few men of information and study in English-speaking countries, even among such as have devoted themselves to physical pursuits, who, tired with the ever-rising Babel of new philosophies and with the universal disintegration of scientific</page><page sequence="2">Critical-Notices. 115 thought that has resulted from what has been called the critical ~method, are looking back with a wistful glance towards the old philo- sophy, but, are puzzled where to look for it," he offers " a course of scholastic philosophy suited to the needs of this 19th century and to the apprelhension of men of culture ". He would rehabilitate Reason which has been coinfounded and disintegrated by Descartes and the brood of seepticisms and idealisms that have proceeded from him. He tells us he eschews " ideological " questions; and so has little to say about Nominalism and Realism, except by the way. Yet he says a good deal for Realism, and assumes more. I In the volumes published, he has treated of " the Definition Qf Me- taphysic," " Being," " the Transcendental Attributes of Being," " the Principles of Being," and the first two of " the Causes of Being "- namely, Material and Formal Cause. Efficient and Final Cause, " the Primary Determinations of Being," the Categories of Aristotle, and Natural Theology are to come. In all this he professes to follow Aquinas strictly; and, while mainly adapting Suarez's order of exposition, he holds to the master and revindicates his doctrine, wherever Suarez deviates in details. The exposition claims to be " elementary and popular," but is really as tough and abstruse and minute a bit of reading as one could find in a long day's walk round a library. While this is said to mark F. Harper's failure to fulfil his promise of "popular" style and treat- ment, it is meant in no disparagement. The result could scarcely be otherwise, where a man fully equipped for his task, earnest and con- scientious, has applied himself to interpret Aquinas, the voluminous doctor. F. Harper at great length defends the technical language of the School against the charge of barbarism, on the plea of necessityand relevance. But in these days such a charge is not likely to be seriously preferred by any who do mnore than play with science or philosophy, and might have been dealt with more lightly. Yet this is only the earliest indi. cation of what proves to be a marked characteristic of F. Harper's treatment of his subject throughout, namely, diffuseness, reiteration, and almost painful elaboration of details. The multiplication of illus- tratiQns sometimes almost blinds us with excess of light. The multi- tudinous links and turns and windings of his chains of proof upon proof sometimes threaten to strangle comprehension and consent. Distinction within distinction, from subtlety to supersubtlety, often leaves little or no impression on the mind but such bewildered ad- miration as one accords to the ingenious artificer of a Chinese-puzzle or the writer of "The Lord's Prayer" within the circle of a three- penny-piece. And while F. Harper has made good in elaborate form his title to use technical terms, this will hardly cover from blame many frequently recurring words and phrases, such as " inamissible," " de- cretorial," "sensile," "absonous," " fautors," "ubication," &amp;c., which give a somewhat quaint archaic and unenglish appearance to his pages. But this was perhaps the natural and unavoidable result of his special discipline and erudition.</page><page sequence="3">116 Critical, Noticeq. In the first chapter there is an exhibition of the nobility and pre, eminence of Metaphysic, ",Queen of Sciences," which reads like thq unfolding of a pedigree by a king-at-arms; and then we are told that it is " the science of real beinc as such," and further that it considers "quiddities" and "essences," 'and does not deal with concrete ex. istents; that it primarily investigates " the Transcendentals," namely, Being, and its three attributes, -Unity, Truth, and Goodness, all which permeate and go beyond the categories; while it specially contem- plates "the nature and properties of pure forms," i.e., "' spiritual substances," "for though," as Aquinas says, "it is the office of a Metaphysician to treat of all realities, in so far as they are includec in the notion of Being, yet it behoves him specially to treat of separated and spiritual entities, because in them is preserved with greater perfectness the idea 'of Being," "as also because their special a-nd particular nature is hidden from us "-whence the doctrine of souls and angels. Again, " it principally treats of Him who is in- finite being, infinite spirit, First Cause". So we may look for a great deal of theosophy in what follows, and accordingly I wish it to be understood that, whenever I have occasion to handle freely the God of the School, I take it that I am not dealing with the infinite object of religion or 'its confessedly provisional ideals, btut with the pseudo-scientific concept of theology, which I find put forward and used as definite and final. Here, then, at the very outset, we have "being-as-such," "essences," " quiddities,' " pure forms " (which yet are " spiritual substances"), "C realities," " spiritual entities," " God," &amp;c., filling up the firmament of thought. And, so far as yet appears, they are brought in and set in view just as if they were objects of direct perception, each separate and complete in itself, and capable of standing alone. "IReal Beingc" at least is taken to be so familiar and well-known an object, as to make us feel it to be almost impertinent to ask what it means for the Angelic Doctor and his interpreter. Nevertheless, we must put the question, and their answer will determine our agreement or disagree- ment with the School notion of a metaphysic. It helps us, to what their meaning is not, to find that " logical beings " such as " second intentions " or forms and laws of thought, and " collective, negative, and privative concepts," are not "real beings "; and the two kinds cannot be subsumed under any higher categ9ry. "'TIhere is nothing which can be univocally predicated of both." Therefore, reality of being is somethinc other than and inde- pendent of presence in consciousness, for that can be univocally predi- cated of both. Here it begins to dawn on us that the metaphysic of the School is a kind of absolutist ointology, and deals with things-in- themselves, and not as phenomena of consciousness, which, in some way not as yet made known, it gets at and -presents to us. Here then the paths divide, and here at the watershed is, as I ihink, the fountain-head of all the errors of the School. They take up " being-as-such " and " essences," as objects given ready-made acnd obviously known. They posit as separate from consciousness and,</page><page sequence="4">Critieal Notices. independent of it, a world of "singular and individual " existents, souls, bodies, &amp;c., without asking themselves what they mean by so doing; and without preliminary search; by way of reflective analytic like Kant's or Renouvier's or Hodgson's, for the manner and pro- cess of the arising of such a world in consciousness, and the secret of its apparent or real detachment. Hence it is in vain that they claim for their metaphysic, as F. Harper does, the prerogative of " architectonic " to the special sciences. It cannot be the universal condition of the sciences; but it may itself be a scieniqe, if it can make good the only position that it is conipetent for it to take up,-that of some kind of organised direct perception. And to do so, it must fall back on its lines of communication, so to speak, on its peculiar psycho- logy, and defend against all comers its intuitive faculty of understand- ing, which is the sixth senise of the schoolmen, and gives them the objects of their special science, viz., "essences " as objects of direct and immediate intuition. To show that I am not misconstruing F. Harper, I shall quote one crucial passage that appears to me to settle the matter definitively: " Real Being may be described, then, as a being which either exists or may exist outsidle of, or beyond, the objective concept of the intellect." Now, by " objective concept," he means that " reality in the object which is covered by our present thoughts." "Thus, an anatomist when he looks at an animal thinks only of its bodily structure. This reality, therefore, in the animal will be his objective concept." But this reality in the animal is not real being, which, as we have just been told, either exists or may exist outside of, or beyond it. Real being, in fact, is sonething more real than this reality, or any other such. It may or does exist apart from the objective concept or con- sciousness-i.e., as other than object of any thought or knowledge. It is Ding-an-sich, but yet somehow the intuitive understanding gets a hold of it for us without destroying its unphenomenal irrelativity ! F. Harper proceeds next to teach us how to know " being-as-such" from " existence ". "As a fact, the reality which is covfered by the formal contept of essence is, in and by itself, really distinct from that other reality which is covered by the formal concept of existence." Observe the in-and-by-itselfness, and also that it is the realities them- selves, and not merely, the concepts of them that are " really distinct ". In other wards, because we can conceptually distinguish in reflection between the statement, that a thing is, and the statement of what a thing is, we are entitled to conclude that existence and essence or nature are absolute realities-each totzum teres atque rotundum, and inidifferent to its relation to any conceiving mind. F. Harper does appearito waver sometimes in his absolutism, and to give a faint promise of the other view, which I hold to be the correct one, that neither " reality," " being," " essence," " existence," nor any thing whatever has name or meaning, but a,s presentment or object of consciousness; yet, on the whole, he keeps consistent with himself and his master, St. Thomas. Thus, on p. 48, Balmez is censured for maintaining that " pure being, in all its abstractness, is inconceivable</page><page sequence="5">118 Critical Notices. without actual being; it is existence itself ". " I-f this be true," says F. Harper, " if the most abstract idea of being necessarily include actual existence, and is identical with it; then, there is no room for the doctrine of possibility, and the Universe is God." The object of the inquiry which leads up to " the doctrine of possi- bility," is " to discover what a merely possible essence is, ontologically and independently of the mode of conceiving it ". To the idea of possibility, " there must be a corresponding reality in the order of things ". So " possible being," too, is dealt with from the dualistic stand-point. Besides possibility implies " power or faculty ". Now, I take it that possibility is not a category of reality, but represents our individual and subjective ignorance and uncertainty about things and events, that are both actual and necessary. In respect of events, it is forward-looking, and represents our ignorance of a future which has no sooner come than we see it to have been necessary and, therefore,. actual. If its cause or the sum of its conditions is present and actual, then the thing that may be, is and cannot but be. If not, it may not and cannot be, and falls under the category of the impossible, which is a real category. If a thing is thought of as possible, then the sum of its conditions is thought of as filled up, and the thing cannot then be thought of but as perceived or existent-and as necessary existence. Prop. 8: "The concept of merely possible being, so far as it is possible and real, is the concept of ' some being or other not possible but existing." Here the School would appear to say the same thing; only it must be remembered that with them existence is always some- thing other than perceivedness. But in this latter phenomenal sense, the proposition appears true. And it might be applied in ;riticism of Mill's " permanent possibilities of sensation," when it will be seen that they must be thought of as actualities, that is to say, as felt or perceived, though not felt or perceived here and now by the individual thinking. But with the School the concept of possible being is not thus resolved into the concept of the existence of the same being, but into " the concept of some being or other," that " in some sort precontains it," and in which it preexists " virtually, eminently or ideally ". " So, the soul of man can vivify and develop the body which it informs; because vegetable and animal life. are eminently contained in the spiritual substance of . the soul ". But further, Prop. 10 teaches that a possible being or essence to be possible must be " logically contained " in some existent, i.e., must be the representation of a mind, " for no efficient cause is perfectly pre- pared and ready for the production of its effect, unless it either knows itself what it is going to do, or at least is under the direction of some superior cause which possesses the necessary knowledge." The anthropomorphism is sufficiently naive here. For the possibility of sausages, a sausage-machine is not enough unless it is conscious, for, if. it is not, a sausagge-maker must be added to ideally precontain them. The way we are now going is inevitable, once we have admitted that. possibility is-an ultimate and adequate category of reality, and not, merely a subjective and provisional way of regarding and classing</page><page sequence="6">Critical Notices. 119 from an abstract and individualistic point of view. Once committed to this pathway of the School, Prop. 14 is irresistible. "Beings are internally possible, forasmuch as they are contained logically and eminently in God; externally possible-, forasmuch as they are con- tained potentially in Him." "The Infinite Mind, contemplating from all eternity his own infinitely, perfect Essence, conceives it as partially imitable in infinite degrees of order and excellence outside himself, should he so will it." Here are at least four unanalysed assumptions -an infinite mind, an infinite essence, an infinite " freewill," and an infinite possibility of outsideness; and all four taken and treated- more scholastico-as separate entities. This deduction or postulation of a supreme artificer or artist was made necessary by mistaking, possi- bility for something more than a negative logical subjective concept. And yet in the end F. Harper is led to admit that " albeit possibles are possibles formally: yet possibles are not possibles fundamentally and in their Exemplar "-thus virtually upsetting the main premiss of his whole argument for " possible being ". And the inconsistency does not take us by surprise, when he says in another part of his book, that " merely possible essence is distinguished from its after existence as not-being from being; and the distinction may be expressed by the formula, Thing is really distinct from no thing ". Next comes " existing being ". Existence is " essence, quiddity, or nature as specifically determined. to actual existence hic et ntunc ". " It stands for a being that really exists outside its proper causes." Is this not palpable tautology, and equal to Existence is existence? If not, it is saved from /this predicament, as elsewhere F. Harper tries to save it, by borrowing the idea of God, ready-made and fully- furnished, from the creed of the Church, and thereupon placing the actuality of essences as distinct from existents, in His mind. Essences or pure forms actually are in Him as his thoughts, and so they are within their " proper cause ". Existents are the same beings outside their proper cause. But it is plainly suicidal for what calls itself a 3netaphysic, and claims to be architectonic and regent of science, to serve, and lean on, any ecclesiastical dogmatic system in this fashion. If it must have its presuppositions, at all events let it not assume them from a source extrinsic and alien to Reason. Let us try another of F. Harper's definitions of " existence ". "The word is abstract and representative of a certain quiddity, by virtue of which things are truly said to exist." But surely this confounds thatness with whatness; and besides gives us two existences -(1) existence (2) existence by virtue of which existence exists- for solution returning us the difficulty doubled. On the same page, there is a second definition. " Existence is the actuiality of being." This again appears lik1e saying the same thing twice over, if not thrice. However, the author evidently means that essence as possible, being made actual by efficient cause, i.e., the freewill of God, is ex- istence. But this will not help one who has displaced " possible being " from being, and is not prepared to take efficient cause and divine freewill for granted. Besides, " cause " and " will " must be</page><page sequence="7">120 Critical N6otices. conceived as existing, and how then can we take one or two existents to explain existence ? The last four hundred pages of Vol. I. are occupied with a very minute and detailed consideration of what are called " the three primary attributes of being in general". These are Unity, Truth, and Goodness. They are transcendental " determinations of being by explicit evolution of entity ". It is to be specially noted that they are not characters of things as felt, known, or thought, but of being-as-such, i.e., of things- in-themselves; else they could have no place in the metaphysic of the School. Transcendental Unity, for instance, is not numerical or quantitative unity. It is not relative to mind attending and counting. Truth is not the more or less approximately permanent consistency of knowledge or- thought with itself. Goodness is not phenomenal ancd relative-the objective aspect of desire, conceived abstractly. But all three transcenidentals are absolute characters of absolute being. Unity is transeendental " indivision," and "the division between Being and its negation is sufficient for the genesis of the 6ssential idea of unity, without any intervention of plurality ". Just as if being and non-being were not fornmally " a many," namely; two ones, in as much as I must have twice attended. There is a very tempting pseudo-Hegelian air about St. Thonmas's production of " one " by means of " naught," and deduction of "' other " fromn " one," and " many from " one " and " other "; but it is really genius misapplied. Under the head of unity there falls to be treated the famous " prin- ciple of individuation ". " Haecceity" is not a name for the mind's act of attending, abstracting, and conceiving-for a relative and provisional act of unification taken statically and objectively; but it Is "the thisness of a thina, that something which constitutes an entity to be individually itself " and one. In fact, it is another thing-in-itself, absolute and irrelative to mind-again the original sin of the School in one of its endless transgressions. One result is, that the Scholastic " individual " is rigid and refuses to change or move, for " if matter quantitatively determined " (by mind) " were the intrinsic constitutive principle of individual inity, it would follow that the same material substance would be all but ceaselessly receiving new individuation, and become a nucleus of individuals indefinitely numerous ". But is not this just what happens ? Hla'VTa pet. There is an ever-changing perceptual continuutm, before it is broken up conceptually and provisionally into a many of ones. Haecceity is -further explained in Prop. 46: "Every material substance, whether complete or incomplete, is the intrinsic constitutive principle of its individuation by its own actual and proper entity." In other words, every individual is individuated by its own individuality. This is not very satisfying, especially as we are hurried on to receive our first introdu'ction to matter-per-se or " primordial matter," as one of these self-individuated individuals, and have the question put to us: "Who, save one who holds that material substahee is itself a mere congeries of sensible accidents, could be found willing to maintain that, if the body of a living man were stripped of its quantity and other accidents)</page><page sequence="8">Critical Aotices. i:I the substantial matter would have no Haecceity or individuation, apart from that of the informing soul? And such an one, if he should chance to exist, will find no place for timself or his opinions in this work." I am sorry to have to confess that this is my plight-or worse, for I am not even acquainted with "the informing, soul". "oModes" form another class of self-constituted individuals. "For instance, the union of my soul to my body is a real individual entity, distinct from my body and distinct from may soul ". Whbn asked to face this new phase or Haecceity, one is driven still further out of court, unless one chances to have about one " the particular reason, a special faculty by which man is enabled to apprehend individual material natures," i.e., haecceities. If not, there is nothing for it but to be content with sensible matter, a mere empty and superficial bundle of accidents, quantities, and qualities-," the effect of the Haecceity, not its cause ". " It is the province of the Intellect alone to contem- plate Natures and Essences." Angels are another kind of self-indivi- duated haecceities, and every angel is privileged to be himself a species ! F. Harper proves it. " Accidents " aggain ' are individual by their own actual entity," and each "has a distinct entity of its own"; so that, e.g., "the quantity in a geranium, and the qualities of red, green, and the like are real entities, entirely distinct from the substan- tial entity of, the plant ". Once more we have the old fallacy of confounding elements only distinguishable in subjective analysis, with separate component parts in direct perception, and of taking conceptual abstracts for perceptual or intuitional concretes. It follows as a matter of course that "God de potentia absoluttd could create (or uphold) the accident without its subject ". " Density," for instance, says St. Thomas. And, indeed, He does so in transubstantiation. After a vain effort to understand these matters that are too h1igh for us, it is some comfort to find St. Thomas and F. Harper deciding that God could not cause whiteness to exist unextended, though Suarez and others of the School are disposed to think otherwise. Under cover of the Master's last dictum, we take leave of Haecceity. The next subject taken up is "Formal and Universal Unity ". When St, Thomas says, "There is nothing really common to many; for what really exists is a singular communicable to one alone. But that which is common is a creation of the intellect,"-he appears to be a conceptualist or nominalist, and of the ordinary modern way of-think- ing about genierals and universals. But here a distinction must be made. He dpes not get them in the ordinary way-by abstraction and generalisation from sensible things or percepts. From sense generalised no true universals can come, but only collective concepts of accidents. " Intellect " penetrates to substance, "c intues material things immaterially," discerns the essence or quiddity and "the unity of the essence "; and that is ." a potential universal ". The "intellect " then abstracts it, takes it out of its accidental setting, and applies it inTdefinitely, and it so becomes a proper full-fledged "universal," in itself as such only ens rationis, but in its ground, an absolute entity. It easily follows that there can be a universal by intuition without</page><page sequence="9">122' Critical Notices. either precedent or subsequent generalisation;- and "the existing similarity of entities to each other, even in their essential notes, is not. necessary to the constitution -of a universal ". A hundred pages are devoted to Truth. About "conceptual truth" there is nothing said that differs much from current views. Consensusb appears to be the criterion of Truth in this sense, for Aquinas, com-' menting on Aristotle's dictum, 'O eyap 7raGi 6SKICE, TOVT' cvai qJa~ev, says, " It is held as a sort of principle, for it is not possible that the natural judgment should err in all mein ". But such sublunary truth has notihing to do with being-as-such and metaphysics. Transcendental Truth, Truth of Being, is " the Being itself as naturally fitted to cause in whatsoever intellect a true estimate of itself ". It is the being as cause of assimilation and conformity to, itself-as having power to make itself intelligible and certainly known. In short, object is taken, as usual, as separate from subject, the known from knowledge, and then a power has to be assumed in the object to bring them together into one. The assumption ceases to be necessary, and Transcendental Truth to have any meaning, when we take them as we find them in reflection, and deal with them as inseparable though contra-distinguished aspects or sides. Even St. Thomas and F. Harper seem to waver and be disposed to take a phenomenal view, when they call a judgment " a real entity"; and a sense-percept " a real being "; unless their use of the words "entity" and " being'" indicate a clinging to the separatist view. Yet carried out strictly to its issues, their admission would lead them to give up things-in-them- selves, and " the science of being-as-such ". But if they do hold on to them, it must be said in their praise that they nobly contend for the perfect conformity of being and thought or knowledge, and generously furnish us with a faculty for reaching their substances, substrates, essences, &amp;c. Prop. 87 affirms that " there can be ontological falsity, properly so called, neither in respect of the divine, nor of the finite, (either speculative or practical) intellect ". In other words, their faith, unlike the despair of some modern abso- lutists, is, that, while the unknown will always extend infinitely beyond the known, still there is and can be no impassable barrier to knowledge, and no ultimate unintelligibility and unknowableness. They do not dogmatically rob mind and science of their endless career. This faith and hope is worthy of all praise, and most opportune. But it can only find its justification in a thorough-going phenomenalism. The last proposition on Truth is a curious one. " Falsity in the judicial act itself is justly attributed to the will." All false judgments are wilful ! Erroneous opinions are therefore more or less blameworthy, and perhaps they ought to be punished ? Intellectual error is of the nature of sin and crime. do the Church philosophy has supported the Church executive in the middle ages, and since. Transcendental Goodness is explained in this way:-Every being, in so far as it has being, has perfection; and this perfection which is one with being, and which causes itself to be desired, and becomes a final cause, and " spreads, communicates, and diffuses itself," is transcen-</page><page sequence="10">Critical Nl!otices. 123- dental goodness. Prop. 100: "Every being as such is good". The proof is poetical: "for those things which as yet have no share in Being, tend towards Being by a sort of natural Desire ;-while those things which have Being already, naturally love that Being, of theirs, and preserve it with all their might :-therefore, Being itself has the nature of Goodness ". There follow two disquisitions on whether " mathematical entities " and ' primordial matter " are good in themselves. The latter is good, and its " form," too, because it naturally desires its form, and its form naturally desires it. As creative of desire in each other, these two beings are good. And if this appears too dramatic a reason, there are, as usual, half-a-dozen others in reserve. Then as Being is Goodness, and Goodness is Being, Evil is nought. But not every non-being, " negation or limitation," is evil; only " pri- vation of due perfection ". Here the idea of ought-to-be is allowed to slip into the argument, ready-made and unaccounted for. Moral evil, for instance, is privative of a due and higher good. As an act of will, sin is positive; but as sin or evil, it is privative, and merely the non-being of that which ought to be. Again, suffering is positive, but is not Evil. Grief and pain are occasioned by evils, but are them- selves positively good, for they are in themselves emotions or feelings which are excellences or perfections of our nature, and in their effects they are good and salutary. Thus defended from objections, and established, the non-being of evil forms the basis of a Theodicy. And what contributes very materially to the superstructure is " this re- vealed truth," that there is no natural or physical evil in the lot of man, for " it is held, according to the tradition of the Faith, that a rational creature could not have incurred any harm either in soul or body or in any things external, save for some previous sin, personal or original ". Freewill has wrought all the mischief. But I cannot see how evil-as-such, i.e., as non-being, can have that or any other " efficient cause "; nor, inasmuch as nothing can neither aim nor be aimed at, how evil can be either " efficient " or " final cause," means or end, of aught. With " Transcendental Goodness " the examination of Vol. I. ends. It has brought out, amongst other things, that the School makes a beginning and effects an illusory appearance of progression by taking abstract products of mental analysis and distinction for separate and. independent concrete objects; objectifies,individualist and provisional points of view, as in the case of "possible being," and then treats them as "entities"; feigns a faculty for discerning those various things-in-themselves, called "the intuitive understanding "; and does not think freely and without prejudice, but moves warily within the rigid limits of a body of foregone conclusions, the Church creed, from which it never scruples to borrow, when distressed for want of a principle of explanation, and to which it is always subservient. Scho]asticism is, in fact, the outcome of an impracticable attempt to serve two masters, Reason and a preternatural revelation. With one eye always on the infallible creed, it suffers constantly from obliquity</page><page sequence="11">124 Critical 'otices. of vision. This will come out into even clearer light, in the critical notice of Vol. II., which is to follow. In it, F. Harper brings the mnetaphysic of the School into more direct contact with modern science and its philosophical implications. It remains to be seen' whether the contact results in collision or coalescence. J. BURNS-GIBSON.</page></plain_text>
