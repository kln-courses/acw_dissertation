Norman, University of Okla homa Press, 1982, xvi + 349 p. Taking his title from an unpublished manuscript attributed to Don Carlos Siguenza y Gongora, El F?nix de Occidente, Professor (Emeritus) Burt Cartwright Brundage explores one of the categories of theological philosophy considered to be discernible in Late Post-Classic Central Mexican beliefs. In the Introduction, these categories are defined as fire (Xiuhteuctli), earth (viewed as a corporate female deity with a plurality of forms and aspects), Tezcatlipoca (whose mephistophean charac teristics are dealt with in chapter VI) and Quetzalcoatl who personifies Prof. Brun dage's last doctrine of the celestial cult. This quadripartite classification of Mesoamerican religion as derived from ethno historic sources, differs from other interpretations of the Post-Classic Mexican theogony which compartmentize it into a number of complexes attributing specific functions to the deities. Quetzalcoatl, and to some extent Tezcatlipoca, resist this type of categorisation since their various forms and attributes enabled them to be included in several cult themes. Quetzalcoatl (quetzal "feather", coatl "snake", literally "Feathered Serpent" in N?huatl) is shown to have several distinct zoomorphic and anthropomorphic manifestations considered to be significant with respect to the god's role as a predo minant sky deity. It is these affiliations which Prof. Brundage examines. Review ing the various forms of zoomorphic creatures, as depicted in Mesoamerican art, that apply to more than one cult complex, Brundage compares them with the dragon portrayed in some Old World forms of ancient and medieval symbolic art. Like those of the last, the Mesoamerican versions are portrayed as composite crea tures, Quetzalcoatl being for example a combination of the Quetzal bird and serpent. Brundage also associates this deity with an amphibaenic form (two headed) and Post-Classic sculpture also shows the god with a plumage of rattle snakes similar to Xochimillo. Such avian and ophidian features are discernible at several Mesoamerican sites, and Brundage extends this draconian sculpture to the Olmec. He thus interprets one piece at La Venta, figured on Monument 19 as depicting a hurricane. It is doubtful however, whether the earlier sculptured reliefs represented Quetzalcoatl or any other Post-Classic deity, and notwithstanding the hypothesis of Michael D. Coe1 and P. D. Joralemon2 it is doubted whether such 1. Michael D. Coe, The Iconography of Middle American Sculpture, New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1973. 2. P. D. Joralemon, A Study of Ommed Iconography.

Brundage proposes that a species of these serpent-form iconographical chime ras originated as cloud volutes associated with Mixcoatl, whose appellation denotes "tornado" or "whirlwind". Spence Lewis3 identified Mixcoatl as the celestial deity of the rude Chichimec, but according to Brundage he is antecedent and generic to Quetzalcoatl. In chapter iv MixcoatFs paternal relationship with Ce Acatl or "One Reed" is affirmed in his form of a dragon or feathered serpent, this being identified as a militarist surrogate of Quetzalcoatl. As early as the Toltec epoch Ce Acatl, in conjunction with Tlahuizcalpanteucli, is said to have represented two aspects of the morning star (Venus). Brundage's propositions concerning the god's celestial import are not explicit in the literature where the emphasis is on a creative function, a role which associated him with Tezcatlipoca, and as Xolotl who has a relationship with the Underworld. This is however not ignored and when reviewing the known myths considered to relate to the sky, Brundage ascribes a creative role to this deity in an anthropomorphic manifestation as Ehecatl Quetzalcoatl. Known as Nine Wind, he brings together the principal features of this surrogate of Quetzalcoatl as a wind deity and supporter of the sky. Ehecatl Quetzalcoatl is distinguished by his buccal mask which Brundage maintains is to be seen in Olmec, Izapan and Maya art in the form of a duckbill. H. B. Nicholson4 however is of the opinion that the buccal mask does not extend beyond the Post-Classic period and affirms Ehecatl Quetzalcoatl in this form is largely confined to Central Mexico, Western Oaxaca and the Gulf coast. The question of whether to regard Quetzalcoatl as an abstract celestial deity or as a configuration of one of his anthropomorphic roles is complicated by his close association with the priest ruler Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl. Brundage recapitulates the main episodes of the narrative concerning this quasi-mythological figure, viewing him as having been a hierarchical and possibly political ruler who exercised his influence to institute reforms of a religious kind in Tollan, particularly with regard to Quetzalcoatl's warrior surrogate Ce Acatl. In doing this, for which he apparently incurred an extreme hostility or unpopularity, he appropriated some of Quetzalcoatl's attributes. The author's discussion concerning Quetzalcoatl is complemented by a study of Tezcatlipoca. Brundage connects the latter with the shaman, this being implied by Tezcatlipoca's association with the scrying mirror. Among his many other forms this deity personifies the night, a realm over which Quetzalcoatl, as the Feathered Serpent regarded as an aspect of Venus, had some control. Though depicted in some myths as a partner, and in others occupying a subsidiary role, Tezcatlipoca shares some of the important functions of Quetzalcoatl. Such a competitive structure surely must have engendered a hostility between the two cultic manifes tations but, as Brundage emphasizes, this is not apparent in the myths. Never theless such opposition may be implicit in Tezcatlipoca's constant interventions and his enemity towards Topiltzin-Quetzalcoatl. Quetzalcoatl is then envisaged as an abstract personification of the sky and of the sky religion. The sky was attributed with various kinds of movement concern ed with cosmical activity including aerial, solar, nocturnal and stellar (the phases 3. Spence Lewis, The Gods of Mexico, London, T.

These engendered a number of quasi-anthropomorphic beings such as Ehecatl Quetzalcoatl, Ce Acatl and Xolotl. As organiser of the ritual calendar, the Tonal phualli (roster of days), Quetzalcoatl acquired a sacerdotal function which initiated the ritualistic observances of the deity's many forms, the personifications of a god conceived in a theriomorphic guise that reflected the features of a celestial cult. The buccal mask and the Huaxtic costume and insignia as illustrated by Brundage as well as standard representation during the period of the Conquest, may well have been the regalia for ceremonial occasions. Prof. Brundage's volume, reinforced by his thorough knowledge of Meso american theogony, presents a unique contribution to the Quetzalcoatl saga that has evolved into a voluminous literature. Though controversial, his propositions reflect an alternative conception of the Central Mexican deity founded upon inter pretations derived from archaeology, a wide scope of iconography, ethnohistoric sources, native codices and the accounts of the Spanish chroniclers. In certain parts, his hypothesis and interpretations are speculative; however it must be taken into consideration that in absence of any shamanistic or priestly elucidation, the accounts of Central Mexican religion upon which Brundage is perforced to depend, have to be evaluated by the merits of the evidence that is available.
