Such combinations are clearly evident in other Chen Mul Modeled censers from Mayapan (Taube 1992: Figs. 63a, 64a, 65a, 66a, 68c; Thompson 1957).

Figs. 23,25). K6020). The Mayapan scribe can also be compared with an anthropo morphic dog and a monkey on Codex Nuttall 77 (Fig. 10).3 Like the scribe, they both have canine features with an elongated snout, fangs, a protruding tongue, and a nose positionedjust above the mouth. The dog is colored blue, like the Mayapan scribe, whereas the monkey has a yellow body and a tail. Al though the Mayapan scribe lacks a tail, the pronounced supraorbital area and brow are similar to the monkey in Co dex Nuttall, reinforc ing the notion that the scribe is pre dominantly simian. The lack of a tail is in accord with imagery of the Classic Maya Monkey-man god (Coe 1978:337). The scribe's sim ian character and flower headdress evoke a link with the central Mexican monkey god associ ated with artisans, an pig 10 Anthropomorphic dog and animal alter-ego of monkey on Codex Nuttall 77 (after Miller Xochipilli, "the '975). prince of flowers." Xochipilli was the principal patron of gaming and arts, including dance, song, music, and the many activities of artisans (Nicholson and Quiñones-Keber 1983:127;Pasztory 1983: 62, 212, 234). Coe (1978:345) notes that Xochipilli's oyohualli ornament is an attribute of the Aztec gods of pleasure and dance that have monkey avatars. Although the scribe lacks the oyohualli pendant, this ornament is seen on w fx Fig. 8. Deity with a numbered scroll resembling a "Number Tree" (after Reents-Budet 1994: Figure 2.19a; Kerr, K6020). iS®^ Fig. 10. Anthropomorphic dog and monkey on Codex Nuttall 77 (after Miller 1975). a Postclassic Maya Howler Monkey God in the Dresden Codex (Fig. 5). With incense billowing out of the attached vessel, the scribe was probably a vibrant focal point in ceremonies de signed to honor the scribes and artists of Mayapan. Mayapan seems to share the Classic Maya concept that the animal most closely linked Fig- 9. Deity on Dresden Codex Witt the at, of writing and S.tSt painting is a Howler Monkey. Villacorta and Villacorta). The complex of simian im agery associated with the Mayapan scribe provides an impor tant bridge between the Classic Maya Monkey-man scribe and Aztec concepts of monkeys as representative of the arts. This common link reflects Maya concepts of natural history and animal behavior. The monkey shares an opposable thumb and great manual dexterity with its human counterpart, mak ing the monkey a natural animal avatar of the royal Maya scribe. Fig. 9. Deity on Dresden Codex 13awearinga mat or net headdress with a flower headband (after Villacorta and Villacorta). Fig. 9. Deity on Dresden Codex 13a wearing a mat or net headdress with a flower headband (after Villacorta and Villacorta). Notes 1. The layered headband flowers may represent white water lilies (Nymphaea mexicana Zuccarini). The five-petaled red flower could be a flower of the Trumpet Vine (Tecoma capensis or Campsis radicans). 2. Karl Taube (1992:63) links the Water Lily serpent to God H and to Quetzalcoatl, the central Mexican serpent god of wind. Quetzalcoatl invented the calendar, according to Central Mexican mythology (Nicholson 2001:31). K'uk'ulkan, generally acknowledged as the Maya counterpart of the feathered serpent, Quetzalcoatl, may also have a similar connection with the calendar (Milbrath 1999:177). 3. Aztec images of canine and simian deities are most often animal manifestations of Quetzalcoatl (Nicholson and Quiñones-Keber 1983:127, Figs. 46, 48; Pasztory 983:Plate 175). The monkey appears as a wind god variant of Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl whereas the dog portrays Xolotl, Quetzalcoatl's twin linked with the Evening Star. Usually these avatars share Quetzalcoatl's costume details, including a spiral shell pendant and earrings. This type of cut shell pendant appears on another Chen Mul Modeled figure, tentatively identified as Quetzalcoatl K'uk'ulkan (Thompson 1957:617, Fig. 3a). Absence of this jewelry on the scribe argues against any direct link with Quetzalcoatl, his dog twin (Xolotl) or the monkey RESUMEN: Durante las excavaciones recientes en Mayapan, Yucatán, arqueólogos mexicanos descubrieron una obra de arte extraordinaria del posclásico que muestra conceptos directamente conectados con la época clásica. Un incensario Chen Muí Modelado (1250/1300-1450) muestra un dios en forma simia, el dios de los escribanos. El escribano carga un tintero en forma de concha de caracol en su izquierda y un pincel en la otra mano. Volutas de vegetación están pintadas con series de números. Este motivo maya esta conocido como el "árbol de números" y aparece también en los códices posclásicos al igual que en la cerámica pintada del periodo clásico. El incensario tal vez fue parte de una ofrenda dedicada a los artistas y escribanos de la Estructura Q58 de Mayapan. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Im Rahmen des archäologischen Projektes in Mayapan haben mexikanische Archäologen ein außergewöhnliches Kunst werk aus der Zeit der Postklassik gefunden das eine deutliche Kontinuität mit Konzepten der Klassischen Maya aufweist. Es handelt sich um einen Chen Mul Modeled-Weihrauchgefäß aus der Zeit um 1250/1300-1450, welches den affengestaltigen Gott in seinem Aspekt als Schreiber-Brüllaffen darstellt. Der Schreiber hält eine aufgeschnittene Muschel als Tintngefäß in seiner linken und einen Pinsel in seiner rechten Hand. Vegetationselemente an seinem Arm sind mit Reihen von Zahlen versehen. Dieses Motiv, das als "Zahlenbaum" bekannt ist, kommt auch in den postklassischen Handschriften und der Gefäßmalerei der Klassik vor. Das Weihrauchgefäß war vermutlich ein Bestandteil eines Opfers zugunsten von Künstlern und Schreibern in Mayapans Struktur Q58.
