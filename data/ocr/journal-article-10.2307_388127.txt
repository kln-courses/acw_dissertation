<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FRENCH REVIEW, Vol. XLV, No. 2, December, 1971 Printed in U.S.A. Jean Giono's Naissance de l'Odyss e by Felix Rysten Naissance de l'Odyssbe (1930), one of Jean Giono's first novels, has escaped the critical notice given to most of his other fiction. Although an earlier investigation has already granted the novel deserved attention,' most studies of Giono's oeuvre decline the work as an early, however suc- cessful, tribute to Homer. The novel is indeed a loving tribute to a favor- ite author, a selective adaptation in which Giono has related the circum- stances that prompted his hero to tell of his adventures. Similarities are certain to exist between Naissance de l'Odyss~e and the Odyssey, but these are restricted to contents. What Giono has done with descriptions of Ulysses' waning days is to insert as small incidents "big scenes" of Homer's epic, or, reversing the process, to extend a small comment in the Odyssey into a major occurrence. Giono brings the reader, after a brief introduction that anticipates Ulysses' return to Ithaca, an insight into his hero's fearful doubts while he wanders back to a not-so-faithful wife and a belligerent son. Not only Penelope and Telemachus are re- duced in their virtuous stature, Ulysses himself as well is taken down from mythical heights to live a more "human" life of deception and survival. He is referred to as a liar by the author, although the reader tends to ob- serve him as a sly man who tells tall tales. While Giono tells what "really" happened in legendary Ithaca, he cajoles the reader into a suspension of disbelief, a tongue-in-cheek reminder of the ancient epic, which creates the comic element in this modern companion piece to the Odyssey. For Giono's purposes it seems appropriate that the regal family should be re- lieved of its superhuman aspects. This is not to say that Ulysses is less than an exceptional individual-he is superior to his environment, if not to his wife and son. Ulysses is aware that for other people man lives as a figment of their imagination. To him this knowledge, this recognized phenomenon, deserves to be exploited. If reality is already once removed from the way it is, what harm is there in creating a world twice removed? By heart a cunning man and a good entertainer by nature, Ulysses real- izes the necessity to deceive the world to create an image of himself that 'Maxwell A.

To his own surprise, and certainly distress, he finds that the fantastic Ulysses which emerges as disguise, is most acceptable to the imagination of others. In a sense the world of Ithaca wills him into existence by ignoring the worn- out man who enters its community. The dullness of the ancient Grecian townships has become overbearing-the people need a hero of mytho- logical proportions to conquer the perverted tedium of their days. Ulys- ses, weary of roaming from isle to isle and from bed to bed, wants peace and respect. Although his motives are understandable, he is not wholly sympathetic: he is an aggressive liar who deserves a distrustful admira- tion within the fictional framework. In this world of deception all existence runs its course free of convenient aid from Olympus. Ulysses must struggle for himself and with himself in a universe devoid of conventional godheads, be they anthropomorphic or transcendent. Giono has preferred to create a world where the presence of the supernatural is manifested in all creation, rather than in a tradi- tional being or man-chosen object. For example, Ulysses maintains that "les dieux ne sont pas sous les tuiles du temple"; instead, "Celui qui a son nom inscrit sur le fronton se soucie peu de la maison bAtie pour lui et, indiff6rent, il 6tire au-dessus du monde son immense corps translucide (I, i, 62).2 In an enchanted, pastoral setting man is part of nature as nature is part of man: both breathe the magic Spirit of Life. The opening lines of Naissance de l'Odyssee introduce this world yet to be born. It is a rising from the dead. Aplati sur le sable humide, Ulysse ouvrit les yeux et vit le ciel.-Rien que le ciel! Sous lui, la chair exsangue de cette terre qui participe encore a la cautele des eaux. La mer perfide hululait doucement: ses molles luvres vertes baisaient sans re- ldche, a f'roces baisers, la dure machoire des roches (11). This introductory description suggests the cosmic confusion of man and the elements, both part of a natural state, yet, at this moment, with man subjected to the treacherous atmosphere of the physical setting. The im- ages create a feeling of an external nature alive to the challenge of sur- vival, evoke an animation that reflects Ulysses' state of mind. In a single despair Ulysses sees but the desolation of the sky. There is no quietude. Not even the beach provides rest: "la chair exsangue de cette terre" col- laborates with the water in a slow destruction of Ithaca's soil. In the flux of nature man has to fluctuate, and from Ulysses' momentary submission to a world beyond his control, he is to rise to prove his mettle as a human 2 The references within the text indicate Part, section, and page number of Jean Giono, Naissance de l'Odyssee (Paris: B.

Ulysses does rise to succeed, but, in the ultimate irony of the book, only because he lives the lie that denies his true existence. It hardly need be reiterated that in Homer's account Ulysses often comes to the fore as a schemer, the power of which is only matched by his physical prowess. In the Odyssey the stories he tells of his past fate all vary widely. However, the perhaps most relevant incident in the Odyssey which appears to have become the theme of this Giono work, is found in Athena's reply to Ulysses after he has told her he is a Cretan. Having lis- tened patiently, she counters: What a cunning knave it would take... to beat you at your tricks! Even a god would be hard put to it. And so my stubborn friend, Odysseus the arch-deceiver, with his craving for intrigue, does not propose even in his own country to drop his sharp practice and the lying tales that he loves from the bottom of his heart. But no more of this: we are both adepts at chicane (XIII). The leitmotiv of Giono's narrative finds its origin in this observation of Ulysses' patron goddess, while it is also at this point in the Odyssey- Ulysses having returned to Ithaca-that Giono begins the novel proper. In its first section Ulysses' initiation begins. It is Archias-who-has- seen-the-gods who opens the rites. His foolish words appeal to Ulysses' "imagination de menteur" and it is this emissary from beyond who for Ulysses "faisait sourdre le monde fantastique qui vit derriere l'air bril- lant" (I, i, 34). Soon comes the day that Ulysses begins to enjoy the pleas- ures of a self-designed, fabulous country, and from then on he cannot help but treat any available audience to the stories of the superhuman pursuits of an imaginary Doppelgdnger. Still, in more sober moments Ulysses knows that divine punishment exists for the partaking of the world beyond Archias' brilliant air. Afraid of the gods he reflects: "J'ai jur6 le nom des dieux .... Jes les ai d6fies par le dard de ma langue." With less of a Homeric and more of a contemporary insight Giono con- cludes that Ulysses "se sentait prisonnier de son mensonge" (I, ii, 71). But it appears that Ulysses has great difficulty in escaping his prison of lies. In order to reach Ithaca and be reunited with Penelope he must stop pretending to be as mighty as the gods. Yet, a desire, an "invisible chucho- teur" follows him, "6numerant A voix basse la tragique litanie des maris egorg6s" (I, iii, 82). Too stubborn to strangle the whisperer of "la f6roce imagination" (I, iii, 85), he eventually brings down upon his head the punishment of the gods whose presence he feels intuitively. Ulysses is walking through a forest when he senses around him, alive in the trees and in the birds, some "grandes frondaisons hostiles" which unfold their revelation. In a flash of self-knowledge its message rustles toward him: "C'est la vengeance des dieux, tu es perdu. Leurs langues ajoutent A ta</page><page sequence="4">GIONO 381 langue, et l'on dira d'immenses gestes, et ceux qui connaissent la gros- seur de tes bras!" (I, iii, 95). With this superstitious and also comic reali- zation, this fear that the divine and human voices shall be mingled to make him, Ulysses, look ludicrous, Giono has modified the invocation to the Muse of Homer's epic. A tradition is made into a vengeance to be appeased which, within a religious context, may well be, Giono suggests, the same thing. As Homer tells us, there was disharmony upon Olympus which pre- vented Ulysses from reaching his home is blessed safety. As a parallel, Part I of Giono's novel ends on a note of doubt and fear. Walking along, Ulysses senses an "inquietude" walking alongside him as a reminder that he has deliberately distorted the truth. The reminder brings about the fear of having to meet Penelope "d6formee par cette ingurgitation d'aven- tures trop grosses pour lui," the fear that she may not be able to face this "h6teroclite amalgame de geants, de deessees charnelles, d'oc6ans bat- tant la dentelle des iles perdues" (I, iii, 101). A fabulous hero has thus been born in the stories of a man who furtively tries to hide his identity, while sensing within him the birth of "les figures de cet extraordinaire periple" (I, iii, 100) until his being is ready to burst asunder with new creations. When Ulysses reappears in Part II, he is suffering the consequences of his lies in confrontation with Penelope. In this regard, however, Ulysses' anxieties are groundless. The day will come soon for him to realize the protection of "les grandes ailes de P6gase" (II, iii, 170) from under which he can hold an audience spell-bound until all are left drunk with images of supernatural realms. Ulysses himself, drunk with pride in having con- quered the islanders as well as his Penelope of the delicate flesh, begins to enjoy his lie, "n6 de sa cervelle, tout arm6, pareil A Pallas n6e de Zeus." As a deity, self-created, he begins to act out his tales in a world designed for private pleasures. In this imaginary setting Ulysses goes forth. "Son ombre le pr6c6dait, fuselee comme une carene," while the earth becomes an ocean where he sails along: "I1 6tait nef, 6quipage, Ulysse! Il vivait son mensonge" (II, vii, 220-21). At this point in the narrative it becomes clear that in one of several as- pects the novel has come full circle. In the opening pages Giono had al- ready sketched Ulysses as a man who, when driving the hogs to the mar- ket, seduced the women along his way with anecdotes. For the fancies of his pre-Trojan days he has now substituted more lasting pleasures of the imagination, a self-induced trance which thrives on images of bound- less seas and which thereby transcends the limited forms of the earth. Once Ulysses had "escaped" Circe's island to reach his own rocky shore,</page><page sequence="5">382 FRENCH REVIEW he entered the physical setting of a sensuous landscape. Its road, "comme une trace de couleuvre, deroulait ses anneaux au milieu de l'oseraie." It is this snake-like, circular trail that has led him through a swaying cur- tain of rushes to a plain which "mimait la chair liquide de la mer" (I, i, 31). Yet, when Ulysses' journey continues, he is abandoned to travel across a hostile earth, enveloped by "la voix cruelle de la terre" (I, ii, 70), before he reaches, at the end of the first Part of the novel, the sensuous sea. "Il vint A elle," Giono exults, "comme sur une amie d6sir6e" (I, iii, 102). It is not until Ulysses has passed toward reconciliation with Penelope and the people of the nearby town-and having valiantly withstood his doubts-that he can return to his eternal friend. This friend of old has grown mellow and placid, having become "un grand bassin plat A peau mordoree" (II, vii, 222). Its russet, restful qualities and narrow propor- tions accommodate Ulysses' newly-found world of make-believe, a world from which violence should be excluded as a disrupting element. By hav- ing limited his world to better fill it with power, Ulysses has become the deity of his own creation. Holding a toy ship which he has just sailed on the pond through Scylla and Charibdis, Ulysses la gardait au creux de sa paume comme un de ces dieux de pierre debout sur le fronton des temples, et qui portent dans la nacelle de leurs mains jointes le sym- bole materiel de leur puissance (II, vii, 229). New stories come rising to the surface to celebrate the birth of a deity. But at this moment of ecstasy a disquieting reality suddenly intrudes: Ulysses overhears a savage song that sings of blood and death. Nearing its conclusion, Naissance de l'Odyssee moves back to its beginning. Giono skillfully suggests with the last word of the novel the one that began it, aplati. The hero glimpses behind the dense foliage that protects the pond his angry and spiteful son. Telemachus, with wet hair matted like a hel- met, is-so ends the final sentence-sharpening "un 6pieu en bois de platane" (II, vii, 230). With the word platane Giono has recalled aplati, and in so doing so has once more "flattened" his hero.3 Although the men- acing intrusion upon an idyllic scene of a grown child at play is un- expected, it may convey Giono's view that the perpetual bliss of an enchanted world can too readily be destroyed by hate and resentment. However, in order to provide a point of stability for Ulysses, Giono has created a Penelope so affectionately that it is difficult to miss his prefer- ence for the woman of the narrative. In the Odyssey it is said of Penelope that she has an excellent brain and 3 It may be noted here that the choice of the plane tree has, in all likelihood, been a de- liberate one; aplatir and platane have the same Greek root, platys (Latin plat (t) us), signi- fying "flat" or "broad" in the sense of flat.</page><page sequence="6">GIONO 383 a genius for getting her way (II). It is this combination of qualities, to- gether with a casual negligence, which Giono has selected to portray an idle, but not unsympathetic woman. For Homer she bore a resemblance to the spider-that-was-Arachne, endlessly weaving and thus repeating the truth of death; for Giono she is a latter-day Ariadne who provides more than one thread in the maze of her husband's doubts to lead him astray in his search for the monster of inquietude. Introducing her through the same gossip Ulysses overhears, the reader meets her at last in the second Part of the novel. Getting out of bed, she recalls in angry disdain a recital about a man named Ulysses who held the world in his hand and wore a garland of goddesses clinging to his head. However, her recollec- tion of how she seduced her present lover, Antinous, improves her mood. First puzzled, then in doubt, she becomes worried when her reeking swineherd brings with his stench the news of her husband's arrival in Ithaca. She decides that it has become imperative to raise without delay "le decor d'une Penelope menagere et sage" (II, i, 121). As the hours pass she becomes more distressed at the prospect of meeting her husband of old, this man who has assumed, as the bards tell it, cosmic proportions. The phantoms and images of his sung past have grown into a great shadow which is man, earth, and sea-a shadow which enacts before Penelope's eyes "sa grande vie irreelle" (II, ii, 137). Presuming that the gods will have informed her husband of her actions but knowing that their words are "toujours embrouillee(s)," she plans to imitate her husband's way by counteracting the truth until he loses "le fil de la verit'" (II, ii, 140-41). When they do meet, they perform their initial encounter in the manner that Homer describes it: quietly they observe each other, each too per- plexed to make a first move (XXIII). When they come face to face again, Penelope awaits him, robed and scented, to take the initiative. "Ce n'est pas ta faute, je le sais," she remarks; "I know, I who used to wait long nights on the cliffs, crying like a fountain." Ulysses justifies his absence by blaming the goddesses, but then remembers the gossip first heard from Menelaus. When he begins the accusation, she calls upon Aphro- dite to assist her and explains the gossip away as divine vengeance for having resisted in her chambers a god with "la grace du cygne" (II, v, 189). At last Eros descends upon them for Ulysses to receive "vaillam- ment l'assaut du bonheur" (II, v, 189). The use of the word assaut is interesting here in that it recalls Ulysses' valiant "resistance" of the lusty wenches that were transfigured into goddesses by his frightened imagina- tion, while it anticipates the conclusion of the novel. Although all is well now between husband and wife, their son, born of innocent days, remains hostile. He went his labyrinthine ways, in vain looking for his father. Having gained a taste for roaming, he now reap-</page><page sequence="7">384 FRENCH REVIEW pears at home, a slightly ridiculous figure, a blustering blockhead who covers up his disappointments with crude behavior. After grumpy silence Telemachus, at last, begins to tell his adventures; but since his audience finds the matter in which he relates most disagreeable, they soon grow annoyed with his "recits veritables" (II, vi, 211). Apparently, true stories are not desired by Ulysses and Penelope who both prefer subterfuge; equally unappreciative is their dinner guest who, interrupting Telemachus, turns to his host: "Maitre Ulysse, changez-nous un peu de ces jeux de cervelle: j'ai besoin d'&amp;couter quelque chose qui sente sa realite (II, vi, 217). The truth as presented by honest Telemachus obviously does not fare so well, because it interferes with Ulysses' fantasies. Also, every physical reality which does not fit into Ulysses' newly-envisioned realm of eupho- ria must be removed; therefore, the most intrusive element, Antinous, Penelope's lover, is singled out as the embodiment of disruption. Men- tally Antinous is no match for Ulysses. Enjoying the favors of an older wo- man, he remains with her out of lazy and flattered habit. He is no match for Penelope either who, even in her anxiety, can plan a most reasonable course to underplay her wayward behavior. Eventually, the three mem- bers of this domestic comedy meet. Ulysses is entering the banquet hall, a beggar "avec la complaisance d'un cochon que l'on va egorger" (II, iii, 163); Antinous finds reassurance by overindulging in food and drink; Penelope acts the gentle widow. For audience they have a hog trader who provokes a fight between the beggar and the lover. When both are too scared to begin, the trader pushes Ulysses who stumbles and in his fall hits Antinous with his fist. The terrified lover flees. Prompted by the trader, Ulysses sets off after him to become the victor when Antinous falls in a landslide of the cliffs. The next day his broken body is brought on shore and the dead boy's mother arrives. Then, suddenly, the tone of the narrative changes. Giono now turns to a restrained description of the macabre that matches Homer's accounts of terrible woe by evoking the horror of a mother's incomprehending grief. She arrives in silence, as if escaped from Hades; she begins to wail when she touches the lifeless body; at last she howls "comme une chienne blessee." That night the mother gets up and tries to move the corpse but, unsuccessful until the end, she has to leave at last. It is this occurrence, as well as Antinous' mysterious death, Giono suggests, that brought him into the Odyssey as an important figure. The cruelly duped victim "resta sur le visage d'Ithaque comme la marque d'un coup de poing" (II, v, 197-201). It is not only the mother of Antinous who is as if from unknown worlds, or as Giono suggests, "Hades," Ulysses also knows a world-beyond, a world without Shades but filled with divine incarnations that confront the</page><page sequence="8">GIONO 385 hero with and within his imagination. Lost in a forest, Ulysses comes upon a deserted temple where he hears "mille cithares chantant ensemble un chant fun bre." He tries to drink, but the fountain is dead. He waits for a sign from the stone gods, but they are covered with clinging vegetation. Then, he suddenly finds a closed mirror with a likeness of Pallas on the cover. Opening it he sees his own face: "cireux, deforme comme celui des morts couches sous l'paisseur de la terre." Unable to escape to the plains, Ulysses touches in the silence "le mystere des mille corps divins en chasse autour des hommes." He watches a viscous world where the trees look like algae on the bottom of the water. The wind brings sounds of Pan to scare the liar, the temple begins to move, while its bas-reliefs throw off the foam from which a goddess is born-the goddess he once seduced on the bed of the sea (I, ii, 74-79). These god-haunted visions recur. Ulysses discovers in his soul unknown countries inhabited by al- legorical or mythical figures who either come to reclaim the phantom of his imagination or arrive to clamor for recognition-one is never quite sure. He is attacked by the horrible monsters of the realm of sleep, and is made to pay with fear for having become initiated into the divine right of knowing the lands beyond Ithaca "dont on dit merveille mais que personne n'a vues" (I, iii, 98). The gods that appear in Ulysses' nightmare not only roam his subcon- scious, they fill all of the hero's world. Whenever evening falls in the countryside, the minor deities of wood and field make their furtive en- trance. Nature comes alive: the mountains growl, the sky bears a flight of vengeance, and the earth speaks with cruel voices. Ulysses panics. Fearing revenge for his blasphemous lies, he flees through the forest re- flecting that he has been waylaid by the anger of "Pan silencieux" which will bring encounters with fauns, centaurs, and nymphs (I, ii, 76). Still, there is no escape because Pan is of this earth; moreover, he is the earth.4 At one point, Giono, illustrating his hero's fearful discomfort, even makes Pan omnipresent: "Ses longs bras etaient des fleurs enlacants, son corps, de roche et de terre petri, bossele de montagnes, fumait et chantait dans le vent. Il parlait comme une forit" (I, iii, 99). Giono is fond of such de- scriptions of tangible realities; yet, he also lovingly speculates on the un- known forces of nature as created within man's superstitions. A malevo- lent use of the supernatural-later offset by a redeeming one-is made in the passages that describe Ulysses' hunt of Penelope's lover. Fleeing, Antinous feels the wingbeat of the gods around him, sees Ulysses as a divine manifestation, and realizes, while drowning, that this time, "c'&amp;tait 4 For interesting discussions of Giono's use of the Pan concept see Pierre de Boisdeffre, Giono (Paris: Gallimard, 1965), pp. 46-61; Claudine Chonez, Giono par lui-m&amp;me (Paris: Ed. du Seuil, 1964), pp. 35-57.</page><page sequence="9">386 FRENCH REVIEW bien le coup assene par les dieux" (II, iv, 175-81). In Ithaca when the news of this event is heard and the corpse brought ashore, the angry speculations begin. The people sail out to the scene of the disaster, and report to have observed "la marque d'un 'norme pied." Certainly the gods have aided Ulysses; have they decided to abet the avenger (II, v, 195-200)? The town remains distressed until one day a miraculous re- demption occurs: a fountain which did not flow for a hundred moons, begins to stream again. One sees in this rebirth the hand of the gods, the powers of Ulysses. All is now forgiven, and Ulysses, glad of the omen, rushes into town to entertain the people with carefully contrived tales: "Je vous dirai comment je me ddlivrai du Cyclope. C'est risible, vous verrez!" (II, vi, 205). And so the Odyssey is born. For this privilege to bring joy, Ulysses has been aided by the gods, or, more specifically, by another divinely-chosen mortal. Archias had already intimated to Ulysses the mysteries of the Other Region; the fruition of this knowledge is brought about by a special emissary from Olympic heights. Then, at an inn, amid bawdy and superstitious peasants, Ulysses shares company with a blind guitarist whose heightened perceptions take on a prophetic character-prophetic, because he will precede Ulysses to sing of the arrival of a mythological hero whose superhuman powers can change the course of events. This minstrel is of an unearthly appearance: his body is like a god's; he plays a music in which the men of the forest can discover "le visage de leur reve." This music is pure, because it dies at the sound of slander, the mentioning of adultery. He claims to have once seen the sinking of Ulysses' ship and thus its captain too has de- scended to the bottom of the sea. Perhaps this is the wrong conclusion, the guitarist admits, but he cannot help but sense something divine in the sudden disappearance of a man who went up in foam. When Ulysses explains his case in the third person-creating the first tale-the guitarist observes that "ta phrase est comme un amandier charge de gui. Elle veut dire autre chose qu'elle ne dit" (I, i, 39-65). The next morning the minstrel leaves for the city and prepares the way for Ulysses. He will bring a mood which both anticipates and apprehends the arrival of this hero of the fabulous; he will create une coquille which Ulysses will have to fill in Ithaca. At first the trial of fulfillment seems beyond Ulysses' abilities; but since the song "Ulysse ou le beau periple" can deliver those that resemble the dead, asleep under the yoke of physical intoxication (I, iii, 97), Ulysses comes to realize that people are ready to accept him as a new-born myth, as well as its own advocate. When the novel ends, Ulysses has perfected his craft: he had shed "de gui," the choking vine from his almond tree of creation. In a real sense it can also be said of Ulysses that he has become the</page><page sequence="10">GIONO 387 healer of minds grown apart from nature, a healer of the spirit in man dulled with labor and monotony. His success has depended, as Giono implies, upon the mythological enlargement of his human personality which has never lost touch with the natural world of the senses. With en- chanted disrespect Giono has spoofed a hallowed epic without turning his vagabond hero into a subject of ridicule. The mockery never obscures Giono's love for his principal character who set out to seize the world and who, in intense cosmic communion, gathered each day for better or for worse. With imagination victorious, but never so triumphant that the reality of the natural sense impression is shut out, Giono concludes with Ulysses that the secret of their happiness lies in communion with sand and water, with flower and tree, with the land which partakes of the Woman, with the earth which has become Penelope, "comme son corps transmue, son 6manation, la coquille chantante et mordoree..." (II, vii, 219-220). She has the russet color of the pond, Ulysses' microcosmic world which, in ultimate transfiguration, is about to become the perilous sea that brought him home to Ithaca.
