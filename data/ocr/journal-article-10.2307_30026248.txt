Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1999. xv + 208 pages. $39.50 (cloth). All too rarely do books live up to the praise found in their jacket blurbs. This book is an exception. It does provide, as Christopher Achen suggests, "a powerfully unified and coherent perspective on a vast literature" concerning collective choice theory. Likewise, Gary Cox correctly observes that the authors "lay bare the conceptual foundations of the study of collective preferences, linking key results to both practical and theoretical issues in the study of politics." For serious students, the balance drawn between broad discussion and technical development is nearly perfect. With the prerequisite of some minimal tools - calculus, a little set theory, a feeling for Edgeworth- box style analyses - and a willingness to follow extended mathematical arguments, the reader is guided from very basic definitions concerning individual preferences to complex discussions of the genericity of empty cores in spatial settings. Without sacrificing rigor and in a development that is nearly self-contained, the authors maintain a fairly leisurely pace, pausing for verbal summaries of the technical material and numerous numerical examples (the U.N. Security Council being one of their particular favorites). They even lengthen some of the proofs to make them more accessible. In short, Austen-Smith and Banks artfully steer between two extremes often exhibited by formal theory texts: straight-ahead grinding through theorems and proofs and very intuitive description that leaves the student unprepared for the scholarly literature. Finally, there are exercises of varying</page><page sequence="2">387 difficulty and specific discussion sections shedding light on deeper issues of interpretation and application. What exactly does the book cover? It begins with individual preference and necessary or sufficient conditions for it to be rationalizable. It then pro- ceeds to the aggregation of these preferences, starting with the classic Arrow impossibility result but also developing the same finding through the more comprehensive structure of decisive sets and filters. The authors emphasize the pervasiveness of the implied tradeoff between collective rationality and democracy: rationality is purchased by concentrating political power. Next on the agenda are ways to preclude the applicability of the impossibility results. One chapter takes up restrictions on outcomes, including a very clear dis- cussion of the Nakamura number and its application to various voting rules. Another chapter considers restrictions on preferences. The most famous of these is single peakedness, but another that receives considerable attention is the ordering of preferences so that, roughly speaking, the preferences of all individuals on one side of a cutpoint differ in the relevant way from those on the other side. Since preferences concerning the distribution of wealth or income often reasonably satisfy this restriction, it has very important uses in political economy. The political economy literature, however, frequently formulates this restriction in terms of a "Single Crossing Property," which Austen-Smith and Banks only briefly mention in a "Further Reading" section. To this point, they have considered situations in which the set of altern- atives is finite. They now expand their discussion to the case of uncountable alternatives and, accordingly, introduce spatial theory and the accompanying idea of utility functions. The authors usefully stress that the largely negative results they present concerning the existence of the core in the context of distributive politics are not due to any assumed individual selfishness. Al- truism is less helpful in formal political theory than in political life. Next, Austen-Smith and Banks clearly and carefully present more of the intrinsic- ally difficult material on the core and the associated "chaos theorems." Here they emphasize that "chaos" is a characteristic of the formal spatial structure and does not imply chaos in actual politics. By the same token, they argue in their concluding chapter that one should not be misled by the relative presence of Nash equilibria in game theory, the subject of Volume II, to conclude that somehow there is a way to dodge the implications of the impossibility and chaos results. The tradeoff between democracy and rationality is unavoidable. Still, the contrast with game theory does raise the issue of how collective choice theory is to be applied empirically, which ultimately must be at the heart of any positive political theory. Austen-Smith and Banks correctly sug- gest that, by whatever name, something like collective rationality must apply to political choices if there is to be any sense to collective decision at all.</page><page sequence="3">388 In this respect, "rationality" is just another term for the idea that, based on the preferences of the individual participants and the rules under which they participate, preference aggregation produces a determinate decision or set of decisions that succeeds against whatever was not chosen. But if this is what collective rationality means, it is also true that Arrow's specific restrictions on aggregation rules constitute an inappropriate empirical model of democracy, which often does produce determinate outcomes. Put another way, collective choice theory tells us that what we are pleased to call democracy cannot pos- sibly satisfy the Arrow conditions, however normatively reasonable they may be. In combination, then, Arrow's conditions define a misspecified model of democratic politics. In this respect, the original Buchanan and Tullock complaint against Ar- row is off the mark. Arrow's problem is not that he transfers the notion of individual rationality to collectivities, the anthropomorphic terminology notwithstanding. His problem is the conditions he establishes for producing a rational choice. Or stated more accurately, since Arrow's own concern is normative, this is collective choice theory's problem. Thus despite the sem- inal role and historical centrality of Arrow's work and its profound normative implications, there is something odd about using it as the launching point for an empirical analysis in which the United States and, say, Iraq are both examples of democratic failure. Positive theory needs more positive results. The final chapter of the book notwithstanding, if game theory can yield equi- libria that provide insight into political behavior and institutions, why should positive theorists anguish over the sacrifice of certain aggregation rules if the anguish is normatively motivated? Arrow's results and similar findings have, of course, considerable heur- istic value. Inspired by his theorem and others, scholars have learned to be attentive to the role of agenda setters, the strategic manipulation of voting outcomes, and institutionalized techniques for avoiding preference cycles. Yet while this book is dedicated to positive political theory and, accordingly, to providing the foundation for these kinds of investigations, much of it winds up presenting what might be called negative political theory with its many knife-edge results and chaos theorems. The strictly positive implications of the collective choice theory developed so well in this book remain very gen- eral to say the least, and the gap between work that was essentially normative in origin and its empirical application - the gap between formal structural chaos and actual political order for example - remains uncomfortably wide. Consider a point on which Austen-Smith and Banks are particularly, if characteristically, insightful. One of Arrow's conditions, Independence of Ir- relevant Alternatives (IIA), says roughly that a collective preference between two alternatives should only depend on the alternatives being compared. This</page><page sequence="4">389 condition has been particularly controversial (although, given Arrow's res- ults, some scholars have simply been looking for something to pick on). For one thing, IIA precludes interpersonal comparisons of utility. For another, many of its critics believe that the "context" of a preference can legitimately matter, and they have produced ample illustrations to show why. Austen- Smith and Banks cut through this debate with a telling observation. These ostensible counterexamples to IIA depend on an under-specification of the alternatives in the original collective choice domain. For once the impact of context is recognized through a more refined description of the alternatives, the problem dissolves. If the alternatives are correctly specified, they are mu- tually exclusive; yet if they are mutually exclusive, how could decisions be influenced by alternatives that are not being compared? More broadly, John Broome (1990: 138-141) has argued that any appar- ent violation of the individual rationality assumption that one might observe experimentally or otherwise can be similarly countered by refining the al- temrnatives the actor is assumed to be facing. Yet Broome is nonetheless concerned about the potential empirical vacuity of this remedy, which is also Mark Machina's (1989: 1660-1663) assessment of this defense against his criticisms of expected utility theory. This problem suggests that the formal defense of IIA presented by Austen-Smith and Banks does not fully close the gap between the structure of Arrow's theorem in its ideal form and its em- pirical application. This is particularly noteworthy since, as indicated above, the application of Arrow's result can be blocked by restrictions on the relative number of outcomes, whereas the refinements I have been discussing can only increase the number of outcomes. These qualms about empirical collective choice theory do not in any way detract from this book's very considerable technical and expository accomplishments. Nevertheless, I have a few relatively minor corrections to register in this area as well, since any student truly attempting to learn this material from the ground up may be unnecessarily hindered by even slightly imprecise formulations. For example, the set of nonempty subsets S of X is defined in the text as {S: S e 2x\{0}}. The correct definition is {S: S E 2x\O}: 0, which is a subset of all sets, is itself a set, whereas {0} is the set whose single member is the null set, which is a different object. More important, an aggregation rule is said in the text to be weakly Paretian if for every preference profile, every pair of alternatives x and y, and for all individuals i, xPiy implies xPy, where Pi is individual i's preference and P is collective preference. Strictly speaking, however, the definition should read: xPiy for all i implies xPy. The original statement defines what one might call unilateralism rather than unanimous consent. On the other hand, the book is generally free of the annoying typos that plague some formal texts, although</page><page sequence="5">390 to conclude my review of a truly great book with one last carping complaint, the word 'principle' is a noun, not an adjective.
