<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON CAUSATION AND RESPONSIBILITY IN ENGLISH LAW Lord Wright * That eminent Law Lord, Lord Asquith, now, alas, no longer with us, was somewhat apologetic in comparing legal doctrines of Causation with those as he saw them of science and philosophy. I venture to question if there is any occasion for apology. The different sciences have developed in their own many ways in their efforts to satisfy the needs of human thought which have called them into life; this is particularly true of their treatment of what is called the relation of cause and effect. Lord Asquith truly said that " the philosophie doctrine of causation and the juridical doctrine of responsibility for the consequences of a negligent act diverge." They are dealing with different problems and the solu¬ tions must differ. Certainly the solutions or explanations pro- pounded by philosophers, scientists and lawyers are different from what is after all a relative and empirical problem. Law in particular has no reason to blush for the results of its age-long efforts. It is difficult to state precisely and comprehensively the legal notion of Causation. The idea is clearly a necessity too of human thought; it has been shaped to meet its requirements. Its nature for legal purposes can be traced pragmatically by analysing the different judgments in which it has been dealt with from time to time. Since Hume's famous pronouncement that the root idea of Causation is to be found in the constant conjunction of cause and effect, it has been recognised that we were not dealing with an eternal verity, but an experimental generalisation. People were and are still puzzled to explain how causes produce effects, as they are to explain how mind acts on matter. Many similes have been invented, such as that of the " chain " of causation (which a sceptic said must consist of missing links) or a network, or strings and many other like picturesque expressions which are thought to help to make the idea intelligible. But that effects follow causes is one of the necessary postulates of human thought, however expressed. It is a necessary part of our experience which we inherit and develop each in our own way from our earliest years. It enables us * p.c., g.c.m.g., Honorary Fellow of Trinity College. 163</page><page sequence="2">164 The Cambridge Law Journal [1955] to adjust our actions and purposes on the footing of the uniformity of nature, however crudely conceived. In its more subtle develop¬ ments science and technology all proceed on the basis that effects follow causes in moulding the future, though modern thought may want a new terminology. Lord Russell (a thinker eminent in both mathematics and philosophy) published in 1918 a collection of Essays called Mysticism and Logic which included a chapter on the "Notion of Cause." Though thought has changed a great deal since then I can quote the Essay because the book was reissued in 1953. Lord Russell is somewhat critical; he says (p. 171) that " the word causal is so inextricably bound up with misleading associations as to make its complete exclusion from the philosophical vocabulary desirable"; he adds "it is desirable to inquire what principle if any is employed by science in place of the supposed * law of causality' which philosophers imagine to be employed." The whole essay which I cannot quote adequately should be studied by lawyers when they feel tempted to assimilate the ideas which they use to those of philosophers and scientists. In truth it seems to me that such comparisons can only mislead. It is true that in legal inquiries, which depend on understanding sufficiently for their purpose an actual, physical, mental or moral event it is often necessary to describe as cause and effect, as if they were, as perhaps they are in a sense, actual £equences. The ordinary man's thought and language would so require. But beyond the actual happenings, the lawyer would look for a further element, what Lord Asquith called " the juridical doctrine of responsibility." I think it would be well for the lawyer to forget about philosophical doctrine of cause and effect, at best a shifting sand, as Lord Russell gives warning, and attempt to concentrate his attention on the action of causality as it works.in the ordinary affairs of the life of the law. He will observe what Hume described in a memorable and often quoted passage, that a new element introduces itself in legal sentences, the element of "the ought," of legal duty and responsibility. That is a new idea to be contrasted with statements of fact. At once it becomes apparent that legal thought has a language and logic of its own and a method which looks at its chosen end, the determination of responsibility. The approach to Causa¬ tion is from that angle. Responsibility involves a reasoned judg¬ ment such as is now often called a value judgment. The root idea then is the idea of the " ought," it must be " right," i.e., based on true appreciation of moral theory. It is thus distinguished from judgment of fact. Some modern jurists have claimed to exclude value judgments</page><page sequence="3">C.L.J. Causation and Responsibility in English Law 165 from the category of legal judgments, as being merely subjective and unworthy to rank with judgments of fact. No doubt judg¬ ments of fact have a great role to play in every legal system especially an empirical system like the Common Law. But the strictly legal judgments must be value judgments, because they give effect to the idea of the " ought" in the relevant application. The mere statement of fact is not a legal judgment; it has no legal effect to say that one event caused another, when indeed the relation of cause and effect is purely factual and empirical and is a proposition of fact, not of law. I here disregard any purely a priori deductions such as some mathematical propositions. But the common law legal system contains as a necessary and integral part of its content, value judgments. While the judgment that an event has been caused by another particular event is not a value judgment and not a legal judgment, but a judgment of fact, it becomes a legal judgment if the facts are subsumed under some legal principle of value, of right and wrong, and the moral issues of responsibility can be applied. Lord Sumner in British Columbia Co. v. Loach [1916] 1 A.C. 719, made some important observations not always kept in mind. It was a personal injury case, in which the issue was what killed the man whose death was the subject of the action, whether it was his own fault so that his negligence was the sole cause of the accident. In that latter event the plaintiff would have no cause of action according to established law. Lord Sumner said " The question is not one of desert, or the lack of it, but of the cause legally responsible for the injury . . . The inquiry is a judicial inquiry . . . The object of the inquiry is to fix respon¬ sibility for the wrongful act which has caused the damage. It is in search not merely of a causal agency but of the respon¬ sible agent. . . . Till that has been done there may be a considerable sequence of physical events and even of acts of respon¬ sible human beings, between the damage done and the conduct which is tortious, and is its cause. It is surprising how many epithets eminent judges have applied to the cause, which has to be ascertained for this judicial purpose of ascertaining liability, and how many more to other acts and incidents, which for this purpose are not cause at all." Lord Sumner then proceeds to give a long list of such epithets, such as efficient or effective cause, real cause, proximate cause, direct cause, decisive cause, immediate cause, causa causans on the one hand, as against on the other causa sine qua non, occasional cause, remote cause, contributory cause, inducing cause, condition and so on. " No doubt," he adds, " in the particular cases in which they occur they were thought to be useful or they would not have been used, but</page><page sequence="4">166 The Cambridge Law Journal [1955] the repetition of terms without examination in other cases has often led to confusion and it might be better, after pointing out that the inquiry is an investigation into responsibility, to be content with speaking of the cause of the injury simply and without qualification." It may be noticed that as a matter of words it has become common in judgments to speak of the " the cause " (" the " often being italicised) as in contradistinction to "a" cause or causes; the latter term is often used to indicate a compiex of conditions, or circumstances previous, subsequent or concurrent, which have led to the casuality or event. Hence the common law was concerned to find what was the sole cause, the single cause which in a just reckoning precipitated the event—the sole cause in which the various preliminary or accessorial, inducing agencies were merged. A good early instance may be found in Radley v. L. 8c N. W. Ry. (1876) 1 A.C. 754, where the House of Lords relegated to a subordinate position what had appeared to the Exchequer Chamber to be contributory negligence. I think Lord Sumner was right in distinguishing causation from responsibility. Causation is a matter of fact, responsibility is a matter of legal decision; it is a value judgment as I have already explained. It may be a matter of some difficulty in some cases to single out, from the compiex of inducing agencies, what is the cause to which must be attributed decisive potency. This may involve both fact and law and must depend on a wise survey of all the circumstances of the case. It thus to some extent bears a resemblance to negligence, which may for some purposes be defined as to consist in absence of due care in all the circumstances. Lord Reid has recently in a passage T shall later quote drawn attention to the particular character of the choice of the cause in particular cases. In CaswelVs case I ventured to observe that the law has disregarded as contributory causes some acts of the plaintiff which might be regarded as in a sense negligence and treated them as of subsidiary moment in ascertaining the causation of the injury and has fixed attention on what was judged to be the dominant cause. Hence the question was stated, as it was in Swadling v. Cooper [1931] A.C. 1, to be what was the substantial cause. According to Lord Sumner it would be enough to ask what was " the " cause. When it is seen what the law means by " the cause " the difficulty of the selection becomes much less serious. The idea of the single cause is not peculiar to law. It is a deep-seated instinct of the human understanding and in practical life is being constantly put into effect, almost as a matter of course. Like negligence, the practice cannot be reduced to a hard and fast</page><page sequence="5">C.L.J. Causation and Responsibility in English Law 167 formula, or decided by the method of the slide-rule. The import¬ ance of the principle of responsibility in connection with causation may indeed seem peculiar to law. But where causation is in any sense material the necessary tendency to the selection of the cause is present. In historical thought this has been illustrated by an excellent little book by Professor Mare Bloch, a French patriot who gave his life in the Resistance. I may quote a brief passage from the excellent translation, published Manchester 1954, from the chapter dealing with Historical Causation. At page 190 he refers to the fact that " establishment of relations of cause and effect con¬ stitute an instinctive need of our understanding " but adds that it " demands a conscious critical treatment." He then has some pages on the theory of the single cause. " Let us suppose " he says, " that a man is walking along a mountain path. He trips and fails off a precipice. For this accident to happen the combination of a great number of determining elements was necessary, such as among others the existence of gravity, a terrain resulting from protracted geological changes, the laying out of a path for the purpose, let us say, of connecting a village with its summer pastures. It would therefore be perfectly legitimate to say that were the laws of celestial mechanics different, had the evolution of the earth been otherwise, were alpine economy not founded on the seasonal migration of flocks, the fail would not have happened. Neverthe¬ less, should he inquire as to the cause, everyone would answer: a mis-step." If space permitted, I should like to give a longer quotation of his view why " we can scarcely avoid the feeling that it was the sole cause." He adds that from the point of view of common sense, which has always been reluctant to rid itself of a certain anthropomorphism, in speaking of cause, we fix on this last-minute component, this specific and unexpected component. He refers to the subordination of the perspective to the peculiar angle of the inquiry, and the search for a value judgment. The judge expresses it as: who is right and who is wrong. It has been said that strictly speaking the cause of any event is the whole state of the universe at the critical moment. But obviously such a view would be fatal to rational action. The approach of the judicial inquiry is the quest of justice, the search for the responsible person. Lord Sumner's statement was made with reference to a claim for personal injuries for tortious conduct. It would substantially apply to charges of crime, and indeed to all cases in which it is sought to establish responsibility for wrong¬ ful action. It might also with a little adjustment apply to the numerous lawsuits in which the issue arises in regard to a particular obligation in which the obligation is expressly described, such as</page><page sequence="6">168 The Cambridge Law Journal [1955] contracts or statutes, and the question is whether the facts can be fitted into statutory framework. The judicial inquiry is ex post facto and seeks to fix or negative liability. In addition to the con¬ struction of the terms of the obligation, there are generally issues of fact in order to decide responsibility. In the end the whole will tend mostly to converge on the single cause. The " monism of Cause " will force itself to the front. It is not easy to choose instances to illustrate this because they are so multifarious that the principle seems axiomatic. I can illustrate that later in cases to which I shall refer but it must be familiar to all common lawyers who have had long and wide experience of actual practice at the Bar or on the Bench. I may perhaps usefully take one or two instances from a vast number of possibles, which may also illustrate what has been called competition of causes, that is a contest which of several possible causes is the cause. This the court (judge or jury) must decide. I shall not seek to develop but might refer in passing to another category of cases which involve the decision of questions of cause and effect—I mean in cases of damage where the liability of the defendant is limited to such consequences as are not too remote. In cases of contract that generally depends on the rules laid down in Hadley v. Baxendale, and sometimes a standard is fixed by the contract. In cases of injury in general the consequences may by law be limited to what can be reasonably or naturally contem¬ plated. As extreme illustrations I may mention two out of hundreds, The Oropesa [1943] P. 32 and Summers v. Salford Corporation [1943] A.C. 283. In such cases also the monism of cause is generally observed. And equally " Cause" means responsible cause. There are a vast number of decisions on the question of the contest of causes. I can only cite two or three all, as it happens, connected with the sea and maritime affairs. The great case of Samuel v. Dumas [1924] A.C. 431 centred on the decision whether a ship separately insured against sea perils and war risks, was lost by the one peril or the other. The ship was shown to have been criminally scuttled by her owner in order to collect the insurance moneys but physically and in the last resort she sank because the sea connections had been opened deliberately to fill her with water. There was a great contest and conflict of opinion but in the end the cause was held to be the criminal action of her owners, and the claim failed. Among a host of authorities I may cite Yorkshire Dale S.S. Company case [1942] A.C. 691 where though the sea actually did the damage, the war risk was held on the facts to be the cause. The headnote states a principle of wide application.</page><page sequence="7">C.L.J. Causation and Responsibility in English Law 169 " The proximate cause of the loss of a ship is not necessarily the one which operates last, but is the effective and predominant cause selected from among co-operating causes. This choice of the real and effective cause from out of the whole complex of the facts must be made by applying common-sense standards." A similar case, The Priam [1948] A.C. 243, was a further illustration. The quest throughout is to find the cause on which responsibility depends. I have spent a good deal of space in seeking to explain the monistic view of legal causation but it could only be satisfactorily justified by a complete anthology of the illustrative cases. One would not expect to be provided with all the cases in which negli¬ gence has been established. The common lawyer has a sufficient store in his own mind and his experience: in the same way every common lawyer who gives it a brief thought would be conscious of the general effect in his mind of the particular instances which crowd upon it. The rule is clear and simple however multifarious the particular instances. It is noteworthy that Lord Porter, who has been concerned with such cases for thirty years or more, was content in Stapley v. Gypsum Mines, Ltd. (infra) to state the rule and apply it as little more than an obvious conclusion: he had indeed in a careful judgment explained the situation and that seemed to him enough. There may be difficult cases where it is doubtful if the dominating cause which is necessary to found responsibility is sufficiently clear, or where there are complicating circumstances which need to be weighed. Hence Lord Reid's caveatl which I quote below. But the broad rule stands; its subject is the decision of particular cases and on the particular circumstances of these cases what the facts require; and in the appropriate case, the fixing of the sole cause is the culminating point of the judicial inquiry, and requires the highest qualities of judicial ability. Liability may of course be shared by several persons, as where you have joint or concurrent wrongdoers, each in his particular way, causing the event. As illustration I may quote Grant v. Sun Shipping Co. [1948] A.C. 549. And the sharing may be between the plaintiff and the defendant, as is now provided by the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act of 1945. It will be enough here to take as a mere illustration of the difficulties arising a case which recently went to the House of Lords, Stapley v. Gypsum Mines, Ltd. [1953] A.C. 663. The action was brought by the widow, Mrs. Stapley, claiming 1 " To determine what caused an accident from the point of view of legal liability is a most difficult task . . . Sometimes it is proper to discard all but one and to regard that one as the sole cause ... I doubt whether any test can be applied generally." [1953] A.C. at p. 681.</page><page sequence="8">170 The Cambridge Law Journal [1955] damages from the defendants for the death of her late husband caused by their negligence as employers. Before the trial judge, Sellers J., only two of the original heads were considered, which were that the company failed to make the stope or working place secure contrary both to common law and to applicable regulations. The stope or working place was dangerous because the roof might fail and kill any man working under it. Hence the most stringent regulations and statutory rules, and stringent rules of the workers' obedience to orders. The dangerous part of the roof was apparent because it was " drummy," i.e., gave a hollow sound if tapped. The judge held that the company had failed to keep the roof of the stope safe, so that it fell and killed Stapley but that Stapley was partly in fault and partly responsible because he had deliberately resumed work in breach of the law and of the applicable regulations and contrary also to the orders of the foreman, who on the roof being found "drummy," said " f etch it down" which amounted to an order not to work under the roof until by recog¬ nised methods it had been brought down and the place made safe. In effect the judge held that the company was liable for Stapley's death, but that 50 per cent. should be deducted because Stapley had been contributorily negligent in resuming work under the drummy roof. The Court of Appeal reversed that decision, in particular on the ground that " if the inquiry to be made is: What was the cause of Stapley's death? then the answer must be that it was his own breach of duty in resuming work under the drummy roof. If he had not done that, it is obvious he would not have been killed " (I quote from the judgment of Birkett L.J.). When the case went to the House of Lords there was a difference of opinion: the widow was held by the majority, Lords Oaksey, Reid and Tucker, entitled to recover but the damage was reduced from 50 per cent. to 20 per cent., because of the deceased man's breach of duty and misconduct in resuming work under the drummy roof— which was treated as contributory negligence. The dissentient minority, Lords Porter and Asquith, agreed with the decision of the Court of Appeal; thus Lords Porter and Asquith were prepared to settle the issue on the simple ground of the sole cause, of the answer to the question " who caused Stapley's death ? " The whole event in Lord Porter's words was " brought about by his own return to the stope." Lord Porter found there a complete and simple answer which superseded any further analyses or refined reasoning, or any investigation of antecedent or accessorial inducing conditions. It was an independent affirmative act, final in character. Stapley in defiance of all safety rules of the mines, of all his own experience, of the whole discipline of the mines, of the</page><page sequence="9">C.L.J. Causation and Responsibility in English Law 171 foreman's specific order, deliberately of his own self-will went into a place of certain danger; it was as it were a fresh departure, what I have elsewhere called an ultroneous act. It was amply sufficient to account for his death: no further explanation was to be sought or found in the various conditions existing before the fatal moment. Lord Asquith gave some parallels from history which may seem a little far-fetched but do emphasise his point that Stapley's act had a " revolutionary " character in the small circle of ordinary working life into which it was suddenly projected. The result in its insignificant setting was cataclysmic. There were all the elements which would justify the conclusion of the ex post facto judicial inquiry as voiced by Lord Porter. That was the particular finding in that particular case. Like all such it is a specific finding " in the circumstances." Lord Porter after his judicial summary of the situation found no occasion for further justification. I cannot see that this conclusion is affected by the Act of 1945, on contributory negligence. I am content to follow Lord Porter in thinking that the suggested reasons for rejecting the conclusive- ness of the ultimate cause, which merged and superseded all the conditions that went before, fail. In truth, even if they were to be brought into reckoning, they fully deserve Lord Porter's sum- mation that they were " elusive and difficult." I cannot prolong this essay to examine the suggested contributory negligence. Lord Porter shrewdly observes that if he accepted the view of the House of Lords on the point he would place the degree of blame attributable to anyone other than Stapley at an infinitesimal quantity, but he expresses no opinion. But I refrain from further criticism because the object of this essay is, as I have said, to emphasise once more the legal theory of cause and also the wide importance in the law of tort of the theory of the sole or monistic cause.</page></plain_text>
