<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeological News from Cyprus, 1973 KYRIAKOS NICOLAOU PLATES 26-34 This report is a summary of the principal ar- chaeological activities in Cyprus for the year 1973. Funds provided by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus enabled the Department of Antiquities to spend generously on museums, on the preserva- tion and restoration of ancient monuments, on ex- cavations and on various other activities. Generous contributions by the Church authorities have also enabled the Department of Antiquities to carry out the conservation and restoration of many churches and monasteries owned by the Church. The construction of a new Limassol Archaeo- logical Museum was completed during the year and the building handed over to the Department of Antiquities. All the antiquities previously housed in the Limassol Castle were transferred to the new Museum and the exhibition was put in hand. It is hoped to have it opened to the public during the coming year. Work continued on the reconstruc- tion of the Kyrenia shipwreck and on its exhibi- tion, together with the finds, in the Kyrenia Castle. Large scale excavations were resumed at major sites by both the Department of Antiquities and by foreign expeditions. Minor excavations, mainly res- cue ones, were also carried out in many parts of the island. The museums, the monuments and the sur- vey branches of the Department had another year of full activities. The protection of the island's cul- tural heritage has been another of the main pre- occupations of the Department of Antiquities. The cleaning, conservation, and restoration of a large bronze cauldron of the end of the eighth century B.C., found in Tomb 79 at Salamis, was completed after four years of work in the laboratory of the Mainz Museum in Germany and returned this year to Nicosia. It will soon go on public exhibition in the Cyprus Museum (pl. 26, fig. i). See AJA 71, 402. Principal publications include the Report of the Department of Antiquities of Cyprus i973 with contributions on Cypriot archaeology or related sub- jects by members of the Department of Antiquities and by foreign scholars, the Acts of the Interna- tional Archaeological Symposium; The Myce- naeans in the Eastern Mediterranean, containing communications and discussions made during the Symposium organized in 1972 in Nicosia; the Ex- cavations in the Necropolis of Salamis, Vol. III by the Director of the Department, and the Annual Report of the Director of the Department of An- tiquities for the year 1972, which deals with the activities of the Department.

The French Archaeological Mission of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, headed by Mr. Alain Le Brun car- ried out its fourth season of excavations at the Neolithic settlement of Kastros at the very tip of Cape St. Andreas. The excavations were conducted in the south sector of the site, where remains of four more circu- lar huts were revealed (pl. 30, fig. 20). One of them, preserved intact, has a diameter of 2.60 m. This was built of two, not concentric, walls of stone and earth. The walls are preserved to a height of I m.</page><page sequence="4">128 KYRIAKOS NICOLAOU [AJA 79 (pl. 30, fig. 21). A tomb was also excavated. The corpse, in contracted position, was found in a shal- low trench sunk along the edge of the precipice. A few perforated sea-shells were the only tomb gifts. Bone objects found include fish-hooks, points, needles, burins, burins fixed on bones, and a small spoon. Knives and blades of obsidian as well as stone corn rubbers were also recovered. Aghios Epiktitos. The British Archaeological Ex- pedition from the University of Glasgow, headed by Dr. E.J. Peltenburg, carried out its fifth season of excavations at the Neolithic settlement of Vrysi on the coastal headland due N of Aghios Epiktitos village. This year's excavations were aimed at linking two previously uncovered areas in the settlement so that a general plan of the site could be obtained. This attempt proved unsuccessful because the struc- tures of each area were separated by a knoll of natural clay, so that two distinct sectors of the set- tlement were identified. The material culture of these two sectors, however, is similar. Each one possesses several irregularly shaped single room houses with off-centre hearths and a communica- tion system through narrow, winding passages that were inclined a few degrees to facilitate drainage in central channels (pl. 30, fig. 22). Five new huts were discovered, two of them completely excavated. Where well preserved, most huts show a develop- ment in which each was rebuilt twice on roughly the same lines as its predecessor. In order to test the extent of the settlement be- yond this area a trial trench was opened about 30 m. to the east. Here a well constructed sub-square hut was investigated with three sides built of stone walls, while the fourth was either made of organic materials or was left open. Traces of occupation further east indicate that the whole headland was occupied, but the larger excavated area suggests that such occupation existed in dense clusters rather than in a uniform spread. Work underneath the stone built huts revealed another settlement of which very little is known yet. Floor furnishings differ considerably and its pottery resembles that of the earliest stone huts. Perhaps associated with this earlier phase is a ditch dug partly across the landward side of the headland as a defensive measure. It is at least 4 m. deep and 6.70 m. wide and shows that at Vrysi there is a com- plex series of Neolithic developments extending throughout most of the fourth millennium B.C. if not into the fifth. Morphou. The Archaeological Expedition to Cy- prus from Harvard University and from the Mu- seum of Fine Arts, Boston, directed by Prof. Emily Vermeule and Dr. Cornelius Vermeule, carried out their third season of excavations at the Late Bronze Age settlement of Toumba tou Skourou due N of Morphou. The structures revealed earlier on the mound were made more intelligible. It is part of a large town which flourished at the very end of the Mid- dle and throughout the Late Bronze Age. The mound, known as Toumba tou Skourou was origi- nally an industrial quarter for making pottery. It must have been destroyed by fire in the middle of the sixteenth century B.C. after which much debris was accumulated and spread over the old floors to form a new working area. During the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries the site flourished once more, again as an industrial quarter but this time for the smelting of copper which was being ex- tracted in the hills near Skouriotissa. Large pithoi were found in situ, some of which have been re- stored on the site (pl. 30, fig. 23). Three more tombs were discovered dating from the very beginning of the Late Bronze Age. As for the previous ones, they contained much pottery and also bronzes. Phlamoudi. The American Expedition of Co- lumbia University, New York, carried out its fourth season of excavations at the localities Vou- nari and Melissa under the direction of Prof. E. Porada and Prof. S. Symeonoglou, respectively. The excavations at Vounari brought to light a monumental substructure, built with a large amount of stones, of what was probably a platform on top of the mound (pl. 31, fig. 24). This struc- ture dates from the Late Cypriote IB period, rough- ly between 155o and 1450 B.C. At that time the top of the hill had a retaining wall with added but- tresses and a walkway with two retaining walls beyond it. This ensemble is well preserved on the S side. A monumental entrance gave access to the building on the N side. Remains of the Archaic period at this end show a limited reconstruction of the building. In Hellenistic times a sanctuary was built on the mound. The earlier structures on the Vounari mound may have similarly served as a sacred place. At Melissa the poorly preserved remains of the Late Cypriote IA period (ca. I600-I5oo00 B.C.) were</page><page sequence="5">1975] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS FROM CYPRUS, 1973 129 further investigated but most of this year's work was concentrated on the important Late Cypriote II B.C. (ca. 1350-1200 B.C.) building. It was built with large ashlar blocks and consists of a large central area divided into two parts. Porches opened on the E and on the W. The large quantity of My- cenaean pottery found indicates strong Mycenaean influence. Within the building a large storeroom was found which has so far yielded the remains of 20 large pithoi with the remains of charred olives and wood. A haematite cylinder seal found here is of a typically Cypriot style with designs partly de- rived from the Near East but stylistically resem- bling gems from Mycenae and Crete. The dis- covery of cornelian beads and of a set of small tools suggests the presence of craftsmen working at Melissa. A gold leaf and a small heap of ivory ob- jects were also discovered. Hala Sultan Tekke. The Swedish Cyprus Expe- dition from the University of Gothenburg carried out its second season of excavations at the locality Vizakia, near Hala Sultan Tekke, on the W side of the Larnaca Salt Lake, under the direction of Prof. Paul Astr6m. The building, which was excavated in the previ- ous season, was further investigated. It consists of a courtyard with an inner room, possibly a sanc- tuary. Around this building were several stelai with holes and incisions, possibly figuring ships and a god. In a bothros were found Mycenaean, Syrian and Cypriote pottery, Mycenaean terracotta figurines, a dice, and several faience frigments. A remarkable discovery this year was a clay ball with four Cypro-Minoan signs, similar to the balls of Enkomi. Most of the finds date from the Late Cypriote III period. Two superimposed ash layers may be related to two major destructions at the be- ginning of the eleventh century B.C. An underwater exploration between Kiti and Cape Greco, begun in 1972, continued this year. Among the finds may be noted Late Bronze Age stone anchors, a Roman lead anchor, Phoenician, Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic and Graeco-Roman jars. Kition. The Department of Antiquities continued its excavations at Kathari, in the northern part of Kition, under the direction of Dr. V. Karage- orghis. The bedrock was reached in Temenos A and B and another area was investigated E of the sacred quarter. Temenos A, on the N of Temple i, has been completely excavated. Apart from the high altar with the horns of consecration which was dis- covered earlier, a second one was found at the west- ern part of the temenos. It rises slightly above the floor level and was covered with ashes mixed with carbonized bones and sherds. It seems likely that the high-built altar was used for offerings, whereas the low one was for real animal sacrifices. More light has also been thrown on the sacred gardens of the sacred area. They were already in existence in the Late Cypriote II period in the space between Temples 2 and 3. When Temple i was built to- wards the end of the thirteenth century B.C. some of the pits and irrigation channels of the gardens were covered by its N wall, so that the gardens had to be replanned. They were confined within the large courtyard of Temple i, where trees were planted as indicated by the pits still visible on the ground. Further information was obtained as to the smelt- ing of copper. Large quantities of copper slag were found in a file below floor III, together with a good number of Late Cypriote II sherds, including My- cenaean III B. This indicates that the smelting of copper in area II started before the construction of the workshops N of Temple i, though it is not known yet where the smelting took place. Evidence, however, was found earlier indicating that there was smelting also in Area I during the Late Cypri- ote II period. Investigation to the E of the sanctuaries com- plex has shown that there was a public square and beyond it another temple, Temple 4 (pl. 31, fig. 25, in the foreground). This seems to be contemporary with Temples i and 2, i.e. dating from the end of the thirteenth century B.C. Its south wall, built against the city-wall, is constructed of ashlar blocks of hard limestone. It has a continuous life until about iooo B.C. In the ninth century B.C. it was rebuilt as a Phoenician sanctuary with altars and pillars. More information about this new sacred complex should be obtained during next year's excavations. Aghia Irini. The Italian Expedition to Aghia Irini, directed by Prof. Giovanni Rizza, carried out its fourth season of excavations at the locality Palaiokastro on behalf of the Institute of Myce- naean and Aegeo-Anatolian Studies, Rome. The excavations were confined to trial trenches in order to establish a chronological sequence of the site. The first trench on the N slope of Palaio-</page><page sequence="6">130 KYRIAKOS NICOLAOU [AJA 79 kastro, gave a continuous stratigraphy dating down- wards from Graeco-Roman, Hellenistic, and Geo- metric times. A few sherds of the Late Bronze Age were also recovered in the lowest layers. The sec- ond trench, which was opened along the eastern part of the city-wall, revealed the existence of at least two periods of the wall, an Archaic and a Hellenistic one. The third trench, which was opened outside the SE corner of the city-wall, pro- duced evidence of an Archaic and a Hellenistic occupation. The results obtained from these sound- ings are consistent and for the first time we are assured of a continuous occupation of Palaiokastro from the Late Bronze Age down to Graeco-Roman times. Palaipaphos. The German-Swiss Archaeological Expedition to Palaipaphos, sponsored by the Ger- man Archaeological Institute of Berlin and by the University of Zurich, conducted its eighth season of excavations under the direction of Prof. F.G. Maier. This year's main excavations were carried out in the area of the Temple of Aphrodite. The dis- covery of hundreds of sugar bowls and of glazed pottery all over the area shows that the temple site was used in Lusignan times by the sugar refinery attached to the nearby Royal Manor. This may have been one of the main reasons for the extensive destruction of the temple. The walls of the eastern wing, however, still stand to a considerable height but of the S stoa only the foundations survive. All these remains date from Graeco-Roman times. The S wing built of megalithic limestone blocks (pl. 28, fig. 26) is different from that of the main complex and has always been regarded as part of an earlier sanctuary. Unfortunately no stratigraphic or other evidence is available as to its date. Fortu- nately, however, the discovery this year of two square capitals (pl. 28, fig. 27) of the same Myce- naean type as those found at Kition and at Enkomi proves that the famous sanctuary of Paphian Aphrodite at Palaipaphos dates from the Late Bronze Age. The finds of Mycenaean and Late Cypriote pottery from the Temple site confirm also the Late Bronze Age foundation of the city and the origin of the sanctuary. Thus the legend of the foundation of the Temple of Aphrodite at Paphos by Agapenor is clearly based upon histori- cal fact. The fact that fragments of Chalcolithic pottery have been found for the first time only suggests that the temple area was occupied at a much earlier period. Idalion. The American Expedition to Cyprus sponsored by Harvard University and by the In- stitute of Cypriote Studies of the State University of New York at Albany, headed by the late Prof. G. Ernest Wright, carried out its third season of excavations at Idalion as well as a survey of the area around it. In the city-site the excavations were resumed at the western city-wall and in the lower city. The excavations at this part of the circuit showed that the fortifications of Idalion were built during the Classical period. However, remains of an earlier tower were found below the bastion which was cleared in the previous season. In the lower city the excavations were confined to the residential area where domestic architecture was uncovered in 1972. Two houses and a cobbled street con- structed some time during the transitional period from Archaic to Classical times were cleared. An Archaic phase of the structures, however, was also found consisting of a series of floors and of roughly circular pits found filled with pottery. Tamassos. The German Archaeological Expedi- tion to Tamassos sponsored by the German Archae- ological Institute of Berlin, headed by Prof. H.-G. Buchholz, carried out its fourth season of excava- tions in the sanctuary area. The sanctuary (AIA [19731 429) and the in- dustrial quarter were further investigated. More evidence for metallurgical activities as well as more deposits of offerings in the sanctuary, have been brought to light. The latter include pottery, both local and Attic, lamps, coins, terracotta figurines, miniature altars and thymiateria of limestone and stone statuettes of female figures, dating from Ar- chaic to Hellenistic times. This may be a sanctuary of Aphrodite. To the E of the sanctuary the Ex- pedition investigated further the foundations of the Archaic-Classical city-well. The bronze blinker dis- covered earlier has now been treated and the ivory eye inserted in its original position (pl. 32, fig. 28). Nea Paphos. The Department of Antiquities of Cyprus with the present author in charge resumed excavations at the Odeon and at the House of Dionysos. Odeon. This year's excavations were mainly con- centrated in front of the Odeon, beyond the stage building, where earlier evidence showed that there was a long portico parallel to the stage building. A</page><page sequence="7">1975] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS FROM CYPRUS, 1973 131 wide street runs between the stage-building and the portico. The foundations of the substructure where a series of columns rested were excavated to a length of nearly ioo m. Remains of the S stylobate were also cleared to a length of about 20 m. It is likely that in front of the Odeon spread a large square portico, about ioo m. x 100oo m., pos- sibly a Gymnasium or an Asklepieion. Shafts of columns in granite and other architectural mem- bers were also found (pl. 33, fig. 29) suggesting a peristyle portico. To the SW of the Odeon was cleared part of the western wall of a large building attached to the Odeon. House of Dionysos. The investigation of the pits, having an average depth of 5 m., W of the House of Dionysos, has been completed. Three wells, about 9 m. deep, yielding rich material, have also been cleared. It has now been confirmed that the pits were originally a quarry, which remained exposed for a long time as suggested by their much eroded sides (pl. 31, fig. 30). Walls built on the bottom of the pits as well as many holes on the upper sides indicate that small rooms were sub- sequently built, used most likely as storerooms. At a still later period, in mid-Hellenistic times, the pits were filled in with rubble for levelling pur- poses, apparently when the first building phase began in this part of the town. It seems that these quarries were used at the time of the foundation of Paphos, towards the end of the fourth century B.C., for there is sufficient evidence to show that the town began at its eastern sector before spreading west. Among this year's finds are large numbers of pottery, including fine Pergamene and Arretine ware, lamps, coins, terra- cotta figurines, and clay masks, all of Hellenistic and Graeco-Roman times. The final study of the pottery found on the mo- saic pavement of the House of Dionysos shows that the mosaics may well date from the early sec- ond century A.D. and not from the late third as hitherto believed. The Polish Archaeological Expedition under Dr. A.W. Daszewski, sponsored by the University of Warsaw and Narodowe Museum, conducted its ninth season of excavations at the Palace of The- seus. The palace bath establishment at the SE corner of the edifice was completely cleared. It comprises a spacious central hall, the frigidarium, and a smaller one for ablutions. S of the frigidarium lies a series of rooms with hypocaust, basins for hot water, the praefurnium and the main reservoir supplying the bath with water. A large vestibule lies to the E. Many rooms of the bath establish- ment are paved with mosaics of a geometric pat- tern and have painted walls. Exploration at the W part of the building re- sulted in the discovery of several complete and frag- mentary statues. Among the better preserved ones is a torso of a naked female figure with a sword (pl. 34, fig. 30a) and a statue, probably Artemis, wearing a long chiton (pl. 34, fig. 3ob). All the sculptures date from Graeco-Roman times. Their discovery as well as others found in previous cam- paigns suggests that many statues embellished this palace, probably the residence of a high ranking Imperial official, perhaps the Governor of the island itself. Mr. A. Papageorghiou, Curator of Ancient Monuments, continued the investigation of the site of the Early Christian basilica church on which now stands the smaller church of Aghia Kyriaki. The excavations were carried out to the E and to the N of Aghia Kyriaki. At a depth of 2.85 m. to the E the remains of the central apse of the basilica, measuring 9 m. in diam., were uncovered. It is now shown beyond doubt that the three huge columns in granite still standing (AJA [1973] pl. 83, fig. 36) belong to the central nave of the Early Christian basilica church. The apse of the northern inner aisle was also uncovered. This was well pre- served for after the destruction of the basilica it was incorporated in a small Byzantine church. There is evidence that the northern outer aisle ter- minated also in an apse so that the 40 m. wide ba- silica church had altogether five apses. Part of the northern outer wall of the basilica was also cleared. Its total length was 47 m. The floor of the N outer aisle was paved with beautiful mosaics (pl. 34, fig. 31). Kourion. The Department of Antiquities of Cyprus with the Archaeological Officer Mr. M. Loulloupis in charge, resumed excavations in the area of the House of Gladiators. To the W of this house a 4 m. wide street was uncovered paved with stones. Immediately to the W of the street the re- mains of a spacious building were also uncovered. This building consists of a central part, the vesti- bule and the main hall, flanked on either side by three small rooms. The vestibule and the first of the three rooms opened to the street. The entrance</page><page sequence="8">132 KYRIAKOS NICOLAOU [AJA 79 to the vestibule was provided with two columns in the centre and pilasters at the sides. The main hall is a square apsidal room. The floor of the apse was higher by a step than that of the rest of the room. The floor of this hall was paved with mosaics of geometric and floral patterns round two central emblems, one a fine rosette, the other a bird about to peck a pomegranate. The side rooms are also paved with mosaics all of plain geometric patterns. Adjacent to this building but forming part of it was an open air courtyard peristyle on three sides (pl. 33, fig. 32). The fourth was a wall with three doors opening on the street. The floor of the porti- cos was paved with mosaics of plain geometric pattern, while the courtyard was paved with marble slabs. The building is dated to the fourth century A.D. Mr. A. Christodou, the Assistant Archaeological Officer, resumed excavations, on behalf of the De- partment of Antiquities, at the site of an Early Christian basilica church E of the Stadium of Kourion. The excavations were carried out in the atrium and in the rooms N of it. The atrium was peristyle with two entrances to the N and to the S. Most of its floor paved with limestone slabs has been preserved. In the centre of the atrium a cistern was found used in later times as a limekiln. Finds include architectural members, especially Corin- thian capitals, pottery, and bronze coins. Soloi. The Canadian Archaeological Expedition to Soloi of the University of Laval, Quebec, headed by Prof. Jean des Gagniers and assisted by Profs. Lily Kahil, Rene Ginouves and Tran Tam Tinh, resumed excavations at the Agora, on the Acropo- lis and at the Early Christian basilica church, in two seasons, in spring and autumn. The previous year's excavations on the south side of the Agora had brought to light various ar- chitectural members, which were thought to be- long to a Nymphaeum. This assumption has now been confirmed by the discovery of more architec- tural remains of marble of excellent quality and remains of a reservoir all of which are associated with the Nymphaeum (pl. 32, fig. 33). On top of the Acropolis, near the temple of Athe- na, excavated in 1929 by the Swedish Cyprus Ex- pedition, a preliminary investigation brought to light important remains of a palatial building dated to the Hellenistic period (pl. 32, fig. 33a). The excavations at the Early Christian basilica church were confined to the SW part, where a large amount of debris was removed revealing im- portant remains. The interior of the second basilica has now been fully uncovered. It is a three-aisled basilica with three apses, measuring 52.Io x 30 m. and dating to the sixth century A.D. Its floor was paved with multi-coloured marble opus sectile (pl. 32, fig. 33b). At least two columns with their drums, measuring 6.40 m. in height, have been found lying down in situ at the S side of the church. Further exploration below the destroyed floor of the second basilica revealed the floor of the earlier one. This was five-aisled and measured 46 m. x 27.50 m. Much of its original floor paved with mosaics of coloured geometric patterns has been preserved in good condition. This first basilica dates from the fourth century A.D. and may well be the oldest basilica church in Cyprus. Salamis. The French Expedition of the Univer- sity of Lyon continued its excavations at Salamis in two seasons. The spring campaign was headed by Prof. Jean Pouilloux and the autumn one by Mme. Marguerite Yon. The aim of the spring season was the further investigation of the Temple of Zeus which started in 1970 but which was first excavated in 1890 by a British Expedition. The four corners of the podium which supported the cella were uncovered as well as the staircase and the ramp on the Agora (north- ern) side of the temple (pl. 32, fig. 33c). The stair- case is built of marble blocks, one of them taken from an earlier Doric building. Part of the marble pavement of the cella is still preserved in situ. Present evidence indicates that the first phase of the building dates to the second century B.C. and that there are successive alterations and reconstructions down to the time of Justinian. In the autumn the excavation of a complex of buildings, begun earlier S of the Campanopetra basilica church, was resumed. It is now clear that there was a sanctuary of the Geometric and Archaic period. Excavations were also resumed at the Early Byzantine complex known as "L'huilerie." The limits of this large building were uncovered on all sides but the W. The original building belongs to the type of Roman house consisting of several rooms round an atrium. During the fifth century A.D. it was enlarged and was decorated with friezes of stucco. It appears to have lasted down to the period of Constans II.</page><page sequence="9">1975] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS FROM CYPRUS, 1973 133 MINOR EXCAVATIONS In the prehistoric cemetery of Aghia Paraskevi on the SE part of Nicosia, two half-looted tombs of the Middle Bronze Age were excavated produc- ing much pottery of White Painted, Red Polished, and Red Slip ware. Also three terracotta figurines, one representing a bearded human figure (pl. 31, fig. 34) and two others representing quadrupeds. CS2028. Six tombs of the early eleventh century B.C. were excavated at the locality Alaas between the villages of Gastria and Aghios Theodoros in the Karpas peninsula. The chambers were rather small with or without dromos. They yielded much fine pot- tery of Proto-White Painted ware, including stirrup jars, bottles, kylikes, zoomorphic vases, pyxides, askoi, jugs, bowls, large and small amphorae, and others (pl. 33, fig- 35). Gold earrings were also found as well as four bronze scales of plated ar- mour, similar to those found at Enkomi. CS204I- 2042, 2052-2058. Sixteen tombs of the Cypro-Geometric III period were excavated at a hitherto unknown cemetery at Chrysospeliotissa, near Deftera village due SW of Nicosia. They yielded much pottery of various types, terracotta figurines, iron objects and others. Mention may be made of a Black-on-Red I (III) ware shallow bowl decorated on the outside with a bird, two fishes, a "tray" motif and concentric circles (pl. 33, fig. 36). CS2003-2009 and 2011-2019. Also a kylix of Bichrome III ware decorated with a bird. Three tombs of the same period were ex- cavated at Lapithus producing, apart from pottery, a pair of gold-plated rings, bronze bracelets, etc. CS20I0, 2020-2021. ANCIENT MONUMENTS Preservation and restoration continued especially in churches and monasteries. Unless otherwise stated work was carried out by the Department of Antiquities under the supervision of M.A. Papa- georghiou, Curator of Ancient Monuments. Only a brief mention is made of selected sites. Work continued on the consolidation and resto- ration of the Gothic Cathedral of Aghia Sophia, now Selemiye mosque in Nicosia. The vaults of the chapel on the N side of the Cathedral were repaired and a reinforced concrete tie-beam was inserted in the walls at the springing of the vaults. The underpinning of the N wall between the N entrance and the above-mentioned chapel was completed. The provisions for the isolation and protection from dampness of one of the Royal Tombs of Tamassos were completed. The stairs leading down to the tomb and the stone floor of the chambers were repaired. The cleaning and consolidation of the frescoes of the church of Aghios Nikolaos tis Stegis was continued. The two layers of frescoes covering the eastern vault of the church were separated. The later ones (fourteenth century) were transported to Nicosia for treatment and the clearing of the original eleventh century frescoes was started. The restoration of the Monastery of Aghios Ioannis Lampadistis at Kalopanayiotis continued throughout the year. The cleaning of the wall- paintings of the narthex of the church was also undertaken. The upper part of the panel of the Last Judgement was cleaned of soot and dust. Two other panels depicting miracles of Christ were also treated. The cleaning and consolidation of the wall paint- ings in the church of Antiphonitis was continued. This year parts of the frescoes of the dome, in- cluding Christ Pantocrator, were treated. Among other frescoes treated were the Last Judgement (pl. 34, fig. 37) on the north wall of the church and the Nativity and Presentation of Christ in the eastern pseudosquinches. Parts of the vaults were made waterproof. General repairs and consolidation were carried out in various monuments at Salamis, including the Gymnasium, the Theatre, the Reservoir, and the basilica churches of Aghios Epiphanios and of Campanopetra. The wall mosaic in one of the niches of the Gymnasium baths was consolidated. Of the theatre three rows of seats in the cavea were revetted in imitation of the original. In the Rizokarpaso area two churches were re- paired. The church of Aghia Athanasia which was in danger of collapse, was consolidated and a door was provided. The narthex of the twelfth century vaulted church of Aghios Philon ton Agridion was also repaired. The uprooting of trees growing on either side revealed a chapel to the S and the wings of a verandah supported on arches on the N side. The excavated remains at Kathari in the north- ern end of Kition were consolidated. Work con- tinued in the church of Aghios Lazaros in Larnaca,</page><page sequence="10">134 KYRIAKOS NICOLAOU [AJA 79 among which the construction of a canalization sys- tem against dampness and the treatment with chemicals of stones against weathering. At Kourion the N wall and parts of the E and W walls of the Stadium were repaired. Repairs were also carried out on the mosaics of the House of the Gladiators and on those of the Early Chris- tian basilica church. The opus sectile of the latter and its walls were also treated. Further consolida- tion was carried out on the remains of the Temple of Apollo Hylates. At Paphos the restoration of the outer wall of the Odeon was continued. The mosaics and the re- mains of the House of Dionysos were also treated. Similar treatment was carried out in the House of Theseus. At Kouklia the reconstruction of the S wall of the Royal Manor was continued and a mo- saic pavement found nearby was consolidated. The reconstruction of the NW aisle of the Monastery of Aghios Neophytos was put in hand this year. The mosaics in the churches of Aghios Georghios tis Peyias received further treatment. ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY The Archaeological Survey Branch of the De- partment of Antiquities of Cyprus with Mr. M. Loulloupis, Mr. A. Christodoulou and Mr. D. Christou in charge have had another active year. Among other activities the above team was re- sponsible for rescue excavations all over the island, for the inspection of sites and the prevention of tomb looting; it also copes successfully with the illegal dealing in antiquities which in recent years has been very widespread. The collections kept at the Survey's headquarters are increasing and have again proved of great interest to students of Cypriot archaeology.
