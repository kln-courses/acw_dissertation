Stud. 25, pp. 225-233 ROBERT ELLIS THE VULNERABILITY OF ACTION Human agents, unless they be crazed by some impediment of mind, are usually all too painfully aware of the risks inherent in their task of exercising agency. We are vulnerable as we act to forces not fully within our control, to unsound judgements which we ourselves make, and to the limits of our own reach which we sometimes miss or ignore. However, it is common enough in orthodox Christian circles, when transposing the concepts of action and agency to the divine, to remove the element of risk which so closely accompanies our own experience of action. God, it is claimed, is the perfect agent - who never fails - who accomplishes all and everything he sets out to do. Of course voices of protest have been raised against such an idea of God. Those jealous of creaturely freedom, or who find the problems posed in theodicy too intractable, or who have been influenced by a variety of Greek or other writers (Schelling, for instance), try to maintain that God's action too is vulnerable in a way directly analogous to our own. More recently the Process Theologians, led on this campaign by Charles Hartshorne, have endeavoured to offer a new analysis of power in an attempt to portray a God whose agency is not irresistible. Indeed, Ian G. Barbour is one writer who has spurned the model of the divine agent and turned to process theology on exactly such grounds, believing that the agent model of God prohibits creaturely freedom to an unacceptable degree.1 However, in this paper I will suggest a three-pronged argument to the effect that the vulnerability of all actions does not depend upon the agent, but is instead presupposed within the concept of action itself as we usually understand it. And thus, that if we are to use this concept of God - anal? ogously, metaphorically, or simply equivocally ! - in an intelligible way our use must take account of this ingrained feature. First we shall examine the correlation of the agent and the other; second we shall peruse Hornsby's effort to define an action as a ' trying to act ' ; and finally we shall repair to our old acquaintances, 'basic' and 'complex' actions. I. THE CORRELATION OF 'SELF' AND 'OTHER' The first distortion we consider arises from the tendency to see the Self in abstraction : the agent as solo. John Macmurray, in his The Self as Agent,2 has 1 Ian G. Barbour, Myths, Models and Paradigms (SCM, London, 1974), p. 161. 2, The Self as Agent (1953 Gifford Lectures, vol I) (Faber, London, 1957).</page><page sequence="2">226 ROBERT ELLIS an exemplary discussion of this problem. In a central chapter on the ' Impli? cations of Action ' he considers the Self in such abstraction from everything else for theoretical purposes. To a point the procedure proves fruitful. Mac murray establishes the irreversibility of action (and the limitation upon freedom which that itself provides). 'What has been determined remains forever determinate; what has been done cannot be undone. Action is irreversible. That time is irreversible is merely the abstract or formal way of stating this.'1 Such an abstraction also allows the elucidation of action as choice. 'Now since action is irreversible, when he [an agent] acts, and so moves in one of the possible directions, all the others become, by his action, impossible. His action, then, is a choice of one possibility which negates the possibility of all the others.'2 Such analysis of action as is often offered makes the mistake of remaining in this abstract world of the self as solo. The move from 'I think' to 'I act' is not a sufficient device to avoid the basic egocentricity of much of our philosophical tradition. An agent which is solitary and self-contained cannot provide the possibility of action. Abstracted from the presence of the Other, the Self is also abstracted from the possibility of resistance in action - and so from action itself. Macmurray boldly states that without a resistance there can be no action.3 Macmurray's argument owes something to certain scientific parallels or illustrations he draws. He tells us, for example, that moving includes its own negative - not rest as the mere absence of movement, but a negative activity - an active resistance to movement. ' If it did not', he comments, ' I could not move, I should simply fall down.'4 He compares our active resistance to moving as a condition for moving to the distinction between 'kinetic' and 'potential' energy. He also pictures the abstract, isolated, Agent-Self as Newton pictured a particle of matter in empty space. While useful for some purposes, such an abstraction is finally self-defeating. The case is prosecuted further by the asseveration that a solitary agent could not discriminate possible courses of action, not having any ground of discrimination outside of himself. Similarly, it is argued that if the Other is conceived as merely material resistance (as opposed to the resistance of another Self) the way is not opened up for action, but only for movement, or occurrence. ' For though the resistance limits the possibilities for the agent it still provides no ground for discriminating between the possibilities which remain open. Within the limits of his freedom the agent can still do as he pleases, and whatever he does will be right because he does it. He has the means of action, but no ground of action.'5 This assumes of course that an action must be right or wrong, appropriate or inappropriate. Such a con? clusion follows from the nature of action as choice. 'Knowingly to actualize 1 Ibid. p. 137. 2 Ibid. p. 139. 3 Ibid. p. 142. 4 Ibid. p. 129. 5 Ibid. p. 144.</page><page sequence="3">THE VULNERABILITY OF ACTION 227 one of a number of possibles, and in doing so to negate the others, is to characterize the act that is so performed as right and the others wrong.'1 Rightness is not the conclusion of any theoretical considerations, but of doing. Just as a proposition must be true or false, so an action must be right or wrong. If we grant the agent an organic environment ('Nature') instead of a purely material one something more than movement does become possible. Nature will provide stimuli to which he can respond. But action is still impossible. Nature can only reveal a plurality of possible activities - some easier, some difficult, some pleasurable, others painful. Still no ground of discrimination is given. The agent could only follow ' the line of least re? sistance', which excludes the determination of an objective. The solitary agent for whom the Other is an organic other, could itself only behave as an organism. Macmurray's conclusion is this: The possibility of action depends upon the Other being also agent, and so upon a plurality of agents in one field of action. The resistance to the Self through which the Self can exist as agent must be the resistance of another self.2* Just as Hartshorne and his supporters redefine power so that it only makes sense in the context of a plurality of other powers, so Macmurray has defined action as that which can only take place amongst a community of agents. Without the 'resistance' of others, the Agent-Self is a mere abstraction. The divine agent-self must then be pictured as operating its agency in such a community, where God's selfhood is individuated as it encounters other selves with their own agency. Theological positions which refuse to take such a notion seriously therefore abrogate the concept of action which they seek to use. Once God becomes, in effect, the solo-agent - whose agency is on a different plane to all other agencies - it becomes impossible to sustain God's own agency. Such a threat comes from different places of course, though in the end they amount to the same thing, Just as there is little difference to life under extreme regimes of Left or Right, so life under Pantheism and Pre destinarianism or any other form of divine totalitarianism has the same flavour. But the use of the concept of action in such systems is a deceit if Macmurray's analysis has anything to be said for it. And once the com? munity of agents is allowed, God's action immediately becomes vulnerable. In being truly 'action', God's action becomes vulnerable if not to unsound judgements or the failure to identify proper parameters, then to forces (agents) not fully within his control. 1 Ibid. p. 140. 2 Ibid. p. 145.</page><page sequence="4">228 ROBERT ELLIS 2. ACTION AS 'TRYING TO ACT' The distinction between an 'act' and an 'event' is a commonplace to those who have studied the theory of action. All changes are acts or events. In an act I (or some other agent) do something, and in an event something happens to me, or 'just happens'. When I strike a gong, I move and act; when I am struck by an uppercut to the jaw and fall to the ground, I am moved but I do not act. The term ' reflex action ' is highly misleading by these standards, for action is only intelligible as something denoted by intention. Often one may distinguish between an act and an event by examining the mood of the verb used in describing such occurrences: an active verb often points to action, a passive to an event. Jennifer Hornsby uses a more discerning linguistic tool in her analysis. Words like, for instance, 'move' belong to a class of English verbs which can occur both transitively and intransitively. If I meltT the chocolate, then the chocolate meltedj. If I moveT my body, then my body movedx. Hornsby's case is that an action is a movementT, but never a movement^ Of course we normally speak in such a way as to imply that movementsT cause move mentSj. Thus we may argue that all actions are movementsT, and all move men tsT occur inside the body. Its often possible to answer the question 'what did he do?' by describing some bodily movementT. And actions that are not bodily movementsT, like standing to attention or doing a sum in your head, can also be spoken of in this way.1 Hornsby goes on to characterize every action as 'an event of trying or attempting to act'.2 Trying to act is intentionally acting, though not all tryings reach the 'surface of the body'.3 Whereas we usually only say 'he tried to *' if there is an element of doubt or denial in our report, Hornsby thinks that success is a sufficient condition for the term's usage. Agents try to do something in every case where they set out to do it and succeed. A fine distinction is required between the old ' Cartesian ' view which says that actions are caused by volitions or conations (which involves us in an infinite regress), and this view that actions are conations. To see an action as a trying to act does at least two things. It underlies the centrality of intention: trying to act and intending to act are quite close. But it also hints again at the element of risk which we exposed as integral to action in our first section. Stuart Hampshire says: 'Within the concept of action lies the distinction between an attempt and an achievement? One cannot fail to intend to do something. One can only fail to do something.'4 To try to act in some way is sometimes actually to act in another. Hornsby gives the example of a tennis player who tries to return service but strikes the ball into the net. 1 Jennifer Hornsby, Actions (Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1980), ch 1. 2 Ibid. p. 33. 3 Ibid. p. 34. 4 Stuart Hampshire, Thought and Action (Chatto &amp; Windus, London, 1959), pp. 170 fo, i82f.</page><page sequence="5">THE VULNERABILITY OF ACTION 229 One thing she did was try to hit the ball, and another thing she did was hit it into the net. But it is not that one has to do first the one thing and then the other in such cases; that having tried to hit the ball over the net (having had a shot at it), one then has to mitigate one's failure to get it over the net by now hitting it into the net. An inept attempt is enough to hit it into the net. One's trying to return it is one's hitting it into the net.... If someone's trying to hit the ball somewhere can be the same as his hitting it elsewhere, then his actually hitting it where he meant to could scarcely be different from his trying to hit it there_His attempt is then a success.1 It has been argued, here I think particularly of Sir Malcolm Knox, that whatever we really attend we achieve - that trying always succeeds. What? ever we fail to achieve is not a 'real' intention suited to our objective situation, or just a pipe-dream or ineffectual wish.2 This is a helpful re? minder so far as it indicates that realistic intention aims only at what is genuinely within reach. But to suggest that we are omnicompetent in real? izing our intentions is dangerous and misleading. I may intend to catch a bus, or return a library book; that I fail does not mean that either was impossible, or that my intention was insincere. It may have been possible for me to return the ball over the net, yet my intention can be woefully un? fulfilled. When one thinks of such unfulfilled intentions it is perhaps easier to get a feel for Hornsby's claim that a more basic description of action is in terms of trying. Some intentions, tryings, never reach the ' surface of the body' in her phrase - remain dormant, or are abandoned. Others simply fail to reach their objective, due to many conflicting factors, and possibly to the intention itself. Hampshire says that a mental act (may we say, an act which does not reach the surface of the body because of its nature or its failure) relates to a ' full act ' like a shadow which remains when the public aspect of an action is inhibited.3 Hornsby affirms that all actions are tryings, but that not all tryings are actions.4 One of the problems with such a conception lies in the greater difficulty now encountered in the process of verification : of ascertaining whether an agent really did act, or try to act. Clearly someone can try to act without any observable verification being possible. More tellingly, Hornsby does not give us convincing enough answers when probed in one of the theory's grey areas : at what point does one say that a trying (as in the tennis example) is an action, and where it is not? what criteria exactly are used? There is another major qualification which must be laid on the argument before it can justifiably be used for our purpose. Even if one accepts that it is legitimate to define action as trying to act it must also be recognized that the definition of ' trying' at this point does not make the importing of'failing 1 Hornsby, op. cit. p. 38. 2 Action (George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, 1968). 3 Hampshire, op. cit. pp. 163fr. 4 Hornsby, op. cit. p. 42.</page><page sequence="6">23O ROBERT ELLIS to act' a logical neccessity, nor even a practical inevitability. That is to say that even if we characterize God's actions as his ' tryings to act ' that does not now mean that we have therefore established that some of these tryings will, by nature of the case, fail. It may be logically possible to argue that God always tries to act and always succeeds in achieving what he tries to do. There is nothing inherent in the concept, as there seemed to be in our first section when approaching the question from a different angle, which dictates this conclusion. Rather, insofar as this redefinition of action as trying to act contributes to our discussion, it does so by introducing a greater tentativeness of tone which may reinforce the other arguments used. Here we are content to state that God tries to act when he acts. The question 'does God always succeed when he tries to act?' must be answered separately. We will answer to that question 'Yes, and No', as our final section will endeavour to explain. 3. BASIC AND COMPLEX ACTIONS The idea of'basic actions' was first mooted by Arthur Danto. He contended that there are some things that an agent does which do not first require him to do anything else; other acts, however, require another 'doing' for them to be done. If an agent performs a basic action he performs nothing first that causes it to happen.1 Hornsby has refined this notion, distinguishing two types of basicness : causal and teleological. Two examples throw the issues into relief. I might (intentionally or not) cause myself to write to a friend by summoning up an image of him. This causes my writing the letter. Summoning the image is 'more basic' than writing the letter. But when I enter a dark room and put on the lights we do not say that I cause myself (intentionally or not) to turn on the light by flicking the switch. From this Hornsby adduces not two but three types of basicness : causal (where one action depends causally upon another), preparatory (where two actions are related not causally, but where one is done in preparation for another - e.g. I get out my key in order to open the door), and compositional (an action may be composed of parts which are in turn actions - to make a cake I perform a series of acts first). Thus Hornsby 'splits' the teleological type into two kinds. This more sophisticated theory hinges upon the way in which one action can be described in different ways, like one act being both flicking a switch and turning on the lights. The celebrated example of this is Anscombe's instance of the man who pumps water into a house where a group of Nazis are staying, the water having been 'laced' with slow-acting poison. What is he doing? He is (A) moving his arm; (B) operating the pump; (C) replen? ishing the water supply; and (D) poisoning the Nazis. All descriptions are 1 Arthur C. Danto, 'Basic Actions', in The Philosophy of Action (O.U.P., Oxford, 1968), ed. Alan R. White.</page><page sequence="7">THE VULNERABILITY OF ACTION 23I correct, and each action is intentional - though someone may only be intend? ing A-C. The fullest account or description is found at the end of the sequence - D. This intention 'swallows up' previous ones. The pumper is only doing one thing, not four. ' Moving his arm ' is what Hornsby describes as causally basic.1 What of the teleological types? Something that we do may be one discreet act, and yet be involved in a succession of doings or acts - sub-acts, if you like.2 Very often such a complex action will be made yet more complex by interaction with other entities and agents. The more complex an action is, in this sense - i.e. the more other agents are involved - the more the risk of failure increases. Allow an illustration. (i) I resolve to sit down. This act involves myself and a chair. It is relatively simple and the number of things that can go wrong are limited. I may break my leg, or slip, or the chair may be too flimsy to take my weight, but normally the risk in minimal, (ii) I may resolve to teach my dog to sit down on the command ' sit ! ' The action of teaching my dog to sit is more complex than my sitting. Dogs have limited freedom and a certain 'personality' (if you will allow a common anthropomorphism!). In the park I must contend with the elements, and with other dogs distracting Fido from his classes. But, if I have the requisite skill, and if my dog has more or less average propensity for training and discipline, I should succeed, (iii) I may resolve to persuade my wife to teach my dog to sit down on the command ' sit ! ' My wife will encounter all the problems mentioned above in the park, but there is the prior problem of my persauding her to do it. She may be scared of dogs, or agoraphobic, or busy, or uncertain of technique - she may of course, just not want to do it. Each time a new element is introduced the action becomes more complex and more risky. The more free human agents are involved, the greater the risk. The illustration just offered not only shows the nature of increasing complexity, it also hints at another important fact about our use of the concept of agency. We often speak of one person acting through another person or many others. That is, A performs/? through the agency of B. In one sense p is B's act, but we usually think of it being much more A's. So when I buy a book for my wife's birthday, I make the purchase by giving a friend specific instructions, and some money and sending him to Blackwell's. In the way we 1 G. E. M. Anscombe, Intention (Blackwell, Oxford, 1957), pp. 34ff. et al. 2 Macmurray, The Self as Agent, p. 89. See also Gordon D. Kaufman, God the Problem (Harvard U.P., Cambridge, Mass., 1972), ch 6. By 'complex act' we mean an act which is not 'basic' but has component parts - one of which may be basic. Thus 'renegotiating EEC terms' is a complex act because it is a series of actions (with a variety of agents) - issuing from the more basic act of ' briefing ' by Mrs Thatcher. Normally this label 'complex' will apply to these teleological (whether preparatory or compositional or both) categories of act, though it may be used of the 'causal' too. A complex act, of either type, is capable of a variety of descriptions. A 'simple' act is perhaps the proper opposite of'complex'. The terms may not be strictly used and are relative. Mrs Thatcher's basic act is her initial one ; an official's simple act is, perhaps, his compiling a document for the case ; the complex act is Mrs Thatcher's whole renegotiation. Simple acts are sometimes 'sub-acts' when related to the complex whole, but they are always discrete.</page><page sequence="8">232 ROBERT ELLIS talk of Mrs Thatcher renegotiating our EEC terms of entry, even though we know very well that the actual bargaining was done by officials and other ministers. The officials remain resposible for the settlement in a real way (as my friend is responsible for his purchase), but we still call it Mrs Thatcher's triumph - or otherwise. Indeed we often only talk of the responsibility of the negotiators, or of my friend, when they botch up their part in the pro? ceedings: the success is our credit, as the initiators, but the failure is their fault assuming our instructions were realistic and correct. It is J. R. Lucas who points out that, outside philosophy textbooks, the word 'agent' is commonly reserved for one who acts on behalf of another. In terms of the basic/complex distinction, Mrs Thatcher's basic act is the briefing of officials, her complex act is the renegotiating of EEC terms. Feinberg suggests, I think correctly, that to be responsible for one's own complex actions is to have one's simpler actions identified as the cause of an upshot; to be responsible for one's simpler actions is only to be properly identifiable as their doer.1 Of course this definition can only be a rule of thumb, further elaboration is required in cases of failure and of unwarranted success. Our simple, or basic actions, can almost always be subsumed in another complex action, which fact often makes the individuation of actions some? what difficult. But as we see our actions possessing continuity, and inter relatedness, we see how our lives can be understood as having a trajectory given through our intentional action. This classic basic/complex distinction can be applied to God's action in an illuminating way. Some though may dispute that we can properly speak of God's complex actions at all. If we limit 'basic' action to action upon/within one's body then God's immediate action upon the physical universe may qualify under such a description whether or not one holds to a view of the world as the body of God. The looser 'simple' acts and more far-reaching 'complex' acts may be ruled out in God's case because he is related with equal immediacy to all parts of the universe. Thus when I try to achieve a complex action, like building a motorway or obtaining world peace, I must involve other agents even though the 'plan' and so the action might be ' mine '. But God is related to all agents. My complex act is comprised perhaps of a few which might be called ' basic ' and many which might be called 'simple', but all God's actions would seem to be 'basic'. However, it is possible still to speak of God's simple and complex actions without departing very far from our normal usage of the terms. To do so will help us see once more how the way in which we form and use the concept of action takes for granted the risk of failure. Those who speak of God as active agent are often unafraid to use some characteristically uncontroversial examples of his active agency. We might 1 Joel Feinberg, 'Action and Responsibility', in ed. Alan R. White, op. cit.</page><page sequence="9">THE VULNERABILITY OF ACTION 233 say for instance that 'God loves me', perhaps as a minister I have said 'God called me', and we might pray 'Lord, renew your Church!' God's act of loving me is a basic action. He tries to love and always succeeds. He cannot fail to love me if he decides to do so. My reception of that love is another question. He need do nothing else to love, he just does it. Basic action. Similarly, he cannot fail to call me, if he decides to do so. It would be once more a basic action - and in his basic actions, God succeeds whenever he tries to act. If I respond to that call then I am called to the ministry and that action has a further element. It takes shape in the world - gets beyond the 'surface of the body'. My compliance makes the act concrete. Perhaps this is a 'simple' action. In order to renew the church more wills must be called into compliance with the divine will - the act is infinitely more complex. This congregation or that experiences renewal, though often even then in frag? mentary ways. Even though God acts on each will basically (in the technical sense here used) he must perform a great many such basic acts to achieve his overall aim. This is an example of compositional teleological basicness of which Hornsby speaks. Each basic action is bound to succeed. He will try to call and influence so-and-so. Insofar as his agency is effective his simple acts take shape as part of his overall purpose. But the whole complex action of renewal is much more risky and fragile, just as our own actions inevitably bear risk as they become more complex. This paper, for all its imperfections, is incomplete in one important respect. I would wish to show how the notions of actions fit in with a Whiteheadian (not Hartshornian) model of process thought. For the whole edifice is based upon the fact of action, and his theory can be interpreted so as to yield an illuminating account of God's action by using some of the concepts which we have examined. However that is not possible - this paper is already rather long as 'short contributions' go. It has endeavoured to show that the vul? nerability of action does not depend on who the agent is, but that it is ' written in' to certain aspects of the concept of action itself. If the argument is found convincing it leaves two options. Either we must use the concept of action when applied to God much more carefully, and with due respect for its proper components; or else we must abandon the model if it forbids us from delineating the relationship between God and the world which on other grounds we find convincing. Both courses may prove, for many, traumatic. Bletchley, Milton Keynes England</page></plain_text>
