For once when I had captured a drone, and squeezed its middle with my finger and nail, to see if it emitted some kind of a sting, the body broke, and there suddenly emerged out of the skin of the bottom half a skilfully formed white or yellow head of an ox, with spread out, twisting horns and a muzzle bent inwards. People came to admire this thing exceedingly, and for this reason entreated me to test it out again another time, for which reason I squeezed a further five drones in turn, and as before the same head of an ox always emerged. So through the drones, Nature (which rightly takes great care over the bee), reveals wonderfully in this portent their origins and in what way lost bees should be at last restored.1 Thus the Bolognese polymath and naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi, behaving like a model practitioner of early modern scientific enquiry, records his direct observation of nature, repeating the experiment publicly to verify its results. But those results demonstrated to him indirectly - through a belief in natural correspondences which William B. Ashworth has described as an 'emblematic world view' characteristic of Renaissance natural history - the veracity of one I am grateful to audiences at the Warburg Institute, Sussex University, and the Sixteenth Century Studies Conference in Atlanta for response to versions of this article.

The modern study of Renaissance zoology lags behind the study of Renaissance botany, but in this it mirrors its Renaissance predecessor: Brian Ogilvie has argued that an entirely new academic discipline of natural history was created in the sixteenth century, but largely out of the study of plants.3 Notwithstand ing an ancient heritage that bequeathed major texts in both camps, plants, for obvious reasons, were easier to cultivate, collect and observe systematically. Furthermore, their investigation was more directly linked to medicine than that of animals, and thus had a practical dimension which brought with it prestige and institutional support. Finally, a very long tradition of moraliza tion of animals perhaps exerted a certain resistance to looking at them in new ways. The lessons they had to teach about human society and ethics were - and are - simply too important to be ignored.4 In investigating as a case study some aspects of the human relationship to honeybees from the late fifteenth to the early seventeenth centuries, this essay testifies to a richly symbolic and increas ingly elaborate Renaissance approach to the natural world, which related in significant ways to wider ideas about religion, politics and gender. It tells us something about what people thought made them human and how they identified with the world around them. Inevitably the isolation of one animal such as the bee cannot give us a full picture; but, in the spirit of an emerging historiography of Renaissance animal studies, it has the advantage of forcing the enquiry to visit a wide variety of places and contexts, and to cut across popular and learned writings as well as modern disciplinary boundaries.5 Furthermore, bees occupied their own special and revealing place in the Renaissance economy of nature, which makes them a rewarding subject of study in their own right.

Their impact on human development has been incalculable. They are likely to outlive us. This in itself is justification enough for investigating Renaissance attitudes towards them. THE ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL BACKGROUND Both the ancientJudaeo-Christian and the Greek and Roman heritage empha sized the special nature of bees, suggesting in different ways that they were comparable to humans. Many elements in these traditions can be identihed directly in Renaissance ideas about bees. Aristotle calls them a 'peculiar and extraordinary kind of animal' comparable to humans (as well as to wasps, ants and cranes) in being social and gregarious.' In the Politics he claims that humans, because they are endowed with speech and an ethical sense, are political animals in a way that bees are not, but it is revealing that among the gregarious animals he chooses the example of bees for making this distinc tion.8 Pliny the Elder on the other hand regards them as excelling humans in their rationality because of their complete identification with the common interest.9 Other ancient writers, notably Virgil, Varro, Columella, and Aelian, write with wonder about bees' intensively organized society, industry, produc tivity, military prowess, and the division of labour within the hive.10 These writers, and Virgil especially, exercised a huge influence. Medieval and Renais sance authors often continue to consider bees the most outstanding of all animals, or like the Elizabethan naturalist Thomas Moffet and Ulisse Aldro vandi (both following Pliny), at least the most noble of the insects.11 According to Moffet, bees must partake of 'divine understanding and heavenly wisdome', for 'Who I say will deny them to have fantasie, memory and some kind of reason?'12 The accretion of mythological stories about bees - for example, 6 Eric Hoyt and Ted Schultz, Insect Lives: Stories of Mystery and Romance from a Hidden World (Edinburgh and London: Mainstream Publishing, 1999), 9-11.

According to Falcone the bee is greater than all the other animals in virtue.14 The Hebrew Bible distinguishes between ants, described as a mere 'people', and bees, described as a more sophisticated 'congregation' or 'community'.15 Biblical and patristic texts exhort humans to take these creatures as their model.16 In the writings of Jerome and Augustine, bees and honey are symbols of Christ and the church. Origen describes Christ as king of all the bees. In Cyprian and especially Ambrose, bees, because of their miraculous combina tion of fecundity and chastity (of which more below), are a symbol of virginity and hence of the Virgin Mary.17 By the twelfth and thirteenth centuries beehives were also being compared to monastic communities and bees with monks, as in Alexander Neckham's De naturis rerum,18 This idea receives its most developed form in the work of the Dominican Thomas of Cantimpré, entitled Bonum universale de apibus, written between 1256 and 1263. His book enjoyed various printings in the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, including Cologne in about 1480, Paris in 1516, and Douai in 1597, 1605 and in 1627, the last clearly related to the election of Pope Urban VIII four years previously - the emblem of Urban's family, the Barberini, displayed three bees and his election as pope initiated the widespread appearance of apian metaphors and 13 François Quiviger, 'Honey from Heaven: Aspects of the Topos of the Bees in Renaissance Artistic Litera ture', in Ulrich Pfisterer and Max Seidel (eds.), Visuelle Topoi: Erfindung und tradiertes Wissen in den Künsten der italienischen Renaissance (München: Deutscher Kunstverlag, 2003), 317-21.

In an extended work of moralization Thomas represents the life of bees as a model for humanity, for the church and for the monastic community, emphasizing qualities such as community, discipline, labour, probity and chastity.20 Such ideas are found elsewhere in the sixteenth century, for example in Agostino Gallo's claim, in a frequently reprinted agricultural manual first published in 1569, that 'divine' bees are virgins whose beehives, though presided over by a king, might otherwise be com pared to a convent of holy nuns. (It may not be irrelevant that Gallo was a friend of Angela Merici, founder of the Ursuline order.) The same observa tion is made in the Spanish writer Gabriel Alonzo de Herrera's Agricultura general, which enjoyed numerous reprintings in Italian translation in the sixteenth century.21 Gallo's insistence that bees are presided over by a single male ruler, even when his analogy with nuns might have led him to suggest otherwise, is typical of the Renaissance view and ultimately derives from ancient tradition. Although Aristotle considers the possibility that the ruling bee and the worker bees might be female and the drones male, reporting that some people call the rulers 'mothers', he decisively rejects this idea with the comment that 'it is unreasonable to suppose that the bees are female and the drones male, for nature does not give weapons for fighting to any female, and while the drones are stingless all the bees have a sting'.22 Despite the overwhelming influence of this statement, the view that the ruler was female seems never to have died out entirely. There is evidence that the Anglo-Saxons called the ruling bee a 'mother',23 and in the eleventh century Leofric Missal, the blessing of the candle on Easter Saturday tellingly reads, 'O truly blessed and miraculous bee, whose virginity neither males violate nor offspring shatter nor does motherhood impair your chastity. So the holy Mary conceived as a virgin, as a virgin she gave birth and remained a virgin.'24 The patristic equation between apian virginity and the Virgin Mary 19 See for examples, Irving Laven, 'Bernini's Bumbling Barberini Bees', in Joseph Imorde, Fritz Neumayer and Tristan Weddingan (eds.), Baroche Inszenierung (Emsdetten: Edition Imorde, 1999), 50-71 and Howard McP.

It seems to have lived on among some apiculturalists and in folk tradition in a way that, to the historian looking exclusively at written texts, is likely to seem subterranean. Among printed works on bees dating to the sixteenth century, it is only in the Spanish treatise of Luis Mendez de Torres of 1586 that the ruling bee is taken to be female, with the observation that although some people call it a king (Rey), others describe it as a 'Mistress' (Maestra).25 Interestingly de Torres avoids the word 'reina' (queen), as if hesitant to lend a female ruler all the weight of human sovereignty, empha sizing rather in his subsequent discussion the role of a mother. De Torres' understanding of apian gender is not declared as a discovery or given particu lar significance, thus suggesting that he was drawing on existing Spanish traditions based on actual beekeeping practice.26 This point underlines the fact that an exceptional quantity of knowledge about bees derived not from ancient writings but from the very widespread and ancient practice of apiculture itself, which required close attention to the seasonal changes in the behaviour of the hive.27 Though not tame or domestic animals, honeybees were kept very much in the territory of cultivated nature, for example in the grounds of the villa, country house, abbey or monastery. They formed a part both of untamed nature and of a human agricultural and economic order. They ruled over themselves and were self-sufficient and yet could be exploited by humans for honey, with its alimentary and medicinal properties, and wax, which combined practical and liturgical uses. Indeed for all these reasons bees were often classified as occupying an indeterminate position between tame and wild nature.28 Among early modern writings on bees, it is the apicultural manuals, either published autonomously or forming parts of larger works on agriculture, that were printed most frequently.29 On the other hand, in reviewing Renaissance attitudes to bees, we must also not lose sight of a larger ethical framework that derives from theology and philosophy. Animals in general were obviously distinct from humans in philo sophical terms because of a superior range of possible attributes or capacities uniquely possessed by humans, above all rational souls and thus the capacity both for rational thought and for speech. Partly for this reason animals were frequently seen to have been created expressly for human use and gratifica tion (and bee colonies were often killed in order to access honey or improve 25 Luis Mendez de Torres, Tradado breve de la cultivacion y cura de las colmenas, y assimesmo las ordenanças de los colmenares.

For England see Prete, 'Can Females Rule the Hive?'</page><page sequence="7">The Renaissance of bees 287 its production with this justification).30 However, this essential difference between humans and animals - a difference that has been decisively recon figured in our post-Darwinian times - opened up space for powerful analogies and correspondences between the two groups. As products of God's creation, animals' modes of behaviour might be a reflection of divine purposes: humans may be able to learn about such purposes by studying the book of nature. In particular, comparison with apparently inferior creatures might provide an emphatic demonstration of how far short human behaviour falls of human or divine ideals and standards. Thus even some of the most scholarly treatments of animals, for example Theodore Gaza's Latin translations of Aristotle's animal books of around 1458, which rapidly became the standard way to read Aristotle's influential zoology in Latin, are justified by reference to their ethical utility. In the case of Gaza as in the case of so many others, this includes a nod to the lessons that humans can learn from bees in particular.31 Nature, according to Sir Thomas Elyot in The Boke named the Governor of 1531, has left to mankind in the bees 'a perpetual figure of a just governance or rule'.32 'The most high God', commented Thomas Moffet, 'did create all other creatures for our use; so especially the Bees, . . . that as mistresses they might hold forth to us a pattern of Politick and Oeconomick virtues.'33 POLITICS AND GENDER Primary among such political virtues was male rulership; the justification and celebration of human kingship in turn sustained the belief in a ruling male bee. Still, political interpretations of bee life were more wide-ranging than this alone suggests. Even an example that otherwise meets our expectations of natural analogies in the early modern period, that is, that they will be deployed to emphasize order, hierarchy and obedience, tells through omis sion a more complicated story.34 In 1517, Bishop Richard Fox of Winchester founded a college in Oxford intended for the training and education of secular priests, Corpus Christi College. Best known today for its role in introducing humanistic studies to sixteenth-century Oxford, the college is also notable for its statutes, written by the founder, in which an extended bee metaphor is used to describe the 30 Keith Thomas, Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England, 1500-1800 (London: Allen Lane, 1983), 17-50. See for examples John Levett, The Ordering of Bees (1634), 41; Prete, 'Can Females Rule the Hive?', 120; Preston, Bee, 37-8. See Stefano Perfetti, Aristotle's Zoology and its Renaissance Commentators (1521-1601) (Leuven: Leuven University Press, 2000), 19-21. 32 Thomas Elyot, The Boke named the Governor (1531), sigs.

See also Prete, 'Can Females Rule the Hive?', 119.</page><page sequence="8">288 Jonathan Woolfson institution and its members.35 In these statutes Fox claims that he has founded a 'beehive' in which the students, 'like ingenious bees', will 'make wax for the honour of God and honey for the profit of themselves and all Christians'. He describes the newly instituted public lecturers in theology, Greek and humanity as 'herbalists' who 'shall plant and sow the best shrubs and herbs so that the bees, swarming from the entire University of Oxford, may extract and suck from it matter to convert into nourishment for them selves and for the honour of all Britain'. The statutes are characterized by authoritarianism and repressiveness: the president of Corpus is to be 'feared like a prince'; students swear an oath of obedience in which they solemnly promise to undergo all punishments meted out to them without a murmur of complaint; corporal and other punishments are listed in detail; and the apian metaphor features in this context as well, for Fox notes that when the president of the college dies 'the whole swarm is bewildered, not knowing whom to obey' and he remarks that 'it is fair that the gluttonous and useless drone should be driven away from the hive, lest he devour the food of the honey-making and working bee'. It thus appears that the disciplinarian environment of this devout institu tion was being offered rhetorical sanction by the precedent of divinely created nature. Yet in terms of extended uses of apian metaphors, the Corpus statutes are unusual, because one of the most significant ancient, medieval and Renaissance beliefs about the king bee, not mentioned by Fox, is that he either does not have a sting or does not use his sting. From Seneca's De clementia onwards, rulers were for this reason exhorted through the example of the king bee to balance justice with mercy, charity and clemency.36 In the sixteenth century this became a prominent theme in the emblem tradition: one of the bee emblems of the pioneering Italian emblematist Andrea Alciati carries the motto 'principis dementia' (the clemency of the prince).37 The warlike King Louis XII of France replaced the emblem of a porcupine in the early 1500s with that of bees in order to stress his newly benevolent and merciful kingship: bees continued to be a symbol of the French monarchy into the eighteenth century.38 In the Flo rentine Giovanni Rucellai's poem of Virgilian inspiration, Le api, written in 1524 and first printed in 1539, the pope is compared to a king bee and the name of Rucellai's patron, Pope Clement VII, is taken as an indication of his 35 For more detailed discussion see my 'Bishop Fox's Bees and the Early English Renaissance', Reformation and Renaissance Review, 5 (2003), 7-26. 36 Seneca, De clementia, XIX. 37 Andrea Alciati, Emblemata (1531).

Although ancient and medieval writers disagree as to whether the king bee has a sting,42 by the Renaissance period the consensus seems to have favoured the view that the king has a sting that is not used.43 After all, a ruling bee without a sting may be a clement and merciful king, but on the other hand he might also be an emasculated king or not a king at all but a queen: in order for the moral about the clemency of male rulers to function at its best, the king bee needs to have a sting which he chooses not to use.44 It is clear that Bishop Fox does not mention this element of the metaphor because he does not want to restrain the Corpus president from deploying his disciplinarian sting, the rod. Besides the emphasis on kingly clemency, political uses of the bee metaphor could also focus on other desirable aspects of the exercise of power.

This is one of the meanings of the frieze depicting bees on the front of the Medici villa at Poggio a Caiano dating to the end of the fifteenth century.45 Bee emblems were used by the Medici as both unofficial and official rulers of Florence in a variety of contexts in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.46 In the medieval bestiary tradition the emphasis had been on the communal organization of life within the hive, and on the combination of fierce loyalty to a king and the liberty derived from the king's merciful behaviour. The stan dard version claimed that, 'Although subject to a king, bees are nonetheless free'.47 This emphasis on liberty made its way into several texts in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with the argument that the monarch is elected by the entire apian community and rules in an authoritarian manner only through the universal consent of his subjects. The Florentine patrician Luigi Guicciardini, in his 'Dialogue of Bees and Spiders' dating to about 1529, comments that in his opinion past writers on bees have not sufficiently praised the prudence and judgement with which bees elect their king, subsequently killing the other candidates so as to curb potential threats to future unity and communal wellbeing.48 According to Thomas Moffet, 'Bees are swayed by soverainty, not tyranny, neither do they admit of a King properly so called, by succession or lot, but by due advice, and circumspect choice; and though they willingly submit to regall authority; yet so, as they retain their liberty; because they still keep their Prerogative of Election; and when their King is once made sure to them by oath, they do in a principal manner love him.'49 If, for example, in Giuseppe Falcone's guide to villa life, the king bee fails to rule in the interest of the entire apian community, he is killed by the other bees who elect and crown a successor.50 This consensual, perhaps even republican, tendency is also found in Gio vanni Bonifacio's La repubblica delle api, con la quale si dimostra il modo di ben 45 See Janet Cox-Rearick, 'Themes of Time and Rule at Poggio a Caiano: The Portico Frieze of Lorenzo il Magnifico', Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorischen Instituts in Florenz, 26 (1982), 167-210. 46 For manuscript decoration see for example Anna Lenzuini (ed.), All'ombra del lauro: documenti librari della cultura in età laurenziana (Firenze: Silvana, 1992), 129 and 136.

In the following year Bonifacio expanded this argument in his L'arti liberali et mecaniche, come siano state da gli animait irrationali a gli huomini dimos trate. According to this work, it is the cock and the lion that provide lessons in monarchy and the crane in aristocracy, whereas bees teach democracy.51 If bees were used to justify and celebrate human forms of political organi zation, the ethical imperative meant also that they could be used to criticize human monarchy in practice: thus it is in the context of writing about apian government that Aldrovandi notes laconically that only humans, alas, in their corruption, are ruled over by tyrants.52 Notwithstanding his preference, ulti mately, for spiders, Luigi Guicciardini's discussion of the good order conse quent upon the prudent election of the king bee leads him into a long digression about the incredible cruelty, violence, indeed bestiality of humans. Humans, according to Guicciardini, are unique in their brutality and selfish ness not only against other humans but, notably, against animals, who are habitually pursued, tricked, persecuted and killed for merely gratuitous satis factions.53 After describing the king bee - merciful, peace-loving and slow to anger - Thomas Moffet likewise strikes out against humans: 'Who would not then utterly abhorre the Dionysses Tyrants in Sicily, Clearchus in Heraclea, Apollodorus the Cassandrian Robber? Who would not detest the villany of those close Parasites to Kings, who affirm that Monarchy is no other, but the means how to accomplish or satisfie the will, and a device how to maintain lust? That which ought to be far from a vertuous Prince, lest while he would seem to be a man, he betray himself to be worse than these little winged beasts.'54 REFORMATION POLEMIC Where religious debate in the era of the Reformation discusses the case of bees, it inevitably draws on secular conceptions and applies them to papal monarchy. Thomas Aquinas had argued that the superiority of monarchy is proven by the fact that 'Even among bees there is one king, and in the whole universe there is one God, creator and ruler of all.'50 From Dante's compari son of angels and bees in the Divine Comedy, his late fifteenth-century Floren tine commentator Cristoforo Fandino was able to suggest a comparison 51 Giovanni Bonifacio, L'arti liberali et mecaniche, come siano state da gli animali irrationali a gli huomini dimostrate (Rovigo, 1628), 55-63. 52 Aldrovandi, De animalibus insectis, 29.

It was not a long step from such ideas to the defence of divinely ordained papal monarchy in the context of the early Reformation. Thus Johann Eck mentions the case of apian monarchy in his major defence of papal primacy against Luther, De primatu Petri of 1521.5' John Calvin in his Institutes, on the other hand, probably responding to this work in particular although he does not cite it explicitly, argues that the case of bees can hardly be used to justify papal monarchy, since it is not as if all the bees in the world have or elect a single king, but rather that each individual king rules over his hive. He concludes that bees teach rather the primacy of bishops in individual churches or dioceses rather than the primacy of one figure for the universal church as a whole; it is interesting to note that Calvin had earlier published a commentary of Seneca's De clementia, with its observation about the mercy of human kings in relation to the king bee.58 Cardinal Roberto Bellarmino, in his authoritative and comprehensive defence of the Catholic church first published in 1590, Disputationum de controversiis Christianaefidei, replied to Calvin's argument by pointing out that, on the contrary, it is the entire church that is to be compared to one single beehive. Taking the analogy in a less rigid sense than Calvin, Bellarmino points out that it is obviously not in their nature for all bees in the world to be ruled over by one king, but still the fact that each group has a single ruler is a sufficient illustration of the naturalness of rule of the one.59 Bellarmino's view on bees and papal monarchy was in turn challenged in the writings of the Dutch Calvinist nobleman Philips van Marnix. In his attack on Bellarmino of 1603 he argues that Bellarmino's reply to Calvin amounts to a rejection of the comparison altogether. For Marnix, what is more to the point is that most animals have no form of rule at all, neither monarchical nor democratic, although they are all God's creatures, and he cites as examples lions, wolves, leopards, fishes and birds. Meanwhile, some creatures, such as the elephant or the ant, embrace democracy rather than monarchy. And those other animals that do seem to endorse monarchy, such as sheep, cows, horses, asses and oxen, do not have a monarch from their own species but rather a human ruler. The argument here is that a broader consideration of animals leaves apian and human monarchy (including papal monarchy) as the anomalous phenomena.60 Surely much more effective in its time as an attack both on the papacy and on the positive comparison with bees was Marnix's earlier satirical work, De Byencorf der Roomsche Kercke of 1569, issued under the pseudonym Isaac Rabboteno. The work was reprinted several times in the original Dutch and 56 Cristoforo Landino, Comento sopra la Comedia, ed.

Prefaced to Marnix's comprehensive refutation of Hervet is a satirical account of the church written in the form of a work of natural history. First and foremost this work represents an attack on the church and the papacy, which operates partly by making these entities look ridiculous by using their own analogies against them. More broadly it may be taken as an attack on arguments from nature generally, indeed, even as a kind of spoof of the genre of natural history writing. The work achieves these things through its mock serious tone. In the dedicatory letter to Franciscus Sonnius, bishop of 's-Hertogenbosch, Marnix claims that his work is called the beehive because Catholics justify their religious practises by reference to a wide range of sources rather than one single source such as the Bible. In this they are to be compared to bees who gather their honey from a range of different flowers. This is a typical example of how Marnix subverts the metaphor: bees were usually to be admired and imitated for gathering from a range of different flowers;62 here this quality is used to attack their human counterparts on a notorious issue of Reformation polemic. Marnix goes on to discuss the means of constructing the hive, the origins of bees in myth and scholarly opinion, different kinds of bees, their means of reproduction, their political organization, burials, their work, diseases, prod ucts and death. Throughout he quotes Aristotle, Pliny and other ancient authorities and quite often stays close to them. However, his different kinds of bees are monks, bishops, inquisitors, abbots, priors, and mendicant friars (the drones). Like the pope, his king bee wears a triple crown; his bees' honey is poisonous and stinks of Romish decrees and decretals; the hive is constructed with the wick of Louvain and Paris, bound with Jewish and Talmudic cables, and lined with Jews' lime. Bees are deprecatingly described as somewhat effeminate (Fig. 1). Comparisons with animals could work both ways. There had long been a minor negative tradition that deprecated both bees and the humans associ ated with them. In patristic and medieval interpretation, in turn drawing on the Bible, the sting of the bees is associated with the warlike Assyrians;63 honey seduces the bees' enemies, enabling the bees treacherously to destroy them with their stings; Christ's persecutors during his Passion are compared to 61 The Beehive of the Romishe Church, trans. George Gilpin (London, 1579). For a general discussion of the work see F. E.

The effect is to reduce bees to the status of other, lesser animals, and in so doing to bring down the church and papacy to the same level. By demonstrating how easily and how plausibly natural analogies can be subverted, Marnix can also be seen to raise questions about their usefulness. Some historians of science have argued that it was Calvinism that in the long term undermined the Renaissance mental world of natural correspondences and analogies; Marnix may be read as an early example of such a process.67 64 Ciccarese, Animali simbolici, 93 and 99. 65 For an example of the latter see Hassig, Medieval Bestiaries, 60. 66 For the later negative tradition see especially Preston, Bee, 137-61.

The theory that bees reproduced without the sinful pleasures of sexual inter course strengthens the perception of their sense of discipline, selflessness and their proximity to the divine, and places humans in the more beastly camp.68 The question of the generation of bees has ancient roots. Aristotle discusses the possibility of apian copulation but does not support it against other theories.69 Virgil is clear that bees do not engage in sexual intercourse but gather their young from herbs or flowers; and his fourth Géorgie reaches a climax with the spontaneous generation of bees from rotting ox carcasses. Pliny, like Aristotle, is inconclusive, commenting that 'there has been a great deal of minute enquiry among the learned as to the manner in which bees reproduce their species, for sexual intercourse among them has never been observed.'70 This point was reiterated in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Already in the thirteenth century, Thomas of Cantimpré had asked: if the male king is the father and the rest of the bees are his wives, why has nobody ever seen them engaged in sexual intercourse?71 Agostino Gallo considers the bees to be like little virgins ('virginelle'); if bees had sex someone would have seen it by now. Gallo confirms the virginity of bees by recounting that, in Verona in the 1560s, a swarm of bees made their hive between the tombs of two young virgin sisters, demonstrating bees' love of virginity; as divine crea tures bees' behaviour was particularly subject to such portentous interpreta tion.'2 Since antiquity, beekeepers had been advised to abstain from sexual intercourse days before approaching bees, which cannot bear the proximity of lecherous men (as well as of drunks, robbers and perfumed or menstruating women).73 Thomas Moffet writes, 'I am of the opinion that they are propa gated by copulation', but he reports that some people deny it because one would expect it to have been observed.74 Like Agostino Gallo, Richard Remnant in a treatise of 1637 believes the bees to be female and claims that 'they receive seed from the Drones in the summer time', but he confesses 'after what manner I cannot well tell'.75 Thus to ancient authority was added 68 On spontaneous generation of animals generally, a major issue in Renaissance natural philosophy, see Hiro Hirai, Le concept de semence dans le théories de la matière à la Renaissance de Marsile Ficin à Pierre Gassendi (Turnhout: Brepols, 2005). 69 Historia animalium, V. 21, De generatione animalim, 759. 70 Pliny, Natural History, XI. 16. 71 Thomas Cantimpratensis, De natura rerum, ed.

Ancient, medieval and early modern observers could see worker bees nurtur ing their young in the hive but could do little more than hypothesize about how they got there. Nonetheless, like the erudite Thomas Moffet, some scholarly and human istically inclined Renaissance writers did countenance the possibility of apian sex. Georgius Pictorius is confident that bees reproduce by sexual intercourse, and comments that bees are engendered, as Thomas Hyll's English translation has it, 'by the actuall doing together'.77 Ulisse Aldrovandi engages in an extraordinarily detailed and thoughtful discussion of the issue, working closely with the texts of Aristotle, Pliny, Albertus Magnus as well as his con temporaries Girolamo Cardano and Julius Caesar Scaliger.78 Nevertheless, as we have seen, he ultimately concludes by supporting Virgil's account of bees generated from rotting ox carcasses by way of the evidence of his own, quite remarkable, observation. The natural philosopher and physician Fortunio Liceti, on the other hand, writing in 1618, argues that bees reproduce by sexual intercourse,79 a view immediately refuted by Julius Caesar Baricellus in his Hortulus genialis of 1620.80 The Roman Accademia dei Lincei's studies of bees dating to 1626, Melissographia, Apes Dianiae and Apiarium, including the first printed micro scopic illustrations in history, and dedicated to Pope Urban VIII, comprise one of the most remarkable apian productions of this period, enshrining close observation in a rich framework of panegyric and symbolism (Fig. 2). But despite friendship with Liceti and the unprecedented opportunity afforded by the microscope to study bees up close, the Lincean Federico Cesi insists on the chastity of bees in Apiarium.81 This does not, however, lead him to follow what is otherwise his major source, Ulisse Aldrovandi's De animalibus insectis, as he does not even contemplate the hypothesis that bees are born from rotting animal carcasses, favouring instead the argument that they are generated from honey, stimulated by the king bee's heat.

He has many children, in fact swarms and armies of children, whom he loves intensely and sincerely, while they all compete with eachother to love him greatly. For what else is a patron, if not a father consecrated by the laws and who consecrates by means of the laws? This is the excellent rule of government and of rulership, created in the image of the superior world, so that we, sons of a great father, may always find joy in the high father, and we Romans will always find it especially in Urban.84 Despite the Linceians' revolutionary subjection of bees to microscopic exami nation, in the first half of the seventeenth century one of the most significant changes in the understanding of bees, the conclusion that the ruler is female, took place in an apicultural rather than a laboratory context; that is, in a context which allowed for examination of the living system. By close observa tion of the life cycle of the hive and of bees in their natural environment, the humble Basingstoke vicar Charles Butler, in his Feminine Monarchy of 1609, was able to deduce that the ruling bee and the worker bees were female and the drones male. This view had a clear impact on English beekeeping treatises: Richard Remnant's A discourse or historié of bees of 1637 takes for granted the fact that 'This is a feminine Monarchie, the females governe', a view that leads Remnant into a general discussion of human female rulership, both of the commonwealth and of the household, in which he nevertheless ensures that women's role is highly circumscribed: he concludes with a comparison of bees and women, intended to demonstrate how men might best rule over both.85 Butler was in part able to influence Remnant and others because he draws on the rhetoric of a self-consciously scientific age to trumpet his discovery, berat ing earlier writers on bees for reproducing others' opinions rather than observing phenomena for themselves.86 But his work also forms part of a larger early modern project to apply the lessons of classical farming to con temporary agricultural and horticultural improvement.87 In fact, like so many of his predecessors, he is thoroughly tied to a traditional vision of these creatures. He makes some simple errors by reliance on the earlier testimony which he attacks; he repeats some of the language and implausible stories to be found in the bestiary tradition, much of which was being abandoned 84 Cesi, Apiarium: 'Rex apum pater est, castusque et absque ulla venerei nexus aut plexus impuritate pater. Multos qui filios habeat, imo examina et exercitus filiorum; qui plurimum, qui syncere amet, quem certatim omnes plurimum ament. Quid vero aliud patronus, quam ipsis sanctus legibus, sanciensque Pater? Haec dominii, haec optima ad superioris mundi imaginem, princapatus ratio est; ut filii magni Patris simus, et summo semper nos patre gaudeamus, Urbani prasertim Urbano.' 85 Remnant, Discourse, 36-40. See also Merrick, 'Royal Bees', 15-17. However John Levett's The Ordering of Bees of 1634 continues to talk of a 'master bee': 31-2. 86 See especially 'The Preface to the Reader'. 87 See Joan Thirsk, 'Making a Fresh Start: Sixteenth-Century Agriculture and the Classical Inspiration', in Leslie and Raylor, Culture and Cultivation, 15-34; Andrew McRae, God Speed the Plough: the Representation of Agrarian England, 1500-1600 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), 133-228, esp. 166; Fussell, Classical Tradition, 94—113.</page><page sequence="19">The Renaissance of bees 299 elsewhere in this period; and he repeats the standard view of apian political organization: 'Bees abhor as well polyarchie as anarchie, God having showed in them unto men an expresse pattern of a perfect monarchie, the most natural and absolute form of government.'88 The ruling bee's sting is com pared to a symbolic sword.89 Bees possess valour and magnanimity, wit and dexterity, chastity and cleanliness.90 However, Butler also notes that when laying eggs the ruling bee seems to know the gender of the egg in advance of laying it, as male and female eggs are laid in cells of different sizes, a phe nomenon which has not been accounted for conclusively even today;91 he observes that drones are tolerated in the hive only during the breeding season; that an absence of drones leads to a smaller colony; that queen bees lay the eggs of both worker bees and drones. These are the most accurate observa tions of their time. Butler continues to argue that bees are chaste: it is the heat of the drones' masculine virtue that strangely enables the queen to conceive.92 Finally, he marvels at Aristotle's statement that nature does not give weapons for fighting to females, since he lived during the time of the Amazons and therefore should have known better. In fact, Aristotle's statement that healthy hives can have more than one king may indeed be explained by his interest, in his political works, in the apparent practice of multiple kingship in the Greek state of Sparta.93 Likewise, it seems possible that one of the factors that enabled Butler to make the conceptual leap from a king bee to a queen bee was the fact that he had lived through the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, a not insignificant demonstration of the potential effectiveness of female rule. Cer tainly his description of monarchy as an 'absolute form of government' inevi tably recalls the political culture of the age of the current monarch, James I.94 In other words, for all his novelty, with Butler we remain firmly within the circular processes which the anthropologist Marshall Sahlins described with the phrase 'the culturalisation of nature and the naturalisation of culture'.95 The Renaissance of bees is a mixed phenomenon, characterized by the elabo ration of ancient and medieval ideas about these creatures, a heightened tendency to moralize about human society in the light of them, and a new curiosity for understanding them better through direct observation. It goes without saying that in successive centuries a new world of concepts and ideas 88 Butler, Feminine Monarchy, sig. A3r. 89 Ibid., sig. A3v. 90 Ibid., sigs.

In this respect, modern investigators go even further than their Renaissance predecessors, since some now think that bees are conscious creatures capable of sophisticated decision-making processes.97 But the broader quest for both difference and identity between the animal and the human, witnessed repeatedly in this study, is a perennial phenomenon. It seems to be entirely in the spirit of the Renaissance that the distinguished American evolutionary biologist James L. Gould is able to state that the honey bee colony possesses an 'innate sense of free market econom ics' which 'allows it to turn in a higher and more consistent profit than any other group of social bees'.98 Only these days it is the market that is king.
