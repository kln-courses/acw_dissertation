PHILOSOPHICAL activity in Germany during the year i906 shows a number of different tendencies, although in a certain sense it is marked by unitary motives. These tenden- cies and motives can be understood only by reviewing antecedent historical conditions. The philosophical situation a short time ago might be characterized as bearing the hall-mark of Kant. Even to-day this condition continues, but with important quali- fications. The return to Kant, which was inaugurated a few decades ago by F. A. Lange, author of the Geschickte des Ma- terialismus, has worked itself out with great energy, one might almost say with vehemence. The achievements of eminent inves- tigators like Vaihinger, Riehl, Volkelt, Windelband, Cohen, Paulsen, to whom the collective term I Neo-Kantians' is applicable, have hastened the revival of Kant and have helped to deepen the influence of the Kritik der reinen Vernunft on modern intellectual Germany. Consistently with the many-sided and polyphonic character of the Kantian Criticism, its revival has proceeded from manifold points of departure. While certain investigators find in it an epistemological defence against metaphysics and, therefore, limit inquiry to experience, others erect on the foundation of transcendentalism a new metaphysics. Nevertheless both parties agree in their common claim to the title of Kantians. For the sake of making this remarkable state of things clear, men- tion may be made of two widely opposed extremes: the immanent school, thinkers like Schuppe, Rehmke, Schubert-Soldern, and Leclair, who proclaim allegiance to Kant, and the metaphysical school, including such men as Wundt, Eduard von Hartmann, 237</page><page sequence="2">238 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. and Volkelt. There are, however, common characteristics attrib- utable to all Kantians, and this is true less on the positive than on the negative side of their teaching, less in what they affirm than in what they deny, viz., a dogmatic, intolerant positivism, empiri- cism, relativism, and psychologist. Neo-Kantianism also takes a sceptical attitude towards evolutionism, in so far as it does not believe in the possibility of explaining all epistemological values by the stream of development. The limits of every empirical and evolutionary mode of thought are fixed by the a priori nature of pure concepts. In the last few years, partly within and partly outside of Neo-Kantianism, an important movement is noticeable, -a movement heralded by some as a renascence and derided by others as a reaction, -whose peculiarity consists in the fact that it aims to reproduce on a new basis the philosophical and culture significance of the idealistic movement from Kant to Hegel. The late Eduard von Hartmann somewhat ironically called this movement the "Review-course" (Retpetitionskursus). The prophecy, which he expressed to me personally a few years ago, that after Kant we should have Fichte, and after Fichte we should have Schelling and Hegel, has been fulfilled. Some time ago Neo-Fichteanism came upon the scene and attracted large num- bers of followers. It met abstract and theoretical needs, but more especially it met practical needs. Windelband in his Prae- ludien had pointed out that, apart from the metaphysical and dialectical elements, Fichte was Kant's most correct interpreter. For while Kant's transcendental epistemology, by its lack of rigid deduction, had no unitary foundation and consequently was without secure anchorage, Fichte was the first to postulate a single ultimate end, in terms of which all categories and episte- mological values are determinable. This end for Fichte is prac- tical, while the Neo-Fichteans, especially Rickert, regard the, end as theoretical, - a logical epistemological end, a logical ' ought' (Sollen). The movement, however, does not stop with Neo-Fichteanism; the latest, most epochal event in philosophy is rather the transition to Hegel, the constantly growing Neo- Hegelianism. This development did not take place along a single narrow path, in such wise that one might say that the</page><page sequence="3">No. 3.] PhILOSOPHY IN GERMANY. 239 whole of philosophical activity was at the start under the influ- ence of Kant and then, passed successively under the influence of Fichte and Hegel. On the contrary, all of these tendencies are coexistent; furthermore, mediating transitional forms of thought and nuances are not lacking. There also appears to be a movement directed not so much to the solution, as to the determination of the status, of the problems in terms of Post- Kantian idealism. A noteworthy fact here is that we find in the case of certain philosophers who avowedly made Kant their starting-point and who in some instances began as orthodox Kantians, clear approximations to Hegel, although these approx- imations may not have been consciously made. It is character- istic of the most recent German philosophy that the several stadia through which Post-Kantian speculation passed, are here reproduced on a new basis and in agreement with the spirit of the age. The modern movement began in Neo-Kantianism with the revival of the chief ideas of the Critical Philosophy. From Kant the path led to Fichte, from Fichte to Hegel. If one were desirous of giving more exact chronological determinations' to the movement, one would fix the year i906 as the year of the Renascence of Hegelianism. One must also note here that, while the influence of those Post-Kantian thinkers who were prominent a few decades ago, especially Herbart and Schopen- hauer, has begun to wane in the sphere of pure philosophy, attention has lately been turned to other men of the same period, to Fries, Beneke, and Feuerbach. This has been done with a view to placing their doctrines in the service of modern modes of thought. It is further- noteworthy that not merely in philosophy, but also in the widest circles of culture, the age of romanticism is growing in esteem and interest. The shibboleth of neo- romanticism belongs to to-day's program. The consequence is a-renewed and keen examination of the thinkers of the romantic period, Schlegel, Novalis, and Schelling, as well as Fichte and Hegel. And here one is not concerned with antiquarian, but with present, factual interests. By intimate contact with the ideas and-ideals of that period, it is intended to rejuvenate and purify our own culture.</page><page sequence="4">240 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. And so, at the present moment, we are living in the final stages of an apparently retrospective movement. But one would erro- neously estimate the movement, if one were to see in it merely a reaction, a return to an outlived point of view. The movement is, perhaps, not entirely free from this reproach, especially if one regards its extremes. On the other hand, it has enriched investi- gation with new motives, and, by its inner connexity with the past, has awakened the consciousness of the continuity of civilization. In proceeding to review in detail the philosophical work of i906, we shall have reference mainly to the above-mentioned relation- ships to Kantian and Post-Kantian philosophy as points of orien- tation, but without over-emphasizing this schema and without neglecting the fruitful ideas that are discoverable outside of it. A further principle of classification is found in the fact noted above, that modern speculation is divided between epistemological and metaphysical inquiries, wherein epistemology occupies, on the whole, the central position in the stricter, academic philos- ophy, while metaphysics forms the nerve of the popular treatises focusing mainly in neo-romanticism. Kant's influence, which at the present time dominates most of the German universities, continues to leave its imprint on philo- sophical production. Kantian investigation is guaranteed a firm basis by the Kantstudien, edited by Vaihinger and Bauch. The study of Kant shows partly an historical and partly a critical character. Minute investigation is unweariedly directed to the elucidation of obscure phases of the Transcendental Criticism, and epistemology strives indefatigably to advance by its own efforts along paths pointed out by Kant and to open up regions as yet undiscovered. The results have been greater since the Kant- studien has undertaken the publication of larger systematic mono- graphs in the form of supplements. In this form there appeared last year three important studies: Kant's Gottesbegriff in seiner positiven Entwickelung, by Julius Guttmann; Feuerbach's Straf- theorie und ihr Verhlitnis zur kantischen Philosophie, by Oscar During; and Kant und die Metaphysik, by Konstantin Oesterreich. Amongst the other noteworthy articles one might mention Bauch's review of Chamberlain's Kant in the June number and</page><page sequence="5">No. 3.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY 241 A. Messer's article, Die Philosophie im Beginn des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts. We shall return later to the first of these. The latter article is a review of a volume published in 1904 by Win- delband in commemoration of Kuno Fischer's eightieth birth- day, to which Bauch, Groot, Lask, Liebmann, Windelband, Wundt, Rickert, and Troeltzsch were contributors. One sees clearly here how the transcendental mode of thought, the sharp sundering of value and reality, has asserted itself through the whole range of philosophical disciplines. Messer regards as the future task of philosophy the formulation of a system of universal values, not theoretically but practically based. Bauch's article discusses Chamberlain's book, Imnmanuel Kant: Seine Pers3nlick- keit als Einfiikrung in sein Werk, which appeared in I905 from the press of Bruckmann. It contains a sharp polemic against the work. Chamberlain was already known as the author of Grundlagen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts. Whatever one may think of the details of Chamberlain's work on Kant, it cannot be denied that the two fundamental defects pointed out by Bauch do affect in an important way the entire volume. In the first place, any attempt to portray Kant's intellectual physiog- nomy without an exhaustive preliminary characterization of his work, especially in the case of a thinker like Kant where the personal recedes so far into the background, is not likely to succeed. Furthermore, Chamberlain does not carry out his plan consistently, but mixes up numerous theoretical elements of the Critical Philosophy in the character portrait. Besides, he has not grasped the notion of the transcendental with adequate precision nor sufficiently differentiated it from the psychological. Also outside of philosophy, especially in various branches of natural science, the work has given rise to heated discussion. Chamberlain's attempt to treat philosophy in intimate connec- tion with the methods of natural science, is successfully carried out in a work of Cassirer.' The first volume, which is the only one so far published, treats the history of speculation from the Renaissance to Bayle. It contains, in addition to a general episte- 1Das ErkenntnisProblem in der Wissenschaft und Philosophic der neueren Zeit. By ERNST CASSIRER. Berlin, Bruno Cassirer, i906.

XVI. mological introduction, three books: " The Revival of the Epistemological Problem,"' "The Discovery of the Concept of Nature," "The Establishment of Idealism." The author shows in the treatment of his theme the pronounced influence of the Marburg school, especially the influence of Cohen. This is seen chiefly in the fact that he discusses the history and systematic significance of the epistemological problem in immediate connec- tion with the positive sciences, more particularly with mathematics and physics. Consequently such thinkers as Kepler and Galileo receive very detailed treatment in Cassirer's work as compared with other histories of thought. Also the minute discussion of Nicolas of Cusa is another case in point. The second volume, which is already announced, will treat the development of philo- sophical thought in its divided course through Leibniz and New- ton. An exposition of the Critical Philosophy will form the capstone of this work, which is planned on broad lines. Kant's influence on the author is seen in his firm belief in the objective power of reason, not as a source of metaphysics but of experience. Cassirer regards the separate categories of investigation as vari- able; at the same time, he emphasizes the fact that they are refer- able to basic transcendental notions that are stable. An enterprise of the well-known Marburg philosophers, Her- mann Cohen and Paul Natorp, is executed in a similar spirit. The Philosophische Arbeiten are published by T6pelmann in Giessen, at irregular intervals, and consist mainly of dissertations and other essays expository of the transcendental method. In the announcement of the publication the following statement occurs: "Philosophy in all its problems is logically-bound up with the actual progress of science. Philosophy is, therefore, the theory of the principles of science and so of the whole of cul- ture. With Plato and Kant we call this vitalizing principle of culture idealism and apriorism." Amongst the essays published in the Philosophische Arbeiten up to the present time, Cassirer's study, Der kritische Idealismus und die Philosophie des 'gesunden Menschenverstandes,' is particularly worthy of notice. It is directed against the psychologism of the new Fries school, which will be referred to later. In future essays it would be desirable to have</page><page sequence="7">No. 3.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY 243 not merely the connection between natural science and philosophy investigated, but also the relation between transcendentalism and psychology. The meaning of inner experience needs to be more sharply determined. Kant set himself the task in his Kr. d. r. V of providing for experience a basis that would include general physics and psychology; he did not have merely physical experi- ence in mind, as one might suppose from the interpretations of Cohen and his pupils. Immediate reference to physics is found rather for the first time in his Metacphysische Anfangsgrfinde der Naturwissenschaften. This examination of the connection between transcendentalism and psychology cannot possibly lead to psy- chologism, for the transcendental categories are not deduced from psychological concepts, but on the contrary the notions of psychology are here regarded from a transcendental point of view. This aspect of the problem has been little noticed as yet. In many ways the lack has had more disastrous results for psy- chology than for Esthetics, for psychology has been left suspended between empiricism and metaphysics; mathematical physics, on the other hand, has received the greatest stimulus from transcen- dentalism. On the above mentioned relation between psycholog- ical and transcendental categories, I have attempted to cast some light in my Kant's Methodologie in ihren Grundsitzen. Kinkel's work on the history of philosophy 1 is filled with the spirit of transcendentalism. The first part, which appeared a short time ago, covers the period from Thales to the Sophists. The work has systematic rather than historical interests in view., Its purpose is to-serve as an introduction to the nature rather than, to the history of problems. This type of exposition is to be hailed with approval, for the history of philosophy, - except when written by great philosophers, and these for the most part tend to universalize their own biased personal point of view, - lapses too much into the philosophical and pragmatic, instead of follow- ing the important lines along which the evolution of problems takes place. The further continuation of the work will be 1 Geschickte der Philosothie as Einleitung in das System der Philosophie. Erster Theil: Von Thales bis auf die Sophisten. By W. KINKEL.

In the preface, Kinkel emphasizes his connec- tion with the Marburg school, especially with Cohen. Neo-Fichteanism, to which we now turn our attention, is not of the most recent date. As already indicated, the way for it was prepared by Windelband, and the movement was given more precise determination by Rickert. It was helped by existing in- tellectual and spiritual needs. Evolutionism, which in the course of the nineteenth century permeated almost all regions of thought and action, gained ascendency in Germany. Here, however, in the classic land of metaphysics and idealism, no system of philos- ophy based upon comparative physiology could maintain itself. That became plain in the doctrine of Nietzsche, which, in a peculiar way, was divided between evolutionism and meta- physics, and the influence of which has persisted to the most re- cent date. The double demand for a cosmic theory of productive energy, of measureless activity, and at the same time for a logical and ontological ultimate principle, was best met by Fichteanism. Fichteanism was more easily reconciled with transcendentalism than was Nietzsche's scepticism, which was formulated in avowed opposition to Kant. Under these circumstances Fichte's Wis- sensckaftslehre again came to the front. Even from the stricter Kantian school initiates poured into the camp of the philosophers of identity. Especially characteristic of this movement is a book by Medicus, a collection of thirteen lectures on Fichte, delivered in the University of H-alle.' Medicus attempts in this work to sketch both the personality and the doctrine of Fichte. We have here an interesting tendency to regard Fichte not merely as the most authoritative interpreter of Kant, but to place him above Kant. Schelling stood between Fichte and Hegel, and it might seem that, in the transition from Neo-Fichteanism to Neo-Hegelianism, Schelling's philosophy would have to be regarded as an- inter- mediate station. But the fact is somewhat different. One could draw this conclusion concerning modern thought only in case one were to regard it merely as a slavish reproduction of the philosophy of identity. That is so far from being the case that 1]. G. Fichte. By F. MEDICUS. Berlin, Reuther und Reichard, 1905.</page><page sequence="9">No. 3.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY. 245 an essential element in the philosophy of identity, the metaphys- ical element, is quite in the background in modern speculation. We have noticed, indeed, that the tendency of German thought toward metaphysics demanded the revival of Fichte. We are to take this, however, cum grano sais. The statement aimed to point out a general reaction against positivism, not any especial sym- pathy for the excessive growth of metaphysical speculation that had marked the post-Kantian thinkers. In Fichte we have an epistemological feature of central importance, the fact, namely, that he had succeeded, in appearance at least, in deducing all the forms of thought from a single teleological principle, a thing in which Kant had failed. In a word, Fichte was a logician, as was also Hegel in still higher degree. For this reason a generation of thinkers which had approached the logical conception of real- ity with psychologistic antipathies and logical sympathies, was disposed to cast in its lot with these two philosophers. On the other hand, Schelling's essential significance is to be sought out- side of logic, and consequently his influence is more strongly felt in other regions than that of exact philosophy. However, similar tendencies are not lacking in Schelling's work. When one regards as Schelling's greatest problem the determination of the relationship between nature and mind, between the uncon- scious and conscious, we can find its analogue in contemporary thought. I refer to the school of Eduard von Hartmann, author of the Philosophie des Unbewussten. With all its peculiarity and idiosyncrasy, this is the philosophy that is most nearly re- lated to Schelling's Philosophy of Nature and Transcendental Idealism. In view of the recent death of the founder of this system (June 6, i906), we must take this occasion to refer to him. Hartmann must be reckoned amongst the great men whose death occurred last year. Whether one may strictly reckon him amongst the immortals is doubtful. One must, however, admit that the evi- dences of his activity have not by any means vanished. On the contrary, in late years the sphere of his influence has been extra- ordinarily widened, and while the astonishing external success of the Philosophie des Unbewussten was accompanied by no deep</page><page sequence="10">246 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. intellectual consequences, but rather was calculated to diminish its author's prestige in specialist circles, even to such a degree that his immediately subsequent productions attracted relatively little notice, yet in his latest works he made an impression on the world of learning that was deep rather than broad. His Kate- gorienlekre, Geschichte der Metaphysik, Moderne Psychologie, and Weltanschauung der modernen Physik are works that cover not only a tremendous mass of material, but are rich in stimulus and points of view. The last named book, especially, attracted wide attention. The celebrated Russian physicist, Chwolson, in his work Hegel, Haeckel, Kossuth und das zwolfte Gebot' (all the more remarkable because of its original publication in German), cites von Hartmann as a conspicuous example of a scholar who has mastered a discipline remote from his own specialty and then has applied to that discipline the methodology of his own specialty. That is the judgment of an eminent physicist, who in the work just cited disproves Haeckel's physical theses by reductio ad absurdum. Von Hartmann's latest writings are concerned with biology, especially his work, Das Problem des Lebens,2 published last year a short time before his death. In this treatise he attempts to combine neo-vitalism, on the basis of which he com- batted Darwinism years ago, with the metaphysics of the Uncon- scious. The most prominent pupils of Hartmann are Drews and Leo- pold Ziegler. Both of these are advocates of the philosophy of the Unconscious, particularly the latter in his recently published Der abendlAindische Rationalismus und der Eros. They do not see in the philosophy of the Unconscious a mystic aberration from Kant, but the only possible interpretation of Transcendentalism. The foundation of this view is, of course, a psychologistic and not a logical foundation. They interpret the categories not as pure intellectual values, but as psychological processes, and from this standpoint they proceed, not inconsequently, to the assertion that processes of this sort must belong to the realm of the uncon- 1 Braunschweig, Vieweg und Sohn, i906. This may be regarded as a supplement to the polemic which Adickes began in his controversial monograph, Kant contra Zaeckel. 2 Haake, Bad Sachsa im Harz, where Hartmann's other chief works appeared.</page><page sequence="11">No. 3.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY. 247 scious, for in consciousness there is neither pure activity nor pure unity. They base their views, therefore, not so much on tran- scendental logic as on transcendental psychology. They also realize in a definite way the transition from Kant to Fichte and Shelling. The motives, however, by which they are determined belong to metaphysics and not to epistemology. The significant element here is the view that, within the psychology of conscious- ness, transcendental values cannot be psychically hypostasized, that wherever reference is had to such hypostasization, it must be completed in the realm of the Unconscious. Hartmann's phi- losophy of nature has also found adherents, especially amongst the neo-vitalists. To them belongs Reinke the well known bot- anist and biologist of Kiel. It is also worth noting that his in- fluence dominates a number of prominent periodicals as, e. g., Delbriick's Preussische Jahrbficher and the monthly review Deutschland. It may be surprising to some persons that I include Theodor Lipps amongst the partisans of the philosophy of identity. This partisanship must not, however, be regarded as a condition of philosophical subserviency. In an address which this distin- guished scholar delivered on September I7, i906, before the Association of German Naturalists and Physicians, he confessed essentially to the standpoint of the philosophy of identity. What we call law, he says, is not found in phenomena themselves, but is a norm created by the human mind. In phenomena are expressed only particular qualities and processes; a norm con- cerns the universal. Consequently, one cannot say that it is an abstraction from phenomena or is derived from pure description of phenomena. If, nevertheless, phenomena in their flux confirm the norm, if laws constructed by our understanding are at all applicable to external nature, this is possible only under the pre- supposition that a rational, creative mind ontologically underlies the conformation of nature. An universal cosmic consciousness must then include all reality, internal and external. The mechan- istic view of nature in its ultimate consequences forces one to this conclusion. The naturalist arrives at no true reality, for mass, which alone</page><page sequence="12">248 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVI. represents reality for him, is dissolved into mathematical relations, into relational concepts, which, although they contain a meaning, have no content. The concept of energy is a relational con- cept of this sort, a concept which represents no objective real- ity, but merely a methodological procedure of the naturalist. In general, one may say that most of the attempts of this sort in the interpretation of nature, are anthropomorphic. If one is to understand by the Unknown, for which the naturalist substitutes the symbol of matter, a sensible something, then we are forced to ascribe to it what we immediately experience, viz., a conscious- ness which, like human consciousness, is embraced in the divine All-consciousness.' This is, indeed, a conception which is opposed to the central thesis of Hartmannism. For in the latter the universal con- sciousness is antithetic to the Unconscious and signifies a negation of the individual form of consciousness. But the basic motive of the philosophy of identity, - the common root and inner unity of nature and spirit, - is applicable to both movements. We shall meet with other attempts to revive Schelling's ideas in the neo-romantic movement, which will be discussed later. We have already said that the chief philosophical event of the last year was the revival of the Hegelian philosophy. This was not a sudden thing, but was a long time in preparation. Hegelian influences had long been at work, at least silently. These are noticeable in Hartmann, Bahnsen, and even in Nietz- sche. They are visible, wherever Neo-Kantianism turned decisively from the empirical to the rational, as in the work of Cohen and Volkelt. Further, it was plain that a movement which had once got beyond Kant, would not stop with Fichte, but would find its goal in Hegel's intellectualism. For when we reduce the distinction between the two thinkers to the most general formula, purified from all historical particularity, we find realized in Hegel the extremest consequence of intellectualism, since here we have no ethical norm as the regulator of thought; but it bears its own end within itself and, accordingly, itself I This address of Lipps appeared as a brochure from the publishing house of Win- ter, Heidelberg.</page><page sequence="13">No. 3.1 PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY 249 creates the immanent means for its realization. There are two moments that are decisive for Hegelianism: on the one hand, the elimination from logic and the doctrine of the categories of every non-rational factor, whether this be, as with Kant, the manifold of perception, of sensibility, or whether it be, as with Fichte, the principle of practical reason; on the other hand, the dialectical method. Emphatically as Cohen rejects Hegel in the first volume of his System der Philosophie (Logik des reinen Erkennens), still he approximates the Hegelian position in deriv- ing the principle of multiplicity from the understanding and not from sensibility, and he converts space and time into categories, as the French philosopher Renouvier had done at an earlier date. F. J. Schmid's Grundzizge der konstitutiven Philosophie, by virtue of its consistent intellectualism, is also related to Hegelianism. The main reason, however, for regarding i906 as Hegel's year is the appearance in Holland of the Encykiopidie in German,1 a comprehensive volume with an exhaustive introduction by the editor. This is a noteworthy event, giving evidence, as it does, of the influence exercised by German ideals beyond German borders. While in Italy Benedetto Croce is busy with the propaganda of Hegelianism, Bolland is concerned with the same task in Holland. The manner in which the latter arrived at the Hegelian position is also interesting. He began as an enthusi- astic admirer of Hartmann, and only a short time ago, in his Col- legzium Logicum, made the decisive transition to Hegel. He is an Hegelian not merely as panlogist, but also in respect to the dia- lectical method. The strictly intellectualistic tendency of modern German thought culminated in Hegel. By looking back we can fix upon three tendencies that dominate our time, all of which find in Hegel their starting point. In the first place, the tran- scendental, logical tendency, which, excluding all empiricism and psychologism, aims to deduce the fundamental characteristics and categories of knowing from pure concepts. Secondly, the meta- physical tendency, which was active in Neo-Fichteanism as well as in the philosophy of the Unconscious, and which manifested 1 [The reference is evidently to Hegel's Encykiopadie derfphilosophischen Wissen. schaften. Herausgegeben von Bolland. Leiden, i906. - Translator.]</page><page sequence="14">250 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEfl. [VOL. XVI. itself as a reaction against the strictly immanent principle of posi- tivism. Thirdly, the monistic tendency, which clung to the unitary character of the metaphysical ultimate. These several tendencies found support in Kant's philosophy, but could not be brought to equilibrium in it. Because of his being divided be- tween psychology and logic, Kant could not be a pure transcen- dentalist. Further, because he established no distinct boundaries between immanent and transcendent reality, he never became a clear metaphysician. Further, he was and remained a dualist, in so far as he advocated the irreconcilability and incompatibility of sensibility and reason, of the empirical and intelligible worlds. Hegel, on the contrary, is a pure logician, for he ascribes to the self-unfolding concept dominion over all reality, over form and content. He is a metaphysician, for he hypostasizes the con- cept; he must hypostasize it, because a productive principle that creates reality represents not merely essence but an existence, a real being. He is a monist, in so far as he is a panlogist, in so far as he identifies the universe with logical function. The movement from Kant through Fichte to Hegel is un- doubtedly the dominant trend in the most recent German thought, but it is not the only movement. Alongside of this we have an attempt to revive the philosophy of Fries. We shall give a resume' here of its most important elements. In connec- tion with Neo-Kantianism and the revival of Fichte and Hegel, we have already mentioned the fact that the controversy between psychologism and logic stands to-day in the forefront of philo- sophical interest, and that to all appearances pure logic is destined to carry off the victory. In this important controversy the issue depends on two things, formal and transcendental logic. In the first place, the question is whether the laws which charac- terize our thought in general without regard to its content,- the principles of identity and contradiction- and the principle of the excluded middle,- are valid independently of the way in which they come to expression in man psychologically. Then comes the further question whether the categories of the transcendental logic, which are constitutive for our knowledge and for our con- ception of objective reality, are to be accredited with the inde-</page><page sequence="15">No. 3.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY. 251 pendence claimed for the formal laws of thought, or whether they are to be regarded and applied merely as rules for the inter- relating of psychological processes, as Hume understood them. The advocates of psychologism adopt Hume's standpoint; for every logical law, even the highest and most abstract, in order to come to consciousness in man, must be given to him as a psy- chological process. Also the norm which prescribes for us how we think, how we ought to think, contains reference only to how under given circumstances we actually think. The pure logicians do not deny this. Certainly their norms and ideals are in need of psychological realization, are therefore psychological phe- nomena; but their cogency and their universal validity are not dependent on their becoming phenomenalized in psychological processes. They would continue to exist to all eternity, even if no human individuals were conscious of them. In order that mankind should have knowledge of them, they must be given in psychology. However, they are not endowed with truth at that moment when they are found psychologically; on the con- trary, their truth is essentially in them. The logicians, therefore, do not demand the impossibility of transcending the limits of con- sciousness with the organ of consciousness. They merely intro- duce a new standpoint from which to survey the matter, viz., the normative, evaluating standpoint along with the psychological, descriptive standpoint. But there is a new task for the logicians. Just because they concede that logical norms and ideals, in order to be known, must somehow come into human consciousness, they find them- selves confronted with the necessity of describing more precisely this peculiar mental situation. For the mind performs here an act- of judgment which says that these logical norms and ideals are independent of their being thought, independent of their momentary manifestation in consciousness. This is no longer a psychological problem. For the characteristic mark of psy- chologism is that it recognizes no universal, independent values and norms, that it divests these of their absolute character and concedes to them merely relativity. They are for psychologist natural laws of thought and imagination, and consequently-are</page><page sequence="16">252 TEE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. not capable of being divorced from their relation to factual thought and imagination. If there were no thinking man, then the natural laws of his thought would be meaningless, just as the laws of mechanical motion would become meaningless, if not false, if the world's process were to stop. The logicians, on the other hand, maintain the universality and independence of their norms in contradistinction to natural laws. When they endeavor to seize upon the psychological expression of this distinction, they are not for this reason open to the charge of psychologism. In- vestigations of this sort have been declared by so radical an anti-psychologist as Husserl to be absolutely necessary, and the second volume of his Logische Untersuchungen is devoted to them. Here reason is confronted with a singular paradox, since it can give expression to its transpersonal character only in personal form. Logical laws are independent of the fact of their being apperceived by an individual. They are also independent of all modalities of such apperception, independent of the feeling of evidence, even if this feeling furnishes man with a witness for that independence. In contradistinction to psychologistic investigations, which direct their attack against pure logic, Hus- serl has called his studies (undertaken in the service of pure logic) "phenomenological," and therewith introduced into the contro- versy an important notion to which we can hold fast. It may be remarked here that these problems go back to Kant. We have already called attention to the fact that Kant sketched a comprehensive transcendental psychology alongside of his tran- scendental logic, and it was especially the former that led to the Philosophie des Unbewussten. This transcendental psychology is not to be interpreted necessarily in metaphysical terms; it may be regarded phenomenologically. What Kant wrote concerning sensibility, understanding, imagination, apperception, and reflec- tion must not be referred to unconscious mental powers which in some mysterious way beget the categories. On the contrary, they may be regarded quite as well as a phenomenological sur- vey of the various modes in which different cognitive values, mathematico-physical concepts, schemata, ideas, and symbols come to consciousness. Also the three grades of evidence which</page><page sequence="17">No. 3.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY 253 Kant grouped under the term ' modality,' - possibility, reality, necessity, - appear in this light as phenomenological rather than logical values. While the great successors of Kant, especially Fichte and Hegel, concentrated their attention on the objective content of logic, with the help of which they believed they could gain a deeper insight into cosmic processes, Fries turned his attention to the subjective, psychological interpretation of these logical laws. Consequently, he has generally been regarded as an ad- vocate of psychologism, who has stripped epistemology of the sovereignty given it by Kant and reduced it to terms of empiri- cal psychology. His influence, therefore, has materially dimin- ished recently, owing to the decided ascendency of logic. The new Fries School of G6ttingen marks an organized opposition to this well-nigh official neglect. It takes its stand on the assertion that Fries was not an advocate of psychologism, but a phenomen- ologist, that he made no attempt to reduce the Kantian categories to empirical rules of association or to ground their epistemologi- cal value in those rules, but that he merely aimed to show how the categories presented themselves to human consciousness. Elsenhans, Privat-Docent in Heidelberg, who stands outside the Fries School and is to some extent its opponent, has attempted to explain this point of view in a work of two volumes.' The first (historical) part, Jakob Friedrich Fries als Erkenntniskritiker und sein. VMrha"Itnis tu Kant, aims to set forth the essential features of the Fries doctrine, especially in so far as it purports to be a phenomenological continuation of the Kantian Criticism. Fries's theories of imagination and reflection, especially the latter, which is the most important factor in his system, are exhaustively discussed by Elsenhans. It appears from the discussion that Fries was really not an advocate of psychologism in the strict sense. He agrees with Kant-in regarding it as absurd to attempt to base the laws of the understanding upon rules of empirical psychology. He regards the significance of these laws as an a prior given, consequently as something that is not deducible 'Fries und Kant: Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte und zur systematischen Grundiegung der Erkenntnistkeorie. By TH. ELSENHANS, Giessen, 1906.</page><page sequence="18">254 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. from empirical procedure; he characterizes them as metaphysical. But the way in which man becomes conscious of them is not a priori; this takes place rather within the range of inner expe- rience, it is given in reflection, 'by means of which man discovers the metaphysical values and laws of mind. This subjective mode of discovery is what Fries calls transcendental, and he cites Kant in evidence, who understood by transcendental knowledge, not such knowledge as refers immediately to objects, but that sort of knowledge which explains for us the constitution of experience as a whole. This important view is Elsenhans's plumb-line in the interpretation of Fries. It is true he does not at all deny the fact that Fries was inconsistent in carrying out his phenomeno- logical position. In certain passages we have unmistakable psychologistic views. In the second volume Elsenhans intends to develop an essentially independent epistemology, having refer- ence, however, to Kant and Fries. A closer connection with Fries is maintained by the above mentioned G6ttingen School, whose leader is Leonard Nelson. Its organ is a series of monographs (published by Vanderhoeck and Ruprecht), the third and fourth of which appeared last year. They all contain noteworthy contributions to philosophy. Two were written by Nelson: Bemerkungen uiber die Nicht-Euklidische Geometrie und den Ursprung der mathematischen Gewissheit and lNer Briefe von Gaus und Wilhelm Weber an Fries. The school's program was announced by Nelson in the first monograph of the series: Die kritische Methode und das Verhiiltnis der Psychologie zur Philosophie. In this he repudiates the transcendental preju- dice, that consists in the attempt at a logical deduction of the categories of knowledge, and says that the fundamental problem of philosophy is the investigation of the form of the categories in psychological phenomena. To this dislodgment of logic by a one-sided phenomenology, Cassirer reasonably objects (in Der kritische Idealismus und die Philosophie des "gesunden Men- schenverstandes ") that it lowers the critical problem to the level of the naive understanding. This cross-section through contemporary German speculation exhibits an extraordinarily interesting organization in the grouping</page><page sequence="19">No. 3.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY 255 of its strata. Kantian criticism forms the central point about which the various philosophical movements develop in constantly widening concentric circles. First comes Neo-Kantianism, which has lost nothing of its inner force and external efficacy by being compared with the more extreme idealistic systems. Then comes Neo-Fichteanism, then the philosophy of the Unconscious in close relationship with Schelling's system, and Neo-Hegelianism. The first and third are concerned with the problem of an unitary logical method, the second with the problem of an unitary onto- logical method. All three are in principle concerned with the application of the categories, with the knowledge mediated by them; whereas the new Fries School fixes its attention on the subjectively given, its status in human consciousness, and thus the school takes a peculiar mediating position between phenom- enology and psychology. All of these movements get their bearings from Kant, to a greater extent even than did their pro- totypes, the Post-Kantian philosophers. The dominating signifi- cance of the Critical Philosophy at the present moment comes to expression here. At the same time, one sees that the current attempts to revive Criticism have in view its definitive value and are not concerned with empty reaction, but with its reintroduction on a higher plane. Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Herbart, and Fries aimed to go beyond Kant, to leave him behind. And so it happened that the most valuable critical ideas were early buried in the mass of new systems, and Neo- Kantianism was obliged to rediscover them before it was in a position to elaborate them further in any fruitful way. Modern investigation, however, has at no time fallen into this extreme. The fundamental results of Kant have in general been retained. The sharp distinction between the transcendental, metaphysical, and psychological standpoints, between the problems of logical values and real existence, the inquiry into the objectivity of knowledge, not in the service of polemic but of the rationale of experience, are elements that have been retained. Methodological and epistemological interests dominate contem- porary philosophy to such a degree that metaphysical questions, which a few years ago formed the focus of discussion, have been</page><page sequence="20">256 TSE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. almost silenced. The recent work of Ernst Mach, Erkenntnis und Irrtum, seems to characterize the state of the case. The author, who, in his Analyse der Empfindungen, ranged himself on the side of the anti-metaphysicists, is amongst the most popular thinkers of today. His polemic against Kant, against every form of apriorism and metaphysics, has created a profounder impres- sion on public opinion than the works of Schuppe and Avenarius, which serve the same aim, but are marked by greater knowledge and thoroughness, although more difficult and abstract. In his last book 1 Mach appears mainly in the role of methodologist, in- vestigating as he does the means and instruments of concrete in- quiry in the special disciplines. Another thinker, Richard Wahle, whose position resembles in many respects that of Mach, but who rejects only a subjective, idealistic metaphysics and not meta- physics as such, published last year a volume on the mechanism of mental life. The first part of the volume is devoted to episte- mology, the second part to psychology. An interesting feature of the work is its vigorous attack on Kant, which in principle is merely a reiteration of the author's position as defined in his earlier writings, Das Ganze der Philosophie, and Spinoza. It is fundamentally lacking, however, in real justification, for Wahle interprets Kant psychologically and sees in the Kantian categories merely subjective energies arising out of the depths of the human soul. In opposition to this alleged Kantian view, Wahle denies all psychological origin of the categories and sees in consciousness merely a secondary product of original factors unknown to us, which factors exist in and for themselves and independently of our consciousness. It is a peculiar' mixture of Positivism and Spi- nozism that Wahle advocates, and his unmistakable approxima- tion to materialism causes him to attack vehemently Neo-Spi- nozism as mediated by Schelling and modified by Hartmann and Lipps. In the foregoing we have outlined the main epistemological movements and in general the theoretical aspect of recent philo- sophical activity. But the picture would be incomplete without adding to it the ethical and aesthetic speculation, which develop 1 Der Mechanismus des geistigen Lebens. BraumUller, Wien und Leipzig, i906.</page><page sequence="21">No. 3.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY 257 on a broader basis and tend to adjust themselves to a unitary system of philosophy. Here immediate feeling counts for more than abstract reflection, here temperament rather than the under- standing lays claim to its rights. These culture movements demand attention all the more, because the revival of interest in philosophy in Germany is intimately connected with them. Evi- dence of this revival is given by the appearance of a weekly philosophical journal, edited by Remner and published by Rohde in Leipzig. It is almost self-evident that the beginning here would be made with Nietzsche, the traces of whose influence on our modern thought are deeper than those of any other thinker. Concrete, practical philosophical work in the last decades takes its bearings from Nietzsche almost as completely as theoretical speculation takes its bearings from Kant. To follow the for- tunes of his philosophy from its inception to the present would be useless and tedious in this place. Further, it would be futile to undertake to sift the immense Nietzsche literature that has appeared in the book-trade year after year and to examine its leading ideas. I shall, therefore, refer to him only in so far as there is apparent in his philosophy a fundamental tendency that finds reflection in a general movement. And first of all, one must note that Nietzsche's influence seems at the present date to have passed its zenith.' In proportion as Nietzsche gained recogni- tion amongst academic philosophers and became a philosophical classic, in proportion as he lost in the range of his influence, to this extent he gained in the depth of his influence. And this is not a regrettable fact. For it cannot be denied that the extra- ordinary eagerness with which the masses mastered Nietzsche's ideas, has been the fruitful source of false interpretations, to which danger his philosophy was from the start exposed because of its iridescent character. His criticism of ethics was regarded by atheists and anarchists as a declaration of war against every form of universal validity, as a nihilistic denial of the concept of duty. The further development of Nietzscheanism has, in this respect, undergone a fundamental change. It has shown that 1 Mention should be made here of the pocket edition of Nietzsche's works, of which five volumes have appeared, containing the writings from the Geburt der Trag&amp;Zie to the Morgenrate.</page><page sequence="22">258 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVI. Nietzsche was no opponent of morality, that on the contrary he was a pronounced moralist, that his scepticism was directed ex- clusively against the dominant traditional ethics and not against ethics in general. Vaihinger in his book, Nietzsche als Philosoph, has given honest expression to this view, and the same view appears in Simmel's Schowpenhauer und ANietzsche.' This volume of Simmel contains an extraordinarily interesting analysis of the tendencies of modern culture, especially its pessimistic and optimistic motives. He re- gards the view-points of Nietzsche and Schopenhauer as absolute positions, which are just as little demonstrable as they are refutable. Both originate in an elemental feeling of value, which the survey of the world brings to consciousness, and they denote the extreme poles between which individual and social feeling oscillates. Ulti- mately the question whether a man is pessimist or optimist is de- cided not by any theoretical consideration of pleasure and pain, but by the reaction of the individual to factual existence. There are men to whom not merely pain, but even the thought that any- thing exists, is fearful and unendurable; there are others who derive from the same thought a fullness of happiness that far out- weighs all possible pain. Neither the one nor the other of these men can be convinced of the correctness of his opponent's view, just because one is concerned here not with logical, objective arguments, but with the arbitrariness of basic personal tempera- ment. One may be converted to epistemological realism or idealism from without, but a man is born to his pessimism or optimism. It is our task and our right, as Simmel says, to assume the feeling-attitude of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, to keep our minds open to the influence of both poles, and to allow them to oscillate between the heights of triumph and the depths of despair. Especially important for estimating the contemporary attitude of mind is the way in which Nietzsche is adjudged. Simmel insists that the creator of Zarathustra should not be confused with the moral subjectivists, the anarchistic sceptics, nor with Max Stirner and the Sophists. On the other hand, Simmel emphasizes the relations of Nietzsche's philosophy, relations that were not clear I Leipzig, Duncker und Humblot, i906.</page><page sequence="23">No. 3.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY 259 to Nietzsche himself, especially the relation to the Kantian philos- ophy of his notion of eternal recurrence. This view of the connection between Nietzsche's views and antecedent theories bids fair to maintain itself. It constitutes a new step toward the organic unification of our intellectual civilization. The attempt to bring Kant and Nietzsche closer together, to reduce them to the expression of a single formula without destroying the individ- uality of their doctrines, is really sublime. In spite of the differ- ences between these two philosophers which Simmel concedes, still the tendency of his book is towards this goal of unification. For Nietzsche's guiding ideal, according to Simmel, is the ideal of superiority, therefore not so much the will for power as the will for value. In this respect Nietzsche approximates the Kantian ideal of free moral personality, and all the nearer when we take into account the fact that the differences are explicable in part by the confusions of Nietzsche, as, e. g., by his confusion of mental and social aristocracy. This may not, indeed, serve the purpose of the vulgar adherents of Nietzsche, who are simply intoxicated by the suggestive power of confusions of this sort. The real exponents of intellectual culture can only wish that a philosophical event like Nietzsche's system might not be swallowed up in mere sensations, but might leave behind it deeper and more permanent traces of its efficacy. And if we regard Nietzsche not as an irreconcilable opponent of the proclaimer of the categorical imperative, but rather as a natural supplement to Kant, then the continuity of German philosophy is exhibited on a splendid scale, and we may hope that on this broad foundation new struc- tures of permanent value will be erected. There is, however, a factor which causes Nietzsche's creation to sink somewhat into the background, a factor which at the start was favorable to its advance. That is the neo-romantic trend of the age. Doubtless there is no lack of connecting points between Nietzsche and romanticism, but they are not sufficiently evident to permit the two movements to run continuously parallel courses. Also, in many ways Nietzsche is anti-romantic. His religious scepticism, especially, brings him into conflict with the romantic group of ideas. The renascence of religious interests is</page><page sequence="24">260 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. almost the chief factor in the romantic movement. It expresses itself as a preference for the speculative, theoretical, gnostic ideas of the Post-Kantian philosophers, of the medieval German mys- tics.' To this religious factor one must add esthetic and literary factors. Realism and naturalism pushed to extremes have caused a reaction, which has shown itself in a vague, misty symbolism. The reactionaries have gone in search of inner rather than outer reality, and so a way has been prepared for the renewed study of the romanticists, who were the first to open up the night side of the soul for philosophy and to introduce it into art. The im- pression which a glorifier of the Unconscious, like Maurice Maeterlinck, made in Germany, prepared the way for the enthu- siastic admiration now enjoyed by Novalis. Indisputable is the charm of romanticism, in which art and philosophy interpenetrate one another and aim to form a harmonious whole; so, too, the neo-romanticists seek for a passage from aesthetic to philosophical feeling. Schelling, the classical philosopher of the romantic period, triumphs along with Novalis. While we found the influence of Schelling less marked on the exact, epistemological side of philosophy, and discovered its clearest traces really in Hartmann's system, he undoubtedly surpasses both Fichte and Hegel in his influence amongst the neo-romanticists. The sig- nificance of the unconscious for the structure of consciousness, its creative power, the deeper unity of nature and spirit, are factors that ally themselves more closely with popular feeling than does the dialectic of concepts. The neo-romantic movement has gone forth under Schelling's banner, a movement that recognizes no ecclesiastical dogmas, yet is disposed to promote the cause of the religious consciousness. It is not opposed to clear, logical knowledge, but believes it can secure a firmer, more immediate relation with the universe through mystic feeling. For a move- ment such as this, Schelling, the philosopher of art, the artist amongst philosophers, the dithyrambic poet of concepts, and the mystic of dialectic, was predestined to be the leader. The external focus of the neo-romantic activity in Germany is I In this connection one must mention Karl Eugen Schmitt's Die Gnosis, the second volume of which has just appeared.</page><page sequence="25">No. 3.] PHILOSOPHY IN GRRMANI. 26i the publishing house of Eugen Diederichs in Jena, which in this connection has just issued an instructive bulletin entitled Der Kultur der Seele. It covers the work of the firm from the year of its establishment in Florence (I896) to i906. The publica- tions are classified in terms of subject and view-point, and the classification shows a predominant necromantic character. This is seen in such sub-divisions as " Culture of the Soul," " Life with Nature," "Folk-life," "Philosophico-religious Culture," "Belles-lettres," " The Older Philosophy and Mysticism," " Ger- man Idealism." The large number of publications in these several fields, written in part by distinguished authors, bears wit- ness to the astonishing proportions which neo-romanticism has assumed in contemporary German thought. It would be dif- ficult to find a comprehensive formula to express its significance. One would have to define not only neo-romanticism but also romanticism, and this has never been successfully done. Cer- tain unquestionable characteristics can be pointed out, and these are in part noted in Diederichs's bulletin as the universal marks of neo-romanticism: a pronounced pantheistic tendency, the con- viction that matter and spirit are manifestations of a single force, belief in the organic unity of human personality and the universe, belief also in the marvelous power of the human soul to transcend the barriers of individuality and to penetrate into the infinite, and the disposition to regard limitless nature and reality itself as personal. The firm has performed a useful service in the publication of the works of early and recent mystics. Amongst these, the writings and sermons of Meister Eckhart occupy the chief place. It is also intended to publish Ruysbrock, Suso, Valentin Weigel, Thomas a Kempis, Baader, and G6rres. Fur- ther, a series of theoretical investigations of romanticism and neo- romanticism has been published by Diederichs, works for the most part of metaphysical and mystical tendency. Deserving of mention here is the Philosophie der Romantik by Erwin Kircher, published posthumously under the editorship of Heinrich Simon and Margarete Susman. The book attempts to expound the most important factors of the romantic philosophy, and treats with especial attention and regard the system of Schel-</page><page sequence="26">262 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. ling. Also Leopold Ziegler, whom we have already mentioned as an- adherent of Hartmann's philosophy of the unconscious, is closely allied with neo-romanticism. His neo-romantic leanings are clearly seen in his latest work, Der moderne Rationalismus und der Eros. By philosophical Eros he means a specifically romantic impulse, the impulse to metaphysical, intellectual theory, the history of which he sketches from Plato down through the whole of occidental speculation. He discusses exhaustively the philosophers of identity, especially Hegel. He distinguishes himself from the Neo-Fichteans and Neo-Hegelians by the same two tendencies by which he distinguishes them from Hartmann. He sees in the postulate of a metaphysical substance the founda- tion of his system. He abandons, however, the methods of dia- lectic and deduction, in the place of which he sets the method of transcendent induction. That is, philosophy should derive from experience conclusions as to its metaphysical presuppositions. With this is bound up the further consequence that philosophy has no- absolute, eternal truths to offer, but can furnish only an approximate solution of the riddle of reality. In spite of this deviation from the philosophers of identity, who fancied they had solved the world-problem without a surd, the philosophy of the Unconscious and especially the views of Leopold Ziegler are very closely related to neo-romantiscism. Belief in a mystic power of the human soul, whereby it is able, on the one hand, to assimilate and copy the whole content of the universe, and is able, on the other hand, to generate out of itself the world's con- tent, -this is the common belief and ideal that pervades the entire group of romantic theories. In conjunction with the above, we should mention the work of Heinrich Simon, which attempts to bring the views of Novalis into the light of modern epistemology.' The author, who shows the influence of Rickert, proceeds in the most systematic way and follows up every clue that leads from Kantian Criticism into the camp of speculation, metaphysics, and epistemology. Theodor Lessing, in his book, Schopenhauer, Wagner, Nietzscke, an introduction to contemporary philosophy, is to be classified '.Der magischc Idealismus. Winter, Heidelberg, i906.</page><page sequence="27">No. 3.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY. 263 amongst the neo-romanticists, although less because of the man- ner of treatment than because of the range of problems discussed. The reader who expects to find here exact philosophical elucida- tion will be disappointed. It contains brilliant psychological observations, subtle analyses, which to some extent are philo- sophically empty. The selection of representatives of modern thought is interesting, especially in reference to Richard Wagner. One must bear in mind that Wagner is the ideal center of neo- romanticism. And this is quite intelligible, for as thinker and artist Wagner stands on the boundary line between the two periods; he closes the period of classicism and romanticism, and he prepares the way by his technic and style for the modern period. It is difficult to pass judgment on the permanent value of neo- romanticism; for we are standing too deep in the current itself to be able to determine its direction and goal. It cannot be denied that it has produced much that is fantastical and absurd. On the other hand, the fact should be emphasized that it has immensely widened the range of problems, enriched philosophi- cal possibilities, and above all, as opposed to a leveling naturalism, it has laid stress on the differentiating power of the human soul on the ideal claims of virtue, and has preserved our continuity with the great past of classical philosophy. It is gratifying that along with the neo-romantic movement, Goethe's view of life begins to stir the minds of men in increased measure. Its wonderful harmony, the way in which it inter- weaves and reconciles abstraction and intuition, idea and exper- ience, reason and sensibility, mysticism and rationalism, secure for it a counterpoise against biased extremes, against unbridled fancy. The part played by Goethe both in the art and philos- ophy of the present is described in Simmel's recent work, Kant und Goehe.' One can see in the title reference to a synthesis important for culture, the conjunction of the two greatest intel- lectual heroes of our modern age. Simmel is first of all con- cerned with pointing out, amidst apparent agreement, the different I In a collection called Die Kultur, edited by Gurlitt and published by Bard and Marquard, Berlin, i906.</page><page sequence="28">264 THE PHILOSOPHICAL RE VIEt. [VOL. XVI. tial element in the temperaments and intellectual organization of the two men. And here Simmel maintains his reputation as a master of analysis. As he had done a few years ago in his book on Kant, so here he shows how Kant looked for the point of con- tact between subject and object as falling somewhere outside of perceptual reality, while Goethe discovers it in nature itself. Kant's essential gift was in analysis and definition, while Goethe's genius manifested itself in unification and synthesis. Kant saw the es- sence of the world in the moral law, that places an immeasurable gulf between the ideal and the real, while Goethe looked upon morality as well as knowledge, religion, and art merely as an emanation of cosmic force. Yet in spite of these differences, the common element remains: belief in the metaphysical value of the world and the demand that the value be realized in earthly existence. Under the banner of these two, Kant and Goethe, German culture will conquer. It is difficult to sift and eValuate contemporary philosophical movements. The difficulty is greater when one attempts to prophesy their future, and yet we can hardly think of the one without the other. In testing contemporary philosophy in terms of its truth or error, one surveys to a certain extent the conse- quences that will arise from truth or error for future activity. We have observed that philosophy now tends toward a return to Post-Kantian idealism. In such a return we are confronted with the disastrous possibility of reaction, of an uncritical historicism, dominated by a purely antiquarian bias, holding on to the past merely for the past's sake. But we shall hope that current German philosophy will not fall into this extreme, that it will take from Fichte and Hegel only the elements of permanent value. By this is meant chiefly the transcendental idea, which was wrought out by those thinkers with less confusion through psychologism than was true of Kant. We may claim as permanent results of contemporary philosophy the delimitation of transcendentalism from psychologist, the ideal from the real, norm from nature, value from reality. Fur- ther, we may note an advance in the fact that the psychological form in which logical laws appear has again been subjected to</page><page sequence="29">No. 3.] PHILOSOPHY ZN GERMANY 265 examination, that the phenomenology of logic is being studied, without forgetting that the latter is not for that reason dependent on the former. This advance, although not always clear, finds expression in the revival of Fries's philosophy. A great practi- cal rather than theoretical advance is marked by the attempt to transform philosophy into culture, to make for it a broad foun- dation amongst the people. And here there is need of the pilot's art to steer clear of the two dangerous possibilities of populariza- tion, - boundless mysticism and shallowness. The former shows itself especially in the growth of occultism, for which we have ample evidence in the publication of periodicals and books. The religious feeling that reveals itself in the neo-romantic movement will not, it is hoped, lend support either to caprice or to dogma- tism, but, remaining in its legitimate sphere, will translate into the language of feeling the ineffable in the human soul and the uni- verse. Besides, philosophy has the task of investigating the problems of religion logically and epistemologically, and there are many evidences that such efforts are under way. Here opens a new path to metaphysics, which, after long neglect, will doubt- less be eagerly discussed again. For this the influence of Kant and Goethe is guarantee, both of whom, in spite of their intellec- tual interest being focussed on reality and experience, everywhere point to transcendental values and ideals.
