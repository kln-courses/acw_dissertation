Rethinking religion and human-environment relations in Minoan Crete Vesa-Pekka Herva Abstract That the 'natural' world was imbued with symbolic and religious meaning in Minoan Crete has been suggested since the early days of Minoan archaeology. Notwithstanding, it often remains unclear how certain constituents of the physical environment acquired specific meanings, and what such meanings imply for the actual dynamics of human-environment relations. This paper considers the relationship between (what is today construed as) religion and human engagement with the environment in Minoan Crete. An 'ecological' perspective is adopted which assumes that both organisms and inanimate objects are a result of and subject to continuous development, and their identity is defined by the network of relationships they are endowed with. The idea is put forward that the relationship between people and certain landscape elements were of a social kind, based on mutuality and intimacy, and that some activities conventionally identified as religious or ritual are better understood in terms of practical engagement with the physical environment.

Introduction 'Natural places', Bradley writes, 'have an archaeology because they acquired significance in the minds of people in the past' (2000: 35). Notwithstanding, it often remains unclear how certain constituents of the environment acquired specific meanings 'in the mind' and what such meanings imply for the actual dynamics of human-environment relations in the past. In the Minoan culture of Bronze Age Crete (c. 3300-1100 BC), there seems to have been a close relationship between the 'natural' world and what is today construed as 'religion'. Scholarly attitudes towards this phenomenon vary, but it has traditionally been RRoutledge World Archaeology Vol. 38(4): 586-598 Debates in World Archaeology Tay.or&amp;Franciscroup Â© 2()06 Taylor &amp; Francis ISSN 0043-8243 print/ 1470- 1375 online DOI: 10.1080/00438240600963114</page><page sequence="2">Flower lovers, after all? 587 considered to indicate that a goddess of nature was central to the Minoan belief system and, by extension, the natural world invested with religious or symbolic meanings (e.g. Marinatos 1993). This paper addresses the relationship between 'religion' and the perception of, and engagement with, the environment in Minoan Crete. My aim is to present an idea on the nature of that relationship from an 'ecological perspective', which draws inspiration especially from ecological psychology (e.g. Gibson 1986) and developmental systems theory (e.g. Oyama 2000; Oyama et al. 2001a). This approach proposes that a mechanistic worldview and organism-environment dualism, although useful for certain purposes, limit our understanding of human-environment relations in Minoan Crete and beyond. The ecological perspective, as a kind of thought experiment, might provide heuristic value for reconsidering certain aspects life in Bronze Age Crete. Most importantly, I suggest that at least some activities conventionally identified as religious or ritual are better understood in terms of engagement with the environment, that is, essentially practical ways of knowing and living with the surrounding world, which humans co-inhabited with various kinds of non-human persons. Ironically, in this view, the term 'flower lovers', which is sometimes used in Minoan archaeology to ridicule the romantic vision of the Minoans created by Arthur Evans and others (Starr 1984; see also Bintliff 1984), captures something important about human-environment relations in Bronze Age Crete. Since expanding these ideas is the main objective of the present paper, only certain general features of the Minoan archaeological record are discussed below; a more detailed analysis of archaeological data will be subject to future study. Religion, ritual and relationality A conventional view in Minoan archaeology holds that religion is a system of beliefs related to the existence of divine beings and (religious) ritual, and a means of summoning and/or communicating with such entities (e.g. Warren 1988: 34-6; Dickinson 1994: 257- 60; cf. Peatfield 2001: 51-4). Rituals ensured successful life because 'the divinity was believed to have control over all aspects of the natural and created worlds' (Warren 1988: 34). Over the last decades, it has also become common to regard Minoan religion and ritual primarily as social and ideological phenomena, which created cohesion in society on the one hand and differentiated social groups on the other (e.g. Vansteenhuyse 2002: 242- 4; Adams 2004: 30). In this perspective, religion and ritual are metaphors of social life and reproduce social order. Recently, the performative, experiential and sensory aspects of rituals have also been emphasized (e.g. Hamilakis 1999; Peatfield 2001). This approach redefines the significance of ritual to some extent, or adds a new dimension to it, but the 'basic' function of rituals continues to be conceptualized in terms of the supernatural and/ or the manipulation of social identities and power relations (e.g. Hamilakis 1999; Morris 2004: 42). What these views have in common is that they regard rituals as 'acts which do not so much "do something" as "say something", or more properly, perhaps, "do something through saying something'" (to adapt a passage from Campbell (1995: 115) where he describes sociological views on consumption). This attitude to ritual is not peculiar to</page><page sequence="3">588 Vesa-Pekka Herva Minoan archaeology, of course, but represents a common pattern of thought in archaeology, anthropology and the Western world in general (see Briick 1999). The tendency to consider ritual in terms of the symbolic - a means of 'doing something through saying something' - seems reasonable because 'odd' activities towards stones (Fig. 1), for example, would appear to be an inefficient way of manipulating the physical environment; a stone is a stone whether or not it is touched in the manner depicted in Minoan art. While planting crops appears to make a functional sense whether or not 'beliefs' are involved, 'odd' activities towards stones seem comprehensible only in relation with the 'inner' mental world of the Minoans. It has been a dictum in Western thought for several centuries now that the 'real' physical world is composed of things that possess only quantitative properties, whereas qualitative aspects of the world are products of the mind (Manzotti 2006). Physical objects in this view have intrinsic and fixed properties and can effectively be manipulated only through mechanical causation (see further, Bruck 1999: 314^20; Griffin 2000: esp. 1 10-16, 208-10). The integrity of objects is thought not to depend on their relations with other objects; relationships and interaction between things are construed as something less primitive and less 'real' than supposedly 'autonomous' existence. In other words, Western thought gives ontological priority to things over relations between them and to form over process (Goodwin 1988; Ingold 2000; see also Manzotti 2006). Figure 1 Activities involving stones and trees as depicted on a gold ring from Kalyvia (drawn by V.-P. Herva after Platon and Pini 1984: no. 114).</page><page sequence="4">Flower lovers, after all? 589 The world in ecological terms, however, is primarily about relationships and process. The first premise is that organism and environment do not constitute two interacting systems, but one indivisible and dynamic organism-en vitonment system (Gibson 1986; Clark 1997; Ingold 2000; Oyama et al. 2001a). Turner's (2000, 2004) discussion of the 'extended organism' illustrates in a striking manner the interdependence between organism and its environment. He demonstrates, for instance, that the mounds of Macrotermes michaelseni are not merely manifestations of termite behaviour, but living external organs that constitute a part of termites' respiratory physiology. Similarly, it follows from ecological thinking that mind and agency are properties of entire human-environment systems and not reducible to the workings of the human brain; cognitive processes are external to humans as much as they are internal (Hutchins 1995; Clark 1997; Jarvilehto 1998; Knappett 2005; Malafouris 2005). It also follows that the properties of things are context-dependent and relational rather than intrinsic - they are not simply possessed by things themselves nor 'construed' in the mind (Gibson 1986: 127-43; Knappett 2005: 45-7; see also below). The idea of non-human entities as active agents is a familiar one in archaeology and material culture studies (e.g. Gell 1998; DeMarrais et al. 2005), but it can be carried further than is usually done if a developmental aspect is integrated into it. Namely, both organisms and things are a result of and subject to constant development, and the identity of all entities is relationally constituted, that is, determined by their physical, biological and social relationships with the other constituents of a given system (Jarvilehto 1994: 191-2; Ingold 2000; Oyama et al. 2001a; Knappett 2005). In Bateson's (2000 [1972]: 153; also cf. Gell 1998: 123) words, we must 'think first of the relationships and consider the relata as defined solely by their relationships'. 'Stranger aspects9 of Minoan religion Groenewegen-Frankfort (1951: 206) noticed over fifty years ago that, since Minoan religion 'is in many respects a unique phenomenon', there has been a tendency to 'look for more familiar Near Eastern parallels and to hail them without inquiring if they really elucidate the stranger aspects of Cretan material, or to explain away this strangeness in terms of modern common sense'. Later scholarship has also recognized that what is construed as Minoan religion had certain distinctive features (e.g. Dickinson 1994: 257), of which several are relevant here. These include the abundance of 'religious' material, lack of proper temples, popularity of 'nature sanctuaries', nature-centrism in art and the rarity of unambiguous depictions of divinities. To begin with, evidence of 'religious' and 'ritual' activities abounds in the archaeological record, but, unlike in other complex societies of the eastern Mediterranean, monumental temples were not built in Crete (Marinatos 1993: 39). Minoan 'cult places' appear in various forms and, despite certain similarities, comprise a rather heterogeneous group of extramural and intramural sites (Gesell 1985; Rutkowski 1986; Watrous 1996). Traces of supposedly religious and ritual activities are found not only in diverse contexts, but also frequently mixed up with 'secular' activities. Another conspicuous feature is an association between 'religious'/'ritual' activities and natural places. So-called nature sanctuaries, especially peak sanctuaries and sacred caves,</page><page sequence="5">590 Vesa-Pekka Herva were salient and even typical Minoan 'cult places' (Rutkowski 1986: 149; Dickinson 1994: 265). Similarities within and between the types of nature sanctuaries are in evidence, but there are also marked differences (Jones 1999; Nowicki 2001). Still, received wisdom holds that they all had the same basic function as places of worship - liminal places between the human and supernatural world - whether or not an ideological or political aspect was also involved (e.g. Rutkowski 1986: 64^5, 91, 113-14; Peatfield 1990; Tyree 2001: 40). Minoan art, in turn, shows 'rituals' performed in a natural setting (Figs. 1-2) and is distinctive for its general emphasis on the depiction of the natural world, which is underlined by the absence of clear ruler iconography and historical narratives. Nature sanctuaries and nature scenes have been considered to indicate that (a goddess of) nature played a major role in the Minoan belief system (e.g. Immerwahr 1990: 46; Marinatos 1993: 149-51). Unambiguous depictions of divinities are scarce in Minoan art. Gods and goddesses have been identified, but the postulated depictions of divinities do not seem to stand out from humans in any systematic and definable manner (Wedde 1995: 493-4). Such motifs as 'flying' anthropomorphic figures (Fig. 2) may seem to be obvious divinities (because humans cannot fly), but even these may well depict, for instance, hallucinations of flying humans (cf. Morris 2004) or signify the constellations of Orion and Corona Borealis (Kyriakidis 2005: 150-2). Minoan cult statues are also conspicuous by their absence, or at least rarity, although some of the larger and finer figures, such as the faience 'goddesses' from Knossos (Evans 1921: 500-1) and the chryselephantine 'young god' from Palaikastro (MacGillivray et al. 2000), are commonly interpreted as cult statues. The rarity of such Figure 2 The scene on the Isopata ring shows 'ritual' dancing in a natural setting with a small floating figure (drawn by V.-P. Herva after Platon and Pini 1984: no. 51).</page><page sequence="6">Flower lovers, after all? 591 objects has been understood to indicate that Minoan cult statues were either mainly aniconic, made of perishable material, and/or the epiphany of the divinity was central to Minoan religion (e.g. Marinatos and Hagg 1983; Warren 1990; Sakellarakis and Sakellarakis 1997: 530-9). None of the features discussed above is perhaps striking when considered in isolation and each can easily be explained away. Whether or not this is acceptable can be debated, but it is noteworthy that the proposed explanations for the distinctive features of Minoan 'religion' are sometimes very superficial. If, for example, 'nature-centrism' points to the postulated goddess of nature, the question still remains why she (or the 'natural' world) assumed such a central position in the Minoan mindscape. De-centring divinities That Minoan religion included animistic and shamanic aspects is commonly recognized (e.g. Kopaka 2001: 17; Tyree 2001: 43). But, whereas hypothetical divinities are frequently woven into interpretations of specific sites and artefacts (e.g. Watrous 1996: 81-96), references to animism and shamanism usually remain a generic way of saying that the Minoans had beliefs about 'spirits' and performed 'ecstatic' rituals (but see Morris 2004). This asymmetry is curious, given the problems of identifying Minoan divinities and linking them to specific 'cult places' (e.g. Peatfield 2001), but explained by the strong theistic underpinnings in the study of Minoan religion. 'If you assume that religion is primarily about gods, then you are forced to go looking for them' (Peatfield 2001: 54). The ecological perspective advocated in this paper provides a different view, as the following consideration of Minoan stone and tree 'rituals' indicates. Minoan seal-images depict human figures engaged in odd activities with 'sacred' stone boulders and trees (Fig. 1), and a few possible sacred stones (often referred to as baetyls) have been reported from Minoan sites (Warren 1990: 202-5). Stalagmites and stalactites also received special attention, and pieces of them have been found in Minoan houses and 'sanctuaries' (Rutkowski 1986: 50-2). That trees and baetyls were central to Aegean Bronze Age religion was first proposed by Evans (1901), who argued that trees and stones were, in some occasions, 'possessed by the divinity' and thus worshipped as aniconic representations of deities. While the exact nature of tree and stone 'rituals' is debated, Evans's general idea has been widely accepted. That is, stone and tree 'rituals' are commonly understood as summoning of or communication with divinities, and the stones and trees involved in them as either objects of worship in themselves, aniconic cult statues, or symbols of the places where divinities appeared (e.g. Nilsson 1950: 262-88; Marinatos 1989: 142; Warren 1990: 196-7, 202; Wedde 1995: 498). In this view, stones and trees simply referred to something beyond themselves or were temporarily possessed by a power external to them, but, in essence, they were just inanimate objects categorically distinct from sentient human subjects. The ecological perspective holds that the identity of any given entity in a human- environment system depends on its developmental history. Thus, non-human constituents of the environment can, as relationally constituted entities, develop qualities that are not reducible to their molecular constitution. Objects accumulate 'life-force' as a consequence</page><page sequence="7">592 Vesa-Pekka Herva of their long involvement in the social world, and artefacts, plants, animals and other things can acquire a special status as social beings (e.g. Gell 1998: 225-6). Due to prolonged social relations, even apparently inanimate things can ultimately grow into non- human persons or person-like beings (Ingold 2000: 90-8; Harvey 2005: 99-1 14). Such non- human persons can express their presence by diverse means, and their existence is therefore not a matter of metaphysical contemplation; rather, people encounter and engage with non-human persons in various ways and contexts in their everyday life (Bird-David 1999: 74-5; Harvey 2005: 122-7). In this light, Minoan stone and tree 'rituals' need not involve divine beings at all, but can be understood as interaction between people and specific landscape elements, which were sentient beings, and with which people engaged in a social manner. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that non-human persons were categorically distinct from humans or regarded as 'supernatural' beings deriving their life and agency from some non-human world. Non-human persons in this sense have very little to do with divinities as conventionally portrayed in Minoan archaeology (e.g. Rutkowski 1986: 108, 143; Marinatos 1993: 147-74; Crowley 1995: 475) as other-worldly beings, which were above humans in hierarchy and in control of the human and natural world. Rather, the world was inhabited by manifold beings with manifold qualities; some entities were simply closer to humans in form and behaviour than others. To conceptualize the interaction between human and non-human persons as 'worship' is to misrepresent the potential complexity of relationships between them. From religion to ecology The ecological perspective proposes that social relations between humans and non-human constituents of the environment are better understood in terms of ecology than of religion, that is, a mode of knowing and relating with the world. Touching a stone in the manner depicted in Minoan art, for instance, manipulates not merely meanings or 'mental images' of the stone, but the stone itself as a material thing. This is because all entities are relationally constituted, and their identity can therefore be altered by manipulating the relationships they are endowed with. To engage with a stone is to contribute to its development into a social being and not to engage denies the social status of the stone. If social relations with the stone are discontinued, it literally dies despite its continuing physical integrity (cf. Jarvilehto 1994: 191-2). The existence of the stone does not depend on whether or not people engage with it socially because a myriad of other and in some respects more powerful relationships also define the stone. This approach has also broader implications for our understanding of life in Minoan Crete. Most obviously, perhaps, the nature of so-called nature sanctuaries is called into question, as depositing practices at nature sanctuaries can be regarded as the maintenance of relationships with places that were living, person-like entities with their own powers and agency (see also Briick 1999: 328-36; Day and Wilson 2002; Herva 2005). In other words, and in contrast to the conventional views, nature sanctuaries - or other 'cult places' - need not have been connected with the worship of other-worldly beings in any meaningful sense or directly linked with the manipulation of (power) relations in (human) society.</page><page sequence="8">Flower lovers, after all? 593 This formulation, of course, is not a description of the function or meaning of nature sanctuaries, but merely seeks to open up new perspectives for considering the significance of places in Minoan Crete. The point is that all places had a potential to develop into non-human persons with which people maintained more or less social and intimate relationships. 'Places', as Harvey puts it, 'are not only environments and ecologies but persons, individuals, agents, active and relational beings, participants in the wider ecology of life' (2005: 109). The relatedness between people and specific places could, of course, be recognized, expressed and maintained in different ways and to various degrees. It seems plausible, for instance, that places such as Knossos developed a distinctive personality and a host of special properties due to its extraordinarily long and complex developmental history (see Day and Wilson 2002; Herva 2005: 223-5). In sum, supposedly religious and ritual activities can mediate human-environment relations just as directly and efficiently as, say, clearing forests for fields. Such activities are driven not by unsubstantiated beliefs or ideological and political agendas but practical environmental knowledge, which is of a different kind from scientific knowledge. Modernist epistemology assumes, to use Bird-David's example, that in order to know what a tree is like, it must be cut into parts, but knowledge about a tree can also be acquired through bodily engagement with it and perceptual attentiveness to the changes a given activity causes in oneself and the tree; this is what Bird-David calls 'talking with' trees (1999: 77). Minoan tree and stone 'rituals', for instance, are about knowing and relating with trees and stones as relationally constituted entities - parts of the lived-in world - rather than lumps of packed molecules. In the ecological perspective, then, the abundance of 'religious' and 'ritual' material from Bronze Age Crete and the stranger aspects of Minoan 'religion' indicate that the everyday world in Bronze Age Crete was richly structured, inhabited by manifold social beings, and full of marvels to be discovered (see also Herva in press). It appears, in other words, that the importance of divinities has been over-estimated at the expense of what might be called the 'animistic' aspect of life in Minoan Crete (also cf. Goodison and Morris 1998). Animism, however, should be understood as a shorthand term for sociality (i.e. two-way relatedness) between humans and the non-human environment, as described above; it is a way of perceiving and living with the environment rather than a system of beliefs or a misconceived worldview (Bird-David 1999; Harvey 2005). A virtue of this model is that it provides at least a partial explanation as to why the 'natural' world features in such a prominent manner in Minoan art and 'religion', as well as accounting for the rarity of clear depictions of divinities. Environment and culture in Minoan Crete Even the most superficial consideration of the factors involved in the development of the distinctive features of Minoan 'religion' is obviously beyond the present paper, but the potential significance of the dramatic Cretan landscape is worth noticing at a general level. Due to numerous factors from tectonics to the insularity of Crete, certain peculiar features and strong contrasts are typical of the Cretan landscape. For instance, there are hundreds of gorges with an individual character, thousands of caves and karst formations, and rich</page><page sequence="9">594 Vesa-Pekka Herva and distinctive flora (Rackham and Moody 1996: esp. 12-32, 53-73). More poetically, Crete 'is a land of hollow boulders and hollow cliffs, of mountains cracked across like pebbles, of bizarre plants known nowhere else, of tremendous birds, haunted by the ghosts of surrealist beasts; nothing is quite what it seems' (Rackham and Moody 1996: xi). Perhaps this strange landscape invited people to explore the richness, contrasts and peculiar features of the surrounding world, which in turn led to special relationships with various landscape elements. Altered states of consciousness may further have enriched the experience of the world and contributed to the discovery of the 'extraordinary' qualities of non-human entities (cf. Ingold 2000: 100-2; Morris 2004). This proposal does not imply that the environment determined 'cultural' features in some linear manner, but it recognizes that manifold environmental factors contributed to the development of local human-environment systems. There is no reason to assume that the physical environment, as a heterogeneous set of developmental resources, influenced 'directly' only some aspects of human life (e.g. foodways) but not others (e.g. art). Thus, categorical assumptions about what the environment can and cannot do are probably unwarranted (cf. Oyama et al. 2001b: 2-3). The question is through which specific mechanisms the environment influences human life in specific contexts. Nonetheless, it tends to be assumed that certain types of sites derived their significance from some general principles installed in the Minoan mind. Thus, for instance, summits of hills and mountains were appropriate locations for peak sanctuaries because of beliefs associated with high places (e.g. Watrous 1996: 77). Alternatively, or in addition, the location of peak sanctuaries was determined by socio-political factors such as inter- visibility between sites and distance from settlements (e.g. Watrous 1996: 80; Soetens et al. 2002). Notwithstanding, it still remains unclear why certain specific peaks were chosen. Even less clear is why nature sanctuaries other than 'typical' peak and cave sanctuaries were located where they were. For example, there seems to be nothing special, topographically, about the location of the 'sacred enclosure' at Kato Syme (Lembessi and Muhly 1990; Rackham and Moody 1996: 179). The Syme sanctuary is associated with a spring, however, and, in addition to springs, 'ritual deposits' are sometimes associated with pools of water, stalagmites/stalactites and fissures on rock (Rutkowski 1986: 50-2; Peatfield 1992). The point, first, is that it is by no means obvious which features of the environment attracted attention in Minoan Crete and were important to the development of special identity of certain landscape elements. Evans (2003: 45-72; cf. also Gibson 1986: 25-8, 51- 8), for example, speculates that textures of the landscape are central to the perception and signification of places, and Hagerhall et al. (2004) argue that the fractal dimension of landscape silhouette affects the appreciation of specific landscapes. A second point is that, in order to appreciate the significance of specific landscape elements, they must be regarded as individuals with their own identities, rather than representatives of types and categories. If a nature sanctuary site, for instance, was a non-human person, it was that not because of some pre-existing concept in the mind (cf. Bird-David 1999: 73), but because of its specific developmental history. There are certainly similarities within and between nature sanctuaries, but similarities in form at some phase of developmental history do not necessarily imply similar courses of development (cf. Oyama 2000). The challenge, ultimately, is to understand those processes of development.</page><page sequence="10">Flower lovers, after all? 595 Conclusions I have argued in this paper that some 'religious' and 'ritual' activities in Minoan Crete are better understood as practical and efficient ways of engaging with the non-human environment, which was inhabited by manifold beings with different developmental histories. This is not to deny that some activities identified as religious and ritual were primarily about the worship of divinities or reproduction of social identities. However, especially the theistic aspect of Minoan 'religion' would seem to have been over- emphasized at the expense of the animistic aspect, which here refers not to a belief system but a way of perceiving and living with the environment. This view proposes that mutuality and a degree of intimacy characterized the relationship between people and various constituents of the non-human environment in Bronze Age Crete. As a result of prolonged involvement in the social world, certain landscape elements developed into persons or person-like beings, and people maintained relationships with them that are broadly comparable to the relationships between human subjects. Potentially, then, the Minoans were flower lovers after all. The ecological perspective advocated in this paper does not, however, represent a retreat to the romantic vision of the Minoans, but seeks to correct modernist biases inherent in much of the present understanding of human-environment relations in prehistory. The ecological perspective, with its emphasis on relationality and development, promises to open up new insights into life in Minoan Crete, including such unobvious areas as 'religion'.
