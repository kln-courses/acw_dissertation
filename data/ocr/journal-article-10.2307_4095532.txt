<plain_text><page sequence="1">Studies in Late Medieval and Early Renaissance Texts in Honour of John Scattergood. Edited by ANNE MARIE D'ARCY and ALAN J. FLETCHER. Pp. 416. Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2005. Cloth, ?50.00. This volume, a Festschrift in honour of Professor John Scattergood of Trinity College Dublin, offers him 24 essays from friends, colleagues and former students. One hopes that Professor Scattergood will respond with good humour to Ralph Hanna's contribution, intended to encourage its recipient not to go gently into 'that great good night of Sky Sport' (p. 180). In order to encourage future productivity, Hanna presents codicological notes on five Trinity College Dublin manuscripts that will feature in Professor Scattergood's forthcoming catalogue of English manuscripts in that collection. The volume's editors concede that the subjects addressed herein are 'eclectic and wide-ranging', though each essay forms part of what they call 'the wider historicist project' (p. 13). Whilst the alphabetical arrangement of the essays obscures potential links and groupings within this diverse collection, some thematic classifications within this miscellany can be constructed.</page><page sequence="2">576 REVIEWS A trio of essays consider the reception of late medieval texts, authors and literary tropes within the print culture of the sixteenth century. Julia Boffey presents new evidence for the authorship and circumstance of printing of a Chaucerian-Boethian Dyalogue between Lady Fortune and a prisoner-plaintiff named in Thomas Godfray's edition as one William Calverley. This poem of the 1530s may take its form from Chaucer's short dialogue Fortune, yet, as Boffey demonstrates, much of its phrasing is modelled not on Chaucer but on Lydgate and possibly also Hoccleve. In a similar but more intricate vein, Greg Walker examines The Plowman's Tale, another text printed by Godfray in the 1530s. Walker undertakes a detailed process of 'textual archaeology' on the Tale's form and sense, revealing complex strata of interpolations and interpolations within interpolations. What appears on a superficial level to be a single unified text may in fact be the product of seven pairs of hands over the course of perhaps 130 years. Moving forward to the second half of the sixteenth century John J. Thompson investigates John Stow's editing practices in his 1561 edition of Chaucer. Thompson offers explanations both for absences, most notably Chaucer's Marian lyric, An ABC to the Virgin, and presences, especially Stow's desire both to preserve and to supplement the Chaucer canon. All three essays demon- strate that the reception of medieval texts in the sixteenth century must be a matter of careful study rather than easy prediction about the relationship between the medieval and the early modern. Two contributors provide, amongst other things, manuscript transcriptions of hitherto less widely known material. A. S. G. Edwards's contribution,'A New Text of The Canterbury Tales?' may not quite live up to its provocative title, but it does supply a published version of Elias Ashmole's seventeenth-century transcription of The Cook's Prologue and Tale. The variants of the Ashmole transcript show that it is not directly related to any surviving witness of the Canterbury Tales, and thus a new text can be imagined, even if only a fragment survives. Richard Firth Green's title is more modest,' The Hunting of the Hare: An Edition', but he offers both a new edition of this knockabout mock-heroic stampede and a concise reassessment of its cultural neighbours and analogues. A brace of essays investigate the date of the Auchinleck Manuscript and its relationship to its historical moment. Examination of an interpolation within the Anonymous Short Metrical Chronicle that mentions the caves and tunnel below Nottingham Castle allows Helen Cooper not only to provide a later terminus post quem for the manuscript as a whole, but also to throw light on the earliest English reaction to French accounts of the adultery of Lancelot and Guinevere. Oliver Pickering also finds in Auchinleck elements which are ahead of its times, especially the Alphabetical Praise of Women whose rhetorical verve far exceeds its Anglo-Norman source. As with Walker's exploration of The Plowman's Tale, much of Pickering's analysis of the manuscript as a whole relies on detailed consideration of stanza-form and rhyme scheme, facilitated in his case by access to the forthcoming Electronic Index of Middle English Verse. As befits a volume presented to the author of Politics and Poetry in the Fifteenth Century, three contributions examine texts that are in some sense political. Helen Phillips surveys a pair of lyrics and a pair of chronicle accounts, all of which preserve memories of Edward I. She demonstrates how all four retrospectively reshape the history of his reign according to different models of kingship, particularly those of crusader and feudal lord. The financial relationship between a feudal lord and his tenants in the form of purveyance and prise provides the historical context for Wendy Scase's study of one of the political poems from London, British Library, MS Harley 2253. Satire on the Retinues of the Great, as Scase makes plain, is not simply a virulent and all-embracing tirade against grooms and horsemen, but a text that shares strategies of complaint and reform with much more sober legal, legislative and advisory discussions of purveyance. Helen Conrad-O'Briain's</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 577 political reading of Sir Orfeo is of a much more muted but equally persuasive kind. She interprets Orfeo not as an allegory of contemporary events, but as political in its own right through its comparison of two kings, two realms, two societies and two representations of power. Turning from the public world of Crown and State to the spheres of privacy, courtesy and emotion, a pair of complementary essays contemplate the grief of separation and our response to such grief. J. A. Burrow describes how courteous men and women behave when they unexpectedly encounter a stranger in a state of distress. Their 'civil inattention' (p. 67), as it is called by sociologists, supplies an explanation for the Dreamer's potentially puzzling imperceptiveness in Chaucer's Book of the Duchess. Charlotte C. Morse recounts not scenes of grief approached but grief at departure, both in chronicle accounts of embarkation on crusade and in romance depictions of leave-taking for adventure, particularly that of the grail quest. Both essays remind us of the need to take due note of social manners and modes when reading medieval literature. A contribution to a Festschrift such as this offers the opportunity, freed somewhat from the pressures of space in a journal or the potentially sceptical tone of a reader's report, for scholars to return to previously published ideas, to develop or reconsider earlier material and to blend together old perspectives and new. Derek Pearsall casts his emeritus eye over the opinions of his younger self in an article that lays bare the inner contra- dictions and obfuscations of allegorised and moralised courtly love as presented in two fifteenth-century poems, the Flower and the Leaf and the Assembly of Ladies. Returning to Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Myra Stokes shows how the cognomen 'Gawain the Good' moves, as many things do in this poem, from a position of seeming certainty and unproblematic usage to instances that are compromised and definition-defying. Angela M. Lucas revisits Chaucer's Franklin's Tale, on which she has published previously, but finds a new path to trace. In this case her focus is on this narrative's third wheel, the squire Aurelius, whose education at the end of the Tale, as Lucas shows, offers a model for the Franklin's own son who has not yet learned gentilesse. Peter J. Lucas continues his work on John Capgrave, this time an introduction to Capgrave's Solace ofPilgrimes, his guide to Rome's churches, topography and architecture. Investigating the historicity of the alliterative poem, St Erkenwald, Thorlac Turville-Petre reminds us of the poem's foundations in historical sources, before turning to the possibility that the ancient tomb discovered in the poem may be a historical artefact rather than a creation of poetic imagination. James Simpson describes his own return to ethics as a topic of study via John Gower's Confessio Amantis. He advances a new model, in which ethics are not transmitted with certainty through literary forms but are destabilised by their incorpora- tion into fictional narrative. Simpson's text of choice, William Caxton's History of Reynard the Fox, however goes far beyond this. In Simpson's reading, it does not destabilise ethics but reverses them so that ethical values and techniques accomplish unethical results. Simpson's valuable article offers interesting stimuli for any student of ethical narratives, especially ones of an anthropomorphic or zoomorphic character. Valerie Allen's contribution, 'Playing Soldiers: Tournament and Toxophily in Late- Medieval England', reintroduces us to toxophily, a word glossed by the New Zealand Listener (as quoted in the online OED) as 'a very exclusive and fancy word for the shooting of bows and arrows'. This gloss describes the less appealing qualities of Allen's essay, a very exclusive and fancy juxtaposition of literary anecdote, brief summaries of hermeneutic and phenomenological reading strategies and a pick-and-mix approach to history in which chroniclers, especially Froissart, are cited without sufficient context as unproblematic witnesses to contemporary estimations of Richard II and his tournaments. Another contribution by a former student, Anne Marie D'Arcy, is more</page><page sequence="4">578 REVIEWS convincing, assembling compendious evidence from exegetical tradition and legal practice to discern the precise nature of Cresseid's crime and punishment in Robert Henryson's Testament of Cresseid. Three contributions in particular suggest that this volume will be keenly fought over in libraries by both researchers and undergraduates. In 'Pearl and the Limits of History', Alan J. Fletcher elegantly confutes those readings of Pearl in which the poem's own voice is 'drowned out' (p. 149) by other discourses on which that voice draws, especially those interpretations that allocate a particular identity to the Pearl-Maiden. When reading a text such as Pearl in which so many theological, literary, social and historical inspirations and registers can be identified, Fletcher confronts the fact that we must construct 'scales of likelihood in reader response' (p. 168) and be prepared to set aside some possible but less likely historical contexts. Rather than a single determined circumstance, Fletcher argues that Pearl is an elusive 'variegated hybrid' (p. 160) both of secular and sacred material and of various clerical discourses, not only liturgical but also those of preaching and pastoral theology. Whatever its genesis, Fletcher argues persuasively that Pearl makes strange those discourses it engages, necessarily frustrating any attempt to specify too precisely their historical referents. Also sought out will be David Aers's piece on the Wycliffite William Thorpe's Testimony. Aers measures Thorpe's understanding of grace, predestina- tion, penance and other matters against the precision of Augustinian theology. This is an illuminating manoeuvre that exposes how much of the theological guidance provided by the Scriptures, particularly the Pauline epistles, is disregarded or obscured in some Lollard thought. But can such a match-up between the Doctor of Grace and a Wycliffite preacher writing polemic attack and defence of a type as idiosyncratic as Thorpe's be in any sense a fair fight? It is significant that Aers does not confront the Doctor Evangelicus himself in this Augustinian inquiry and that reference to Wyclif's writing is minimal and via footnotes directing the reader to Aers's own work. Most sought-after, perhaps, will be Alastair J. Minnis's thoughtful analysis of William Langland's theology of indulgences in Passus Seven of the B-text of Piers Plowman. Minnis identifies the changing nature of pardons in this passus, most notably the pardon that Piers so famously tears, by careful comparison with contemporary ecclesiastical practice and understanding. In keeping with Fletcher's plea for 'scales of likelihood' when assigning historical resonance to Pearl, Minnis's judicious contextualisation reveals that the pardons described in Passus Seven are much less provocative and atypical than might be thought, a process which then allows reassessment of Langland's allegorical intentions. As this brimful and abundant collection shows as a whole, this very readable essay demonstrates the immense benefit of using the written evidence of history both to extend and to limit our interpretation of literature.
