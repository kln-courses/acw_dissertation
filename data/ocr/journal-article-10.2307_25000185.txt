<plain_text><page sequence="1">HAIG KHATCHADOURIAN VAGUENESS, VERIFIABILITY AND METAPHYSICS I In another place 1 I have attempted to show, among other things, that there is a class of utterances which are non-confirmable and non-disconfirmable, yet are not devoid of meaning in the sense of signification (hereafter referred to as meaningl2), as a whole. They are not nonsensical or cognitively meaningless as the logical positivist's verifiability principle would have us suppose. The utterances I have in mind are simply those which we ordinarily call vague statements; utterances which express vague propositions.3 These utterances are neither analytic nor synthetic, properly speaking; though they purport to be the one or the other. Further, vagueness is scalar in character; but meaning1 itself does not admit of degrees. Some vague state ments (also concepts and propositions) are only slightly, or very slightly vague; others are fairly or moderately vague; while still others are extremely or "hopelessly" vague. A good part of the significance of these and other results reached in the paper alluded to stems from their application to particular classes of philo sophical utterances. Metaphysical utterances are perhaps the most important class of philosophical utterances to which these results apply. In the present paper I shall discuss and analyse some vague metaphysical utterances; and shall examine in some detail the reasons for the vagueness of many vague metaphysical utterances. I shall also point out some of the fundamental implications of our results for metaphysics as traditionally understood and practised. These things should give us a better understanding of many 1In 'Vagueness, Meaning, and Absurdity', American Philosophical Quarterly 2 (1965) 119-29. 2 The Oxford English Dictionary defines this sense of 'meaning' as follows: "that which is intended to be or actually is expressed or indicated. a. Of language, word, etc.: The signification, sense, import; sense, interpretation. 3 For an analysis of the ordinary notion of vagueness in relation to single words, phrases, sentences, statements, concepts and propositions, see my 'Vagueness', Philosophical Quarterly 12 (1962) 138-52. I should add that in my 'Vagueness, Meaning, and Absurdity' I distinguished a second use or sense of 'vague statement' (and 'vague proposition'), over and above the one analysed in 'Vagueness'. But none of my remarks in this paper are intended to refer to vague statements or propositions in this second sense; though at least part of what I say is, to my mind, also true of them. Consequently, I shall not say anything further about this matter. Foundations of Language 1 (1965) 249-267.

If it is true that some, perhaps many, traditional metaphysical utterances - including whole "doctrines", "views" or "theories" - are vague, the logical positivist's dismissal of all metaphysical utterances as nonsensical or meaningless will be clearly untenable. The non-testability in principle of these utterances, if our view is correct, would be a logical consequence (hence symptomatic) not of their alleged meaninglessness but of their vagueness. Similarly, if our view is correct, it follows that one cannot validly hold, as J. W. N. Watkins has recently maintained4, that metaphysical utterances, though non-defeasible, are confirmable (in some rather unusual sense of this word, however). If some metaphysical utterances are vague, then it is false that all metaphysical utterances are confirmable though non-defeasible. In the third place, our view entails the erroneousness of the thesis that all metaphysical utterances are covert linguistic recommendations; that traditional metaphysics as a whole is "revisionary" metaphysics. (The thinkers who hold this view may perhaps make an exception in the case of Kant; with regard to his attempt, in the Critique of Pure Reason, to discover what he believed to be the a priori categorial scheme of human thought. That may be regarded as really an instance of "descriptive" metaphysics; or at least something akin to it.) For in terms of the notions of intra categorial and inter-categorial violations of (ordinary) meaning5, the fore going view is tantamount to the thesis that all traditional metaphysical utterances commit some intra-categorial or inter-categorial error of meaning, or both, viewed from the standpoint of the ordinary meanings of the ex pressions in question. Whereas these notions are inapplicable to extremely vague statements, including extremely vague metaphysical ones (if any).6 Thus the issue between that position and ours rests on the question whether or not there are any extremely vague metaphysical utterances. However, as we shall see presently, it is my thesis that many traditional metaphysical 4 'Between Analytic and Empirical', Philosophy 32 (1957); and 'Confirmable and Influential Metaphysics', Mind 47 (1958) 344-65. 5 An inter-categorial mistake or violation of the meaning of an expression occurs if its use in a particular context involves a "leap" or "jump" from one category - the category to which the expression conventionally belongs - to some other category. For example, an inter-type mistake occurs, relative to ordinary language, if 'time' is used as though it meant the same as 'duration (enduring) in time', if time is identified with duration (en during) in time. On the other hand, an intra-type mistake occurs if an expression is used in a distinctly different meaning from the meaning it conventionally has, but without thereby effecting a category leap or jump. For example, an intra-type mistake occurs, relative to ordinary language, if 'cow' is literally used to mean "an admiral". 6 Cf. my 'Vagueness, Meaning, and Absurdity'. 250</page><page sequence="3">VAGUENESS, VERIFIABILITY AND METAPHYSICS statements - at least many of those to which I shall refer as ontologistic metaphysical statements - are vague precisely because their authors deliber ately attempt, or are consciously or unconsciously forced to attempt, to modify ordinary concepts. Complete meaninglessness is the outcome when ever this attempt fails to result in any proper concepts at all, which can take the place of the abandoned ordinary concepts. On the other hand, if the attempt to modify a given ordinary concept fails to result in any clear and precise concept, the outcome is vagueness. Finally, if our thesis is correct, we cannot hold that all traditional metaphysical utterances are directives or rules of some sort, hence that they do not express any propositions. For if some actual metaphysical utterances are vague, they cannot properly function as any kind of rule; though they may be covertly or overtly in tended to function as rules by the philosopher who frames them. And if they are extremely vague, there would be no logical basis for claiming either that they are, or that they are not, rules or directives of any kind. Now I do hold, as I stated a little earlier, that in many cases the vagueness of vague traditional metaphysical statements is due to their authors' de parture from ordinary usage and their failure to give us another clear usage (and use) in lieu of the one departed from. The non-confirmability and non defeasibility of these statements are logical consequences of this state of affairs. We must here emphasize that the departure from ordinary usage is not, by itself, responsible for the non-confirmability and non-defeasibility of these statements. We should also add that the metaphysician's modification or complete abandonment of ordinary meanings or concepts is not at all a sufficient condition of the particular utterance's being metaphysical in nature. This is true irrespective of whether the resulting utterance has a clear meaning,, is vague or is completely meaningless1. To dramatize this essential point, and therefore to show that the revisionary character of metaphysics - if and when it is revisionary - cannot provide us with the (or even a) distinguishing mark of metaphysics as a whole, it is enough to recall that a large number of scientific statements involve a "shift of meaning". This does not in any way detract from their scientific character, or make them empirically untestable. In the case of philosophy, it is enough to recall that traditional epistemologists, moral philosophers and aestheti cians frequently modified ordinary usage or altogether abandoned it. And they did this when they were attempting to analyse the fundamental concepts of knowledge, ethics or aesthetics, as well as when they purported to give us empirical propositions about the psychological processes involved in the individual's acquisition of knowledge, about the springs of human action, or about the processes or activities involved in the creation, or the enjoyment, of art. It is for this reason, I think, that Gilbert Ryle states that "... What 251</page><page sequence="4">HAIG KHATCHADOURIAN is commonly expected of a metaphysician is that he should assert the existence or occurrence of things unseen and give for these assertions purely philo sophical or conceptual reasons. If he is not an ontologist he is not a meta physician."7 Where Ryle errs, it seems to me, is in his limitation of (tra ditional) metaphysical assertions to those about "things unseen", if not also in his limitation of the reasons for these assertions to "purely philo sophical or conceptual" ones. A good deal of traditional metaphysics is about "things seen" - about objects or phenomena that actually form part of nature, or about nature as a whole - or what the metaphysician claims are actually observable but hitherto unobserved things that he has discovered. For instance, a good deal of traditional metaphysics is about the "ontologi cal status" of sensible objects (epistemological monism or realism; phe nomenalism; etc.); about the origin of the physical universe and of man (the notion of creation ex nihilo; or the notion of the eternity of the universe). A good example of traditional assertions that purport to be about alleged natural objects or phenomena discovered by the metaphysician is the classical sense-datum theory in Berkeley and Hume, and its modern forms in G. E. Moore, C. D. Broad, and modern phenomenalism (in the last instance, in those cases where the metaphysician does not limit his claims to a recommendation to replace the ordinary language of perception with a phenomenalist language). But more of this later. The metaphysician's departure from ordinary language may occur in two theoretically possible types of cases. In the first place, (a) the ordinary expressions whose uses are modified or abandoned may themselves be vague expressions. This type of situation is comparatively rare; since vague ordinary expressions are hard to come by, outside the field of practical politics and, perhaps, morality and religion. (In general, where the expressions are value terms, or involve some valuational element in their meaning.) Much more frequently, (b) the ordinary expressions involved are perfectly non-vague; but ironically enough the metaphysician modifies or altogether rejects their meaning, on the mistaken assumption that they (these expressions) are vague. So he attempts to give the word or words in question a partly or wholly new precise meaning - but more often than not fails dismally. This is clearly tied up with the general error widely observable in philosophy of the past - from which only some contemporary philosophers have freed themselves - that ordinary language as a whole is vague, in the ordinary meaning of 'vague'. In contemporary philosophy this error is frequently associated with the confusion of vagueness with marginal indeterminacy; though some of the philosophers who are guilty of this confusion are not revisionary 7 Nature of Metaphysics (ed. by D. F. Pears), London 1957, p. 144. Italics mine. 252</page><page sequence="5">VAGUENESS, VERIFIABILITY AND METAPHYSICS metaphysicians themselves. A second possible source of error is the frequent lack of clarity about the difference between vagueness and ambiguity; and a third possible source of error is the confusion or identification of vagueness with what W. B. Gallie calls the "essential contestedness" of value concepts8; assuming that the latter is not the same as or a part, or a logical consequence, of the openness of a value concept (if and when it is open-textured). I should interject here that it would be illegitimate to label all departures from ordinary language by metaphysicians or other philosophers a misuse or abuse of language; and so to condemn out of hand all revisionary metaphysical "views", "doctrines", or individual utterances as improper or illegitimate. The deliberate departure from ordinary usage, if there are good reasons for doing so - and there certainly may be good reasons, logical or empirical, including pragmatic, reasons in the case of some ordinary ex pressions - is not a defect or error. Even if the departure is unnecessary; e.g. where the ordinary meaning or concept departed from is perfectly self-consistent and clear, the new meaning may be, as such, perfectly proper. We cannot properly condemn it as a proposed meaning of the particular expression, merely because it is different from its ordinary meaning, and because it is superfluous for ordinary purposes, and/or philosophy as a whole. It becomes something to be logically condemned if the expression in question is (i) given a vague meaning1; or if it is (ii) given no meaning1 at all. Frequently, the former occurs; and, in a way, it is a graver matter than the latter. For vagueness, particularly moderate vagueness, is more likely to pass unnoticed than complete meaninglessness,. The lack of com plete precision is usually more difficult to detect. There are various reasons for this. Let me merely mention one or two of them which relate to the fact that vague statements do have some meaning,. The presence of some meaning1 - and what we are saying is mainly if not wholly confined to moderately vague expressions, since extremely vague expressions border on meaninglessness1 and are therefore, I think, easier to detect - creates the illusion that the statement is perfectly meaningful, hence true or false and confirmable and/or defeasible. So the reader is spurred on to a wild goose chase of what this or that philosopher "meant" or "must have meant" or "could have meant" by this or that word or phrase, by this or that seemingly profound statement; and to ask whether what he actually meant, what he must or could have meant, is true. Elaborate arguments are constructed to defend or attack the philosopher's assertions, to prove their truth or to disprove them. This, in brief, is the familiar picture of a good deal of the 8 'Essentially Contested Concepts', Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, N.S. 41 (1956) 167-98. See also my 'Vagueness', passim. 253</page><page sequence="6">HAIG KHATCHADOURIAN attempts of the traditional, and some contemporary, philosophers or his torians of philosophy to understand and to come to terms with the "views", "doctrines" or "theories" of other philosophers. Such attempts are not, however, without value. For one thing, they may and, sometimes, do result in the realization that the whole quest for clear meaning is here doomed to failure. Hopefully, they may also result in the discovery of the underlying reasons for this failure. Another reason for this tendency at present is, I think, the logical posi tivist's out of hand rejection of any non-confirmable or non-defeasible utterance that appears to be non-analytic, as cognitively meaningless. For the principle of verifiability has been and, to some extent still remains, a potent force in philosophy. The problem of distinguishing, in actual cases, between vague and non vague utterances becomes more acute when we consider that, with regard to ordinary expressions, there is no hard-and-fast demarcation-line between vagueness and non-vagueness. This is in sharp contrast to the situation that obtains with regard to many if not all mathematical and logical expressions. It is due to the presence of some flexibility or latitude in the ordinary correct applications of even the most patently non-vague ordinary expressions, as opposed to most or all mathematical or logical expressions. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish, with respect to the former expressions, bona fide vagueness. In other words, it is sometimes difficult to determine whether the actual applications of the particular expression are governed by suf ficiently specific and precise but nevertheless flexible rules; or whether they are governed, if at all, only by very general and imprecise rules which allow for the most diverse, even contradictory applications of the expression in specific contexts. For example, 'internationalism', 'positive neutralism' and 'active neutralism' are quite vague: but the first is definitely a common noun, and the second and third are phrases composed of a common noun qualified by an adjective. The latter two also definitely refer to some po litical and ideological position or viewpoint. But the former, which is clearly also political or ideological, may be in addition a cultural and a philo sophical position. The word 'communism', as it is currently employed in different parts of the world is, at least in some of its applications, less vague than the former three expressions. Yet it too is quite vague and is becoming more and more so with the passage of time. We understand more by the word than by any of the other expressions we mentioned; but far from enough even for practical purposes. The same lack of a sharp demarcation-line as noted above is discernible in regard to the boundaries between so-called hopelessly vague, or even very vague but not hopelessly vague, expressions and completely meaning 254</page><page sequence="7">VAGUENESS, VERIFIABILITY AND METAPHYSICS less, expressions. It is not that meaninglessness1 itself admits of degrees - it does not, despite the common employment of such epithets as 'completely', 'totally' or 'wholly' to qualify the word 'meaningless'.9 But an utterance may be so vague that the difference between it and a meaningless 1 utterance may be almost undetectable. The absence of a sharp demarcation-line between precise and vague ex pressions on the one hand and vague and meaningless, expressions on the other hand is one source of endless, sometimes perhaps unsolvable, controversies among scholars and philosophers. It is the source of endless debates about the clarity or unclarity of some metaphysical or other philo sophical utterance or "view", or about its meaningfulness I or utter meaning lessness,. We can therefore understand and sympathize with, even if we do not - as the present author does not - accept the logical positivist's impatient cutting of the Gordian knot with the overly sharp sword of the verifiability principle. II In Section I, I asserted that some traditional philosophical utterances are vague. I now wish to consider whether it is possible for traditional meta physics as actually conceived and practised to give us precise utterances; or whether it is doomed by its very nature either to vagueness - perhaps hopeless vagueness - or to complete cognitive meaninglessness. Since a complete answer to this question requires a careful and detailed analysis of the various types of metaphysical utterances, I shall limit myself here to a very general consideration of what I call "ontologistic" metaphysical assertions. I shall explore the logical implications, for our discussion of vagueness, of these particular kinds of assertions. In the first place, a metaphysical utterance - and the same applies to whole "views", "doctrines" or "theories" - may be either revisionary or non-revisionary.10 At the same time it may be, broadly speaking, either 9 I am using the word 'meaningless' in the sense in which "Jabberwocky is brillig" but not "Friday is in bed" is meaningless. We employ the epithets 'completely', 'totally' and 'wholly' for emphasis, in relation to utterances which we think are meaningless in the present sense, but which have the appearance of being meaningful as a whole. 10 The current distinction between "revisionary" and "descriptive" metaphysics, though quite useful, does not go far enough. Although it is not exclusive, it is not exhaustive at all. There are, or there can be, metaphysical utterances that possess cognitive meaning but are neither revisionary nor yet descriptive in the restricted sense in which the latter ex pression is nowadays employed; e.g. as referring to the kind of activity undertaken by P. F. Strawson in his Individuals. A metaphysical utterance may be quite conceivably framed in ordinary language, and so may utilize or presuppose the categorial structure or distinctions of everyday thinking, without being a statement about this categorial scheme or any particular part of it. 255</page><page sequence="8">HAIG KHATCHADOURIAN "this-worldly" or "other-worldly", in an inclusive sense of these expressions. That is, it may purport to be an assertion about nature as a whole or some part of it; or about an alleged supersensible, extra-empirical realm or some alleged part of it, respectively. The former type of utterance is exemplified by many of the metaphysical assertions of, say, Bertrand Russell or John Dewey - of Naturalistic metaphysicians as a whole. The former type of utterance is exemplified by many of the metaphysical assertions of Plato, Augustine, Aquinas and other Medieval philosophers, Descartes, Locke and Berkeley, Leibniz, many of the German and British Objective Idealists, and so on. There are, however, all sorts of intermediate positions in the history of philosophy - "views" which are not clearly supernaturalistic and yet not quite, or not wholly Naturalistic; e.g. the different forms of pantheism, panpsychism, panlogism or other forms of monism (in one sense of'monism'). Examples are the "views" of Bruno, Spinoza and Hegel; as well as the attenuated supernaturalism of Aristotle's metaphysics. For this reason, I shall replace the imprecise distinction between Naturalistic and Supernatur alistic, this-worldly and other-worldly metaphysics by the distinction between the following: (1) metaphysical utterances which are, or purport to be, about some sensible object or phenomenon, including kinaesthetic sensations, or some datum of direct non-sensory, "introspective" awareness; such as (psychic) feelings, emotions, or thoughts; and (2) those which are, or purport to be, about some third kind of object or phenomenon: usually some pur ported supersensible entity or set of entities that is alleged to "underlie" the sensible, physical world and (in some "views") cause it to exist. The philosophical theistic conception of God, Plato's Forms, Aristotle's Un moved Mover, Kant's Things-in-Themselves, Spinoza's God, and the Abso lute in its various forms in 19th century Idealism, all involve metaphysical claims about the existence and nature of alleged entities of the last kind. Such metaphysical claims I shall call ontologistic; and I shall also speak of ontologistic assertions, statements, or propositions. The opposite kind of metaphysical assertion I shall label non-ontologistic statements or propo sitions. It should be immediately added that I do not here differentiate between ontologistic "views" that do not claim, and those that claim, that the ex istence or the nature of the entities they posit can be known to man through some non-physical, non-sensory channel of experience; e.g. feeling (or special feelings), "intuition" (intellectual or emotional). Our distinction concerns the ontological status of the posited entity not, or not also, the way in which it can be known."1 It is clear, however, that the latter is in some ways dependent on the former. The essential point here is that those onto 11 However, ontologism in the traditional sense claims immediate knowledge of God on the level of intellectual "intuition", though not on the level of feeling or emotional "intuition". 256</page><page sequence="9">VAGUENESS, VERIFIABILITY AND METAPHYSICS logistic philosophers who hold that these alleged entities can be apprehended by means of feeling, emotion or thought do not go on from there to assert that they themselves are feelings, emotions, or thoughts. The greatest source of vague, as well as of meaningless metaphysical utterances is ontologism, which comprises the bulk of traditional meta physics. To come right to the crucial point and to state it very concisely, the metaphysician's first and fundamental problem here is to succeed in saying something which has clear meaning1, and which therefore can be about some (alleged) "ontological" entity: an utterance which is true or false. Nay, the problem prior even to this is that of being able to say some thing at all about its alleged object, of framing an utterance that has any meaning, at all. Because of limitations of space I shall confine my discussion chiefly to utterances that purport to make meaningful assertions about some supra sensible reality "underlying" the physical, sensible world and in some factual or logical way or other connected with it; such as being its proximate or ultimate source or cause. Platonic idealism, epistemological dualism, sub jective, critical and objective idealism immediately come to mind. The problem facing the metaphysician here is this: First, whether such metaphysical utterances necessarily involve, by virtue of their ontologistic character, some modification, or even perhaps the complete abandonment, of ordinary forms of expression and thought. Second, and consequently, whether the "revision" of ordinary forms of expression and thought in the case of ontologistic utterances does not lead to vagueness or to complete meaning lessness,. Whatever the complete answer to the first question may be, there is a strong presumption that, perhaps with the qualified exception of statements about God, ontologism is inescapably revisionary. For since, ex hypothesi, the metaphysician claims to have discovered some hitherto unknown entity or entities (e.g. Platonic Forms, the Absolute of a Hegel or a Schopenhauer, etc.) he must give us a new concept in terms of which he can express true propositions about the alleged entity or entities. (Also, in order to express the new concept, he must either coin a new word or give some ordinary word a new meaning.) This concept may not be completely different from any actual ordinary or scientific concept; but it cannot, it appears, be identical with any such concept. Where the new concept, X, is only a modi fication of an already-existent concept - ordinary or scientific - and the latter is the concept of something which exists or is believed to exist, "A", the modification effected in it will pertain to "A's" nature. The philosopher may (a) attribute new "essential" characteristics to "A", or (b) eliminate some of its "essential", "defining" characteristics. Or, finally, (c) he may do 257</page><page sequence="10">HAIG KHATCHADOURIAN both (a) and (b) above. Aristotle's and Spinoza's conceptions of God, to give only two examples, illustrate (c). Indeed, with regard to Spinoza, (b) is a logical consequence of (a). By identifying God and the universe conceived as Natura Naturans, Spinoza not only gives God qualities not included in the theistic conception of God (e.g. in Christianity), but also, in doing so, eliminates the property of transcendence and whatever other properties that go with it, from these concepts. On the other hand, the metaphysician may claim to have discovered some hitherto-unknown entity. An example is the epistemological dualist's claim that there is a knowable realm of entities, over and above the world of sensible objects, which underlies the latter. Or, finally, he may hold, as Kant and other agnostics do, that this suprasensible world is unknowable. In the former case the concept the metaphysician gives us may, likewise, be only partly new. For he may endow the extra-empirical entity or entities "Y" he claims to have discovered with qualities or properties some of which are found in one class of existing things or another, about which we meaning fully, speak in ordinary or in scientific contexts. Indeed, the characteristics attributed to "Y" may all be drawn from different classes of existing things: some from one class, others from another; and so on. Thus some contempo rary epistemological dualists attribute to the alleged independently existing material objects which they regard as the causes of perceived things, many if not all of the features which physics attributes to atomic or sub-atomic particles. They may even identify other non-sensible objects they posit with these "scientific objects" (Cf. A. O. Lovejoy); in which case they do not give us a new concept at all but merely adopt some extant scientific concept. On the other hand, a dualist such as Locke attributes primary qualities - qualities possessed by perceived objects - to the material objects he posits, together with qualities that perceived objects lack; viz. characteristics which prevent his material objects from being perceived by us. Locke also endows these objects with causal efficacy, which he likewise attributes to our volitions and to our mind as a whole qua capable of being acted upon by material objects themselves. (At the same time, his theory implicitly divests sensible objects of causal efficacy. For since they are "ideas", they must be causally otiose.) The situation is relatively uncomplicated where the metaphysician posits the existence of "I know not what": a Lockean material substance or Kantian things-in-themselves. For there only the existence of the entity in question is posited, with or without the additional assumption that it is different from anything we know, or can ever know. In the former case, only a "negative concept" can be formed of the entity in question; and this does not involve the modification of any ordinary or scientific concept. In the 258</page><page sequence="11">VAGUENESS, VERIFIABILITY AND METAPHYSICS latter case, it is hard to speak of the presence of any (new) concept at all. The same may even be said of the "negative concepts" I have just alluded to: for is this expression anything more or other than a label to mark the fact that we cannot be thinking of anything we know, or anything we can ever know, when we employ the "name" of the unknowable entity in question? Finally, the ontologistic metaphysician does not give us a partly or wholly new concept when he affirms the existence of some alleged entity which some or all men hitherto thought were merely possible. The belief in the existence of ghosts or spirits is a good example. However, since there is no general agreement among people as to what ghosts or spirits are like, or what they would be like if they existed, different people would give us different concepts of them. And that would considerably complicate the situation. The serious problem confronting the ontologist, whenever his position requires that he provide some partly or wholly new concept or concepts, is that of giving a clear, non-vague meaning to the words he uses to designate the entity or entities he posits or endows with new properties. The main source of this problem is the following: In order to give a non-vague meaning to these words, he must provide us with paradigm cases of their employment. But can he succeed in doing so? Since the alleged entity (or entities) is, ex hypothesi, extra-empirical in nature, he cannot do so by means of any ostensive "definitions". This includes the inability to give meaning to the words in question by appeal to some scientifically observed sensible or psychological fact or facts. If he holds that the posited extra-empirical entity is a (or the) cause of some particular sensible or psychological phe nomenon, or even of the sensible world as a whole, he may attempt to define his metaphysical expressions in terms of some of the observable characteristics of these phenomena. (Cf. Hobbes and Locke, who base this "definitional procedure" on the assumption that an effect must be like its cause.) The futility of such attempts of characterizing "unobservables" in terms of the characteristics of observed phenomena has been convincingly shown more than once in the history of philosophy; e.g. by Berkeley in his celebrated criticism of Locke's material substance. A more consistent and perspicacious position would appear to be Kantian agnosticism concerning the nature of the extra-empirical entities posited. (Even this agnosticism is not completely consistent, however; since the existence of the unknowable entity or entities is still maintained.) Yet the characterization of these entities in terms of the qualities of observable things is the only possible way of characterizing them! But even if some meaning is thus given to the expressions in question, this meaning will be, very frequently if not always, far from clear, precise. Locke's concept of material substances possessing primary qualities that are, 259</page><page sequence="12">HAIG KHATCHADOURIAN at the same time, non-sensible in principlel2 - objects which possess size, shape motion or rest, etc. but nonetheless cannot possibly be perceived by us - is again a good example. The upshot is that the ontologist is faced with a grave dilemma. In order to be intelligible at all, he must provide cognitive meanings for the philo sophical expressions he has to employ. This can only be done in terms of the characteristics of observable, empirical things. At the same time he threatens to undermine this attempt by conceiving the entities he wishes to talk about in such a way that the very conditions of the possibility of realizing his aim are eliminated. The entities in question are supposed to possess qualities that are sensible or perceptual by their very nature, and yet are not perceiva ble in principle! They are supposed to possess a hardness or a softness that cannot in principle feel hard or soft to any (at least not any human) observer. They are supposed to possess shape and size, but also to exist in an absolute space which is quite different in nature from the space we perceive, or in which sensible objects are ordinarily said to be located. And so on. In order to endow these alleged entities with some of the qualities of sensible objects or psychological phenomena, the metaphysician must conceive them as being objects or phenomena of the same kind, type or sort as the latter. At the same time he must conceive them as being of quite a different kind, type or sort from these things, in order that they may qualify for the meta physical and other roles he wishes to assign to them. This results in strange incongruities, bizarre mixtures of the familiar and the unfamiliar, internal inconsistencies or contradictions, anthropomorphism (in the cases of theistic conceptions of God) coupled with emphasis on transcendence, on (God's) otherness or difference; and so on. In the light of this we can say that the basic problem of religious theism - to take this as our example - is the semantic problem of giving meaning1 to the word 'God' if God is thought of as very different from man; or the problem of keeping God sufficiently different to be God and not man or superman (a magnified image of man), but without depriving 'God' of all meaning,. The problem is not really the supposed religious or theological problem of harmonizing between God's immanence (e.g. as Providence) and his transcendence. The attempted compromise between the two opposed forces all too often results in flagrant self-contradiction or extreme vagueness. Similarly, the religious or philosophical mystic's "inability" to describe 12 I am referring to the view most commonly expressed in the Essay; i.e. Locke's "repre sentative" theory of perception. I am not thinking of the half-way-house position which Locke sometimes appears to hold in that work: the view that we do perceive the primary qualities of material objects, but that we "project" onto the material objects perceived the mental "ideas" of color, odor, taste, sound, etc. which do not objectively inhere in them. 260</page><page sequence="13">VAGUENESS, VERIFIABILITY AND METAPHYSICS God, Ultimate Reality, or The One, and his appeal to analogy or to figur ative language is not due to the alleged poverty of our language, our concepts, our thought. It is rather due to the fact that God, Ultimate Reality, or The One are presumed to be vastly different from us or anything we know in nature; vastly superior to man or nature as a whole. Their "ineffableness" merely bespeaks the mystic's failure to make sense - or to make enough sense - when he thinks he is saying something profound about them. However, I should immediately add that the moral to be drawn from this is not, as the logical positivists and some other contemporary philos ophers think, that there cannot be (or even are not) any extra-empirical entities, utterly different from us and/or nature. The moral to be drawn, to my mind, is simply that we cannot - hence should not attempt to - speak at all, or cannot speak clearly, "about" anything that is presumed to be utterly different from us and/or nature. In both cases, we must follow Wittgenstein's famous injunction: "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent" - but without necessarily sharing the philosophical reasons which prompted Wittgenstein to say this, or the logical conclusions he draws from it. The inter-categorial violation of the meaning of ordinary expressions which is discernible in much of traditional metaphysics is now seen to be a consequence, in the case of ontologistic metaphysics, of the dilemma we spoke about a little earlier. The ontologistic metaphysician is (a) forced by the demands of intelligibility to envision the extra-empirical entities he posits (wherever he does so) as being of the same logical category as some (class of) sensible things or some (class of) psychological phenomena. But - and here the category violation comes in - his ontologism (b) frequently if not always compels him to envision these posited entities as being of a more or less different logical category from them - from anything else of an em pirical nature, for that matter. Thus he frequently exploits the customary cognitive meaning of ordinary or scientific expressions, giving the impression that he is saying something familiar, clear and perfectly proper, while actually performing a categorial "leap", drastically modifying the ordinary or sci entific meanings, in question. What is more, the pull of ontologism on him forces him to "leap" not merely from one ordinary or scientific category of thought to another, but clear out of all ordinary or scientific categories, into a categorial "vacuum". Or rather, he is lost between the force which tries to keep him within the categorial schemes of ordinary language or of science and the force which tries to pull him completely outside these schemes. Thus the extra-empirical entities he posits are very much like lost souls, wandering homeless, neither here (in nature) nor there (in an alleged "other world"). 261</page><page sequence="14">HAIG KHATCHADOURIAN We can restate our essential points in another way. The revisionary ontologist, insofar as he may employ ordinary and/or scientific expressions in talking about his alleged supra-empirical entities, cuts these expressions from the contexts in which they are normally used, and in which they "move and have their being". He uproots them from these contexts, their natural habitat, the matrix in which - and in which alone - they mean whatever they do mean, and applies them to objects or situations to which they were not intended to apply in the first place. In so doing our metaphysician gives the impression of saying something meaningful, - or fully meaningful, - about the new "objects" to which he purports to apply these expressions; by virtue of the fact that the latter do have, in their original contexts, a clear and definite meaning. But it is the appearance of meaningfulness that he succeeds in giving, not a new, or not a clear new meaning. The situation is not unlike this, in its net outcome, where the ontologist largely invents his own terminology. For he must of necessity draw on the features of observable things in order to provide his expressions with factual meaning and therefore make them relevant to actually existing things. And we saw how such an attempt fares. But further. Though the metaphysician here does not modify ordinary or scientific expressions themselves, since he avoids using them altogether, what he does has a bearing on ordinary and/or scientific language. For the observable features of empirical objects that are to provide the necessary meaning-basis for his new expressions have, almost invariably, some ordinary and/or scientific name. This in itself would not mean much - except for the fact that the ontologist, in applying his new expressions to (alleged) extra-empirical entities, necessarily effects a fundamental change in the character of these features insofar as they enter into this meaning-base. For we saw earlier that in transposing these charac teristics outside nature, he eliminates some or all of the conditions under which alone they are customarily said to be the features they are. Thus the metaphysician's moves, in the last analysis, have pretty much the logical effect on language that they would have if and when he actually modifies ordinary and/or scientific language. The description we have been giving of the way in which language is employed by the revisionary ontologist applies, though in a somewhat attenuated form, where the metaphysician defines his key expressions in terms of some features of empirical objects - only conceived as indefinitely magnified, as existing in a "perfect" degree. Also, some of our remarks, though not all, apply to non-ontologistic metaphysical utterances; for instance, to utterances about the universe as a whole. Both of these types of instances can be illustrated by considering, in the first case, the traditional theistic conception of God's attributes; and in the second case, the traditional 262</page><page sequence="15">VAGUENESS, VERIFIABILITY AND METAPHYSICS arguments for God's existence. Thus in the Christian conception, God is regarded as the repository of all possible perfections - of omnipotence, omniscience, love, justice, mercy and so on. These attributes are indefinite augmentations of the "finite", "imperfect" attributes of power, knowledge, love, justice, mercy, etc. encountered in human beings and their experiences. In their "imperfect" form, they are compatible with the human, and certainly the natural, evil present in the world. Indeed, the existence of human evil itself is explicable in the light of man's "imperfect" goodness. Once these qualities are attributed to God in a perfect form, however, the celebrated Problem of Evil immediately arises. God's omniscience and benevolence, though certainly compatible with each other, become together incompatible with the actual existence of evil - of imperfection as a whole - in the universe. In other words, the incompatibility arises between the attribution to a single entity of both omnipotence and benevolence, and the creation and sustenance of an imperfect world (the latter being other attributes of God). A number of the "solutions" of this Problem revolve round the elimination, from the concept of God, of one or more of these attributes (creation, omnipotence). As it stands, the concept of God as both omnipotent and benevolent, and creator ofan imperfect world, is logically inconsistent. This inconsistency is clearly due to the attribution of the foregoing qualities to things outside the contexts in which they normally arise in human experience. For in human experience they only exist in an "imperfect" degree. However, it is not due to the sheer indefinite augmentation of each of the qualities in question, taken by itself. It is rather due to the concentration, in a single being, of all these attributes together, conceived as indefinitely or infinitely augmented. The situation is thus interestingly different from the way in which (say) the qualities of sensible objects fare when they are attributed to the extra-empirical material objects of Locke or other epistemological dualists. The latter type of situation is encountered in other conceptions of "ulti mate reality" or the "ultimate ground of all being"; e.g. in Plotinus' The One. To quote Etienne Gilson: "Strictly speaking, he [The One] is un namable because he cannot be described. Any attempt at expressing him must of necessity result in a judgment, and since a judgment is made up of several terms, we cannot say what the One is without turning his unity into some sort of multiplicity, that is, without destroying it. Let us say then that he is the One, not as a number that can enter the composition of other numbers, nor as synthesis of other numbers, but as the self-subsisting unity whence all multiplicity follows without affecting in the least its absolute simplicity." 13 13 God and Philosophy, New Haven, 1955, pp. 45-6. Italics mine. 263</page><page sequence="16">HAIG KHATCHADOURIAN Here we can see a clear example of the elimination of the very conditions under which alone the ordinary words 'one' and 'many' make sense: The One is one, but unlike any unity we know; it is nonetheless not many, though it is the source of plurality! (There is an obvious similarity between this and the point often made nowadays that the doctrinal sceptic rejects the possibility of knowledge because he rejects the ordinary criteria of know ledge; i.e., the conditions that must be fulfilled for anything to be called knowledge. In rejecting them, the sceptic will also be rejecting the conditions that must be absent so that something may not be said to be knowledge at all.) A number of the classical arguments for God's existence, on the other hand, illustrate the "extension" of the application of ordinary words in order to make them designate or refer to objects to which they do not ordinarily apply. This is also what frequently happens in the case of non ontologistic metaphysical assertions. In the cosmological "argument" the metaphysician applies the ordinary concepts of cause and effect to the universe as a whole, on the basis of real or imaginary similarities between particular occurrences and the universe as a whole; i.e., on the basis of an analogy. Hence he speaks of the universe as a whole as the effect of something beyond the universe. Similarly with the application of the concepts of order, purpose or design to the universe as a whole in the teleological "argument". A cosmic designer or Architect is "inferred" from this assumed "orderliness" of the universe as a whole. The metaphysician here "extends" these ordinary concepts drastically, on the basis of certain similarities that he allegedly discerns, minimizing or completely ignoring the greater and more fundamental dissimilarities or disanalogy present. But in doing this, the metaphysician really modifies the ordinary concepts of cause and effect, order, design, purpose, etc; and as a result of the dissimilarities or disanalogy really involved, these concepts become either completely vacuous, self-inconsistent or vague, depending on the magnitude and nature of the dissimilarities as opposed to the re semblances involved. For instance, the argument for an Unmoved Mover in Aristotle does less violence to the ordinary concepts of cause and effect than the cosmological argument for the existence of a creator of the universe. For one thing, the latter speaks of the universe itself as the "effect" of God's creative activity. It does not, in contrast to the former argument, continue to apply the concepts of cause and effect to happenings, events or occurrences. If it did it could not, by any show of reason, speak of the cause of the universe in the sense of its creator, rather than of the initiator of change in it. I said that the foregoing examples illustrate the "extension" of ordinary concepts - here cause and effect, order, purpose, etc. I used the word in quotation marks because the metaphysician attempts to apply these concepts 264</page><page sequence="17">VAGUENESS, VERIFIABILITY AND METAPHYSICS to objects to which they do not normally apply; while he also continues to apply what he regards as the same concepts in the customary way: to objects to which they normally do apply. In reality, however, he modifies the ordinary concepts or, more exactly, replaces them with partly similar con cepts. Since these concepts continue to be applied in the usual way, the metaphysician's move constitutes a further example of the attempt to provide us with new concepts. His concepts, if they apply to anything at all; i.e., if they are precise and consistent concepts, apply to other things than those to which their counterparts in ordinary language apply, not to these as well as to the latter. It is instructive to note here the differences between the metaphysician's above use of cause and effect (also order) and the genuine extension of an ordinary open-textured concept definitely to include some "borderline" case or cases. Although the latter cannot be consistently done without somewhat modifying the concept in question, this modification does not empty it of all or most of its original contents. It is precisely because of this that the concept can now definitely include the erstwhile "borderline" cases. For one thing, the original paradigm cases of its application are not affected by the inclusion of these new objects. Only some or all of the non-paradigm but nonetheless non-borderline objects are affected; and then only in a special sense. None of them ceases to be subsumed under the concept. Only certain resemblances which they have to the borderline cases and which were hitherto not criteria-features of the concept's correct application now become criteria-features. Correlatively, certain dissimilarities between the two cease to count against the subsumption of the latter under the concept. That is, certain features which the non-borderline cases possess but which our borderline cases lack cease to function as criteria-features for an object's being subsumed or not subsumed under the concept. Now it might be thought - and it has been suggested by some contempo rary philosophers - that revisionary metaphysical statements can be regarded as so many metaphorical utterances. If this is true, it would obviously not do to attribute vagueness to any metaphysical assertions just because the words they employ are not used in their customary literal meaning. This is not to say, however, that some metaphors themselves cannot be condemned as resting on vague or far-fetched resemblances (though we do not ordinarily speak of metaphors themselves as vague or non-vague). The view that metaphysical utterances are really metaphors is lent plausi bility by the fact that the revisionary metaphysician is forced to employ analogies with observable things in order to give substance to the words he uses. But this is where the similarity ends. A metaphor has meaning in an ordinary, straightforward sense of meaning: it has a figurative or derivative 265</page><page sequence="18">HAIG KHATCHADOURIAN meaning (in one sense of 'derivative'). And this meaning can be roughly stated in literal language, in terms of expressions that possess cognitive meaning. One can, for instance, "translate" "He is a lion of a man" into "He has the courage of a lion" or "He is very courageous". The situation is not different in principle in more complicated cases. But if what we have said about the revisionary metaphysician's utterances is correct, these cannot be stated without residue - or sometimes, they cannot be stated at all - in any meaningful, or any precise, literal statement or statements. A metaphor expresses dramatically, in a vivid or imaginative way a particular object's possession of a certain feature which is already known or believed to exist in it, and which it shares with other things as well. But the whole point of revisionary metaphysical utterances is that they involve, or logically follow from, an implicit or explicit inference by analogy. In some cases the analogy proceeds as follows: Some empirical object or phenomenon A possesses, or is believed to possess, observable features a, b, c, etc. The metaphysician sup poses (frequently on the basis of some prior analogy with the nature or behavior of certain observable things) that we must posit the existence of some extra-empirical object B, and must assume that it possesses certain unobservable features a, P, y, etc. Now A also possesses or is believed to possess a further feature d, which is (believed to be) essentially linked with a, b, c, etc. The metaphysician therefore concludes, by analogy, that B possesses a further unobservable feature A very similar to d. The inference, being analogical, cannot demonstrate B's possession of A. However, the metaphysician illicitly interprets it as a bona fide demonstration, not as a mere hypothesis to be verified. This is in tenor with the traditional meta physician's generally dogmatic, a priorist approach. Moreover, what other attitude could the committed metaphysician take to such inferences? For how can we ever possibly observe or detect the existence or non-existence of A in B and thus verify or disverify the metaphysician's claim? For instance, how can we possibly observe or detect the existence or non-existence of "purpose", "design" or "order" in the universe as a whole; or observe the universe being "acted" upon by some extra-empirical entity or entities? It is this fact which the verifiability principle seizes upon and makes the basis of its rejection of metaphysical utterances that purport to be about some unobservable object or objects. But further, the foregoing "metaphysical analogy" and all other onto logistic arguments by analogy are logically invalid. For example, in order that the above argument may be, strictly speaking, valid it must be assumed that a, p, y, etc. are qualitatively the same as a, b, c, etc.; and the plausi bility of what is really the hypothesis it involves is in inverse ratio to the dissimilarity between a, B, y, etc. on the one hand and a, b, c, etc. on the 266</page><page sequence="19">VAGUENESS, VERIFIABILITY AND METAPHYSICS other hand. But the ontologist once more finds himself in the dilemma we pointed out earlier. If he wishes to preserve the extra-empirical character of B and its characteristics, he undermines his ontologistic argument or, at the very best, drastically weakens it. Indeed, it becomes exceedingly hard for him to say anything meaningful about B and its properties. If, on the other hand, he argues in accordance with a logically valid analogy, he is forced to make the object of his inference empirical, all too empirical to suit his ontologistic aims!
