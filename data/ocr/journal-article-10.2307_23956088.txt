<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS III Richard Richard de Saint-Victor et 1'idee chretienne de Γ amour. By Gervais Dumeige. Pp. 200. Paris: Presses universitaires de France, 1952. This book originated in a thesis, prepared beiore the war; the author returned to it after five years in a prisoners' camp. Interest in the Victorines is increasing. He has benefited from discussion with specialists in the same field and has had access to some unpublished studies. Readers will savour a work which is 'done to a turn'. One can not hurry over Richard of Saint Victor. He is a difficult׳ writer since he presents his ideas mainly in the form of commentaries on the mystical sense of Scripture. Fr. Dumeige has collected and interpreted the teach ing on Christian love which plays a central part in Richard's theology and mysticism, but is scattered throughout his writings. A glance at the footnotes will show what a formidable card-index lies behind the exposi tion. There is a useful bibliography and an appendix giving the few known details about Richard's life and a provisional chronology of his works. The latter is too uncertain to admit of a study of his development; hence his doctrine must be presented systematically, if at all. The author has reconstructed the system and investigated its sources. He has also thought about Richard as a person. He points out the gaps in the argu ment, as well as its inner cohesion, without trying to fill them with his own hypotheses. He shows that the key to an understanding of Richard is to study his milieu. The school of Saint Victor differed from all others in the second and third quarters of the twelfth century by its blend of intellectual activity with religious discipline and asceticism. The masters were surprisingly diverse and individual in their outlook, but devotion to Scripture as the basis of study provided a common element. As Fr. Dumeige points out, the content of Richard's thought was as biblical as its expression. The reproach of anthropomorphism which has been brought against him springs from the fact that 'le Dieu de Richard est le Dieu de la Revelation. C'est a dire, a s'en tenir aux termes de la Bible, un Dieu qui aime, s'irrite, est jaloux de sa gloire, un Dieu vivant . . . Richard ne pretend pas parler autremeht que l'ficriture.' The use of subtle dialectic to order what were essentially non-philosophical con cepts makes Richard's thought unique. The author tends to be careless about historical details which do not bear directly on his argument. Although he quotes Croydon, 'Notes on the Life of Hugh of Saint Victor' (J.T.S. xl (1939), 232-53), he still says confidently that Hugh came from Saxony; Mr. Croydon has shown that this is unsupported by contemporary evidence. The Cistercian monk who was corrected for having learnt Hebrew letters from a Jew came from Poblet in Catalonia, not Clairvaux, as the author states</page><page sequence="2">112 REVIEWS (see J.
