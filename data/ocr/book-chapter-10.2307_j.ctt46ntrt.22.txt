<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> t h I r t e e n Techniques of  Figure Enhancement in   Paleolithic Cave Art  IntroductIon Not so very many years ago, the primary aim of  those studying Paleolithic art was  to catalogue it, to define different styles, and to arrange them (based on superposi- tion and the “logic” of  stylistic evolution) in a developmental sequence (Breuil 1974).  Sometimes, artistic depictions were convincingly interpreted as faithful reflections  of  the external environment (González Echegaray 1974) or, less convincingly, as  enigmatic representations of  religious symbols (Luquet 1926). From the totally a  priori premise that the Paleolithic artist was only rarely capable of  conceptualiz- ing multifigure compositions (groups were explained as simple juxtapositions), the  isolated individual depiction was ordinarily the datum for investigation (Breuil and  Lantier 1959: 245; Hawkes 1963: 197). Most prehistorians recognized that one aim  of  Paleolithic art was to convey information to the artists’ contemporaries. But it  was only belatedly, after the stimulation of  Annette Laming-Emperaire (1962) and  André Leroi-Gourhan (1964, 1965: 110, 194), that there was any general awareness  that Paleolithic figures often occur in meaningful associations, or that informa- tion about the complementarity or opposition of  meaning might be gleaned from  a study of  grouping and the spatial relations between figures or compositions. As  Leroi-Gourhan himself  observed, despite the difficulties in dating parietal art, the  295 </page> <page sequence="2"> 296 technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art figures on cave walls are still in the places where prehistoric men put them, and their  placement and associations imply something about their meaning (Leroi-Gourhan  1964: 8, 82). Most prehistorians who have tried to get at aspects of  the significance of  pre- historic art from a firsthand study of  its documents will have noticed that certain  figures, by virtue of  their anomalous treatment, stand out from the rest of  the depic- tions accompanying them. It seems very likely that these figures have been singled  out to call particular attention to their special meaning. They may even be foci to- wards which other information encoded in a set of  figures is directed. But, whatever  its motivation, the enhancement of  particular figures deserves the especial attention  of  the investigator, even if  the analysis does not lead in any obvious way to clearer  conclusions about the depictions as a whole. A discussion of  Paleolithic figure enhancement will at least provide a basis for  more detailed comparisons of  artistic conventions at different times and places. We  may even hope that such a study might potentially add to a corpus of  evidence of   eventual utility in comparing and contrasting the mental processes of  particular  Paleolithic and modern groups. To the best of  my knowledge, Paleolithic figure enhancement techniques have  not before been catalogued, although most interested specialists have a more or less  impressionistic feel for them, and certain have been discussed by others in some  detail. The most meticulous and thorough treatment of  some aspects of  the topic to  date is contained in André Leroi-Gourhan’s The Dawn of  European Art (1982), though  enhancement as such is not specifically discussed in that work. This chapter presents a rough sketch of  some commonly observed devices used  by Paleolithic artists to give particular features special impact. Though it enumerates  the techniques I am aware of, it must still be incomplete; it is published in the full  expectation that it will be criticized, amplified, modified, or rejected by my more  knowledgeable colleagues. I hope that in the process we will all be led somewhat  closer to an understanding of  Paleolithic art. Figure enhancement is a process that involves both the artistic depiction and  the perceptual apparatus of  the viewer. It does not exist without the participation  of  both. Consequently, the recognition and appreciation of  particular techniques  of  figure enhancement can never be entirely objective; an element of  subjective  judgment is always involved. Provided that the judgmental element is informed, the  process is not stigmatized. There are many complex problems of  qualitative evalua- tion and pattern recognition that are more rapidly and effectively done by the human  analyst than by the most elaborate “objective” electronic computer in existence. It is  interesting to note that the creative aspect of  mathematics, too, is the discovery of   systems or theorems by plausible reasoning or informed guesswork. Only after the  creative phase can one proceed to quantitative proof  of  the theorem by the objec- tive, rigidly formalized procedures of  demonstrative mathematical reasoning (Polya  1973). Pattern recognition and evaluation are among the many areas where the di- chotomy between “art” and “science” proves false, where scientist and humanist are  one. </page> <page sequence="3"> Many figure-enhancement procedures are notable only when a single figure or  group is examined in the total context of  its relationships to other depictions, or  to the topography and surface conditions of  the walls, ceilings, and floors of  the  galleries where it is found. Thus, for definition of  enhancement techniques, three  elements are always involved: the depictions viewed, the surroundings in which  they are viewed, and the impact they produce on the viewer. It might reasonably  be objected that a depiction would have meant very different things to a Paleolithic  observer than it means to a modern one. Animals must have meant something quite  different to those who depended on the hunt for their daily survival than they mean  to the prehistorian raised and trained in today’s urban industrial world. There is no  doubt that some aspects of  the meaning of  Paleolithic figures can never be recov- ered. But it is a fact that many Paleolithic animal figures are recognizable and even  judged realistic by a modern viewer. What is more, as the student learns more about  the depicted animals and their behavior, seemingly irrelevant or inexplicable details  of  the Paleolithic figures are seen to be reliable indications of  coat condition, or ste- reotyped activity appropriate to a particular season, a temporary phase of  develop- ment, or cyclic behavioral phenomena. These observations show that no wide gulf  separates the perceptual apparatus  of  Paleolithic artist and modern viewer. When certain figures stand out strikingly  from the ordinary run of  depictions in a site, gallery, or composition, from our point  of  view, we may assume that the artists also recognized their unusual character,  whether they consciously intended the figures to stand out or not, and regardless of   the deeper symbolic meaning of  the enhanced depictions. It is very possible that on  occasion the nature and relationships of  an enhanced figure and the technique of   enhancement might indicate aspects of  its symbolic content or directions of  further  research that would lead to future understandings of  its value. For present purposes,  however, that possibility is of  no immediate concern; my principal aim is the catego- rization of  the techniques, not the elucidation of  motives and meanings.  a PrelImInary catalogue of  enhancement technIques Isolation No one can fail to have noted that viewing figures that have been hidden away in  inaccessible nooks, pits, or galleries, or unexpectedly coming upon figures after pass- ing through long passageways that are completely devoid of  art, heightens the view- ing experience and our appreciation of  the art. It strongly suggests that the figures  were intended to be out of  the ordinary, even though they may be sketchily rendered  or technically and stylistically average for the site. The line drawings in the puits at  Lascaux draw our attention by their isolation, reinforcing the impact of  their un- usual subject matter (Leroi-Gourhan and Allain 1979; Laming 1959). The same may  be said of  the figures in the cupola at La Pasiega and the narrow scutiform-lined pas- sage at the end of  a gallery at the same site (Breuil, Obermaier, and Alcalde del Río  1913). (Many other cases are known, but I intend here simply to give one or a few  technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art 297 </page> <page sequence="4"> 298 technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art illustrative examples of  each technique, rather than attempting the kind of  exhaus- tive listing that only someone far more expert in the specialty could provide.) size Figures that are either very much larger or much smaller than other depictions nearby  attract our interest because of  the size contrast. Figures such as the polychrome  hind on the ceiling of  the Sala Grande at Altamira stand apart from the rest of  the  polychromes in relative or comparative size; the polychromes contrast in relative size  with the smaller outline and monochrome figures on the same ceiling and adjacent  wall. The size of  the polychrome figures is also impressive in a more nearly absolute  sense, however. They are quite large, and when viewed from the contemporary gal- lery floor, which brings the viewer’s eye very close to most of  the paintings, give  an impression of  much greater size (Breuil and Obermaier 1935). The viewer can  feel almost overwhelmed by their scale. From most observer positions, complete  overviews of  figures in their integrity are difficult or impossible to attain, since one  cannot easily stand back far enough from them to take them in. Some of  the human  heads at the Cueva de Hoz (Barandiarán et al. 1981) are monumental in scale in an  absolute sense; considerably larger than a human viewer, they produce a similar,  awesome effect. The disproportionate size of  the large bulls in the main hall and  axial gallery at Lascaux (Bataille 1955: 50–90; Leroi-Gourhan and Allain 1979) is an- other obvious example. attitude Certain animal figures are arranged in postures or attitudes that contrast notably  with other figures in their surroundings or with what the viewer supposes to be the  “normal” pose of  an animal at rest. Sometimes, as in the case of  the “leaping” cow  above the frieze of  little horses in Lascaux’s axial gallery (Bataille 1955: 85), an animal  may be pictured at the height of  some exaggerated action, legs violently doubled or  stretched and extended. Other examples are the galloping horse at Font de Gaume  (Breuil 1974: 82) and the galloping bison, formerly misidentified as a wild boar, on  the great ceiling at Altamira (Freeman 1978: 171). Sometimes animals are shown upside down, feet in the air, or in other unusual  postures, suggesting that they are falling. There is such a “falling” horse at Lascaux in  the axial gallery (Bataille 1955: 81), and a head-down, vertical bison at Altxerri (Altuna  and Apellániz 1976: 63; Leroi-Gourhan 1982: fig. 68). On the other hand, there are  depictions of  attitudes that are less agitated but nevertheless striking. At San Román  de Candamo (Hernández-Pacheco 1919: 61, 62) two stags are shown with necks  outstretched, open-mouthed, in the stereotyped “belling” posture of  the rut. One  (perhaps both) is shown transfixed by spears. Another stag, apparently riddled by  wounds, turns his head to look back, possibly at his pursuers (Hernández-Pacheco  1919: 64). At Covalanas, a group of  does is shown with heads raised and ears pricked  </page> <page sequence="5"> up expectantly. One turns her head to look behind her (Alcalde del Río, Breuil, and  Sierra 1912; Apellániz 1982: 72). Although there is no indication of  agitation in these  figures, an attitude of  tense vigilance prior to flight is perfectly conveyed. In the case of  the stags from San Román, just mentioned, the mooing poly- chrome bison cow on the ceiling of  the Great Hall of  Altamira, shown with back  arched and tail upraised (Breuil and Obermaier 1935), or the engraving of  a female  bison mounting a male in the final gallery at the same site (Freeman 1978: 175), the  attitudes depicted are stereotypical postures that characterize animals in breeding  condition. In this case, the “enhancement” of  the animal figures conveys informa- tion to the viewer about their condition. Since they are seasonal breeders, one aspect  of  this information has implications about seasonality, suggesting that the artist was  concerned with, and particularly intended reference to, a specific temporal period.  Of  course, the season depicted need not necessarily have been the season when the  work was executed. omission Some figures are made more noticeable by the omission of  part of  the body. Jordá has  described a composition of  headless deer and bovids from Los Pedroses in Asturias  (1977: 75, 124–26), unusual in that it includes so many figures subjected to this treat- ment. Several other painted caves contain one or a few headless animals. Bodiless heads  are also well represented: the small black outline horse’s head from Las Chimeneas  in the Castillo complex in Santander, the finger-engraved heads of  deer and bovids  on other panels at the same site, are familiar examples (González Echegaray 1963).  Sometimes, just the forequarters or hindquarters of  an animal are depicted; the for- mer technique is also represented at Las Chimeneas as well as elsewhere. We must distinguish between three kinds of  incomplete figures, however.  Deliberate omissions, such as those just discussed, must be separated from figures  which were originally complete, only to lose parts by fading, leaching, or surface  alteration of  the rock; they should also be differentiated from figures produced by  the following technique. shadow completion In this case, the figure of  an animal is incompletely indicated by painting or engrav- ing. The missing parts are supplied, or better suggested, by shadows from irregu- larities of  the natural rock surface, under appropriate illumination. The technique  is more common than is usually supposed. The dorsal line and hindquarters of  a  large deer or bovid at Covalanas are shown in this way (Alcalde del Río, Breuil, and  Sierra 1912: plates 13 and 14). At Castillo, a fissure forms the back of  a black outline  bison and irregularities on a stalagmitic column form the hump, back, tail, and hind- quarters of  another almost sculptural bison, partly engraved and partly painted, and  depicted in a strange vertical attitude (Alcalde del Río, Breuil, and Sierra 1912: plates  84–86). A bison at Tito Bustillo is formed in this way. Virtually its whole outline is  technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art 299 </page> <page sequence="6"> 300 technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art suggested by the shape of  the natural rock surface, and decoration serves only to fill  in detail (de Balbin and Moure 1981: plate 1). The dorsal line of  a bison at Ekain is  suggested by the same technique (Altuna and Apellániz 1978: photo 14B). The beak,  eye, and chest of  a bird at La Pasiega are also suggested in like fashion. Sometimes, irregular projections from cave walls or ceiling suggest animal  heads or grotesque “masks,” like those at Castillo and Altamira (Alcalde del Río,  Breuil, and Sierra 1912: plates 85 and 86; Breuil and Obermaier 1935). At Niaux,  three cup-shaped natural depressions suggest wounds on a bison’s flanks (Breuil  1974 [1952]: 192), and a cavity, “completed” with black antlers, suggests the head  of  a deer (Leroi-Gourhan 1982: fig. 37). Perhaps the use of  rounded bosses to give a  three-dimensional quality to the polychrome bison at Altamira should be considered  a variant of  this procedure. The technique, wherever it occurs, couples a mastery of  form and the media of   execution with an admirable economy of  means. Its use was extremely widespread,  as I have already noted. caprice This is the first of  three categories of  deformed figures. Under this rubric I include  deformations that produce unrecognizable animals or nonexistent monsters of   all kinds and hybrids. To be judged a caprice, an unrecognizable animal has to be  shown in sufficient detail to permit its recognition were it a real, living creature, so  its ambiguity springs not from omission of  relevant detail but from distortion. The  “Licorne” at Lascaux is doubtless the best-known example (Breuil 1974 [1952]: fig.  89; Bataille 1955: 30, 49, 62). I find the suggestion that this is actually intended to be  a Tibetan antelope totally unconvincing—its horns project forward, not backward as  in Pantholops, body shape and coat color are all wrong, and the chunky, square snout  is totally unlike the graceful, elongated muzzle of  the antelope (see Walker 1964:  1464 for an illustration of  Pantholops). Hybrids combine in one depiction the features of  two or more recognizable  animals. The most familiar of  these are anthropomorphic bodies with animal-like  heads, such as the so-called sorcerers at Les Trois Frères (Breuil 1974 [1952]: 164,  166) and Gabillou (Leroi-Gourhan 1965: plate 58). The three published “masks” of   Altamira apparently depict bison, but each is ambiguous enough to suggest human  features at the same time (Breuil and Obermaier 1935: fig. 32, plate L; Ripoll 1980:  48; Leroi-Gourhan 1965: plates 402–4). The recently discovered stone face at el Juyo  (González Echegaray and Freeman 1981, 1982; Freeman and González Echegaray  1981) is a human-feline hybrid, interesting in that its two natures are laterally differ- entiated. The so-called ornithocephalic anthropomorphic figures that appear with  relative frequency in Paleolithic art should be included in this category if  they are  convincingly bird-headed, but the beaked appearance of  at least some of  the figures,  like those at Addaura (Leroi-Gourhan 1965: plate 710), may simply result from a de- sire to make human features unrecognizable by summary rendition of  the face. The  head of  the anthropomorph from the pit at Lascaux is so similar to the head of  the  </page> <page sequence="7"> bird on the staff  or spear-thrower beside him that he, at least, must be classed with  the hybrids (Bataille 1955). caricature This second category includes those figures which, though deformed, are neither  hybrids nor anamorphoses (see below) and remain generally recognizable though  distorted. It is often hard or impossible to tell, when considering a distorted figure,  whether it was simply clumsily executed or really intentionally distorted. If  the lat- ter, it may be difficult to tell whether the distortion is a manifestation of  a wide- spread stylistic convention or a means of  singling out specific figures for emphasis. There are, however, two rules of  thumb for recognizing stylistic conventions  that are valid for more recent artistic products, and might be expected to have valid- ity for Paleolithic products as well. First, a stylistic convention for the depiction of   a particular creature should be similarly represented each time that creature is por- trayed by artists sharing the convention. So, one might expect that when distortion is  used as a stylistic convention one would find that several animals of  the same sort in  a site are distorted in the same ways. If  that is not the case, stylistic convention can- not be absolutely ruled out, but seems a less probable explanation. Secondly, while  stylistic conventions unify the members of  the artistic community sharing them,  they simultaneously serve to differentiate that group from others. Any artistic phe- nomenon that has near-universal distribution and extreme longevity is not likely to  be a stylistic convention. The frequency with which the facial features are distorted in Paleolithic depic- tions of  humans (Abramova 1966) strongly suggests a conscious or unconscious re- sistance to “naturalistic” rendition of  those features. Despite claims to the contrary,  there is no convincing portraiture in Paleolithic art. All human depictions of  the  time are noticeably distorted. Human depictions thus form the clearest, most con- vincing set of  caricatures. The frontal view of  a human face from Marsoulas (Leroi-Gourhan 1964: plate  59) is an evident caricature. Features sketchy, malformed, and “cartoon”-like, it is  nonetheless perfectly evident that a human visage was intended. Certain human  faces from La Marche (Pales and Tassin de Saint-Péreuse 1976: plates 5–6) and Trois  Frères (Breuil 1974 [1952]) are caricatures in similar fashion, as are the human heads  from Fontanet (Delteil, Durbas, and Wahl 1972). Convincing examples of  caricatured animals are not difficult to find. But, the  near-universality of  caricature in rendering human features makes anthropomor- phic figures the clearest and most obvious manifestations of  caricature as a figure- enhancement device. anamorphosis This is a most interesting and potentially informative category of  deformations. Ana- morphosis is the systematic distortion of  a figure to make it appear either unrec- technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art 301 </page> <page sequence="8"> 302 technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art ognizable or extremely deformed, but is different from other deformations in that  when examined from one particular angle or when viewed with the appropriate ap- paratus, such as a curved mirror, the distortion disappears and the figures resume a  more naturalistic appearance (Baltrusaitis 1969; Leeman 1976; Lanners 1977: 52–55).  For present purposes, cylindrical anamorphoses and others intended to be viewed  with mirrors may be ignored, since there are no known examples in Paleolithic art,  nor are there Paleolithic mirrors. Two-dimensional linear anamorphoses may be regular or progressive. In regu- lar linear anamorphosis, measurements of  the figure depicted are greatly exagger- ated in one dimension, compared to the other. When the depiction is tilted, to bring  it more closely parallel with the line of  sight, and viewed along the exaggerated  dimension, the distortion apparently vanishes. In progressive anamorphosis, distor- tion progressively increases in parts of  the depiction that are further away from the  intended viewpoint. Regular linear anamorphoses will appear normal from either of   two opposite viewpoints, but a progressive anamorphosis is designed to be viewed  from just one position and in one direction only. The polychrome hind on the ceil- ing of  the Great Hall at Altamira (Leroi-Gourhan 1964: plate 109) seems to be a  progressive anamorphosis. The degree of  distortion in the figure is relatively small,  but the hind looks much more naturalistic when viewed from a position in front of   and below her elongated muzzle. Among the anthropomorphic figures engraved  on small objects from La Madeleine are at least two that seem anamorphic (Capitan  and Peyrony 1928: fig. 30, no. 3, fig. 30 bis; Leroi-Gourhan 1964: plates 440 and 442).  Several of  the human heads from La Marche are convincing anamorphoses (Pales  and Tassin de Saint-Péreuse 1976). Some years ago, in a conversation with John Pfeiffer, I mentioned that I thought  these La Marche faces and the Altamira hind were anamorphoses, and in his recent  book The Creative Explosion (1982: 42), Pfeiffer extends that interpretation to the fig- ure of  a horse at Tito Bustillo and the head of  a bull at Lascaux. In fact, several of   the Lascaux paintings seem anamorphic, particularly the black-headed red cow in  the axial gallery and the black horse with engraved outline in the nave (Bataille 1955:  73, 97). There is some justification for suspecting anamorphism whenever an animal  is depicted with anomalously small or excessively elongated body parts, particularly  if  the body and the hindquarters are very large and robust while head and neck are  elongated and small. The recognition of  anamorphoses in Paleolithic art came to me as a shock, since  I had been taught that, like recognition of  the vanishing point and the discovery of   linear perspective, anamorphosis was an artistic innovation of  the Renaissance and  that the oldest preserved examples are Leonardo da Vinci’s sketches of  an eye and a  child’s face from the Codex Atlanticus (ca. AD 1480). There are, of  course, differences  between Paleolithic and Renaissance anamorphoses. Da Vinci and his successors ap- parently constructed their anamorphoses with a proportional grid, developed from  an understanding of  regular geometric constructional principles, incorporating pre- cise mathematical rules for perspective depiction. No such rigorous system was uti- lized by Paleolithic artists, nor was one needed. Perfectly effective anamorphoses can  </page> <page sequence="9"> be constructed entirely by eye, by a lone artist if  the decorated space is small enough,  or by an artist and an assistant if  it is larger. In the latter case the artist, occupying  the position that the viewer will later be obliged to take, simply projects his vision of   the figure against the background, and has an assistant mark a number of  points that  when united will determine the outline. Small, handheld slabs can be poised verti- cally, nearly parallel to, rather than perpendicular to, the line of  sight, and kept in  this position while they are decorated with a depiction that seems naturalistic from  that perspective. When such decorations are viewed normally, they will prove to be  anamorphoses. Renaissance anamorphoses often distort the subject so as to render it com- pletely unrecognizable from any viewpoint other than the correct one, while figures  anamorphosed by Paleolithic peoples are always recognizable, though distorted.  Nonetheless, the principle of  anamorphosis, as a perspective distortion that can be  normalized by the perceptual apparatus under specifiable conditions, remains the  same, whether we are concerned with Paleolithic or Renaissance examples. Pfeiffer’s summary mention of  anamorphosis as an odd diversion in Paleolithic  art misses the point. It is more than an exotic kind of  visual punning. It is an in- genious technique of  figure enhancement, for a properly constructed and viewed  anamorphosis seems to float free in space, at right angles to the decorated surface.  Since proper viewing places the spectator in a specific position, anamorphosis is  also direct evidence about the direction from which a figure was intended to be  approached, and in combination with other clues provided by fixed depictions and  their surroundings, may permit the reconstruction of  the Paleolithic “itinerary” for  viewing a series of  figures. Once direction of  approach is determined, the order of   viewing of  a sequence of  figures may also be established. Last, because the figure  is viewed at an acute angle, it is always presented to one side of  the visual mid- line. This fact may tell us much about lateralization of  function in the two cerebral  hemispheres of  Paleolithic artists and their audiences, about the kinds of  “mean- ing” the figures were intended to convey, and about the ways in which the informa- tion they contained was processed in the cerebral cortex (Springer and Deutsch  1981: 30, 64). Anamorphosis is potentially one of  the most informative techniques  in Paleolithic art. Positioning A figure may gain in impact by being displayed in a position that dominates the  spectator’s viewpoint. Depictions on cave ceilings, such as the polychrome figures at  Altamira, may overwhelm the spectator by their relatively large size, as mentioned  above, but this effect is exaggerated by the fact that they are executed on the ceiling  and force the viewer to take an awkward position, concentrating his attention on  the polychromes and excluding other stimuli from the surroundings. Sometimes the  viewer is “anchored” in a particular spot to view a depiction. In the so-called throne  room at La Pasiega, a natural rock formation, polished by use, forms a seat. When  used, this almost automatically directs the spectator’s gaze to a large painted bison.  technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art 303 </page> <page sequence="10"> 304 technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art Viewing the animal figures in the cupola, or the tectiforms in the narrow fissure end- ing Gallery A at Pasiega (Leroi-Gourhan 1964: fig. 134), similarly fixes the spectator’s  viewpoint. framing Some figures, even some groups of  depictions, are enhanced by enclosure within a  natural frame. They are thus separated from other figures and, when illuminated  properly, stand out from their surroundings with striking clarity. Perhaps the best  known example of  this technique in Spain is to be seen in the “Camarín” in the Peña  de Candamo. The Camarín is a cavity with an ashy bluish background bordered by  stalactitic formations. Several figures populate the cavity, but most impressive is a  horse, in sienna, that contrasts markedly in color with the background. When the  Camarín is illuminated from inside, its figures suddenly, magically appear “outside”  the dark cave environment as though one were looking out to a sunlit exterior, and  the horse almost seems to come alive (Hernández-Pacheco 1919: 51, 52, plate 10;  Gómez Tabanera 1975). The effect must be seen to be believed. discovery The sudden discovery of  a depiction which is hidden by obstacles from all but one  particular point of  view can greatly augment the impact the figure causes. The final  corridor in Altamira is so narrow, tortuous, and low that the visitor must shuffle  along, often bent nearly double, continually glancing from the ceiling and walls of   the gallery to its floor to avoid blundering into a projecting rock, slipping, or stum- bling. At one point he must pick his way over and around several large fallen blocks,  as the tunnel veers left. Suddenly, within inches of  his face, a grotesque mask, half- animal, half-human (Leroi-Gourhan 1964: plate 403), pops into view at eye level on  the left. The experience even startles those who are intimately familiar with the gal- lery, if  they come upon the mask while distracted. To the neophyte, it can be nearly  heart-stopping. The trick is obviously intentional—it is repeated in similar fashion  several times in the final gallery. counterpoise (counterposition) Any of  the techniques listed earlier could serve perfectly well as a means of  adding  impact to a single isolated figure. Counterpoise and all the techniques that follow  require multiple figures or a combination of  a figure and a scenic ground for their  execution. In counterposed depictions, similar figures are opposed to one another in a bal- anced composition. The similarity displayed may be one of  color, size, “style,” or  kind of  animal represented. This technique is treated somewhat differently by Leroi- Gourhan (1982) in his discussions of  “symmetry” and “partial overlapping.” The  red-brown cattle on opposite sides of  the axial gallery at Lascaux (Bataille 1955: 76)  </page> <page sequence="11"> are a fine example of  counterposed figures, one of  which is further counterposed,  head to head, to another red bovine on its own side of  the gallery. In the main hall at  the same site, the opposition of  two large black and white bulls on the “left” wall and  the two bison shown tail to tail in the nave are similar cases (Bataille 1955: 46, 50–52,  105), as is the pair of  polka-dot horses on the large panel at Pech-Merle (Lemozi  1929; Breuil 1974 [1952]: 270–71). At Le Portel, a pair of  bison confront each other in  such a counterposed composition (Breuil 1974 [1952]: fig. 216). The number of  other  similar cases is too numerous for detailed discussion of  this point. The spatial symmetry of  a counterposed composition need not, of  course,  be absolutely perfect, nor do the animals or signs depicted need to be absolutely  identical. complementarity This technique is similar in some respects to that of  counterpoise, except that here,  instead of  having a spatially symmetrical repetition of  figures, an element of  dis- similarity is injected. Moreover, the spatial arrangement of  complementary figures  need not be symmetrical at all; the figures need only be close enough to one another  to be grasped by the viewer as related, though their complementarity need not be  immediately perceived. In some cases, complementary figures are united by a rela- tively evident theme—that is to say, a theme that would have been recognized by  prehistoric hunters familiar with the behavior and stereotyped attitudes of  the wild  animals they pursued. Though rare, there are some Paleolithic depictions of  sexual  complementarity—males and females are occasionally shown together, in stereo- typed courtship postures. One convincing example is the pair of  bison from the final  gallery at Altamira, mistakenly identified by Breuil as a paired mammoth and bison  (Breuil and Obermaier 1935: 85; Freeman 1978: fig. 4). Denise de Sonneville–Bordes  reports an example in the frieze of  horses from la Chaire-à-Calvin (1963: 187–90,  plate 9). Several decorated bone and stone objects from La Madeleine and one from  Abri Morin depict paired animals or heads, sometimes different enough in size to  suggest sexual dimorphism (Capitan and Peyrony 1928: figs. 20, 38, 54, plate 15; de  Sonneville–Bordes 1975: figs. 27 and 28). In the Morin case, a bison family of  male/ female and calf  seems to be depicted. Annette Laming-Emperaire (1962) and André Leroi-Gourhan (1964, 1965, 1982)  are to be credited for having called attention to another kind of  complementarity in  Paleolithic art. This is the statistically detectable relationship between different ani- mal species and between specific animals and specific “signs,” more particularly the  complementary opposition of  horses on the one hand and wild cattle or bison on the  other. Leroi-Gourhan notes that this opposition may be underlined by the relative  size and number of  depictions of  the kinds of  animals involved, the dominant type  of  creature in a panel being stressed by the average size or abundance of  its repre- sentations (1982: 60). Other kinds of  animals are often shown in marginal positions  near groups of  these fundamental species and still others are often hidden away near  the ends of  assemblages or in nearly inaccessible interior corridors, in even more  technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art 305 </page> <page sequence="12"> 306 technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art peripheral situations. Such observations as these have made Leroi-Gourhan’s work  the central stimulus to the study of  spatial and numerical relationships of  Paleolithic  parietal figures in recent years (this chapter is, of  course, just one more in the series  of  offshoots from that trunk). Leroi-Gourhan’s thesis, and the documentation pro- vided by his sketch-maps and the superb photography of  Jean Vertut, are too well- known to need further discussion here. repetition There are a number of  cases in Paleolithic art of  the repeated depiction of  figures  of  the same “kind” (whether animals, anthromorphs, or geometrics) in close pro- pinquity on a single panel. The fact that the polychrome figures on the ceiling of   the Great Hall at Altamira are broadly similar in style and technique of  rendition  (though certainly executed by several artists) as well as size (between one and a  half  and two meters in maximum diameter), position, and orientation (the reclin- ing figures all with heads in the same direction, backs more or less perpendicular  to the backs of  the standing bison nearest them, the ground line for the standing  figures more or less in the same general direction, rather than random, and never  completely opposed), and the lack of  overlap or superimposition of  adjacent fig- ures are the strongest possible arguments that the Paleolithic artists intended them  to represent a single integrated composition whose impact would be reinforced by  sheer repetition. I have argued that at least two of  the so-called wild boars in this  group are mistaken identifications of  other bison (Freeman 1978: 168–71), and that  opinion has been accepted by others including Moure (1981) and Apellániz (1982:  55). The reclassification of  these figures makes repetition even more important to  the composition, of  course. In this case, repetition is an incentive to the viewer to search further for a uni- fying meaning of  the figures. The makeup of  the group of  bison, incorporating as  it does both adult males and females, indicates that the artist intended to depict a  herd of  bison at the season of  the rut (Freeman 1978). This meaning has been over- looked by scholars who have treated the animals as so many unrelated individual  depictions. Some examples of  repetition in Paleolithic art are even more obvious. The  line of  little horses on the right wall of  Lascaux’s axial gallery or the five stags’  heads along the right wall of  the nave, postures suggesting they are swimming in  a stream indicated by a linear discolored patch on the wall into which their necks  merge (Bataille 1955: 69, 95); the sculpted friezes of  horses at la Chaire-à-Calvin (de  Sonneville–Bordes 1963) and Cap-Blanc (Roussot 1965, 1972); the painted friezes of   mammoth and rhinoceros in the Breuil Gallery at Rouffignac (Nougier and Robert  1959; Leroi-Gourhan 1965: figs. 535 and 536); that of  bison at Font-de-Gaume (Breuil  1974 [1952]: fig. 39; Leroi-Gourhan 1965: fig. 527); and the economically depicted  herds of  reindeer and horses on small bone objects from Chaffaud and the Grotte  de la Mairie at Teyjat (Barandiarán 1972: 345) sufficiently illustrate the popularity of   repetition as a figure-enhancement device. </page> <page sequence="13"> Such scenes are so widespread and so clearly compositional that one wonders  how so many authorities before Leroi-Gourhan could have glibly and totally denied  the existence of  true compositions in Paleolithic art (Hoernes and Behn 1928: 44;  Pittioni 1949: 60; Clark 1961: 56; Clark and Piggot 1965: 92; Hawkes 1963: 197). Outlines of  human hands are also frequently massed together, as, for example,  at Castillo (Alcalde del Río, Breuil, and Sierra 1912: plate 65). At Pindal, sticklike fig- ures, some ending in hand shapes, are arranged in two groups, one above the other  (Alcalde del Río, Breuil, and Sierra 1912: plates 24 and 27). The occurrence of  other  kinds of  geometric signs in masses of  repeated shapes, as in the gallery of  discs at  Castillo, the dots at Trois Frères, the group of  teardrop shapes before a fish at Pindal,  the series of  six claviforms beneath a bison at the same site, or the repeated tecti- forms at Pasiega and Castillo, is more the rule than the exception (Breuil 1974 [1952]:  fig. 124; Alcalde del Río, Breuil, and Sierra 1912: plates 39, 43, 69, 77, and 78). In some cases, figures are repeated over such a large area that the grouping can- not be viewed as a whole from any single place; such series more properly exemplify  the next technique. Progression Progression also involves the repetition of  similar depictions, but ordinarily the re- peated figures are separated from one another by some distance, so that instead of   being grasped nearly at once, the series of  similar figures is revealed by degrees.  Recognition of  the similarity of  separated figures sharpens the viewer’s attention,  arouses the anticipation of  other related depictions, stimulates a more active scan- ning of  the visual environment, and creates suspense. It is the same device used in so  many horror films, to such effect. The masks in the final gallery at Altamira are a superb example of  the success- ful application of  the technique; the discovery of  six previously unreported masks in  1981 brings the total of  these figures to nine. The first examples encountered after  entering the gallery are a pair of  masks that confront each other across the narrow  corridor. However, the left-hand mask is hidden from the entering visitor’s view.  After negotiating a hairpin bend and some meters of  undecorated corridor, another  mask springs into view on the visitor’s right. A few meters further on, another hy- brid visage peers out on our left. Then one comes to a widening in the corridor,  where two masks are visible on the left (though, like the last, these are better seen  on the return). As the passageway narrows again, another mask is seen on the right.  On exiting through the wide chamber, the visitor sees two more masks that were  previously hidden and, just before leaving the corridor entirely, he finds the formerly  invisible member of  the opposed pair before him. The mysterious quality of  these  three-dimensional faces, half-animal but still eerily human, is sufficient by itself  to  awe the viewer. Combined with the technique of  discovery, the masks appear as startling and  monstrous apparitions. Suspense built by the use of  progression can make a visit to  this gallery a not-to-be-forgotten adventure. On leaving the constrained environment  technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art 307 </page> <page sequence="14"> 308 technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art of  the final gallery, one continues to fancy that still more visages lurk among the ir- regularities of  the cave in other areas (in fact, some probably do). In the preceding section I mentioned that some continuous (or discontinuous)  repetitions of  signs extend for very long distances, as at the gallery of  discs at Castillo  (Alcalde del Río, Breuil, and Sierra 1912: figs. 109 and 110, plate 69). Sometimes,  similar geometric forms are repeated where there are important projections (as at  Pindal), or at the entries of  narrow, or dangerous, or important passageways (Alcalde  del Río, Breuil, and Sierra 1912: 69). Such uses of  progression seem to me different  from the cases discussed earlier. One wonders whether these may not be “indexical”  signs, like danger signs or direction indicators along a highway. (That interpretation  has been suggested independently by other authorities.) Only a small amount of  ad- ditional research would be needed to establish or reject the suggestion for particular  caves on empirical grounds. “landscaping” (use of natural formations as scenic supports) Natural formations on cave walls and ceilings are frequently incorporated into com- positions as scenic devices. The case of  the San Román “Camarín” has already been  discussed. Probably the commonest device of  the type is the use of  a natural ledge,  crack, concavity, or discoloration to suggest a ground line, along which animal fig- ures walk. The technique is used at Font-de-Gaume, Lascaux, Rouffignac, and else- where (Leroi-Gourhan 1982: 27–28, plate 69). Sometimes the naturally suggested  ground line is tilted rather than horizontal, and the animals are tipped to follow the  slope—as, for example, at Las Monedas and Le Portel (Ripoll 1980; Leroi-Gourhan  1965: plates 64 and 66). More unusual and more striking is the use of  the edges of  voids produced by  cracks, hollows, and corners to suggest cliffs over which animals fall, or pits into  which they tumble. A bison at Monedas slips into a crack (Ripoll 1980: plate 10). At  Lascaux, a horse at the far end of  the axial gallery seems to fall hindquarters first into  a concavity suggesting a cliff  edge (Bataille 1955: 81, 89), and in this case the part of   the figure that disappears over the edge was never completed. The technique adds  considerable tension and movement to compositions. Sometimes, a negative, empty space is inventively used to suggest a positive ob- struction from behind which a figure emerges. At Las Chimeneas, this is suggested  by a horse’s head that appears as though from behind a shadowy rock (González  Echegaray 1974: plate 22). There is a very similar interplay of  isolated horse’s head  and void at Rouffignac (Nougier 1966: plate 15). Concavities and voids formed by irregular limestone surfaces also seem to have  been an inordinately frequent stimulus to cave occupants to execute other kinds of   manipulative activities. At Niaux and Chufín, cavities have been outlined with red  coloring material (Leroi-Gourhan 1982: plate 112; Almagro 1973). In the final gal- lery at Altamira, some fissures have been packed with gobs of  clay, and more clay  smeared around them. This enigmatic behavior would suggest rather obvious inter- pretations to a psychoanalyst of  the Freudian school. Though they would probably  </page> <page sequence="15"> recoil from being called Freudians, many prehistorians agree that a sexual interpreta- tion is appropriate for these phenomena. The behavior responsible is not related to  the “scenic” use of  voids. embedment Suitable limestone surfaces in caves have sometimes served as the canvas for gen- erations of  artists. Decorated panels may be palimpsests of  layer upon layer of  su- perimposed figures. Prehistorians often assume that much time must have elapsed  between successive superimpositions. But that need not be the case. In portable art  objects, we know of  the existence of  engraved cobbles, stone slabs, or bones with  many intricately superimposed figures, that most would agree were probably pro- duced over a short period of  time: cobbles from Colombière, slabs from La Marche  and Parpalló, scapulae from Castillo, to cite just a few examples (Leroi-Gourhan  1965: plates 480–85; Pales and Tassin de Saint-Péreuse 1976; Almagro 1976). In these  cases, to see a particular figure the viewer must often work through an elaborate  visual puzzle of  crossing, interpenetrating lines and unrelated depictions in which  the figure is concealed and embedded. The modern human brain seems to be stimulated positively by such exercises:  the search for and eventual recognition of  isolated depictions is rewarding in itself;  the perceptual game is self-motivating. There is no reason to believe that such ac- tivity was beyond the mental capacity of  the skeletally modern Upper Paleolithic  populations who are our near ancestors or close relatives. To the contrary, Upper  Paleolithic palimpsests would seem to show that those populations enjoyed the per- ceptual exercise as we do. The cave walls contain wonderful examples of  apparently chaotic masses of  in- terwoven lines that conceal individual figures of  animals, humans, and hybrids. The  viewer may stand for hours, enthralled by some of  the more labyrinthine entangle- ments, working to disengage individual figures from the background of  overlain web- work that hides them. There are fascinating panels of  this sort at Trois Frères, Gargas,  Pech-Merle, and Lascaux (Breuil 1974 [1952]: 160–77, 254–57, 273; Vialou 1979). Such  exuberant panels are quite common. Enigmatic panels like that at Las Monedas,  containing no recognizable depictions, nevertheless stimulate the viewer to project  imagined forms into the disordered array (Ripoll 1980: plate 25). While it is generally  supposed that such palimpsests as those from Trois Frères resulted from the repeated  redecoration of  a single panel at widely separated intervals in time, there is absolute- ly no proof  of  the assumption, and no inherent reason why the delineations could  not have been produced over a very short time instead, pace Marshack. Whatever the  history of  their accumulation, their effect on the viewer is in any case the same.  dIscussIon I have identified and discussed a list of  17 special conventions in this chapter. I have  no doubt that aspects of  my list are not completely satisfactory, nor do I doubt that  technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art 309 </page> <page sequence="16"> 310 technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art many other conventions like these may exist. I hope that the study will provoke fur- ther discussion and investigation of  these techniques, and will stimulate the refine- ment of  the list or its entire substitution by other, more appropriate, formulations. Ucko and Rosenfeld’s thorough, scholarly treatment of  cave art (1967) largely  demolished facile and simplistic notions about its motivations, and dampened the  ardor of  armchair theorists for universalistic explanations for its production. At the  same time, though I am sure this was as unintended as it is unfortunate, their work  seems to have slowed the search for empirical information about more concrete  and particularistic meanings and motives of  specific artistic assemblages. There is  nothing in their book that compels such reluctance, and in fact Ucko himself  did  not abandon the quest. True, we may never thoroughly understand any artistic  assemblage or why it was produced, but the careful and objective search for such  understanding is incumbent on any prehistorian who deals with Paleolithic art. To  conduct a responsible search for particular motives and meanings, we must exam- ine the depictions and their settings and relationships more thoroughly than ever.  That requires a more complete and rigorous analysis of  themes depicted, materi- als utilized, techniques of  execution, artistic conventions, and styles than has been  produced heretofore. The special conventions just discussed single themselves out for our particular  attention. Where they occur we cannot help but be struck by the fact that the figures  involved have somehow been elevated above the common level of  the mass, as un- derlined or italicized words stand out from a text. The special stress placed on these  figures may indicate that they bear a central part of  the meaning of  the panel or as- semblage, that they recapitulate it or condense it. Of  course, they may prove to have  no such focal importance, but it would be irresponsible not to consider that possibil- ity at all. The soon-to-be-published results of  new research at Altamira suggest that  there, at least, the techniques of  isolation, size contrast, attitude, omission, shadow  completion, caprice, anamorphosis, positioning, framing, discovery, counterpoise,  repetition, complementarity, and progression are all used (often in combination) to  enhance figures with special relevance to a set of  interrelated themes that pervade  the cave, that may now be recognized as central aspects of  “meaning” of  the art at  Altamira. Since the conventions for figure enhancement are so many and varied, it  may be suspected that the conventions themselves may have differed in their mean- ing to the artists and their contemporaries, and that the choice of  one set instead of   another equally practicable set is a significant datum. There is no doubt that specific conventions convey particular kinds of  informa- tion to the modern analyst. The study of  unusual attitudes has already suggested  that depictions in certain sites have seasonal significance, and reflect an interest in  the reproductive condition of  selected species (Freeman 1978). The techniques of   omission and shadow completion and the use of  natural formations as scenic sup- port show the extent to which Upper Paleolithic people’s mental processes, like our  own, tended to supply the missing parts of  familiar percepts, simplifying and reshap- ing complex or irregular forms to construct recognizable figures. In both anamor- phism and discovery, the figure is first presented or presented in most recognizable  </page> <page sequence="17"> form to a particular portion of  the visual field. Examples of  such figures designed  to be presented to the left side of  the visual midline seem to me to be more com- mon than others presented to the right of  the midline, though I have still made  no attempt outside Altamira at the systematic collection of  empirical data needed  to verify this impression. Among living peoples, where information is presented di- rectly to the cerebral hemisphere best specialized to process it, response is quicker  and more accurate than otherwise. Holistic recognition of  complex visual stimuli  is accomplished most rapidly and efficiently when the data are presented on the  left of  the visual midline, directly to the right hemisphere. Where a startling effect  was desired, grotesque hidden figures popped into sight on the viewer’s left, so that  the complex visual data they presented would be channeled directly to the right  hemisphere for immediate holistic processing. On the other hand, presentation from  the viewer’s right to the left hemisphere should facilitate logical consideration of   symbolic content. If  the stimuli of  the depictions in particular caves were predomi- nantly designed to fall on one side or the other of  the visual midline, it would tend  to suggest that cerebral hemisphere function among Upper Paleolithic artists and  their audiences was differentiated as it is among living peoples. (Even placement  that simply reflects handedness would bear on the subject.) Sets of  symbols and  whole sites could be compared and contrasted on this axis. The potential behavioral  information provided by such data is absolutely fundamental to any reconstruction  of  the evolution of  mental processes. Art is almost alone as a domain where durable  products of  prehistoric human behavior have immediate and unequivocal relevance  to studies of  psychological development. Attitude, anamorphism, discovery, complementarity, and progression are among  the techniques whose study can lead to the recognition of  sequences of  figures that  can only be properly viewed in a particular order. In rare favorable cases, such as  the narrow gallery at Altamira, it may even be possible to reconstruct the itinerary  Paleolithic visitors must have followed to traverse a gallery while viewing its deco- rations. When a long viewing sequence is established, the order of  the figures may  provide other clues to the meaning of  the series as a whole. Certainly the series in  its interrelated entirety offers more information to the analyst than the individual  figure considered alone. Other aspects of  the use of  enhancement techniques deserve further study. The  details of  the application of  particular techniques to particular kinds of  figures need  to be thoroughly analyzed. For example, while bird/human hybrids are apparently  common, I know of  no bird/mammal hybrids in Paleolithic art, a fact also remarked  by S. Giedion (1981: 61). Relationships between species, their complementarity, op- position, or equivalence, all factors fundamental to the theories of  Leroi-Gourhan  and others, might be manifest in the merging of  particular animals in hybrid forms.  Further study might also show that particular techniques of  figure enhancement  were only applied to specific kinds of  figures—one or a few animal species or some  set of  geometrics—rather than to all indiscriminately. Relationships between sites or  galleries within a site might be indicated by similarity in enhancement techniques and  their application. Sites, periods, panels, or galleries might be classified and compared  technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art 311 </page> <page sequence="18"> 312 technIques of fIgure enhancement In PaleolIthIc cave art on the basis of  the categories of  figure-enhancement devices represented, their ap- plications, and frequencies. One final illustrative example of  the utility of  this approach may be given. At  Altamira, engravings in the final gallery can be seen to be related to the polychromes  on the Great Ceiling, with respect to species represented and the ways in which size  contrast, omission, positioning, counterpoise, repetition, and complementarity are  employed. But, enhancement techniques are not used in the same ways in the two  galleries. In fact, size, counterpoise, frequencies of  repeated figures, complementar- ity, positioning, and omission are applied to the final gallery in ways just the opposite  or inverse of  their application on the Great Ceiling. Here, relatedness seems to be  indicated by complementary opposition rather than identity. Enough has been said to indicate the potential of  the study of  this material.  Perhaps it is not the most fundamental substance we might examine. It may prove  to be the case that more basic aspects of  meaning, at least at the iconic level, are  borne by the choice of  animals or forms represented. But, the enhancement tech- niques described undeniably serve to stress and structure that meaning. The study of   structure and stress can clarify systems of  meaning in ways that the study of  single  meaning-bearing elements cannot. Meaning in Paleolithic depictions probably always exists at several levels, of   which some (the levels of  more arbitrary meaning) may be completely closed to,  and others very difficult of  access to, the modern analyst. I suspect that for the most  symbolic levels of  meaning, we are constrained to recover only evanescent glimpses  of  the information encoded in Paleolithic art. However, it seems clear that if  any  reception or decipherment is ever to be possible, all relevant aspects of  the informa- tion-bearing attributes of  the data must be taken into account. Enhancement tech- niques are surely an important and neglected part of  the message, and one that  merits much closer and more critical study.  references Abramova, Z. A. 1966.
