<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Deposition of Bishop Wiim Montgomery Brown in NVew Orleans, 1925 By JOHN L. KYSER A recipient of the M.A. degree in history from Louisiana State University, Mr. Kyser is now studying for Holy Orders at the School of Theology, University of the South, Sewanee, Tenn.-from the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana. In the 1920's the Christian world experienced a great deal of religious ferment and dissension, especially over Biblical interpretation and Modernism. Along with other religious bodies, the Episcopal Church was caught up in this turmoil. Its internal peace had been seriously disturbed from 1910 to 1930 by such clerics as R. Herber Newton, Algernon S. Crapsey, Percy S. Grant, and Lee Heaton. Yet none of these men was as bizarre or as interesting as William Montgomery Brown, one-time Bishop of Arkansas, known as the "atheist bishop." After two heresy trials and an appeal before the House of Bishops in New Orleans, Brown was deposed from his episcopal office in 1925. This man, aside from being perhaps the most advanced Modernist of note in the Episcopal Church, was also a member of the Communist Party.1 Bishop Brown, despite his interesting career, has never re- 'See Raymond Albright, A History of the Protestant Episcopal Church (New York, 1964); W.

This neglect seems even more surprising today when Christianity is torn with controversy over such basic doctrines as the Trinity and the Virgin Birth, problems which Brown anticipated in his writings some time ago. Even more than some of his rather outspoken contempo- raries and later clerical rebels, Brown forthrightly expressed his views and courageously held to them, even upon threat of deposition. He was the only American bishop ever to be de- posed for heresy while a member of a religious community claiming to be part of the Apostolic Catholic tradition. Brown was born in Orville, Ohio, September 4, 1855. Shortly after his birth, both of his parents died. Having no close relatives, he was shuttled around from foster parent to foster parent and from school to school until he was in- troduced to the wealthy Cleveland philanthropist, Mary S. Bradford. She provided funds for his education and also in- fluenced him toward the priesthood of the Episcopal Church. Later Brown married the young adopted daughter of Mary Bradford, a marriage which brought him wealth and social con- tact. He attended Kenyon College and Bexley Hall Seminary, and after graduating from seminary, he was made a deacon. In 1884 Brown was ordained to the priesthood. He served as rector at Galion, Ohio, from 1884 to 1891, and from 1891 to 1897 as Archdeacon for the Diocese of Ohio.2 In 1897 Brown was elected Bishop of Arkansas in an elec- tion marked by opposition and charges of fraud. The chancel- lor of the Diocese of Arkansas, W. G. Whipple, led a group of unhappy laymen in an attempt to block the election; little came of it, but a lingering bitterness resulted.3 Brown's epis- copate in Arkansas, from 1898 to 1912, was certainly any- thing but uneventful. He established a separate Negro convo- cation in Arkansas which drew much criticism. Later Brown attempted to close the Cathedral at Little Rock on the grounds 2Galion (Ohio) Inquirer, November 1, 1937; Ralph L. Roy, Communism and the Churches (New York, 1960), 21. 3W. G.

Because of the wording of the Cathedral charter, Brown could not close the Cathedral or turn it into a parish church. The charter had stipulated that any attempt to alter the status of the Cathedral would deny the church's possession of the property and building.5 Because of increasingly poor health, Bishop Brown resigned from his see in 1912 and retired to Galion, Ohio, where he remained close to his home and spent his time reading and meditating. In the course of his readings. he came across a letter dealing with the causes of World War I which had just started in Europe. The letter aroused his interest, and he began writing to the author, a woman, about his views on the war. During their correspondence, she advised him to write to the Socialist Party for more information on war, greed, and capitalism, subjects which their letters had dis- cussed. He did so and soon was flooded with a mountain of Socialist literature which he eagerly digested.6 During the war years, Brown's religious views changed quite drastically. He read the works of Marx and Darwin avidly, and in the course of doing so, rejected "supernatural- ism" and "anthropomorphism," as he later admitted in a letter written to Bishop Thomas J. Garland of Pennsylvania. The support that the Episcopal bishops gave to the Anglo- American war effort also affected him adversely and helped to draw him closer to the philosophy of Marx.7 Shortly after the close of World War I, Bishop Brown began to gather his thoughts and reflections and put them down on paper. The result was a little book, perhaps one of 4William Rostell Witsell, Christ Church, 1837-1947 (n.p., n.d.), 72-74; Eliza- beth Pierce Lyman, History of Trinity Cathedral (n.p., n.d.), 12-14 (copies in the libraries of the Church Historical Society, Austin, and the School of Theol- ogy, University of the South, Sewanee, Tennessee). 5Lyman, History of Trinity Cathedral, 12-14. 6Roy, Communism and the Churches, 21. 7William Montgomery Brown to Thomas J.

Unable to find any publisher in the United States willing to accept his manuscript, he set up his own press for the publication of the book in Galion, Ohio, in 1920. In this most astonishing and curious volume, Brown began with the phrase, "Banish the Gods from the skies and Capitalists from the earth and make the world safe for Industrial Commu- nism." The purpose of the book was, he said, to advocate Marxism, the removal of the "blight" of theism and capitalism, and freedom for the truth.8 Brown saw humanity as the new divinity; the old concept of God was to him nothing more than a symbol of humanity and all of its goodness. "Jesus," wrote Brown, "was nothing if not a revolutionist"; but in spite of His many heresies, He remained a Jew until He was killed by them. This ex- ample, provided by Christ, justified in Brown's mind his stay- ing with the Episcopal Church, even though he disagreed with its doctrines. "Communism is for me," he said, "the one comprehensive term which is a synonym at once for morality, religion, and Christianity. .. .." 9In other words he saw Com- munism as a modernistic Christianity. Brown also felt that "Christianism" (his term for organized Christianity) as a system had collapsed because it had failed to bring peace; likewise, Americanism as a system had failed because of the solidification of social classes. Capitalism and "Christianism" are similar forms of parasitism, he said, but the world worships gold, the symbol of the god of capi- talism, more faithfully than it does the unreal god of "Chris- tianism." (He declared that "cannibalism is the chief basis of our sacrament of the Holy Communion of bread and wine.") Brown concluded that Marxian Socialism was the world's most perfect gospel, even better than the gospel of Jesus.'0 8William Montgomery Brown, Communism and Christianism Analyzed and Contrasted From the Marxian and Darwinian Points of View (Galion, 1920), 3, 215-16. 91bid., 22-27. 10ibid., 17, 22, 52-53, 76.</page><page sequence="5">DEPOSITION OF BISHOP BROWN, 1925 39 This curious blend of science, Marxism, and religion, coupled with a thin veneer of Christian folklore from which Brown seemed unable to divorce himself, did not at first attract the attention he expected. He sadly wrote that he felt lonely and that many of his old friends avoided him as a freak. He once reflected that in his orthodox days as an Episcopal bishop he always commanded respect, but now, as a man truly using his intellect, he was shunned.1" But soon attention was to come his way. The Russsian Communists began to use his book against the Russian Ortho- dox Church, and by 1922 the embarrassed American episcopate took serious note of him. Meanwhile the short-lived, Com- munist-inspired "Living Church Movement" within Russian Orthodoxy offered Brown the position of bishop, but his health would not allow him to make the trip. He became an American Communist, however, contributing over twelve dollars a month to the party.'2 The Worker enthusiastically remarked: Bishop Brown wrote a little book entitled "Communism and Christianism"; which left the Church as full of holes as a Swiss Cheese and as smelly as Limberger.... It was a regular god-killer. What the bishop left of God intact even a self respecting atheist could accept without losing his dignity.'3 While the Communists had mixed feelings about him, especially when he appeared at their meetings in his episcopal robes, the undaunted Brown continued to spread interest in his book. For example, he sent a copy of the book with a letter to the Ohio Socialist, Sinclair Hertell, stating that eco- nomic evil was the one problem that filled the earth with slaves and masters and the skies with devils and gods; this problem he said, could only be solved by revolution.' The Living Church, a popular Episcopalian newsmagazine, declared in 1923 that the Communists were using Brown's "Roy, Communism and the Churches, 22-23. l2Ibid., 24-25. l3The Worker, January 17, 1925. 14Brown to Sinclair Hertell, April 30, 1921, Brown Papers.</page><page sequence="6">40 LOUISIANA HISTORY book to tear down the Christian religion. One Communist was quoted by the Living Church as having said that "atheism might be taught in the pulpits of the Russian 'Living Church' in the same way it is in some American Cathedrals." This magazine concluded its article by expressing a hope that the House of Bishops would take action.'5 Brown's writings now began to capture his church's at- tention. As early as 1922 the Diocese of Arkansas requested that the General Convention try Brown for denying the divinity of Christ and for deriding the Holy Eucharist. This action must have jarred Bishop Brown somewhat because he wrote to the House of Bishops challenging them to have him mentally examined. In this letter he also set forth the condi- tions upon which he would retire, or be tried. He said he would meet with an official Episcopal delegation. He asked that his book, Communism and Christianism, be read, debated, and discussed at a public meeting. If a committee of judges, chosen by him and by the House of Bishops, could agree after the debate that no real conflict existed between ortho- doxy and science, and if he could be convinced, he would retire and cause no more trouble.'6 Shortly Brown heard that the motion for his trial offered by the Diocese of Arkansas had failed because many at the General Convention considered him mentally deranged. He reacted by refusing to meet with a group sent by the House of Bishops to see him, and declared in a reply to the Bishops that he would not resign his episcopate for there were other heretics in the Episcopal Church who had also rejected ortho- doxy." Bishop Thomas F. Gailor of Tennessee called Brown's book, "Heresy easy to crush," but Brown merely replied that few bishops really held to the myths in the Bible or the Book of Common Prayer. The Catholic World had a different view 15"Building Up and Tearing Down," Living Church, LXVII (April 28, 1923), 904. 16Philadelphia Public Ledger, September 14, 1922; Brown, "To the House of Bishops of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America," September 25, 1922, Brown Papers; New York Times, July 15, 1923. 17Ibid.; Galion Inquirer, October 16, 1922.</page><page sequence="7">DEPOSITION OF BISHOP BROWN, 1925 41 from that of Bishop Gailor, feeling that the Episcopal bishops could hardly do anything about Brown, when other clerics in that body, like Dr. Percy S. Grant, had denied the divinity of Christ and stayed in the church."8 But charges of heresy were drawn up against Brown by Bishops A. C. Hall of Vermont, J. M. Francis of Indianap- olis, and W. L. Gravatt of West Virginia. He was sum- moned from his home in Galion, Ohio, to face trial "for holding and teaching publicly and privately and advisedly, doctrine contrary to that held by the Episcopal Church." 19 Brown declared that even if he were tried, it would not affect his status as a bishop or a churchman because of the indelible nature of Baptism and Holy Orders. Dr. William N. Gutherie commented that Brown had no real sympathy from Modernists; although in his younger days Brown had been a pioneer in the fight for freedom of expression in the Church, Guthrie felt he had now become warped with age. The Churchman, a liberal Episcopalian paper, editorialized that Brown was doing no harm and that the call for a trial was a black plot of conservatives against liberals.20 The trial finally commenced in Cleveland's Trinity Cathe- dral in late May of 1924. For the duration of this two-day trial, Brown's books were hawked to the curious public outside the Cathedral. Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, the famed liberal Jewish cleric; a delegation of Communists; Algernon S. Crapsey, the self-styled "last of the heretics," convicted in 1906; and several hundred curious spectators arrived to view the proceedings. Brown arrived with his attorneys to plead his case before the judges, seven Episcopal bishops. He attempted to catechize his judges and asked that the court state Anglican Doctrine so he could test it on those present to determine degrees of heresy. During this two-day session it seemed that Brown and his lawyers did most of the ques- 18New York Times, July 15, 1923; "The Atheist Bishop Again," Catholic World, CXVIII (January, 1924), 548. 19New York Times, April 6, 1924. 2OIbid., February 14, 1924; "Bishop Brown's Case," Churchman (February 23, 1924), 8.</page><page sequence="8">42 LOUISIANA HISTORY tioning and cross-examining. When Brown was put on the witness stand, he discussed his background and his acceptance of Marxism; as for his symbolic interpretation of the Bible, he asserted that all the other bishops were doing likewise. Finally the verdict came, and to no one's surprise, Brown was found guilty by the judges on twenty-three counts of heresy, based on his book, Communism and Christianism, which "proved that the defendant believed and taught, public- ly and privately, doctrine contrary to that held by the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of Amer- ica." 2 Although found guilty, with sentencing to come in the fall of 1924, Brown acted as if he had won, saying to the press that while he did not want to force his views on the Church, the trial had given the public an open view of the issues.22 There was varied reaction from the press. The Christian Century sympathized with Brown, called the trial the "rich- est of comedies," and said that Brown had the making of a saint. The Churchman, perhaps rightly, pointed out that the Church had been held up to ridicule while Brown improved himself in the eyes of the public. The Living Church de- clared that Brown's actions and beliefs had forced the Church to depose him.23 Flushed with what appeared successful publicity, Brown published a magazine, Heresy, recounting the trial, and his press also began to pour out a flood of books and pamphlets on heresy, Communism, and the Episcopal Church. The old heretic, Algernon S. Crapsey, came to Brown's aid with 2lPhiladelphia Public Ledger, May 27, 1924; Cleveland Plain Dealer, May 28-30, 1924; Philadelphia Evening Bulletin, May 31, 1924; New York Times, May 31-June 1, 1924; "A Bishop Convicted of Heresy," Literary Digest, LXXI (June 21, 1924), 31. 22New York Times, June 1, 1924. 23Charles W.

He charged that a church court had no power over the doctrines of a bishop and that the regular trial was unfair since he did not have an opportunity to challenge the judges. Brown kindly told the press that if at his next trial he was found guilty of heresy for interpreting Anglican Doctrine symbolically, he would point out that all other Episcopal bishops were guilty as well. He also mentioned that he would conclude his arguments by quoting that part of Alice In Wonderland in which the Queen of Hearts tells Alice to close her eyes so she can believe impossible things. One of Brown's lawyers wrote that the first trial was as one- sided as a Ku Klux Klan meeting and as impartial as the Court of Star Chamber.25 It also came out at this time that Bishop Brown had con- tributed money to a group of Communists who had been arrested in Bridgman, Michigan, for plotting to overthrow the United States Government. One of those caught in the raid, Joseph Pogany, a Hungarian Communist, had in his possession a check from Bishop Brown. As if this were not damaging enough, the Friends of the Soviet Union, a Com- munist-front group, sold Brown's Communism and Christian- 26 ism for funds to finance their activities. The Court of Review met in the unfinished Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. Brown was greatly impressed by its magnificence. At the trial he again outlined his career and his beliefs, denying the Virgin Birth but up- holding his belief in God, the "All in All," and the "Eter- nal Spirit." Yet he was again found guilty. He told the press it was shameful that the bishops would not allow him to 24See the issues of Heresy, March, 1924 to January, 1925. 25"Bishop Brown Quotes Alice in Brief," Christian Century, XLI (December 18, 1924), 1638; Joseph W.

"The Bishops," Brown said, "think they are sending me to hell." 27 According to canon law, Brown had one last appearance to make before the House of Bishops, meeting in New Or- leans in the fall of 1925. During the summer before that meet- ing, he participated in several events which would greatly hurt his cause. First, he appeared at Dr. William Norman Gutherie's church, St. Mark's-in-the-Bouwerie, which at that time was under Bishop William T. Manning's interdict for its unauthorized services and cultic rites. At this New York church Brown was greeted by a mob of curiosity seekers. Over 3,000 persons crowded the church, while many waited outside in the rain hoping to see him. Those fortunate enough to be inside heard one of the curates read portions of Brown's works, which were received enthusiastically. Meanwhile several panhandlers paced the aisles for handouts. Brown told the press that he wished to preach at St. John the Divine.28 From St. Mark's, Brown went to the Community Church of New York, then under the pastorage of John Haynes Holmes, a Unitarian minister who had been once de- prived of his pulpit for leftist leanings. Introduced as "His Grace, the Bishop of Arkansas," Brown, in his episcopal habit, delivered a sermon relating to the building drive then in prog- ress for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. The Living Church strongly objected to the whole event, declaring that despite two trials, Brown was still exercising his office.29 When Bishop Paul Jones, an advanced pacifist, appealed to the Episcopal laity to review the trial and to write their bishops to stop it, the Southern Churchman replied that the whole affair was closed. No one need worry about Brown's "ecstatic vaporings of theosophy"; his reciting the Creeds and then declaring them to be false sounded "like the rav- ings of insanity." 30 27Court for the Review of the Trial of A Bishop (n.p., n.d.), 4; "To Hell," Time, V (January 26, 1925), 20. 28Philadelphia North American, April 20, 1925. 29Roy, Communism and the Churches, 16; "Bishop Brown in New York," Living Church, LXXIII (May 2, 1925), 5. 30"Bishop Jones Asks For A Referendum," Southern Churchman, XC (July 18, 1925), 5-6.</page><page sequence="11">DEPOSITION OF BISHOP BROWN, 1925 45 During the summer of 1925, Brown was consecrated by Archbishop W. H. Francis into the so-called Old Catholic Church of North America, later known as the Western Orthodox Church. Archbishop Francis, alias Willie Brothers, had a rather spotty career. His church seems to have received its orders through one Bishop Vilatte, who claimed to have had both Old Catholic and Jacobite Orders, although both groups refused then, as now, to recognize him. The 1920 Anglican Lambeth Conference had declared invalid the orders of both Bishop Vilatte and another schismatic bishop in England, A. H. Matthew. In America only the Polish Na- tional Catholic Church has been considered a valid Old Catholic Church.3' The Living Church commented that since Brown was re-baptized and re-ordained in this church of Archbishop Francis, suspicion of the whole affair was justi- fied.32 In the same year Brown was made an honorary member in the Liberal Church, Inc., of Denver, Colorado. Bishop Frank Rice, the "primate" of this "church," said that Brown was also to be made a bishop in this organization, which was described by the Living Church as a "freak cult." Rice called himself the "Commissioner of God" and advertised a degree of "Scientific Common Sense," which he was prepared to offer because the requirements were revealed to him by the "God of the Universe." 3 Finally, General Convention time arrived and Episcopa- lians from all over the nation poured into New Orleans. Bishop Brown, his wife, and his advisor, Joseph Sharts (the nominee of the Socialist Party of Ohio for governor), ar- rived early in order to map plans to "save the Church." Archbishop Francis met the group at the railroad station, and naturally the press arrived on the scene.34 Bishop Brown told the waiting press reporters that his fellow bishops were: 31"Bishop Brown's Latest," Living Church LXXIII (October 10, 1925), 776; LXXX (April 21, 1928), 837; C.

Of course, I have no feeling against them. They have done nothing to me that I wouldn't have done twenty-five years ago, before I had my eyes opened, to anyone who expressed the same view I'm expressing today. Dear fellows all of them. I must drop around and see them all as soon as I have had a little rest from my jour- ney. Reiterating his theology and the charge that most Episcopa- lians were heretics, Brown said he hoped to preach in New Orleans. He indicated that he wanted another chance to ap- peal his trials as well as a concrete definition of heresy from the House of Bishops. Archbishop Francis commented that he had come as an observer since Brown was a bishop in his church. Furthermore, he had accepted Brown on the same creed which had been branded heresy by the Episcopal Church.35 Meanwhile Bishop Davis Sessums, refusing comment to the press on Brown's activities in New Orleans, barred him from the pulpits of the Episcopal Church in Louisiana. The Sunday before the General Convention was scheduled to open, Browvn went to the First Unitarian Church on Jef- ferson Avenue where the minister, the Reverend J. B. H. Tegarden, allowed him to preach. Later, in his book, My Heresy, Brown said that although he tried to pay a courtesy call on Bishop Sessums, the bishop asked him to forego the usual episcopal practice and then unfairly barred the pulpits of Louisiana Episcopal Churches to him; thus he was forced to preach in a Unitarian Church.36 When the General Convention opened, the Brown case was one of the first items of business on the agenda. The House of Bishops decided to permit Brown to speak, but it refused to allow him to have counsel during its meetings. While this decision apparently did not bother Brown, it did give some concern to his defense counsel.37 Hoping to aid 35New Orleans States, October 1, 1925. 36Ibid., October 4, 1925; William Montgomery Brown, My Heresy (New York, 1926), 217-18. 37New York Times, October 7, 1925.</page><page sequence="13">DEPOSITION OF BISHOP BROWN, 1925 47 his case, Brown had earlier written to the bishops that his consecration into the Old Catholic Church of Archbishop Francis had made him the only valid Episcopal bishop in America.38 (In 1897 the Pope had declared the Anglican Orders invalid because of intention; thus Rome recognized only the Old Catholic and Orthodox Order as valid. How- ever, these bodies during the 1920's turned around and recognized Anglican Orders as valid Catholic Orders.) Brown seemed to have forgotten the 1920 Lambeth Conference which invalidated the source of Archbishop Francis's Orders. This argument did not seem to impress the Episcopal prel- ates, because, when the first working day of the Convention arrived, the Bishop of Virginia announced that they would move to make the Brown case special business. The House of Bishops would push through the recommendations of the trial courts for deposition.39 The House of Bishops met on October 8, 1925, on St. Charles Avenue one block from St. Paul's Church (which has since moved), and heard the Bishop of Georgia, as head of the Committee on Dispatch, present a motion that the House of Bishops consider the Brown case. At this point Bishop Thomas F. Gailor offered a resolution asking for House ap- proval of the findings of the trial court, later affirmed by the Court of Review.40 Bishop Brown was then called in to speak. After speaking for some thirty minutes, he asked his fellow bishops for an ultimate court of appeal and more time in which to defend himself, as he realized he would not have time to read all of his 12,000 word statement to the House.4' The Bishop of Massachusetts, William Lawrence, himself an advanced Modernist, moved for a denial of Brown's re- 38Living Church, LXXIII (October 10, 1925), 776. 39New York Times, October 8, 1925. 40Journal of the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America Held in the City of New Orleans From October Seventh to October Twenty-fourth inclusive in the Year of Our Lord 1925 (New York, 1926), 35-36, hereinafter cited as Journal of the General Conven- tion. 41New York Times, October 9, 1925; "At New Orleans," Time, VI (Octo- ber 19, 1925), 36.</page><page sequence="14">48 LOUISIANA HISTORY quests, which was approved. By a vote of ninety-five to eleven, the House of Bishops decided to uphold the findings of the two heresy trial courts. The eleven dissenting bishops were reported to have favored a milder course. Bishop James Cheshire of North Carolina then attempted to introduce a resolution that would force the "heretical bishop" to leave his seat and remove his name from the roll of the House of Bishops, but this resolution was ruled out of order.42 The entire matter now passed to the Presiding Bishop, who could pass sentence and formally depose Brown. It was rumored at that time that if Brown went home, made no comment, refrained from using the title and office of bishop, and dropped his plans to sue the House of Bishops, the sentence and formal deposition might not be carried out. Brown had indicated that he might agree to such an arrange- ment. When the result of the vote was announced, some of the bishops broke into tears, while many ventured over to Brown to tell him that they bore him no ill will. Brown later told the press that the bishops were "lovely to him," that even Bishop Lawrence of Massachusetts, who was against him, wanted to give him a fair hearing.43 On the day following the vote, the Presiding Bishop, Ethel- bert Talbot, announced that the formal ceremony would be carried out. The ceremony was announced for October 12, 1925, at 9:30 A.M. in St. Paul's Episcopal Church, New Orleans. The swift action of the Presiding Bishop surprised many, including Brown, who announced that he was going to reverse his plans to drop the suit against the House of Bishops. Brown informed the press that he would ultimately win the fight because, in the long run, the attempts of the Church to answer him would be reversed. He said that the move by the Presiding Bishop had "upset my plans," as he had felt that the deposition would not be carried out. In answer to those bishops who were unhappy over the intention of the Presiding Bishop to carry out the sentence, Bishop Irving Johnson of Colorado declared that the handling of Bishop 42Journal of the General Convention, 36; New Orleans Item, October 9, 1925; New York Times, October 9, 1925. 43New Orleans Item, October 9, 1925; New York Times, October 9, 1925; New Orleans Times-Picayune, October 10, 1925.</page><page sequence="15">DEPOSITION OF BISHOP BROWN, 1925 49 Brown was fair, and, despite the fact that Brown had caused his church much embarrassment, had publicly denied God, and had violated his vows, the Church had been very cau- tious in trying him." Brown made good his threats to go to the Federal Dis- trict Court in New Orleans. He asked for a court order directing the Presiding Bishop and the House of Bishops to show cause why they should not be restrained from carrying out their intention to depose him. The court, how- ever, refused to stay the impositon of the sentence but decided to hold a hearing on the action at a later date. Bishop Brown then let it be known that he would not be present for the ceremony of deposition but would send a "victim." He told the press that he could not recognize this illegal action by by the House of Bishops, and he invited the bishops to join him at the New Orleans Labor Temple on the coming Sun- day. From church sources the public learned that Brown was not going to be excommunicated. Meantime, the Federal District Court took action at Brown's request by ordering the Presiding Bishop into court on October 15, 1925.45 On the Sunday preceding the act of deposition, Brown appeared in the church in which the ceremony would take place, surprising everyone, especially Bishop Blount of North Carolina, the celebrant of the Eucharist. Later that Sunday, Brown addressed a large crowd at the New Orleans Labor Temple, a union hall of various labor groups, on St. Charles Avenue near St. Paul's Church. He was introduced by Arch- bishop Francis. Repeating ideas from his Communism and Christianism, Brown blasted his fellow bishops and the theo- logians of the Church for their blind following of the literal words of ancient Creeds. He declared that the members of the Industrial Workers of the World were the most Christ- like that he had ever known.46 The final act of deposition came as scheduled, on time and 441bid.; Edwin Belknap, A History of St. Paul's (New Orleans, 1926), 44; New Orleans States, October 10, 1925. 45New York Times, October 11, 1925; New Orleans Times-Picayune, October 11, 12, 1925. 46New York Times, October 12, 1925; Soard's Directory of New Orleans (New Orleans, 1925).</page><page sequence="16">50 LOUISIANA HISTORY in the place previously announced. The service was brief, with a few prayers; then came the announcement that Brown had been found guilty of heresy by the two trial courts and by the House of Bishops. Brown's name was then called three times; Brown's proxy, Theodore Schroder, a psycholo- gist and an Old Catholic Theological professor, said nothing; and then Presiding Bishop Talbot solemnly deposed Brown in front of several bishops and a few hundred persons in the congregation. Later Bishop Talbot addressed the House of Bishops, saying that the ceremony had taken place. The House responded by removing Brown's name from the roll of bishops. Brown, who did not attend the ceremony, in- sisted that he was still a bishop in the Old Catholic Church, and that by its action the Episcopal Church had committed itself to extreme fundamentalism.47 As a last blow, Judge Louis Burns of the Federal District Court in New Orleans denied Brown's petition for an in- junction. The judge claimed that he lacked the proper juris- diction over the case since the bishops were only temporary residents of New Orleans. However, since the Court had denied the petition "without prejudice," Brown could still go to another court. (Later he would take his case to New York, the official residence of the new Presiding Bishop, John Gardiner Murray, but his luck proved no better in the New York courts.)48 Opinions came from all quarters about the deposition of the "atheist bishop." With sympathy for Brown's plight, the Churchman declared that the whole affair should never have occurred and that the deposition seemed cold and heart- less. The Nation set forth the opinion that fundamentalism had won a disastrous victory. While the Episcopal Church may have purged itself of heresy, it did so at the cost of tradition and common sense. It was to be hoped, The Nation wrote, that the federal courts would give Bishop Brown a 47New Orleans Times-Picayune, October 13, 1925; New Orleans States, Octo- ber 10, 1925; Journal of the General Convention, 43; New York Times, Octo- ber 13, 1925. 48New Orleans Times-Picayune, October 16, 1925.</page><page sequence="17">DEPOSITION OF BISHOP BROWN, 1925 51 fair trial because it was very clear to most that Brown did not receive one from his church.49 The Literary Digest, in reviewing secular papers around the nation, found much approval for the action of the House of Bishops and the Presiding Bishop. The Brooklyn Eagle commented that one could not reconcile Brown's book with orthodox Christianity, and even Liberals such as Dr. Gutherie, the controversial priest of St. Mark's-in-the-Bouwerie, felt that few could sympathize with Brown's actions or beliefs. The Wichita Beacon noted that "common sense dictates ex- pulsion . . . of members of an organization who differ com- pletely from the others." The Omaha Bee agreed, feeling that Brown should have left much earlier. According to the Springfield Union, even if one agreed with Brown's theology, one had to admit that it was in complete conflict with the theology of the Episcopal Church.50 Bishop Brown and his company quietly left New Or- leans, departing in a much different fashion from that in which they had arrived. In the Crescent City Brown had reached the climax of his theological career. For the rest of his life he would merely repeat the same charges, support the Communist Party, and attempt in vain to be reinstated in the House of Bishops. From New Orleans, Brown returned to his home in Galion. Later he went to Chicago to address the Communist-inspired American Negro Labor Congress where he praised the Negro and criticized the House of Bishops. From Chicago, he traveled to New York to appear with Communist leaders such as Benjamin Gitlow.5' After these appearances he re- turned to Galion to write. In a volume, My Heresy, he out- lined his beliefs and his disagreements with the Episcopal Church. For the next few years Brown kept busy with his writing, turning out material advocating Communism and 49Churchman (October 24, 1925), 6; The Nation, CXXI (October 21, 1925), 449. 50"The Unfrocking of Bishop Brown," Literary Digest, LXXXVIII (October 31, 1925), 28-29. 51New York Times, October 28, 1925; January 10, 11, 1926.</page><page sequence="18">52 LOUISIANA HISTORY attacking the Episcopal Church and its bishops as insincere, vulgar, bigoted, fundamentalistic, and opposed to the truth. Despite this criticism of his church, he attempted in 1928, 1931, and 1937 to be reinstated as an Episcopal Bishop. In 1937 Brown died in Galion, Ohio, leaving most of his fortune to the Communist Party. The leaders of the party, William Z. Foster and Earl Browder, officially eulogized Brown in a prepared statement: The death of Bishop William Montgomery Brown has robbed the working class of one of its noblest friends. A son of the people with a heritage of poverty and toil in his youth, Bishop Brown dedicated the last 20 years of his life to the cause of labor and oppressed humanity.52 Bishop Brown never returned to the Crescent City to which he had come in the mood of a winning crusader and which he had left after a shattering defeat. He never doubted that at this Convention he was the victim of the insincere tyranny of orthodoxy. While from an orthodox Christian point of view Brown's theology could never be in harmony with the traditional ideas and practices of the Church, no one can doubt his courage or sincerity in expressing and preaching what he believed. Friend of the working man, Communist, and heretic, Bishop Brown may have been the only Modernist of note in the 1920's to carry his belief to its logical conclusions, regardless of the consequences or damage to his prestige. 52Daily Worker (New York), November 2, 1937.</page></plain_text>
