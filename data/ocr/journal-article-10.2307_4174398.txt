<plain_text><page sequence="1">"My Sweete Foo": Emelye's Role in The Knight's Tale by William F. Woods R ~l ECENT scholarship on the Knight's Tale has assumed, more often than not, that its great theme of human will and human destiny is carried by Theseus, the most fully realized charac- ter in the tale. Analyzing the role of Theseus has clarified his, and the tale's, relationship to late-medieval chivalry.' Yet I believe we can better grasp the substance of the Knight's Tale by addressing it as a poem which, as McAlindon suggests, is essentially concerned with the ways human affairs make manifest "the dynamics of universal nature," 2 a poem which assumes that men are microcosms, displaying the same inner polarities and tensions that appeared in the creation and in the fall of man. These concerns, and the complex of ideas related to them, make the Knight's Tale part of a tradition of medi- eval nature allegory rooted in Plato's Timaeus, and including, among other works, Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy, Bernard Silvestris's De Cosmographia, Alain de Lille's De Planctu Naturae, the Romance of the Rose (mainly, Jean de Meun's continuation), and Chaucer's Parlement of Foules. Each of these works more or less overtly reflects an account of the creation in which the divine idea (Nous) was impressed upon matter (Silva) and man through the mediatory office of Nature (Natura) I See, for example, Walter Scheps, "Chaucer's Theseus and the Knight's Tale," Leeds Studies in English 9 (1977): 19-34; David Anderson, "The Fourth Temple of the Knight's Tale: Athenian Clemency and Chaucer's Theseus," Studies in the Age of Chaucer, Proc., No. 2 (1986): 113-25; Kurt Olsson, "Securitas and Chaucer's Knight," Studies in the Age of Chaucer (1987): 123-53; Daniel Kempton, "Chaucer's Knight and the Knight's Theseus: 'And Though Th&lt;tt He Were Worthy, He Was Wys,"' Journal of Narrative Technique 17 (1987): 237-58.

But it is crucial to recognize that Theseus's authority is balanced and conditioned by natural forces of love and change that are far more subtle and deeply derived than even his prudent statesmanship. It is this "natural jus- tice" that we see reflected in the tantalizingly empty, mirror-like role of Emelye, who must be weak to manifest the powerful hand of nature in human affairs, yet must also have her quintessential moment of free choice in order to show forth the power of God's will in man. Emelye's deeds are simple and few, compared with the exploits of Theseus, or even the struggles of Palamon and Arcite, yet she is eventually the focus of every important episode. Her passive beauty motivates Palamon and Arcite, but as I intend to show, her prayer to Diana is a crucial act of will in a narrative where love and will undergo sustained analysis. Her timid, private prayer, an apparently minor investment of self, appears nevertheless to decide the public conflict that creates the outcome of the tale. Emelye is initially presented as a mirror of Venus, an irresistible, faceless face of love. Yet simulta- neously, and with increasing obviousness, she is also revealed as a servant of Diana, an interface with nature, a sweet and terrible media- trix by whose agency Palamon and Arcite are divided and, in a series of conflicts, drawn to their separate fates. As an ambivalent mediat- 3The tradition of nature allegory has been carefully studied. See, for example, George D.

Taken together, these patterns represent complementary levels of meaning, different ways of knowing the world, which constitute both the "reality" and the rounded "wholeness" of this chivalric tale. The fundamental pattern for these relationships emerges from Theseus's adventures in Scythia and at Thebes, which demonstrate his reasoned balancing of anger and "pitee." The lovers' triangle, a balance of opposed wills and de- sires, comes next, followed in Part III by the triad of stellar influences 5 The intellectual principle fundamental to Emelye's role is a commonplace of the Platonizing tradition of 12th-century nature allegory, namely that opposites (like God and the world) can be joined only by an intermediary that shares in the two natures it joins. In Alain's De Planctu Naturae, Nature becomes God's Vice-regent, the "mistress of his mint . . . striking various coins of things according to the mould of the exemplar" (Pr. 4; Sheridan, 146). At a lower level, the macrocosm (the elements), and the micro- cosm (the humours), are each "yoked" together in a discordia concors because each of the four elements or humours shares a quality with two others (e.g. the hot and moist sanguine humour shares the heat of choler and the moisture of phlegm, but is opposed to melancholy, which is cold and dry). Thus Nature is herself "a cosmic go-between," as Rowe (note 3) says (24), and natural harmony is everywhere present in the inter- mediary bonds that yoke the dissimilar elements of creation together to shadow forth the divine plan. In a fallen world, of course, the bonds that represent divine love tend to become chains of love, or worse, chains of mere desire. Consequently, the nature figures that we encounter in poetic narrative are often ambivalent ones like Nature in the Romance of the Rose, or like the two aspects of Venus in the De Planctu Naturae or in the Parlemetit of Foules (see Economou [note 31, 85-87, 137-39). That is why Alain's Natura allows Venus to take over her task of superintending the generation of crea- tures (with disastrous results), and why Emelye, despite her descriptive overtones of natural beauty, is mistaken for Venus as she strolls about in her May garden (see Rowe [note 31, 13, 23-24). Cf. M.-D. Chenu, Nature, Man and Society in the Twelfth Century, trans. Jerome Taylor and Lester K. Little (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1957), reporting on the "synchretism" of Honorius of Autun: Man, . . . who exists within Nature, is himself a nature. The fact that he is spiritual, that his nature is in consequence endowed with liberty, and that he is thus caught up in the history of salvation in which his own liberty encounters that of God, does not undermine the fundamental condition in which he was created. The very play of his liberty is meshed with the laws of Nature: Natura is not only mistress of the universe and of all generation that takes place within it; she is also moderatrix of virtue.

McCall's excellent work on the Knight's Tale in Chaucer Among the Gods: The Poetics of Classical Myth (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1979). My analysis parallels McCall's at various points, but I have retained those sections because they support an overall interpretation which does not resemble, although perhaps it does not contradict, McCall's conclu- sions about the tale. McCall sees the planet-gods and their oratories in Theseus's noble theater as an allegory of Justice which finds its rationale "in a cluster of conventional notions drawn from Aristotle and from medieval philosophy" (73). Thus Venus (the concupiscible appetite of the mind's "sensitive" aspect) and Mars (the irascible appe- tite) come to represent the virtues of Temperance and Fortitude when balanced against each other and aided by the intellectual virtues of Justice (i.e. Jupiter) and Prudence (Saturn) (84). This complex of ideas does fit the character relationships and in some ways even the action of the tale. Its weakness is its failure to account for the centrality of the Emelye-Diana-Satum complex-and that is what my essay attempts to do. Notice also that McCall's fourfold allegory of justice, which he derives from Giles of Rome (Aegidius Romanus), De Regimine Principium, may be answered by a passage from Guillaume de St. Thierry's De natura corporis et animae: As the body consists of four elements which give it life, so the reasonable mind has four elemental virtues, which are prudence, temperance, fortitude and justice. From these four elements, so to speak, the rationality of the mind is formed.... And as the whole nature of the bodily life is cen- tered round three powers, that is, the natural in the liver, the respiratory in the heart and the animal in the brain; so the spiritual and rational use is summed up in three capacities, that is, rationality, concupiscibility and irascibility. (Migne, PL i8o, cols. 717-18, but also available in Oeuvres Choisies de Guillaume de St. Thierry, ed. J.-M. Dechanet [Paris: Aubier, 19441 1 quote Colin Morris's translation in The Discovery of the Individual 1050-1200 11972; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 19871, 78.) Guillaume cites the four virtues as the basis of reason, but in his account of mental life ("rational use") he uses a tripartite division reminiscent of Plato's "psychology"- a division which seems to me to be analogous to Theseus's and Emelye's "mediations" between Palamon and Arcite, and which is probably closer to the tradition of Chartrian nature allegory than the discussions of the four virtues in Giles of Rome or St. Thomas Aquinas. Perhaps this is also a good place to follow McCall (64) in acknowledging our debt to Charles Muscatine, "Form, Texture and Meaning in Chaucer's Knight's Tale," PMLA 65 (1950): 911-29; both of us are trying to extend Muscatine's observations about the bal- ance and order that characterize the style and structure of the Knight's Tale, contributing substantially to its significance. 7 In "The Heroine in The Knight's Tale," Studies in Short Fiction 5 (1968): 119-27, Allen B. Cameron also detects four levels of meaning in the tale. He argues that Emelye's "sym- bolic significance emerges on four interrelated levels of meaning: psychological, natural, social, and cosmic" (120). Although our analyses differ considerably, our basic assump- tions seem broadly compatible (e.g., "The Knight's Tale is clearly less a realistic character study than a narrative and symbolic movement: a progression from disorder to order, from mental anxiety to consummate acceptance" (127). Cf. Elbow (note 3): "the poem moves from a static, symmetrical opposition to a state of complex, paradoxical process"</page><page sequence="5">280 Emelye in The Knight's Tale The Knight's Tale begins as legend-the "received," paradigmatic memory of the chivalric world-then enters the clouded world of will and desire, and then the causally prior world of the planet-gods, nature's Usiarchs. Our final view of the tale takes form gradually, against a background of Ovidian nature myths, legends again, but linked together in a paradigm of primal causes, a nature allegory of human destiny. Like Dante's Commedia, this "circular" narrative de- velops in two concurrent ways: it expands in scope, and it traces a journey inward.8 As if seeking an answer to Arcite's question-"What is this world?"-the focus widens, going from personal to public and from the immediate concerns of love and loss to the transcendent ones of life and death. At the same time, the examination of motives ("What asketh men to have?") presses ever deeper toward the inner man (or woman), the core of human intent. To understand the role of Emelye, or any other character in the Knight's Tale, we must first consider the role of Theseus, who is a living exemplar, not only for Palamon and Arcite, his younger, less seasoned counterparts, but for chivalric conduct in general. And the key to Theseus is balance, which is in turn a trope for integrity, "com- pleteness." At the beginning of the tale, his success in war derives from "his wysdom and his chivalrie"-the ancient noble virtues of sapientia and fortitudo-while at the close, his corresponding virtues of wisdom and eloquence knit up the ravelled ends of Palamon's court- ship and settle the affairs of Thebes. As John Burrow says, Theseus displays the characteristic strengths of a man in his prime not his "first age," like Arthur in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, but the splen- did high summer of his life: "gretter was ther noon under the sonne" (863).'1 Just as Athens, the eternal city of sweet reasonableness, is the (93). See also John Halverson's seminal article on "Aspects of Order in the Knight's Tale," Studies in Philology 57 (1960): 606-21, and Brooks and Fowler (note 5), 142. 8Cf. Rowe (note 3): "Thus the intellectual journey through the cosmos is also a journey through the self.... It suggests that if one understands and imitates the har- mony of the cosmos, one can harmonize the discordant in oneself. The regaining of Eden for Alain [in the Anticlaudianusj, as for Dante, is a consequence of a simultaneous exploration of the world without and the world within" (23). 9 John A.

What it means to be the complete man in this chivalric world is demonstrated by Theseus's adventures in Scythia and at Thebes. The campaign against the Amazons serves as a love adventure, and the conquest of Thebes, a passage at arms; together, they create a bal- anced narrative of love and war, the two great focuses of chivalric life and of medieval romance. This primary division would in itself be sufficient to introduce the contrapuntal adventures of Palamon and Arcite, the one devoted to Venus, and the other to Mars. But like his subsequent actions in the tale, Theseus's heroic exploits develop in a series of bifurcated distinctions, so that we cannot but choose to see his every act as an exemplum for evenhandedness or the temperate life. His campaign in Scythia, for example, includes both war with the Amazons and a marriage to their queen, while even Ypolyta herself is described as being both "faire" and "hardy." The conquest of Thebes demonstrates a similar balance, but this time the terms of the dialectic are drawn not from the narrative logic of adventure, but from civil governance. Confronted by the noble Theban ladies at the temple of the goddess Clemence (the ancient virtue clementia), he responds with immediate "pitee" and departs immediately to make war on Thebes. Thus he has shown mercy to the ladies while handing out stern battle- field justice to the tyrant Creon, "Fulfild of ire and of iniquitee" (940), the very opposite of a temperate ruler like Theseus. These balanced virtues are, however, dependent upon what we might call the first cause of Theseus's governance, his success in war. He is the greatest conqueror of his time-in fact, that is the first thing we are told about him (859-63)-and his preeminence in war enables him to exercise his other virtues. Appropriately, one of Theseus's icons is his battle flag, which bears a red image of Mars on a white ground: red for Mars and victory, and white, perhaps, for mercy. The other 1I Cf. Kempton (note i): "Here at the beginning of the tale, Theseus is a pure embodi- ment of the French tradition, the romance ideal perfectly, superlatively fulfilled" (24). Later in the tale, however, Theseus's authority will be qualified by events brought on by Saturn, through the agency of Emelye. A number of critics have argued that this shift of perspective on the chivalric world is related to an ambivalence in Theseus's role. To my mind, the best of these attempts is that of Walter Scheps: "The Theseus whom we find in the Knight's Tale then parallels Plutarch's Theseus, a morally ambivalent, highly complex individual, more virtuous than not, but ultimately unable to impose his will upon events" (29).</page><page sequence="7">282 Emelye in The Knight's Tale flag is his pennant (an identifying, or "personal" flag) that bears an image of the Minotaur, in beaten gold. The Minotaur "penoun" is an allusion to Theseus's legendary jour- ney to Crete, where with the help of Ariadne he penetrated the laby- rinth and killed the Minotaur, thereby freeing Athens from the neces- sity of sending its finest young men and women to Crete every year to be devoured by that dreadful half-beast. Theseus the "conquer- our" has ended that unnatural practice just as he subdues the warrior women and restores Thebes to order-Thebes, where Creon left the dead unburied in the land of the living, turning the natural order "up-so-doun." Both in Scythia and at Thebes, Theseus has rectified improper governance. According to the tradition of political thought passed down by the Greeks, women were not fit to rule because, for one thing, they were passionate, not reasonable beings.12 And Creon, avenging his son by desecrating the dead, provides another example of unmanly surrender to the passions. Hence the significance of his defeat by Theseus: With Creon, which that was of Thebes kyng, He faught, and slew hym manly as a knyght. (986-87) But the extreme anti-type of Theseus the rational prince is neither government by women nor by tyrants, but the "tyranny" of the Mino- taur, lurking at the heart of his labyrinth-in mythic terms, the jungle of animal passions, where the senses reign and reason is utterly sub- merged. The sinister fascination of the Minotaur legend lies mainly in its mingling of rational and animal (the golden pennant implies a vic- tory over the darkness), but there is also a contrast between the blind complexities of the labyrinth and the civilized customs ("gyses") that bind together the good society. As the temperate ruler, then, Theseus is balanced in both act and intent, a living exemplum for the younger knights whose story makes up the body or "remenant" of the Knight's Tale. This balance is so essential to his role that the eldest of the Theban ladies, herself a queen, uses it as an invocation to identify his excellence and thereby secure his aid: 12 See Page DuBois, Centaurs and Amazons: Woman and the Pre-History of the Chain of Being (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1982) and William B.

Woods 283 She seyde, "Lord, to whom Fortune hath yiven Victorie, and as a conqueror to lyven, Nat greveth us youre glorie and youre honour, But we biseken mercy and socour." (915-18) His glory and honor stand for who he is; his victory as a conqueror and his mercy reflect his typical actions, each balanced by the other. To describe Theseus this way is to create a legendary portrait of the "worthy duc"-worthy, that is, to "drawen unto memorie." For as in many romances, the historical frame of the Knight's Tale is a way of "re- membering the future"; it offers a ground for understanding the story, and an emblem of its future development. Theseus's early adventures illustrate the recurrent tendency of this narrative to present qualities or actions as paired alternatives-a familiar epic convention, if we re- member Odysseus, pondering on the one hand and on the other- and to mediate them with a third quality which is itself balanced by a negative anti-type. That is, Theseus the just and merciful ruler "con- tains" or takes power away from a war-like woman and an angry man, while both of these symbols of fallen reason are overshadowed by an inhuman legend of the moral and social chaos that lies beyond barba- rism, on the nightmare margins of the chivalric world. In effect, the legendary-historical frame for the Knight's Tale resolves assumptions about social governance into mediated opposites. We are going to find that similar distinctions underlie the love relationships in the story of Palamon and Arcite. II The narrative emerges from heroic legend on the May morning in Part II when Emelye rises before dawn to greet the spring. Here, the fields of battle give way to the garden lawn, as Theseus's story- an iconic reminder of the principles by which chivalric order is pre- served-is displaced by the main plot, which contains the sentimental misadventures of Palamon and Arcite. Theseus's adventures show how "pitee" and anger can, when governed ("mediated") by reason, produce right actions that preserve the social order; the difficulties of Palamon and Arcite demonstrate how unmediated desire and will dis- astrously complicate the lives of individuals, thereby creating a need for Emelye's "mediation," which enables the natural balance that heals the social order.</page><page sequence="9">284 Emelye in The Knight's Tale In this first of four "nature" scenes, everything about Emelye is flowerlike and fresh, and as she strolls around the garden, singing, we probably hear an echo of paradise, the springtime of the human race. Indeed, the passage has less to do with Emelye's beauty than with her innocent response to the season, which says to every "gentil" heart, "Arys, and do thyn observaunce" (1043-45).'3 Later in the tale, we will see Emelye make other "observaunces" to Nature-first the hunt, then her prayer to Diana, and finally her ministrations at the funeral pyre. In the garden and in the temple of Diana, she appears as a priestess of Nature, garlanded and engaged in ritual activity; at the hunt and at the funeral pyre, she is the executrix of the laws of Nature, hunting the great hart and lighting the fire that signifies the end of Arcite's life. Thus, even though Emelye's stroll among the flowers is mannered and conventional-a love vision cameo-she also begins at this point to manifest the intimate and tragic relationship between man and nature that is gradually revealed in this tale."4 The imagery of her description initiates this transformation. Her white-and-pink complexion, delicate as lilies and roses, echoes the white and red "balance" motif from Theseus's banners, providing it with natural associations which are later deepened by Palamon's and Arcite's loyalties to Mars and Venus. Inherent in this motif is the theme of mortality, which emerges finally in the blood and milk used as funeral libations in Part IV. Emelye's yellow hair, braided down her back a yard long, is another detail which suggests the close association of the human and the natu- ral. We see this golden hair again in the temple scene-"hir brighte heer was kembd, untressed al" (2289)-this time crowned with a garland of "grene ook cerial." The bright hair and (funereal) oak leaves are opposed yet complementary motifs, just as in the garden, Emelye's 13 On the significance of the recurrent springtime in this tale, see Halverson (note 7), 6o6-12; Cameron (note 7), 123-25; and Lorraine Kochanske Stock, "The Two Mayings in Chaucer's Ktnight's Tale: Convention and Invention," /EGP 85 (1968): 206-21. 14 Hope Phyllis Weissman, "Antifeminism and Chaucer's Characterization of Women" in George D. Economou, ed., Geoffrey Chaucer (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1975), 93-110, says that Emelye's portrait in the garden is "an emblematic realization of the central impulse of courtly life, to transmute nature into a work of art" (99). I agree in part: the portrait belongs to a highly conventional scene which reflects the courtly sensibilities of Palamon and Arcite. Weissman proceeds to argue that in this and other scenes, Emelye "has become an automaton, . . . a scroll of parchment that the chival- ric mind has wrought" (ioi). But when a mirror for courtly life like Emelye's portrait comes progressively to reflect the power of nature, the shift in field of reference may well suggest a revaluation of chivalric views, rather than "the elimination of [Emelye's] independent will" (iol).</page><page sequence="10">William F. Woods 285 yellow braid is brought together, in metaphor, with "the lylie upon his stalke grene" (1036). The natural and courtly associations that cling to green and golden are familiar to readers of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, another narrative concerned with the necessary conflicts and compromises between chivalry and nature. Less obvious are the con- nections which appear in retrospect, as the golden braid is answered by Theseus's golden chain of love, and the green stalk by the "chain of trees" in Arcite's tall green funeral pyre. In the garden scene, these simple color motifs are pleasant but unremarkable, working mainly to establish Emelye's attractiveness and social rank. But at the end of the poem, when the themes of change and stability have been fully developed, the green of nature's changes and the golden continuity in change that represents the "prescience" of the "firste moevere" con- tinue to resonate in our memory of the early garden scene, as if to suggest that the seeds of man's fall, and of the love and death of Pala- mon and Arcite, were present already in that emblematic vision of earthly paradise. Palamon and Arcite are divided by this vision of paradise, for they respond to it in very different ways. Their paired complaints-the climax of Part I-reflect their separate intents. Arcite's reaction to free- dom is to feel exiled from grace: But I, that am exiled and bareyne Of alle grace, and in so greet dispeir That ther nys erthe, water, fir, ne eir, Ne creature that of hem maked is, That may me helpe or doon confort in this. (1244-48) In despairing of help from any living creature-indeed, from any element of creation-Arcite, at least in metaphor, moves beyond life itself. In the course of the narrative, he rejects his bond of blood- brotherhood, leaves prison, changes his identity, and finally departs for "ther/ I cam nevere, I kan nat tellen wher" (2809-10), as the narra- tor says. But wherever Arcite is going, it is the series of "exiles" that typifies his life. Returning to Athens, he sees Emelye daily yet remains an interior exile, "banished" by his foreign-sounding cover name and his assumed inferior rank. Our sense of Arcite's "exile" is sharpened by his rustic and touching proverb about the "dronke man" (1260) who has lost his way home. But where will is blind, chance must be king, and so it is not surprising</page><page sequence="11">286 Emelye in The Knight's Tale that exile is accompanied by a tendency to explain events as the "will" of fortune: "Wel hath Fortune yturned thee the dys" (1238). There is, appropriately, an implied element of chance in the events of Arcite's life. When he leaves Athens, "His nekke lith to wedde" (1218): if he returns, his life is forfeit-as if it were a gambling token. Later, after the tournament, this pledge is called in-"He pight him on the pomel of his head" (2688)-and he must pay in kind. Theseus, the warrior duke, has also served Venus and Diana, but Arcite lacks such an in- terior balance, or inner direction, and so he prays to Mars, invoking the "fortunes" of war. Palamon, by contrast, complains about confinement. While Arcite escapes into empty despair, Palamon feels stifled by his bonds, even though he is apparently unwilling at this point to break them. He begs for freedom (1281-1333), but he will spend most of his time in prison, and he is destined for a marriage of state. His role bears a formal resemblance to that of the older brother in the ancient Tale of Two Brothers,"5 who eventually follows and redeems the doomed sibling whose boldness led to his being frozen by a witch. While Arcite is so active that he seems to contribute to his own glorious, if lonely down- fall, Palamon is so passive that the force of nature (love) alone seems to shape his destiny. Thus the twin-like outward resemblances between Palamon and Arcite, and their overt complaints, merely heighten the essential contrast between their inner tendencies or "true intents." They represent opposed extremes, types of active and passive willful- ness who gaze helplessly toward Emelye, each held by passion in a different prison of the self. Their outcries dramatize the fundamental difficulties that love and life impose on man's free will: Palamon's will is "imprisoned" by the constraints of society and nature, while Arcite suffers from an unconstrained and undirected freedom (i.e. "exile"). Part II dramatizes the separation between these differing intents. For as Palamon and Arcite are about to "darreyne" the fate of Emelye in a combat as equal and meaningless as a game of chance, the royal hunting party rides up, and it is the lovers themselves who are "dar- reyned." In separating them, Theseus plays the mediator, as he did for the Scythians and Thebans. This time, however, the locus of action is a glade, and he shares this natural arena with Emelye, the object 15 "The Two Brothers" ("Die Zwei Bruder"), The Grimms' German Folk Tales, ed. Francis P.

The ensuing lines analyze Theseus's decision to spare Palamon and Arcite, and his decision displays the balance of qualities we have come to expect in him. At first, he shakes with anger, just as Palamon did before the duel. Yet "in his resoun" he excuses them both, for his anger is balanced by "compassioun/ Of wommen" (1770o71) .16 As if to emphasize this point, we are allowed a direct view into Theseus's heart, the seat of his thoughts and emotions: And in his gentil herte he thoughte anon, And softe unto hymself he seyde, "Fy Upon a lord that wol have no mercy, But been a leon, bothe in word and dede, To hem that been in repentaunce and drede, As wel as to a proud despitous man That wol mayntene that he first bigan. That lord hath litel of discrecioun, That in swich cas kan no divisioun But weyeth pride and humblesse after oon." (1772-81) To be like a "leon" is to be mastered by "animal" passion-like Pala- mon and Arcite fighting, blood-soaked, in the glade; like Creon (an- other "proud, despitous man"); and like the Minotaur itself. Such a man is blind to mercy and thus incapable of rational judgment. But Theseus then looks up "with eyen lighte" (1783)'7 and invokes the god of love. In Part IV, he will invoke the greater love of the "firste moevere," rationalizing the cruelty of fate and "answering" the temple prayers of Part III. Here in Part II, he excuses the folly of the lovers, answering their complaints in Part I. For even though their dueling 16 Cf. Elbow (note 3), who provides a similar analysis, but places more emphasis on Theseus's sympathy and forgiveness (83-86). 17 Here, and at the beginning of his long speech in Part IV (I: 2984), Theseus's glance (how and where he directs his eyes) reflects his settled will and enlightened judgment. Thus it contrasts with Palamon's and Arcite's peering down into the castle garden, which causes them to fall in love with Emelye, and it complements Emelye's significant glance down at Arcite, just before his sudden fall. As Elbow (note 3) points out, the argument of The Consolation of Philosophy depends in part on "a visual-spatial model for knowing: knowing as seeing" (42). Cf. Boethius, The Consolation of Philosophy, Bk. V, Pr. 5: "Let us rise, if we can, to the summit of the highest intelligence; for there reason will see what in itself it cannot see" (Richard Green, trans. [Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1962], 114).</page><page sequence="13">288 Emelye in The Knight's Tale is blind and absurd-like their earlier debate in the tower-it is, as Theseus says, a necessary response: all moot ben assayed, hoot and coold; A man moot ben a fool, or yong or oold. (1811-1 2) And just as these young men must experience all of love's ups and downs, Theseus the seasoned governor must of necessity hear both the boys and his ladies, so that he feels both anger and pitee, "hoot and coold." He must hear all the requests and then create a balance between them, and between the emotions they engender. Such a bal- ance enables him to know the "divisioun" between the lovers' pride and humility (certainly they have both) and thus to forgive them "al hoolly" (18i8), creating social harmony out of discord.'8 Theseus's mediation between Palamon and Arcite in Parts I and II anticipates Emelye's choosing between them in Parts III and IV. In each case, there is a choice between justice and mercy, or between arms and love. But while Theseus's humanely rational decision preserves a formal order by rescheduling the duel, Emelye's apparently helpless wish precipitates the change and death which will restore a "natural" order. The recurrent metaphor for the course of nature in Part II, as in the tale generally, is the hunt, where the "grete hert" doubles for the heart of the lover. The exemplary hunter is Theseus; once a vic- tim of love, he now serves Diana-is "hymself the grete hertes bane" (1681). But Palamon and Arcite are still the harts, and Emelye, once the Venus of the boys' love garden, now anticipates her future role as she rides all in green to the hunt. As so often in folktales and in Ovid, the hunters have become the hunted, and they will pursue Emelye until nature and fate run them down. Knowing less about Palamon or Arcite "than woot a cokkow or an hare" (i8io), Emelye is an unlikely huntress. Yet just as Palamon's and Arcite's characters reveal little beyond their orientations to Venus and Mars, Emelye's characteristic transparency of character reveals all the more clearly her ambivalent role as Love's mirror and Nature's media- tor. In the garden, she was a love object with an innocent, flower-like sexuality. Here, she is dressed in nature's colors, and as Palamon and Arcite duel savagely in the glade, she follows a great stag to its death. 18 For a discussion of the Temple of Clemency and the central relevance of that principle to the heart and mind of Theseus, see Anderson (note i), esp. 123-24.</page><page sequence="14">William F. Woods 289 In Part III, she prays to Diana, goddess of fertility, hunting ("harvest") and death (Nature's changes); and in Part IV her prayer is, in effect, answered by Saturn, whose terrible power is reminiscent of fate itself, which is essentially a higher order of change or the summation of all changes."9 It is important to keep in mind, however, that the role of Emelye implies the powers of both love and change. Her emerging "huntress" role does not reflect the displacement of Venus by Diana-a triumph of generation over eros-but rather the inevitable bond between love and natural change, between love and death.20 This connection helps to explain the otherwise puzzling appearance of Venus at the end of Part III, where her tears move the will of Saturn, arranging the death of Arcite. For just as Nature and Genius enlist the aid of Love's barons to force the castle of Jealousy at the conclusion of the Romance of the Rose, both Diana and Venus are figured by Emelye as she prays. Thus Emelye remains for both Palamon and Arcite a vision of love, the pur- pose and the eternal promise of life; but for Arcite, at least, she is also the anti-type, the ender of his life. III The second half of the Knight's Tale begins with the oratories repre- senting the motive forces that create the conflict over Emelye. These influences are held in a dynamic balance: the "signs" for Venus and Mars, in this tale, are white and red; but Diana has an oratory made from both "alabastre white" and "reed coral" (1910), as if to suggest that she is somehow related to both. Moreover, each influence is in itself ambivalent. Before the painted figure of Venus stands Cupid, blind, with "arwes brighte and kene" (1966); at the feet of Mars is a 19 Cf. Boethius (note 17), Bk. 4, Pr. 6: The changing course of Fate is to the simple stability of Providence as reasoning is to intellect, as that which is generated is to that which is, as time is to eternity, as a circle to its center. Fate moves the heavens and the stars, governs the elements in their mixture, and transforms them by mutual change; it renews all things that are born and die by the reproduction of similar offspring and seeds. This same power binds the actions and fortunes of men in an unbreakable chain of causes and [yet], since these causes have their origins in an unchangeable Providence, they too must necessarily be unchangeable. (92-93) "The highest order of change" would be Providence, in which cause and effect are collapsed, as it were, in the Now of eternity (Cf. Elbow, note 17). 20 Cf. Stock (note 13), who identifies Emelye "as a complex, enigmatic combination of qualities suggesting both Flora and Diana, the antithetical goddesses who represent two very different versions of love" (212).</page><page sequence="15">290 Emelye in The Knight's Tale wolf, red-eyed, devouring a man (2047-48); and before Diana's por- trait, a woman crying out in the midst of a long and difficult labor ("tra- vaillynge") (2083-84). In this tale, love, "nature" (here, childbirth), and especially war are painful imperatives; each promises a kind of joy, but also grief, suffering, or death. In this trinity of gods, Venus has pride of place. Her temple is de- scribed first, and Palamon is the first to pray, because love rules the world: "For as hir list the world than may she gye" (1950). Her vast power is witnessed by the heroes and other powerful persons con- tained by the walls of a love garden-caught in Venus's "las." As in the Romance of the Rose, the walled garden suggests the inner world of love-self-consistent, exclusive, and confining. It is an allegorical version of the garden in Part I, where Emelye roamed freely (not being in love) while Palamon peered at her from his cramped cell. In Part III Palamon's prayer to Venus accords with this enclosed gar- den motif when he asks repeatedly to "have fully possessioun/ Of Emelye" (2242-43), to "have my lady in myn armes" (2247), to "have my love" (2250). Wishing to possess Emelye, he himself is "contained" by desire. Venus herself, in this temple painting, is crowned with a rose gar- land. This is one of ten garlands that appear in the course of the tale, creating a pattern of motifs that hints at the separate destinies of Palamon and Arcite, and at Emelye's part in them. For example, Emelye wears a garland of flowers as she walks in her garden, Venus wears roses, and "Jalousie," a garland of yellow marigolds. In con- trast, Theseus returns in victory from Thebes crowned with laurel leaves (1027), Arcite makes himself a garland of woodbine or hawthorn leaves (1507) as he rides forth at sunrise in Part II, and Emetrius, Arcite's champion, also wears a crown of laurel (2175).21 This dialec- tic between flower and leaf, reminiscent of literary debates between summer and winter, or soul and body, is later resolved when Arcite, with his "coroune of laurer grene" (2875), is laid to rest on his funeral pyre, which is topped with "gerlands, hangynge with many a flour" (2937).22 Flower and leaf burn together in this pyre to commemorate 21 Lycurgus wears a heavy "wreath" of gold, which balances the green garland of Emetrius, just as Emelye's long golden braid alternates with the green-stalked lily in Part 1, and the golden chain of love matches the catalogue of trees in the green funeral pyre in Part IV. 22 See Stock (note 13), 210, for some useful background on debates between flower and leaf.</page><page sequence="16">William F. Woods 291 Arcite's consuming love, as well as the victorious death that releases him from all such desires. The imagery of fire also characterizes Arcite's prayer to Mars. These are the fires of love: Thanne help me, lord, tomorwe in my bataille, For thilke fyr that whilom brente thee As wel as thilke fyr now brenneth me. (2402-4) Yet the repetitive, almost incantatory listing of love's fires, the cutting of his hair and beard, the incense cast into the fire, and "victorie" make this long prayer point unambiguously forward to the description of Arcite's funeral pyre. And that fire, its "armes" stretching out, its green top reaching toward heaven, is (among other things) a figure for dis- persion, a diametrical contrast to the containing walls of the theater, the walls of Emelye's garden, and inevitably, the walls of Venus's gar- den of love. The sacrificial motifs in Arcite's prayer sustain his earlier theme of exile, then, just as the motifs of possession in Palamon's prayer recall his prison tower.23 Emelye's prayer is to Diana, goddess of the moon, the hunt and the underworld. Diana is more briefly and ambiguously described than either Venus or Mars, and her oratory lacks the detail and visual exten- sion of the great walled temples in Thrace and on Mt. Citheroun, per- haps because nature is worldwide, its center everywhere. Her temple paintings are scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses that imply the inter- penetration of man and nature, the liminal boundary between man's nature and the natural world around him. In each of them, a woman or man is changed into some natural form; a role is reversed (a hunter becomes the hunted); and this transformation is linked with sexual desire, so that these four painted scenes, and presumably the count- less others that cover the walls, do in fact recall stories "Of hunting and of shamefast chastitee" (2o55).24 The first painting is of "Calistopee," one of Diana's huntress- maidens. Like so many others, she attracted the attention of Zeus and 23 Probably the clearest opposition between love and arms is expressed by the dwell- ings of Venus and Mars. Both "Citheroun" and Thrace are isolated from the cities of men, but while Venus's temple is a social center, its walls containing more than a thousand unhappy lovers, Mars's temple is surrounded by a forest of dead trees and inhabited only by figures of misfortune and a thousand dead bodies (2014). 24The locations of these tales in Ovid's Metamorphoses: Callisto (II), Apollo and Daphne (I), Actaeon (III), Meleager (VIII).</page><page sequence="17">292 Emelye in The Knight's Tale conceived his child and, having left the service of Diana, was changed into a bear by Juno. Finally, out of pity, Zeus transformed Callisto and her son into constellations (Ursa Major and Minor). In this tale, Zeus consummates his desire without penalty, of course, but the woman (a huntress) is cruelly punished. As a bear, she becomes the quarry, the "harvest" of nature-which is to say that having been drawn into the cycle of reproduction, she must inevitably die and thereby com- plete the cycle. Nevertheless, the subsequent transformation of both mother and child into stars, and especially the never-setting pole star, implies the eternal aspect of conception that transcends its inherent mortality. In the succeeding tales this unequal balance of punishment be- tween male and female is gradually reversed. In the tale of Apollo and Daphne, for instance, divine passion is frustrated and the archer-god becomes a target for Cupid's arrows. And although Daphne's trans- formation draws her into nature's dying generations, it does grant her wish for chastity. For Actaeon, however, there is no compromise. This hunter looks upon Diana in her nakedness, is changed into a deer, and is torn apart by his own pack of hunting dogs. He desires and is in turn devoured, one "greed" answering the other in a kind of self-conquest, while Diana and her maidens remain inviolate and untouched even by pity. The climactic tale of Meleager and Atalanta is briefly noted, but it is the most terrible, as well as the most meaningful for Palamon and Arcite. In Ovid, when Meleager gives the Calydonian boar's hide to Atalanta, his uncles object, and he slays them both. Learning of her brothers' deaths, Maleager's mother casts into the fire the half-burned branch which, according to the three fates, represents the life of her son. And so Meleager, still in the forest, is consumed in agony by an inner fire. Like Callisto, he pays dearly for crossing the will of a female authority, but here it is the containment ("chastitee") of the male, not the female, which is at issue. There is a clear progression in these four scenes from the punishment of a young woman to the self-inflicted punishment of a young man. Meleager's death is the clearest example because the fire that kills him is, like passion itself, a flame that burns from within. And with this central metaphor of self-consuming desire, we come full circle to the fire images used so often to describe Arcite's love, his service to Mars, and his death. Like Venus and Mars, Diana stands for a variety of stellar influ- ence and thus for a basic human impulse. Venus represents the urge</page><page sequence="18">William F. Woods 293 to identify the self with another, Mars the impulse to enhance the self, and Diana the desire to merge the self with nature's innocent harmony.25 Each of these intents creates its own limitations: Palamon worships Emelye during years of passive confinement (he could pre- sumably have escaped sooner); Arcite spends himself in empty per- formances; and Emelye herself would rather go hunting-go through the motions of life in this surrogate for the pursuits of love and arms. These influences are forced into conflict by the beauty of Emelye, a Venus-figure singing and garlanded with flowers; their resolution is prepared by her sacrificial prayer, when like a nature deity, she puts on a "crown" of funereal oak leaves and initiates the cycle of love and death by declaring herself the sexual "quarry." As Emelye prepares to light the sacrificial fire, her garland of oak leaves foreshadows the oak grove, cut down to make the funeral pyre (2865-67), but her bright hair, "untressed" for prayer, emphasizes her sexuality and suggests a way to read the difficult passage about her washing: This Emelye, with herte debonaire, Hir body wessh with water of a welle. But how she dide hir ryte I dar nat telle, But it be any thing in general; And yet it were a game to heeren al. To hym that meneth wel it were no charge; But it is good a man been at his large. (2282-88) These lines create a momentary lapse in the narrator's detachment, as he makes what appear to be side comments on the bathing of Emelye. This lapse in taste is hard to justify in the context of the sacrifice, but it does make us aware of Emelye's sexuality, the significance of 25 Cf. Boccaccio (note 34), gloss to Teseida 7:30.1: "For an understanding of this li.e. the temples of Venus and Mars] it should be remarked that in every man there are two principal appetites. One of these is called the concupiscible appetite, whereby man de- sires and rejoices to have the things which, according to his judgment-whether it be rational or corrupt-are delightful and pleasing. The other is called the irascible appe- tite, whereby a man is troubled if delightful things are taken away or impeded, or when they cannot be had" (McCoy, 196). See also McCall (note 6): "Each oratory defines and elaborates upon a natural instinct which is seen to be the cause of widespread ruin and destruction. . . . But the total construction, the whole allegory, says something quite different. It represents, in fact, an ideal of human nature on the natural level, for in each oratory an instinctive tendency receives its proper place, its one and complete honor; it then finds itself balanced by other, equally valued instincts, and is finally bound in or controlled by 'a just circle"' (72).</page><page sequence="19">294 Emelye in The Knight's Tale which is suggested by an echo: "it is good a man been at his large." In Part I, Palamon twice referred to Arcite as being "at his large" (1292, 1327) and free from prison. Arcite's characteristic freedom is thus the background for Emelye's plea to Diana that she be spared the ven- geance "That Attheon aboughte cruelly" (2300-2303). In the story of Actaeon, of course, punishment came not to the naked maidens bath- ing with Diana, but to Actaeon himself, who had looked upon that forbidden sight. Arcite, we may remember, spied Emelye in the gar- den and knew immediately that she was a woman, while Palamon thought she was a goddess and immediately prayed for her mercy ("compassioun" [mllob). At the point of death, Arcite will also pray to Emelye for "mercy" (2808), but in Part III, he is still the man who looked "impiously" upon Emelye, as the narrator seems to do in the present scene. Emelye's sexuality, however, is exactly what she tries to deny in her prayer to Diana, a two-part lament about self and world which is similar in form to the complaints of Palamon and Arcite in Part I. She begins with Diana's three epithets, "goddess of the wodes grene," "Queene of the regne of Pluto," and "Goddess of maydens," and these titles may suggest a dialectical conflict in her attitude toward marriage. The green woods imply the changing cycle of the year, natural change. But "Goddess of maydens" implies the asexual, "timeless" part of life which precedes maturity, childbearing, aging and death. For Emelye, "to ben a mayden al my lyf" (2305) is, in a psychological sense, to deny change and be free forever. By contrast, the "compaignye of man" (2311) may for her suggest eternal bondage-the kind of "hell" Pala- mon and Arcite complained about earlier, and specifically the sort of death-in-life enjoyed by Pluto's queen.26 Emelye's rejection of natural change and death is followed by the second part of her plea, where she rejects the love that creates those "metamorphoses." She asks Diana to "sende love and pees" between Palamon and Arcite: surely this would quench "hire hoote love and hir desir" (2319). But while the "fair chain of love" may link the stars 26 Brooks and Fowler (note 5) also identify a "psychological allegory" in Diana's three aspects, concluding that "Emelye is afraid to enter on the next stage of life, marriage, with all that that signifies" (127). They then argue that "[Emelyej has to pass from the patronage of Diana to that of Venus, and learn Venus' ways, just as Theseus has to be instructed in the ways of Saturn" (128). This seems essentially correct, but I would characterize this "instruction" as movements of the will-significant choices-rather than the progressive psychological development that Brooks and Fowler seem to imply.</page><page sequence="20">William F. Woods 295 in harmony, love in the world, and especially the love of young men, is often inseparable from "hoote love" for someone like Emelye. Yet even Emelye seems to know this. She would, forgivably, rather remain a maiden-free, "at her large"!-but her next words are a deliberate, pragmatic surrender to necessity and to her own sexuality: "if my des- tinee be shapen so ... send me hym that most desireth me" (my italics, 2323-25). Like Palamon and Arcite, Emelye is constrained by desire (in her case, the desire to retreat into "nature"), yet by mastering that desire, she becomes capable of meaningful choice. Indeed, this is the central choice, the representative act of the Knight's Tale.27 Emelye's straightforward acceptance of the fated conditions of life in this tale- love and change (i.e. mortality)-is precisely what makes possible her free participation in the course of events, confirming the "divisioun" between Palamon and Arcite and pointing directly to their marriage and death. Clearly, Emelye dislikes having to choose and ends her prayer with another plea for maidenhood. But instead of releasing her from having to choose (to "judge"), Diana informs her that the eternal word of the gods (the "jury") has ratified this reluctant justice, as the altar fires shall declare. Twice Theseus let his heart be swayed by women- in effect, his mercy flowed from their gentil hearts. In a similar way, Diana's refusal to judge seems to imply that the course of events may be carrying out Emelye's decision: the fires on the altar foreshadow a destiny that has either been created or fulfilled by her tiny but genu- ine assertion of free will. And so when Diana leaves with a clatter of arrows, we understand that Emelye has in effect chosen her man, and fate is hunting for the other one. Our sense of that fate becomes stronger at the close of Part III when Diana the huntress is replaced by "pale Saturnus the colde." Diana's fire declared Emelye's "aventure of love" (2357), but Saturn's ancient "wysdom and usage" will mediate between the gods themselves to settle the "strif" between Palamon and Arcite at its very source. The sense of doom in this scene arises mainly from the appalling scenes of misfortune-"Myn is the drenchyng in the see so wan" (2456)- but it is prepared for by the structure of Part III, which first surveys 27 Palamon's choice-his moment of self-mastery-is when he breaks out of prison (both his cell and his "prison" of passive desire) and thus gains a real possibility of win- ning Emelye. Arcite's choice is his deathbed recommendation of Palamon as a husband for Emelye. Theseus's choice (like Emelye's, a judgment) is when he balances anger with pitee and lets the boys live.</page><page sequence="21">296 Emelye in The Knight's Tale the temples of Venus, Mars and Diana, then changes that order when Palamon, Emelye and Arcite rise to pray in accordance with the plane- tary hours of their gods.28 Emelye takes the medial position (the hour of sunrise), so that Saturn's eventual mediation between Venus and Mars reflects Diana's medial position, while also confirming Emelye's choice between Palamon and Arcite. Moreover, when Saturn comforts the tearful Venus (like Theseus heeding his ladies, and Diana aiding fearful Emelye) a tender heart has again guided the will of a severe judge. And paradoxically so. For Saturn is a remote, forbidding deity; his wide course oversees the murky no-man's-land where all of life's ventures terminate in death and ruin, and social and moral forms (like the Minotaur's humanity) lose their distinctness in a dark, chaotic flux. Disturbing as Saturn may be, however, his upholding the division between Palamon and Arcite in Parts III and IV is a clear parallel to the way Theseus separated them in Parts I and II. Similarly, Emelye's courtly behavior in Parts I and II faintly shadows forth her mediatory role, but Diana and Sat- urn reaffirm that role in Part III, suggesting that entering the cycle of nature and thereby embracing mortal change is nevertheless a fruitful alternative to the sterile pursuits of love and arms. For like the waxing and waning moon, Diana implies the mingled promise of fertility and death. That is why she finds a place mid-way between love and war, and why hunting and the service of Diana can be appropriate for Theseus, who has already spent his time in the ranks of Venus and Mars. The anti-type to Diana's mediation through natural change is Saturn, who represents the depths of change-its roots in chaos-just as Diana, the goddess "To whom bothe hevene and erthe and see is sene" (2298), suggests the higher affinity be- tween change and "destinee," the "ministre general" of God. It is paradoxical, though characteristic of the symmetry of the Knight's Tale, that the "divisioun" stemming from the contrary "complecciouns" of Venus and Mars (and from the opposed intents of Palamon and Arcite) should be resolved by an ancient, chaotic influence that is itself the grand summation of all contraries;29 and paradoxical again, though 28 See Vincent DiMarco's note to 1:2217 in The Riverside Chaucer. 29 Cf. Alain de Lille, De Planctu Naturae: "Accordingly God . . .leagued together things hostile to one another by generic opposition . . . and He changed the strife of contrariety into the peace of friendship .... it was His will that by a mutually related circle of birth and death, transitory things should be given stability by instability, end- lessness by endings, eternity by temporariness and that the series of things should</page><page sequence="22">William F. Woods 297 fitting, that Saturn's fateful power, drawn from the widest reach of heaven, should be guided by the diffident wish of Emelye as she sur- renders to the yoked necessities of human desire (Venus) and natural change (Diana). IV Part IV opens with yet another bright morning, a parallel to the events of Part II; now as then, love engenders combat, and Theseus ensures proper decorum. The difference here is scale. Lists of tourna- ment gear are followed by crowd scenes and "battle" scenes that create an impression of variety and multiplicity. The breadth of these public scenes is accompanied by an expansion in vertical field. As Theseus appears at a window of his palace, the people press forward with a "heigh reverence" (2531) to hear his "heigh discrecioun" (2537), and their cheering "touchede the hevene" (2561). This expansion in nar- rative scope prepares us for Theseus's chain-of-love speech, whose summing up of worldly existence is also organized by metaphors of extension in space.30 Theseus's acts in Part IV again imply a responsible balance. In Part II he was an "evene juge . . . and trewe" (1864), and after the capture of Palamon, he will again be "trewe juge, and no partie" (2657). With the same evenhanded prudence, he neutralizes the abilities of Pala- mon and Arcite by adding matched companies of knights, so that the outcome can be blamed on fate and God's will, removing the need for revenge. These judgments are the "wisdom of his chivalry." Yet chival- ric order must yield, finally, to the changes of nature, and Theseus's repeated attempts to preserve harmony by "letting fate decide" are overshadowed by the fateful catalogue of bad fortune recited by Sat- urn, whose very nature it is to create "strif and drede," disaster, and certain death. But it is Emelye who signals Arcite's fate. In the moment before the fury appears, Arcite looks up into the stands and she casts down at him a "freendlich ye," yet her glance recalls the painting in Diana's temple, ever be knit by successive reversals of birth" (Pr. 4; Sheridan, 145). See also Chenu (note 5) on disorder as a lesser good and a partial aspect of divine wholeness (21-22), and Boethius's passage from Bk. IV, Pr. 6, quoted in note 19. 30See my "Up and Doun, To and Fro: Spatial Relationships in the Knight's Tale" in Rebels and Rivals: The Contestive Spirit in The Canterbury Tales, ed.

Emelye's involvement in Arcite's fate is also reflected by his death- bed speech, where balanced half-lines carry the linked themes of death and love through several variations and unite them in a final oxymoron: Allas, the deeth! Allas myn Emelye! Allas, departynge of oure compaignye! Allas, myn hertes queene! Allas, my wyf, Myn hertes lady, endere of my lyf! (2773-76) "Allas, the deeth! Allas, myn Emelye!" initiates these themes, while "Departynge of oure compaignye" introduces the central metaphor of division: the whole reduced to parts. The next two lines restate the division motif as a distinction between "myn hertes queene" and "my wyf," which widens into "Myn hertes lady" and "endere of my lyf," reversing the order of "Allas the deeth! Allas myn Emelye!" so that in an elaborate chiasmus (a:b::b:a), "Emelye," "hertes queene," "wyf" and "hertes lady" are framed by "deeth" and "endere of my lyf." Such ambivalence about wives will be variously exploited in the Wife of Bath's Prologue, the Merchant's Tale, and the Franklin's Tale; here, "Myn hertes lady" reminds us of Arcite's brief victory ride, when he looks up at Emelye and she, casting down a friendly glance, is "al his chiere, as in his herte" (2863). "Now wol I speken forth of Emelye" (2816), the narrator continues, but what she does continues to involve Arcite. Her first act, as Theseus takes her "fro the corps away" (2819), is to swoon, and she swoons again after lighting the funeral pyre. Each time, at the departures of Arcite's soul and body, she dies a little with him.

The narrator's reliability in this sort of passage is not un- questionable (see, for example, his comments on Emelye's bathing 12284-881), but even if his ironic commonplace does reveal Emelye's intent, the structural symmetry between her gesture and Diana's earlier pose implies that her presence here is somehow linked with her prayer in Diana's temple and with Arcite's death.</page><page sequence="24">William F.

Love and death are coupled here as they are in "my sweete foo," and Theseus reaffirms that symmetry when he gives orders to make Arcite's funeral pyre in the same green grove where he suffered the fires of love. When Arcite is laid on his bier, his naked sword is placed in his hand and others carry his spear and shield. But the "bowe Turkeys" (2895), distinguished by its foreign make, seems an odd weapon for Arcite. Actually, there are three bows in this tale: the bow of Cupid, with "arwes brighte and kene" (1966); Diana's bow (2347), with arrows that "clateren faste and rynge" (2539); and Arcite's bow (no arrows mentioned). The bows that represent Venus and Diana, who were aided by Saturn, seem deadly enough, but Arcite's bow seems to be an ornamental weapon not intended for real shooting or hunting.32 Dead heroes, obviously, do not hunt, and so the absence of arrows may simply be a memento mori. But in retrospect, it appears that Arcite was also poorly equipped for the hunt of love. Like Apollo (the archer-god), Arcite the hunter became the hunted, so that Emelye (like Daphne) is finally the victor in this heart-hunting. This admittedly faint association between Emelye and Daphne is reinforced when Chaucer describes the funeral pyre, That with his grene top the hevene raughte; And twenty fadme of brede the armes straughte- This is to seyn, the bowes weren so brode. (2915-17) The pyre is vaguely anthropomorphic, "his grene top" reaching, the "armes" stretching wide, and the narrator acknowledges this odd figure by explaining dryly that arms are bows. When Chaucer's nar- rative calls attention to itself, there is usually an implication we are meant to catch, and I believe that is the case here. In the Ovide Moralise, Daphne's metamorphosis is described in an abbreviated effic- tio, moving from top to toe, and part of this description parallels Chaucer's lines: Ses crins dorez et flamboians Devindrent feuilles verdoians; 32 A similar motif is the Franklin's "anlaas" (dagger), "whit as morne milk" (GP 357- 58).

The funeral of Arcite creates a powerful sense of an ending. We feel a deep change occurring as the grove is cut down to make the pyre, and the catalogue of trees felled becomes a figure for totality, as if all of nature had fallen with Arcite. The departure of the wood gods and all the birds and beasts reinforces this general sense of an age pass- ing into oblivion, as if, somehow, a sort of innocence has been lost. It is just possible that the reference to nymphs, and the lines about how "the ground aghast was . . . of the sonne brighte" (2931-32) are meant to reinforce the earlier allusion to Daphne and Apollo. And for a medieval audience, Arcite's corpse fire might have recalled the flam- ing sword that drove Adam and Eve out of paradise. In any case, it is a long and sobering passage that resonates with lost hopes. For the 33 C. De Boer, ed., Ovide Moralise, Vol. 1 (Amsterdam: Johannes Muller, 1915).

Woods 301 world of Theseus, Arcite's death represents mortal necessity, a prac- tical evil with which all diplomacy and splendor must compromise. For Emelye, it means leaving her life as a maid-a sort of pastoral freedom-and entering the urbane life of a noblewoman. With these hard truths, nevertheless, the narrative passes from timeless wish to the human reality of Theseus's speech at the end of the tale. In that speech, Egeus's commonplace wisdom about living and dying is elevated into philosophy, as Theseus makes his Neo- Platonic argument that we are all merely fragments ("parts") of the Creator's stable and eternal "hool"; as such, we live our parts of eter- nity and die, and thus are reabsorbed into the wholeness ("propre welle") from which we were originally "dirryved" (3037-38). Connect- ing the eternal whole with its scattered parts on earth is the golden chain of love, which stands for the stability and plenitude of creation. On the other hand, nature's cycles-the seasons, the changes of the moon, the birth and death of all creatures-have their own expression in the great pyre, a green "chain of trees" that dissolve in flame to sug- gest nature's law of constant change. There is no contradiction here. The green chain suggests change-nature's metamorphoses-and the golden chain, the divine continuity that runs through change and re- deems it. Still, there is a polarity implied by the stability of heaven descending link by link toward the passing and "corrumpable" (3010). And this implicit opposition between order and disorder creates the frame for a final structure of mediation which reveals the congruity between Emelye's necessary act of choosing and the universal balance of nature. Nature, we saw earlier, has three aspects that correspond to the three realms of Diana: goddess of heaven, earth and sea (including the moon, the green woods, and nature in general); "Queene of the regne of Pluto"; and goddess of maidens (2297-2300). The temple painting of Diana configures these roles by placing Diana on the back of a stag, with the moon and a woman in labor below her, and the "derke re- gioun" of Pluto somewhere below that (2075-82). The stag recalls the temple scenes "Of huntyng and of shamefast chastitee" (2055); the moon and childbirth belong to the world of birth, death and natural change; and the reign of Pluto is where no changes occur at all. As the painting implies, the cycles of change indicate the central "realm," the natural world that Emelye enters by choosing the man who will love her the most; in so doing she chooses marriage and chil- dren, with the surrender to and transcendence of time that childbirth</page><page sequence="27">302 Emelye in The Knight's Tale brings. If the Ovidian stories on the temple walls exemplify the as- pects of nature, then nature's changes are expressed by the story of Callisto, horribly transformed by her maternal fate, but transcending it as an eternal bear of stars. The realm of Pluto, however, is eternal in the same way that death is final. The underworld is where time's arrow points, and since there is no returning from that journey, its destination stands for posses- sion, prison, despair. That is what "the compaignye of man" means to Emelye in Part III, in contrast to the freedom to "walken in the wodes wilde," remaining in the "compaignye" of Diana, and a maid (2307-9). The myth that describes this fear of possession (or control, or rape) by a man is the story of Pluto and his bride Proserpina, goddess of the Spring, whom he abducted from the flowering fields and brought to reign with him in his dark kingdom. This story does not appear in the Knight's Tale, but perhaps there is a hint of it in Diana's title, "Queene of the regne of Pluto, derk and lowe" (2299). Diana's third realm (chastity and hunting) is not associated with any particular locale, but if the reign of Pluto stands for possession by men-the absence of choices and the containment of will-then the life of Diana's maidens may suggest an amazon's paradise, with a freedom of will unfettered by social or sexual bondage. It is also a state of immersion in the natural world, a loss of self that stands in polar opposition to the loss of self through possession by a man, society, Pluto, or death. The hunt is an asexual participation in the cycles of nature-a "harvest" of living creatures that constitutes a ritual obser- vance of death for those who (like young teenagers) know that they will never die. The myth of Apollo and Daphne reflects this state of maidenhood. Daphne preserves her chastity and her "freedom," but at the expense of losing herself entirely in the eternal innocence of natu- ral things; once the daughter of a river god, she abandons humanity altogether in becoming a tree (her escape does make her a success- ful huntress, since Apollo, an archer like Arcite, never recovers from Cupid's arrow, but wears a crown of laurel-becomes "tree-like"-in empathetic memory of her). Maidenhood, in this sense of sterile freedom, is an extreme ant incomplete version of the view of life in the Knight's Tale, just as the sterile imprisonment implied by Pluto's kingdom must be. Like the passion-bound Palamon and Arcite or the enclosed garden of Venus and the windowless temple of Mars, each represents an imprison- ment of self by the unmediated (and thus immature) desire either to</page><page sequence="28">William F. Woods 303 be willed or to will-to suppress one's will or to deify it. The maiden huntresses, racing in pursuit of their future, glide through an adoles- cent dream of eternal summer; and in the lost world of Pluto, king and queen live a nightmare of control, where act and intent can only repeat the past, as if locked in eternal winter. Both of these extremes deny change and time, which belong to the cycles of summer and winter, life and death-the "middle" world of nature, where Diana reigns as the goddess of the moon, childbirth, and eternal change. In this broader sense, "nature" in the Knight's Tale is natural law, a balance between extremes-the same sort of balance we saw in Theseus's judgments, Emelye's choice between Palamon and Arcite, and Saturn's "mediation" between Venus and Mars. These worldly balances are linked with the stable harmony of the "firste moevere" in an ascending hierarchy that is restated, in metaphor, by the golden chain of love, which passes down into the world where even the for- tunes of lovers reveal the divine order hidden in natural change. At every stage and thus at every level of the narrative, this fundamental pattern emerges,36 suggesting that a universal order manifests itself in chivalry, but much more profoundly in nature, guiding princes and lovers, settling the fate of men and cities. But if there is order in change, there is also disorder-the primal instability of matter (Silva, in the De Cosmographia) and the analogous instability in man's own microcosmic (and fallen) nature, that is de- scribed in the tradition of nature allegories,37 and contributes to the 36 Elbow (note 3) argues that Boethius bridges "the metaphorical cave/sky [i.e., earth/ heaven or necessity/freedom] opposition which dominates Books I-IV" by demonstrat- ing that "four degrees of knowing constitute a ladder linking the sky and the cave" (43). These four degrees of knowing-the senses, the imagination, reason, and intelli- gence-are themselves linked, in that the lower stages are included by the higher ones, like subsets (see Boethius [note 171, Bk. V, Pr. 4). Thus the senses and divine intelli- gence are different but not contradictory-they are, as Elbow says, "adjacent knowings of the same reality" (45). The four patterns of mediation I have distinguished in the Knight's Tale also represent four ways of knowing the world. They are linked in the same sort of expanding hierarchy and are themselves a kind of chain. These four stages of the plot are, therefore, like the great chain of love itself, a figure for the resolution of contraries or the bridging/balancing of extremes. 37 See Rowe (note 3), 2z-22, 24; Wetherbee (note 3), Platonism and Poetry, 181-83, 264-65; Economou (note 3), The Goddess Natura, 82-87; Bernardus Silvestris, 11:12: (Physis] was mistrustful of the coarse substance of the elements, and doubted that they would prove wholly adaptable [for the creation of man], for she saw in them the stains and the ineradicable evil of Silva. The violent and teeming state of matter in its primordial confusion terrified the prospective artisan.... The malignity of bodily nature and its teeming components might well make her fear- ful lest their instability should scom and repudiate all form, and mock her discipline. (Wetherbee, 117-18)</page><page sequence="29">304 Emelye in The Knight's Tale undercurrent of doubt that runs through this tale.38 The metaphoric connection between natural change and the principle of disorder or chaos is the burning of the catalogue of trees in Arcite's funeral pyre. The great fire lit by Emelye reduces an entire grove to ashes, along with dead Arcite and all the articles of sacrifice that sum up the world he lost. This is the ultimate metamorphosis, the dissolution of natural forms, which reveals the need for God's formative act of creation, but also the necessity for man finally to lose his world in death. Descent into chaos, random change, the loss of all form and meaning are what death means for man, wedded to his conscious reason, and that is what makes death/chaos the ultimate anti-type to the orderly changes of nature and the unchanging order of God. Man's horror of death and disorder is expressed in this tale by the myths of Actaeon and Melea- ger, where dismemberment suggests loss of identity ("the integrity of the self"), and consumption by fire, the final and absolute merging of self with the anomalous primal flux. Theseus's Boethian speech about departures and successions finds its "conclusioun" in the marriage of Emelye to Palamon, a human reflection of the grace by which the scattered parts of creation are subsumed again into the divine whole: from "sorwes two / 0 parfit joye, lastynge everemo" (3071-72). Theseus's matchmaking is his final mediatory gesture in the tale, and as before, he takes pity on those who need it most: And looketh now, wher moost sorwe is herinne, Ther wol we first amenden and bigynne. (3073-74) 38 Along with Dale Underwood ("The First of The Canterbury Tales," ELH 26 119591: 455-69), Richard Neuse, "The Knight: The First Mover in Chaucer's Human Comedy," UTQ 31 (1962): 299-315, was one of the first critics to argue that Theseus and the world- view he represents are meant to be seen in an "ambiguous light" (300)-that there are in the tale "symptoms of disorder" which may reflect "the larger social order [i.e. late-medieval England] in crisis" (311). Since I have just argued that the "order" of the Knight's Tale is sustained by its most profound source of disorder, I find it both plausible and suggestive that Neuse identifies in the ensuing Canterbury Tales another (analogous?) "order [that] arises from below": Over against the symptoms of disorder. . . there emerges from the Canterbury Tales the idea of what I would call a "comic society," whose order is not so much conceptual as it is pragmatic, being rooted (as it were) in the nature of things. In such a society the control or order arises from below, we might say, because nature is a function of (the comic) spirit. Men have the freedom to follow their natural inclinations, because by doing so they imitate the inner drive in all things towards their full being or perfection. But in so far as they deviate drastically from the norms of a publicly defined good, they are exposed to the censorship of laughter. (311)</page><page sequence="30">William F. Woods 305 His remarks to Emelye, however, are not so much a consolation as an argument, whose logic is underscored by a series of possessive pronouns. Theseus moves from his will ("my fulle assent," "my parle- ment") to what Palamon has done for Emelye ("youre owene knyght," "serveth yow"), to what Emelye should do for Palamon ("youre grace," "youre hond"), and pauses at "our accord"-his agreement with Emelye, but also, no doubt, the prearranged "accord" of Theseus and his parlement. Thus Emelye's will seems encapsulated or contained by the will of Theseus, as appears in the concluding line: "Lat se now of youre wommanly pitee" (3082, italics mine). Theseus has shown his "pitee," and Emelye should now reciprocate with hers, the moon of chivalry reflecting her sun. Theseus's offhand courtesy is merely a gesture aimed at preserving the grace of fin' amor and leaving intact Emelye's dignity-her illu- sion of free choice. At this point, however, we may remember that on earlier occasions when Theseus (I, II) and Saturn (III) were approached by sorrowing women, it was the ladies' will, combined with the pathos of their tears, that moved the lord, guiding his will to action. This final scene is no different. For in effect, Emelye has already chosen Palamon over Arcite, an outcome that Diana described as being the will of the gods and that Saturn reaffirmed by arranging Arcite's death. Certainly, it was not Emelye's wish either to love or be loved. But since she must be desired-love is the ineluctable force that drives the cycles of nature-she makes the best of it: while Theseus makes a virtue of the necessity of Arcite's death, Emelye has already made a virtue of the necessity of being desired. The paired necessities of death and desire form the basis for Palamon's marriage, just as they led to Arcite's funeral pyre. But while death is, in each case, the effi- cient cause, love is the final cause, the fundamental reason why Arcite pursued Emelye to his death and why Palamon, after eight years of struggle and further years of mourning, will finally marry her. And so Theseus's compromise with death merely parallels, and reciprocates, Emelye's prior compromise with the power of love that bridges death and therefore contains it. Here as elsewhere in the tale, chivalry follows nature, and nature is "bound" by the great chain of love. Theseus and Emelye (the "judges") and Palamon and Arcite (who are "darreyned") all dramatize the fun- damental yearning for earthly union that mirrors, however faintly, the wholeness of God. Emelye is central to the Knight's Tale because she is</page><page sequence="31">306 Emelye in The Knight's Tale the object of such desires, but far more because her decision to submit to marriage and enter the cycle of nature places her prior to Diana, Saturn and Theseus in the causal chain of events, making her the "first mover" in this narrative of human will and human destiny.
