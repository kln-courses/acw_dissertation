<plain_text><page sequence="1">Science and Religious Faith in Mutual Support James Houston Shrader For many years now we have been hearing about the conflict between religion and science. Actually this conflict has existed ever since ancient man called on both the magician and the priest for help in meeting his needs. Man has learned that he can succeed better by the use of science than of magic or of religion in making the world behave as he wishes. Science has earned this high place in man's respect. Those nations that have utilized science as the basis of their living have progressed to dominance in world affairs and to increased control of the forces of nature, all this through increased understanding of nature. Science starts with secular experience. It conquers distance, climate, night, disease, and has made inroads on the demands of death. All these accomplishments lie in the realm of man's physical needs. Man's Needs Fundamentally, man's basic urge is to survive, to keep alive. This expresses itself in the immediate, direct, and instant hunger of the body for food and water. These needs come first of all man's desires. These are the most basic because if not met, man dies - and then there is no further problem for him. But when these desires are met, even during their gratification, others begin to assert themselves. Among these are the requirements for shelter, for clothing, for sleep, and so on. All these have been called animal needs. When these have been more or less satisfied man seeks safety and security, as close to the level of his basic urge to survive. Rising above this need appears the feeling for belongingness. Man craves to love and be loved. The importance of this is recognized in the fact that medical authorities and social workers have found that when infants are deprived of affection they fail to develop normally and often wither away and die. It is a "must" in psychotherapy. Dr. James Houston Shrader, active in the Star Island conferences on Religion in an Age of Science, is editor of Religious Inquiry. He is chairman of the Division of Science and Mathematics and Professor of Chemistry at Eastern Nazarene College, Wollaston, Massachusetts. This article is a condensation and rearrangement of talks given before the Conference on Science and Religion at Claremont, California, May, 1959, the Intercollegiate Chemistry Society at Harvard University, in December 1959, and the Covenant Congrega- tional Church, Waltham, Massachusetts, in March 1960. His ideas are more fully developed in a forthcoming book. [231]</page><page sequence="2">The Christian Scholar Having all these man is not satisfied. He seeks approval and commendation from himself and from society. A related one beckons him on to self-realization, as the psychologists call it. This bespeaks the urge "to make something of our- selves." Man wants to excel in some sport or to win in games, in other words, to triumph in competitive struggle. All this bespeaks his urge to express himself. Beyond these lies another need, namely, the basic urge to understand and to know the reason for the existence and behavior of things all about us. The thirst for knowledge, the sense for the aesthetic, the social urge to share, all these are experiences universal to mankind. They have existed in man since primordial times. The Greeks valued all this in the ideas of truth, beauty, and goodness. While man was learning to keep alive and to control his environment to a degree, he began to inquire into the nature of his surroundings. He trembled at the noise of thunder; he was impressed with the occurrence of disease and death as mysteries; he marveled at earthquakes, lunar and solar eclipses, floods, tornadoes. He was attracted by the sublimity and grandeur of nature. Even paleolithic man's burial remains attest this concern - way back there. Through- out the whole history of the human race man has struggled to keep alive, to associate and to communicate with his fellows, and to seek encounter with the forces or powers that he intuitively felt gave meaning to his being and existence. These latter interests lie in that area of man's psyche or mind that is called the "spirit." From this platfom, so to speak, man reaches "up" to what he feels is the transcendent reality. This upreach of spirit expresses the religious motif. It is the oldest, the most widely prevalent, the most stable, the most inspirationally creative, the most culturally expressive of homo sapiens. Every art of civilization had its begin- nings in religion.1 It is the oldest of man's institutions and its followers number more than those of any non-religious culture-group. Hierarchy of Needs There seems to be a regular hierarchy of needs, a sort of graded sequence.2 When the "lower" or animal needs are met the "higher" ones begin to assert themselves. This advance, so to speak, is indicated by the decreasing emphasis on animal needs and an increasing emphasis on the purely abstract ones as man ^roeber, A. L., Configurations of Culture Growth.

The former may be grouped roughly about the physical requirements of the body, the latter, in the area of the spirit (the latest and most highly developed characteristic of mind) for "controlled expres- sion" in language and art, in theory, myth, and religion.3 The further development of this area constitutes man's expression of "soul,"4 the highest level of goal- seeking. Such a differentiation between body and spirit is not considered to be real in any basic sense: both are highly integrated parts of one living organism. Wholeness.

In the ultra-violet, beyond the sensory area, I have placed religious expression as transcendent of the physical and sensory. These areas of needs all merge into one another imperceptibly with no lines of demarcation between them. These spiritual areas have needs that are just as demanding as are those of the other areas of man's being, as for example, his need for vitamins. These spiritual needs express man's aspirations for fulfilling himself in areas beyond those of only physical well-being: they express his total experience. Values. The means for gratifying our needs are the grounds for our values. We prize that which we want and so we pay to get it. As gratification urges become satiated our cultural growth creates new needs which we strive for. The requirements of the organism are the biological ground for its basic values. All living human beings have them. We see them in a modified degree in the order of animals below that of man. These traits are built into the nature of things. They all indicate the way "the winds of the universe are blowing," as Dewey expressed it. These basic needs are fundamental for the health of the organism. Since our purposive endeavor is to live, then gratification of these needs cannot be wrong. (Of course, when abused, they may destroy us, as for example, when too much water drowns us.) The test of value is organismic health in a coherent setting that harmonizes with the best that we know. They indicate the direction that nature indicates for the person to travel. In this manner the virtues of love, altruism, goodwill, beneficence, sociality, and cooperation can be traced back in an unbroken line through the brotherhood of man, the gregariousness of animals, and the associative (reactivity) of inorganic entities, all expressing the same basic urge at their respective levels of consciousness and/or reactive sensitivity. The study of all such phenomena is the subject matter and objectives of the discipline of science. Science and Methodology "Science" as I use the word here expresses the point of view that insists on a rational explanation of the experience of apprehending phenomena by exper- iments and observations, leading to the formulation of explanatory theories that can be publicly validated. Its emphasis is facts and their public verification of overall hypotheses, theories, and doctrines. The word "religion" in this paper means a group-shared system of thought and action which orients the person in his ultimate concern physically, socially, and spiritually to Cosmic Reality,5 the philosophic name for "God." It is com- 5Shrader, James H., "What is Religion?" Religious Inquiry, No. 20, April 1958, pp. 1-4. [234]</page><page sequence="5">Science and Religious Faith in Mutual Support prised within the currently popular phrase "ultimate concern" but gives a sharper focus to one particular facet, so to speak, of man's interest. Knowledge is grounded on man's personal experience. By his senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste, he established vital contact with the world about him. By their use he was able to keep alive, and then to grow and develop as above outlined. Common-sense knowledge is what the man-in-the-street understands to be the nature of things. This enables him to distinguish dreams from reality. He does this by ascertaining whether the situation "makes sense." His court of last resort is the experience that he gets from his senses and his feelings in their correspondence with what he observes to be "out there." This common-sense outlook gives him a kind of practical know-how that usually gets him by, so to speak. However, he found that this procedure was not always completely dependable. For example, the earth seems to be flat and the sun to revolve around it, but now he knows differently, in fact, just the opposite. The kind of experience that leads to such conclusions as the latter is the procedure of science. Methodology of Science. In brief, the method of science comprises three main steps: First, the scientist gathers all the relevant facts that he can as apparently related to the question before him. Second, he devises a theory that seems to him to be a plausible explanation of these facts. This idea is at first called an hypothesis. It is always a guess, albeit an enlightened guess, that he believes will best describe all similar events. It might just as well be called a belief or a doctrine. All these words mean about the same thing with only relatively slightly different connotations. Third, if predictions from the hypoth- esis work out to give results as postulated, he considers that the hypothesis may be correct. But such compliance does not mean that the theory is absolutely true. May- be some other one might likewise fit the phenomena. Such has happened many times in the history of science. In fact, science can never absolutely prove irrevocably anything to be true. There is always the possibility that later knowl- edge may give a better basis for another answer. A recent example is Einstein's relativity theory that supersedes Newton's theory of gravitation. When an hypothesis has been verified several times, it assumes the "higher" level of being a theory, and when this is well substantiated over a long time, it is called a law. Operationally, this procedure as followed in the instant paper, is illustrated in Diagram II, as based on the epistemology of Margenau.6 The heavy vertical line represents the plane of nature, and all the objects of sense and phenomena of 6Margenau, Henry, The Nature of Physical Reality. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York, 1950, 479 pages, chap. 4, 5, 6. [235]</page><page sequence="6">The Christian Scholar experience lie in this area of perception. Each such "given " event is called a "percept" in this nomenclature. These are the beginnings and the termini of cognition. Experience moves from these sensory, spontaneous, given data to rational reflection which seeks to relate them to wholes or inter-connected patterns of knowledge and insight into the structure and functioning of nature. Each such hypothesis is called a "construct." The guiding relations between percepts and constructs, the leap from fact to hypothesis, are called "rules of correspondence." These are in fact metaphysical principles, correlating explanations with immediate experience. In the diagram, those rules of correspondence which connect percepts with constructs are represented by double lines; those that connect constructs with one another are called formal ones and are single lines. In other words, a formal connection sets a construct in a purely logical relation with another construct; an epistemic (double line) connection links the construct with data (facts of experience). By this procedure we move in an orderly manner from the multifarious events of everyday life - a great haze of all kinds of experiences - to an insight into nature which shows it to be an orderly, consistent, harmonious pattern that is so reliable, so to speak, and cognizable that man can predict what nature will do under certain circumstances that he himself can impose. In other words, he can invent a science that enables him to control certain aspects of nature because he understands nature. This procedure is illustrated in Diagram II. Constructs are explanations that purport to relate diverse phenomena into a coherent whole. They remain as speculations unless and until they are verified in experience as being true. If A, then B. Verification involves behavior by the observer AS IF the construct (A) were true (B). So he plans experiments (expe- riences;, assembles equipment, and then proceeds to create conditions whereby the idea can be observed in its application as predictable events. He exercises faith that the test will reveal the correctness of the construct. Verification involves the step of personal commitment. Starting with any material (element) like iron or gold, we subdivide it until we have the smallest part that our art can apply; there still remains a sizeable particle. We believe that this can be subdivided into an atom - too small to be seen as such but postulated to be an entity. This is the atomic theory. On this hypothesis we arrange the atoms in a conceptual scheme called the Periodic Table; this advances our knowledge by reason of the insight it gives of the rela- tions between the elements and therefore a broader perspective from which to advance our knowledge. This leads to a further hypothesis as to the structure of the atom. Starting with the percept of a piece of copper (step # 1), we postulate the hypothesis of the atom (step # 2). From this hypothesis (a construct), [236]</page><page sequence="7">Science and Religious Faith in Mutual Support we postulate further that all atoms have a definite relation to all other atoms (step # 3), and then by step # 4, we postulate the structure. All this was inductive reasoning. Now, if the hypothesis of the structure is correct, then we can deduce that the atom can be broken down into electrical (charged) particles (step # 5): radio- activity (atom-smashing by neutron bombardment), which is publicly known by CONSTRUCTS PERCEPTS Ð¡ - Field P - Plane 1 Step #2 atom -^ - Step # 1 is observation of Step #3 /I I postulation Ð°Ð¿Ð£ chemical element i/ of an atom Periodic e, #4 Ð» Ð»/ Ð£ table Step e, #4 Ð» Ð»/ Ñƒ ^n Structure 'i ' - i Structure ' electrons ^ g+~r #1 is also observa- of atom tions on passage of 1 ^-Â»' 1 electricity through gases ' i -^' .

We started with experienced facts, set up hypotheses to explain these facts, and then validated the hypotheses by deductively arriving back again at a different set of facts. The sequence is facts to hypotheses (constructs) and then back to facts. The very nature of science is the motivation to explore, to adventure into the unknown, to probe unceasingly for wider and deeper insights into the workings and the nature of the universe. Science is the one great discipline that is continually seeking to find its errors. Therefore, it is dynamically self -correcting. It is not afraid to criticize itself. This practice does not discredit science. It enhances public acceptance. For example, no one thinks less of science because biochemists found that the calorific requirements for an adequate diet must be supplemented by taking vitamins. This dynamic keeps science on the march: it does not grow stale through stagnancy. Application of Scientific Methodology to Religion In just the same way that the scientist starts with data from the phenomena that he experiences all around him and then builds hypotheses on them to explain their behavior, so I have done in seeking to understand what religion "is all about." Since we cannot deal adequately with only an isolated area of man but must consider him as a whole - body, mind, spirit, and soul, as commonly held - I have surveyed wide and varied fields of man's behavior and interests that are embraced in the disciplines of physical science, biology, psychology, anthropology, sociology, historiography, aesthetics, mysticism, and religion. These supply public information as expressive of man's reactions to these multi- farious fields of experience. By his behavior and expressions, we interpret his characteristics - similarly to the way that we determine the structure of matter and its properties by observing how it behaves under various stimuli (reagents or reactors). On the other hand, the reaction of a known body (the reactant) to its reactors gives some idea of the corresponding nature or properties of the reactors themselves. Their interaction works in both directions - each reveals what the other is like. Applying this method to the subject of religion, I abstracted out of all available, observable phenomena that which is sensory and also that which is expressively-subjective (publicly known). This gave me a list of phenomena in each of the fields investigated. They constituted "percepts" in the P-plane of nature. Keeping within the conventional areas of each discipline, I postulated (by hypotheses) that these data are explainable as parts of a larger patterned structure. These parts are constructs, all linked by rules of correspondence into a network of supporting ideas. As we progress to the left with ever broader conceptualizations we regress finally to the extreme left, to Reality. This I have designated by the symbol "X." [238]</page><page sequence="9">Science and Religious Faith in Mutual Support In Diagram III (p. 241) I have collected some of the data from all nine realms studied. It illustrates how we can proceed inductively from public know- ledge of religious phenomena (that exists to some extent in every field of human activity) to beliefs (doctrines) that are supported at the start on verifiable evi- dence, publicly observed (facts of experience). Then by deduction I set up testable theorems to ascertain whether or not the construct (doctrine) is valid. For example, starting from the percept of organisms I set up the construct (hy- pothesis) of life. From the construct of life I set up another "higher" construct of mind. On this I set up a broader one yet, called spirit, and thence on to "X." Consonant with the scientific methodology I then test the truth of this construct by operational theorems. For example, since I postulate that "X" (as Cosmic Reality or "God") possesses the characteristics of personality, then the use of appropriate practices (analogously to the use of formulae and instruments in physical science) should be expected to entail a type of response such as that between two persons, namely, spiritual and other psychic rapport. Failure to experience such a response does not discredit the idea any more than the attempt to utilize radio signals without a receiving set negates the idea of radio waves. In religion the "receiving set" is a person who has committed himself to God in ultimate concern, thereby providing the sensitive psychic conditions necessary for receipt of spiritual power. The simplest idea that would explain all the observed phenomena that living human beings encounter is to postulate the being of a conscious cosmic reality. This instant approach is unique on two counts: it utilizes current scientific methodology and it is based on a wider spectrum, so to speak, of human artifacts than any other base with which I am acquainted. I give as much importance to man's consciousness, for example, as to inorganic nature and cosmic organization. Much subjective experience is publicly known: everybody knows what is meant by someone when he says that he has a toothache. We all know when a person is in love. Education certainly is subjective, and yet we can test it, even quantitatively. The whole art of medical practice is based on the interpretation of subjective states. Here also lie the fields of jurisprudence, political science, social relations, and much of psychology and mysticism. Again referring to "X" as having all the characteristics of the highest development of man (and presumably much more besides), we can best visualize it as a transcendent living person (at least) with aspects that are best described practically as "Heavenly Father," not in any explicitly anthropomorphic sense but as a symbol to facilitate spiritually-motivated disciplines, i.e., religious practices. Communication (conscious intercourse) between such a Being and man could not occur if there were no areas of similarity. Analogously, that is why oil and water do not mix - there is not enough nor the right kind of contact. Here is no merely cold, distant, First Cause, nor a "Divine Engineer" as such, [239]</page><page sequence="10">The Christian Scholar nor an impersonal Pure Being. It is a conception of a Cosmic Spring from which streams influences ("forces") that man can visualize best as the idea of a benign father, again, as "Our Heavenly Father." It means that whatever God may be in the totality of his Being He at least possesses all the traits that a living human being has, and personality is one. They must be alike to a degree in order to communicate. The Christian Religion The foregoing is the way that the Christian religion started. When John the Baptist was in prison he sent his disciples to inquire of Jesus as to whether he was the one, after all, for whom the Jews had all been looking. Jesus did not say straight out that of course he was the one, as John himself had previously asserted. Jesus said something entirely different, and highly significant. He said, "Go and tell him what John hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them" (Mt. 11:4,5). In other words, he told John to look around and ponder on what all this meant. Inference was held by Jesus to be more convincing than authoritative assertion. In like vein, the Apostle John in the first epistle recounts "That which . . . we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and touched" (I John 1:1). These events and others emphasize the importance of living experiences to validate religious truth. In fact, it was upon such down-to-earth facts that Jesus exhorted his followers to accept his teachings. He taught that "through their fruits ye shall know them." The Christian religion originally was a fact-based, doctrinal system whereby God the Father was seen only through Jesus, as St. John affirms. The evidence for belief in God was indirect. This makes it a construct. Belief in God is a doctrine (hypothesis) that man subscribes to as he encounters the record of the life and spiritual insights of Jesus. First came the observed facts of Jesus' life and ministry, and then came the doctrinal statements later. The writer of the Book of Hebrews asserts: "For whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him" (Heb. 11:6). Again the sequence: facts from Jesus' ministry, belief in God as based on these facts, and then expectancy of answered prayer, all summed up as facts, doctrine, facts (experience). Here we see the formula of the methodology of science: first the observed facts, then on them the formulated hypotheses (doctrines) that make these phe- nomena or events meaningful, and finally their validation through verification of prediction (rewards). The two disciplines follow a similar procedure. Service of Science to Religion.

In the first place, science makes increasingly possible our power to overcome the inertia of nature and to utilize it more and more so that we are enabled to devote time and effort to meeting our needs in the higher realms of consciousness as described above, e.g., the design of laborsaving devices of many kinds to release man from needless toil and to make possible such religious campaigns as the current Billy Graham crusades, peace marches for the abandon- ment of war, programs for the upbuilding of the under-privileged nations, and the meeting of the needs of man in health, food, and shelter. In the second place, science provides a mass of validated information for the construction of a cosmology that helps us to understand man and his responsibility to comply with nature's laws of health, and with interplanetary societal responsi- bilities. Furthermore, it furnishes a dependable methodology for arriving at an hy- pothesis or conceptualization of religion that harmonizes with all other expe- rience, thus making religion the most natural thing in the world. No longer would it have to rely on a man-made, complicated structure or system of doctrines (often contradictory) but would provide a basis for a simple, Jesus-like approach to God that uses a methodology that has world-wide acceptance. It does something more. Its methodology for erecting constructs on a basis of facts gives us an interlocking structure of concepts (doctrines) that are so mutually supporting that when, as, and if any one or even several should later be found to be incorrect, this new information does not invalidate nor even shake the strength and dependability of the whole structure. Its doctrinal structure would constitute a vast network of inter-related hypotheses (beliefs) which are connected by cross-references to other constructs in the system, analogous to struts on a bridge. This is illustrated in Diagram III. Here it is seen that the removal of any of several constructs (and even some percepts) does not entail the collapse of the structure. Finally, religion so conceived is more strongly based and convincing than when it rests entirely on authoritarian pronouncements of alleged private revela- tion, say, to Joseph Smith or to Mohammed or to other mystics. It makes religion intelligible to anyone who is disinclined to base his religious belief on the bare assertions of "authorities," especially when these have vested interests, professional positions to maintain, or ecclesiastical status to defend. Here is a basis that can be used to appeal to anyone who respects science but not religion, as for example, skeptical intelligentsia, agnostics, irreligionists, or communists. Service of Religion to Science. In the sixth century B.C., Pythagoras linked science and religion in a mystical interpretation of a rational order in the universe. Geometry arose by the priests of Egypt for measuring the land that had been inundated by the Nile. Astronomy arose in Babylon to set the times for sacred festivals. In England for centuries medicine and nursing were the work of monks [242]</page><page sequence="13">Science and Religious Faith in Mutual Support and nuns; St. Bartholomew is the oldest hospital. Practically all of England's older schools, as well as the greater part of Oxford and Cambridge, are religious foundations. Starting from the fountainhead of Christian theology as molded by Greek philosophy men's minds became trained to recognize a cosmic sense of order - the conception of the personal energy of Jehovah and the rationality of a Greek philosopher. The scholastics became gropingly aware of the organization of the universe, something not evident to unreflective men. This religious classicism developed the techniques of philosophical discourse. This made science possible. Without philosophy, the moral sense, and a strong ethical idealism, there would never have been - nor could there exist today - any science. Science in its spectacular modern form arose in a Christian setting. As Whitehead expressed it, this long training inculcated in man's minds the idea that there is a secret order of things that can be unveiled: the rationality of God. The clearest com- mon expression of this feeling is natural law.7 Experimental science emerged as an effective new intellectual discipline by the fostering of the Reformation.8 The rediscovery of the Jewish attitude toward nature as being good was direct protest against the Greek contempt for the natural world. The Greek preference for metaphysics had been further developed by Christian theology. The new emphasis on Jewish elements in Christian tradition brought an increased interest in nature, without which experimental science was impossible. It was the rise of the great universities out of the cathedral system in Europe that conserved the learning of the ancients, or fostered the streams that came into Europe from Moorish and Eastern sources. In these centers of learning, the discipline of science emerged out of philosophical rationalization. Science in its spectacular modern form arose in a Christian setting, was organized by Christian men of science (such as Galileo, Newton, and earlier Roger Bacon), and was promoted in Christian institutions of learning. Einstein is quoted as stating: "Certain it is that a conviction akin to religious feeling, of the rationality or intelligibility of the world lies behind all scientific work of a high order." 9 Wherever Christianity has penetrated the cause of education has flourished. These are the great centers where science has been encouraged to open up new avenues of knowledge which the world at large recognizes in technology. This is now the basis of our whole industrial plant, thereby creating a new area. Science and technology have captured the world's imagination and have provided an 7Whitehead, A.

[243]</page><page sequence="14">The Christian Scholar intellectual discipline that has won the world's respect and general acceptance. The rise of science has introduced and fostered a universally sharpened moral sense. Without the strong ethical idealism of intellectual honesty, conscientious devotion to acknowledging credit for the work of others, tolerance for the opin- ions of others, freedom of thought and speech for oneself and for others, personal honor, independence of thinking, originality and creativity in the pursuit of truth regardless of and independent of personal advantage or disadvantage taking priority over all other demands,1' science today would not be possible. Conclusion In summary, we see that science serves religion: (1) by facilitating man's control over nature in order to be free to pursue the quest for the higher values; (2) by providing a dependable methodology for conceptualizing religious truth that is harmonious with all of nature in one great cosmological whole; (3) by giving an inter-locking network of mutually supporting doctrines; and (4) by furnishing a methodology that has received worldwide acceptance. On the other hand, religion serves science: (1) by fostering science, particu- larly astronomy, medicine, and mathematics in connection with religious festivals and social service; (2) by training man's thinking into channels of rationality and philosophical rigor; (3) by breaking the power of Greek ideas of contempt for nature and restoring interest in the study of nature; (4) by developing the great universities and centers of learning around the cathedrals, thereby preserving the ancient insights and fostering exploration into the new; (5) by introducing educa- tion at high and low levels wherever organized Christianity has penetrated; and (6) by fostering a high moral sense and ethical practice that is universally recognized. The methodology of both disciplines follows, or may follow, similar patterns of sequential facts, constructs, and then fact again - "check and double-check." In ordinary language we call these the data of experience, the explanations of these data, and the prediction of new data by seeking to apply previous expe- rience. Religious thinking as well as scientific both collaboratively rise from earth-bound dimensions to cosmic ones, as Tennyson has so well expressed: "One God, one law, one element and one far-off event To which the whole creation moves." 10Bronowski, J., Science and Human Values.
