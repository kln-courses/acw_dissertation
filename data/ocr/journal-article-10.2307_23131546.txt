<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONSCIOUSNESS WITHOUT BORDERS: NARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY AND THE WORKS OF THOMAS PYNCHON Richard Hardack SAY SOMETHING ONCE, WHY SAY IT AGAIN? ETERNAL RETURN AND FREE INDIRECT RADICALISM IN AGAINST THE DAY As for Deuce, of course. . . . —Thomas Pynchon, Against the Day That this has all precisely happened before, but cannot be compared to anything now, is a proviso that applies as much to Pynchon's Against the Day (ATD) as to Gravity's Rainbow (GR).ATD is structured around a series of short-term and long-range repetitions through which characters iterate specific phrases the narrator has used and vice versa, and most characters, events, and speeches are revoiced and doubled. What is most striking about the narrative style of ATD—aside from the narrator's over-the-top addresses to the reader and references to an always already existing fu ture—is its use of repetitive phrasing that echoes every few pages, every few chapters, and across Pynchon's works. In Pynchon, with a few critical exceptions, repetition tends to enforce not difference, but identity: such a way of reading can of course seem fatalistic or paranoid, but it sometimes offers a way to forge liberating connections. To answer David Byrne's question in my section title, if you say something once, it doesn't mean anything: you have to say it again.2 In exploring the issue of agency in Pynchon's works, critics have tended to look at forces—chemical, political, economic, linguistic, sexual, and his torical—that determine individual and mass psychology, personal predi lections, and even bodily functions, but rarely at narration itself. But in almost all ways, "narratology" exists prior to all these other forces because Criticism, Winter 2010, Vol. 52, No. 1, pp. 91-128.

In Pynchon, these forces might at times even be the narrators. Pynchon's characters often imagine that they are being controlled by unseen historical forces, immanent interventions, and inexplicable repetitions and patterns. If "light might be a secret determinant of history" in ATD (431), what about invisible narrators? What if the real force is the one describing force? Narrators, of course, are filters who don't necessarily represent an autho rial viewpoint, even when they seem to coincide—they double perception and representation in some way. Pynchon, however, makes more of these generic fissures than do most authors. The narrator of ATD is an invisible counterforce to be reckoned with. While "it might be difficult for an ac cidental observer—or say a clandestine one—to judge the level of inno cence in the room," some more deliberate observer—or say some more obsessive one—might hint at his/her/their/its innocence or complicity with the events being described (502). In The Culture of Redemption, Leo Bersani proposes that Pynchon structures GR around the premise "that everything is connected, everything in the Creation," but contends the "hidden doubles" of that text generate paranoia—that is, its connections and duplications create an order be neath the visible that subverts the possibility of an authentic text.3 In a discussion almost predictive of ATD, Bersani argues that the paranoid double—the Real Text behind visible or ders—is inaccurately and subversively replicated as serial doubles that ruin the very notion of Real Texts. The story of Slothrop narrativizes a more general process of replicative positioning throughout the novel. If we have such trouble keeping track of what's going on in Gravity's Rainbow, it is perhaps less because of the multiplicity of characters and events than because so much of what happens has almost happened already.... Psychological and dramatic particu larities are blurred by parallelisms.4 In GR, "It all goes along together. Parallel, not series.... Mapping on to different coordinate systems."5 Events do not unfold in time, but in rela tion to one another. By contrast, in ATD, we are told such repetitions re flect "the genuine article, and the sub-structure of reality. The doubling of the Creation, each image clear and believable ... its curious advent into the world occurred within only a few years of the discovery of Imaginary</page><page sequence="3">NARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 93 Numbers, which also provided a doubling of the mathematical Creation" (133). (The phrase "doubling of the Creation" reflects its own replication from GR.) ATD here continues to establish itself as a double for GR, itself a text constructed of doubles. Some of these doubles in ATD, perhaps in cluding the narrators, are barely visible, as if they were "somehow, only fractionally present" (135). Professor Vanderjuice, however, also prolepti cally inverts the myriad of connections that hold GR together and con cludes, "early" in ATD, that "| tjhe frontier ends and disconnection begins" (53). Connection in Pynchon itself often functions as a form of doubling, because comparison tends to create near consonance—tropes become identitarian. (In transcendental writing—which I argue provides a con text for virtually Pynchon's entire body of work—metaphors often be come synecdoches, and synecdoches literalized.)6 This echoing is closely connected to ATD's radical reformulation and narrativization of time: "The doubles you report having produced are actually the original sub jects themselves, slightly displaced in time" (571). (Pynchon's works might also, at least in narratological terms, represent some original urtext slightly displaced in time.) But it is never clear whether the person displaced in time is the same person or some kind of doppelganger. Given all its doublings and displacements, one could say ATD takes place in "a zone of dual nature" (633), on a "Pythagorean or Counter-Earth," presided over by a series of semivisible forces and counterforces. Embody ing what we might consider the counterculture of an earlier era, ATD is framed by Counterflys; counter-Christian Eucharists; counter-Carnev ales; "Russian counterpart[s|"; "counter-cit|ies]"; "counter-templels]"; a "contra-Venezia"; "Anti-stone[s]"; Twin Vibes; sleep as a counterforce/ doubling of the "imaginary mirror-world," which might even host an "equal and opposite. . .. counter-transformer" to nullify the effects of Tes la's gigantic, free resonant circuit; and of course "counter-time" and "counter-light" (1021, 275, 123, 78, 454, 102, 581, 880, 585, 587, 632, 498, 34). ATD seems maniacally to dramatize William Slothrop's proviso that "[everything in the creation has its equal and opposite counterpart," in cluding GR itself (555). But in his introduction to 1984, Pynchon com plains that contemporary news media are required to present "balanced" coverage, "in which every truth is immediately neutered by an equal and opposite oneDisturbingly, this is also the way narrative works mATD. Pynchon's application of this iterated phrase to the real world could also be zeugmatic—that is, it represents a kind of intertextual ontological pun, or assertion that operates and yokes things together on multiple levels, and</page><page sequence="4">94 RICHARD HARDACK also characterizes a Gnostic or surrealist geography in which matter dou bles its equal and opposite spirit.8 But it also suggests what we might term a kind of reflexive entropy, a doubling that is simultaneously a self-cancel ing or neutering. An "equal and opposite" (ATD, 34\and GR, 55) or dou bled, creation might be far more pernicious than we thought. It is also possible the narrator in some fashion retracts every observation and prediction s/he (or some other narrator) makes in order to bring us back to some "neutered" zero valence, enacting a kind of representational entropy. What if the text not only has counter-narrators, but is controlled by principles of counter-narration, so that each new event not only must parallel, but retract, another? What if Vanderjuice's disconnections are just part of a counterforce that mirror connections? What if whatever has happened is also inverted? As for Deuce, whose name perhaps evokes the diabolical nature of duality, we then arrive already doubled over. We con sequently encounter not only narrator-counters, but at least two dialectical texts, leaving the reader the daunting task of synthesis. Drawing on Bersani's assessment of style indirect libre (or free indirect speech) in encyclopedic novels, and Dorrit Cohn's theories of transparent (or invisible) minds and psycho-narration, I argue that Pynchon's use of repetition in narrative tone parallels, and helps stage, the ontological rep etition of characters and events in his texts.9 Through this use of radical free indirect discourse, consciousness itself is relentlessly ventriloquized or echoed, and located outside individual identity: some narrator absorbs, du plicates, and disperses the voices of characters s/he is discussing and, in so doing, decenters notions of self-contained subjectivity and linear time. The narrator becomes the singular repository of consciousness, creating difference by disingenuously "displacing" the same voice or event in time, both forward and backward. Cohn calls a more familiar version of this process, after Leo Spitzer, "stylistic contagion," whereby a narrator mixes a character's interior monologue with its own reportorial technique or overarching voice.10 Pynchon's technique is often reminiscent of what Hugh Kenner calls the Uncle Charles principle in Joyce, in which charac ters' worldviews and limitations modulate the narrator's depiction of them.11 But in Pynchon that process is not confined to a narrator's unilat eral absorption of a single character's subjectivity; instead, utterances and identities are transmitted through a kind of consciousness virus, not just within disparate parts of the same text, but across texts and ontological categories. Pynchon's writing thereby also generates a radical transitivity between animate and inanimate beings, and world and (what used to be) self.</page><page sequence="5">N ARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 95 The resulting repetitions reflect both the cause and the effect of the radical triangulation and permeability of consciousness in Pynchon's works. Because Pynchon consistently dramatizes a transcendental, hylo zoic, or Neoplatonic belief in some form of universal consciousness, his works typically invoke some form of universal narration. If everything in the universe, including all its forces and objects, possesses some form of (inter)subjectivity, it also possess some kind of voice; as a result, narration itself is destabilized, and we can no longer differentiate the sources of rep resentation. As the boundaries between narrators and narrated, the ani mate and inanimate, and all forms of consciousness disintegrate, Pynchon's narratology sometimes supplants the very idea of character. But here ATD is, not surprisingly, already anomalous in the history of the novel. Cohn suggests that generally, a "narrator's superior knowledge of the character's inner life and his superior ability to present and assess it... . is implied in all psycho-narration, even where there is [great] cohe sion between the narrating and the figural consciousness.... one [dimen sion] leadfs] to the exploration of psychic depth, the other to the assessment of ethical worth."12 It is not clear whether Pynchon's narrator offers either advantage; while we gain insight into some characters' inner cognition, it is sporadic, inconsistent, and possibly unreliable, and even some major characters remain explicitly opaque. Either the narrator periodically lacks access to or interest in these characters (as happens perhaps most emblem atically with the Chums) or prefers to keep his omniscience or perceptions hidden. Something must fill the void created when human consciousness is so radically evacuated. Even outside ATD, Pynchon's narrators instead provide an unusual degree of access to the spaces between characters, to dimensions, systems, or forces that can attain their own identities or even subjectivities. Some would consider the attribution of will to such forces an instance not just of narrative pathetic fallacy but reification, but Pyn chon implies that the real Re(e)ification might involve the attribution of temporally self-contained consciousness to individual human personali ties. Instead, Pynchon seems to propose that consciousness (and finally time) is most accurately represented by repetition across once-imperme able borders; his works track the structural contexts for behaviors, traits, feelings, and thoughts that, as it were, traverse characters, spaces, and times. At this point, I want further to explain my section title. As I believe ATD invites us to, I associate free indirect radicals with free indirect speech, through which narrators "take on" the interiority of their subjects. Narrative style is a political act in Pynchon, for it involves the control,</page><page sequence="6">96 RICHARD HARDACK impersonation, mixing, and repetition of voices and identities. In Pyn chon, the chemical is also the political; think, for example, of the benzene ring in GR, capturing identity and voice by using a kind of violent ven triloquism, doubling, or usurpation. However, in at least one respect, free indirect discourse differs in being bidirectional; it also represents a form of noncovalent or ionic bonding/bondage. Who is telling the story of ATD? A narrator who knows the future and alludes to it intermittently but consistently; and one who is literally shifty, and malleable in tone and perspective. Using free indirect speech, the nar rator frequently takes on the voice of whoever's story s/he's telling: most notably, the narrator refers to the other (far from, yet literally) ob-scene adventures and books of the Chums of Chance, yet rarely if ever alludes to those endeavors when the Chums aren't the focus of the section.13 The narrator in some ways then simply becomes less Chummy. By contrast, the narrator's voice generally becomes less adolescent and more prurient when, for example, describing Yashmeen. The narrator thereby becomes a kind of atemporal or indirect double for the characters, so they are al ways already doubled in being described. Such narration would genu inely "have powers of second sight," but should also immediately raise suspicion (ATD, 140). Characters' consciousnesses, and the genres to which they belong, thus warp the narrative, and ultimately space-time itself, to their concerns. Narrative probably cannot even exist without such warping. Subjectivity in ATD acts like gravity on light, in more ways than one. If the narrator bends consciousness to its will, it is also rather bent by it. To what kind of accountability or countability can we hold this narra tor of ATD; how does it know what it knows? The narrator is like an impersonal force, a sponge absorbing all things, but is it actually neutral as well as neutered? Is there anyone there beyond/before the personalities it ventriloquizes while narrating? Can we identify the narrator as a "tradi tional" human consciousness? Does the text represent some balance be tween the consciousness of the narrator(s) and the characters, perpetually competing with, distorting, and undoing one another? It would be diffi cult to chart consistent principles, since the narrator often refers to subjec tivities across sections, and those references only sometimes apply to the characters, or at least scenarios and semes, the narrator is already depict ing. In other words, we might have disparate narrators for different sections with different agendas, insights, and limitations. The Chums' narrator might have less (or no) access to or interest in events occurring, for example, in Central Asia, which might be the province of another nar rator or narrative principle.</page><page sequence="7">N ARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 97 PRETERITION AND PREINCARNATION: NARRATOLOGY AND PYNCHON'S LIVING UNIVERSE Perhaps creatures live with us which we never see, cause their motion is too swift for our vision. —Ralph Waldo Emerson, "The Natural History of Intellect"14 They are all the presences we are not supposed to be seeing—wind gods, hilltop gods, sunset gods—that we train ourselves away from to keep from looking fur ther. . . . Suddenly, Pan—leaping—too beautiful to bear, beautiful Serpent, its coils in rainbow lashings in the sky— —Gravity's Rainbow (720—21) Pynchon's preterite are of course not only those who have been passed over, but those who are past. The new preterite in ATD are perhaps those who are not only out of time, but doubled—those we might call the prein carnated, or copies without originals. They are precursors to others as well as themselves, and never fully arrive. These narrative doubles and over laps complicate consciousness itself, which in Pynchon is rarely restricted to its traditional repositories. Perhaps the best way to characterize this Pynchonian sensibility with regard not just to the animate world, but nar ratology, is through American transcendentalism. Gravity's rainbow is also Pan's. Pynchon is transcendental in numerous contexts, but most of all through his ascription of will and sentience to the world. In a related form of doubling, transcendental or invisible forces speak through us; it is not only that time goes backward in ATD—all relations and assumptions about everything external to human consciousness can and must some times (half the time?) be inverted or turned around.15 For example, in stead of you having an hallucination, "'perhaps,' one beaming Oriental suggested, 'it was hallucinating you'" (37). In other words, instead of our existing and having a narrator, perhaps the narrator was having us. Throughout Pynchon's narrative, external forces possess us, and even be come characters (and not just inanimate objects, like Byron the burnt-out Bulb). In "Pan in America," D. H. Lawrence explicates the precepts of such transitive subjectivity: "I am even conscious that shivers of energy cross my living plasm, from the tree, and I become a degree more like unto the tree, more bristling and turpentiney, in Pan. And the tree gets a certain</page><page sequence="8">98 RICHARD HARDACK shade and alertness of my life."16 With "pantheistic sensuality," Lawrence insists that a tree is not "merely so much lumber not yet sawn," but a being with "its own assertive existence." (So is Slothrop—whose "family actu ally made its money killing trees"—"treed at last!" when he becomes "in tensely alert to trees, finally. When he comes in among trees he will spend time touching them . . . and understanding that each tree is a creature, carrying on its individual life, aware of what's happening around it, not just some hunk of wood to be cut down.... The trees are still. They know he's there" [GR, 199, 552-53].) This is also a definition of a kind of arboreal indirect libre, and finally of the way the world vocalizes and narrates. In ATD, Merle feels a "secret imperative, like the force of gravity, from all the silver he'd been develop ing out into the pictures he'd been taking over these years—as if silver were alive, with a soul and a voice, and he'd been working for it as much as it for him" (80).17 (One might be tempted to treat such assertions as exam ples, in Marxian terms, of commodity fetishism—especially where silver is involved—if so many of Pynchon's characters didn't routinely attribute souls and voices to inanimate objects of all kinds.) Cyprian tries to explain to Ratty, "if the earth were alive, with a planet-shaped consciousness," that the Balkans would represent a death wish—less a contingency than a prediction since such questions usually receive an affirmative answer in Pynchon's works (939). Pynchon's "conditionals" are often prophecies or temporal displacements. (They also offer additional examples of literal ized or identitarian tropes.) Pynchon's characters generally live in a pan theistic universe where the wind is trying to wake them up and the world is full of signs and, by implication, has consciousness and might even be a narrator (75). We might call this a form of transcendental narration, which dramatizes Emerson's claims that "the universe [is] alive," and that "each person is only a piece of the universe made alive," a way for the universe to see and narrativize itself.18 As Charles Amryc writes around the period when ATD begins, in Pantheism: The Light and Hope of Modern Reason, "Pantheism alone opens up a vista of endless reappearances .. . [man] be coming part of more and more complex phases of Pantheos, realizing and consciofying (rendering conscious) more and more of the world's forces."19 We might add narrativizing to this list of transcendental gerunds. An animate world is the bedrock of Pynchon's ontology and epistemol ogy. Precepts of narratology are defamiliarized under such conditions be cause consciousness is decentered from even anthropomorphic or tellurian constraints. Lawrence also warns that in the new world we might not en counter "the pantheism we are accustomed to, which expresses itself as 'God is everywhere, God is in everything.' In the oldest religion, every</page><page sequence="9">NARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 99 thing was alive.... So rocks were alive, but a mountain had a deeper, vaster life than a rock."20 Lawrence procures these images from the tran scendentalists who developed them from pre-Western sources: to give a few illustrative examples, in his 1872 essay "Transcendentalism," Cyrus Bartol asks whether "the soul [is] reared on primitive rock? or is no rock primitive, but the deposit of spirit, therefore in its lowest form alive, and ever rising into organism."21 As the Emersonian Babbalanja declaims in Melville's transcendental pastiche Mardi, "I live while consciousness is not mine, while to all appearances I am a clod. And may not this same state of being, though but alternate with me, be continually that of many dumb, passive objects we so carelessly regard? .. . Think you there is no sensa tion in being a rock?"22 According to John Fiske, in his 1885 address to the Concord School of Philosophy, everything is animated by this universal but impersonal vitality: "[T]he universe as a whole is thrilling in every fi bre with Life,—not, indeed, life in the usual restricted sense, but life in a general sense. The distinction, once deemed absolute, between the living and the not-living is converted into a relative distinction."23 To Emerson, "Nature is the incarnation of a thought, and turns to a thought again, as ice becomes water and gas... . Man crystallized, man vegetative, speaks to man impersonated" ("Nature," 3:196). It is likely that Pynchon's crystallized narrators are also incarnating and impersonating the nonhuman as well as human world, and that they have attained poly morphous subjectivity. To complete the circle, Emerson also repeatedly avers that "the world becomes, at last, only a realized will—the double of the man" ("Nature," 1:40). If the world "realizes," voices, and doubles men, Pynchon's narrators could hardly be expected to do less, and they reflect this transcendental double consciousness connecting observer and observed: the world speaks through us, and we are always being not only "narrated," but ventriloquized. In his dated but thorough study of primitivism in Melville, James Baird provides a useful definition of animism in the American Renaissance that also applies to Pynchon: animism is the mind's "attribution of its own sen tient life and intelligence to all things. ... when we revert to primitive conditions of mind, the earth and all nature is alive and intelligent."24 Sen tient Rocksters unite: you have nothing to lose but your senselessness. (Perhaps following Hegel or "Doctor Livingstone (living stone? oh, yes)," those Rocksters are the group in GR who believe in a "mineral conscious ness not too much different from plants and animals, except for the time scale" [612,587].) Pynchon rocks most consistently in GR and ATD, though he animates not just transcendental nature, but the transcendental tech nologies and forces that supplant it. Echoing much of GR, Pynchon writes</page><page sequence="10">100 RICHARD HARDACK in ATD, for example, that "the steel webwork was a living organism"; we later learn that, from a high enough altitude, the "great project [of the Trans-Siberian Railroad] appears almost like a living organism" (177, 259). The twin crystals of Iceland spar are repeatedly depicted "as if there were a soul harbored within" (391). In ATD, even "the egg yolk [can be] perhaps regarded as a conscious entity" (545). Most frequently, we're re minded that consciousness, and perhaps narrative consciousness, can't be confined to people: we are told, for example, "the wind was alive" (656); "the currents and wind, were a composite being with intentions of its own" (818); everything from "th &amp; journey itself is a kind of conscious Be ing," to the "wind, which was alive, conscious" (765, 773). All such entities have the potential to become narrative subjectivities. Dally is even de scribed "as if her appearance possessed a consciousness," accentuating the doppelganger effect (898). Such pronouncements are part of Pynchon's larger transcendental, and specifically pantheistic, worldview, which animates the inanimate, tends to sentimental surrealism, and, as suggested, often literalizes metaphor. In Pynchon's Vineland, the now more ominous "Central Power itself. . . [was] somehow personally aware, possessing life and will."25 In ATD, Merle's pictures capture such psychic forces, and double them as negatives. As in GR, the world is alive and accumulates psychic energy, and rocks have souls. In other words, we must also ask when, why, and how Pynchon's narrators have access to nonhuman consciousness; is there any guilt or transference by association? This narrativization of nonhuman subjectiv ity is also connected to the doubling in Pynchon's texts. These animated shadow worlds serve as a kind of political unconscious, negative, abreac tion, or counter-narrative for each "surface" text and consciousness. Nar ration is, of course, a manifestation of Central Power itself. Pynchon's narrator in ATD sometimes knows not just the thoughts of stones, but those that haven't yet occurred. In ATD, Pynchon's form of re petitive narration situates time as not only relative and nonlinear, but non singular and possibly impossible as a category: for example, "questions arose as to the timing, the 'simultaneousness' of [the Siberian event].... which had not quite happened yet.. . [and] only seemed to occur in the present, though really originating in the future. [Was it] the general war ... collapsed into a single event?" (797). Just as continents mass and converge, so do temporal nodes. The simultaneity of events is also a func tion of bifurcated consciousness, a "bi-product" of narrators who can be two places at once: "Communication had commenced, while, almost ex actly on the other side of the Earth, Chums of Chance monitoring person nel waited... . was the signal going around the planet, or through it, or</page><page sequence="11">NARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 101 was the linear progression not at all the point, with everything instead happening simultaneously at every part of the circuit?" (112). Throughout ATD, the narrator acts and events transpire "as if time had been removed from all equations" and everything "already existed in the moment, com plete, perfected" (327). In Emersonian terms, everything happens all at once and has also already happened. The event is always only an echo be tween past and future, or between one (part of a) text and another: it exists only in the relay and repetition, and therefore necessarily creates parallels/ doubles. Now, because it is singular and isolated, might be the only time that cannot exist in Pynchon's texts. As Werfner begins, there might be inescapable symmetries, some "predisposition to the echoic," as Renfrew ironically finishes, "perhaps built into the nature of Time" (227). Not sur prisingly, these are conceits Pynchon repeatedly dramatizes intratextually and intertextually. \nATD, for example, "a curious thing had happened to time" (876); or as Superman opines in GR, "[Y]ou know, Jimmy, time— time is a funny thing" (752). In Pynchon, time travel functions as a Borgesian form of illimitable intersubjectivity and intertextuality: passages and characters from one work show up in "earlier" and "later" works, but then all texts intertwine as one undifferentiated and nonlinear text (which is the encyclopedic uni verse). Ultimately, however, my argument is that Pynchon's treatment of time is political, and at the heart of his radicalism: "What are any of these 'utopian dreams' of ours but defective forms of time-travel ?" (942). Time travel and the right kind of doubling might help us escape the wrong kind of narrative forces, but escape from repetition is set up as a Utopian fantasy that perhaps only balloon boys can realize. The echoes or symmetries found throughout ATD—from the explicit adumbration of the Sentient Rocksters from GR (133) to the Traverses and Beckers from Vineland—suggest a paranoid fatalism some of Pyn chon's characters frantically seek to evade (for example, when Slothrop, perhaps to avoid representation and repetition, disappears from "narra tive" and individual identity altogether and becomes a collective, mythi cal, or dispersed entity).26 When characters across pages, chapters, and even texts echo one another, it also suggests a slow collapse into a single, or at least connected, form of consciousness. Sometimes Pynchon's narrative use of this free indirect speech is so obvious, and so directed to temporal/ historical disjunction, as to be parodic: for example, the narrator of ATD tells us of a "maze of islands that so confounded the Argonauts even be fore history began"; on the next page, Vlado tells Yashmeen of narratives "sometimes even older than the Argonauts' expedition—before history" (818—19). Here the character is either picking up the narrator's voice di</page><page sequence="12">102 RICHARD HARDACK rectly or the narrator is adumbrating or manipulating the character's speech: as often happens in Pynchon, cause and effect, before and after, launch and echo, are unstable, and even alterations seem to confirm un derlying identity and connection, not difference.27 The narrator here again destabilizes linear sequence, because the text has no objective or immuta ble past and future, and many things transpire simultaneously or out of "order." Sometimes the echoes are not just intratextual or intertextual, but more traditionally literary, but even in that context, they arrive explicitly doubled.28 As Mark Quinn notes, we are cited the same passage from Dante twice 'mATD: Chick reads "I am the way into the doleful city— Dante," above a memorial arch (401), which is an iteration of the phrase set above a great Portal of the City (154).29 Such repetitions transpire be cause "Time itself was disrupted, a thoroughgoing and merciless for swearing of Time as we had known it" (148). REPETITIVE I STRAIN, OR INVISIBLE DOUBLES These Oneirine hauntings show a definite narrative continuity, as clearly as, say, the average Reader's Di gest article. —Gravity's Rainbow (703) Some of Pynchon's narrative repetitions could of course reflect mere coin cidence, authorial laziness, or stylistic proclivities—in other words, some times a repetition is just a repetition. And Pynchon is so densely allusive one risks overreading what could be the product of his informal prose— that is, the seemingly careless sprawl of his work is bound to contain ac cidental recitations. But Pynchon is so doggedly attuned to the meanings of repetition in language—emblematized, for example, by Dwight Ed dins's suggestion that even the name Vheissu in V. conveys the idea that "V. is you" (Gnostic Pynchon, 65)—that the greater peril is to miss the larger double meanings. Say something once, it falls on deaf ears; say something twice, and the reader must respond. In that light, the degree and quality of repetition in Pynchon's work, and ATD especially, seem critically important. What I earlier introduced as a form of viral con sciousness results in a kind of "repetitive I strain," a fragmented, yet connected, consciousness that suffuses Pynchon's work and produces un paralleled parallels and repetitions among characters, texts, times, and taxonomies. We might also call this phenomenon in Pynchon consciousness without borders.</page><page sequence="13">NARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 103 How does this decentered narratology manifest itself in ATD? Some times the narrator seems to have "tells" or quirks of his/her own; after in troducing "fish known locally as 'sea swallows,"' the narrator a few pages later invokes "a narrow canal known locally as 'the chains'" (826). For a random, brief moment, the narrator is interested in narrativizing aquatic nomenclature on a local scale. Other repetitions function as merely formal echoes: Dally mentions "[t]hat Krakatoa" (506), and fifty pages later Thorn emblematically conjures a time machine to go to Krakatoa (554). And some repetitions might not be the narrator's at all. Lorelei, for example, asks whether Yashmeen is "content with vegetable love" a few pages be fore Yashmeen asks the grand Cohen if he wants her "to try and be reborn as a vegetable," and a few pages before we hear of "a number of similar vegetable jokes" (494, 500, 504). Much later, Noellyn asks Yashmeen if she ever saw "that old vegetable [Cyprian] again" (803). Such echoes are of course not surprising if characters, as seems likely here, are simply repris ing stock phrases, such as the epithet of vegetable attached to Cyprian. But, more often, disconnected characters and the narrator perform the exchanges in ways that seem designed to be unrealistic. The narrator might not be reporting these connections, but orchestrating or creating them. In other words, while we know that "authors" are never equal to narrators, what happens when narrators become authors? Hunter, for ex ample, says, "It never does that" (referring to a canal turning blue), and a few pages later Humfried iterates, "Even in Russia this never occurs" (referring to Yashmeen's appearance at their swamp, serene as a swan) (584, 588); Gunther makes "repeated consultations with the Prussian du eling bible," and soon after Lew makes a "consultation in Kelly's Subur ban Dictionary" (600, 609). Are all these repetitions being mediated by the narrator, so that characters' voices are being subtly aligned with one another? Such a prospect seems plausible because at least some of these "varia tions," repetitions with slight alterations, occur more dramatically across space and time: Swome tells Kit, "[Y]ou don't suffer from 'nerves', I hope," and in the next section Gunther asks Kit, "How could anyone's nerves here remain unafflicted?" (630, 633). But here, it is not only the narrator who is picking up voicings from characters. Rather, it as though characters across sections, in different times and places, and even among texts, are also continuing conversations, and mere echoes come to reflect more sinis ter, if finally unidentified, forces. The plot of AID, such as it is, is struc tured through an incessant evolution of such forms/narratives/voices whose prior existence is never fully erased; narrative time is therefore a form of haunting.</page><page sequence="14">104 RICHARD HARDACK Sometimes free indirect speech works in reverse and characters imme diately pick up language from the narrator: right after we learn Renfrew and Werfner are the same person, another twin or double, the narrator advises, "Take his money and call him Knucklehead. So it was as simple as that" (685). Two pages later Lew adds, "| Simplifies things in a way." But a hundred pages earlier, Dally had told Hunter, "[Simplifies life, up to a point anyway," indicating phrases can travel long "distances" (576). Pynchon also uses what we might term transitive narration throughout ATD, where one character continues another's (or the narrator's) thoughts in separate circumstances: for instance, a few pages after Kit sees the de spair in Fleetwood's face, and the narrator asks, "[W]hat life could he ex pect as one more murderer with his money in Randshares ... ?" (791), Padzhitnoff asks Randolph, whose name is also an iteration or share of Randshares, "What do you think of Rand shares?" (795). These repetitions are unsettling because they suggest that invisible forces, or hidden connections, control not just narrative, but even our syn tax. These are not traditional thematic echoes, but impossible intersections of consciousness. The narrator most of all engages in such temporal and figurative ventriloquism, becoming, appropriately for the text, a time ma chine moving backward and forward, for example here staging multiple mergers with the mobility: the narrator tells us that Theign discovers that "immersion in the Italian mobility comforted him" (708); Cyprian soon after is similarly described as seeking "to be absorbed somehow into a mo bility" (715); and finally Reef, again emblematically completing the se quence, is "soon absorbed into a mobility of hundreds of separate futures" (746). Perhaps characters can know where or when they are, but not both, and are consequently split between those vectors. Sometimes the narrator seems to transpose thoughts or words of the characters: right after Lake tells her absent mother "you do your best to wreck us, and then you run away ... behind the wall of death," the narra tor tells us "and then one day . . . Deuce came riding back into Wall o' Death" (481). (Here, the narrator provides an internal stylistic echo, al most zeugmatically linking the town to the carnival ride it is named after, but the echo also suggests a kind of translation that operates more univer sally and crosses all borders and boundaries.) And sometimes the narrator simply seems to want to tell us what he knows, as when he informs us— using photo bilocation to close the text's penultimate section, "Against the Day"—that Dally was "riding out to a stop in some banlieue"-, begins "Ru Du Depart" by describing Dally as humming "C'est pas Paris, c'esa sa banlieueand then on the next page tells us that Dally had drifted "into its, well, banlieue" (1061, 1064-65). Even here we might notice a slippage:</page><page sequence="15">NARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 105 the second time you say something, it means something slightly different from the first, especially if it's a direct repetition. The double is trans formed. Repetition confirms identity, but identity slightly altered. In that quondam fissure, as I later argue, is finally where any revolutionary hope might lie. Most ofATD's forms of narrative bleed reify simultaneities or invisible connections. As one of the most prominent examples, the text's narrator repeatedly uses variations on a single phrase, such as "who, but," to de scribe how characters perpetually run into one another across the globe in emphatically unbelievable fashion: "The moving field came to rest at length on whom but the co-tenant of Tarot card XV, Professor P. Jotham Renfrew" (679); "[W]ho should appear but the Grand, soon to be Associ ate, Cohen" (687); "[W]hom should he run into but old Ratty McHugh" (700). Chance purportedly produces stock cliches of temporal overlay, but unlikely reappearances reflect far more than coincidence. Versions of the line "And wouldn't you know it, who should Cyprian run into that eve ning, acting just about that desperate, but his onetime antagonists Misha and Grisha"—or "Frank was in a bar on Seventeenth Street one night when who should he run into but"; Frank had "just stepped outside to piss when who should he catch sight of but"; Chick stood in line at the hot dog stand, "where who should he run into but his father"; "one day climbing down out of Renzo's Caproni who should reappear from the olden day but Kit's old classmate Colfax Vibe"; and, in return, formulations of "who'd they happen to run into but Frank"—recur over a hundred times in the work, along with dozens of evocations of chance and coincidence (829, 849, 890,932, 995, 1013, 1034, 1073, 1075). Of course, the book begins with an exposition of such chance encounters, beginning with the Chums of Chance, but moves to "the gods of Chance," later referred to as "the laws of chance" (528, 987). Through synchronicity and simultaneity, such chance becomes predetermined connection; the repetition of such prepos terous encounters makes all coincidence exigent. But the text as a whole also speeds up as it concludes; as it jumps ahead more quickly, it leaves more gaps. As part of that same process, such patently artificial and in credible coincidences occur with increasing frequency and ferocity toward the end of the book. Because time is decentered, recognition and precogni tion become blurred. On the one hand, the move to predetermined "chance," to inevitable doubling and repetition, suggests oppressive forces of consolidation are winning; but on the other hand, we also move toward a future grace we have not quite seen in Pynchon before.30 These coincidences and reappearances remain closely related to time and time travel; they are narratological—and what I later define as out</page><page sequence="16">106 RICHARD HARDACK ward and visible—dramatizations of Merle's film/photos that speed up time between events and project lives forward. Dally, for example, is last seen at a cafe in Paris, where "she'd discovered that if she only sat at a table outside, before long her life, selections from her life, would repeat them selves in slightly different form, featuring exactly the people she 'needed' to see again" (1067). Doubling becomes a form of repetition compulsion. Who but these people could Dally see? The unlikelihood of meeting them is superseded only by its inevitability. Such phrasings partly enact Pynchon's transcendental conceit, in ATD and most of his works, that all events occur simultaneously, that they all form part of the same grid or network, and finally that all people might be the same person. Through these "strange links," everything in ATD began "happening simultaneously" on opposite sides of the world (112). Every speech is then made '"here ... but also simultaneously'. .. | through] the mysterious shamanic power known as bilocation" (143). We are told through "the little-understood enigmata of the simultaneous .. . their gunners were abolishing time," a conceit perfectly adapted to the artificial temporalities of narrative (256). In this doubling and eradication of time, bilocation, or the ability to be in two places at once, conjoins any two events or figures slightly displaced in narrative sequence (143). As we began to inhabit a postmodern world where, as David Harvey notes, "two events in quite different spaces occurring at the same time could so intersect as to change how the world worked," Pynchon's representation of bilocality or ubiquity rewrites the modernist imperative "only [to] connect" as "only to bilocate."31 This iterated notion of bilocality is cathected both to things that haven't happened yet and to thoughts to which we could have no ac cess, not because they're private, but because they're inaccessible even to the characters. As noted, but here addressed in terms of subjectivity, the text's "narra tive bilocality" sometimes jumps only "across" a local paragraph to other parts of the same conversation or scene. After the narrator tells us it was as if Yashmeen's father had read his daughter's mind, Auberon says, "And there was Umeki," and the narrator in the next paragraph states, "and there was Kit Traverse," as though to acknowledge his own need to imi tate, usurp, or affirm the prior declaration (974). (The narrator is not just being a kind of ontologically alliterative writer here, but also emblemati cally co-opting characters' perceptions.) Proximity of repetition among pages, however, does not necessarily reflect proximity between minds: right after Flaco, out with Reef, says, "Maybe he should have known bet ter," Yashmeen wonders in the next separated paragraph, "Should I know better?" (852). No connection between these scenes exists except for the</page><page sequence="17">NARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 107 narrator, or perhaps "invisible gateways" (853). But sometimes the narra tor insinuates something more sinister, for example, that "(Miles's spoken feelings, though recorded, were not readily made sense of)" (1031). Who is recording what and how? What recording angel hovers with a stenograph? How are these feelings made sense of normally? It is easy to overlook such passages, but they disrupt traditional narrative conventions of voice and subjectivity. Despite an occasional lapse into decorum, the narrator of ATD often shows little reluctance to intrude on privacy. In GR, the empathic narrator comes across as an ally against doubling and counterforces: "[I]f the Counterforce knew better what those catego ries concealed, they might be in a better position to disarm, de-penis, and dismantle the Man. But they don't. Actually, they do, but they don't admit it. Sad, but true" (712). We can't necessarily identify the speaker who gives us this self-canceling counter-narration, but we likely situate him/her as being on our side. But the narrator of ATD is harder to delimit because s/he seems more of a participant than observer. As intimated, that narrator sometimes seems to want to jar us with his or her intrusiveness, an ability to displace characters' consciousnesses. ATD's omniscient narrator is even able to tell us, for example, that "Stray had put the cigarettes under the rolled-up shirt [Frank] was using for a pillow to keep them safe, which seemed such a tender thought he wished he'd been awake for it" (921). As part of several paradoxes—or perhaps instances of ontological rubber necking—the narrator takes over and completes the character's interior life for him. One has to wonder what characters who are notoriously par anoid about invisible forces would think of such narrators, and "forces which had never seen reason to declare themselves" (887). However, the narrator usually connects two places/characters through more generic structural echo (rather than such telepathy that goes beyond even omni science and becomes participatory): "We're going to stop and surprise the girls," said Rocco. / "If they don't surprise us," responded Pino (547). On the next page, in the next chapter, Randolph uses the same structural/syn tactic reversal: "Bound to run into a few we know." / "Sure, but will they know us?" replied Chick (548). Yet in one sense there is no echo, because all such scenes in the text are bilocal, happening at the same time. Are these nonechoes a reflection of the characters' wills—their use of simple repetition—or the narrator's? With another author who provided fewer examples, such repetition might seem accidental or largely formal, but in Pynchon it becomes an "independent" force of the text. The apotheosis of such psycho-narrative collapse occurs when we learn that the seeming antagonists "Renfrew and Werfner were one and the same person," a revelation that echoes many of Pynchon's earlier works: as</page><page sequence="18">108 RICHARD HARDACK happens throughout the text, they "somehow had the paranormal power to be in at least two places at the same time ... known in the Psychical field for about fifty years as 'bilocation'" (685—86). Renfrew and Werfner's very names are of course simply inversions, one moving "forward" in time and the other "backward." Playing with textual bilocation, Pynchon also peri odically modulates Melville's depiction of Moby Dick—the first bilocated American icon, which is repeatedly designated as "ubiquitous" and seem ingly "had been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same in stant of time" (182)—for example, in describing a tornado that "is always indisputably always the same tornado," the whirlwind of "Eternal Re turn" (452—53). In a lesser variation of the same principle, Dally imagines the Princess "to be everywhere ... could swear her appearances were mul tiple and not consecutive" (583). Such "reduction" to ubiquity is counter part to an expansion through doubling. Through such descriptions, time and space are reduced to a single point, much as the war is compressed to a single event. Counterparts, bilocated doubles and negatives, photo graphic and otherwise, create a world of temporal parallels that ultimately (re)merge: "[T]hey lived for different futures, but they were each other's unrecognized halves" (70). Early on, in conjunction with "an asymmetry with respect to light anyway," Merle realizes "Professor Edward Morley and Charles 'Blinky' Morgan were one and the same person \ Separated by a couple-three letters in name as if alphabetically double-refracted" (62). Light and narrative bend and refract us into positive and negative, but more radically also suggest that we don't exist except through such dual ity: there was never a single, original "nonnarrated" self that was then doubled or refracted. But, paradoxically, there is never a multiple that isn't also everywhere always one and the same. Establishing that aesthetic and hermeneutic precept in the American idiom, Emerson asserts, for example, that he is "much struck in literature by the appearance that one person wrote all the booths; there is such equality and identity both of judgment and point of view in the narrative, that it is plainly the work of one all-seeing, all hearing gentleman" ("Nominalist and Realist," in Worlds [see note 14], 3:233). One all-seeing, all-hearing gentleman, or demiurge, also seems to be at work in ATD. As if he were that one gentleman, Emerson frequently iterates that he feels "as if one man wrote all the boo^s. ... It was the same mind that built the world" ("The Celebration of Intellect," in Worlds [see note 14], 12:122). William Ellery Channing wrote that transcendentalists profess "that there is one being, one mind, one person, one intelligent agent, and one only, to whom underived and infinite perfections and dominion belong."32 In the dra matically ironic "History," Emerson adds, "There is one mind common to</page><page sequence="19">NARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 109 all individual men.... Who hath access to this universal mind is a party to all that is or can be done, for this is the only and sovereign agent" (in Works [see note 14], 2:3). Here is precisely the problem for Pynchon's charac ters—who is the sovereign agent in these narratives? In a trope developed from both Neoplatonism and Elizabethan trag edy, recurring nearly verbatim in the transcendental writings of Emerson, Melville, Whitman, Borges, Philip K. Dick, and Pynchon, all men who say the same thing become the same person, variations of the universal mind. Pynchon is wildly dialogic in his use of free indirect speech, yet proposes that all men who say the same thing are the same man and that history entails the eternal return of the same voices. Transcendental American writers embrace most of these assumptions, most often voiced in the idea of a kind of national choir. In "Song of Myself," Whitman con tends, "These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me."33 Under pantheism, universality supplants orig inality, and all men at all times breathe the same recirculated air and think the same transpersonal, or perhaps collectively narrativized, thoughts. For Pynchon, the monomania of such identity also foments an extraordinarily antinomian paranoia. After introducing "the rhythm of some traditional American tune" in GR, Pynchon recounts several deranged visions of such idealized, "transcendental" repetition: Not ' archetypal" westwardman, but the only. Understand, there was only one. There was only one Indian who ever fought him. ... one president, and one assassin, and one election. One of each of everything. You had thought of solipsism, and imagined the structure to be populated—on your level—-by only, terribly, one. . . . But it proves to be not quite that lonely. . . . Half an ark's better than none. (67)34 In Pynchon, all such ones and zeros, binaries, doubles, and reductions are also terribly one. We can also trace the way literature comes to coincide with iteration in the continuity of Emerson's, Borges's, and Pynchon's transcendental views of identity. In "Pantheism and Personality," Ana Maria Barrenechea re minds us that Borges includes this revealing passage in his prologue to Emerson's Representative Men: "Our destiny is tragic because we are, ir reparably, individuals restrained by time and space; consequently, there is nothing more agreeable than a faith which eliminates circumstances and declares that every man is all men and that there is no one who is not the universe."35 In Borges's work, his (often unreliable) narrators suggest that</page><page sequence="20">110 RICHARD HARDACK men are incomplete versions of platonic archetypes, and vessels for an all encompassing divinity: as we learn in "Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius," "This happy conjecture that there is only one subject, that this indivisible subject is every being in the universe, and that these beings are the organs and masks of the divinity. . . . [such is] the complete victory of this idealist pan theism."36 We should reassess Pynchon's doubles in light of this one person who narrates or sings everything. Pynchon frequently merges not only his characters' (and possibly narrators') perspectives, but identities: for exam ple, before/after Werfner and Renfrew, in GR "the two children, Gott fried and Bianca, are the same" (762). This form of paranoia frequently produces a complete breakdown of the self: How many chances does one get to be a synthesis, Points man? East and West, together in the same bloke? ... Pro tagonist and antagonist in one. . . . Pointsman is about to retort something like, "But you're not me," ... "Oh ha ha" he sez instead. Talking to myself here. ... whispers the Voice, "Yang and Yin." (278) Pynchon sometimes figures this quest for primal unity in non-Western cultures as a desire to reintegrate the self or community with god, and in the West as a postcolonial return of the repressed manifested as pathol ogy.37 (Even this anomalous form of double consciousness often has a ra cial component in Pynchon, much as it does among the transcendentalists from whom Du Bois reappropriates the conceit.) But with Pointsman the synthesis is psychotic: later in GR we are told, "No, no,—you said, 'I say,' once, is what you—" A -ha\ But I said it again, \-said it. . . twice" . . [Y]ou can't tell me the two 'I say's were both part of the same statement,' unless ... we're the same person, and ... the whole exchange was ONE SINGLE THOUGHT yaaaggghhh." (634) In ATD, saying it twice seems to be part of an empirical reality. For every Pynchon character such as Renfrew/Werfner who turns out to be a dou ble, there is a Pointsman or Mucho who becomes schizophrenic or qua drophenic, or loses all sense of boundary to the self.38 While one can differentiate these types, they all reflect some variation of doubling/merg ing, which is usually explained after the fact; we rarely start out under</page><page sequence="21">N ARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 111 standing that two people or events are identical, so part of the narrative process itself involves the gradual disclosure of these patterns of repetition. In that reductive sense, the sequential staging of preexisting simultaneity, or doubling, is indistinguishable from time. These equally solipsistic and doubled exchanges also emblematize tran scendental voicing in American literature. Whitman's song of inclusive ness and incorporation is restored to a dirge of Melvillean monomania in Pynchon. As Dwight Eddins observes, in the Crying of Lot 49 Mucho Maas, who also makes an appearance in Vineland (307—13), reduces the multiplicity of American voices to a single, enormous mass.39 (Adumbrat ing Werfner and Renfrew, Mucho's doubled initials, MM, also flip Whit man's, WW.) Mucho becomes one of Emerson's representative men when he concludes that "no matter who's talking, the different power spectra are the same." Just as all men who read Shakespeare are Shakespeare in Borges's "Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius," for Maas, "Everybody who says the same words is the same person. . .. But the time is arbitrary.. .. [T]hat way you can shuffle each person's time-line sideways till they all coincide ... and it would all be the same voice" (106).40 Though an extreme, drug-addled ex ample—who narcissistically believes all other voices are his echoes— Mucho represents a long-standing transcendental conceit of overlapping time, identity, and narration—that is, of narratology and ontology—that we might call the Muchismo of American culture. Referring to Mason &amp; Dixon, and of course to the line that book evokes, Samuel Thomas re marks, "The line, as an expression of Enlightenment, therefore imposes 'the arid wisdom of repetition,' an objectified principle of sameness" (24).41 Captain Zhang in that novel contends that "nothing will produce bad his tory more directly nor brutally than drawing a Line . . . through the midst of a People" (615). In ATD, we have to single up all those side-lines and time-lines. I take a brief sidewise step here myself because the "sideways" repre sents another crucial manifestation of doubling in Pynchon. Some repeti tions, such as his unusual use of the word sidewise in many novels, could just reflect Pynchon's syntactic idiosyncrasies (for example, when a boy puts on a "cap with its bill turned sidewise" [ATD, 107]). But for Pynchon's paranoid, "all is organized in spheres joyful or threatening about the cen tral pulse of himself.... The act of metaphor ... [Oedipa] slipped side wise, screeching back across grooves of years" (Lot 49, 95). The sidewise represents another calculated form of temporal dislocation. In what Pyn chon sometimes refers to as a "sidewise" motion, once distinct voices also overlap: "[T]he voices are identical" (Lot 49, 106; GR, 577). Pynchon uses the sidewise to map converging geographies and identities, what he also</page><page sequence="22">112 RICHARD HARDACK terms "moires" or overlapping solipsisms: . . the Paranoids. She couldn't tell them apart" (Lot 49, 23). Sometimes, especially among Pynchon's less reliable figures, characters do not join other distinct subjectivities; rather, multiple identities coalesce, "coming on like a whole roomful of people": "That's what I am, right. Everybody is," Mucho declares, "perhaps having had his vision of consensus as others do orgasms." For Mucho, "[S]he's any number of people, all over the world, back through time, different colors, shapes, distances from death, but she loves. And the 'you' is everybody," an everybody who will soon be now (106). These sidewise detours are the journey itself in Pynchon's works and return with renewed intensity mATD: "Let us imagine a lateral world, set only infinitesimally to the side of the one we know" (230). They lead to the possibility of a "lateral resurrection," a sidewise escape from, or fatal re turn to, the here and now (431). That "continuum lateral to ours"—"a Creation set just to the side of this one," revealed by a "double refrac tion"—is always side-wise (518, 566). Near the end ofATD, prompted by the photos that can "unfold" past or future history, Lew remembers bi location as these side trips and detours (1049—50). ATD is the final staging of this sidewise bilocation in Pynchon's works: "Maybe some of us are ready to step 'side-wise' once more, into the next dimension—into Time— our fate, our lord, our destroyer" (427). Time is not the only causal casualty in Pynchon's work. \nATD, repeti tion causes geography itself to meet the same fate, the same compression of coordinates, as the continents form "one great mass ... with Inner Asia at its heart," later "the heart of earth" (242, 786). Such zones are transcen dental, and—for reasons beyond the immediate scope of this essay—often Pacific/Asiatic.42 This animated world has a continuous shoreline, an of ten anthropomorphized body and a universal heart. This transcendental assertion of geographic universality is common to most of Pynchon's works: Lew, for example, "bet you could find this same structure of indus trial hells wrapped in public silence everyplace," much as Oedipa could "by that continuity ... f[i]nd The Tristero anywhere in her Republic" (ATD, 176; Lot 49, 135). As Oedipa fears, the tower, and everything else, is everywhere, part of "the American continuity of crust and man tle. ... There was the true continuity. San Narciso," much like Mucho, "had no boundaries" (Lot 49, 133—34). (In psychogeographic terms, there are no zones but the zone, and Remedios Varo's tapestry becomes the world: as we were already advised in V., "History's serpent is one: what matter where on her body we lie.")43 But invisible doubles soon emerge within that continental continuity, living laterally in "exile from some where else invisible yet congruent with the cheered land [Oedipa] lived</page><page sequence="23">NARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 113 in" (135). One version of the double in Pynchon's work long ago already represented the other, invisible America, its "secret history" (86). Partly because Pynchon sometimes writes like a literal structuralist, I need to double-back to the issue of doubling, though now itself doubled, or coupled with, the idea of invisibility. Invisible duality, or double con sciousness, cannot be dissociated from the narratology of American tran scendentalism and Emerson's foundational attempt to make himself disappear as the transparent eyeball who is nowhere but sees (and perhaps narrates) all: at the beginning of "Nature," Emerson proclaims that as he is bathed "by the blithe air" of nature, he is uplifted into infinite space: "[A]ll mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eyeball. I am noth ing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part and parcel of god" (1:9—11). (Hawthorne, in The Blithedale Ro mance, tracks some of the consequences of being such a narrative Pan opticon.) Such a description uncannily fits Pynchon's narrator in ATD, who is nowhere, and not only now here, and sees if not all, a good deal more than most. Doubling in ATD, however, turns out to be imperfect, which also has connotations for the narrator, who in some ways serves as the double for all the characters. Through Iceland spar, "not only had the entire scene doubled," it grew brighter and separated into two colors (306). Light re fracts or bifurcates; describing his disappearing act, Luca remarks, "Dou bles the image . .. and instead of two different pieces of one body, there are now two complete individuals walking around, who are identical in every way" (355). But it turns out this disappearance/invisibility creates a double whose halves can never be fully restored. (So does Dr. Rao also "[reappear]" after vanishing, "though curiously, not quite the same person he had been before performing the Asana" [539].) These variations sug gest either an escape from eternal return or an entropic form of degraded repetition. So might the Chums themselves have mutated "into imperfect replicas of who they once were . . . [who] would return again and again to the old performance sites ... to play the same medleys ... to sit at the same cafe tables, haunt the same s\eins of narrow streets ... unsure whether their own youth was behind them or yet to come" (422—23). Yet such doubling is imperfect because it splits the self in time; the two (at minimum) ver sions are as much the same as "Borges and I." We become not only like the slightly altered Traverse brothers Yashmeen encounters, but our own "aged doubles." In other words, Pynchon might be staging the transcen dental idea that, as Melville iterates in The Confidence Man, "the difference between this man and that man is not so great as the difference between what the same man be to-day and what he may be in days to come."44 Or</page><page sequence="24">114 RICHARD HARDACK as Slavoj Zizek contends, "IRjadical difference is the difference of the One with regard to itself, the noncoincidence of the one with itself."45 That divided half keeps de- and rematerializing mATD. ATD's obsession with "the Invisible, and a voice, or something like a voice," links doubling and invisibility with narration itself (99). Charac ters confront "a silence as daunting as their near invisibility," suggesting voice cannot be dissociated from material doubling (223). Sometimes cap italized, that Invisibility demarcates many of the characters: Lew, for ex ample, knew "what distinguished him was a keen sympathy for the invisible" (43). Evoking "the great but unseen gathering of skyships" near the book's close, the Chums' "motto was, 'there, but Invisible'" (1083). "There, but Invisible" should of course also be the narrator's motto, though he rarely highlights his own invisibility directly. The text indicates that invisibility is a form of complex encoding, a kind of narration itself: "[T] hey actually become invisible. Almost as if there were some ... additional level of encryption" (437). (Again, in Pynchon it is as though the meta phorical hypothetical must become a literal certainty.) Such encryption, which is the purview of T.W.I.T. (the True Worshippers of the Ineffable Tetractys), implies the spirit world is not only one of displacement, but ontological narratology (224). Throughout the text, invisibility remains connected to narration and subjectivity. Like their invisible narrator, char acters appear and reappear from nowhere: as we are told dozens of times, "[W|ho should reappear from the olden days but?" (1073). Perhaps a text or a narrator displaced in time. ATD is also full of invisible sentinels, or "invisible sphere[s] of force" (447); Calvinesque "invisible cit[ies] over the edge of the world" (735); "other planefs] of existence, close but just invisi ble" (610). The Koloni even constructed "on the principles of Invisibilism, a school of modern architecture which believed that the more 'rationally' a structure was designed, the less visible it would appear" (625). The same could be said of some forms of narrative scaffolding, but like architects, narrators also might want to be recognized for their interior work. \i\ATD, Pynchon focuses on the incipient technologies that allow us to capture, speed up, and control time and other invisibles, including aspects of photography, film, and travel. Merle's photo represents a kind of magi cal realist distillation of bilocation: "[W]e just dial in the year, date, and time of day we're interested in, it all speeds up, runs through the time be tween [when] the picture was taken and now in a matter of seconds" (1048). Roswell adds, "And not only can we unfold the future history of these subjects, we can also reverse the process, to look into their pasts" (1049). (Pynchon is also playing with the cheesy science-fiction motifs that structure the Chums of Chance narratives, but such parody does not en</page><page sequence="25">NARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 115 tirely detract from his relentless staging of these ideas.) This is also the way the book's narrative works. Dr. Rao early on "suggests] the possibil ity of linear time becoming circular and so achieving eternal return as simply, or should I say as complexly, as that" (132).46 Or as Kit reflects, when they get to Torino, which we're told might as well be Denver, "[W]ell full fuckin circle"; later along the same circumference, when he's examining warplanes ("in" the next paragraph), Kit is advised, "[E]very wing section you'll come across looks just like a circle after a Zhukovsky transformation" (1068). This has all already happened before, and we're connecting the bilocated dots into an Emersonian circle. These circles also intersect with Pynchon's claim that most events are "foreseeable," and simply haven't happened yet—this prospect reflects the Emersonian notion that preexisting time, as Roswell says, unfolds.47 All the events o(ATD have already happened, including the ones that haven't; it is as though the narrator is thawing, not narrating, events. We can skip forward or backward in time at will. Repeatedly, the narrator offers us asides such as, "We of the futurity know that the unit in question was the sinister ... low speed steerable torpedo" (706). The joke is, there is no fu ture. If the narrator, unlike Thorn, is actually "from the future," there is no present at all (544). Further, the narrator's use of "we" raises the ques tion of whether he too is doubled, or identifying with we living readers; being pretentious; emulating the royal semantics of John Winthrop; or whether the "same" consciousness is narrating the text all the way through, or is hijacked and warped by what it narrates, or whether our definitions of unified individual consciousness don't apply to such a narrator. (When he comments on events "some years back," is the narrator viewing time through, or being in any way constrained by, the nearest subjectivity? [619].) Echoes then occur in "the fourth dimension of time" in a book that is already present all at once; in a realm of "the already seen," all reading is rereading and haunting (617). Acknowledging the connection of this atemporal fugue to the act of reading itself, the narrator admits, for ex ample, that the two timelines of narrative and "reality" intersect in ways we cannot wholly comprehend: "[Presently he is not so much reading as engaged in a confab with one of the high priests, finding out this is a city not yet fully come into being" (925). In ATD, all narrative confab is also narrative prefab. When Reef took out a Chums of Chance novel, he "be gan to read, and soon, whatever 'soon' meant," became aware that he was, overdeterminedly, in the dark (215). (So might Don Quixote start to read about his adventures in the "first half' of his own text.) Why does the nar rator repeatedly go out of his way to highlight time in relation to reading? How now is soon? How "now" is everybody—?</page><page sequence="26">116 RICHARD HARDACK ATD begins and ends with such temporal disjunctions, as the narrator remarks on the first page that "Darby, as my faithful readers will remem ber, was the 'baby' of the crew," and frequently asserts, with a kind of temporally dramatic irony, that "[i]t will be recalled that" (3, 7). The fu ture "will be" the past. As with the sixties, however, if you remember Darby, you probably weren't there. Sometimes, the narrator more simply engages in standard narratological anticipation or dramatic irony: "In view of what was nearly upon them, however—as [Kit] would later un derstand" (778).48 Sometimes, we're told what the characters would only subsequently, from some unclear vantage of the present, decipher: "Years later, [Kit and Dally] would be unable to agree on how they found them selves" on the tram, and the narrator relates what each (will have) remem bered (910). But the narrator is not just wholly outside time; he finally draws events and characters there with him. We are told at long intervals of "[a] town which as yet was little more than a wishful real-estate ven ture" and of "linking stations for towns which do not, strictly exist" (172, 230). And we also soon learn, in the narrator's play with tenses, that as the gunners eradicate time, "what they saw 'now' in the sights was in fact what did not yet exist but what would only be a few seconds from 'now'" (256). As most readers will recognize, Pynchon's multivalent text endlessly refers to events that haven't happened yet, yet have already been recorded. Representing a surprisingly direct reference to Melquiades in Garcia Mar quez's One Hundred Years of Solitude (and its Quixotic lineage), The Bool{ of Iceland Spar contains family histories going back to the first discovery of the mineral, "including a record of each day of this very Expedition now in progress, even of days not yet transpired" (133). (Melquiades's book of the world similarly chronicles everything, including that book's own destruc tion. Like Ruskin in his preterite Praeterita, we race our own eschatology in such encyclopedic texts hopelessly trying to catch up with our own nar ration.) Along similar lines, Lew experiences "more than everyday deja vu, the old two-places-at-once condition, kicking up again, he couldn't be sure if he was remembering this now or, worse, foreseeing her in some way, so that he had to worry about the possibility that not only might Jardine Maraca be dead but also that it had not happened yet" (1058). (That phrase recurs throughout the book: "[I]t's so far away the new hasn't reached here 'yet'? Or it hasn't happened 'yet'?" [577].) "Now" and "yet" must always be placed in quotation marks in ATD. The narrator tells us that Renzo'spic chiata was perhaps the first "expression in Northern Italy of a Certain Word that would not quite exist for another year or two. But somehow like a precognitive murmur, a dreamed voice, it had already provisionally</page><page sequence="27">NARR ATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 117 entered Time" (1071). (In the timeless narrative dimension, "another year or two" is indistinguishable from "a few seconds from now." Here, the "Certain" word might also represent a pun regarding the strident, psycho pathic self-assurance of fascism.) This time entry—in which narrative can never depict the act of narration itself, the last sentence being written—is elsewhere referred to as "the invasion of Time into a timeless world," which can only be experienced as revelation (223). (Time, as Philip K. Dick might characterize it, is a demonological or divine invasion into our horological world.) As in Ruskin or Borges, narration is always just out of reach, invisible, a doppelganger with whom we can never be unified. Its time cannot be our time. Like the narrator, characters begin to come unhinged from time, among other things. Professor Vanderjuice eventually describes how he walked a few steps, but "saw I was standing not on a roof, but on an executioner's scaffold, as if somehow I had already carried out my modest attentat, been arrested, tried and condemned for it, and was now awaiting the ultimate penalty. Talk about anomalies in Time!" (1079). The "event in the sky" is repeatedly adumbrated and reintroduced out of sequence. More generi cally typical of Pynchon, ATD is also full of anachronistic jokes, for exam ple regarding deck-designer "Pixie" Colman Smith drawing "pixielated" cards; the Vulcan live-long-and-prosper sign translated as the Hebrew let ter shin (as tracked through Leonard Nimoy himself); references to "Bur gher Kings"; and Kennedy's "Ich bin ein Berliner" speech preincarnated in a donut (perhaps history is a donut closed at both ends) (901, 237, 626, 914). But those jokes lead to the question: when is this narrator of the futu rity? Is he in the characters' future or "our" present or, like the "events" of texts, outside time altogether? Is he part of the Italian Futurity, which also seem to bring back Dante's hell in modernist form, perhaps as "the Hell of-the-future"? (1070). (Several times toward the end of the book, Pyn chon alludes to people who might suffer from a kind of inverted Cottard's syndrome—characters who are "like the mindless dead, who don't know they're dead," and who are already in hell or purgatory, in endless repeti tion [1077].) One could do a trope-by-trope cross-referencing of echoes between GR and ATD, but I here briefly document a few of the "slant-rhymes" be tween the texts that reify the abolition of time in those narratives. The narrator of GR, for example, asserts that "the war has been reconfiguring time and space into its own image. The track runs in different networks now" (257). As if the text were responding in anticipation, in ATD we are asked, what were you "saying about sending these pictures off onto differ ent tracks . . . other possibilities?" (1060, ellipsis in the original). Both "ear</page><page sequence="28">118 RICHARD HARDACK lier" and "later," in GR, the war is "an astonishing network of market operations winking on, winking off across the embattled continent" (112). \nATD, we are told, "Among distant sounds of repeated explosion could also be heard the strident massed buzzing of military aircraft... across the embattled countryside" (1025). Descriptions such as "Heard you were here in the zone Stray" (1011) or of Reef s penis, which came "to exhibit a mind of its own," adumbrating Slothrop (881), suggest that many of the references to forces InATD are meant to preface those in GR. It's not clear whether the narrator can read Reefs second mind, but s/he/it remains committed to the intertextual principle of equal opportunity conscious ness. Do these repetitions reflect internal or external realities, or sabotage the very distinction itself? As we're told in numerous variations mATD, "It is comforting to imagine this as an outward and visible manifestation of something else," or an "outward and visible metaphor" (ATD, 655, 811). Emblematically derived from Puritan sermons, and found verbatim in Melville's Pierre, this transcendental idiom suggests the phenomenal world is a reflection/apocalypse of the mind: but it also conjures the out ward and visible manifestations of the inward and invisible narrator, an inconsistent, perhaps inchoate metanarrator who nevertheless connects Pynchon's texts.49 \nATD, maps are "outward and visible notation of what lay within" (860); in GR, empire chairs "are no longer quite outward and visible signs of a game of chance" (202). In V, we encounter "implicit ac ceptance of the four episodes as outward and visible signs of an inward and spiritual grace" (152). In Mason, we are given an "outward and bodily sign" of internal turmoil (358). These outward and visible manifestations continue to mark the internal collapse of differentiation, here between in ternal and external, which themselves become necessary doubles. The world remains mind incarnated, impersonated. That so many characters in Pynchon's works adopt this phrase also sug gests a correspondence of world and consciousness, as presided over by some overarching narrative force, again "in a sort of code, outward and visible notation for what lay within" (860). If, as we saw earlier, invisibility is "encrypted," visibility is encoded. For the Indians of Chiapas, light itself is a "living tissue. As the brain is the outward and visible expression of the Mind" (992). (Since light is a secret determinant of history, under Pyncho nian syllogism, history itself is also alive.) In GR, we are given numerous descriptions of "Earth's mindbody," if not time "to get over the wonder of finding that Earth is a loving critter" (590). If the world, as we have seen everywhere in Pynchon's works, is living, we wind up with a strict, if not</page><page sequence="29">NARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 119 always decipherable, Emersonian correspondence between invisible mind and visible matter, and of narrators and minds. This radical idealist (or pop psychological, solipsistic, narcissistic, para noid, or, to use technical language, plain fucked up) proposition finally indicates that all difference is reflexive: in its most extreme application, it means "each star and planet we can see in the Sky is but the reflection of our single Earth along a different Minkowskian space-time track. Travel to other worlds is therefore travel to alternate versions of the same Earth" (1020).50 "Travel" to other consciousnesses is therefore travel to alternate manifestations of the same person, alternate versions of the same, side wise. Like George Harrison returning from India, transcendentalists arrive without traveling. Even worse, these ghosts may be "partially, de fectively, our own dead selves, thrust back" (1023). All characters and voices are just variations of... me, double or nothing. In Emersonian transcendentalism, we are always puss chasing our own tales, or snakes with those tails in our mouths (Emerson, "Experience," in Worths [see note 14], 3:80). It helps, but we need not be paranoid to see these connections. In GR, we also translate the inward and invisible into the outward and visible: '"If the house is organic,' argued the crafty early Toiletship advocates, 'family lives in the house, family's organic, house is an outward and visible sign'" (448). (This assertion is another example of not only a syllogism, but a transcendental "identitarian" trope.) Or "|i]f there is such a thing as the City Sacramental, the city as outward and visible sign of inward spiritual illness or health," it makes an earlier appearance in ATD (372). In GR, "money in the Puritan sense [is]—an outward and visible O.K. on their intentions" (652). Pynchon again is probably parodying some of these ideas even as he stages them, but one cannot disengage his irrefragable reliance on them from what he elucidates. One could also claim these phrases are Pynchon's literary tics, but I would argue they are his narrative tocks, his way to move against the day, to pursue radical temporal dislocations. In GR, the rocks whose timescale of being stretches out as "frames per millennium" also lead the Sentient Rocksters to believe that even (or especially) "history as it's been laid on the world is only a fraction, an outward-and-visible fraction" (612). A rock that doesn't roll much, and that moves too slowly for our vision, also re minds us of the end of GR, of "the film we have not learned to see," the rock(et) about to star in a different movie (760). All such invisible forces, like the narrator of ATD, may be epistemologically incommensurate for us, beyond our powers of assimilation. That is, the outward and visible</page><page sequence="30">120 RICHARD HARDACK locates the ulterior order always already present, but inaccessible. In that light, can the future only confirm the past? Given all the repetitions, con nections, and continuities, ATD and GR appear hyperlinked and perhaps need to be read as texts happening at the same time. A GREATER INVISIBILITY Now— —The last word of the penultimate section of Gravity's Rainbow (760) That this has all precisely happened before, but must be compared to ev erything now, is a proviso that applies as much to Against the Day as to Gravity's Rainbow. On the other hand, what about "those stepping off the night precipice of this journey, who would never be here, never exactly here, again[?J" (747). One can only drown in the same river, the here and now, once. How do we negotiate difference in repetition? GR ends, as we "follow the bouncing ball," with a mock Puritan hymn, the invocation of a "face in ev'ry mountainside, / And a Soul in ev'ry stone"-—and the nar rator then intoning "Now everybody—" (760).51 That univocalization crucially gathers people in space and time. (That line might also be an imperative variation of Mucho's call to transcendental unification through song.) By critical contrast, or continuity, ATD begins with "Now single up all lines!"52 Those lines are kinds of overlapping sentences, one final ex hortation, one initiatory now. Now doubled, now-now. In the end, these displacements and doublings bring us back to the pol itics of radicalism, which remain closely connected to invisibility. Stray, for example, remembers her earlier "notions of the Anarchist life and its promise of a greater invisibility" (976, emphasis in the original). Such seems to be Pynchon's teleology of narration, when characters disappear and perhaps become invisible voices. (At times, this dematerialization even seems to represent a process of spiritual rebirth.) Who goes off the grid, becomes invisible, or declines to be further oblivionated by daguerreo type?—Slothrop, and of course his creator, though Slothrop might turn up on an album cover and Pynchon under a brown paper bag (when "ap pearing" on The Simpsons). In Pynchon's texts, invisibility is a strategy of resistance, and perhaps a way to elide the wrong kind of doubling. The Chums might have also disappeared to their counter-earth, perhaps across if not against the day. And perhaps the point of the text, as in Vineland, is to document the events that "history would [otherwise] be blind to," to</page><page sequence="31">NARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 121 record those voices no one else "will be left to remember" (1016, 1001). The preterite are politically and historically invisible. But perhaps deuces can be offset by "crazy Anarchists trying to start unions every time a man's back is turned"—unions that single up the lines, that unexpectedly bring together boys and girls and "transcend the old political space" (1053, 1083). (In the book's last twenty pages, many characters also either don't show signs of age or grow younger.) Union might transcend the old spaces and times and finally transcribe the greatest part of history unseen until now. (Pynchon's ulterior point might be that, from Mucho to Pointsman, most doubling is solipsistic and represents false union.) Temporal refugees ex periencing the future at "the end of the capitalistic experiment," when the thermodynamic truth of finite resources is accepted, "were \stc\ forced to migrate ... upon that dark fourth-dimensional Atlantic known as Time." This "Fraternity of the Venturesome" might also be doubles for the Chums, "trespassers" in different boats "against [different] current[sj" (415,418). At the same "time," at the "end" of ATD, the political reality, literally on the ground, is that space is being partitioned, not unified. As the old earthbound frontier was lost, "here at the high edge of the atmosphere was the next [invisible | untamed frontier, pioneers arriving in airships instead of wagons"; but we're also told the expansion had already set in motion property disputes that would last generations, as entities effectively go about "colonizing the sky" (121, 131). (As the Captain should know by now, though, time is the final frontier.) Instead of a new homestead, we have "Ray-rushes" and "calcite rushes" and perhaps finally Hollywood rushes (121, 128). After this gold rush, we have only now. ATD is also about the ends of things, especially innocence (184). And repetition might turn out to preclude going back; say something twice and you're experi enced: "The cycle, Yashmeen, [sic\ speculated might only seem reversible, for once to the top and down again, one would be changed 'forever'" (503). Cast against all these collapses into eternal return are what we might term free indirect radicals, or a variety of anarchists, who seek a geogra phy or politics without repetition, return, or self-loss; they hope to find a space-time outside the Zone, such as the Argentinean, anarchist Pampas that exist only for a moment in GR. Virgil here claims he "likes to lose |himself] in reveries of when the land was free, before it got hijacked by capitalist Christer Republicans" (1058). Later, Reef, heading West, also hopes to "find someplace, some deep penultimate town the capitalist/ Christer gridwork hadn't gotten quite yet" (1075). But ironically, the an archist hope itself is repeated and so "fenced in." (The frontier represents that lost horizon, the American Pampas, but even here "you could feel it,</page><page sequence="32">122 RICHARD HARDACK unmistakably, like a divide, where you knew you could stand and piss would flow two ways at once" [53—54].) The Pampas are emblematic of a space where doubling had been suspended, but that cannot be maintained. It is always just around the aether or already lost. The connections we are losing represent both force and counterforce; the system of representation is neutral, or functions like its subjects, and must be doubled. But as Hunter asks Dally, "Political space has its neutral ground. But does Time? Is there such a thing as the neutral hour?" (577). All these slight displacements become destiny and destination. At the end of ATD, a truthy Inconvenience, now invisible in the sky, becomes its own destination and its own temporal dislocation. (Possibly again follow ing the nominative arc of Star Tre\, the Chums' airship, of course, is itself an update of the "H.M.S. Inconvenience" in Mason [28].) If, as Brian McHale claims, issues of geography dominate Mason, where time is spa tialized, time dominates ATD, where space is both temporalized and tem porized—that is, itself both "early" and "late" ("Mason &amp; Dixon in the Zone," 49). When someone is involved in a "time discrepancy," "he is not here, not completely. He is slightly somewhere else. Enough so, to present some inconvenience" (599). Or for some Inconvenience to be present? The only way to escape eternal return, the repetition of failed revolution, might be to manipulate time itself. Perhaps the Inconvenience then takes over the narrator in "being everywhere, but invisible," and its function is to be slightly elsewhere, slightly sidewise, slightly Utopian (928). Against expectation, then, it is not the anarchists, the futurists, or any other political group that travels against the day. It is the boyhood Chums who cross into the political narrative, developing their "supranational idea" that the third dimension was the "avenue of transcendence," and not a means for delivering explosives (1083). It is the Chums who become in visible all around us. The narrator asks if "we" could imagine for them a vector where the birds are heard everywhere but are invisible, where the night is no longer violated by light displaced from Hell (1082-83)? Is this some kind of hucksterism that asks us to believe childhood innocence can be restored after it's been lost? The Chums have not yet observed any sign of their wishes suddenly coming true in this "known Creation," one that might be connected to the dualized Creation of GR (1085). But the narra tor also tells us the newly co-ed Chums soon will feel the turn in the wind, perhaps the hand, as William Slothrop prayed, that will turn the time. How soon was now? This leaves us, like the Traverses, with the mathe matical problem of radical politics; how can the new or the radical escape what has already happened? How can the past escape the future? What or whose day are we up against? How, what, where and when do we line up?</page><page sequence="33">NARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 123 Richard Hardac^ was a Javits fellow at University of California—Berkeley, at which he received his doctorates in English and law.

An early version of this essay was presented to the Biennial International Pynchon Conference, Munich, June 2008; my thanks to Sascha Poelmann and the other conference organizers and participants, and to Torsten Kathke and Carrie Andrews for their wonderful hospitality. 1. Thomas Pynchon, Against the Day (New York: Penguin, 2006), 262. After the initial references, all of Pynchon's works are cited in the text as follows: The Crying of Lot 49 (Lot 49), Gravity's Rainbow (GR), Mason &amp; Dixon (Mason), and Against the Day (ATD). 2. These lyrics are from David Byrne (Talking Heads), "Psycho Killer," Talking Heads 77, Sire Records, 1977. 3. Leo Bersani, The Culture of Redemption (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1990), 182. 4. Ibid., 193. In the context of Leo Bersani's assessment of encyclopedic texts, which are also books without borders, one might also note that Joyce's Ulysses stages a different but paradigmatic set of doubles in a city of doubles—D(o)ublin—using historical/mytho logical echoes. 5. Thomas Pynchon, Gravity's Rainbow (1973; repr., New York: Penguin, 1995), 186. 6. As Peter Cooper suggests, Pynchon's characters are often "absurd . .. because they try to make a metaphor literal" (Signs and Symptoms: Thomas Pynchon and the Contemporary World [Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983], 107). For Pynchon, we have only reified metaphors to define ourselves; in Lot 49, they are "figures of speech then, metaphors. . .. The Demon makes the metaphor not only verbally graceful, but also objectively true" (77). In the West, only those purportedly too animistic or close to nature fail to distinguish between the figurative and literal (or "objectively true"). For Jung, for example, "If we take our metaphors concretely we return to the primitive point of view" ("Archaic Man," in Civilization in Transition, vol. 10 of The Collected Wor\s of C. G. Jung, ed. Herbert Read, Michael Fordham, and Gerhard Adler, trans. R. F. C. Hull, 2nd ed. [1964; repr., Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1970], 50-73, quotation on 65). For Northrop Frye, "In all our ordinary experience the metaphor is non-literal: nobody but a savage or a lunatic can take metaphor literally" (Fables of Identity [New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1963], 136). Transcendental pantheists—and their "primitive and lunatic" and possibly "schizoid" personae or characters—often take metaphor literally, embody thought, and reify these animistic tropes. Victoria Nelson also reviews the way the "concretization of language" is related to Neoplatonic theories, the "primitive" and paranoia, and reminds us, via Louis Sass, that schizophrenics are "overly abstract as well as overly concrete," a condition that applies to many of Pynchon's characters without borders (The Secret Life of Puppets [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2001], 308,311). 7.

I would also note that puns in Pynchon embody the principle of bilocation. In terms relevant to Pynchon's narratology, Mitchum Huelms asserts that puns mean "two things absolutely simultaneously" ('"The Space that may not be seen': The Form of Historicity in Mason &amp; Dixon," in The Multiple Worlds of Pynchon's "Mason &amp; Dixon ": Eighteenth Century Contexts and Postmodern Observations, ed. Elizabeth J. W. Hinds [Rochester, NY: Camden House, 2005], 25—46, quotation on 43). Among many critics who rightly emphasize Pynchon's obsession with language, Irving Malin warns of "the linguistic duplicity" of puns ("Foreshadowing the Text," in Pynchon and "Mason &amp; Dixon," ed. Brooke Horvath and Irving Malin [Newark: University of Delaware Press, 2000], 27-42, quotation on 27). 9. Dorrit Cohn, Transparent Minds: Narrative Modes for Presenting Consciousness in Fiction (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1984), 11. 10. Ibid. 11. Molly Hite contends that this principle helped structure the multiple perspectives of GR. See her Ideas of Order in the Novels of Thomas Pynchon (Columbus: Ohio State University Press 1983), 143; and Joyce's Voices (Urbana-Champaign, IL: Dalkey Archives, 2007), 21,35. 12. Cohn, Transparent Minds, 29. 13. Though hypertrophied in ATD, such voicing is not unusual in Pynchon's novels: in Vineland, for example, after long sections of quoted dialogue, the narrator imitates DL's voice when telling us, without quotation marks, "Uh-uh, the way she'd be ... of all the jacking around she was getting, that makeover would prove to be the real shocker" (140). 14. Ralph Waldo Emerson, The Complete Worlds of Ralph Waldo Emerson, 12 vols., ed. Edward Waldo Emerson (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin, 1904), quotation in 12:32. 15. Perhaps an example of this "traversion" occurs when Miles has what appears to be a "prophetic vision of St. Mark, but in reverse" (ATD, 250) (recalling Mucho's claim that he can hear or construct music, "but... in reverse" [105]). As Mr. Ace—who has eyes "presented like weapons in a duel," but never seems to meet up with Mr. Deuce—offers, the underlying question is "how to transform the class of thermochemical reactions once known as 'irreversible processes,' notable among them human aging and death, so as actually to reverse them" (415—16). 16. D. H. Lawrence, "Pan in America," in Phoenix: The Posthumous Papers ofD. H. Lawrence (1936; repr., New York: Viking, 1972), 22-31, quotation on 25—26. 17. Every Pynchon text offers a series of such pronouncements—in Mason, when Matthew Marine complains, "[Y]ou'd think these Instruments were alive," he's told, "[M]ay be they are alive" (Mason &amp; Dixon [New York: Harry Holt, 1997], 445). Though his hallucinogenic name makes him hard to take too seriously—even when we remember that many of Pynchon's most significant characters, like Mucho, have similarly absurd, or perhaps "preterite," names—Maskelyne asserts he "firmly believed this Place a conscious Creature, animated by power drawn from beneath the Earth" (128). The narrator tells us, "Yet, considered as a sentient being," a ship continued to act like a bellicose sailor (40). Later, Mason asks whether Maskelyne had "reach'd a Compact with the Island, as if 'twere sentient" (182). 18.

Mitchum Huelms reads William Emerson's postscript regarding "the space that may not be seen" (326) as part of Pynchon's attempt "not to render time visible, but to produce meaning from time itself." According to Huelms, Pynchon invokes Emerson's perpetual motion watch, various narrative tricks and narrators existing at different times to "superimpose linear and cyclical models of time" onto Mason. Time there "loops back without ever perfectly returning" to itself ("The Space," 26). Huelms also suggests that Cherrycoke's tendency to ventriloquize the speech of other characters helps unite multiple narratives (and therefore times) ("The Space," 36). 19.

"Flows of Power" in Mason &amp; Dixon (522) also return as "flows of power" in ATD (242). 26. The intertextual presence of the Traverses suggests that a form of genealogic repetition helps structure the novel: "The 'Traverse' family whose lines run through the novel" maybe also form the lines to single up (see generally Henry Veggian, "Thomas Pynchon Against the Day," Boundary 35 [2008]: 197—215, quotation on 202). But "an American stoker named O.I.C. Bodine" also appears in ATD (517), suggesting that Pynchon is also playing with a Faulknerian repetition of family histories (though Pynch[e]on's own family provides sufficient example for historical/textual reappearances). 27. See Steven C. Weisenburger, who tracks instances of hysteron proteron throughout GR as "trope[s] of backward motion, regression, and reversal of cause and effect" (A "Gravity's Rainbow" Companion [1988; repr., Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2006], 34). 28. Sometimes the intertextual elements are more contemporary and reflect dialogue rather than echo. ATD suggests that Pynchon is discursively, in minor ways, responding to Ian Wedde's response to GR in his postmodern novel, Symmes Hole. Wedde is a contempo rary New Zealand writer who incorporated many of the salient geopolitical concerns of Melville's life and works, and even the character of Melville himself, into that novel. Aside from frequently referring to the "existence of a so-called 'hollow earth'" and travels through "the planet's interior"; "the heart of earth"; numerous "Symmes Street[s]"; mappings that carry "into the Invisible of geography"; and wars enacted as</page><page sequence="36">126 RICHARD HARDACK though they were "only some metaphorical struggle, with large dollar sums replacing casualty figures," Pynchon even in his syntax here echoes Wedde's own echo of Pynchon (115, 410, 786,453,327, 738). Both authors are using consonant primary source material, but if we go through Symmes Hole, we might come out in ATD. Travel through the hollow earth in ATD serves as counterpoint to the mapping of the sky, but also as narrativization of Wedde's premise that the hollow earth serves as a critical metaphor for U.S. imperialism and exceptionalism. See generally Wedde, Symmes Hole (Auckland, New Zealand: Penguin, 1986). 29.

That flight toward grace might also reflect Pynchon's reply to the surprisingly optimistic ending of DeLillo's Underworld, which closes with the word "Peace." Mark Osteen, for example, contends that we can "find transcendence in unlikely places, as the very emblems of capital are transmuted into an economy of grace" (American Magic and Dread: Don DeLillo's Dialogue with Culture [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000], 258). 31.

Annie Dillard describes her transcendental project in Holy the Firm (New York: Harper and Row, 1977) in similar terms: "There is, in short, one country, one room, one enormous window, one cat, one spider, and one person: but I am hollow" (24).

But "[w]hat Enzian wants to create"—against the specific backdrop of a "transcendental" German appropriation of African religion—"will have no his tory. .. . Time, as time is known to the other nations, will whither away inside this new one. The Erdschweinhohle will not be bound, like the Rocket, to time. The people will find the Center again, the Center without time, the journey without hysteresis, where every departure is a return to the same place, the only place. . . ." (GR, 319). 38. Pynchon remains ambivalent about collective consciousness. As he illustrates in Lot 49, it's a short trip from Mucho Maas's delusional, communal identity to Hilarius's delusional, fascist identity. In GR, however, the war transforms certain kinds of collective consciousness into forms of resistance. Wartime graffiti, suspected of all being written by the same author, is "enough to make you believe in a folk-consciousness." But "the war does not appear to want a folk-consciousness . .. [only] a machine of many separate parts" (181, 152).</page><page sequence="37">NARRATOLOGY IN AGAINST THE DAY 127 39.

Victoria Nelson also characterizes the "mystic geography" of V. as part of Godolphin's "mapping expedition into the heart of Asia," which led to the discovery of Vheissu, and which might serve as another "Symzonian" adumbration of the Asian and hollow-earth topography of ATD (Secret Life of Puppets, 155, 149).

Rao's comment might paraphrase Emerson's claim in "The American Scholar" that "there is never an end, to the inexplicable continuity of this web of God, but always circular power returning into itself' (in Works [see note 14], 1:83—85). 47. Transcendentalists generally don't adhere to Western, post-Renaissance notions of temporality and inferiority. As a result, according to Emerson, "Egypt, Greece, Rome, Gaul, Britain, America, lit folded already in the first man" ("History," in Works [see note 14], 2:4, my emphasis). For Emerson, "The soul contains in itself the event that shall presently befall it, for the event is only the actualizing of its thoughts" ("Demonology," in Works [see note 14], 10:9). In transcendentalism, much as with Merle's photos, all events are "unfoldings" of embryonic microcosms and preexisting events. Reverend J. M. Manning, a nineteenth-century historian of American pantheism, castigates the pantheistic Spinoza on the same grounds: "A being to whom understanding, will, and even personality is denied; a being who does not create, but simply is; who does not act, but simply unfolds" (Half Truths and the Truth [Boston: Lee and Shepard, 1871], 76). Beings and events that are realized or actualized in such predetermined or teleological fashion exist outside linear time. 48. Such statements reflect a wide-ranging extension of what Brian McHale identifies as the "subjunctive mode" in GR and Mason—hypotheticals that might have come to pass in ATD become not just parallel or alternate, but "present," futures ("Mason &amp; Dixon in the Zone, or a Brief Poetics of Pynchon-Space," in Horvath and Malin, Pynchon and "Mason &amp; Dixon" [see note 8], 43-62, esp. 44). 49. Victoria Nelson describes such obsession with externalization as a manifestation of new expressionism, in which "the inner is made visible in the outer," and "the transcenden tal ... is made visible in the physical landscape" (Secret Life of Puppets, 215). 50. As though anticipating such a phenomenological proliferation of worlds—the individ ual "rathouses" being built in V, or Oedipa in Lot 49, who must project, if not build, her own Emersonian world—Charles Bray, the British author of Illusion and Delusion; or, Modern Pantheism Versus Spiritualism (London: Thomas Scott, 1873), asserts that "[t]here</page><page sequence="38">128 RICHARD HARDACK is not one world then, but thousands of worlds, as each creature creates its own, and all made out of the same stuff, which is not matter, but mind" (71). 51. Such invocations are found throughout GR—"Now, sing along"; these descriptions become increasingly all-inclusive, until "everyone is singing now" (175, 639). 52. As the, perhaps appropriately, collectively authored Pynchon Wif(i notes, "single up all lines" is used in its more familiar nautical context in every other novel but Vineland: "Perhaps we can understand this 'line' as a text-string linking Pynchon's novels together ... in preparation for a voyage to . .. ?"
