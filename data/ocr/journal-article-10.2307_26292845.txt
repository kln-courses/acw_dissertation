The population of 110 Neolithic inhabitants comprised 77 adults and 33 juvenile  individuals. The skeletal material studied underwent anthropological and morphological analyses, which detected  26 males, 48 females, 33 children and 3 indeterminable individuals. The stature in males reached 165.7 cm, in females  154.7 cm; the representation of females was generally higher than that of males, most of the adults died at the age of  20–29. The aim of the research was to reconstruct the life of an Early Neolithic population that changed over from the  hunter-gatherer to agricultural economics. The analysis of skeletal remains proved permanent and distinctive structures  on bones in 57 individuals, as a reflection of long-time everyday activity related to the agricultural way of life and food  processing (bone lips on finger phalanges) or the use of teeth as a work tool. The extent of detected alterations and  damages was varied, the changes occurred gradually at the level of individuals. The transformation of social structure gave a reason to social differentiation. The adaptation to new living conditions  in the first farmers was associated with building of cultic areas, displays of spiritual culture, and burial rituals typical  of the New Stone Age population. Regarding the number of settlers and the period of existence, the phenomenon of the  Neolithic population from Vedrovice will always pertain to unique and rare examples of cemeteries in the Neolithic  prehistory of Central Europe.

Representation of females The group of 48 females was divided by age as follows: 10  Juvenis (15–19 years), 8 Adultus I (20–29 years), 9 Adultus  II (30–39 years), 9 Maturus I (40–49 years), 7 Maturus II FIGURE 95.

With regard to age, the examined skeletal series comprised  10 juvenile and 38 adult females. The evaluation focused on  characteristic features typical of particular age categories,  and on possible morphological differences detected. Skulls: in 6 females the skulls were not preserved, and  in 3 cases only cranial fragments occurred. In 7 females  only the right or left half of the skull could be found, and  in 4 females only partial cranial vault. In 13 females there  was a damaged or incomplete calvaria. Only 15 females  from the whole skeletal series exhibited a well-preserved  skull with mandible. The skulls of juvenile females were gracile as supposed,  with indistinct arcus superciliares, small processi mastoidei,  and flat glabella. Cranial occiput exhibited a weakly  developed topography with indistinct torus occipitalis  (27/76, 62/78, 83/80). The skulls of adult females were  mostly medium-sized or robust, with arched feminine  forehead, with flat glabella or glabella of stage I, with  very small arcus superciliares, indicated frontal eminences  and postorbital constriction, FIGURE 96.  Maxilla of female No. 68/78 with surface striations in processus marginalis was both I2 teeth. irregular in shape. In several cases a prognathic maxilla  (10/89, 68/78) could be detected, asymmetrically worn  anterior teeth (70/79), and the use of teeth as work tools  (Figures 95–97). Cranial occiput was arched or slightly  angled, planum nuchale on the occipital bone exhibited  a weakly developed torus occipitalis and indistinct  topography. In robust skulls the forehead was arched or  recessive, the supraorbital region mostly with a massive  ridge arcus superciliaris (97/80), distinct glabella, wide  zygomatic bones with tuberculum marginale, and robust  processi mastoidei. Amongst all the females only one  (75/79) had a very robust skull (Figure 98a, b). Mandibles  were robust, with everted lateral margins, the surface  furrowed due to masseteric tuberosities. In the occipital  region occurred a prominent protuberantia occipitalis  externa, uneven planum nuchale, and distinct attachment  sites of neck muscles, which are typical of very robust  skulls (22/75, 36/76, 45/77, 75/79, 81a/79).

Vertebral column: the vertebrae in females were mostly  not preserved, the extant thoracic and lumbar vertebrae of vertebrae was not sufficient for any interpretation. It  exhibited spondylosis (9/74, 22/75), osteophytes (68/78) can be assumed that working activities in females have  or arthritis (Figures 99–101). The destruction of vertebral put strain on the arms and vertebral column so that the  column was caused by lowered height of vertebral bodies, overload displays caused a permanent alteration of bone  and by the effects associated with vanishing intervertebral relief.

Permanent work  load gave also rise to deflected long bones (Figures 103,  104) and forearm bones (Figures 105–108). The displays  on right and left arms were identical, but also cases of  unilateral hypertrophy in the elbow joint occurred (68/78)  or the bilateral robusticity (Figures 109, 110). Not only the  alterations caused by exhausting physical work but also  the effects of repeated working activity were found in the  hands of 13 females. On finger phalanges there are distinct  attachment sites of short flexors in proximal (I) and medial  (II) phalanges, except the thumbs (Figures 111–115).  Distinctive bilateral bone lips can be observed either only on FIGURE 104.  Deflection and distinct muscle attachment sites in the  phalanges proximales (22/75, 102/81) or on both phalanges proximal part of humeri in female No. 91/80. proximales and phalanges mediae (21/75, 68/78, 70/79,  91/80, 104/81) or only in the middle parts of phalanges  proximales (9/74, 97/80). Cases of finger phalanges without  bone lips occurred as well (64/78, 72/79). Os coxae: the hip bone in females is important not only  for the determination of sex basing on the shape of incisura  ischiadica major, but also for the information whether or  not the female had delivered during her life, according to the  presence of sulcus praeauricularis on the pelvis (Figures  116–121). From the series of 48 females examined there  are 19 females who had delivered, according to preserved  sulcus praeauricularis on their pelvic bones (9/74, 10/89,  22/75). Two females had died during delivery (81/79, 93/80, FIGURE 105.  Deflection of ulnae in female No. 22/75. Figures 65–66), in two females (48/77, 91/80) the present  sulcus praeauricularis was not conclusive, and in one  case it was not sufficiently preserved (105/81). The pelvis  in several females was not extant, and only 6 females of  the entire skeletal series had not delivered (75/79, 94/80,  97/80, 101/81, 6/88, 9/88). Skeleton of free lower limb: the female femurs were  either long and slender or robust, with distinct topography  at the attachment sites of gluteal muscles forming a deep  cavity below the tuberositas glutaea (36/76, 68/78, 1/85,  6/88), a large tubercle below the trochanter (70/79) as well  as lateral bone depressions (91/80, 93/80, 94/80). The  shape of linea aspera was either indistinct (75/79, 80/79) FIGURE 106.  Deflection and distinct muscle attachment sites in ulnae  or distinctive (103/81). In two females an asymmetry of female No. 42/77. in the length of femurs could be detected – femur dx. in  skeleton 21/75 is longer by 1.5 cm (Figure 126), and in  skeleton 64/78 by 1.3 cm; the bone extension corresponded  with somewhat more obtuse collo-diaphyseal angle. This  different collo-diaphyseal angle probably caused waddling  gait or was compensated at walking by such a posture  that evoked alterations in the lumbar region of vertebral  column. As significant indicators of the state of health can  be considered the detected Harris lines, which were present  only in four females (36/76, 64/78, 68/78, 75/79). Representation of children The examined skeletal series comprised the remains of 33  children who were divided by age as follows: 5 newborns FIGURE 107.

Most frequent amongst the skeletal remains of children  and newborns were skulls and cranial bones. In orbital  roofs appeared cribra orbitalia (1/63, 3/86, 5/88), which  belong to effects of health or alimentation disorders. In  children also occurred the damage and wear of deciduous  teeth and dental enamel, probably caused by consumption  of hard food (Smrčka et al. 2005).

In the 25–30-year-old male 2/85 (Figure 147)  there are coalescent cribra orbitalia (II) in the left orbit,  in a 45–55-year-old male (11/74) bilateral non-coalescent  cribra orbitalia (I), and in a 17–20-year-old male (23/75)  cribra orbitalia could be detected in both orbits. Repeated  occurrence of cribra orbitalia testifies to a long-time  starvation (Hungen 1971), some nutritional defect, iron  deficiency or intestinal diseases. The destruction of orbits  (Carlson et al. 1974) is usually closely associated with the  presence of Harris lines (Piontek et al. 2001). Unclassified osteopathies – Harris lines are horizontal  sclerotic lines, which can be found in metaphyses of long  bones. They are composed of a layer of thickened trabeculae  of spongious bone that occur at distal and proximal ends  of tibiae. In order to prove the presumed occurrence of  Harris lines in clavicles, an X-ray imaging of claviculae  sin. et dx. was carried out. Neither of the total number of  57 radiographs showed any Harris lines in claviculae, even  in those cases where cribra orbitalia were present in 27  individuals. The reason for the occurrence of Harris lines has been  discussed, possible causes are: growth retardation in the  time of strain of the organism, suffered febrile diseases,  starvation or stress situations (Lewis, Roberts 1997,  Horáčková et al. 2004). In the Neolithic population from  Vedrovice, Harris lines were found in 15 males (Figures  148–157), 4 females (Figures 158–161) and 8 children FIGURE 149.

Special alterations in finger phalanges were caused  by many activities: manufacturing cords, grinding grain,  weaving and basketry in females (Figures 111–115). In  males we can suppose some physically more demanding  working activities such as woodworking, construction of  dwellings, extraction of loess soil, pottery making, chipping  stone tools as well as other long-time work loads (Figures  FIGURE 163.

The implementation  of pottery in the earliest agricultural society implied  important changes with regard to processing and storage  of food but also a new subsistence mode. An indispensable  factor was also the aesthetical expression associated with  the manufacture of pottery, and with changes and alterations  of particular vessel forms. Most important, however, was  the use of ceramic vessels for cooking the ground grain,  with the help of which soft food could be obtained, and this  fact was of a crucial social importance. Porridge could also  be used as a substitute for milk, which helped to increase  fertility because the time span between two deliveries  FIGURE 164.
