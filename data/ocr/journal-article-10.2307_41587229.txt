Images of gold, fire and transformation occur throughout the poem, but they are significantly concentrated in Aeneid 8 as the poem and Aeneas move from Troy to an image of Troy's refinement, Rome. In this book, we can trace a recasting of the destructive elements of fires associated with the burning of Troy and the passions which burn within Dido into the fires of the forge, flames of victory, and images of joy associated with the hammering out of the shield of Aeneas, Augustus' victory at Actium, and Rome's celebration of Italy's success. In this vision of savagery transmuted, I have less in mind a Christian image of a purifying or refining fire which wipes clean past sins than a metallurgical one of conversion where traces of the base metal remain.1 I In Vulcan's depiction of Rome after Actium, the city streets roar with joy, games, and applause (laetitia ludisque uiae plausuque fre- mebant, 8.717), and all her temples fill with mothers dancing as bodies of slain bullocks strew the ground before the altars: omnibus in templis matrum chorus, omnibus arae: ante aras terram caesi strauere iuuenci Aen. 8.718-19 In all the temples, a chorus of mothers, in all, altars; before the altars butchered young strewed the ground. 1 While the title of this paper alludes to T. S. Eliot, "Little Gidding III," Four Quartets, a passage which in turn evokes The Wasteland (line 428), and be- hind that Dante's presentation of Arnaut Daniel, Purgatorio 26.148 (cf. Malachi 3:2), I do not mean to suggest that Vergilian aesthetics be read through Christian imagery of purgation, far from it, but to invite comparison between it and possible models of refinement in the Aeneid. Vergilius 46 (2000) 93-113</page><page sequence="2">94 Stephen Scully Vergil's language of celebration does not lack ambiguity, cae si iuuenci, "butchered calves," refers to victims at the altar; and it does not require a long memory to recall the young Polites murdered be- fore the altar at Troy in Aeneid 2 (550-51). Of course, at Rome for- mer images of barbarity are recast; in contrast to recent carnage at Actium, which Vergil calls noua caede (8.695), and the killing of Polites at Troy, bloodletting at Rome is deflected to ritual sacrifice, substituting the killing of animal-young for human slaughter, the proper order between man and gods confirmed and restored.2 This is how we should understand the spirit of exultation in Rome's lae titia, a society and universe set right.3 Rome's laetitia after Actium is linked verbally with Augustus as he prepares for war at Actium: stans celsa in Puppi, geminas cui tempora flammas laeta uomunt patriumque aperitur uertice sidus Aen. 8.680-81 standing on the high prow of his ship, his happy brow shoots forth twin flames and his father's star appears on his head. Again, Vergil's language invites plural readings. On the one hand, the flames leaping from Augustus' joyous brow undoubtedly recall for a Roman audience the flames which appeared from the "Julian star" or comet while Augustus was honoring his adoptive father at his fu- neral games, flames which Servius says Augustus depicted on his own helmet. Within the context of the poem, these magical flames further suggest the portentous flames which licked Ascanius' hair in 2 For ambiguities in the phrase caesi iuuenci, see Julia T. Dyson, "Caesi iuuenci and Pietas impia in Virgil," С J 91 (1996) 277-86, and Michael Put- nam, Virgil's Epic Designs: Ekphrasis in the Aeneid (New Haven 1998) 150 and 159-60. Unless noted otherwise, all translations in this paper are my own. 3 The etymology of laetus is uncertain; although frequently associated with plants, crops, and fields, Cicero claims its meaning of fertile is metaphoric, its base meaning being joyful or happy {De Orat. 3.155).</page><page sequence="3">Refining Fire in Aeneid 8 95 book 2 (680-84) and those which danced about Lavinia' s head in book 7 (71-80), both signs of Rome's future greatness. These flames further link Augustus with Aeneas, when flames will spring from the helmet and shield of Rome's founding hero as he stands high on the prow of his ship and prepares for war against the Rutulians.4 The adjective laetus also describes Aeneas as he is about to re- ceive Vulcan's shield (8.617). At this moment of joy, flames vomit forth from Aeneas' helmet ( galeam flammasque uomentem, 8.620), as they do from Augustus' brow at Actium.5 Reading backwards then from the end of book 8, we witness a chain of joy and porten- tous fire linking the happiness at Rome after Actium, the figure of Augustus preparing for Actium, and Aeneas as shield-bearer in an earthly trinity of Roma herself, new founder, and mythic founder moving toward history's divinely ordained end.6 On the other hand, Vergil characteristically complicates such simple lines of praise. Verbal echoes linking Augustus at Actium with the monstrous Cacus of Italy's past call into question lofty im- ages of Roman achievements:7 4 Compare 8.680-81 and 10.261 and 270-71. 5 On 8.680-81, see Gerhard Binder, Aeneas und Augustus: Interpretationen zum 8.

For a hero's shift in mood from gloom to laetus after a heavenly portent, see Anchises (2.637-50 and 687) and Aeneas (8.522 and 544). In his prophecy of Book I, Jupiter de- scribes Romulus as laetus when founding Rome (1.275); later in his vision of the pax Augusta he describes Romulus as giving laws alongside Remus (1.290-93). James O'Hara interprets this last phase as being deliberately mis- leading and undermining of idealistic claims; cf. Death and the Optimistic Prophecy in Vergil's Aeneid (1990) 4-5 and 151-53. T. P. Wiseman, by contrast, m Remus (Cambridge 1995) 145, describes the allusion to Quirinus and Remus as serving "the interests of peace, harmony and reconciliation" and as evoking images of Agrippa and Augustus sharing the burdens of lead- ership. 7 On two other occasions, Cacus is said to disgorge (uomo) fire from his mouth (8.252-53, 259). Other than these passages with Cacus, Augustus, and Aeneas in books 8 and 10, uomo is associated with fire in only one other in- stance (5.682).</page><page sequence="4">96 Stephen Scully huic monstro Volcanus erat pater: illius atros ore uomens ignis magna se mole ferebat. Aen. 8.198-99 Vulcan was the father of this monster; vomiting black fires from his mouth he bore himself in a mighty mass. As if to underscore the link between Augustus and the half-man, half-beast Cacus, the demon's "proud door jambs" decorated with severed human heads still dripping with blood remain in our minds when we hear that Vulcan sculpts on the shield an image of Augus- tus' "proud door jambs" at Rome freshly decorated with war booty from Actium (cf. foribus adfixa superbis , 8.196 and aptatque super- bis I postibus, 8.721-22). Unmistakable parallels of this kind may lead one to conclude that Rome is not so distant from her savage, spiritual foes as first imag- ined.8 For Michael Putnam, for example, "by the very power of its repetitiousness, [such language] not only subvert[s] idealism but of- ferts] itself as exemplification of history's reiterative tendencies."9 Over the past thirty years Putnam, with a bat's ear for such re- verberations, has masterfully revealed the lyric lament which under- scores the poem's epic grandeur. For him, Vergilian echo undermines Augustan propaganda, causing carefully built edifices to totter, as the poem exposes man's bestial nature underlying promises of civil- ity. Echoes by their nature, however, both resemble and differ from their source. Rather than seeing such repetition as subverting ideal- ism, we might understand it as suggesting conversion - as in the case of the bullocks sacrificed at Rome's altars, bloodshed persisting but redirected through ritual substitution and civic refinement. Ver- 8 For Cacus as an Etruscan benevolent seer, demonized by the Romans, espe- cially by Vergil, see J. P.

This is the second night scene of book 8, the first occurring at the beginning of the book when an anxious Aeneas is visited by the River God Tiber who confirms that Aeneas has come to the promised land. In the morning, he will sail up the river to the future site of Rome. The second night scene with its agitating eroticism will also lead to an image of Rome, on Vulcan's shield, culminating in Augustus' success at Actium. On the face of it such a night of sex would be an unlikely candidate for transformation and conversion as previously in the Aeneid the heat of amor has been linked persistently with irrationality, femininity, slavery, cru- elty, and deviation from pietas u But contrary to the flames of love which will burn Dido and eventually Carthage itself, the flames of lovemaking in book 8 will reappear as the fires used to craft Aeneas' armor, and later as the twin flames on Augustus' brow heralding Roman victory.12 10 Cf. Helen Bacon, "The Aeneid as a Drama of Election," ТАРА 116 (1986) 305-34 and Antonie Wlosok, Die Göttin Venus in Vergils Aeneis (Heidel- berg 1967), with whom Bacon has much in common. The association of amor with fire and city-destroying passions in the Aeneid has been discussed by many; for recent discussion, see Paul Allen Miller, "Sine deae seu sint dirae obscenaeque uolucres, " Arethusa 22 (1989) 47-79; Robin Mitchell, "The Violence of Virginity in the Aeneid Arethusa 24 (1991) 219-37; and the graceful comments of Christine Perkell, "On Creusa, Dido, and the Quality of Victory in Virgil's Aeneid in Helene Foley (ed.), Reflections of Women in Antiquity (New York 1981) 355-77. 12 In Binder's reading of the Shield (note 5 above, 150-282), each scene depicts an act of pietas overcoming a form of violence (furor) that threatens Rome. For Philip Hardie, Roman victories on the Shield are analogous to Olympian victories over chaos ( Virgil's Aeneid: Cosmos and Imperium [Oxford 1986] 336-76. Cf. Mario Di Cesare, The Altar and the City: A Reading of Vergil's Aeneid (New York 1974) 150-56; Antonie Wlosok (note 10 above) 128-38.</page><page sequence="6">98 Stephen Scully Like the flames from Augustus' brow and Aeneas' helmet, the erotic fires of this seduction are also associated with laeta, compli- cating our understanding of laetus: sensit laeta dolis et formae conscia coniunx Aen. 8.393 Delighting in her wiles and conscious of her beauty, the wife sensed [an object such as "her powers taking effect" must be understood]. On first reading, one may question whether Venus' delight in her sexual wiles has anything in common with the joy of Rome after Ac- tium, especially if we keep in mind that at Actium Augustus de- feated an Antony who had dangerously fallen sway to Cleopatra's female eroticism.13 Vergil, of course, models his Venus/Vulcan scene on Thetis' journey to Hephaistos in the Iliad to request arms for her son Achilles. But unlike Hephaistos who owes Thetis a favor and imme- diately complies with her wish, Vulcan hesitates, understandably so considering that Venus is his wife, pleading on behalf of a bastard son. His reluctance creates an unlikely scene, Venus being forced to resort to feminine wiles to get her way.14 The seduction which fol- For a more ironic reading, see Putnam (note 2 above) 148-62. Unlike Lu- cretius' portrait of Venus and Mars, in this scene Venus uses amor for the purposes of war. The Shield is both an instrument for war and a sign of Rome as a story of war. 13 Servius considers laeta to be Venus' personal epithet, the Vergilian equiva- lent of the philommeides Aphrodite in Homer and Hesiod. Her joy appears to stem more from her ancient cultic rites at Paphos than from her title as gene- trix, mother of Rome. Compare Venus' joyous spirit in Book I: "airborne (, sublimis ) [she] departed for Paphos and happy {laeta) returned to her own home where she has a temple and her hundred altars are ever warm with in- cense from Sheba and ever fragrant with freshly-gathered garlands" (1 .415-17). Compare her departure to Paphos once released from Hephaistos' chains ad Od. 8.362-63. Cf. Wlosok (note 10 above) 11-2, 95-7, 99 n. 108 and 145. Vergil's scene of conjugal love and deception also draws from Hera's seduc- tion of Zeus at Iliad 14.153-353; compare esp. 14.160 and 360 to Aeneid 8.393. For the Homeric scene, see Kenneth Atchity, Homer's Iliad: The Shield of Memory (Carbondale 1978) 102-10.</page><page sequence="7">Refining Fire in Aeneid 8 99 lows disturbed many readers in antiquity, Macrobius mentioning that its impropriety motivated Vergil's last-minute wish to have the whole poem burned.15 Aroused, Vulcan suddenly gives way: dixerat et niueis hinc atque hinc diua lacertis cunctantem amplexu molli fouet, ille repente accepit solitam flammam, notusque medullas intrauit calor et labefacta per ossa cucurrit. 8.387-90 The goddess had spoken and with her snow-white arms now this way and now that way she warms him, though he holds back, with her soft embrace. He all-at-once caught the famil- iar flame; the well-known heat penetrated his marrow and ran through his shaken bones. In composing this scene, Vergil turned to Lucretius and descriptions of unquenchable uoluptas: usque adeo cupide in Veneris compagibus haerent, membra uoluptatis dum ui labefacta liquescunt. DRN 4.1 113-14 So fettered in bonds of Venus, the lovers cling together in de- sire while their shaken members liquefy by the force of pleasure. Vergil may borrow from Lucretius' lexicon especially in the word labefacta, but his poetic technique differs considerably. The Lu- cretian passage is noteworthy for its alliteration of V's, L's, and T's in the second line and its compression and tensely -held equilibrium. The second line, in particular, strikes its balance by stationing the two nouns of the dum clause at the front end of the hexameter while the words of action, the participle and verb, placed at the end of the line work retroactively on membra , the line pivoting on the two 15 Macrobius, Sat. 1.24.6-7.</page><page sequence="8">100 Stephen Scully strong monosyllabic words dum and ui at the caesura in the third and fourth feet. Vergil's imitation moves in the opposite direction, away from compression to an intricate elaboration of pauses and enjamb- ments. This is the hottest eroticism in the Aeneid and deserves some at- tention. The sentence of 8.387-88 moves from a verb in the pluper- fect at the beginning of the line to the present tense at the end of the sentence which, ending as it does at the bucolic dieresis, adds special weight to fouet. Far from drawing attention to the rapidity of the se- duction as one commentary suggests,16 Vergil's language conveys sensuous foreplay: Venus' swan-like caresses in line 387, her snow-white arms moving first this way then that way over Vulcan's body, contrast with the slow spondees at the beginning of line 388 only to give way to quickened dactyls by the line's end. Corre- sponding to the shift to dactyls is the cinematic shift of subject from Venus to ille before Vulcan's sudden falling victim to passion's fa- miliar flame in the next line. The rhyming three -am syllables in 389 draw attention to solitam flammam, conveying a sense of Venus' soft binding touch. The subject shifts again, to calor, as we seem to move inside Vulcan's skin, the restraints of grammar giving way as the lover promises to do whatever his fires and bellows-blasts have the strength to do. But to anticipate my argument, language that here imagistically describes the foreplay that leads to melting lovemaking will soon describe the actual melting metals used to make the shield in the scene to come. But before that Vergil discreetly hints at intercourse that leads to orgasm:17 16 See Eden (note 5 above) ad 8.219 f; but he speaks particularly well about these lines ad 8.388 and 8.389. 17 While coniugis infusus gremio is not an explicit reference to orgasm, it may be inferred; cf. H. D. Jocelyn in "Cicero, Philippic 12.24 and the uses of grémium in classical Latin," LCM 9 (1984), who argues that this is the first time in Latin when grémium suggests intercourse involving human anatomy (20-21). For another example of coarse talk in the Aeneid , see R. O. A. M. Lyne, Words and the Poet (Oxford 1989) 33-36.</page><page sequence="9">Refining Fire in Aeneid 8 101 ea uerba locutus optatos dedit amplexus placidumque petiuit coniugis infusus gremio per membra soporem. Aen. 8.404-6 Having spoken these words [Vulcan] gave the desired em- braces and having poured himself out on his wife's lap he sought restful sleep throughout his limbs. Flustered by these lines, Valerius Probus proposed changing the case of the offending word infusus to the accusative so that it might mod- ify sleep: "on his wife's bosom he sought for his limbs restful sleep, which poured over him". 18 In painting this scene, Vergil also draws from another Lucretian passage, this time Venus' famous seduction of Mars at the opening of the De Rerum Natura. But in doing so Vergil changes Lucretius' aeterno deuictus uulnere amoris, Mars "utterly conquered by the everlasting wound of love" (1.34) to aeterno deuinctus amore, Vul- can "utterly bound by everlasting love" (8.394). Rather than the Lu- cretian goddess of creation who, if only temporarily, conquers the destructive war-god and seeks "quiet peace" for Rome ( DRN 1 .40), Vergil's Venus of book 8, more a figure of Roman history and the gens Iulia than of universal uoluptas, seeks Roman domination, em- ploys erotic powers for war, and will herself join arms with Mars in the climactic scene on the Shield.19 Vergilian reference to Lucretius' Venus/Mars affair further com- plicates the reading of this scene, as marital eroticism must now also be read in the context of adultery. Nowhere in the Aeneid does Vergil make overt reference to Venus' infidelities; even explicit reference to her dalliance with Anchises is passed over, discreetly some might 18 Prior to Probus, Annaeus Cornutus was concerned by the possible double meaning of membra. On the other hand, Aulus Gellius (9.10) agrees with Annianus, a "neoteric" of Hadrian's period, that Vergilian description of sex- ual intercourse here is to be praised for its modest paraphrase; cf. Eden (note 5 above) ad 8.388 and 8.405 f. 19 Cf. 8.699-701. Cf. Kenneth Reckford, "Recognizing Venus (i): Aeneas Meets his Mother," Arion 3 (1995) 32-35. See also note 12 above.</page><page sequence="10">102 Stephen Scully say.20 But here at the most delicate of moments those references come in through a side door. In choosing deuinctus for deuictus Vergil loses Lucretius' witty martial metaphor of the war-god conquered by love but he gains a joke of his own. While deuinctus describing people who are legally, morally, or emotionally bound to one an- other may hint superficially at an eroticism between husband and wife, it also plays off Homer's version of the Aphrodite/Ares affair where the cuckolded Hephaistos shackles the nude couple in his bed. In Vergilian reversal, the craftsman is himself shackled amusingly by love's power.21 After love-making, Vergil's Vulcan "seeks soothing sleep" (8.405-6), but we as readers cannot help but think of the crippled smith inspired by his wife's sexuality not to craft arms but to snare a faithless Venus. The range of scholarly opinion about this bedroom scene indi- cates its difficulty for interpretation. In what is in many other ways a remarkable and elegant essay, Helen Bacon's characterization of this bedroom scene must be questioned: "Passion in the context of conjugal love and pietas. "22 Such a reading ignores deliberate Lu- cretian echoes to Venus' affair with Mars as well as Venus' efforts on behalf of a bastard son.23 Servius, sufficiently bothered by this last point, felt compelled to repunctuate the text at 8.383 so that what reads arma rogo gene- trix nato ("I ask for arms, a mother for her son") becomes in Servius, 20 Cf. Wlosok (note 10 above) 98 n. 105; but see Grandsen (note 5 above) 41. 21 Cf. R. O. A. M. Lyne, Further Voices in Vergil's Aeneid (Oxford 1987) 41. 22 Bacon (note 10 above) 333. Although she underplays the troubling associa- tions of this episode, I agree with her that Venus' love-making must ulti- mately be seen in the context of a procreative cosmic force. Wlosok (note 10 above, passim, esp. 115 and 145-46) is oddly quiet about this scene when arguing that love and the love goddess have been transformed in the second half of the Aeneid. For Hellenistic echoes, see Gordon Williams, Technique and Ideas in the Aeneid (New Haven 1983) 126. 23 So Montaigne clearly felt. Citing Aeneid 8.387-92 and 404-6, lines which he felt captured the spirit of love more than "l'amour mesme," he wrote: "Ce que j'y trouve à considérer, c'est qu'il la peinct un peu bien esmeue pour une Vénus maritale." Linking Venus' seduction of Vulcan in Vergil with her tam- ing of Mars in Lucretius, Montaigne praises the Romans and their language for a ravishing vigor which he laments is absent in French; see "Sur des vers de Virgile" (3:5), Maurice Rat (ed.) Essais de Montaigne, vol. 2 (Paris 1962) 272, 273, 300, 301, respectively.</page><page sequence="11">Refining Fire in Aeneid 8 103 "I ask for arms. A mother, the daughter of Nereus [Thetis], for her son was able to move you with tears...." Venus' delight in trading sex for favors and pleasure in her feminine tricks suggests more the manner of a meretrix, scortum, or domina from Latin elegy, than a sober duty-bound Romana matrona, especially if we keep in mind Lucretius' statement that Roman wives were not meant to move or provide passion in intercourse.24 Throughout the poem Vergil's por- trayal of Venus conforms with contemporary views of sexuality as a dangerous intoxicant which leads to furor and a hero's fall to tempta- tion.25 For those of pious mind who want the Aeneid to march lockstep toward a morally superior political order, this scene is something of an embarrassment. "The spectacle of an adulterous beauty-queen calculatingly turning her charms on a long-suffering husband... gravely detracts from the seriousness of the surrounding narrative," one writer worries, concerned that "the lofty seriousness of the theodicy [is]... dangerously undermined by the anthropomorphic realism" of scenes like this.26 Such allusions to adultery and sexual play would fit awkwardly with Augustan moral legislation, or to the image of Venus Genetrix, whose temple Julius Caesar built in the 24 Cf. DRN 4.1268-74 and Propertius 4.7.16, a point of view, incidentally, shared by Montaigne (3:5, 273-77). On Lucretius, see R. O. A. M. Lyne, The Latin Love Poets from Catullus to Horace (Oxford 1980) 3. 25 Consider Lucretius (DRN 4.1 1 15-17): "At last when the desire collected in the groin has spent itself, there is a temporary respite from the raging fever ( ardoris uiolenti ). Soon the same frenzy (rabies) returns and that furor revis- its," lines which immediately follow those that Vergil adapted at 8.390: "heat entered (the marrow) and ran through his shaken bones." Cf. Steven Farron, Vergil's Aeneid: A Poem of Grief and Love, Mnemosyne Suppl. 122 (Leiden 1993) 81-91 and 124^0, speaking primarily about the Ni- sus-Euryalus and Dido- A eneas episodes.

Aspects of comedy are certainly present: the hapless husband unable to withstand Venus' seduction and the contrast between a devoted, subordinate Vulcan and his dominant, unchaste wife par- ticularly strike some modern readers as funny. Irony is also to be found in narrative arrangement: the heated pleasure and opulence in Vulcan's golden bed-chamber (8.372) follow strikingly upon the story of Evander' s humble virtues, models of Stoic fortitude and re- straint in the pre-Roman Pallanteum. For R. O. A. M. Lyne, the im- plications of that juxtaposition are instructive: "a further voice is speaking to us,"28 reminding us how "unfair" it is for immoral gods to prohibit humans from indulging in similar pleasures. For Lyne, further memory of Venus' heartless and dangerous seduction of Dido, also victimized by Venus' "tricks" (dolis) and "bound in flame" (1.673-74), makes it "quite clear that Vergil is not fond of this goddess."29 But is this scene only funny and subversive, joined to its neigh- boring scenes by nothing more than ironic juxtaposition? Verbal ech- oes suggest more complex links. The conversion of flamma, almost instantaneously, from the metaphoric fires of sexual passion to the literal fires of Vulcan's smithy (8.421), suggests a linkage between the love-making and the shield-making, a linkage made admittedly with some humor in the simile comparing the Vulcan who arises from his amorous bed to a working woman who strives to keep her husband's bed chaste and raise their young sons. Like the smith, she 27 For this aggressive, if problematic, policy, see P.

The simile makes light of the once and future cuckolded husband who is here playing the female, keeping chaste a bed forever unchaste. But there is also another dimension to the simile, a further voice if you will, in the verbal transformation of venereal pleasures giving way to ars. At the smithy, the craftsman is no longer the victim of sexual flames but he is ignipotens, "the worker of fire" (8.414 and 423), the epithet by which Vulcan will be repeatedly identified in the shield ekphrasis,30 and he is shaper of metal "by the help of art" (arte magistra 8.442). Venus will mention this ars with pride when she presents Vulcan's arms to Aeneas (8.612). At Vulcan's forge on Vulcania, an island linked by underground caverns to Mt. Etna, the smith-god comes upon his Cyclopes hard at work. Their industry suggests a kind of sexual energy displaced: ualidique incudibus ictus / auditi referunt gemitus...et fornacibus ig- nis anhelat , "hard blows are heard on the anvils and re-echo their groans... and the fire pants in the furnaces" (8.419-21). As Eden points out, the groans are of course inanimate.31 Once figures of re- bellion and imprisoned by Jupiter under Mt. Etna (3.578 ff), the Cyclopes make Jupiter's thunderbolts, under Vulcan's command their once-savage energy channeled into creative action. Vergil writes: "With a few words Vulcan has all the Cyclopes set to their work with speed and spread out their labor with equal division. Bronze flows in rivers of metal and gold and the deadly steel melts ( liquescit ) in the vast furnace, as they fashioned a shield of immense size" (8.443-47). In shield-making, the Cyclopes and fire are seen har- nessed into patterns of order. This transformation of fire continues when the craftsman's flames reappear as the flames of divine omen vomiting forth from Aeneas' new helmet (already noted, 8.620) and from Octavian' s joyous brow at Actium (8.680-81). The narrative movement from love-making to shield-making to the shield, re-enforced by verbal echoes, suggests a process of con- 30 This is the first use of ignipotens in extant Latin.

This victory is even more poignant in the context of the shield's ori- gins if we think of Octavian at Actium as a Roman male leader de- feating a barbarian queen who has given way to sexual passions. The curious hypallage of laeta with Octavian' s temples and the flammae vomiting forth from them marks a displacement from the passion of love-making to the victory of fatum at Actium, sexuality engendering an image which celebrates victory over base, culture-destroying fe- male eroticism. Such narrative movement suggests the essential am- biguity of passion within the context of culture: sexual energies, on the one hand, as Lucretian echoes in book 8 suggest, cannot easily be contained within the confines of marriage, but they set in motion a process leading to Roman laetitia, generating the Shield with its story "of Italy and the triumph of Rome" (8.626). The wild and heroic context of sexuality in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite offers a telling comparison of eros which occurs outside the confines of the polis but is germane to the city's future. The en- counter between goddess and mortal on the slopes of Mt. Ida and their love-making on the skins of bears and lions slain by Anchises in the hunt {Hymn 5.158-60) create an ambiance totally different from the opulent setting in the Aeneid where Venus comes to Vulcan's golden marriage chamber (8.372), but their union on the mountain slopes will result in an offspring who, journeying to the city after being raised by mountain nymphs, will rule the Trojans and secure the city's longevity by providing a line of descendants without end С Hymn 5.196-97). The particular burden of Venus' and Vulcan's marriage plays into this story of conversion. Unlike all other Olympian marriages, this one is notorious for being sterile, its infertility even more strik- ing in light of Venus' tendency to become pregnant in her many af- fairs. Her romance with Mars resulted in a number of offspring, in- cluding Harmonia. Her dalliance with Neptune, in gratitude for his coming to her defense when caught in Vulcan's golden net, produced two children. Pleased by Mercury's admiration for her in that same scene, she dallied once again, an interlude resulting in the birth of</page><page sequence="15">Refining Fire in Aeneid 8 107 Hermaphrodite. Her one afternoon with Anchises led to the birth of Aeneas, so named because of her dread (ainos) in having slept with a mortal. Vulcan also is sexually potent outside the marriage, as we learn earlier in this book of the Aeneid when the fire-god is credited with fathering Cacus (8.198). But the union of Venus and Vulcan is barren, perhaps not a surprising fact considering their incompatible natures: a marriage of the deformed and the beautiful, of the slow and swift, of craft and passion. Yet as Vulcan is about to make love to his wife he is called pater without further elaboration (8.394), and Venus is prompted to call him pater sixty lines later as he is busy preparing the arms for her son (8.454). At the same time Venus is called mater as she prepares to seduce her husband (8.370) and more pointedly she becomes the diua creatrix, "the divine mother" (8.534), as Aeneas anticipates the arrival of Vulcan's Shield.32 Modern commentators are quick to pass over these honorific titles, especially in reference to Vulcan, citing similar terminology elsewhere in Vergil's works. But it should be noted that when Vergil uses pater by itself for a god, as he does here for Vulcan, he usually means Jupiter.33 These honorific titles may not be so neutral if we consider the couple's lovemaking in this case as fecund, resulting not in a physical son but in an abstraction of the world order, the Shield as progeny. Their offspring could then be considered a transmutation of love's primary and passionate nature from its biological origins to cultural artifact. A similar change appears in Venus herself, from the seductress who entices Vulcan by night (cf. amplexu molli, 8.387), to the ethe- real goddess who descends in bright light with Vulcan's gifts to em- brace her son (cf. amplexus nati, 8.615), to the Venus who plays a central role at Actium, poised between Neptune and Minerva united in their defeat of Egyptian beast-gods (8.699).34 Seduction can never 32 A phrase used only here and ad Aen. 6.367. 33 Cf. Servius, ad Geo. 2.4; cf. Grandsen (note 5 above) ad 8.394 and Eden (note 5 above) ad 8.72. For Susan Wiltshire, Public and Private in Vergil's Aeneid (Amherst 1989) 113, the epithet pater at 8.394 is "highly unfortunate under the circumstances." 34 For the historical relevance of these three Olympians (former enemies at Troy but united at Rome) on the Shield (8.699), see Binder (note 5 above) 242 ff</page><page sequence="16">108 Stephen Scully be absent from Venus' actions, especially when touch is involved; so sexual undertones may be present in her reaching for Aeneas but this embrace looks beyond the seduction earlier in book 8 to the many failed embraces that have tormented Aeneas since leaving Troy.35 The most notable of these, perhaps, is the hero's desire to embrace his father in the Underworld, a joy made impossible by the rules governing the dead (6.697-702; cf. 5.740^2). The same laws pre- vented Aeneas from embracing Creusa in book 2 (790-94). Venus' refusal to take Aeneas in her arms in book 1 (405-10) is never ex- plained but it clearly serves as a foil for this moment - one which she initiates and the only embrace between a god and a mortal in the poem. More than sexual seduction, it confirms a refocus in Aeneas, willing now to embrace his duty and the non enarrabile textům (8.625), the ineffable fabric of history, a son who sees himself less in terms of his mortal father and Troy and more in terms of a divine mother and Olympian mission. Venus' embrace may be read then as a physical sign that he "has won," in Helen Bacon's phrasing, "the privilege of crossing the impassable barrier that separates gods and mortals."36 Ill The themes of eroticism and sublimation in book 8 play off similar themes in book 4, especially in Aeneas' fumbling and legalistic ef- forts to free himself from Dido. When trying to convey to his be- loved that he is called to Italy by a different love ( hie amor, haec Less noble spirits frequently associated with civil war at Actium aid Augus- tus: Mars, who rages (saeuit)' the grim Dirae from heaven; joyous ( gaudens ) Discordia; Bellona with blood-stained whip (8.700-3). At the end of the poem Jupiter will employ one of the Dirae (ab aethere, 12.853) to carry out his final design. Cf. Elizabeth Belfiore, " Ter Frustra Comprensa: Embraces in the Aeneid Phoenix 38 (1984) 19-30; Bacon (note 10 above) 308; Wlosok (note 10 above) 86-88 and 1 10-12; Di Cesare (note 12 abbove) 233-39. 36 Bacon (note 10 above) 334; cf. Wlosok (note 10 above) 144. Miller (note 11 above, 54) overlooks this embrace when he writes that goddesses in the Aeneid "are not able to be touched by men." For the four instances when gods in the poem appear to a mortal in their own forms, see J. Jones, "Aeneid 4.238-278 and the Persistence of an Allegorical Interpretation," Ver- gilius 33 (1987) 29-37.</page><page sequence="17">Refining Fire in Aeneid 8 109 patria est , 4.347), he must press care under his heart {curam sub corde premebat , 4.332) and hold his eyes unmoved ( immota , 4.331) when speaking to her: If fate had permitted me to lead my life by my own lights, and spontaneously to compose my cares, I should first of all rebuild the city of Troy and the Sweet remains of my people. Priam's great hall Should stand again. . . . But now it is great Italy That Apollo tells me I must seek after: Italy The oracles order me to seize. There is my love; There is my country. 4.340-47 (after Fitzgerald) As Rome is yet without a name, it is not possible for Aeneas to paraphrase that palindrome, made famous from a graffito at Pompeii, where roma and amor form a four-sided figure much like a military camp or stylized urbs: AMOR M О О M ROMA But by having Aeneas say hie amor , haee patria est, Vergil's readers can think of Roma in the context of this amor and draw a contrast between Aeneas' physical love of Dido and a love of something which is without a body or face, which is as yet unfounded and de- fined by loss. To embrace that love, Aeneas must keep himself unmoved, a point made not only at 4.331-32 but again a hundred lines later when he again must weather Dido's pleas: "The trunk shakes and leaves strew the ground, yet the tree grips among the rocks below; its roots stretch as far down towards the abyss as its crest reaches up to the heavens. Deeply his brave heart grieved, but his will re- mained unshaken. Tears roll down, but without effect" ( mens im- mota manet, lacrimae uoluuntur inanes 4.44 1 - 49). Aeneas' mind remains firm, but Vergil skillfully does not specify whose tears fall. Are they Aeneas', Dido's, Anna's? All have been suggested since</page><page sequence="18">110 Stephen Scully antiquity, but they could just as easily be those of Vergil's reader sensing how this new form of amor necessitates a pressing down of personal desire and how pietas may necessitate a stunted humanity, requiring the conquering of love and pity but not of furor.37 By book 8 the psychology of the poem appears to have taken a new turn. The image is less of pressing down and psychic steadfast- ness than of redirection. The hesitant Vulcan is moved by passion to employ his craft in the service of destiny. In book 3, the seditious Giant Enceladus is crushed beneath the mass of Mt. Etna which, breathing flame from its bursting furnaces, is heavily imposed upon him (3.578-80), 38 but in book 8 Vulcan has harnessed the chthonic Cyclopes in the service of Zeus. Now the once monstrous creatures work the fires in their underground forge, "mixing in terrifying flashes, crashings, dread, and wrath {iras) wrapped in pursuing flames" (8.431-32), to make the Olympian's lightning bolts. Vulcan himself has moved under the influence of Venus from the figure who fathered the monstrous Cacus to the maker of the Shield. At the end of book 8, far from pressing down his desires, Aeneas freely marvels at things unknown and delights in representation ( imagine gaudet, 8.730). In book 6, a son's love ( amor menti) and great desire (tanto cupido) to be near his father's side, and not curiosity about a future Rome, compelled Aeneas to enter the Underworld (6.133), but now images of future fame and his heir's destiny (famamque et fata nepotum, 8.731) move the hero.39 There are many reasons for these changes in psychological orientation; prominent among them is the capacity of envisioning natural and potentially destructive powers being absorbed and converted into civilizing energies. IV Warfare in the last books of the Aeneid accentuates ambiguity and contradiction to a much greater extent than the drama of election in 37 Cf. W. R. Johnson, "Aeneas and the Ironies of Pietas," CJ 60 (1965) 360- 62; and Perke 11 (note 1 1 above) 370. 38 Cf. 1.56-63, 1.293-96, 6.548-83, and 1.208-9 as a psychological parallel. 39 Throughout the second half, the epic sees the necessity of saeuitia to over- come saeuitia, the prime example being Hercules' defeat of Cacus (8.184- 279). For the linking of fama and fata, see 7.79.</page><page sequence="19">Refining Fire in Aeneid 8 111 book 8, suggesting that models of sublimation and transmutation are far from the final word in the poem. In the battle scenes of books 1 1 and 12, only Aeneas will be called saeuissimus (10.878), an epithet that he shares alone with Juno (2.612). By the poem's end, he more than Turnus will be associated with saeuitia, a savagery which reaches its fever pitch when Aeneas drinks in the sight of Pallas' belt, "a reminder of savage grief {saeui monimenta doloris, 12.945)." Verbal echoes link Aeneas' fiery fury (furiis accensus and feruidus, 12.946 and 951) at the end of the poem to Hercules' fiery rage when combating Cacus (cf. furiis exarserat and feruidus ira , 8.219 and 230). But comparison of their civilizing violence only highlights the contrast between Aeneas and Hercules. Unlike Cacus, Turnus at the end of the poem has turned suppliant and Aeneas in killing him vio- lates Anchises' call for Roman dementia for the subdued (6.851-53), raising the question whether the poem has progressed far from its beginnings in Juno's motivating savagery. By the choice of verb to describe Aeneas' planting of the sword under the Turnus' heart, fer- rum aduerso sub pectore condit feruidus , 12.950-51), condere used "to found or build a city" as well as "to plant or hide a sword," Ver- gil reminds us that culture originates in sacrifice and violence. As the echoes between Aeneas, Augustus, and Cacus also imply, humans in the Aeneid never completely shed traces of their violent selves. From Anchises' description in book 6 of the purification of souls we might infer that those traces stem from the mixing of the mens with mortal bodies. Only the rarest of souls, he says, purified over time, some by being hanged in the air and exposed to the blasts of inanes uentos, others washed in a vast whirlpool, and still others cauterized by fire (6.740-42), are left with nothing but "pure, ethe- real sentience and the fire of unmixed air" ( durumque relinquit / aetherium sensum atque aurai simplicis ignem, 6.746-47). Unlike the purified souls in Eclogue 4 which will replace a race of iron with one of gold when the new-born child descends from heaven {Eel 4.6-10), however, the purified souls of Aeneid 6 will never return to earth once cleansed. In the restored Saturnian age of Eclogue 4 "if any traces of our crime ( sceleris uestigia nostri ) remain, they will become void ( inrita ) and free the earth of its perpetual terror" {per- petua soluent formidine terras, 4.13-14). But in the Aeneid ,</page><page sequence="20">112 Stephen Scully earth-bound souls must by nature be "slowed by injurious bodies, made dull by earthen limbs and dying flesh" (noxia corpora tardant / terrenique hebetant artus moribundaque membra, 6.731-32). Such blunted souls, Anchises goes on to say, are encased in a blind dark prison, insentient of the purifying breezes above. Far from having traces of their mortal crimes made void, these souls are tainted by the false emotions of fear, desire, grief, and rejoicing (6.733-34).40 Later, Dante will try to complete a spiritual cleansing in the pil- grim's vision of the Divine, as perhaps also imagined in the messi- anic vision of the Fourth Eclogue, but in the Aeneid no fire can fully refine earth-born souls. That limitation does not reduce the visionary power of the Aeneid. It is as much a poem of the spirit as of the body, but it does place Rome within the context of humans with dulled souls, the city necessarily imagined as a place more of possi- bility or of dream than of full enactment. Such refinement is under- stood less in terms of purgation, the self cleansed of past crimes, than of transformation and of redirection, with traces of irrationality, bestial violence, and passion transmuted. The lost golden age of Sat- urn which once graced Italian soil gave way to a discolored age of more base metal (cf. deterior donee paulatim ac decolor aetas, 8.324-27), but Augustus, diui genus, will bring back a golden age of sorts (cf. 6.791-94), albeit one constrained by laws and force. If read figuratively the ekphrasis of Actium as bronze fleets within a sea of gold suggests something of that ambiguity, Rome as an alloy: an en- visioned golden age intermixed with elements of lower nature. Vul- can's image of Rome, far from depicting a city free of old crimes, portrays rather, in Bacon's words, "the struggle of pietas and furor at successive stages of the city's development... a reminder that this struggle, this labor, is never finished in this world."41 40 For Platonic elements in Anchises' views, see Richard Tarrant, "Aeneas and the Gates of Sleep," CP 11 (1982) 51-55; work which influenced Denis Feeney, "History and Revelation in Vergil's Underworld, PCPS 212 (1986) 1-24, the latter criticized by Thomas Habinek, "Science and Tradition in Aeneid 6," HSCP 92 (1989) 224-25 and James Zetzel, " Romane Memento: Justice and Judgment in Aeneid 6," ТАРА 119 (1989) 274-76 and 282.

It is characteristic of this sophisticated poem that its hero should emerge from the Elysium fields through the gate of false dreams, as if limitations imposed by man's corporeal nature falsify the dream of Rome. Seeing Aeneas' exit in light of man's im- prisoned soul while not losing sight of the purer world of which this physical realm is mere shadow, Richard Tarrant has expressed well this kind of dream "alloy:" "the mission of Aeneas [and by extension Rome through law and its own use of violence] will have a perma- nent and beneficent influence on human history" even as the poem exposes the reader to "the evanescence of mortal aspirations."42 Much contemporary debate about the Aeneid turns on differing interpretations of these persistent traces, with Vergil frequently cast as a poet helpless to withstand his own darker inklings about the project of impérium. The poetic force of the Aeneid lies in refusing to exclude residues from earlier stages of the passions while retaining an image of baser metals refined. Vergil provides glimpses into a process that later poets will more fully dream on.43 Boston University 42 Tarrant (note 40 above) 54 and Zetzel (note 40 above) 282, who see the traits which Anchises attributes to human existence amply exemplified in the pa- rade of future Roman heroes, Elysian souls fated to be earthbound. 1 wish to thank audiences at St. Johns College in Annapolis and the Roman Studies Conference at Boston University (1997) where earlier versions of this paper were presented, and the referees of this journal for their extremely in- sightful comments and suggestions regarding this paper.</page></plain_text>
