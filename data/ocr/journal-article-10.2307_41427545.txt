Thus, Gerald Prince's "Introduction to the Study of the Narratee" and Mary Ann Piwowarczyk's "The Narratee and the Situation of Enunciation: A Reconsideration of Prince's Theory" remain basic expositions of its properties and functions. Seminal as these studies were at the time of their publication, they have basically an intro- ductory character and the ideas presented in them need to be augmented and developed, not least because they do not take into account the speci- ficity of more experimental narrative forms, second-person narratives in particular, which have gained in significance since the 1970s. The aim of the present study is to fill in this lacuna in narrative poetics and to propose a typology which would allow a systematic presentation of different types of narratees identifiable in various narrative forms. Incorporating Prince's introductory remarks into a global model of nar- rative communication, Seymour Chatman's classic diagram (151) identi- fying the narratee, the implied reader and the real reader on the reception side has come to constitute a reference point for further research on the narratee. In his diagram Chatman situates the real reader outside textual communication and assumes the immanence of the implied reader and the JNT: Journal of Narrative Theory 41.2 (Summer 2011): 253-281. Copyright © 2011 by J NT: Journal of Narrative Theory.</page><page sequence="2">254 J N T consequent optionality of the narratee, whose presence is dependent on textual signals. Most subsequent discussions of the narratee focus almost exclusively, if not excessively, on the issue of his/her1 intrinsic position in the text structure and, as might be expected, advocate all logically possible modifications of Chatman's original diagram. Whether the narratee is considered an intrinsic textual element seems to depend on two factors: the assumption of a particular overall model of narrative communication and the adoption of a deductive approach to nar- rative as such. Thus, Gerard Genette (138) and Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan (89) exclude the implied reader from narrative communication and argue for the narratee's immanence on the strength of an a priori assumption that a narrative must be directed to some textualised addressee other than the real reader. Patrick O'Neill (71) and William Nelles (9), in turn, main- tain that the communicative structure of each and every narrative com- prises both the narratee and the implied reader on its reception side, their working assumption being that both the implied author and the narrator, whose immanence they assume, need communicative partners, i.e. the im- plied reader and the narratee. Neatly ordered as these models of narrative communication are, they seem too rigid to do justice to the complexities of narrative fiction. As Brian Richardson (114-133) has demonstrated re- cently, such symmetrical theoretical distinctions frequently collapse when they are applied to particular - not necessarily extremely experimental - instances of narratives. Furthermore, a peculiar regularity can be observed in studies arguing for the immanence of the narratee. Once his/her presence has been proved deductively, examples of texts in which the narratee can be identified are adduced: they usually include such novels as Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy , Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness or Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. Naturally, what these texts have in common is that they explicitly introduce the figure of an addressee to whom the narrator is directing his/her narrative. One would be hard put to find a general discussion of the narratee which relies on texts in which he/she is not explicitly evoked. As might be expected, the few existing studies of the narratee in particular novels also analyse texts in which the narratee is explicitly evoked. An exception to this focusing on clearly visible figures of a textualised addressee is constituted by Prince's discussion of what he considers indi- rect signals of the narratee's presence in the text. He quotes a passage</page><page sequence="3">From Zero to Hero 255 from Gustave Flaubert's Un Coeur simple, in which the narrator identifies the individuals whose names he mentions - "Robelin, the farmer from Ge- offosses . . . Liébard, the farmer from Touques ... M. Bourais, a former lawyer" (Prince, "Introduction" 17) - and concludes that this passage sig- nals the narratee's presence, since it cannot be for him/herself that the nar- rator identifies these people. Prince's argumentation does not seem com- pletely convincing, though. For one thing, the question of the narrator's motivation is highly contentious: one might perversely argue that the nar- rator needs to remind him/herself who is who. Furthermore, seen from the perspective adopted by Prince in his discussion of this passage, almost every single bit of any narrative would indicate the narratee's presence, as it might always be argued that the narrator is not narrating for him/herself. More importantly perhaps, while Prince enumerates a number of textual functions attributable to explicitly evoked narratees, he does not really demonstrate that the category of the narratee is needed in the interpreta- tion of Un Coeur simple or that in this case it can and should be distin- guished from the category of the virtual reader (Prince's term for the im- plied reader). The manner in which the category of the narratee has been so far em- ployed in narratological theory and practice suggests that it can be limited to addressees who are explicitly evoked in a given narrative. The narratee thus understood can be distinguished from the implied reader construed as the model of a possible reader which the implied author (rather than an elusive real author or a hypostatised text) projects and on which he/she re- lies in his/her strategies. They may include, among other things, the con- struction of an explicit communicative situation involving the presence of the narrator and of the narratee. The framework for the study of the narratee sketched above can be un- derstood as an attempt to reconcile two approaches to narrative communi- cation identified by Harry E. Shaw. The assumption that the category of the narratee should be limited to the realm of textual signals ties in with what he has dubbed the "information" approach to narrative. The idea of the implied reader being projected by the implied author would, in turn, be closer to the "rhetorical" approach to the narrative. While in the theoreti- cal section of his article Shaw contends that the categories of the narratee and the implied reader cannot and need not be clearly demarcated in the "rhetorical" approach, his own example seems to rely implicitly on the</page><page sequence="4">256 J N T differentiation between the narratee and the implied reader suggested above. Having proposed that the narratee might simply be construed as "a figure the narrator has in mind in telling the story," he describes the "mothers of America" addressed in Stowe's Uncle Tom 's Cabin as "a (col- lective) narratee" and proceeds to enumerate possible effects the figure thus evoked might have on the readers Stowe "actually wishes to address" (Shaw 302-303). While Shaw is right in pointing out that Stowe might have been trying to reach simultaneously disparate types of audience, his example does not really prove that the category of the narratee should not be limited to the addressees directly evoked in the text: after all, the "mothers of America" are precisely addressees of this type. As for the au- dience Stowe "actually wishes to address," it seems that the category of the implied reader is more appropriate as it emphasises that we are talking about the audience the author, not the narrator, assumes. Naturally, the fact that the categories of narratee and implied reader can thus be differentiated does not mean that the relationship between the two is always easy to de- scribe or that a single text cannot evoke more than one narratee or implied reader. Most studies in narrative communication point out that the narratees vary from hardly visible anonymous addressees to fully-fledged fictional characters. In other words, the narratee can be concretised to a greater or lesser degree on the level of the presented world, depending on the quality and quantity of signals evoking his/her presence. Thus, utilising concréti- sation as a gradable criterion we can distinguish three major categories of narratees: the potential reader/listener at its minimum extreme, the charac- ter in the middle of the scale, and the protagonist at the maximum ex- treme. The borders between these major types of the narratee are not im- passable: intermediary categories between the narratee-potential-reader/ listener and the narratee-character or between the narratee-character and the narratee-protagonist can and should be distinguished. By the same token, within each of the major categories sub-divisions according to the degree of concrétisation are possible, even necessary. Categories and sub- categories of narratee thus distinguished are discussed in more detail in successive sections of my essay, their sequence reflecting the increase in concrétisation. The examples employed to illustrate my categorisation of the narratee come from modern novels and short stories in English: the figure of a textualised addressee is evoked in a great number of them and</page><page sequence="5">From Zero to Hero 257 consequently they seem to provide a sufficient range of examples. For easy reference the positions of the narratees of the texts under discussion in relation to concrétisation are schematically presented in the diagram. It comprises not only major types of the narratee, distinguished above, but also sub-categories identifiable within or in-between the major categories. The arrow denotes an increase in concrétisation; its circular form, in turn, indicates that - as I shall argue - in the case of the narratee's concrétisa- tion the paradoxical rule of the meeting of extremes applies: the narratee who is apparently most concretised may be similar to the narratee who is least concretised. The narratee-potential-reader/listener The term narratee-potential-reader/listener, designating the least con- cretised category of the narratee, reflects two basic aspects of this type of intratextual addressee. The word potential highlights the fact that it refers to the narrator's projection of a possible receiver of his/her narrative, not any particular individual. Deprived of a proper name or such properties as gender, age or past, he/she does not exist as a separate character on the level of the presented world; he/she is simply an element of the narrator's discourse, evoked by means of the second-person pronoun. Writing and speaking being two basic forms of verbal communication, the phrase reader/listener points to two basic roles which this potential ad- dressee can be assigned. On the one hand, the narrator can self-con- sciously identify him/herself as the person writing the text and thus cast the narratee in the role of a potential reader. On the other hand, a given narrative - rather than a narrator, who is frequently unaware of his/her own function - can create the illusion of an oral exchange involving a nar- rator and somebody listening to him/her - a potential listener. Both Prince and Piwowarczyk identify direct address as the basic tech- nique whereby the narratee is evoked and highlight the use of second-per- son forms as an obvious indication of the narratee's presence in the com- municative structure of a given narrative (Prince, "Introduction" 13; Piwowarczyk 174). Indeed, this device is most common in the case of the narratee-potential-reader/listener; however, the employment of second-per- son forms is not in itself equivalent to the evocation of the narratee. For the communicative frame to be established, the narrator must use you2 specif-</page><page sequence="6">258 J N T ically as the pronoun of address in relation to a receiver of his/her narra- tive, which is not always the case. You is a multifunctional pronoun and can, for instance, be employed as a generic pronoun, a colloquial equiva- lent of an impersonal one (Bonheim, "Narration" 70; Herman 380-81). Thus, it performs an evocative function only when it appears in the context of expressions whose structure presupposes the presence of an ad- dressee to whom they are directed. The vocative and imperative are two obvious grammatical forms which manifest this address function, but it can also appear in other types of sentences, such as affirmatives or inter- rogatives. Consequently, the address function cannot be correlated with any particular syntactic representation. Consider the following list, which is by no means exhaustive, of the forms in which it can be identified: (1) (em)phatic formulaic insertions: I really didn't need that, I tell you , with my head and face and back and heart hurting a lot all the time anyway, and still drunk and crazed and ghosted from the planet. (Amis 1) (2) questions: Did you know that since 1973 the principal reason for men divorcing women in English courts of law was because of the adultery of the wife? (Barnes 191) (3) projections of possible objections: You may still insist that effective sexual passion is missing. You may present his naked five-year-old body to prove your argument. (Berger 40) (4) introductory phrases: But you will no doubt agree that the very best plans are those which give clear margins of error . . . (Ishiguro 9)3 Representative of the techniques whereby the narratee-potential- reader/listener is evoked, the passages quoted above reveal basic proper-</page><page sequence="7">From Zero to Hero 259 ties of this type of the narratee. First and foremost, the narratee-potential- reader/listener is evoked by an extradiegetic narrator and the former's properties can only be reconstructed indirectly from the latter' s discourse, in particular from commentaries which are directed to the "you" of the narratee. The narratee-potential-reader/listener exists only as the narrator's projection of a potential receiver of his/her narrative and not as an inde- pendent character within the presented world: he/she "is born" simultane- ously with the act of narration. Remarks directed to the "you" of the narratee-potential-reader/listener have a rhetorical character: they solicit his/her attention or explain some- thing to him/her. They do not constitute a narrative sequence on the basis of which some story about the narratee could be reconstructed from the text. Neither does the narrator's discourse comprise any elements which would imply the narratee-potential-reader/listener's prior existence: he/she lacks any specific personality, life story, age, and the like. Throughout the text he/she remains an anonymous "you," deprived of a proper name which would transform him/her into a character on the level of the pre- sented world. It is frequently even impossible to decide whether you refers to a single receiver of a text or a group of receivers. Within this broad category of the narratee two^basic sub-categories can be distinguished depending on the degree of concrétisation, which can be correlated with the role the narrator imposes on the narratee he/she is ad- dressing: a less concretised potential reader and a more concretised poten- tial listener. Furthermore, the narratee-potential-listener can be so concre- tised that his/her status is very close to, though not identical with, that of a character concretised on the level of the presented world, hence the need for a borderline sub-category of the narratee-almost-character. The word reader itself automatically attributes to the narratee the role of the reader when it is used in direct address to him/her. However, the at- tribution of this role to the narratee can also be indicated via less direct, though equally indubitable, textual signals. The "you" of the narratee be- comes the "you" of the potential reader as a result of the self-conscious- ness of the narrator who addresses him/her. Narratives evoking the narra- tee-potential-reader are narrated by narrators who emphasise that they are the authors of the text directed to the "you" of the narratee-reader, as hap- pens in David Malouf's An Imaginary Life , John Fowles's The French Lieutenant's Woman and John Berger's G. Their status is well expressed in</page><page sequence="8">260 J N T the term dramatised author introduced by Wallace Martin in his scheme of narrative communication (154). If the text is narrated by its author, then he/she must have written or must be writing it, and consequently the nar- ratee to whom it is directed is or will be reading it. The written medium via which the narrator communicates with the narratee-potential-reader imposes a specific temporal and spatial location on the latter. It precludes immediate, direct contact and distances the nar- ratee-potential-reader from the narrator both in space and time: the reader can read the text only after it has been written, hence the delayed charac- ter of their contact. Lack of immediate contact between the narrator and the narratee-potential-reader is also signalled by the tentative manner in which the former inscribes in his/her text the latter's reactions. He/she does not "actually" know them; he/she can only project them, as the fol- lowing passage from Fowles's The French Lieutenant's Woman demon- strates: "You may think that novelists always have fixed plans to which they work, so that the future predicted by Chapter One is always inex- orably the actuality of Chapter Thirteen" (86). As in the case of the narratee-potential-reader, the narratee-potential- listener's presence is evoked in the text by means of direct address to the "you." However, whereas the role of the reader is sometimes directly at- tributed to the former type of narratee by the narrator, there do not seem to exist examples of the "dear listener" convention. Thus, the narratee's role as listener is indicated by less obvious, though equally cogent, textual sig- nals. He/she is attributed the role of the listener if the text in which he/she is evoked displays the characteristics of skaz, that is of a narrative imitat- ing spontaneous speech. Paradoxically, the illusion of spontaneous speech is frequently gener- ated by the narrators' self-conscious comments on their own propensity to digress. As in everyday narratives (see Stempel 213), narrators in the skaz mode spontaneously correct themselves and attempt to control the flow of their narratives, frequently interrupted by random associations. This prop- erty of the skaz is especially prominent in Kazuo Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day and Patrick McGrath's The Grotesque, both of which focus on the fallible memories of their narrators. Both novels abound in expressions signalling the narrator's awareness that he/she is speaking to somebody who may have problems following his/her train of thought. Another typi- cal indicator of the skaz technique is the narrator's use of a colloquial reg-</page><page sequence="9">From Zero to Hero 261 ister or even slang, observable in such texts as Martin Amis's Money or James Hawes's A White Merc with Fins. Finally, the addressee-oriented expressions employed in the skaz have a conversational character. They frequently take the form of phatic expressions, typical of spoken dis- course: "By the time I had got to thinking this I had almost finished the smokescreen fag and I tell you , I had the willies good and proper again . . (Hawes 22, emphasis added). The combination of these textual ele- ments creates the illusion of the narrator talking to somebody. However, it does not mean that an "actual" act of oral transmission takes place on the level of the presented world. The narratives directed to the narratee-poten- tial-listener include no signals on the basis of which the narrative situation could be reconstructed or the narratee's presence at the narrator's side de- termined. There are, for instance, no indications of visual or physical con- tact between these two agents. As might be expected, there are also some borderline cases in which a potential listener is projected and yet ad- dressed as if he/she were concretised within the presented world. This nar- ratee-almost-character will be discussed in the final part of this section. Like the narratee-potential-reader, the narratee-potential-listener is pro- jected by the narrator's discourse. The narrator presents the events in the manner in which he/she would present them if he/she was talking about them to somebody, but his/her addressee is not a specific interlocutor con- cretised on the level of the presented world; he/she is just a possible lis- tener. He/she can be regarded as more concretised than the narratee-poten- tial-reader, because the skaz creates the illusion of the "you" being present at the narrator's side, which is a prerequisite for oral communication. In contrast to texts with a narratee-potential-reader, there are usually no indi- cations of a temporal or spatial distance separating the narrator and the narratee. The spoken discourse of the narrator emphasises rather the im- mediacy of the contact between the two of them. The illusion of immedi- acy is heightened by the use of direct questions and question tags, which seem to call for an immediate response: "But perhaps you think I'm mak- ing all this up, perhaps you think these the delusions of a diseased imagi- nation. Explain to me why, then, if Fledge had not seduced Harriet, and thus bent her to his will, she made no protest when he turned my wheel- chair to the wall?" (McGrath 81). Passages like this attribute to the narra- tee the role of an active interlocutor, who is supposed to respond to the narrator's words; or rather, they create the illusion of the narratee's active</page><page sequence="10">262 J N T participation, since the narrator's discourse does not register the narratee's immediate reaction. In Julian Barnes's Talking It Over the narratee is evoked in a manner which situates him/her on the borderline between a potential receiver and a character concretised on the level of the presented world. The narrators of this novel address the narratee as if physical and visual contact existed between them and they could see their listener's reactions: "Oh dear, you're giving me that look again. You don't have to say it. I know. You think I'm a patronising pudendum, don't you" (Barnes 27). Despite all such signals of direct contact, one cannot reconstruct from the text a fic- tional situation in which this contact is taking place or attribute to the nar- ratee a specific identity. The narratee projected in this novel can thus be la- belled a narratee-almost-character: addressed as if he/she were present at the narrator's side, he/she approaches the status of a character, but at the same time he/she is never fully concretised as an individual existing within the fictional world. The variety of forms which the evocation of the narratee-potential- reader/listener can take in modern fiction suggests that Robyn Warhol's distinction between engaging and distancing narrative strategies (31^4) can be broadened to accommodate not so much the gender of the narrator as the mode of communication projected in a given narrative. The evoca- tion of the narratee-potential-reader, with its emphasis on the written medium separating the narratee (and the implied reader) from the narrator and the presented world, can be considered a distancing device; on the other hand, the skaz format creates the illusion of immediate contact be- tween these two agents and thus displays the characteristics of an engag- ing strategy. Paradoxically, when pushed to its limits, the skaz becomes a distancing device, destroying the illusion of the immediacy of contact be- tween the narrator and the implied reader, who cannot identify with the narratee-almost-character. The narratee-character In his "Introduction to the Study of the Narratee" Prince observes that "often instead of addressing - explicitly or implicitly - a narratee who is not a character, the narrator recounts his story to someone who is" (18) and assumes that the difference between the two categories of the narratee</page><page sequence="11">From Zero to Hero 263 will become self-evident if one considers such texts as Heart of Darkness, Portnoy's Complaint, Les infortunes de la vertu and L' Immoraliste, which he mentions as examples of the latter category. Indeed, the difference be- tween the communicative structures of Tom Jones and Heart of Darkness is easily noticeable; however, in order to be clearly identifiable in a text structure, the category of the narratee-character needs to be described in terms of the textual signals of its presence as well as its general properties, distinguishing it from other types of narratee. Two basic techniques whereby the presence of the narratee-character is established can be identified. On the one hand, he/she can be introduced in a manner analogous to the manner in which the narratee-potential- reader/listener is evoked, that is, by means of textual signals appearing in the discourse of the narrator addressing him/her. On the other hand, the narratee-character can be introduced by means of a frame narrative, in which characters engaged in the act of narrative exchange are directly de- scribed. The narratee-character is presented in a manner which indicates, or sometimes only suggests, that he/she exists within the presented world in- dependently of the narrator who addresses him/her. In this respect the nar- ratee-character differs from the narratee-potential-reader/listener, who is brought into being in the narrator's act of projection of a possible receiver of his/her narrative and whose properties do not extend beyond his/her in- terpretive competence. Concretised on the level of the presented world, the narratee-character usually possesses a much wider range of attributes than the narratee-potential-reader/listener; they include a specific gender, age, social status, family relationship to the narrator, past experience and such like. These qualities can be presented in Piwowarczyk's general terms of identity, spatial and temporal location, status and role (see Pi- wowarczyk 176), but they cannot be generalised into a definite set of fea- tures identifiable in all cases of the narratee-character, as they vary with individual narratees. The quantity and quality of the textual data concerning the narratee- character, in other words the degree of his/her concrétisation, can be cor- related with the signals whereby his/her presence is established. Analo- gously to the concrétisation of the narratee-potential-reader/listener, the concrétisation of the narratee-character is gradable: some narratee-charac- ters approach the status of a narratee-potential-reader/listener, others are</page><page sequence="12">264 J N T closer to a narratee-protagonist. Three basic sub-categories of the narratee- character can be distinguished according to the manner in which he/she is presented: addressed character, characterised addressee and a borderline category of narratee-co-protagonist. Least concretised and most similar to the narratee-potential- reader/listener is the narratee whose presence is established only by means of evocative devices appearing in the extradiegetic narrator's discourse. His/her status is similar, though by no means identical, to that of the nar- ratee-potential-reader/listener: his/her existence is signalled in the narra- tive directed to him/her, hence the term addressed character employed in my typology to designate this type of narratee-character. What distinguishes the addressed character from the narratee-potential- reader/listener is the presence of textual elements which concretise the for- mer as a character existing on the level of the presented world. On the most basic level the effect of concrétisation is generated by a combination of the second-person pronoun in its address function with such identifying phrases as a term of a family relationship or a reference to the narratee's occupation. Consider the opening of William Golding's Rites of Passage: "Honoured godfather, With those words I begin the journal I engaged my- self to keep for you - no words could be more suitable" (Golding 3). The use of the appelative "Honoured godfather" indicates that the narrator is not directing his narrative to a potential addressee, whose only property is his/her position as an interpreter of his narrative, but to a specific individ- ual existing on the level of the presented world. Typical as the device mentioned above is, it does not constitute the only technique whereby the presence of the narratee-character is evoked. A "bare" second-person form itself can be employed in a manner that sig- nals to the reader that the you designates somebody concretised on the level of the presented world. The opening words of J. M. Coetzee's Age of Iron make it clear that the narrator is not addressing a potential receiver of her narrative: "There is an alley down the side of the garage, you may re- member it, you and your friends would sometimes play there. Now it is a dead place, waste, without use, where windblown leaves pile up and rot" (Coetzee, Age of Iron 3). The reference to the narratee's memory of the alley and his/her behaviour in the past signals to the reader that the narra- tor is addressing somebody who has some knowledge - coming from per- sonal experience - of the specific place described. The attribution of this</page><page sequence="13">From Zero to Hero 265 sort of knowledge to the "you" indicates that the narratee is an element of the presented world. Obviously, the narrator's words do not reveal much about the narratee and his/her relation to the narrator. It is only a few pages later that the narratee-character of this particular novel turns out to be the narrator's daughter. The passage from Age of Iron exemplifies another distinctive property of the signals of the addressed character's presence. The addressed charac- ter's concrétisation is frequently signalled by allusions to a specific past experience shared by the narrator and the narratee, or to the circumstances in which the narrative exchange supposedly takes place, or to the narra- tee's recent actions. References of this type endow the narratee-character with substantiality and distinguish him/her as a category of narratee from the narratee-potential-reader/listener: he/she is presented as a fictional character, frequently endowed with a specific gender, occupation and past, and is capable of actions other than merely reading or listening to the nar- rator's narrative. Even though the addressed character is evoked in a manner analogous to that in which the narratee-potential-reader/listener is evoked - that is, by means of direct address - the former's presence does not directly draw the reader into the communicative circuit. What precludes the reader's identification with the addressee is the presence of concretising details, which emphasise that the "you" of the addressee does possess some dis- tinctive features going beyond a generally understood interpretive compe- tence. Only if these features are fairly general in nature - as happens, for instance, in John Banville's The Book of Evidence, in which the narrator is addressing members of the jury - can the reader identify, albeit only vicar- iously, with the concretised narratee. The reader is thus put in the position of an observer, rather than participant, of the communicative act; conse- quently, he/she can focus on the elements of the narrator's attitude to and frequently manipulation of the concretised narratee. The frame narrative which describes the circumstances of the narrative act and in which an addressee of an embedded narrative is presented in the same way as other fictional characters constitutes the most typical device whereby the second sub-category of narratee-character, the characterised addressee, is introduced. This is how the narratee of this type is evoked in such classics as The Decameron or The Canterbury Tales. What seems to be peculiar to modern fiction is the use of a less straightforward technique</page><page sequence="14">266 J N T of characterising the addressee: paradoxically, the narrator who addresses a given narratee describes him/her as a character as well. A communica- tive set-up which allows the direct characterisation of an addressee (ad- dressee A) involves either a shift in, rather than an alternation between, the narrative mode(s) or the presence of an additional addressee (addressee B) for whose sake addressee A is described. In the former case the narrator presents the narrative situation, involving the presence of addressee A, without evoking any other narratee and then proceeds to describe his/her own act of storytelling. Obviously, the presentation of the narrative situa- tion can equally well be positioned after the framed narrative. As regards the structure involving the evocation of two narratees, two basic types of textual arrangement can be distinguished: sequential and simultaneous. In the case of a sequential arrangement a narrative directed to narratee A is preceded or followed by a narrative directed to narratee B, in which narra- tee A appears as a character. In simultaneous narration narratees A and В are evoked concurrently, the former being characterised for the latter' s sake. J. M. Coetzee's Foe is an example of a structure involving a shift in the narrative mode. The first two chapters of the novel consist of an account of life on a desert island and a series of letters directed by a female cast- away, Susan Barton, to a writer named Foe. In the third chapter of the novel Susan Barton describes her encounter with Foe, who thus becomes a character in her narrative. Nicholas Mosley's Judith is an example of a more complex - yet inter- pretable in verisimilar terms - communicative structure in which sequen- tial and simultaneous arrangements are employed concurrently. The novel consists of three letters written by the eponymous heroine to three differ- ent addressees, identified at the beginning of each letter as Bert, the Pro- fessor and Jason. Bert, the addressee of the first letter, appears as a char- acter in the letter directed to Jason. The Professor, the addressee of the second letter, appears as a character in the first letter: the events described in the second letter and this letter itself seem to be the result of the Profes- sor's actions described in the first letter. Finally, Jason, the addressee of the third letter, appears as a character in the second one. Thus, interpreted in terms of relationships between the characterised addressees, Judith is an example of a sequential arrangement. What makes the novel an instance of a simultaneous arrangement is the</page><page sequence="15">From Zero to Hero 267 fact that Judith concurrently directs her subsequent letters to the narratee- potential-reader. She self-consciously exploits the inherent ambiguity of the second-person pronoun and employs it to evoke both a given charac- terised addressee and the narratee-potential-reader. The very first refer- ences to the "you" display Judith's awareness of the existence of the "you" of the narratee-potential-reader: "Then I got a small part in the West End in a play called Judith. I . . . thought that from the play I might learn some- thing about myself: I am, as you know (I mean you, not you!), called Ju- dith" (Mosley, Judith 4). The fact that she distinguishes between the "you" of a characterised addressee and the "you" of a narratee-potential-reader (rather than between, say, two characterised addressees) is signalled by the manner in which she conceives of the difference between the two ad- dressees of her letters. What distinguishes them is the knowledge they have of her and she has of them. Bert, who belongs to the presented world and who has apparently known her for some time, already knows her name; the narratee-potential-reader, who has known her for one page, learns it when she mentions it. Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children , another instance of a simulta- neous arrangement, might at first sight seem to be an example of a typical framed structure. The Arabian Nights being one of its intertexts, Mid- night's Children presents an act of oral communication: Saleem, the narra- tor, is telling his life story to his female companion, Padma. The only problem is that he is also - as his self-conscious remarks reveal - writing a book directed to the "you" of the narratee-potential-reader in which he de- scribes his own act of storytelling and his listener, Padma. Differences in narrative structure notwithstanding, the three novels mentioned above share one property: the manner in which the narratee- character addressed by a given narrator is presented. As my term charac- terised addressee indicates, he/she is characterised in the manner in which other characters are characterised, that is, by means of direct description. Consider the following example: The staircase was dark and mean. My knock echoed as if on emptiness. But I knocked a second time, and heard a shuffling, and from behind the door a voice, his voice, low and cautious. 'It is I, Susan Barton,' I announced - T am alone, with Friday.' Whereupon the door opened and he</page><page sequence="16">268 J N T stood before me, the same Foe I had first set eyes on in Kensington Row, but leaner and quicker, as though vigi- lance and a spare diet agreed with him (Coetzee, Foe 113). In the case of the characterised addressee, the narrator provides con- cretising details, such as descriptions of the appearance, manner of speak- ing and personality, on the basis of which the reader can visualise the char- acters to whom he/she has addressed, is addressing or will address his/her narrative. The features of Foe, Padma or the Professor do not have to be reconstructed from indirect hints incorporated into remarks directed to the narratee; they are directly given. Furthermore, the character-like status of the characterised addressee allows an explicit presentation of his/her re- sponses to the narrator's story. This property of the characterised ad- dressee is especially prominent in Midnight's Children ; Saleem frequently interrupts his narrative to quote Padma's reactions to his stories: "'What happened to the plumpie?' Padma asks, crossly. 'You don't mean you aren't going to te//?"' (Rushdie 64). The passages quoted above are merely samples of the ways in which the addressees can be concretised. One can find in Foe , Judith and Mid- night's Children examples of most of the characterisation techniques iden- tified in theoretical studies of this aspect of narrative fiction (e.g. Rim- mon-Kenan 59-70). In all three novels the amount of concretising details enables the reader to reconstruct an image of a given characterised ad- dressee, which comprises at least his/her appearance, way of speaking and some habitual actions, but - naturally - the amount of concretising data varies from narrative to narrative. Identified only by means of their pro- fessions and concretised by virtue of their presence on the boat, Marlow's listeners in Conrad's Heart of Darkness might be considered examples of minimally characterised addressees, whose basic property is their position of listeners. On the other hand, the presence of a larger number of details may endow a given characterised addressee with multidimensionality and enable an analysis which goes beyond his/her position of narratee. Apart from the categories of addressed character and characterised ad- dressee, the borderline category of the narratee-co-protagonist approaching the status of the narratee-protagonist can be distinguished. Even though a typical narratee-character is a significant element of the text structure,</page><page sequence="17">From Zero to Hero 269 he/she is not presented in as much detail as the narrator addressing him/her or characters appearing in the narrative directed to him/her; in other words, he/she cannot be regarded as the protagonist of a given text. However, in some narratives the narratee-character is evoked and presented in a way which indicates that he/she occupies a position equal in centrality, or de- gree of concrétisation, to that of the narrator addressing him/her. This is so in texts in which the same character functions as a narrator and a narratee in the communicative structure of a given text. Nicholas Mosley's Hopeful Monsters is a good example of such a communicative structure; the major part of the novel consists of two interwoven dramatic monologues in which two protagonists, Max and Eleanor, address each other. Both Max and Eleanor focus in their monologues on their personal experiences, espe- cially those related to the addressees of their respective monologues. The reader is thus provided not only with direct access to their psyches but also with many more concretising details than in the case of a typical narratee- character (and other characters in this particular novel). Consequently, both Max and Eleanor can be considered to be the central characters of the novel; in other words, they are co-protagonists of Hopeful Monsters. What distinguishes the evocation of the narratee-co-protagonist from the ways in which the addressed character and the characterised addressee are presented is the presence of extensive passages in which the actions of the "you" of the narratee are narrated. Consider the following passage from Hopeful Monsters : You were sitting with your back against the pillar of an arched window in the wall of the main structure of the cas- tle; you were holding a pencil and a piece of paper on your knee. You were turning the pencil over and over. I thought - Yes, you are like one of those figures on the pil- lars in the cloister; you are being your own music. . . . When you had looked up and seen me you had not shown any very obvious surprise. You became very still. You had stopped turning the pencil over and over on your knee. (454) This passage can be contrasted with passages directed to the addressed character, which usually have a rhetorical, not narrative character. It nar-</page><page sequence="18">270 J N T rates the narratee's specific actions and in this respect it can be related to the way in which the characterised addressee is presented. What distin- guishes it, in turn, from typical descriptions of the characterised addressee is the fact that it focuses on the narratee qua a character in the manner typ- ical of narratives directed to the narratee-protagonist, that is, by means of second-person narration. The above sub-categorisation of the narratee-character is based on the communicative structure created by the implied author in a given text, not on his/her ontological status within the presented world. In other words, the narratee-co-protagonist is not by definition "more real" than the char- acterised addressee; he/she appears to be more concretised to the reader since the latter is provided by the implied author (and usually via a narra- tor) with more concretising data. The only exception here would be con- stituted by frame narratives of the Arabian Nights type, in which the au- thority of a godlike extraheterodiegetic narrator guarantees the ontological integrity of the intradiegetic narrator-character and narratee-character. However, frame narratives can be, and frequently are, presented by ho- modiegetic narrators (e.g. the unnamed "first" narrator in Heart of Dark- ness), whose inherent subjectivity affects the ontological status of the characters they describe. Likewise, narratees evoked by means of direct address may only be the narrator's fantasy. Both the presentation of the narrative situation and the evocation of a concretised figure of, say, daugh- ter, doctor or patron suggest that a given event - an act of transmission - has "really" happened and that a given character "really" exists in the pre- sented world; however, there is always a possibility that they are actually fantasised by a narrator who has never sailed out to the Thames estuary or who is childless. Such a situation is not only a theoretical idea for a book to be written: Josipovici's Countre-jour , another novel in which the category of the nar- ratee-co-protagonist can be identified, projects a narrative situation of this type. The novel consists of two dramatic monologues of "daughter" talk- ing to "mother" and "mother" talking to "daughter." In the middle of her monologue, which creates a vivid picture of the "you" through its detailed descriptions of the narratee's actions, the mother exclaims - "Oh my daughter. Whom I never had" (Josipovici 93) - thus revealing that the daughter she is talking to is her fantasised projection, a fictional construc-</page><page sequence="19">From Zero to Hero 271 tion within a fictional world, the status of which is comparable to that of the dreams or fantasies fictional characters have. In a sense the presence of the narratee-character is what Warhol would call a distancing device: the reader is reminded that he/she is not the ad- dressee of the narrative directed to the narratee-character and is situated in the position of an external observer. Consequently, the functions of the narratee-character in a given novel should be construed in the terms in which the functions of other textual elements are considered, the direct manipulation of the reader no longer predominating here. The identity of a particular narratee-character is a component of the overall meaning of the text: it usually reveals the narrator's predicament or psychological traits. At the same time, by making a narrator address a given narratee, the im- plied author can endow the narrative exchange with a figurative meaning, this symbolic function being a distinctive property of the narratee-charac- ter. The narratee-protagonist In his Dictionary of Narratolo gy Prince offers the following definition of second-person narrative: "a narrative the narratee of which is the pro- tagonist in the story s/he is told" (84). While it is not the most compre- hensive definition of a second-person narrative as such - it excludes a sig- nificant number of texts in which the narrative you designates a fictional protagonist who is not a narratee (Fludernik, "Introduction" 287) - it does characterise aptly the narratives which will be discussed in the present section. The category of narratee-protagonist designates precisely the nar- ratee who is the protagonist in the story he/she is told. The first part of the term refers to the position which the narratee-pro- tagonist occupies in the communicative structure of a given narrative: he/she is the addressee of the narrator's story. The latter refers to his/her relative status as a character: it designates the status of a narratee-protago- nist in relation to other characters appearing in the same narrative as well as other categories of the narratee, especially the neighbouring category of the narratee-character. The "you" of the narratee-protagonist is the central character of these narratives, which tell "your" story. The focal point of such novels as Ron Butlin's The Sound of My Voice , Sunetra Gupta's The Glassblower's Breath and Peter Kocan's The Treatment , he/she is pre-</page><page sequence="20">272 J N T sented in more detail than all the other characters and can be regarded as more concretised than these characters. He/she is also more concretised than other categories of the narratee, which are either subordinated to or equal in status to other characters.4 The narratee can become a protagonist in a second-person narrative if the character occupying the central position of the protagonist is cast in the role of the narratee, this function being signalled by the use of the sec- ond-person pronoun in its address function in relation to him/her. While the sustained use of the second-person perspective signals that you desig- nates the protagonist of a given narrative, it does not always unequivocally attribute to this protagonist the position of the narratee. In her studies of second-person narrative Fludernik emphasises that it can lack an allocu- tive function, which would signal that you evokes not only the protagonist but also the addressee of a given narrative. The lack of communicative function is characteristic of a second-person narrative in a reflector mode, in which, argues Fludernik, the second-person pronoun is employed to designate the reflector-character and to establish the centre of conscious- ness from whose experiential perspective the events are presented ("Sec- ond Person Fiction" 222, Towards a 'Natural' Narratolo gy 229). Consequently, you designates the narratee-protagonist if the use of the second-person pronoun is correlated with signals of the communicative character of the narrative in which the "you" qua protagonist appears. The most potent signal that the "you" is a narratee is the use of imperatives, this grammatical form endowing a given narrative with an exhortative character. Consider the following passage from Ron Butlin's The Sound of my Voice : "The alarm clock - has stopped ringing. Lie still . Relax for a few moments before getting up. Let the sunlight colour-in the room - that's its job, not yours. Relax. Kiss Mary. Say : good morning Mary. And smile. This is the first day" (130, emphasis added). The conative character of the sentences marked in the above passage indicates, on the one hand, the presence of the narrator uttering them and, on the other, the address func- tion of you. This passage exemplifies one more property typical of second- person narratives evoking the presence of a narratee-protagonist: the ad- dress function frequently remains latent, only to be revealed in the final part, as happens in the case of the aforementioned imperatives. Since the narratee-protagonist is the main character of a given narra- tive, he/she is concretised in much greater detail than other characters, the</page><page sequence="21">From Zero to Hero 273 narratee-potential-reader/listener or the narratee-character. His/her actions, thoughts, memories and similar concretising details constitute the main core of the text directed to him/her. These attributes of the narratee-pro- tagonist are directly described and not indirectly alluded to, thus facilitat- ing the reader's (re)construction of the narratee-protagonist. It might seem that the centrality of the narratee-protagonist precludes the possibility of any sub-division of this category according to the degree of concrétisation. A given narratee is either the main character or not; and if he/she is not the central character, then some other character is and the nar- ratee, concretised as he/she is on the level of the presented world, is either a co-protagonist or a characterised addressee or an addressed character. In- deed, the narratee-protagonist proper cannot be sub-divided according to the degree of concrétisation analogously to the distinction between poten- tial reader and potential listener or between addressed character and char- acterised addressee. However, in a few second-person narratives a peculiar phenomenon can be observed: you is employed to evoke simultaneously the protagonist concretised on the level of the presented world and the po- tential reader of a given text; hence, my use of the term narratee-potential- protagonist to denote the peculiar position of this narratee. This category of narratee can be identified in hypothetical and autotelic modes of second- person narrative distinguished by Brian Richardson (28-34) from the most popular standard form, in which the narratee-specific-protagonist may ap- pear. In Lorri Moore's story "How to Be an Other Woman," opening her collection Self-Help , the best known example of the hypothetical mode, the extensive use of imperatives clearly evokes the narratee in a manner analo- gous to that in which the potential reader is evoked: "Meet in expensive beige raincoats, on a pea-soupy night. Like a detective movie. First, stand in front of Florsheim's Fifty-seventh street, press your face close to the glass, watch the fake velvet Hümmels inside revolving around the wing tips" (Moore 3). At the same time, these imperatives are combined with de- scriptive passages, which project a fictional scenario and attribute to the "you" individual features, concretising him/her on the level of the pre- sented world and precluding the reader's unproblematic identification. Bill Manhire's parody of a "choose-your-own-adventure" story, The Brain of Katherine Mansfield , can be classified as an instance of an au- totelic second-person narrative. The paradoxical status of the "you" ad- dressed in this text results from the generic convention parodied by Man-</page><page sequence="22">274 J N T hire. Its constitutive element is the use of the second-person pronoun in reference to the protagonist whose actions are described in the text and with whom the reader is expected to identify. At the same time, you is used as a pronoun of address in passages inviting the reader to select one of the alternatives offered. As in other second-person narratives, the "you" of the narratee evoked in Manhire's novel is the central character of the novel, whose specific ac- tions, experiences and impressions, narrated in the present tense, consti- tute the core of the narrative. Consider the following example: "In a swift jack-knifing movement you launch yourself at Herr Schneidermann, si- multaneously flicking open the Swiss Army Knife. A look of fear crosses your opponent's face only to be replaced by one of triumph. For you are attacking him with the toothpick" (Manhire 29).5 Specific as the actions (and misfortunes) of the "you" are, the properties explicitly attributed to him by the narrator at the very beginning of the novel are reduced to a set of very general features. The ostentatiously emphasised typicality of the "you" is an element of Manhire's parodie exaggeration of the stock prop- erties of the "choose-your-own-adventure" convention: it is supposed to facilitate the reader's identification with the "you" and willing immersion in the fictional world of the protagonist's adventures. Seen from another perspective, the generality of his/her attributes relates the narratee evoked in Manhire's novel to the narratee-potential-reader, who is also, although less explicitly, presented in very general terms. The similarity between the narratee of The Brain of Katherine Mans- field and the narratee-potential-reader is even more pronounced in pas- sages of direct, rhetorical address. Most sections of the novel end with in- structions on how to proceed with reading, the development of the plot frequently depending on the choice the "you" is supposed to make: The time of your first decision is upon you. Do you dare to turn the pages of adventure? If you decide to accompany the old man, go to 5. If you decide to go home and think it over, go to 11. (Manhire 2) The self-conscious reference to "the pages of adventure" and the two al- ternative instructions which follow it indicate that the "you" does not des-</page><page sequence="23">From Zero to Hero 275 ignate only a character concretised on the level of the presented world. These words evoke rather a potential reader of Manhire's novel and make him/her a co-creator of the story of the adventures experienced by the "you" qua protagonist. The existence of second-person narratives in hypothetical and autotelic modes, rare as they are, suggests that in the case of the narratee's concréti- sation the paradoxical rule of the meeting of the opposites applies: be- tween the categories of the narratee-protagonist and the narratee-potential- reader/listener we should locate the borderline category of the narratee-potential-protagonist, who on the one hand is the central charac- ter of a given narrative and who on the other hand approaches the status of the narratee-potential-reader/listener - this dual nature of the "you" evoked in these texts strongly encouraging the reader's identification with the "you," temporal or occasional as it may be. Such a description of the mechanisms of autotelic second-person narration seems more precise than Richardson's insistence that it "regularly fuses the narratee and the actual reader" (130). Second-person narration, or for that matter any kind of nar- ration, cannot change the actual reader's ontological status or identity. It can provoke him/her to identify with the "you" it evokes; however, this is not the same process as the fusing Richardson is writing about. * * * Considerations of space preclude a detailed discussion of all modern novels in which the narratee appears, the texts mentioned above being - hopefully - a representative sample. What they demonstrate is that the narratee can be evoked by a wide range of textual signals and that he/she can occupy a number of definable positions in the text structure. Rather than list all the existing instances of narratee evocation and all the features attributed to this textualised figure of an addressee, the present essay has attempted to discuss the full spectrum of theoretically identifiable posi- tions as regards the narratee's concrétisation as well as the most typical ef- fects of the evocation of the narratee. The typology developed in it can therefore be applied to the narratee and narrative fiction in general, even though the examples come from modern fiction in English. Likewise, what has been said about the general properties and functions of particular</page><page sequence="24">276 J N T categories of the narratee as well as the relationship between the narratee and the reader seems applicable to narrative fiction in general. The inclusion of examples coming from other literatures would not have changed substantially the major theses of this paper, such as the divi- sion into three main types and their sub-categorisation, though it should be admitted that some differences between texts written in different lan- guages do exist. Every literary narrative being a verbal construct, the na- ture of the signals establishing the presence of the narratee and attributing to him/her some properties will depend on the language in which a given text is written. In many cases it is impossible to decide whether the narra- tee-potential-reader/listener is a man or a woman, a single person or a group of people, this vagueness resulting from the nature of the English pronoun you. Most probably, it would be impossible not to disclose the narratee's gender or number in narratives written in highly inflectional languages with more complex pronominal systems, such as French or Ital- ian. Thus, the French or Italian narratee-potential-reader/listener will prob- ably be more concretised than his/her English counterpart, but he/she can still be distinguished from the narratee-character or sub-categorised into narratee-potential-reader and narratee-potential-listener. The degree of concrétisation seems to have a direct impact on the reader's identification with the addressee inscribed in a given text. Even though this issue depends to a significant extent on the attributes of partic- ular narratees, some generalisations are possible in this respect. The fic- tional insubstantiality of the narratee-potential-reader/listener facilitates the reader's identification with the "you" projected by the narrator. On the other hand, whether a given narratee-potential-reader/listener embodies the implied author's assumptions as to the implied reader depends on the distance between the narrator and the author and the type of the conven- tion selected by the latter. Concretised on the level of the presented world and evoked by means of specific references to his/her past, profession or status, the narratee-character does not encourage the reader's identifica- tion, as it is clear that the narrative is directed to somebody else. This issue is slightly more complicated in the case of the narratee-protagonist. The consistent use of second-person forms may create the illusion that the reader is being addressed; however, this effect is counteracted by the insis- tent attribution of specific features to the "you." Thus, the reader's identi- fication will depend on the similarity between his/her and the narratee-</page><page sequence="25">From Zero to Hero 277 protagonist's features and experiences. As regards the implied reader, the specificity of the attributes of the narratee-character and the narratee-pro- tagonist is a clear indication that the addressee evoked by the narrator is not to be identified with the reader assumed by the implied author. Even though the present study is based on contemporary examples, the theoretical model presented in it is meant to allow the classification of nar- ratees identifiable in all narratives written so far. Nevertheless, it must be remembered that this typology of narratees describes a certain stage in the development and accumulation of narrative forms. Perhaps in the future there will appear new narratives (just as second-person narratives have gained in prominence only recently) which will necessitate the modifica- tion of the typology, though again the necessary changes are not likely to be fundamental in nature. Most probably, they will involve the introduc- tion of some new sub-category possessing some sufficiently distinctive features. As regards the diachronic aspect of the present study, the examples of the texts discussed in it suggest the existence of some qualities peculiar to the modern evocation of the narratee. In the case of the narratee-potential- reader/listener the widespread use of the skaz , evoking the potential lis- tener, seems to be a contemporary phenomenon, which complements the "dear reader" convention. The current popularity of this narrative form has already been noted by Fludernik, for whom it marks a return to the oral roots of narrative ( Towards a 'Natural' Narratolo gy 179). As regards the narratee-character, traditional frame narratives seem to have given way to narratives in which the circumstances of the narrative exchange are indi- rectly described in the narrator's monologue. What is also peculiar to con- temporary narratives is the fact that the narrator who addresses a given narratee-character may also describe him/her in a character-like manner, a change of the addressee or a shift in the narrative mode enabling such a dual perspective. Another major prototype of texts evoking the narratee- character, the epistolary form, can still be found in some texts; however, its primary function is no longer to endow a given narrative with a (pseudo)-documentary value as its conventionality is taken for granted. The model of a collection of letters has, in turn, evolved into a collage of narratives, usually in the skaz format, the establishment of the relations between them being the reader's task. The wide variety of forms whereby the narratee can be evoked suggests</page><page sequence="26">278 J N T that the inscription of the addressee cannot be correlated with only one type of fiction. The literary conventions employed in them range from the psy- chological realism of Kocan's The Treatment , thorough the symbolic ex- ploration of la condition humaine of Banville's The Book of Evidence and the Gothic of The Grotesque , to the explicit, postmodern metafiction of Midnight's Children and formal experiments of Josipovici's Contre-jour. Irrespective of the convention in which it appears, the evocation of the narratee can be regarded an autothematic device. David Malcolm argues that the presence of autothematic elements - understood as ones explicitly presenting "the process of composition, the role of the author, the nature of narratives and their relationship to reality" (24) - is one of the distinc- tive features of contemporary British fiction. The examples of the novels discussed in this essay suggest that Malcolm's conclusion can be applied to contemporary fiction in English and that his list should be extended to comprise the role of the reader and the communicative nature of litera- ture - or every linguistic utterance for that matter. While they do not nec- essarily thematise the process of creation or relationship to reality, they do remind us that every literary text is directed to someone. Notes 1 . It seems justified to assume that the narratee can be regarded an anthropomorphic crit- ical construct, modelled on human beings: I have not found any texts explicitly ad- dressed to an entity which would be analogous to the non-human narrators of extreme narration analysed by Brian Richardson. 2. Throughout the essay, two different typographic forms are used in reference to the sec- ond-person pronoun. Italics are used to indicate that you is discussed specifically as a pronoun. Quotation marks signal, in turn, that the "you" is used as a métonymie sub- stitute for the fictional being the second-person pronoun refers to. 3. In all the passages the emphasis is added. 4. Obviously, it is frequently impossible to decide who is the central character of a given narrative, as the cases of the Marlow/Kurtz or Ahab/Ishmael controversies demon- strate. My application of the term protagonist is intended to pinpoint the difference be- tween the category of the narratee to which it is applied and other categories of the narratee without arguing that it always possible to identify the central character of a given narrative.</page><page sequence="27">From Zero to Hero 279 5.
