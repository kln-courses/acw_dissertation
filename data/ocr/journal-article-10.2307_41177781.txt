<plain_text><page sequence="1">FIVE PHILOSOPHICAL POINTS ON THE NON-PHILOSOPHICAL TRUTH OF THEOLOGY: A Neo Averroist View STEPHEN D. CRITES гтрнЕ points that follow and the comments on them are about A theological truth, but they are not themselves theological. Given the diversity of religious traditions, any attempt to offer generally acceptable theological points about theological truth would in the very nature of the case be doomed to failure. It is conceivable that a Southern Baptist and a Vaishnavite might understand one another's views of theological truth, but it is scarcely conceivable that they would agree. At least they could not be brought to agreement through normal forms of reasoned discourse, however reasonable both of them might be. Agreement between them would signalize a historical development of some proportions, or at least a personal conversion. For, as we shall argue, theological truth is historically situated and specific. But to make philosophical points about theological truth means that we shall be discussing it at such an abstract level of generality that our points might be acceptable, in principle, to anyone, without compromising his religious commitments or even compromising a steadfast rejection of any such commitments at all. For philosophical points cannot determine the concrete truth of any theological tradition. What I shall attempt to do instead Mr. Crites is Professor of Religion and currently a fellow of the Center for the Humanities at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. He has translated Kierkegaard's Crisis in the Life of an Actress and Other Essays on Drama and is presently at work on a manuscript entitled Gospel and Dialectic in the Philosophy of Hegel 187</page><page sequence="2">188 SOUNDINGS is to explain the special sense in which theological truth can be said to be concrete and alive. Still my points may in fact meet with disagreement. But it will not be like the theological disagree- ment between the Baptist and the Vaishnavite. Nothing of the order of religious conversion would be necessary in order for others to be convinced of my points, or for me to abandon them. Philosophical ideas are controversial, but purely within the gen- eralized terms of reasoned discourse. If they are worth discussing at all, they generally serve to initiate discussion rather than to conclude it. These opening comments are not merely advertisements for the points to be made. With these comments the argument has already begun, for my aim is precisely to distinguish between the character of theological and philosophical truth claims. So before turning to my philosophical points about theological truth it may be worthwhile to pursue a little further the question: What is a philosophical point? One means to be saying something true. But then what is a philosophical truth-claim? That question has tended to be obscured by the very intellectual-historical perspectives on the philosophical tradition which in modern times have so illuminated the social dynamics of philosophical thinking. The modern historical consciousness has made us aware that all thinking is socially and therefore historically situated: The situation of the thinker confronts him with his most compelling problems, provides him with the mate- rials of his thought, and conditions the way he goes about his thinking. Such, at least, are the common assumptions. But even if we do not challenge such assumptions, the reductive conclusions often drawn from them are implicitly challenged as soon as the question of truth is raised. When a philosopher claims that what he says is true, he means that it is certified independently of the social or personal conditions that may have led him to make the statement. Of course a person who makes an assertion does not commonly add, "and that is true, too." An unqualified assertion commonly implies a truth claim. Yet there is an implicit distinc- tion between the fact that a philosopher says something and his claim that it is true. I may ask him, "What makes you say that?" and to that question an autobiographical answer would suffice. But if I ask the quite different question, "Why is that true?" an</page><page sequence="3">FIVE PHILOSOPHICAL POINTS 189 adequate answer would have to provide grounds that would in principle be compelling to any rational observer. Philosophical truth is certified by the assemblage of rational observers. But that assemblage is as such ahistorical, ideal, it may or may not have identifiable members of flesh and blood. That does not at all deny that the philosopher himself is an altogether fleshly presence whose thought processes have a chemistry as well as a psychology and a history. But it is important to distinguish between the sources and the psycho-social process of philosophical thinking, and the essentially ahistorical certification to which philosophers appeal in making truth claims. A philosopher gen- erally does reflect the Zeitgeist in his thinking, and there may be a zealous company of people who think he is right; philosophers have even been known to swim in schools. But such social facts have nothing to do with the certification of philosophical truth. The ideal assemblage of rational beings to which a philosopher appeals to certify his truth claims is not to be confused with his school, and even if that ideal assemblage had not a single actual member besides himself he would not necessarily be deterred. Let's admit that he might get discouraged, but that is the fault of human frailty, not philosophy. There is no necessity for there being more than one instance of rationality, or even one. It would still be an important regulative principle that philosophical truth is universally certified by all rational beings. This notion of certification is admittedly significant only at a level of dizzying abstraction remote from the concerns philoso- phers normally have in going about their work. But I introduce the notion here, because I think it is at that level that the essential distinction between philosophy and theology is disclosed. In any particular case, practitioners of the two disciplines may or may not differ in the problems to which they address themselves or even in the methods they may employ; typically those may differ as well, but not necessarily. What I am calling the certification oj: truth, however, is distinct not only from the social and personal situation of the thinker but also from the content of his assertions and, most significantly, from the methods by which they are de- rived and from the formal criteria of truth to which they con- form. For within any discipline the methods and criteria are themselves problematic; practitioners of the discipline may dis-</page><page sequence="4">190 SOUNDINGS agree about them and consider it an important part of their task to refine them. But the certification of truth within a discipline cannot be problematic in the same sense, because appeal must be made to it as the implicit justification of methods and criteria. To the extent that philosophy is a theoretical discipline, however, its certification may be logically circular or hypothetical, though not on that account quite empty: If we say that philosophical truth is certified by any rational observer, there is no doubt a problem of circularity in that designation, since the definition of reason is itself a warmly debated issue within the discipline of philosophy. Actually, if the issue did not lie beyond the scope of this paper, I would wish to argue that philosophy is not a purely theoretical discipline and that the process of rationally certifying the meaning of reason is dialectical rather than simply circular. But even if we had to conclude that the certification of philo- sophical truth is purely hypothetical, that no philosophical asser- tion could be absolutely certified, that logically bizarre state of affairs would not prevent the notion of such certification from exercising its important regulative function in defining the dis- cipline of philosophy. Even if the philosopher should have to remain in doubt whether his assertions are in fact true, he would still know what it would mean to make a true assertion. In practice, in actual working methods in philosophy, this ideal of certification by the timeless assemblage of rational ob- servers no doubt functions most directly as a methodological criterion of aesthetic distance. Philosophical "insight" requires such distance, even from the historical situation of the philoso- pher himself. In order to "see into" the situation one's angle of vision cannot be totally immersed in that situation. Even if it is also true that one must be in a situation in order to see it at all, as many modern philosophers have argued, the primary methodological problem is the longstanding one: how neverthe- less to place oneself in some sense outside the situation in order to "see into" it. Philosophers' criticisms of the methods of their predecessors have generally revolved around that problem: that the predecessors had deceived themselves in supposing that they had found a way of achieving the aesthetic distance necessary for genuine "insight," that the older methods for achieving the necessary insight were to some degree bogus. The new method is</page><page sequence="5">FIVE PHILOSOPHICAL POINTS 191 generally proposed as a more authentic way of achieving it, and so lending substance to the appeal to the ideal certification of philosophical truth by the rational observer per se. So much, and so little, by way of clarifying the notion of a philosophical point and at the same time suggesting a view of the philosophical enterprise against which to contrast the mean- ing of theological truth to be developed in the points that follow. 1. Theological truth is certified by the actual religious community in which it is socially and historically situated. It is itself a situated truth. The historical consciousness has by now reached such epidemic proportions that if this first point concerned the process of theo- logical thinking as such it would hardly serve to distinguish it from other kinds of thinking. But theology is not historically situated merely in the trivial sense that theological thinkers are, after all, social beings and show it in the way they think. The point is that its claim to truth is itself historically situated: certi- fied by the testimony of a historical community. For theology is one of the religious functions within an actual religious community. Not that all religions necessarily generate a significant theological function. Like other religious functions, the priestly, the shamanistic, the prophetic, the hymnodic, theol- ogy becomes an important part of the community's religious practice only if it arises from the peculiar exigencies and impulses of that particular community's religious life. The theological func- tion, the religious self-interpretation of the community, develops when a high degree of self-consciousness is, as it were, elicited by the very powers the community celebrates. Indeed, theology is that self-consciousness. Christian theology is the example I have primarily in mind, but to the extent that any religious group is constrained by its own common basis to develop beliefs about that basis itself, there will be a theological task to fulfill. For religious beliefs are not conclusions reached on a cool afternoon. They are implicit in the historical experience and praxis of a community, to be made conscious, as explicit doctrines, in the</page><page sequence="6">192 SOUNDINGS very process by which the community becomes self-conscious. Because of this social character of theology, it must share as fully, precisely as fully, in the intellectual turbulence of the modern situation as the religious communities have shared in its social turbulence. Indeed, the very reference to religious com- munities is already being placed under some strain. Increasingly the pattern of socially cohesive groups, isolated from others, in which people live out most of their lives mutually supported and unchallenged in their religious practice, seems to be dissipating. Without indulging in too much amateur sociology, it is obvious that religious communities are now dispersed into pluralistic professional and social associations, their members actively par- ticipating with others of different persuasion or none at all in projects the commonly acknowledged basis of which has nothing to do with explicitly religious motivation. Not only does theology reflect this complex and unstable state of affairs, but theologians are a clear instance of it, since increasingly the secular university is the milieu in which they work. Even the identification of a religious community with a recognized institution seems to be tenuous in some cases, though the institutional pattern seems to be changing rather than dying. But there are other, less obvious forms of community solidar- ity. A community, let us say, is a group of people who share a common vocabulary of images, concepts, gestures, who identify themselves with a common past and common hopes for the future, who participate in a common musicality. Members of a religious community, in particular, share a sense of fundamental predica- ment in their lives (not merely a recognition of problems to be solved by technical means) , and they share some sense of the powers in which they hope for deliverance. If there were no such community, theology too would be dead. But even in our modern situation communities in this sense are recognizable even when their members do not always mingle intimately in a common space. At any rate the notion of religious community is thoroughly historical; what is meant by it concretely is subject to drastic historical change. And it is fundamental to the discipline of theology that it quite directly reflects such changes, that when it is alive it reflects the effective structure of an actual community as it exists. When the division into sects and denominations was still</page><page sequence="7">FIVE PHILOSOPHICAL POINTS 193 vital in the way Christians identified themselves, theologies too were denominational. But Christian theologians are less and less divided in their thinking by denomination, though they are divided in other ways, because the interpénétrations of effective Christian movements are themselves much more complex and untidy. We have to recognize, not necessarily with sadness, that along with the powerful ecumenical impulse to reconcile ancient divisions there are new alignments into sub-communities, often crossing traditional barriers much more decisively than the official ecumenical movements of the churches; and that many people identify themselves much more vitally with these sub- communities than with the churches that formally claim their allegiance. That these sub-communities are becoming more, rather than less, self-conscious is clear from the fact that they are begin- ning to generate significant theological movements of their own. The testimony of effective Christian communities, though less accessible than formerly as a visible certification of theological truth, is not merely ideal or hypothetical. Unlike the ideal assemblage of rational beings, effective Christian communities are still actual social companies of people, however difficult to recognize they may be. Now I wish to correct a very foolish impression the foregoing comments may have conveyed. I have not meant to suggest that theologians are recording secretaries, or that they arrive at their conclusions by poll. I have been speaking mainly of the theo- logical function itself, which, as war is too important to be left to generals, is too important to be left exclusively to theologians. On the other hand, those who are theologians by vocation may certainly exercise a good deal of originality in what they say, and an important theologian actively moulds the beliefs of his com- munity. Yet even when he is pursuing his own thoughts quite independently, without conscious reference to the community, he does so as a member of it in whom both its faith and its prob- lems and crises are personally alive. He reflects on the predica- ments and powers recognized by his community, not necessarily because he feels constrained to yield to its heteronomous author- ity, but because those are the predicaments and powers with which he himself contends. A vital theology is part of the current scene. It is also in intimate conversation with voices from the com-</page><page sequence="8">194 SOUNDINGS munity's past, for to the extent that the community identifies itself with a historic tradition the theologian recognizes it as his own past. It is an important part of his vocation to interpret his community's historic tradition to the contemporary brotherhood, and indeed he has a great deal to do with the form in which the tradition remains alive in it. Yet he must implicitly appeal to the testimony of the com- munity to certify the truth of his assertions. The effective religious community must sooner or later be able to recognize its own beliefs articulated in his assertions and interpretations, must experience in his words a happy shock of self-recognition: that what the other members had sensed in the experience of the community, past and present, is brought to self-conscious articu- lation in the words of the theologian. An Augustine may in his meditations concern himself with nothing but the soul and God, and yet even his most solitary reflection on these themes will not only be a social act but will implicitly appeal to its certifica- tion in the church's faith. A purely free-lance operator is an im- possible anomaly in theology, and no theologian sets out to be a heretic. Controversy in theology is, to be sure, not unknown! But significant theological controversy is itself situated, reflecting a crisis of identity in the community itself, which must be resolved. The apparent pointlessness of such controversy is nevertheless notorious - among disinterested observers.* For the same reason, disinterested observers will not commonly be impressed with the way theological truth is certified. For it is a situated truth, in which a community lives in history. * Historians have long made merry about the bitter fourth century quar- rel over an iota (homoousion, homoiousion) , but that is only because of a failure to grasp what in fact only gradually dawned on Athanasius himself, that admitting the iota would have been a fatal concession to an altogether pagan spirituality that was in any case threatening quite to drown the church's sense of its own essential drama. The Word which was made flesh must be of the Father's own substance and not merely, in the familiar man- ner of a demigod, a similar substance, divine in a merely generic sense. Generic divinity, perfectly intelligible on classical Greek terms, is a notion altogether alien to the biblical story of the one God active in history, whose inseparable Word was made flesh in the drama celebrated by the church. Athanasius finally came to recognize this apparently hair-splitting issue of the iota as but a new form of the momentous controversy for which he had repeatedly been sent into exile already. So the iota must not be admitted, for whether the church realized it yet or not, what was at stake was nothing less than the basis on which it understood itself to exist.</page><page sequence="9">FIVE PHILOSOPHICAL POINTS 195 2. Theological truth, even when it is universal in its reference and in its intelligibility, is not properly theoretical in character. For it is revealed to active participants within a communal life, and is not as such discoverable by disinterested observation. Philosophical truth, unsituated and therefore unconfined with respect to both time and place, enjoys an ideal universality. For philosophy is not, in the same essential way as theology, a historically situated social function. Though his thinking is also a social activity reflecting his time and place, the philosopher, as such, speaks for no actual community. A philosophical insight may be occasioned by a particular course of events in a particular locality, but the philosopher who formulates it would himself acknowledge that it would be a decisive objection if it were shown to be applicable only to that situation. Like any properly theoretical assertion it must in principle hold for any observer, at any time, anywhere: not merely for every actual observer but for any possible observer. The truth of his assertion must be certified in principle by an ideal observer; he must understand as any (possible) rational being would understand. Even dialectical philosophies, whose universal truths are "concrete," must appeal to this abstract "any" - anyone, any time, anywhere - for their certification of truth.* Theological thinking, situated in time and place, located in its community and participant in its special history, is essentially historical even with respect to its certification of truth. So theo- logical assertions are not properly theoretical: they are certified not by observers, either actual or possible, but by professed par- ticipants in or with the reality to which they testify. Even if the community does not, like classical Christianity, have a highly developed view of revelation, its theology must treat what is * Hegel, for example, oriented his philosophy to history in a self-referen- tial way: Particular historical conditions were necessary in order for it slowly to dawn in consciousness, and its universal judgments were said to be con- crete in the sense that the historical developments out of which they arose were transmuted into dialectical moments within these judgments themselves. But the dialectical moments of a concrete universal are as such ideal, having a purely logical and no longer historical character. Even a dialectical philos- ophy burns the ladder by which it has ascended to the truth, though the steps which the philosopher has taken in his ascent are preserved in it, in the ideal medium of absolute consciousness.</page><page sequence="10">196 SOUNDINGS revealed in the community's life. All such revelation is particular, singling out the community as a historically discrete company of people. Theology arises from the traumas and ecstasies of a his- torical life as detailed and concrete as the peculiar careers of real men; its truth is a particularized truth. Even when philoso- phy, for its part, addresses itself to the most concrete human issues it does not do so from the standpoint of socially situated human beings as such. Philosophical truth is discoverable, in principle, by any observer. Theological truth is not discoverable by an observer at all, but is revealed to participants in the very process of their participation. The universal certification of phil- osophical truth, its accessibility to any observer who masters the disciplines needed to understand, is the basis of that claim to disinterested wisdom which is the peculiar dignity of philosophy. The price it cheerfully pays for this wisdom is abstractness. It is a sound instinct, on the other hand, which has led theologians to eschew worldly wisdom. Still, theological assertions are sometimes mistaken for theo- retical assertions because they are often made in a form that in two respects shares the universality of properly theoretical asser- tions. They are in the first place sometimes universal in their reference. Christians, for example, have claimed that their God is Creator of all things visible and invisible, that all men are sinners, that Christ died for all. Secondly, theological statements are generally made in a universally intelligible form; the meaning of such statements, though not their truth, must be clear to anyone. Theology is not esoteric gnosis. But to assent to these universally applied and universally understandable assertions does require an esoteric condition: the faith that is shared by the community. What essentially distinguishes theological statements from strictly theoretical statements, then, is the basis of their truth- claim. But that distinction frequently, even typically, has ramifi- cations that in practice distinguish theological from theoretical statements in other respects as well. For the difference in certifica- tion commonly does affect the reference and meaning of state- ments. Consider these three statements: 1. All men are mortal. 2. All men are alienated from their human nature.</page><page sequence="11">FIVE PHILOSOPHICAL POINTS 197 3. All men are sinners. Grammatically, the same sort of universal claim seems to be made in each case. But even between 1 and 2 the universality intended is quite different. The first statement (interpreting "mortal" as "liable to die," i.e., in a sense unaffected by the immortalizing facilities of refrigeration, etc.) seems to be true by definition, and therefore to apply to any possible instance of the set "men." (If you think it doesn't, then for "mortal" read a term that more obviously does, like "mammals.") The second, on the contrary, is by no means self-evident in that tautological sense, and there- fore does not necessarily apply to all possible men. It applies to men in existing or past societies, perhaps to all the men who have ever actually lived. This idea of alienation has been proposed by some nineteenth and twentieth century philosophers on the basis of a complex dialectical argument, and implies a notion of human nature and a particular analysis of social history. No doubt a man who believes it is true must depend in the end on his social experience as well as his acceptance of the dialectical arguments. Still, philosophers who claim that all men are alienated must suppose that any rational being who follows the argument and makes the relevant observations would be constrained to agree. So our second statement is properly theoretical, and therefore provides an illuminating contrast with the third, particularly since it is historically related to the third: it was a Hegelian transmutation into philosophy, into a thesis in the philosophy of history, of the theological dogma of original sin. But the transmutation has altered the meaning of its universality at every point. The universality of the third statement differs from that of either the first or the second. The Augustinián theologian does not understand it to be true by definition; it indeed implies, like the second statement, a deviation in men's existential condi- tion from human nature. Yet it is not a generalization about actual societies, past and present, to be tested finally by examina- tion of available evidence. For the statement means that it is inconceivable that any actual person who might ever exist would elude the toils of sin - though not, as in the case of 1, out of simple logical necessity. The universality of this third statement has a peculiar logical position that makes impossible an appeal either to the logical acuity or the observations of the ideal</page><page sequence="12">198 SOUNDINGS assemblage of rational beings to certify its truth, and even its meaning is therefore paradoxical. It applies to every actual son of Adam who will ever have lived, and not merely to those who have in fact lived, nor necessarily to every instance of the set "men" which is conceivable. 3. Theological truth concerns the reality by which the religious community believes itself constituted: a transcendent reality at least in the sense that it is not identical with the community as such, or with any of its social or religious functions. This third point may seem to retract the first two, but in fact it follows from the situated position of the community and of its theological function that we have been exploring in the first two points. Though theological truth is certified by the community, its effective criterion cannot be the sheer social fact, as such, of the community's belief. Just because it is itself a socially situated activity, part of the community's religious life, a theology cannot regard the features of that religious life as social facts. For facts exist only for observers: "fact" is a theoretical category.* Theol- ogy knows no facts. Yet something does play a role in theological thinking that is analogous to the role of facts in theoretical inter- pretation. Theology concerns itself with the reality by which its community understands itself to be constituted and with which it is conscious of contending in its historical life. Indeed, theology is the community's very consciousness of that putative reality. For a community's practical religious sense of orientation is logically prior to any such theological self-consciousness. The reality to which it is practically oriented is present, already given, * A fact is the irreducible determination by an observer of what is the case. Theoretical interpretations must "square with the facts" though in most cases a variety of interpretations is possible even when there is no serious disagreement about the facts. So the apparent givenness and irreducibili ty of the facts make it easy to forget that the very category of "fact" has meaning only within the procedures of theoretical interpretation, that like the inter- pretive models this category is a construct employed by observers as such. The point is not that facts exist only in the eye of the beholder, that they have no extra-mental reference, but that they exist qua facts only for the eye of a possible beholder.</page><page sequence="13">FIVE PHILOSOPHICAL POINTS 199 in the sense of life out of which doctrinal belieb are articulated. Orientation to this reality is the ground, not the consequent, of theological thinking. More specifically, it seems that in every self-conscious awaken- ing a religious faith finds itself already possessed by both a sub- jective structure and an objective intentionality. Its subjective structure is its complex sense of its own human reality, typically dominated by some intractable predicament: by the sense of finitude or temporality, or the sense of imprisonment or estrange- ment, or the sense of sin. In each case, to be sure, this is a name given to a particular sense of predicament, but the naming is not arbitrary or indifferent; the predicament to which different com- munities awaken is not necessarily the same. Certainly conscious- ness is already active in any such sense of the human condition, and the consciousness is undoubtedly social before it is self- conscious. It is not merely an interpretation of the human con- dition, because interpretation arises only with self-consciousness. The subjective structure is already a structure of consciousness, but a man has no more primitive or elemental relationship to his own reality than this sense of himself to which he awakens religiously, no independent access to his own reality by which he might test it. The subjective structure of religious faith is already there when he awakens, to be discovered and interpreted as soon as consciousness turns reflexively back on itself. But even more fundamental than this subjective structure of religious consciousness is what we have called its objective intentionality. When the religious consciousness turns reflexively back on itself, it discovers itself standing in relation to another, to a potency, concentrated or distributed, transcending itself and its social milieu as such. This relation is, in the phenomenological sense, intentional. Consciousness intends this objective potency, is directed to it, its horizon is filled by it. Indeed, this conscious- ness is aware of its proximate objects - including itself, when it becomes, reflexively, an object to itself - only in relation to this ultimate potency. Even what we have called its subjective structure is altogether intentional in the sense that it is formed by the activity in which it is directed to its object. Isaiah sees the Lord, high and lifted up, before he is able, when he turns the light of consciousness back on himself, to discover himself</page><page sequence="14">200 SOUNDINGS as a man of unclean lips in the midst of a people of unclean lips. The sense of predicament corresponds negatively to the specific sense of objective potency in which consciousness is directed. But of course the self-identity that is evoked in this intentional relationship is neither static nor merely negative, is not a fixed sense of predicament. Just because it is intentionally directed toward the objective power against which its predicament is determined, the subjective structure is plastic, already in process of overcoming the predicament: faith is a quest, and a venture into self-transformation. The paradoxical situation seems to be that a man becomes conscious of the human predicament only when he believes himself to be in process of being delivered from it. The human reality to which the religious self-consciousness awakens is itself a self-transcending process, because the putative reality to which its intentionality is directed is altogether tran- scendent-transcendent at least in the sense that it is not part of or identical with the community in which religious life is situated. This reality transcends the community, because the community is, in its religious understanding of itself, constituted by it.# * Only in a loose sense can the community as such be said to be self- conscious: its members so identify themselves with it that their own religious identity is inseparable from their belief in the divinely constituted basis of the community. But since the distinction between consciousness and self- consciousness is so crucial in the foregoing discussion, it may be useful to consider the matter in stricter terms. It is plausible that consciousness as such may in a strict sense be communal, intending its objects through socially shared symbolic forms. But it does not seem plausible to speak in the same way of a communal self-consciousness, because consciousness seems to be in- dividuated in the very process of becoming reflexive. The self as an individu- ated subject is singled out when consciousness is turned back upon itself. It is, to be sure, conscious of itself as a social being, identifying itself in relation to its community, but this very act of self-consciousness also singles the self out within its community. That is why we have had to speak in terms of an in- dividuated consciousness in those last three paragraphs: not because the re- ligious consciousness is itself necessarily individuated- it generally seems on the contrary to be communal- but because its intentional structure is acces- sible only when it has become self-aware, and hence individuated. That would be a serious problem if our primary task were to discuss the religious consciousness as such, in its diverse forms. But we are interested here in the religious consciousness only insofar as it gives rise to theological thinking, which is precisely the religious self-consciousness. Though theological thinking is situated in community, it does not necessarily appear in all religious com- munities. As I have suggested, the theological function arises with religious self-consciousness. It therefore presupposes individuation.</page><page sequence="15">FIVE PHILOSOPHICAL POINTS 201 To specify the meaning of this transcendence further is a primary task of theology. Its truth is a transcendent truth: the reality by which its community is constituted. Precisely because theology is a function of religious community, a distinction must be made between the implicit certification of its truth by the community and, on the other hand, its ultimate truth itself which must directly and explicitly provide the criterion for any of the assertions incorporated into the substance of theology. Theology would betray the very community which certifies it if it were to view that reality purely as a socio-historical phenomenon. Not that theology is by any means unconscious of its relation to its community. The community which certifies it must also find place in the substance of theology, i.e., must be understood theologically. Christian theologies, for example, generally include a doctrine of the church, but as in the historic creeds it is treated in light of the primary articles, the belief in God, in the incar- nation, in the economy of salvation from sin. For only from these primary articles can there emerge what the historic Christian community believes about itself. Belief in the incarnate God may control the whole substance of Christian theology, but this christological criterion does not contradict the claim that the community which understands its own existence only in light of the incarnation must for that very reason supply the implicit certification of truth in all Christian theology. Other disciplines concern themselves with religious commu- nities and functions, but study them in a theoretical, yea, even "scientific" way, e.g., the sociology of religion, the psychology of religion, perhaps the history of religions. Just because such dis- ciplines are properly theoretical, viewing religious communities from an aesthetic distance, they do not in their own orientation as disciplines share either the subjective structure or the objective intentionality of the communities they study. That is why they cannot, as such, credit theological truth claims concerning alleged transcendent realities. They should perhaps by the same token not deny these claims either, but there are cases on record in which practitioners of these disciplines, Ockham's razor in hand, have seemed to do so. Since such disciplines are not them- selves historically and socially situated in the essential way theol- ogy is, they are able to treat religious communities and their functions as purely socio-historical phenomena. They may of</page><page sequence="16">202 SOUNDINGS course take note of religious beliefs in transcendent reality, but may regard the holding of such beliefs purely as facts about the believers. The same is true of the philosophy of religion, to the extent that it is a theoretical discipline, even if it is not committed, as some philosophies of religion are, to purely empirical methods. A philosopher of religion as such, however sympathetic to theo- logical traditions, must treat them at an aesthetic distance from the historical communities to which theologies are directly re- sponsible.* A philosophy of religion may indeed explore religious claims with respect to transcendent reality, but must establish the truth of such claims on grounds quite independent of those a theology employs. For its part, theology is on its own terms justified in denying that the concreteness of religious truth is accessible to any theo- retical and therefore unsituated discipline. It may with due gratitude make its own uses of various theoretical investigations into its milieu, but it may be excused if its interest in such disciplines is more or less like that of lovers in the science of biology. 4. The form of religious truth reflects the essentially narrative character of primary religious expressions. * There are, of course, historic philosophical traditions, but they do not define actual historical communities of which a philosopher must consider himself a part. While, therefore, a philosopher may be nourished by a philo- sophical tradition, he is not responsible to it in the way that the theologian is responsible to his historic tradition. Theology must certainly interpret its own history, and may do so critically, but it interprets it theologically- not to be confused with historical interpretation of theology- because to a signifi- cant degree the historic tradition defines the community in which the theol- ogy is situated. Even a philosophy may only up to a point interpret the philosophical tradition with which it identifies itself in a purely historical way. If it should accept a historico-reductive interpretation of philosophy it would fall into intractable problems of self-reference, like the Cretan who says all Cretans are liars. If a theologian accepted any such interpretation of his theological tradition, he would not only fall into this self-referential problem, but much more seriously would be implicitly denying any league with transcendence for his own historic community, of which that theological tradition had been a function.</page><page sequence="17">FIVE PHILOSOPHICAL POINTS 203 A corollary of the third point we have just finished discussing is a paradoxical-sounding but not really paradoxical assertion: Just because a religious community is essentially historical, it cannot reflect its own historicity by offering a purely historical interpretation of itself. It does so in another way, in the form in which its beliefs are given their primary expression. This primary expression is story telling. It is no accident that the recital and ritual reenactment of stories plays such a central part in the life of religious communities. Not only are their ancient traditions preserved primarily in stories, but the narrative form reproduces the texture of historical and personal life, as a sequence of events. People in religious communities, indeed, commonly understand their lives as recapitulations of archetypal stories, which reveal special significance in experienced events. A dis- tinguishing mark of a community, as distinct from a casual or accidental assemblage of people, is that its members share a sense of participating in a common story. In religious communities in particular, all typical forms of religious expression, lyrical, didactic, legal, cultic, sacramental, etc., are related to episodes in particular cycles of stories. That is also true of theological beliefs, which are primarily interpretations of the stories. Even in its most abstract expressions theology reveals its sources in such stories. That is why theologians are apt, for ex- ample, to employ the sort of temporal and personal language in speaking of deity that so offends some philosophers. God wills, hates, loves, creates, destroys, delivers, acts. Such language, usually designated anthropomorphic, might more precisely be called narrative. It obviously derives from cycles of stories rather than from bodies of theory. It is difficult to know what to make of it according to timeless criteria of truth. But for the theologian it is inescapable, unless he is bent on philosophical respectability at all costs. For it reflects the temporality of a community's his- torical experience of the transcendence which has engaged it, indeed the temporality of the stories, the poetically rendered sequence of events, to which its members awaken when their sense of religious identity is born. The believing Hebrew awakens to his identity in a community which Yahweh has delivered from bondage, led through the wilderness, and joined in everlasting covenant at Sinai. The Christian is baptized into the death and</page><page sequence="18">204 SOUNDINGS resurrection of Christ and received into a church formed by the Spirit at Pentecost. So long as his work remains a vital function of such a community, the theologian cannot entirely launder away the narrative locutions that cling to his language. Even if he employs a statement that is susceptible of meta- physical interpretation, such as "God is good/' his language can- not conceal the fact that the divine goodness is in its primitive meaning exhibited in stories of God acting rather than in timeless definitions of the divine being. Again, recalling our earlier com- parison of apparently universal anthropological statements, we may note that sin is an act, the archetype of which assumes the form of a haunting story set in a garden of dreamlike familiarity: sin is an act, and not, like mortality or alienation, a state of being or a state of existence. For similar reasons, the stupifying declaration that "God is dead" is intelligible only on theological grounds. From any philo- sophical standpoint it is sheer nonsense. God either is or is not. He cannot once have lived and now be dead, in sequence, as though he were involved in - a kind of story! A religious com- munity, on the contrary, may reject that reading of its story, may condemn it as blasphemous, but cannot simply dismiss it as silly. It is obviously a confessional statement that some theologians have been constrained to make, because it is a story they believe themselves to have lived through. And not themselves only: the response they have received from many serious Christians and Jews is a sign that they have been speaking for a hitherto inchoate sub-community of people who vaguely shared their sense that the Judaeo-Christian story had taken an extraordinary turn and who have discovered in the words of these theologians the voice of their own religious self-consciousness. 5. Theological truth has a broadly political character, and there- fore theological reflection aims at collusiveness even though it is never in fact concluded. By the political character of theology, I mean that it attempts to articulate and to mold the common commitments of an actual</page><page sequence="19">FIVE PHILOSOPHICAL POINTS 205 community of people: a common self-understanding, a common devotion, common aims and values. Theological truth does not describe or explain, it does not so much offer insight into a situa- tion but informs the activities of living in a situation. It articu- lates the grounds out of which projects are pursued in faith. Though it speaks of the divine it does not describe the divine but "answers to" the divine, and articulates the sense of an identity lived in face of the divine through the temporality of action and experience. That is why it preserves its narrative locutions even in its most elaborated constructions. It is a mobilizing activity, conducted under the pressure of urgent social tensions. It there- fore presses for conclusions, preserving its mysteries but forever undertaking to resolve those questions that leave its community in a state of uncertainty with respect to its own identity or with respect to an urgent challenge to its contemporary life. Yet its questions never turn out to have been finally closed in fact, and the reason for that is again political, historical: Since the com- munity is a historical entity its changing situation requires that its questions be constantly posed afresh, on different terms. The vitality of the community's historical experience forever outruns the theological impulse to mobilize it. Philosophy seems to exhibit a similar embarrassment, but the similarity between the two cases is only apparent. Philosophy also undertakes to answer its own questions, but with no such political motivation in view, and therefore without the same historical urgency. The philosopher wishes to understand; the wisdom to which he aspires is such as an ideal observer might enjoy. As Socrates says (Repub. VI, 486a) , the philosopher's soul is constantly grasping after the whole of things, both human and divine, and his contemplation (theoria) embraces all time and all existence. Or as Aristotle says (Metaph. I, 982a) of the wise man, he knows all things, as far as possible, but not each thing in detail - to which we might add that the practical urgency is in the details. Yet the philosopher remains, after all, a lover of wisdom rather than one who understands in a final sense. The reason his desire is never fully satisfied, but remains the eros of philosophical pursuit, stems from the dialectical nature of that pursuit. Every understanding achieved raises new questions and reopens afresh the problem with which it began.</page><page sequence="20">206 SOUNDINGS So openness and closure do not have the same basis in theology and in philosophy. Theology aims essentially at closure, but its historicity keeps it open. Philosophy is, in the very dialectical nature of its inquiry, an open pursuit, though the philosopher is driven by his divine eros to answer his questions. The Christian doctrine of sin, for example, is in certain respects paradoxical, but it is not dialectical. The theologian who addresses himself to it is not engaging in disinterested inquiry, but striving for a definite self-understanding. Yet even if a philosopher of religion were as convinced as Calvin was that man is a sinner from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet, he would remain dis- creetly silent about this conviction in his philosophical reflections. For such an idea is too earnest to enable him to preserve the aesthetic distance that keeps his ideas dialectically in motion, whereas the ontological argument for the existence of God is just playful and innocent enough to keep his whole world of ideas dancing in endless dialectical transport. The so-called Averroists of the thirteenth century were con- demned for allegedly asserting a doctrine of double truth, that statements could be theologically true which were philosophically false and vice versa. Whether the thinkers so accused were indeed Averroists in this sense is a historical question we need not settle. But I have argued that there is a sense in which the view con- demned as Averroist is correct. Even when theological and philo- sophical statements do not formally conflict, they appeal to quite different notions of truth, corresponding to the decisive difference between the two disciplines in their relation to history. So I have specified some important differences between them which make theological truth unphilosophical. I have not meant to deny that there can be significant conversation or even partner- ship between the two disciplines, of which there is of course a long history. Their very difference suggests the possibility of a fruitful complementary relationship, e.g., between the dialectical openness of philosophy and the situated concreteness, definiteness, seriousness of theology. But the relationship can exist on many</page><page sequence="21">FIVE PHILOSOPHICAL POINTS 207 different terms, and will perhaps always have a certain ad hoc character. Its history certainly does not suggest any one general basis for it. Nevertheless, it is even possible for the two disciplines to function in fruitful rhythm in the thinking of a single man, if they are not made to neutralize one another in spurious syn- thesis. There are indeed some of us for whom the two disciplines are the irregular systole and diastole of our intellectual pulse. Like Socrates, and perhaps with more cause, we are often uncertain whether we are monsters more complicated and passionate than the serpent Typhon or creatures of a gentler and simpler sort, to whom nature has given a diviner and lowlier destiny (Phaedrus, 229-30) . To cover our confusion we have in these latter days affected a Janus-like composite discipline which we call philo- sophical theology. Our embarrassment is sometimes acute. Still, Janus, with his two faces turned in opposite directions, was the god of gates and doors, and of all beginnings. I have proceeded as I have here with the notion that a door must be properly closed before it can be opened again, and a new beginning made.</page></plain_text>
