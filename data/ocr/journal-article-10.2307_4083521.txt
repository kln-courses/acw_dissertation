Zool., 79: 1-132, text figs., tables, 3 pls. $3.50.-This monograph is the result of an intensive field study of the Bicolored Antbird, Gymnopithys bicolor, primarily on Barro Colorado Island in the Panama Canal Zone, and secondarily in other parts of Panama and in Costa Rica and Colombia. The description of behavior includes information on intraspecific relationships, interactions with other species, and the very important association with swarms of army ants that this species follows. The study is thorough, the methods followed seem rigorous, including the color-banding of 109 individuals, and the discussion is stimulating, bearing on basic problems in behavior and ecology where appropriate. In the body of the text are 9 tables and 21 figures, plus additional tables in the appendices, and sonograms at the end of the volume describing vocalizations of this and associated species. The figures are generally well-executed in scale and clarity, and the volume has been fairly well proofread. Feather postures are important components of displays. The author commendably extends the method used by Brown (Univ. California Publ. Zool., 60: 223-328, 1964, omitted from the reference list) of estimating angular changes in feather erection to describe feather postures on different parts of the body. This method is used in place of Morris's (Behaviour, 9: 75-113, 1956) earlier categories. Often no quantita- tive measure of erection is used, feather areas being described as fluffed. From de- scription and figures this term seems to cover both fluffed and ruffled, sensu Morris. It would have been better to have adhered to his nomenclature where a more accurate measure is not practical.</page><page sequence="2">362 Reviews [Auk, Vol. 86 No reference is made to Andrew's classic paper (Behaviour, 10: 179-204, 1956) in the discussion of possible phylogenetic (and ecological) significance of different kinds of tail movement. A comparison of his categories with those in the present paper could have made an interesting discussion even more useful. The author considers that Brown and Hunsperger's (Anim. Behav., 11: 439-448, 1963) critique of motivational conflict theory may make such an analysis of be- havior seem superfluous. Rowell's (Anim. Behav., 12: 535-537, 1964) strong criticism of that paper, or neurophysiological studies that tend to support this type of analysis, should also be mentioned, in order to draw attention to the still con- troversial nature of the topic. Form and context analysis is often used in attempts to discover the origin of display components, to provide evidence about the causal basis of a display, and to elucidate display function. In the present paper Tinbergen's form analysis is applied to a study of motivational conflict underlying agonistic displays. It is concluded that although "mixed displays" may be typical for gulls and many other birds, they are rare in Bicolored Antbirds, the displays of which are "pure in form." It is not clear to me whether this distinction is based on the derivation of display components or on conflict in motivation underlying the display. These two kinds of interpretation are based on different assumptions and should be considered separately. This section might well have been expanded. Two types of agonistic behavior are suggested: the "cybernetic" type characteristic of Bicolored Antbirds, and the "militaristic" type found in gulls. In the former "aggressive and attack behavior lead to positive feedback in the opponent, away from or past the standard posture to high intensities of aggression or submission; submissive or escape behavior leads to negative feedback, toward the standard posture." In the militaristic type "attack behavior leads to attack, or to escape by the opponent; escape behavior leads to escape; and mixed behavior gives mixed results." Under given conditions responses of Bicolored Antbirds and gulls certainly differ, but these two types of agonistic behavior do not seem mutually exclusive. The loose territoriality of Bicolored Antbirds, in which intruders are not ef- fectively excluded, permits both spacing out of nesting pairs (the advantages and disadvantages of this are discussed) and at the same time allows efficient utilization of a moving food source-invertebrates flushed by nomadic army ant swarms. The consequences of loose territoriality, and of the dominance relationship among Bi- colored Antbirds at swarms, on the agonistic repertory of the species are discussed. Comparison of territoriality in related species of antbirds with the degree of speciali- zation in following army ants suggests a derivation of loose territoriality from the classical territoriality more common among passerines. A "dominance reversal" definition of territory is offered, modifying Emlen's (Ibis, 99: 352, 1957) definition to read: "a space in which one animal or group generally dominates others which become dominant elsewhere." The dominance reversal con- cept has the advantages of including cases where a distinct boundary may not obtain, emphasizing the dynamic nature of territories, and stressing the complementary roles of dominance and subordinance in effecting such a system. The author combines keen insight and good field work with attention to basic questions upon which his data bear. The result is an important contribution to our understanding of the Formicariidae and of neotropical ornithology. Unfortunately the anthropomorphic style of much of the description detracts from the impact that a study of this nature should have.-D. W. DUNHAM.</page></plain_text>
