            <title>1. Big Historicism</title>
            <p>According to Wai Chee Dimock, scholars of American literature should study it in a
                bigger historical context than the one beginning in 1776 or even 1620, freeing
                themselves in this way from the narrow-minded nationalism that has so often drawn a
                border around their research. To view American literature in light of the longer
                    <italic>durée</italic> of ancient civilizations is to see Henry David
                Thoreau reading the <italic>Bhagavad Gita</italic>, Ralph Waldo Emerson the Persian
                poet Hāfez, and rediscover in these and other extensive sympathies the kinship
                of American literature with world literature. Dramatically expanding the tracts of
                space-time across which literary scholars might draw valid links between author and
                author, text and text, and among author, text, and the wide world beyond, the
                perspective of deep time holds the additional promise, for Dimock, of reinvigorating
                “our very sense of the connectedness among human beings” and of
                dissuading us, thereby, from the wisdom of war.1 At the very least we might hope that American soldiers wouldn't
                look idly on, as they did on 14 April 2003, as the cultural treasures of the Iraqi
                National Library—which are the treasures of all humankind—were looted
                and burned.</p>
            <p>Dimock's <italic>Through Other Continents</italic> is among the most prominent
                but also most unusual works of the transnational turn in literary studies, and one
                way of beginning to discern its originality is to run through a checklist of readily
                offered objections to the way its argument is framed. For starters there is the
                historical materialist objection, which casts an ironic light on events like those
                of 14 April 2003, when some ancient “documents of civilization,” as
                Walter Benjamin called them, finally became victims of the same
                “barbarism” of which they were originally made.2 Refusing to contemplate that original horror, Dimock would
                seem from this perspective to want to acquit culture of its complicity in historical
                violence, dissolving it in a “deep time” now recognizable as
                    <italic>aestheticized</italic> time, time stretched beyond the bounds of any
                obvious social utility or statute of limitations. And what about the book's
                subtitle, <italic>American Literature across Deep Time</italic>? Djelal Kadir has
                noted how, rather than pointing us to the crossing of American literature
                    <italic>by</italic> deep time, as the book often compellingly does, this
                formulation lends to American literature itself the capacity for exploratory
                movement across a time span in which it mostly did not exist to do any such
                    exploring.3 Thus, although it hoists the
                flag of the peacekeeper, the book could be said to keep a token of imperial
                nostalgia in the hold. If the idea is to plumb the depths of deep time, why not
                scrap the idea of “American literature” altogether?</p>
            <p>Something similar might be said in the idiom of the New Historicism, whose temporal
                measurement protocols Dimock would seem in particular to be calling into question.
                There, as exemplified by the invocation of a calendar date in the first sentence of
                so many historicist essays, the goal has been to locate the intersection of
                disparate discourses in as thin a slice of the history being studied as possible,
                exposing the interlacing of literary texts with the institutional powers that
                discipline, punish, and pleasure the human bodies alive at a certain time and place.
                Seen in the klieg lights of what we can now call shallow time, Dimock's
                assertion that “deep time is denationalized space” (<italic>T,</italic>
                p. 28) could itself be historicized as the utterance of a particular historical
                situation—the dark heart of the second Bush administration on the one hand,
                the liberal humanist academy on the other. Given the powerlessness of literary
                intellectuals to shape that situation in any noticeable way, it's a small
                wonder that the agonized complicities of this period inspire a search for paths of
                symbolic escape. Its vehicle, in Dimock, is the institution of literature, whose
                political, economic, and other practicalities recede in her account to become a
                remarkably frictionless conduit of transnational sympathy and identification. And it
                is here that still another ready line of critique—a media theoretical
                critique—might present itself. The emphases of scholars like Friedrich
                Kittler, Siegfried Zielinski, and N. Katherine Hayles have each been somewhat
                different, but all have sought a revelation of the device of cultural history,
                asking us to consider again the ways in which the medium has been the message.4 Faced with arguments that leap from Margaret
                Fuller to ancient Egypt, and from <italic>Gilgamesh</italic> to Henry James, a
                contemporary media theorist might be compelled to note how tenuously materialized
                Dimock's connections across deep time appear to be. What about the media of
                transmission from Hāfez to Emerson and from Emerson to us? What about the long
                chain of objects, institutions, and techniques that may have had their own agendas
                in that meeting of minds? What story does this hardware tell? The Kittlerian might
                say that if the materiality of the media were taken seriously enough, then we would
                see Dimock's deep time humanism as a sort of sentimental mist given off by
                remorselessly technical processes of information storage and retrieval.</p>
            <p>All of these objections are persuasive to some degree and help us to understand what
                Dimock's argument for deep time most problematically entails, but none of them
                is able to hold on to the new conceptual territory brought into focus in her
                audacious lens shifting of literary history. And yet that territory is the scene of
                a series of methodological provocations regarding time and context whose interest
                extends even beyond the new literary critical transnationalism, contributing to
                another recent turn in literary studies. Visible in the rise of neurological affect
                theory, cognitive cultural studies, literary Darwinism, and various forms of
                quantitative formalism, this is the turn toward science both as a cultural
                historical datum and a possible methodological resource for humanistic research. In
                Dimock's version, while she doesn't use the term, the sciences of
                complexity appear to have come to the fore, helping her to weave themes from
                geometry, geography, and ecological systems theory into readings of American
                literary texts that stress their “fractal” connectedness to other texts
                at other places and times (“T,” p. 75).5 The appeal of fractal geometry, in this instance, would appear to be
                what Albert-László Barabási called its “scale-free”
                nature—the same lovely (and appealingly organic-looking) patterns repeating
                themselves at all levels of observation, from the very small to the very large.6 This is taken as an image at once of
                kinship-at-a-distance and of the reassuring persistence of a diversity of nooks and
                crannies abolished in traditional Euclidian constructions.</p>
            <p>To be sure, there is ample room for skepticism that a formal system elaborated, as
                fractal geometry has been, with an eye to drawing more and more of an otherwise
                messy material world under the jurisdiction of mathematics has any intrinsically
                peaceful implications. And yet Dimock deserves considerable credit for broaching the
                issue of scale in literary studies so boldly, and she is not alone in wanting, in
                this time of disciplinary duress, to find scientific sanction for the benefits of
                literature. Indeed, as is most evident in literary Darwinist models of scientific
                criticism, one of the striking things about the work being done in the new
                scientific spirit is how <italic>literature positive</italic> it tends to be.
                Attributing a broadly “adaptive” value to storytelling, the study of
                literature can become a form of approval again, just as it had been under the New
                Criticism; much of the native skepticism one associates with scientific inquiry has
                been displaced onto those who place too much faith in the powers of social
                construction to determine literary value. Dimock refrains from the sneering
                dismissal of ideology critique—in particular feminist ideology
                critique—one finds among the Darwinists, but her arguments-from-complexity are
                just as challenging to the critical status quo as theirs.7 The time-scales of criticism are only one object of her
                intervention into the question of scale and culture, but after Dimock it should be
                more difficult to look at the habits of historical literary scholarship without
                seeing their potential for a fetishistic apotheosis of the calendar, as though time
                could attain a kind of retrojected presence in the date book of our interpretations.
                It should be more difficult to forget that long duration is every bit as
                “historical” as rapid change or, if you prefer, that the scale at which
                we discern that change can itself be quite variable, depending on the measurement
                    protocol.8 Distinguishing her work from
                most other contributions to the new transnationalism, Dimock's insights into
                the quantitative elasticity of the period are arguably more radical than her
                arguments for spatial expansion, and they would be missed in a simple retrenchment
                in the historical moment.</p>
            <p>It's more productive, I think, to come at the question of deep time from the
                opposite perspective, accepting Dimock's challenge to think the periodicity of
                literary history on a new and larger scale but altering our conceptual orientation
                to that largeness such that the failure of institutions it predicts—and of
                which the fall of the Iraqi National Museum is just one spectacularly depressing
                example—comes into view. This is a project I call the posthuman comedy, a
                critical fiction meant to draw together a number of modern literary works in which
                scientific knowledge of the spatiotemporal vastness and numerousness of the nonhuman
                world becomes visible as a formal, representational, and finally existential
                problem. It will be aided, first, simply by radicalizing Dimock's expansion of
                the timeframe in which we view the institution of literature, reclaiming the term
                    <italic>deep time</italic> from her essentially Braudelian usage, which makes it
                synonymous with a historical <italic>longue durée</italic> measured, at most,
                in thousands of years. Here instead we will insist upon its original geological
                    meaning.9 Whether it is the 13.7 thousand
                million years since the Big Bang, or the 3.5 thousand million years in which life on
                earth has been evolving, or for that matter the 4.5 thousand million years from now
                until the earth is incinerated in the heat-death of the sun, the deep time of the
                earth sciences is difficult to integrate into even the most capacious visions of
                civilizational, national, or institutional continuity.</p>
            <p>This half-acknowledged truth hovers in the background of Dimock's otherwise
                optimistic account of literature's ability to bridge time, casting the shadow
                of death upon it, and our ghoulish task here will be to draw a kind of chalk outline
                around that shadow. For her, our biological “fallibility” as individuals
                is redeemed by the fact that we can “count on the species as a whole to serve
                as a … vast, ever-expanding, and ever-receptive archive, compiling and
                collating all that we have done and all that we would ever want to do. Human beings
                are the only creatures on the planet who reproduce through archives”
                    (<italic>T,</italic> pp. 57–58). But never mind how this formulation seems
                to leave beyond critical purview the long history of <italic>ignoring</italic>,
                    <italic>forgetting,</italic> and <italic>erasing;</italic> surely the flow of
                deep time, while it might provide occasion for overcoming some of humanity's
                limitations, is also a problem in its own right, holding the virtual certainty of
                extinction? No doubt it poses a great representational challenge to literature,
                whose most epic productions are, matched against deep time, what Italo Calvino might
                call cosmicomically small.10 For Dimock, the
                genre of the epic appeals as a form longer-lived than any nation, and too large not
                to have absorbed all manner of alterity into its linguistic fabric. For her this is
                true of all major genres, whose bounds always exceed the borders of nations.11 In the posthuman comedy, as we shall see,
                another implication of genre surges to the fore—the one operant in the term
                    <italic>genre fiction</italic> (its science fiction and horror variants in
                particular) that names those literary forms willing to risk artistic ludicrousness
                in their representation of the inhumanly large and long. For all of its investments
                in canonical texts, <italic>Through Other Continents</italic> might itself be seen
                as a critical science fiction in this sense, blowing open the doors of disciplinary
                historicism to the outsize wilds of time travel.</p>
            <p>Once upon a time the posthuman comedy had been a more serious affair, an occasion for
                rhetorical elevation under the sign of the sublime. And while Edmund Burke's
                empiricist account of sublimity is still serviceable in the explication of generic
                horror, the more prestigious Kantian formalist version we associate so easily with
                romantic poetry is, by its lights, suspiciously dignifying of the human. Aggrieved
                partisans of genre fiction are forever lobbying for its recognition as serious
                literature, which is fine, but it is just as important to draw the philosophical
                lesson embedded in its apparent lowliness, which points altogether beyond the pale
                of aesthetic redemption. In the clutches of the outsize realism of science fiction
                and horror, the two-stage Kantian sublime—<italic>first</italic> the failure
                of the senses in the face of the very large, <italic>then</italic> the triumph of
                reason in the concept of infinity—enters into a third stage, unable now to
                shake the knowledge that reason, too, is sure to be engulfed in a larger darkness.
                That time will be the time not only of our death but of the death of death and the
                concept of infinity, too. Even Jean-Paul Sartre, author of “Existentialism Is
                a Humanism” (1946), granted the logical force of this posthumanist
                perspective. In a famous essay on William Faulkner he critiques the conception of
                time as a futureless void that he finds in <italic>The Sound and the Fury</italic>
                (1929), judging it false to the inherently anticipatory nature of consciousness. For
                him, Faulkner's narratives have the same effect of looking backward out of a
                speeding convertible; the past gains clarity as it recedes, the peripheral present
                is a fractured jumble, and the future cannot be seen at all. This, for Sartre, is
                artistically interesting but philosophically false, since we live into the future
                regardless. And yet he concedes that “if we begin by plunging [man] into
                universal time, the time of nebulae and planets, of tertiary formations and of
                animal species, as in a bath of sulfuric acid,” well then, yes, “the
                time of man will [seem to be] without a future.”12 Seen in a large enough time frame, Hāfez and Emerson appear as
                contemporaries. Seen in a larger one still, they and their kind barely appear at
                all.</p>
            <p>Why, though, would one want to take this conspicuously impractical, if not simply
                pointless perspective, which Sartre shrugs off so easily? Certainly there is much to
                be said philosophically for resisting the demand for relevance embodied in such a
                question, which accedes too quickly to the pragmatic voluntarism (as though we
                simply choose our relation to time) whose limits any critical posthumanism would
                want to explore.13 Another response, more
                important to my purposes here, would be more methodological in character and would
                stand partly in agreement with the judgment that deep time is irrelevant. And yet
                the point would be that the establishment of a boundary between the relevant and
                irrelevant is an achievement we shouldn't take for granted. This is especially
                true in the condition of modernity in the broadest sense, one of whose features has
                been a continuing expansion of the range of potential human empirical observation,
                from the subatomic to the cosmic realms, while in between these extremes our
                attention span now ranges easily from the profoundly local to the promiscuously
                global. In such a world, the natural-historical and political-economic process of
                distinguishing the relevant from the irrelevant is a complex dialectical negotiation
                of competing drives toward expansion and contraction.</p>
            <p>In stark contrast to the scale-free nature of fractal patterning, here a change in
                scale often matters greatly—much as it does, for instance, in the sciences of
                biology and engineering, which have had reason to notice that things cannot be
                scaled dramatically up or down without also dramatically changing their design. To
                take a fetching example from Stephen Jay Gould, the gigantic insects of B-movie fame
                are a physical impossibility; they would collapse on their spindly legs.14 And isn't the same true of the scale of
                our social identifications? In any case, the face-to-face interaction of the small
                group would seem to be importantly different, in its physical intimacy, from social
                forms that only exist by means of symbolic and technological mediation. What's
                more, the same drive toward an extension of sympathy with the geohistorical other we
                find in Dimock, unchecked, might become sympathy with the
                    <italic>absolutely</italic> other, with the 13.7 thousand-million-year history
                of (for the most part) utter indifference to life we find in the geological and
                cosmic records. Thus when confronted with entreaties, like Dimock's, to think
                big, it seems fair to ask from the outset what principle of limitation will be
                called upon to give that vaulting largeness and longness a meaningful form? One will
                surely be needed.</p>
            <p>The book subtitled <italic>American Literature across Deep Time</italic> knows this,
                of course. And that, more than an improbable imperial nostalgia, is no doubt why it
                grants the high interest of the disciplinary construction (the reduction of
                complexity) called American literature even as it aptly critiques the parochialism
                of that construction on behalf of humanity (a less drastic reduction of complexity)
                at large. But lest we be naively surprised or inordinately disappointed by the many
                questionable ways human beings try to scale down the world to make it
                comprehensible, meaningful, and manageable to them, this needs to be made explicit
                and its consequences faced. As Nicholas Humphrey has recently argued, a sense of
                human self-worth begins in the illusory experience of ourselves as somehow more than
                matter, and facilitating that experience is, for him, the most profoundly adaptive
                function of consciousness. But that extension-from-matter is meaningless unless it
                becomes recursive, attached once again to the body or bodies from which it
                    emerged.15 Not just American literature
                but most all literature would seem to facilitate this recursive sequence of scaling
                up and scaling down. This is immediately evident in the institutions of genre,
                which, no matter how long-lived or sprawling they may be, build a modal specificity
                into the literary text at its ground. It is also visible in the work of literary
                institutions in the more ordinary sense, whose affordance of creativity and
                originality is always also an occasion for the humble practice of repetition and
                reiteration, of <italic>covering the same old ground</italic>. The unusual and
                (until recently) uniquely American institution of the graduate program in creative
                writing makes this scandalously clear. But it is most tellingly evident in those
                rare works of literature that set themselves the task of scaling our vision
                dramatically up or down or both, blasting through ordinary perception to the most
                surprising vistas we can imagine. That these works, upon inspection, fail to
                transcend their historical and medial conditions of possibility testifies to the
                limits of the human imagination, true, but those limits are also what allow us to
                know and feel our presence in the world as something in particular. Although the
                opposite is equally true, it's only in the failure of imagination that we find
                a reason to live.</p>

                        life and culture is explicitly seen as one threshold (obviously very
                        important to humans) in an ongoing process of complexification that begins
                        with the synthesis of chemical elements after the Big Bang, continuing with
                        the birth of stars, the accretion of planets, the appearance and evolution
                        of life, and so on. See also Cynthia Stokes Brown, <italic>Big History: From

                            Humanities</italic> (New York, 2008), pp. 89–170. In its efforts
                        to speak up for forms of human reproduction and interrelation other than
                        biological ones, <italic>Through Other Continents</italic> can be seen to
                        offer implicit resistance to literary Darwinism and evolutionary psychology,
                        which make the reproductive imperative paramount to understanding
                        literature. But whether or not it would have been worth confronting literary
                        Darwinism directly, the absence of any consideration of evolution in
                        Dimock's book is remarkable. One of the more important benefits of
                        taking the fact of deep time seriously is how it alters our sense of the
                        plausibility of the unintended appearance of highly complex biological
                        structures in natural history. Put simply, these “miracles” seem
                        much less miraculous when considered as the product of, say, eighty thousand
                        generations submitted to selective pressures rather than the three or
                        four—or even twenty, on a good day—that humans are ordinarily
                        capable of intuiting as meaningful. And yet, still more fascinatingly, in
                        the school of evolutionary and paleontological thought called cladistics, it
                        is precisely the astonishingly long length of deep time that makes all
                        evolutionary narratives seem “unscientific.” As Henry Gee puts
                        it: “The reason for this lies with the fact of the scale of geological
                        time that scientists are dealing with, which is so vast that it defies
                        narrative. Fossils, such as the fossils of creatures we hail as our
                        ancestors, constitute primary evidence for the history of life, but each
                        fossil is an infinitesimal dot, lost in a fathomless sea of time, whose
                        relationship with other fossils and organisms living in the present day is
                        obscure. Any story we tell against the compass of geological time that links
                        these fossils in sequences of cause and effect—or ancestry and
                        descent—is, therefore, only ours to make. We <italic>invent</italic>
                        these stories, after the fact, to justify the history of life according to
                        our own prejudices” (Henry Gee, <italic>In Search of Deep Time: Beyond
                            the Fossil Record to a New History of Life</italic> [Ithaca, N.Y.,
                        1999], p. 2). Cladistics replaces narrative evolutionary accounts with a
                        formal analysis of fractal branching patterns of relationships between the
                        characteristics of various species.</p>

                    <p>The same might be said of media theory. At first glance Zielinski's
                        media archaeology, founded on a notion of the “deep time of the
                        media,” would seem to ally itself with Dimock, except that in practice
                        it proceeds by making a series of cuts in the history of technology. Landing
                        in these historical moments, we recover some of the complexity and
                        once-upon-a-time potentiality lost in linear accounts of progress toward a
                        certain technical end, but we sacrifice diachronic continuity altogether.
                        Similarly, Kittlerian media theory likes to defend itself against the charge
                        of determinism, rightly confident that it can expose the fantasy of
                        indetermination from which these charges issue. Its real mistake, however,
                        is <italic>fetishism</italic>—the assumption that media alone
                        “determine our situation” (Kittler, <italic>Gramophone, Film,
                            Typewriter,</italic> p. xxxix). Dimock's multiscalar analytical
                        acrobatics can help us see how limited, finally, this perspective is. The
                        problem with media theory is less in asserting the dominance of technology
                        over our naïve dreams of personal agency than in inexcusably cheating
                        us of a view of the full range of our determinations, from the materiality
                        of geological and microbial evolution, near one end, to the intimate force
                        of nationalist and other ideologies toward the other.</p>

                    <p>Another way into the question of genre and nation is to look at the generic
                        forms of nationalism, as Patrick Colm Hogan does in his
                            <italic>Understanding Nationalism: Narrative, Cognitive Science, and
                            Identity</italic> (Columbus, Ohio, 2009). Grounding his analysis in
                        human cognitive structures understood as universals, Hogan perforce
                        “view[s] nationalism working over a much longer time scale” (p.
                        5) than is usually understood to be the case, seeing modern instantiations
                        thereof as larger versions of an in-group/out-group dynamic basic to all
                        organized social relations stretching back through history. Hogan divides
                        nationalist narratives into “heroic,” “sacrificial,”
                        and “romantic” tragicomic forms. The last, which often takes the
                        form of a “love story in which society … prevents two lovers
                        from uniting” (pp. 12, 13) seems most pertinent to Dimock, in that it
                        is the narrative form of nationalism most attuned to the necessity for the
                        synthesis of subnational into national forms: “As a result, the
                        romantic structure may operate, not only as a narrative of national
                        reconciliation, but as a narrative of internationalism. Put differently, it
                        may serve as a means of opposing national divisions just as it may serve as
                        a means of opposing subnational divisions. Indeed, the logic of the romantic
                        plot seems to push inevitably toward undermining categorical identifications
                        of any sort, including national identifications (and toward challenging
                        group hierarchies of any sort)” (p. 16). In Dimock's critical
                        text, we could say, the intimacy of writer and reader (no matter how
                        far-flung in space or time) becomes a romantic dyad modeling a transcendence
                        of national categories. Focused as it is on the in-group/out-group
                        distinction, Hogan's text does not explicitly address the question of
                        social scale in social identification, but one could simply point out that
                        what he calls models of national identity—the generic narratives or
                        even single metaphors that organize nationalist sentiment—are a means
                        of scaling down a large and complex social reality.</p>

            <p>The genre that has been most responsive to the hard fact of deep time has no doubt
                been the horror genre, and simply putting Edgar Allan Poe beside Emerson and Thoreau
                might already begin to alter the optimistic account that Dimock builds upon the
                foundations of nineteenth-century American literature.16 More corrective still, because more definitively postromantic, would
                be Poe's successor H. P. Lovecraft, whose stories were published in magazines
                like <italic>Weird Tales</italic> in the twenties and thirties and aspired to what
                Lovecraft in one of his letters called “an aesthetic crystallisation of that
                burning &amp; inextinguishable feeling of mixed wonder &amp; oppression which the
                sensitive imagination experiences upon scaling itself &amp; its restrictions against
                the vast … abyss of unthinkable galaxies &amp; unplumbed
                    dimensions.”17 In Lovecraft deep
                space and deep time alike are reasons to doubt the significance of humanity, whose
                ontological purchase on the universe it inhabits is vanishingly small. We can try to
                project our pathetic selves outward into time and space, but we must understand that
                “there are no values in all infinity—the least idea that there are is
                the supreme mockery of all. All the cosmos is a jest, and fit to be treated only as
                    jest.”18</p>
            <p>Partly in recognition of the philosophical seriousness of his deflationary enterprise
                but also in growing recognition of the importance of genre fiction to literary
                history, Lovecraft is now available in the Library of America series. And yet the
                debased status of the horror genre as it was originally constituted in the pulps was
                ironically more appropriate to his thematic ends, the <italic>pulpiness</italic> of
                their original material substrate figuring the rank, rotting mess into which the
                dignity of even the most acid-free human structures can be expected to collapse. We
                are familiar with the charge that genre fiction is subliterary owing to its
                “formulaic” quality, but the case of Lovecraft suggests another, equally
                telling way of looking at the problem of cultural status, where it appears rather as
                one of scale. True, one can point to several unambiguously canonical literary
                works—most famously <italic>Gulliver's Travels</italic> (1726) and
                    <italic>Alice in Wonderland</italic> (1865)—that test and indeed, in these
                cases, thematize the problem of scale in various ways, but their frequent placement
                in the category of children's literature shows where the difficulty with
                crediting genre fiction with high literary value will come to lie. When, having
                fallen down the rabbit hole, Alice changes size from too large, to too small, then
                back again, this could be taken to figure the developmental narrative of childhood
                as a nonlinear process of scalar adjustment to the adult world. But it also suggests
                how scalar instability might come to be tagged as juvenile in the pejorative
                sense.</p>
            <p>To see the world through the eyes of a child can be refreshing in some contexts, but
                from the eighteenth-century forward artistic seriousness in fictional narrative has
                been strongly associated with realism and realism, in turn, with a
                reasonable-seeming correspondence between representation and ordinary adult
                perceptual experience. Even when works of science fiction, fantasy, and horror are
                clearly intended for an adult readership, an air of adolescent irrelevance hovers
                about them all the same. Exemplary in this regard would be the case of Horace
                Walpole's <italic>Castle of Otranto;</italic> it begins, notoriously enough,
                with the crushing of Manfred's heir by a building-sized helmet suddenly fallen
                from the sky. The story is made less “childish” when Clara Reeve
                rewrites it as <italic>The Old English Baron</italic>, scaling that wonderful helmet
                right out of the picture on the grounds of its being ridiculously improbable.19 It is, of course, except that laughable
                largeness encodes the existential problem of scale as such. As the recognized
                initiator of the gothic genre—which genre is itself an important origin-point
                for the modern idea of genre fiction as ludicrously formulaic—Walpole's
                place in the canon has been at least marginally secure.20 Lovecraft's case, however similar to Walpole's in
                some intriguing ways, was different.21 With no
                real social position or higher degrees to speak of and forced to ply his
                “non-supernatural cosmic art” in the pulps, Lovecraft was fated until
                very recently to be perceived as lying utterly beyond the pale of artistic
                    seriousness.22</p>
            <p>In his own time Lovecraft was a sadly impoverished, embittered, and marginal cultural
                figure, and piecing through the relation of his philosophical nihilism to his
                intense racism and xenophobia has been the first order of business for his recent
                critics and admirers, including the novelists Michel Houellebecq and China
                    Miéville.23 One can do a lot, in
                turn, with Lovecraft's long-time hovering at the borders of Brown University,
                which to his lasting shame would not admit him as a student. Unable to amass the
                mathematics credits he needed to graduate from high school, he retreated to his
                family's shabby-genteel house in Providence, rarely leaving it for the next
                five years. It is easy to imagine those years of domestic darkness as a kind of
                anticollege, the biographical equivalent of antimatter. When he finally emerged and
                began to make contact with other struggling writers like himself, Lovecraft spoke
                ruefully of the observatory and other scientific attractions of the university:
                “Once I expected to utilise them as a regularly entered student, and some day
                perhaps control some of them as a faculty member. But having known them with this
                ‘inside’ attitude, I am today unwilling to visit them as a casual
                outsider and non-university barbarian and alien” (quoted in
                    <italic>HPL,</italic> p. 87). As the racial “degenerate” is to
                old-line Providence, so is he to scientific professionalism: an alien. It is perhaps
                no wonder, one could say, that the university appears again and again in his fiction
                both as a longed-for seat of intellectual authority and as a serene pastoral
                enclosure that must be blasted open to the horrible truths of natural history; no
                wonder if the professors who acquire these dangerous truths must either die or risk
                going mad. “The most merciful thing in the world,” says the narrator at
                the outset of “The Call of Cthulhu,” “is the inability of the
                human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in
                the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage
                    far.”24</p>
            <p>Excluded from spaces of literary institutional respectability, Lovecraft sought to
                visit the horrible truths of deep time upon the island of ignorance formed by the
                conventions of literary realism. His border transgression inverts, in advance, the
                optative transnationalism of recent literary criticism. In the original Cthulhu
                story, the mystery begins at home in Rhode Island, in an increasingly ethnically
                corrupted USA, with the discovery of some strange documents among the papers of a
                recently deceased professor of Semitic languages at Brown. But as it unfolds the
                investigation spreads uncontrollably, first to the swamps around New Orleans, then
                to Greenland and Paris and Haiti and the mountains of China, and finally to a
                strange outcropping in the open ocean. The destiny of this transnational expansion
                of horror is however not the totality of the <italic>human</italic> world but an
                absolute temporal beyond, a non-Euclidean underground city from which the monstrous
                Cthulhu is now emerging after eons of absence to reclaim the planet for himself:
                “Everyone listened, and everyone was listening still when It lumbered
                slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity
                through the black doorway … <italic>The Thing cannot be
                described</italic>—there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and
                immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic
                order” (“CC,” p. 213; emphasis added).</p>
            <p>But apparently this Thing <italic>can</italic> be described; or, rather, its
                indescribability becomes the occasion for a notorious verbosity on Lovecraft's
                part. This is one of the tics of Lovecraftian narrative—the laboriously
                descriptive disavowal of describability—and it betrays his paradoxical
                attempt, even as he locates it, to structure the vacuum of deep time with rhetoric.
                His looping streams of overheated verbiage are studded with deliberate anachronisms,
                technical scientific terms, and most interestingly with language of the Cyclopean
                beyond itself, which reaches its hearers in low-modernist “enigmatical
                sense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish” (“CC,” p. 181). But
                ironically, in peopling the cosmic abyss beyond the human with a verbal lushness of
                eldritch demons, Lovecraft's tales of cosmic horror are as consoling as they
                are disturbing. At least there's <italic>intentionality</italic> out there, a
                source of authority immeasurably greater than any of those that frustrate his
                literary ambitions. Lovecraft's verbosity points to the further limits of his
                otherwise capacious imagination evidenced in the romantic reassurance he took in
                something as small as Anglo-Saxon “racial superiority”; but, to be fair,
                it also points to the limits of the human imagination as such, where narrative
                understanding, at least, seems to need characters of some kind as its vehicles.</p>
            <p>Indeed, while stock in Lovecraft is currently soaring on the power and prescience of
                his theories of “non-supernatural cosmic art,” which seems to speak so
                directly to the concerns of contemporary object-oriented philosophy and speculative
                realism, I would claim that an equal part of his interest as a writer is in the
                troubling shape taken by his limitations. Those limitations are unflattering to him
                and to humanity and much the worse for the quality of his writing, which was not
                always high; but they do open up, at the level of daily social practice, to a
                compelling vision of a writerly existence—compelling because so
                extraordinarily grounded and collegial, so generous in the expense of personal time.
                What Lovecraft took in the realm of racial fantasy, that is, he partly gave back in
                the form of endless hours of help to fellow writers, first under the auspices of the
                long-forgotten Amateur Journalism movement, of which he became a central figure,
                then as one of a group of struggling young writers who coalesced around the idea of
                “weird” fiction, sharing work, sharing imaginative terrain, and freely
                helping each other toward publication in the pulps. As Lovecraft put it in his
                official statement of the ideals of the organization of which he was a long-time
                officer, the United Amateur Press Association, which facilitated the scripting,
                publication, and circulation of hundreds of homemade newspapers among its far-flung
                members: <disp-quote>
               <p>The United aims to assist those whom other forms of literary
                        influence cannot reach. The non-university man, the dwellers in different
                        places, the recluse, the invalid, the very young, the elderly; all these are
                        included within our scope. And beside our novices stand persons of mature
                        cultivation and experience, ready to assist for the sheer joy of assisting.
                        … It is an university, stripped of every artificiality and
                        conventionality and thrown open to all without distinction.
                            [<italic>HPL,</italic> p. 104]</p>
            </disp-quote> Working sideways from
                this journalistic endeavor into the literary community in which his literary efforts
                took shape, we are tempted to see the generic institution of the weird, too, as a
                kind of virtual college, a weird college. These social groups give the lie to
                Lovecraft's melodramatic claim that “there are no values in all
                infinity”; obviously there are. They are right here, writ small. His mistake
                was to think that the relative weakness and evanescence of the values shared by his
                community of literary underdogs meant that they were in fact worthless. This is only
                true insofar as one has already projected some source of authority into the larger
                darkness, as though an undifferentiated span of space could pass meaningful
                judgments. True, human concerns come off looking quite small in the cosmic scheme,
                but a different measurement protocol might find them all the more valuable for their
                scarcity. This, as we shall see, is one of the primary aesthetic insights of
                literary minimalism, which tacks against the kind of windy verbosity we find in
                Lovecraft, but only to run aground on its own mass of horror, the small horrors
                internal to literary institutions. It was a shame, certainly, that he could not see
                the links between the institutional outsiders with whom he identified and the racial
                outsiders he paranoiacally excoriated in his writing. But surely they are bonded,
                even if unbeknownst to him, in the monstrous visions of the Outside that populate
                his fiction. Products as much of self- as of other-loathing, those gelatinous green
                immensities contain multitudes.</p>

                        posthuman comedy from the first half of the twentieth century was Olaf
                        Stapledon, whose novel <italic>Last and First Men</italic> (1931) spans
                        millions and millions of years, following human evolution step by step far
                        beyond the human as we know it. And yet this magnificently imaginative
                        project also runs up against the limits of the novel genre as we know it,
                        presenting itself rather as a strangely double-voiced chronicle projected
                        back from the future into the consciousness of a contemporary writer for
                        whom it counts as fiction. This narrator is highly self-conscious in his
                        inability to include anything but discontinuous slivers of the evolutionary
                        multiplicity, the near-infinity of birth, death, and rebirth, which is its
                        subject. In Calvino's <italic>Cosmicomics,</italic> by contrast, the
                        representation of the inhumanly vast is accomplished by means of a brazenly
                        improbable personification that projects a coherent comedic consciousness,
                        that of an impossible character called Qfwfq, into the scene of the
                        emergence of time and space and planets and the like. W. J. T.
                        Mitchell's analysis of one of the stories deftly summarizes the
                        deceptively complex temporal structure of all of them: “The spatial
                        structure of Calvino's story is the layering of different levels of
                        temporality, the deliberate confusion of personal, individual time (measured
                        in days and hours), historical time (measured in larger, rather amorphous
                        periods of changing attitudes toward dinosaurs), and the ‘cosmic
                        time’ of natural history and paleontology, the 50 million years of the
                        narrator's dinosaur life. … All these levels are co-present, and
                        the narrative point of view functions like a kind of zoom lens that can
                        slide from a macroscopic overview of cosmic history to a microscopic tale of
                        two lovers” (W. J. T. Mitchell, <italic>The Last Dinosaur Book: The

                        While Stapledon tends to see the evolutionary fate of humanity as inherently
                        tragic, Calvino pictures the evolution of the universe as a kind of literary
                        cartoon, as though only an ostentatiously “childish”
                        representational form can aspire to represent it.</p>

            <title>3. Horrible Minimalism</title>
            <p>Now in its eighth edition dating back to 1982, Janet Burroway's <italic>Writing
                    Fiction: A Guide to Narrative Craft</italic> is as close as one might
                conveniently come to a normative center of contemporary creative writing
                instruction, and for it the <italic>human</italic> is at the center of everything.
                “The techniques of fiction,” claims the foreword by John Leggett of the
                University of Iowa's Writers' Workshop, are “simply the study of
                human behavior, the very essence of humanism, the be-all of a liberal
                    education.”25 Thus, as odd as the
                discipline of creative writing might seem in a hundred other ways, here it lays
                claim to a kind of liberal-institutional centrality in the merging of humane
                knowledge and literary craft. “Human character is in the foreground of all
                fiction,” confirms one of the book's two chapters on character
                development, <disp-quote>
               <p>however the humanity might be disguised.
                        Anthropomorphism may be a scientific sin, but it is a literary necessity.
                        Bugs Bunny isn't a rabbit, he's a plucky youth in ears. …
                        Henri Bergson, in his essay “On Laughter,” observes [that]
                        “the comic does not exist outside the pale of what is strictly human.
                        A landscape may be beautiful, charming or sublime, or insignificant and
                        ugly; it will never be laughable.” Bergson is right, but it is just as
                        true that only the human is tragic. We may describe a landscape as
                        “tragic” because nature has been devastated by industry, but the
                        tragedy lies in the cupidity of those who wrought the havoc, in the
                        dreariness, poverty, or disease of those who must live there. … By
                        all available evidence, the universe is indifferent to the destruction of
                        trees, property, peoples, and planets. Only people care.26</p>
            </disp-quote> Only people care, and people care
                about fiction because it is always about people, even if those people look like
                rabbits. And so, too, do the humanities make space within the institution of
                scientific knowledge for the <italic>valuing</italic> that occurs in the psychic
                theater of human experience and nowhere else.</p>
            <p>As unremarkably anthropocentric as its point about the necessary humanity of
                characters might seem, Burroway's textbook introduction carries a large surplus
                of philosophical interest, not least in how it manages to throw the obviousness of
                the human into an estranging conceptual relief. No one doubts that humanity in the
                form of character occupies the foreground of fictional narrative, and recent work in
                cognitive narratology confirms that the techniques of fiction are intimately tied to
                essential operations of the human mind. But here we are reminded that character is
                framed by something wholly other—an absolutely indifferent, starkly inhuman
                universe. Closer at hand, literature is set off against the literalism of science,
                whose pursuit of objective knowledge, even of intensely “human” things
                like human cognition, could be described as a kind of antianthropomorphism, an
                effort to know what is true about the universe behind and beyond the self-interested
                projections of the human point of view.27
                Burroway's textbook dispenses plenty of advice on how to write good stories by
                creating good characters and provides several examples of the works of “modern
                realism” in which it believes them most frequently to appear, but not before
                placing the institution of creative writing against a backdrop of proximate and
                ultimate—which is to say, institutional and
                    existential—othernesses.28</p>
            <p>To bring the wellsprings of the posthuman comedy into better view we'll want to
                stick with these othernesses a little longer, keeping them at the center of our
                concern, and we can do that by first returning to Bergson. Far from simply being a
                compelling analysis of what it means to find something funny, his book on laughter
                already points the way to the broader and frequently unfunny “comedy” of
                the human condition such as we find it in Dante's <italic>Divina
                    commedia</italic> or Honoré de Balzac's <italic>Le Comédie
                    humaine</italic>, where it is associated with various forms of ontological
                    <italic>lowliness</italic>.29 Indeed, as
                Graham Harman observes, “the often thin line separating the realms of comedy
                and horror can be seen in the now almost hackneyed role-reversals of
                    clowns.”30 It is true, as Burroway
                says, that for Bergson comedy can only be human, but it is also true that it arises
                only in the relation of humanity to something other. It is “something
                mechanical encrusted on something living.”31 We laugh when we see our fellow human beings fall prey to impersonal
                forces, when they lose the flexibility and adaptability that is the species'
                presumed birthright. Exemplary in this regard would be Charlie Chaplin in
                    <italic>Modern Times</italic> (dir. Chaplin, 1936), whose depiction of intimacy
                with machines Michael North sees as something more than a mere
                “encrustation”—rather, as a scandalous discovery of the
                machinelike nature of humanity itself. And what North therefore calls machine-age
                comedy is the first act of what I would call the posthuman comedy, the act in which
                we realize that we cannot be understood apart from our technological
                    prostheses.32 But lest we think that the
                cyborgic posthuman—the human spliced to its technology—exhausts the
                category of the posthuman, Bergson avers that “the more natural the
                explanation of the cause [of comedy to be], the more comic is the
                    effect.”33 Think here of the
                pratfall, taking the human down (always down) as though in a sudden gust of gravity.
                This suggests that while mechanism in the modern technological sense is one key to
                comedy, even more basic are the mechanisms of nature, the entire realm of natural
                processes that enclose, infiltrate, and humiliate human designs. The second act of
                the posthuman comedy is in this sense a turn (and continual return) to naturalism,
                one in which nature, far from being dominated by technology,
                    <italic>reclaims</italic> technology as a human <italic>secretion</italic>,
                something human beings under the right conditions naturally produce and use.34</p>
            <p>As we see, the textbook of creative writing can take us to the threshold of the room
                whose floor falls away into the abyss of unconscious physicality, but it refuses to
                step through the door. Instead, turning back to survey the room we always already
                occupy—call it the space of institutions—it sets about exploring the
                complex cognitive enclosure of the human point of view. This, it wagers, can be
                meaningfully tied to the complex but teachable techniques of narrative realism, the
                kind disseminated in the virtual space of the textbook and the real space of the
                creative writing classroom. No wonder, then, if the discipline of creative writing
                has had such a vexed relation to the “subliterary” genre forms that have
                most frequently and flagrantly attempted to cross the threshold into the inhuman and
                stay there awhile—science fiction and horror. Not only does genre fiction seem
                to violate the law of writing what you know from personal experience; not only does
                it bear its “formulaic” flatness on its grubby sleeve, catering to
                tastes unformed by the university, but its darkly dorky aesthetic unseriousness is
                an affront to the humanities—hell, an affront to humanity. Look at those
                characters, little more than the toys of allegory! If only genre fiction exhibited
                the chastity of quantitative representation one finds in a scientific paper; but,
                no, it insists on the comic personification of the absolutely other. It could in all
                seriousness be said that genre, as an occasion for the externally imposed repetition
                of a set of rules, is essentially comic in Bergson's sense, an encrustation
                upon the primordial flexibility of story. On this basis we could claim that comedy,
                and not tragedy, is the essential genre in that it includes
                “genericness” as one of its primary attributes.</p>
            <p>But while it mostly eschews the excesses of genre fiction as one finds them in
                Lovecraft, the discipline of creative writing is not without its own relation to the
                generic. Most simply, one could point to those many American program writers,
                ranging from John Hawkes to Ben Marcus and Shelley Jackson, whose avant-garde
                resistance to the tenets of modern realism has brought their work into (typically
                fractured and surrealized) relation to gothic and other genre forms. More
                interesting to me in this context, however, is the way that genre reinscribes itself
                even within the bounds of textbook realism. This it does in the form of a genre
                sometimes called the workshop short story, whose ubiquity, I have elsewhere argued,
                is owed equally to its inherent artistic possibilities and its pedagogical,
                professional, and existential convenience.35
                To tune into the discourse on the workshop story in literary journalism is to hear
                many of the insults usually directed against genre fiction repurposed as a
                condemnation of the all-too-many works now written with the program's guidance:
                repetitive, unoriginal, irrelevant, mere widgets spit out of the institutional
                machine. But whereas Lovecraftian genre fiction is faulted for trying to support too
                weighty a portion of the existential outside on the soft ground of pulp, the alleged
                sin of the workshop story is something like the opposite; it has been
                    <italic>domesticated</italic> in several overlapping senses, walled in by the
                dailyness of modern American consumer culture. Thematically and formally, it is
                simply <italic>too small</italic>.</p>
            <p>And yet it is worth remembering that the scale of the posthuman resides both on the
                small side of the human and on the large. This was the great lesson of the
                evolutionary biologist Lynn Margulis, who spent her illustrious career arguing that
                the real action in life takes place on a level of which humans are barely aware. For
                Margulis, human beings are simply not the “dominant species”36 they take themselves to be but rather the
                clown, the “planetary fool” dressed up to deny his deepest identity as
                “glorified sludge.”37 And
                it's true that for every gelatinous green immensity we could hope to see, there
                are untold legions of insects and mollusks, seething billions of microbes, trillions
                of atoms no less disturbing, from a certain perspective, to the dignity of humankind
                than old Cthulhu. In them, the problem of absolute largeness that preoccupies weird
                fiction is converted into the differently scaled problem of manyness. These
                disturbingly numerous small things are matched, in turn, to physical processes so
                fast, so brief in duration, as to be almost unthinkable.</p>
            <p>
            <italic>Our utter undermining by the small</italic>—this, it seems to me, is
                the dimension of posthumanity the genre of the workshop story is most fit to
                explore, though perhaps only rarely as literally as one finds it in Raymond
                Carver's very short story, “I Could See the Smallest Things,”
                included in his most notoriously minimalist collection, <italic>What We Talk about
                    When We Talk about Love</italic>. This was one of the key texts in an
                extraordinary reefflorescence of the American short story in the seventies and
                eighties, a phenomenon strongly associated with the rise of the creative writing
                program, on the one hand, and with the assertion of a deliberately ordinary,
                “lower-middle-class modernist” sensibility on the other.38 Carver's story tells the tale of a
                married woman woken by the sound of an open gate in her front yard. Staring out the
                window into the bright moonlight, she notices that she can “see
                everything,” even the “smallest things,” all of the details of her
                suburban surroundings.39 Putting on her robe
                and walking outdoors to close the gate, she notices her neighbor Sam Lawton rooting
                around in his rose bushes with a flashlight. He is poisoning some slugs.
                “‘They’re taking over,'” he says, showing her the
                “‘slimy things,’” killing one of them with a sprinkle of
                    powder.40 They talk a bit more, and then
                she returns to bed with her grotesquely snoring, bed-hogging husband Cliff, settling
                in … only to realize that she has forgotten to close the gate. The end.</p>
            <p>Things in this story could hardly be more ordinary, even with that Hawthornian
                moonlight cast over everything. It is a vignette of suburban American life, small,
                realistic, and—as represented by that gate—highly confined. Time in this
                story, such as it is, only extends backwards a few years, long enough to accumulate
                some deeply human regrets, but even that is made manifest mostly by implication from
                the narrative present, not as a fully articulated history. No need for that, the
                story seems to suggest. We are already familiar with histories like these. And yet
                that moonlight does seem significant, an appropriately modest intervention into
                debates about realism. The inclusion of moonlight seems to say, this is not romance,
                not in any of the senses of that term, and it is not even realism at the scale you
                have come to expect, but it is worth paying attention to all the same. Dispensing
                with complex modernist time schemes, minimalism manages time by dilating the
                present, inhabiting it, being there.41 It
                enables a kind of formal existentialism—an existentialism, unlike that of
                Sartre or Albert Camus, of deliberately limited philosophical means.42 That's why the title, “I Could See
                the Smallest Things,” seems at once utterly colloquial and too self-reflexive
                to ignore. It could be speaking to the possibilities of the minimalist short
                story—the workshop story—as promoted by the controversial writer,
                editor, and writing teacher Gordon Lish. He in fact came up with the title (the
                original had been “Want to See Something?”) while he was cutting
                Carver's original manuscript in half.</p>
            <p>Less is more, as they say; some of the stories in this collection were in fact
                damaged by Lish's brutal edits, but not (in my opinion) this one. Everything
                essential remains. Compressed into minimal discursive space, a mere slice of life,
                the historyless suburban American present of the story nonetheless gives access
                enough to the outer darkness to be quite unsettling. Who knows what horror might
                enter through that open gate? It certainly doesn't seem a promising avenue of
                escape into the mythically limitless American Dream, still less into the worldly
                pleasures of transnational circulation. Is this not the message carried by those
                eldritch little contradictions of form, those slimy minions of Cthulhu who feed on
                the rose bushes next door? Perhaps, in fact, although they can be hard to see with
                the naked eye, the spores of horror already have entered this woman's life.
                They entered on her wedding day, entered at the beginning of time.</p>

                    <p>These two versions of the posthuman can conveniently be associated with
                        Hayles, in the first case, and Cary Wolfe in the second. See Hayles,

                            Literature, and Informatics</italic> (Chicago, 1999), and Cary Wolfe,
                            <italic>What Is Posthumanism?</italic> (Minneapolis, 2010). The idea
                        that all technology is “biotechnology” is found in Lynn Margulis

                        project is taken up and transformed in the register of political theory in
                        the recent work of Jane Bennett, which would similarly “chasten [our]
                        fantasies of human mastery” with a fuller philosophical consideration
                        of the vibrancy of nonhuman matter conceived as an “agentic
                        swarm.” One of Bennett's formulations in particular points the
                        way to a kind of internalized Lovecraftian horror: “My flesh is
                        populated and constituted by different swarms of foreigners” (Jane
                        Bennett, <italic>Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things</italic>
                        [Durham, N.C., 2010], pp. 122, 32, 112). The swarm is obviously a compelling
                        object with which to ponder the problem of scale. Not only does its mobile
                        elasticity nicely illustrate the instability of form in time, but as a
                        visibly <italic>particulate unity</italic> it manages to be disturbing
                        simultaneously for its engulfing largeness and for the many, too many
                        smallnesses of which it is made.</p>
