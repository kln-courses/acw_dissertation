<plain_text><page sequence="1">Non-Western Sacred Sites: African Models LABELLE PRUSSIN National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution T he categories into which the Western world has traditionally organized African sacred sites and their related architectures reflect neither the nature of African thought, philosophy, or religion, nor the structure of African cultures. The discrete and separate cat- egories that characterize so much of Western architectural history, both sacred and secular, have been imposed on a cul- tural milieu that has no such divisions. In Africa the tradi- tional nature of religions and philosophies suggests a broader definition of the concept of "sacred site." Until recently, African studies in the English-speaking world tended to concentrate on either the sociological or the functional aspects of African culture, that is, on kinship systems and political organization or on material culture, rather than on cosmological and symbolic dimensions of African life. Myth, ritual, and cosmological symbolism were addressed and interpreted more as functional components in the social machinery than on their own terms as intel- lectual phenomena (Fortes and Dieterlen). In contrast, the French Africanists, notably Marcel Griaule and Jean-Paul Lebeuf, drawing on the methodology of structural anthro- pology set forth by Levi-Strauss, focused on the symbolic- philosophic order of African culture to elucidate cosmological systems and implicit philosophies. While African religious systems form coherent and autonomous spheres of thought and action of great diver- sity, they share three major, fundamental themes: archetypal symbols, ritual, and community (Mbiti, Ray). Archetypal symbols consist of the sacred images, whether they be gods, ancestors, sacred actions, or things, that make up the tradi- tional universe. Every African ritual is a salvation event in which human experience is re-created and renewed in the all-important ritual Present. Religious participation starts before birth and continues after death. Life unfolds as a reli- gious drama. Every sacrifice reinforces the group's solidar- ity; every rite of passage reforges and renews the corporate life. These three themes, which are simultaneous and mutu- ally related, invest the system with a continuity that persists despite the absence of a written record or a "permanent" archaeological system of sacred sites-since buildings are frequently rebuilt and relocated. Scholars in African archi- tecture, few in number, have tended to draw on anthropo- logical models and sought to explain sacred space and its history in reference to African cosmology, ritual, and the sense of continuity. To its users and creators, the language of African archi- tecture is symbolic and meaningful, voiced through a com- plex, expressive, and multivalent vocabulary. In Africa, all aspects of life are permeated by a reality in which meaning and creative forms function as a visual and aesthetic inter- face. Because the same aesthetic permeates all the arts in this African reality, architecture and its sacred sites constitute part of a greater unity: there is a continuum from one to the other. The major differences between a large, sun-dried earthen granary and a small fireclay pot hidden within it- both equally sacred, both similarly shaped-pertain to mag-</page><page sequence="2">..........-- ?:--:- :- ::: - ---:-:'- ---i--:- ..........-----:::-? -:- ?i.:::"--:-i--;i l ?? ??~ Figure 1 An early photograph (c. 1925) of the altars to the male and female powers of the divinity at Dissankoy, Ivory Coast.

The related functions and meanings that rituals unfold clothe both the built form and its artifactual counterpart in the same sacramental quality. The Earth as the source of all things, of humanity itself, is in many ways a universal concept. Basic to pagan classi- cal, Judeo-Christian, and Islamic traditions, it was equally primordial in the traditional belief systems of many seden- tary African peoples. This concept of the Earth as a primary source of life continues to permeate human existence, par- ticularly in rural Africa. African cosmologies and mytholo- gies express creation in terms of the Earth. Thus, Dogon mythology relates how the god Amma took a lump of clay, squeezed it in his hand, and flung it from him to create the Earth. Then the union of the Earth-wife with the god Amma produced the set of Dogon twins from which the Dogon people in Mali evolved. Much of this last millennium of African history is over- laid with an Islamic presence. With the introduction of Islam into sub-Saharan Africa, the belief that permeates African cos- mology, that ancestors reside in the Earth, was not abandoned. Rather, it found a commonality with Islam's own explanation for genesis. Islamic Malikite building prescriptions, which set forth the need to build mosques solidly of earth, were easily integrated into a cultural milieu where indigenous earthen sanctuaries and shrines, earthen granaries and funerary mark- ers were already an architectural expression of the spiritual subterranean occupancy of African ancestry. Since the Earth itself is a viable force, structures built of earth are sacred in every sense of the word. Architectural form and natural habitat are inseparable from and integral to each other; built and natural environments constitute a _: ii iii iiii -ii-iil iiiiii i iii i i i i_ i! i--i i l~ ?i i.i:,_!!i!!i ll i !!- ! ! i iiiiiii ! il iii iii!iiiiiii i i~!iii ii i i i iil i - i .: iiii!! !i. i iiii :ii -iii ..........._iii: _:iii -:: ;iii iiii ii ,iiiiiiiiiiii-iI',I?'''IIIII ' Figure 2 Earthen pillars at the entrance to a Tallensi compound, northern Ghana, 1965. Photograph by author single entity. Like living creatures, built forms are often dif- ficult to distinguish from the earth out of which they are molded. The ancestors, beneficent deities that must be evoked for propitious results or placated to avert detrimen- tal dangers, are the focus of all rituals that accompany any kind of intervention with the Earth. The ubiquitous ances- tral graves that rise from the Earth's surface mark the ances- tral residence sites (Figure 1). These ancestral grave markers are closely related to another metaphor on the savanna landscape, the elongated, conical earthen pillars that, by their presence at the bound- aries of villages and at the entrances to housing compounds or deep within their inner recesses, solicit the help of the ancestors in achieving well-being. Shrines shaped out of the Earth itself, guarding the entrances to villages and houses, or occupying the deepest hidden recesses of a building itself, are also the means of communicating with the ancestors. Often integral with earthen walls of the ancestral sanctuar- ies themselves, their extended, tapered form has evolved into an architectural style sacred to both traditional as well as Islamic belief and Christian belief (Figure 2). Sacred symbolic forms and the sites associated with them accrue additional meaning as the sacrifices and liba- NON-WESTERN SACRED SITES 425</page><page sequence="3">~#2e 7;Is Figure 3 The village mosque at Larabanga, northern Ghana, 1965. Photograph by author tions made to them are periodically repeated. Such rituals often involve the act of rendering the surface of the form with a wash of kaolin. Like plaster over adobe, the fine clay protects and preserves the earthen form; in equal measure, it enhances the inviolable quality of the sacred symbol because white is the color of sacredness in many African societies (it is also the preferred color for costume associated with ritual). In addition, the sacred ritual entails a hands- on renewal process, which in itself imbues and enhances the architectural form with additional sacred quality, much as the processional in any church interior does. The traditional integration of ancestral graves located at the entrances to the households of chiefs and household elders, with applied kaolin, mosaic tiles, and broken porce- lain, persisted even after the introduction of Christianity, Judaism, and/or Islam. To be sure, centuries of Islamic pres- ence in the midst of traditional savanna cultures effected changes both imperceptible and radical, but for the most part, the preexisting sacred ancestral imageries were inte- grated with the architectural forms called forth by the new religious tenets; they continued to function as a metaphor for the ancestral presence (Prussin, 1986). The tombs of the historic ancestors who figured so prominently in the course of African political and religious life, as well as the sacred shrines that house the powerful agencies of holy men, are designated and recognized by these same earthen-pillar-like fagades. And in like manner, the pagan ancestors that the earthen pillars symbolized have been transformed into a new metaphor for piety, wisdom, and literacy in the Islamic context of the mosque, where clustered ranks of engaged earthen buttresses terminate in identical pottery-capped, kaolin-covered conical pillars (Figure 3). New earthen building technologies were gradually introduced with the centuries-long establishment of Euro- pean colonial centers, but not only did the underlying gestalt remain, it was extended and expanded to become the essence of the architectural style of all sacred places in West Africa. Translated into what has come to be known popu- larly as the "Sudanese style" in West Africa, the iconogra- phy perpetuates a visual heritage whose meanings are drawn from the traditional African mold (Figures 4, 5). The gender counterpart to the ancestral earthen pillar (evocative of the male gender) is the earthen granary. As the source of life's sustenance, the Earth finds quintessential sacred expression in the architectonic perfection and diver- sity of the earthen granaries that dot the landscape. As a storage container, the granary is not only a metaphor for physical well-being but a receptacle for the spiritual source of life, a symbol for the continuity of life and the future, a receptacle for the grain that will guarantee life's sustenance from one harvest to the next. The softly rounded earthen mounds from which millet and yam seedlings sprout are the 426 JSAH / 58:3, SEPTEMBER, 1999</page><page sequence="4">=: ift , 1W : 1, Figure 4 The Palais des Colonies at the Exposition Uni- verselle in Paris, 1900. From Champier, Chefs d'Oeuvre de I'Exposition Universelle, vol. 5 ([Paris], 1902). Rephotographed by Roger Viollet, Paris Beginning. A metaphor for prosperity and fertility, the form of these extended dome-shaped mounds evokes a gender association. It is the complement of the male ancestors who reside in the past (Figure 6). These huge earthen jars are not always made by women or by women potters, but their form uniquely embodies the ultimate metaphor associated with women and fertility-an egg-in contrast to the ancestral male pil- lars. A full granary is a pregnant granary. And to be sure, a clay pot containing the seed for the next year's planting is often sealed and buried deep within its womb-like interior (Lebeuf). The granary's form, its taut, close-to-bursting walls recalling the tight skin of a pregnant woman close to term, is only one of its feminine attributes (Figure 7). Other clearly evident attributes of womanhood and fertility (the essence of being female) that are painted, sculpted, or incised on the granaries bear a close resemblance to the pat- terns applied to adjacent house wall surfaces by the female occupants of the housing compound. Pragmatically, the size of a granary can be increased by the introduction of internal wall reinforcement and external tension rings, but the larger granary also implies more children: by extension, size is a symbol of extended well-being. Having many children ensures not only con- tinued prosperity but posterity and personal immortality as well.

Photograph by author African elder asks, "If I have no children, who will remem- ber me when I die?" In the compounds of northern Benin, the granaries are built on an upper house level. Where there is one principal granary, it is located precisely in the center of the circular compound, supported by an ancestral pillar on the lower level and visible only to the house occupants (Figure 8). The pillar and the granary it supports constitute the central core, the fulcrum, of the sacred architectural configuration. The Western observer has often likened these compounds to castles or fortification systems, but one has only to recall Brancusi's sculpture The Beginning of the World to recognize in these huge clay eggs the symbolic meaning with which the participant-observer endows them. The anthropomorphic nature of African ontology has long been acknowledged by scholars of African art history who focused on wooden masking traditions in various ritual contexts. In like manner, all things fashioned from the Earth are humanized. Because the Earth is the preeminent build- ing resource for both ancestral pillars and granaries, human imagery is conceptualized and expressed in a spectrum that extends from pottery to architecture. The underlying rationale that emerges from creativity in clay is applicable to all those who work with and shape the earth. In his field- recorded accounts of Dogon mythology, Griaule cited the venerable elder Ogotmeli: ". . . in molding the clay, the woman is imitating the work of God when He modeled the earth into the first couple" (89). When the Songhay masons (bari) of Djenn6 on the Upper Niger Delta in Mali build the acroteria that extend above the house faqades, the judg- ment of architectural quality is conveyed by analogy with men: "They should rise above the roof line straight and tall, ....... ....... ?:T 1-4 Figure 7 Granaries in northern Ghana, located in the hidden interior of a Lobi compound.

In their various parts and rooms, housing and village settlements represent the image of the mythological ances- tors held sacred in formal association with the model of the human body in their organization of architectural space. True, this underlying anthropomorphism recalls a basic Renaissance principle espoused by Michelangelo, who also made the analogy between architectural members and the members of man: those who do not know the human body cannot be good architects. According to Suzanne Blier, a similar symbolic system exists among Batammaliba people of northern Benin, where components of the houses are associated with the anatomy of its occupants. Among the Dogon, the entire compound is a representation of a woman 428 JSAH / 58:3, SEPTEMBER, 1999</page><page sequence="6">...........~ i!! i : :: ; ...

Courtesy La Documenta- tion Frangaise, Paris lying down in the act of procreation, and the concept extends beyond architectural components: in the layout of a village, the village head is represented by the smithy and the men's meetinghouse (iron itself is sacred), his chest by the family lineage houses, his hands by the women's menstrual houses, and his feet by the village altars (Griaule, 95). Perhaps the most striking extension of the sacred anthro- pomorphic attributes of a family residence can be found in a description of urban housing in Timbuktu, where the house is said to be a representation of the primordial Blacksmith and his wife, who descended from the Sky (Paques). In many of the West African societies documented in recent art-histori- cal field research, the wives of the blacksmiths are often pot- ters. The relationship between potters and blacksmiths is established by fire. It is perhaps no coincidence that the Dogon say that pottery was born in the smithy, where fire is also the catalyst for material transformation. Iron itself is considered sacred. Tools used in agricul- ture and warfare-both critical to survival-are made of iron. Iron staffs, even iron engine blocks, often planted adjacent to a central tree, mark the center of villages, and ritual drums are hung from them. As specialized and skilled artisans, blacksmiths are considered to possess magical pow- ers that allow them to communicate with the invisible genies, the djinn, who were also created of essential fire (Koran, Surah 15:27). They are equally charged with main- taining the shrines, the consecrated objects to which super- natural powers are attributed, and the structures in which they are housed.

Figure 10 Furnace of the blacksmiths southeast of Ouahigouya, Burkina Faso, 1942. Courtesy IFAN, Dakar smiths built their own earthen smelters (Figure 10). The smelting process, a highly regarded, sophisticated technol- ogy, was enveloped in a highly secret, highly charged set of operations, and the furnaces themselves were equally charged with sacred meaning. To function successfully, the smelters required a number of long ceramic air tubes that allowed incoming air to be heated as it was guided down into the heart of the furnace. In Guinea, the term used by the sedentary Peul blacksmiths for these tubes is malaka, a word used to designate the mythologically important angels (of both Muslim and Judaic origin). In the Ader region of Niger, the same term used in reference to the smelter is applied to the granaries, which are constructed in a similar truncated conical form. The cosmic tree in African sacred thought evokes the ultimate challenge to the laws of gravity and the aspirations of humankind. This is voiced in Ibsen's play The Master Builder, where the vertical tower becomes a symbol of vic- tory-and defeat. The concept of verticality, however, is the very antithesis of earthen works, where compression, in contrast to the tensile properties of wood, reflects a down- ward force.

Photograph by author with wood (tension) in order to achieve height toward the sky above is most poignantly reflected in the use of toron, the timber elements that project from the sides of many major religious and civic buildings, from mosques and their minarets as well as from palaces. The mosque at Bobo Dioulasso in Burkina Faso and the minaret of the mosque at Agades, Niger, the tallest traditional religious structures in West Africa, depend for their height on the combined use of earth and timber (Figures 11,12). Working together structurally, they transform the ancestral earthen pillar into a tapering, four-sided prism that rises 90 feet and thirteen levels above the ground, valiantly defying the laws of grav- ity. Embedded in the earth, these wooden structural mem- bers, which serve equally as scaffolding for the annual ritual resurfacing of the mosque, are, more importantly, a symbol of ancestral wisdom and proliferation. In Mali, the toro is used in association with initiation into the Bamana komo societies, which deal with the acquisition of sacred human knowledge. Specifically, the term alludes to the Bamana funerary custom of burying a branch of the fig tree with the dead, in order to guarantee rebirth. This particular sacred attribute of the fig tree suggests an analogy with the Tree of Life, the Cosmic Tree, and axis mundi, familiar to the Western world in its various cos- mologies but equally at the core of African religious thought, as evidenced by the towering singular trees that mark both sacred places and village centers alike. In her dis- cussion of Jewish iconography, Ameisenowa (1938-1939) pointed out the symbolism of the Tree of Life (which she equated to the Tree of Truth and Tree of Knowledge) in Hebrew eschatology. In the Islamic Sufi tradition, Tuba, the celestial lote-tree that grows in Paradise, has long been used metaphorically. In a remarkable study of the holy city of Touba in Senegal, Eric Ross (1996) has shown how the Tree of Life, or Tree of Paradise, appears to be firmly rooted in African religious thought as an eschatological and cosmo- logical symbol. According to Touba's founding myth, the city was founded beneath a great tree where Ahmadou Bamba, the city's founder, had a vision, and while this great tree no longer exists, a single minaret marks the center of the city, like an axis mundi. My own research into African nomadic sites, spaces, and architectures has often evoked skepticism from West- ern scholars, who have challenged this inclusion into the traditional Western-defined architectural domain. Their sacred quality was even more vehemently questioned. Face- tiously, I have often replied by citing the Tabernacle. Indeed, the organization of sacred space in an African tent or on its site is not unlike the organization of space within the Tabernacle, which the descriptive passages in the Book of Exodus clearly describe and which Le Corbusier so adeptly converted into his own model of "a primitive tem- 430 JSAH / 58:3, SEPTEMBER, 1999</page><page sequence="8">---- :;:: i ..-. . :i-::;:::::,::_~:i ;-- .-.---- i::-_:iii-:- :::::--~:-:'-::: .:-_ .- . : .. : .; -.- :::--~---- -:-::::-_-:_--:i:: :: :;:: I--~---:l-:l--i-l~-~-:~-:-l::i _:- _:_:--:---:- ; - : . : ::: : - ii~i----:i ~ i:i :--i-__-- :i~i. i:iii-i;i-iij--:i 'iiii - ~c::-iii .:-:-- i --- i :I --~:----~:~?-1-_- --:: ----_i:B-~ ;--?I :::_-il-~i_~l_--:i-_--s-~ il:-~is~l;: ; ~se:~.l;,:.i-$-r-_-__~___~-__~1:I-~--_t i~;:_-:-;_:;-__:-_:;: ::::::::: ii:i~~giPPi-ikii?iiiiiii i~iiii-iiii~i,:~i:i~ii~iiaiiE:-:i-i:i-~ - --i-_-xi-i:i-i-: -:: :?'- i -:: .: -:::;:: _~-;_:::i:-;-_-:;_ -_-__::r_:~_---;:::- : . :----_-----:::i-----?---.::-?-. .:::-: ... ..: q-_,;~-:--_-_~___:?__-_-_-_-_ : :- : : : - : s-a-ii-i~i-iti~~i~ii~i~x~l-iii -iB i::iiii'irii?_iii- i i):ii'-:i:ii: Bi?Liri~?- __ _ii-_ i: -: ... i: i-: -: - -i:--'-:::ii:ii_ -~ji---i:i:-:::---i-;i---i--- - --:::::::- -::: ::::il::-`:::-'il: :i--:_i: ii~ii--:~i::----:-ii _ ::':::.: :---::::: ?il-------::~:i-_:-_-:_:--~-_---_--:_--: ;:-:: : __::i:-:_::::: --:::::; --i-:---::-:-:i-::-;:::::?iii--iiii-i-- : : ::_: : ::- : ::--:-::----:i :-ii?-~-l-?ii~ii-:-:--:-~--------:----:- :--:-:-- :--:- i- ::::: : i:-: -i - i:_:i-: -:.: --.-.

Figure 12 The Great Mosque at Agades, Niger, built 1830, as photographed 1952. Courtesy La Documentation Frangaise, Paris pie" (Prussin, 1995, figure 1.1). Equally relevant and per- haps more poignant to this consideration of sacred nomadic space is the funerary tent for an Egyptian princess-priestess excavated at Deir el-Bahri, assumed to date from the second millennium B.C. In the nomadic context, sacred sites are defined even more vividly by behavior and movement in space rather than by fixed building forms and boundaries. It is the ritual artifact, associated with birth, marriage, and death, that endows the site with a sacred quality. In contrast to sedentary cultures whose continuity depends upon the harvest reaped from the earth, among the African nomads (as among nomads elsewhere), the organi- zation of nomadic space almost invariably emanates from a concentration on inner space identified with its woman cre- ator, a focus that found expression millennia ago in the rock paintings at Tassili in the southern Algerian Sahara. The interior space of the moving domicile, geometrically orga- nized into quadrants, is the epicenter of sacred space. The marriage ritual and the hidden space within which the mar- riage is consummated, clothed in sacred expressiveness, rei- fies architectural creativity, since the creation of a new nomadic domicile comes into being with the marriage rit- ual itself. The backdrop of the tent interior is the equivalent of an altar (Prussin, 1995). Among the Gabra in northern Kenya, this altar, composed of a cluster of egg-shaped milk containers hung on the structurally reinforced "back" wall of the tent interior, vividly evokes the sacred synonymity between fertility and life's continuity (Figure 13). Highly decorated ostrich eggs hung from the four quadrants of the interior convey an even more explicit sacred message. The counterparts to the sacred interior space are the itinerant sites of transition feasts in which the rituals of male generation-sets within a nomadic phratry are staged. Special enclosures are built to protect the sacred symbols (drums, fire sticks, and horns) that accompany the performance of solemn religious ceremonies. These enclosures, aligned along a north-south axis, reflect the two moieties that com- prise the phratry (Figure 14). The parallel processionals enacted in and around these cardinal axes bring to mind both the Christian ritual reflected in the Stations of the Cross as well as the processional around the Kaaba per- formed by devout Muslims in the ecstasy that culminates their pilgrimage to Mecca. What emerges from this brief overview of African sacred sites should be obvious: sacredness permeates all African sites, natural or built, inhabited or long aban- doned, stationary or transitory, in a multitude of ways. At the same time, African history never existed in isolation from the world at large, and various parts of the continent were linked over time by complex routes along which scholars, traders, artisans, and proselytizers as well as NON-WESTERN SACRED SITES 431</page><page sequence="9">HK A ]N,1l .. .. .....
