<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? By R. G. Collins "Life," observed Oscar Wilde, who as wit, sentimentalist, cynic, pro fligate, aesthete, culture hero, genius and decadent, knew life in as many forms as any man, "is much too important to talk about seriously." Unim portant seriousness is pompousness or empty pedantry; important non-seri ousness, on the other hand, is that peculiar profundity of humor that has intrigued us from the beginning. While Aristotle left no analysis of comedy, there are few serious thinkers since his time who have not been tempted towards it. As Carlyle, loosely quoting Shaftsbury, noted: " 'Twas the saying of an ancient sage . . . that humor was the only test of gravity, and gravity, of humour. For a subject that would not bear raillery was suspicious; and a jest that would not bear a serious examination was certainly false wit" ( Voltaire, 1827).</page><page sequence="2">2 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? Two considerations, then. The first: what is humor—or, at least, what are its characteristics? Can we, in one casserole, hash together mockery, ridicule, and vicious satire with whatever it is that Jean Paul Richter meant when he declared: "True humour springs not more from the head than from the heart; it is not contempt, its essence is love; it issues not in laughter, but in still smiles, which lie far deeper" (Edinburgh Review, 1827). And how does one reconcile the judgement of Mark Twain, speaking in the real voice of Samuel Langhorne Clemens: "The secret source of humor is not joy but sorrow; there is no humor in heaven," with the judicious view of that representative Victorian gentleman-author, Richard Monckton Milnes (Lord Houghton) as he says: "The sense of humour is the just balance of all the faculties of man. . 71 The second question: Was the humor of the nineteenth century, however enduring in nature, distinct in the forms of its occurrence? What was it like? From our own lofty perch atop the crag of Time, the Victorian World seems to have been a genial land. But, obviously ... a fool's paradise? Can we understand, appreciate, even learn anything from it? I One of the popular prejudices against advancing age is that we tend to become more irascible. There is at least an argument to be made for the view that as this old earth grows mossier, it becomes temperamentally more crusty as well. We do not see ourselves as happy, as blessed men. If the eighteenth century valued sensibility and wit, and the nineteenth century savored sentiment and wit, we seem to relish despair and wit. The hypo chondriacs of history, our generation finds its happiness in being unhappy. Perhaps. Perhaps, too, in all of us growls that old Tory who says that you can't give the literary franchise to the whole community without ex pecting a readjusting jolt in taste, which is to say belief, which is to say philosophy. As we grow more democratic, perversely we become less tolerant —of many of the ingredients of the comic, among other things—for 1 Apropos of Twain's remark: There are some who have said that there is no joy in heaven, either, since Lucifer, the Morton of that celestial Merry-Mount, was deported. Milnes, on the other hand, belonged to that breed of amiable conservatives who take the long view of life, though frequently by glancing back over their shoulders. As a patent generalization it can be said that men looking at the present, and to a considerable extent, at the future, are pessimistic; men looking back at the past that they have col lectively survived see it tinted with a rose hue, as a time of instinctive good humor. Consider the last stanza of Milnes' much-anthologized "The Men of Old." Man now his Virtue's diadem Puts on and proudly wears: Great thoughts, great feelings came to them [The Men of Old] Like instincts unawares. Blending their souls' sublimest needs With tasks of every day, They went about their gravest deeds As noble boys at play. Which is not so different, at that, from the sun-lit Life on the Mississippi, though vastly different from The Mysterious Stranger or even Pudd'nhead Wilson.</page><page sequence="3">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 3 equality banishes all forms of superiority, of station, of learning, of tra ditional wit, which is the mind vaulting over simple fact. As a generation, we are amusing but not very amused, funny but not very humorous. Mockery and satire, the leer and the jeer and the sneer, are the public manners of the electronic stage of today, while genial humor and gentle fun seem simple minded to the late twentieth century, which takes even its humor over seriously and views the past with an intense obtuseness through which a warmer wit cannot penetrate. However, echoing distinctly down the corri dors of the preceding century is a laughter that puzzles us, a sense of life that seems simultaneously made up of delight, enthusiasm, and self-awareness (though not self-consciousness), that after the fact somehow appears irre sponsible, given all that we now know about the personal unhappiness of a DeQuincey, a Dickens, a Thackeray, or a Wilkie Collins (reminding us of that ironic paradox, perhaps: that it's more interesting to read about great men than to be one). Debtors' prisons, industrial slavery of children, window taxes, Peterloo massacres, laws that imprisoned the spirit—all of the social brutality of a world not yet grown a public conscience—how could they have laughed so often, so richly, so variously, while Eliza was fleeing across the iceflows? Well, the tragedies of men live after them; their humor is oft interred with their bones. We have a formal relationship with all preceding generations.2 Morally superior though we may assume ourselves to be, it is not a very secure form of superiority, and we have since Homer believed that we must converse with the Dead to discover the true path. But then—it was the Greeks, or at least the Athenians, who started the rumor that owlishness was wisdom. There is no evidence that the Victorians believed it. History probably is more a process of editing the past to accord with our sense of things than it is an understanding of the past on its own terms, for we cannot get outside our own subsequent consciousness of it. We perceive their unhappiness in ways that they never did—just as we always know the right and obvious course for all other men to take in dealing with their problems, though our own are always more complicated. Actually, we know nothing more about the human condition than our great-grandfathers did; we know only more facts about the physical self, more details of chemistry, biology, physics. Indeed, as a society if not as individuals, we may know less, for we have insulated ourselves with increasing success from the funda mental truths of the human condition. With that amazing capacity that thinking creatures have for making themselves comfortable even when un happy, we have through a skillful combination of youth-worship and age brutalization (that is, in fact, a kind of social euthanasia) denied the later part of life as real experience, the recognition that fate includes dis-ease and age, loss and death. And if we cannot perceive our relationship with age, how can we claim one with the Ages? It is remarkable, then, that our grandfathers, who lived with these actual fundamental experiences on the doorstep—and certainly in the bedroom -As Marilyn Gaull ("Romantic Humor: The Horse of Knowledge and the learned Pig") points out, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, there was a fondness for unhappiness, too. We can assume that the same old Tory was there muttering the same new old things.</page><page sequence="4">4 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? (where slept Sex as only one of the three sisters, the other two sharing the bed being Birth and Death)—seem to have had a greater sense of humor. In our solemn way, and in the name of a rigorous social morality, we today castigate those who preceded us for the cruelty of their nursery tales (The Three Little Pigs, fricasseeing the Wolf in a tub of boiling water), while in the name of abstract humanity, we as a generation send letter bombs, condone tribal genocide as an acceptable act of majority democracy, and stockpile huge canisters of death, the sole use of which could only be to eliminate life from the earth.3 Certainly the acceptance of violence as a corrective for a "guilty" society is a greater evil than is an exemplary tale condemning gratuitous assault, through the device of anthropomorphic beasts. Humor, of course, allows us our lessons without a personal agony, and few children's tales, or fairy tales of any kind, omit it as a basic characteristic. This humorous handle to grasp a searing idea is very im portant, and we shall return to it, shortly. While we cannot have their personal understanding, we can assimilate the experience of past men. However, the reverse is not true; the past—or the present—cannot really conceive the future in any serious sense because that would be to deny the present self-value, as a transitory thing. Therefore, we reject most new ideas by instinct, except as play. From infancy on, almost all new ideas come to us as play in one form or another—though this is not true of new techniques, new facts. For the moment, I shall use the word comedy interchangeably with humor and say that comedy functions effectively as a control over, though not as an element that suppresses, our emotional responses. That is, what we would otherwise have to condemn or reject, we allow ourselves tacitly to admit through comedy. Nonetheless, taken in the common sense, comedy as a categorical term will not suffice for our purposes. More often than not, "Comedy"—in a tragedy-comedy antithesis—is regarded as the general category, with humor a verbal element therein. This organization of idea serves well enough for arbitrary discussion of technique, but it works nowhere near so well in analyzing concepts. In fact, even when discussing technique, we frequently move around capriciously in our use of the words comedy and humor. With out utterly rejecting those advantages of inconsistency, I shall choose here to make humor the general category. Under that category, I shall for purposes of the present discussion use two major divisions, columns, faces, hemi spheres—call them what you will. The first is, in a reversal of the historical phrase, a humor of comedies, characterized by a direct wit in most cases. It includes such sub-genres as irony and parody. The second, less obvious in name, is a humor of sentiment, the artistic investing of experience with a warmth that conveys positive appreciation. It seems to have at least three distinct faces: (1) it touches our sympathies, as in a Dickensian death scene; or (2) gives us a sense of 3The Woodchopper in "Little Red Riding Hood," or Gretel's baking of the Witch to save Hansel are certainly not celebrations of violence but, rather, statements established over long centuries of human refinement: that the violent die violently and that one cannot brutalize other people without a serious consequence. It is true that the Wood chopper kills the Wolf. But—that's not what the story is about.</page><page sequence="5">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 5 delight in experience, as in a fairy tale; or (3) animates us with that un defined joy of simple excitement, sometimes in the most improbable of exaggerated adventures. The last grouping, the humor of excitement, func tions by the generating of high spirits, and so indirectly, it would appear, arrives at an effect similar to the preceding sub-genre, that of simple and immediate delight.4 What we are in, with humor, is a circus of words. Humor is words at play. Ideas, entertaining themselves with clever tricks and tropes. Perhaps, at that, all speculative thought is the mind entertaining itself, through images testing relationships as a means of self-gratification; as contrasted with the mind at labor (the mind as student-trainee), when it learns what others have already thought out and prepared in systems for it. The Imagination thus is the ringmaster trying out ideas inside that capacious cranial prop room of possibility, where it does not have to agree to prior definitions or external need. At its best, it is a time when the speculative mind can take full advantage of the astonishingly flexible unreality of words, but where meaning may anywhere exist. Imagination is the intellect as artist creating, emotionally penetrating the inner quality of an idea but simultaneously able to withhold itself to see the idea with the judiciousness inherent in a smile. What it loses in passion, it gains in emotional complexity. Humor thus is a protective mode, among other things, underneath which we can accept truth that we would otherwise spit out. For instance, as is true of the exemplary fairy tale, all science fiction can be thought of as essentially humor, in that it has an element of playing with logic in it. Humor as control device certainly exists in modern "black comedy," absurd drama, and contemporary fiction by the "fabulists" such as Pyncheon, Barthelme, and Vonnegut. (There is a similar basis in the recent technique of seizing upon historical figures and using them as objective correlatives, as fictional characters, in such novels as Ragtime, The Seven Per Cent Solution, The West End Horror, and earlier, and to better effect. The French Lieu tenant's Woman). Fables are play, with logical possibilities as the toys used. One of the main girders on which comedy is hung is the absurdity of logic, the upsetting of form and the formal. Carried one more step, it can be seen as the insanity of logic—that formula that aims at accounting for the eternal and the infinitely various and potential. In Gravity's Rainbow, for instance, Pyncheon under the mantle of humor shows us a grotesque truth—that paranoia is a perfect, absolute analogue to art. It can only function as a metaphor for art by being a perfect one—that is, as form, everything is accounted for, in a conspiracy/persecution interpretation. Because, apparent ly, it is simultaneously true in form and false in basis, once one gets outside the organic definition of itself that it gives, paranoia-as-art-as-paranoia il lustrates the very meaningfulness of excess by which comedy works. Its 4A three-ring circus is a good analogy. In the first ring is a group of men in motley with exaggerated human features, bulbous noses, leering eyes, tragic smiles—the clowns, or comedians. In the second ring are the tumblers and acrobats, human pinwheels in the air that delight us with a sympathetic pleasure. In the third ring, the drama of basic life survival is parodied, as the liontamer terrifies us by turning his back on the snarling man-eater. The circus is an organization of emotional modes that goes back to the be ginning of our social existence. It is humor defined in action.</page><page sequence="6">6 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? point then becomes this: that the insane purposefulness, the mad logic of the modern world—which is the first to seek within itself for reason—is a joke on, by, or through the very universe itself.5 All that men endure may be funny, may be a joke, but it certainly is not trivial. If truth is serious, then humor, of necessity, is serious, for one way or another humor always strives after the essence of a situation, its truth. Such things as disparity and incongruity can only function in relation to a fixed point, which they thereby define. By analogy and controlled emotional reaction, which is to say by an exercise of intellect, humor reveals life as paradox—the simultaneous existence of mutually contradictory, fundamental truth. Tragedy achieves a similar result by different means. Humor em phasizes the incongruity of the paradox, the violation of logic; while tragedy reveals the pain of it. Both humor and tragedy, thus, are serious when they function as fully achieved art—though, in an significant distinction, neither is ever in its own nature self-important. Each can use excess—as Shakespeare and Cervantes have showed us—but should not be used by it. Tragedy carried too far in that way becomes bathos; comedy carried too far becomes pointless burlesque or exultant brutality. Too, humor is always calculated procedure; without any touch of the intellect in it, it is at best a physical comedy; generally it is an exercise of malicious assertion, where the normally responsive sympathies are corrupted to a form of brutality or lust, as in the painting of a dog's buttocks with turpentine. Some critics believe that a fixed moral sense is essential to healthy humor, noting that there is today no longer a common agreement on morality, as social definitions melt, merge, and re-shape themselves by the hour. It may be that the true intellect itself is a form of morality in which justice, in the form of just proportion (its basic Platonic definition) triumphs. However, if our age is less capable of humor than was the nineteenth century, it is more apt to be because of a pervasive and general uncertainty, rather than because of the loss of whatever was embodied in Christian morality of an institu tionalized kind. Actually, few great writers have ever made much high art out of the special stuff of Christian truth. Even Milton, when he came to ■""'Contrary to the general view, such madness is not a private experience in anything other than occurrence; it is totally social in that Conspiracy extends to become total form for the universe. Nothing is left outside it. Every meeting, every action, every individual motive, all relationships—all history—is a part of the Total Conspiracy, which if finally uncovered would be a viewing of the Face of God, to see which is death. Life, then, as totally purposeful is the mind as a self-destroying mechanism, the compulsion to slip into the Black Fortress and discover who has rigged the death machine. The analogy of Art and paranoia is complete in Pyncheon's novel. Since Art is the highest achievement of purposeful form in human experience, Art as such is the template of life, which means that life is the plaster cast that Death, working through energy, cunningly devised. The life of the universe thus is a magnificent joke, dada-esque, absolute purposefulness in the cause of non-purpose. The only perfect murder is one perfectly organized, without a motive. A comic one. In a purposeful but unjustified universe, all death thus is Murder. As Art, Murder should not mean, but be. Death exists to perpetuate itself, and uses life as its tool—to reverse the more familiar concept. God as a cry in the street (Joyce's phrase) may be human unhappiness to the Marxists; to Joyce himself, and to a fabulist such as Pyncheon, that cry is the sound of laughter, the incongruity of immense structure and purposefulness towards an end meaningless other than as itself.</page><page sequence="7">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 1 write his Christian epic, presented human drama, with human consequences, very much in the same fashion as did the Greeks. Speaking of the Greeks, the messengers in their dramas, as well as Shake speare's fools, remind us that humor is a way of getting away with the truth. It is a defense for man when his strength is that of the intellect, primarily; the exploits of Odysseus were a series of practical jokes carried out against the Cyclops, Circe, Penelope's suitors, not to mention the Trojans, earlier. The humorist of sentiment and the humorist of comedy are the dreaming poet and the royal fool, originally derived from the same conscientious objectors to ordinary military service, perhaps even tenants of the same body. The knowledge that art gives does not teach us to get the food, or light the fire; but afterwards, we need it to tell us what we are doing sitting before the fire, at all. The poet and the fool are the articulate voices that speak at the symposium ("the drinking-together") when the hunt or the battle is over. Art begins as entertainment (entre tenir), a "bringing together," a "holding together." As with the theoretical tree falling in the empty forest, there is no art without audience, no audience without leisure, the coming together in a mood open to share whatever need lies beyond the stomach. It begins, then, somewhere on the margin beyond animal necessity as entertainment; already built into it is a looseness, an amiability that is the first symptom of play. Art is born, in other words, with an inherent tendency towards humor. In fact, most of the great writers of history have been writers of humor in one or another of its forms, ranging from subtle irony to cheerful high spirits to broad burlesque. John Bunyan and John Wilmot (Earl of Roches ter), the holy commoner and the aristocratic libertine, alike looked at life and found it evocative of warm or bitter laughter in its multiple gaps be tween intent and actuality, between the word and the deed. Whatever else it is, one of the characteristics of humor is incongruity—the mistaking of sheep for armies, or armies for sheep: the illusion that breaks down before reality, but which re-groups itself on the other side of reality as a more significant truth. We laugh, when we respectably can, at variations from the norm. And as normalcy changes, what we find amusing necessarily follows after. Our grandfather's normal garb is a masquerade costume for us. Nineteenth century humor, then, not surprisingly, is different in its referents from eighteenth cen tury humor or twentieth century humor by some degrees. Yet, referents are keys or tokens for things, not the nature of the thing itself, so humor partakes of the eternal paradox—while it is from one age to the next different, in another sense it ever remains the same. We are always surprised to discover that the same life beats in both the elephant and the earthworm. But the better we know a thing, the less we are deceived by its outward appearance. The one thing that may come as close as we ever get to a basic definition of humor—broad though it is, and various as are its forms—is delight in life, a positive fulfilling of the human experience emotionally. Of the two branches that I have labeled as the humor of comedy and the humor of sentiment, the first, comedy, is a revelation of the incongruity of the human experience in which the recognition element—the intellect—remains paramount and in one way or another satisfies us; in contrast, the humor of sentiment yields,</page><page sequence="8">8 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and. Warmth of Wiser Men? through disparity, a cherishing of the life experience as a fitting emotional consciousness (just as sentimentality is a falsifying of experience through the excess of spurious emotion; that is, emotion for its own sake).6 Comic humor reveals itself through many forms: irony, parody, physical humor in which juxtaposition is realized as incongruous or absurd, intellectually,. .. The humor of sentiment is less defined, but has various modes, too. The humor of sentiment is basic in domestic affairs (the best part of Adam Be de, for instance), child-raising, love relationships of all kinds—the warmth of experience wherein joy is generated. More subject to counterfeiting because it does not employ the armed guard of skepticism as a preliminary char acteristic, sentiment at its worst is the flagrant misuse of the emotions seen in Disneyesque commercialism (though one generation's commercialism may turn into a later generation's folk tradition). At its best, it is, say, Dickens' unabashed sense of goodness in personal relationships—Joe Gargery, Pick wick himself, even the much satirized Tiny Tim. Outside literature, one need only look at the humorous ingredient in the happiness of a positive mother child relationship to see its natural validity: when warmed by a positive emotional tie, which it feeds back in turn, life certainly seems to begin with a period of high good humor. (Small children who are loved are explicitly happy, constantly engaging in verbal and physical jokes; everything else aside, so are their parents in the relationship with them. The same seems to be true of romantic love relationships, which at their most fulfilled and least distorted always include a strong element of play and delight). Humor as comedy; humor as sentiment—the intellect and the emotions, wit and warmth. The nineteenth century was probably as well balanced in the two areas as any period in our history. For our part, three-quarters of a century later, it is probably the humor of sentiment—warmth—that we are least able to understand, for not simply moral values but all of the institutions that nurtured and protected it have changed radically. Tradition itself is shot full of the holes of modern skepticism. Yet there is an importance to this warmth that makes it worth the effort of understanding that brings about retrieval; more to this area of humor than merely valuing a thing with the proper dollop of sentiment. Definition, even in the area of one's feelings, exists by contrast, and not simply that of the presence of joy in the absence of sorrow, but in more subtle ways. That is, a feeling of sentimental affection, by the fact that it is sentimental, is in excess of the occasion. It is appropriate to the situation, let us say, but over-appropriate to the degree of need implicit in the situation that calls it forth. As a result, it becomes itself the source of a counter ®Oscar Wilde's cynicism, as Byron's irony, seems to us today to define the real person, which would suggest that his public celebration of feeling were a sham, much like that admitted by Bunthorne in Patience. Yet Wilde sincerely believed in valid sentiment: "A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing" is more than idle wit. (It is also a line that invites paraphrase: "A sentimentalist is a person who knows the value of everything and the price of nothing." Wilde, himself, comes near that line with another of his aphorisms: "A sentimentalist is simply one who desires to have the luxury of an emotion without paying for it," The statement leaves sentiment, itself, intact as a value.)</page><page sequence="9">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 9 impulse; it engenders a rueful self-mockery. Frequently, however, this self mockery does not cancel out the sentimentality, or at least not the main body of it; it exists parallel with it as a compound feeling: soft responsiveness tempered by a biting edge. The result is sentiment of a self-conscious kind, not disavowed but admitted. This concession frees it from the requirement of high seriousness, allowing the possessor to enjoy it without being accountable for it, for it becomes an exercise of chosen temperament, an admitted display of human nature, an instance of self-realizing humor. This simultaneous holding together of contradictory impulses, which serve to define each other, would seem in varying ways to fuse sentiment with elements of satire, of irony, of burlesque, and of parody. This idea accounts in part for the fact that writers as disparate as Jane Austen and Franz Kafka equally are creators of humor. Between the writer and reader and the work itself is always the tacit recognition of a gap in total commitment to the basic or central attitude engendered by the story. As I have already noted about humor, this does not mean that the situation is not serious, for it certainly is consequential, when properly done, valuable, and perhaps even crucial. The juxtaposition of opposing perceptions has been noted in theories of comedy repeatedly, and is quite central to such views as those of George Meredith. However, generally it is associated with a moral rationalism, in which the disparity is seen as a crevice through which a corrective chisel may be inserted. The observing mind acts as judge or referee between op posing attitudes. That humor as a general rule probably demands no cor rective response (which element, when present, then is understood as merely one sub-genre, didactic humor), but is self-contained or satisfied in itself, what might be called a lyric emotion, such as requited love, or peaceful contentedness, or that joy that comes from seeing a natural landscape or listening to music, seems to be less evident. There is probably even a formal aesthetic element in such humor, in which the form of juxtaposition, the novelty of the paradox seen as fully achieved and held in balance, is itself the value; the structure of the relationship of the ideas charging each other actively is an intense satisfaction. This is a contribution of that part of the territory of humor that the conceptual intellect—as opposed to wit, an operative aspect of intellect—occupies. The intellect, like life itself, does not exist necessarily to serve some higher, undefined function; it may be, in the old phrase, "self-delighting," and nowhere more so than in partnership with sentiment. Theoretically, then, there is a humor of intellect, or wit; a humor of sentiment or warmth; and a more-or-less aesthetically self-contained merging of the two in a self-realized and self-gratifying consciousness. At this point, we might consider at least the first two through samples, for even more than it is true of tragedy, literary humor only exists in the specific statement. II There is probably no better-known scene of nineteenth-century sentiment than Dickens' rhapsody on the death of Little Nell—or at least none so</page><page sequence="10">] 0 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? notorious for its apparent sentimentality. Excerpted out of context, it appears even more so : "Angel hands have strewn the ground deep with snow, that the lightest footsteps may be lighter yet: and the very birds are dead, that they may not wake her. She used to feed them, Sir. Though never so cold and hungry, the timid things would fly from us. They never flew from her!" She was dead. No sleep so beautiful and calm, so free from trace of pain, so fair to look upon. She seemed a creature fresh from the hand of God, and waiting for the breath of life: not one who had lived and suffered death. Her couch was dressed with here and there some winter berries and green leaves, gathered in a spot she had been used to favour. "When I die, put near me something that has loved the light and had the sky above it always." Those were her words. She was dead. Dear, gentle, patient, noble Nell was dead. Her little bird—a poor slight thing the pressure of a finger would have crushed— was stirring nimbly in its cage: and the strong heart of its child-mistress was mute and motionless for ever. Where were the traces of her early cares, her sufferings, and fatigues? All gone. Sorrow was dead indeed in her, but peace and perfect happi ness were born; imaged in her tranquil beauty and profound repose. And still her former self lay there, unaltered in this change. Yes. The old fireside had smiled upon that same sweet face; it had passed like a dream through haunts of misery and care ... at the still bedside of the dying boy, there had been the same mild lovely look. So shall we know the angels in their majesty, after death. "It is not," said the schoolmaster, as he bent down to kiss her on the cheek, and gave his tears free vent, "it is not on earth that Heaven's justice ends. Think what it is, compared with the World to which her young spirit has winged its early flight, and say, if one deliberate wish expressed in solemn terms above this bed could call her back to life, which of us would utter it!"7 (Chapter LXXI, The Old Curiosity Shop) It would take, said Oscar Wilde, a man with a heart of stone to read of the death of Little Nell—without laughing. Wilde was right; but in being right, he does not sweep away with a stroke Dickens' scene. On the contrary, he unintentionally points up that aspect of humor to which reference was made when it was said that, at times, in its very exaggeration of reality, sentiment can add a richness that the critical intelligence scoffs at defensively because the level of the scene has been transferred solely to the emotions—art as warmth, pure effect, rather than as discrimination or specific judgement. Yet, conversely, Wilde himself is not invalidated by the situation; the humor of his observation paradoxically re mains effective at its own level. The wit of his comment, in brief, is a true one. Meanwhile, we can enjoy both the warmth of Dickens and the wit that "In the next few lines, we learn that Nell has, in fact, been dead for two days. Angelic child she may have been, but putrefaction is inexorable.</page><page sequence="11">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 11 criticizes it, simultaneously. Moreover, we can experience them separately, or together, and—in the broad sense of the word—learn from both, at the same time, of the paradox, the nature, the delight of life. Wilde, whose mind was both his measure and his treasure house, said almost everything. But he did not, as Dickens could, dare to be free emotionally in his writing. For him, the tragedy of life was its very lack of order, and behind his drollery and wit is a belief in form as necessity that ranges from art to personal action and experience. But if he shaped his own life as a work of high tragedy, some of the materials were the finest pieces of wit that the century produced. The laughter of innocence and the laughter of mockery—the beginning and the end of life. Wilde deserves the gentle epitaph of his own line: "Laughter is not a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is the best ending for one." So perhaps his judgement of Little Nell was not really inappropriate. The humor of sentiment, the humor of comedy: the ingenuousness of the child or the primitive played against the wisdom of their instincts, or the jaded intellect that has filled to capacity with experience and sees life as a joke, good or bad. Dickens himself probably best reveals the seriousness of concern of a comic writer in the close correlation that he draws between the extravagant emotion that produces joy and that which produces terror. Another well known passage, this one from Dombey and Son, gives us the death scene of the villain, Carker, who receives retribution under the wheels of a railroad train. There is nothing merely casual about it: A trembling of the ground, and quick vibration in his ears: a distant shriek: a dull light advancing, quickly changed to two red eyes, and a fierce fire, dropping glowing coals; an irresistible bearing on of a great roaring and dilating mass; a high wind, and a rattle—another come and gone, and he holding to a gate, as if to save himself! He waited for another, and for another... and still looked for those approaching monsters. He loitered about the station, waiting until one should stay to call there: and when one did, and was detached for water, he stood parallel with it, watching its heavy wheels and brazen front, and thinking what a cruel power and might it had. Ugh! to see the great wheels slowly turning, and to think of being run down and crushed! then, a page and a half later: He heard a shout—another... felt the earth tremble—knew in a moment that the rush was come-—uttered a shriek—looked round—saw the red eyes, bleared and dim, in the daylight, close upon him—was beaten down, caught up, and whirled away upon a jagged mill, that spun him round and round, and struck him limb from limb, and licked his stream of life up with its fiery heat, and cast his mutilated frag ments into the air. (Chapter LV, Dombey and Son, 1846-48) In his most effective and critical moments, Dickens becomes, as here, the author of Death's Jest Book. There is, in a chilling way, something comic, parodie, about the death of Carker, however horrifying in another sense; a quality that is, as we shall subsequently see, present in most of his stories.</page><page sequence="12">12 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? Dickens uses exaggeration positively, as an intensification of experience, achieving very much what Conrad, at the end of the century, in the Preface to Nigger of the Narcissus, spoke of as the vital necessity to make his readers feel, above all, "to make you see" the story he was telling. Dickens, in brief, uses shock as a special device, the humor of exaggeration as a control, to convey a serious truth, doing it in the same fashion, say, as Kafka was to, in the early twentieth century.8 The question is inevitable: can a death scene of this sort properly be called humor without openly confirming a positive approach to life, without a clearing of darkness; does it perhaps even require an explicit enhancement of life as such, through the scene, before we can accept the word humor in such a connection? I'm inclined to say that this scene does, in fact, create something positive along such lines. In Dantesque terms, the railroad train is a projection of human qualities, an expression in snorting steel of human brutality, of retribution for a nature that sees its own villainy externalized and made universal and impersonal, and thereby is itself exposed, made trivial and helpless before the incarnate lust of itself come to destroy it. The engine is a vengeful god, the eyes are death rays; the guilty Carker literally offers himself to it, a hypnotized victim of Moloch. The exaggerated sentiment is that of the desire for purification with which the scene floods the reader. Melodramatic to the nth degree, it is so openly that, that it transforms the universe of the novel. Like the death of Little Nell, it bears the reader along on a flood, a wash of intense feeling, from which an assertion of logic would free him at any time (with a self conscious laugh)—but it is a liberation that a reader rarely seeks. Certainly few of the first generation of readers of Dombey and Son could have sought it, for it was vintage emotional inebriant of Dickens' finest distillation. Humor? In a complex way, of course it is, raising our pulse to a beat that is certainly a form of delighted excitement. Dickens here is his own Fat Boy, making our flesh crawl; and we are happy in the sensation. The railway, as such, provides us with a number of comparative samples in an analysis of nineteenth century humor. Another railway description by Dickens, this one without a death included, shows many of the same qualities but is clearly an instance of a specific kind of humor achieved frequently by the author; as I earlier noted, closely allied to that humor that brings us delight is a humor of intensified emotional experience based on excitement. That is, in a given passage, the reason for a description will not be simply to provide a setting for a plot action: the emotional content of the description exceeds such a need. Rather, it is its own excuse for being, a self-justified heightening of involvement of the reader with the experience by making it one of lyric excitement. Again, the passage is drawn from Dombey and Son, though a good bit earlier in the book than Carker's death scene. Through the hollow, on the height, by the heath, by the orchard, by the park, by the garden, over the canal, across the river, where the sheep are feeding, where the mill is going, where the barge is floating, 8Mark Spilka (Dickens and Kafka) detailed the relationship quite fully several years ago; the tie between Dickens and other modems, such as Faulkner, continues to unfold to an ever-increasing degree, cf. Albert J. Guerard's Martin Chuzzlewit essay from his study of Dickens, Dostoevsky, and Faulkner.</page><page sequence="13">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 13 where the dead are lying, where the factory is smoking, where the stream is running, where the village clusters, where the great cathedral rises, where the bleak moor lies, and the wild breeze smooths or ruffles it at its inconstant will: away with a shriek, and a roar, and a rattle, and no trace to leave behind but dust and vapour: like as in the track of the remorseless monster, Death! Breasting the wind and light, the shower and sunshine, away, and still away, it rolls and roars, fierce and rapid, smooth and certain, and great works and massive bridges crossing up above, fall like a beam of shadow an inch broad upon the eye, and then are lost. Away, and still away, onward and onward ever: glimpses of cottage homes, of houses, of mansions, rich estates, of husbandry and handicraft, of people, of old roads and paths that look deserted, small, and insignificant as they are left behind : and so they do, and what else is there but such glimpses, in the track of the indomitable monster, Death! ... Away once more into the day, and through the day, with a shrill yell of exultation, roaring, rattling, tearing on, spurning everything with its dark breath, sometimes pausing for a minute where a crowd of faces are, that in a minute more are not: sometimes lapping water greedily, and before the spout at which it drinks has ceased to drip upon the ground, shrieking, roaring, rattling through the purple dis tance! Louder and louder yet, it shrieks and cries as it comes tearing on resistless to the goal: and now its way still like the way of Death, is strewn with ashes thickly! (Chapter XX., Dombey and Son, 1846-48) We are accustomed now to thinking of the early twentieth century as the period in which distinctions between prose and poetry were broken down, particularly, say, in the novels of Virginia Woolf. However, the cadence and intensity, even the careful relationship of the images in the above passage— "where the great cathedral rises/where the bleak moor lies" ... "fall like a beam of shadow"... "of houses, mansions, rich estates/of husbandry and handicraft"—result in a prose poem of considerable effect. (In recent years, Dickens has been in danger of becoming the prose Shakespeare, scarcely to be criticized so much as more richly appreciated. However, it would be interesting, if nothing else, to see some of his intense passages purged of just enough purple to let the glittering rapidity of language emerge fully). The railroad was a profound psychological experience to the mid-nine teenth century. Just as Henry Adams at the beginning of the twentieth was to have his "historical neck broken" and realize that the homocentric uni verse had vanished, when he first saw the hall of dynamos humming with immense, inhuman, motiveless power at the Paris Exhibition, Dickens, Mel ville, and others a half century earlier saw the created power of civilization rumbling away from man's control, impersonally crushing him if he were so careless as to step in its way. A horse had motives, needs, action, caprice of its own. But the locomotive was a hubristic notion made animate, an image of man's ability exceeding his grasp, the mechanical force that was visible in the roaring fire and brimstone of myth now rushing down the pathways of one's own home territory, filling the imagination with a riot of excitement. Dickens' own imagination ran on, pell-mell, past the clanking boiler on wheels to universal principles of malice and chuckling metals released from the</page><page sequence="14">14 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? dark mines of the underworld by man's own destructive lusts in their determination to embody themselves. That such a visible symbol reached out from the dreams—or nightmares —of men in some common way is clear, if we carry the point a little further. Here is Herman Melville, writing at approximately the same time as Dickens, in his splendid short story "Cock-a-Doodle-Doo, or the Crowing of the Noble Cock Benventano," a tale equally as Kafkaesque, and even more perversely humorous, than "Bartleby," though nowhere near so well known. The speaker of the following lines is a character looking at the world through a consciously jaundiced eye, but in a comic sense. Note the resemblance to Dickens' descriptive approach. Great improvements of the age! What! to call the facilitation of death and murder and improvement! Who wants to travel so fast? My grandfather did not, and he was no fool. Hark! here comes that old dragon again—that gigantic gadfly of a Moloch—snort! puff! scream!— here he comes straight-bent through these vernal woods, like the Asiatic cholera cantering on a camel. Stand aside! Here he comes, the chartered murderer! the death monopolizer! judge, jury, and hangman all to gether, whose victims die always without benefit of clergy. For two hundred and fifty miles the iron fiend goes yelling through the land, crying "More! more! more!" (Herman Melville, "Cock-a-Doodle-Doo") To discover that Thoreau approved of the railway, on the whole, probably surprises most readers, at first thought. Yet, the crustiest of the Concord sages was also, despite his idealism, a pragmatist, who saw the accomplish ment of work as a positive good. His view of the railway, nonetheless, is based on a similar emotional intensity. .. . when I hear the iron horse make the hills echo with his snort like thunder, shaking the earth with his feet, and breathing fire and smoke from his nostrils (what kind of winged horse or fiery dragon they will put into the new Mythology, I don't know), it seems as if the earth had got a race now worthy to inhabit it. If all were as it seems, and men made the elements their servants for noble ends! ... All day the fire-steed flies over the country, stopping only that his master may rest, and I am awakened by his tramp and defiant snort at midnight, when in some remote glen in the woods he fronts the elements incased in ice and snow; and he will reach his stall only with the morning star, to start once more on his travels without rest or slumber.... To do things "railroad fashion" is now the byword; and it is worth the while to be warned so often and so sincerely by any power to get off its track. There is no stopping to read the riot act, no firing over the heads of the mob, in this case. We have constructed, an Atropos, that never turns aside. (Let that be the name of your engine). ("Sounds," Waiden) In each case there is a recognition by these writers of a certain quality of the mind, a projection of human ambition and desire, given shape in the external universe; and to each in different ways it is an intensely exciting idea, that they wish to communicate as excitement. In contrast to these three prose</page><page sequence="15">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 15 writers, there was Emily Dickinson, writing at the same time, on the same subject, in a world she knows better than they do, at least in one small corner. I like to see it lap the Miles— And lick the Valleys up— And stop to feed itself at Tanks And then—prodigious step Around a Pile of Mountains— And supercilious peer In shanties—by the side of Roads And then a Quarry pare To fit its Ribs And crawl between Complaining all the while In horrid—hooting stanza— Then chase itself down Hill— And neigh like Boanerges— Then—punctual as a star Stop—docile and omnipotent At its own stable door— (J.585. 1862) The contrast is instructive. The poet has completely domesticated the iron beast, made it a comfortable and friendly magic dragon. Where Dickens and Melville, and Thoreau to a somewhat lesser extent, conceived of the monster as a precarious human adventure, as exciting, Emily Dickinson sees it pri marily as delightful. Clearly, hers is an assertion of will, perhaps a selfishness, perhaps simply an inner turning that makes the outer world much less terrible a place than one might have thought in her life (personal relationships were another matter). The movement of the train across the landscape is centered upon; it becomes evocative of something of the same unearthly delicacy as Sandburg's fog (or Eliot's, in "Prufrock"), but much more bumbling than sinister. Lapping the miles and licking the valleys up, it is more harmonious a creature in nature than is the juggernaut of Dickens, which brings rushing doom and ashen death upon the trembling earth. Each description, however, is humor of a specific kind; each uses the control of excess that allows us to experience emotionally without the rigidity of absolute belief. A century of literary humor necessarily involves a wide variety of subjects and treatments. Jane Austen's novels are sometimes thought of as the last great work of eighteenth century prose. Few readers today would be apt to argue against the view that all of her stories are comedies, or more properly what we have been calling the humor of sentiment, although certainly there is injected into them the vital yeast of wit. The novels of Peacock, even more obviously, are comic novels, and one could make a similar claim for Scott's historical novels on certain grounds. By 1818, the date Frankenstein was published, the Gothic mode had lost much of the outrageously absurd (but—</page><page sequence="16">16 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? properly regarded—rich) humor with which it had distinguished itself in the second half of the eighteenth century.9 But the early 1800s was a period of high achievement in poetry and the prose of non-fiction, obviously. Stuart Tave has noted The Amiable Humorist of the period, and if present directions are significant, we are finally beginning to appreciate Wordsworth as a poet capable of projecting attitudes so successfully that we have failed to see the difference between the poetic voice and the poet's voice. Shelley, capable of great indignation, could also be the most playful poet of his age—perhaps, in some ways, a more humorous one than Byron. Coleridge, on the other hand, remains a very serious fellow to us, despite Christabel, Kubla Khan, and certain features of The Ancient Mariner that seem subject to humorous interpretation on the same grounds as, say, Melville. However, certain ex plicitly comic verse did come from Coleridge's pen. (The fact that it is explicitly comic may explain why we call it verse rather than poetry; it amounts to the same thing as a work that is determinedly tragic). The piece "Cologne" is a satire of cultures, almost brutal in its contempt. But it is smoothly flowing and effective, even if not great poetry, for its subject is not great; the rhythm redeems the mood, so to speak. In Köln, a town of monks and bones, And pavements fanged with murderous stones, And rags, and hags, and hideous wenches, I counted two-and-seventy stenches, All well defined, and separate stinks! Ye nymphs that reign o'er sewers and sinks, The river Rhine, it is well known, Doth wash your city of Cologne; But tell me, nymphs, what power divine Shall henceforth wash the river Rhine? ("Cologne") On the other hand, his little squib "Giles' Hope" is a kind of punning aphorism, proving that even great poets can be bad ones in a good cause. 90f course, the eighteenth century had more than its share of outrageously absurd humor, or adult fairy tales, to use a more descriptive label. Horace Walpole's rococo gothic (the scrambled category suits the scrambled conception) house at Strawberry Hill was only a minor manifestation in the real world of a brilliantly absurd imagination. As Marvin Mudrick, in his Introduction to the Collier Edition of The Castle of Otranto says of Walpole: "Under the rationalist skin, a grinning skull, a hankering after chaos and old night." Walpole's Hieroglyphic Tales, privately printed in his old age in a Wildean-like gesture of six copies, included "The King and his Three Daughters," in volving the marrying-off of a girl who has "never taken the trouble to be born," and "The Peach in Brandy," which title refers to a still-born foetal heir-apparent, kept around in a pickle jar, which an archbishop mistakes for a brandied peach. "He gulped it all down at once without saying grace. God forgive him!" The five-year old Queen thereupon cries out, "Momma, momma, the gentleman has eat my little brother." The action is gratuitous in the sense of the true Absurd and so goes considerably beyond even such humorously titillating work as The Castle of Otranto itself or Lewis's The Monk. The adult fairy tale, again, is primarily a humor of delight, setting on its ear the world of reasoned cause and effect and so freeing us of necessity to be, to believe, to perform, according to practical social definitions.</page><page sequence="17">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 17 "What! rise again with all one's bones?" Quoth Giles. "I hope you fib. I trusted, when I went to heaven, To go without my rib." ("Giles' Hope") It is, of course, simply another unaimed shot in the eternal war of the sexes (of which men have had far and away more time than they deserve to state their case). As the two poems of Coleridge suggest, one problem traditionally with humorous writing is that when done consciously, it seems to come to mind as a proper mode to express the trivial. (As Tolstoy said, "All happy families are alike, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." An apt thought, but not quite true, as Chekhov proved). It is well to remember that humor can be more subtle; the emotion evoked by warm humor is positive, that of the appreciation of life, the acceptance of it; while that of tragedy is a recognition of life indifferent to, or even denying, the self, and consequently more dramatic in nature. Nonetheless, the great poets of humor in the earlier part of the century cannot be stretched to include Coleridge. Byron, on the other hand, was in disputably a master at comic narrative in verse, which frequently involved social criticism, though that was not its primary value. Rather, it was work of rich intellectual amusement—writing that very clearly brought out for us the pleasure of paradox. Don Juan is too well-known for illustration here; a less masterful and elaborate work such as "The Devil's Drive" shows the technique to fine effect, however. The devil returned to hell by two, And he stayed at home till five; When he dined on some homicides done in ragoût, And a rebel or so in an Irish stew And sausages made of a self-slain Jew— And bethought himself what next to do, "And," quoth he, "I'll take a drive. I walked in the morning, I'll ride tonight; In darkness my children take most delight, And I'll see how my favorites thrive." ("The Devil's Drive," 11.1-10) Insofar as the poem was completed, it goes on, predictably, as a tour of battle fields, scenes of poverty, and government institutions, referring by name to some of the author's contemporaries, to show how well the world does the Devil's work. But, like many such poems, the technical skill probably does little to convince us additionally of the moral point; on the contrary, it leaves the Devil as a witty, rather elegant fellow. In the eternal war of literature, between the poet and the critic, however, Byron was one of the great generals of all time, with his English Bards and Scotch Reviewers one of the more successful assaults ever launched. A model of didactic verse, with its tone that of scathing contempt and summary judgement, it would be impossible to conceive it without its humorous character.</page><page sequence="18">18 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? A man must serve his time to ev'ry trade Save censure; critics all are ready-made. Take hackney'd jokes from Miller, got by rote, With just enough of learning to misquote; Fear not to lie—twill seem a sharper hit; Shrink not from blasphemy—'twill pass for wit; Care not for feeling; pass your proper jest And stand a critic, hated yet caress'd. (English Bards and Scotch Reviewers, 11. 63-66, 71-74) Yet, in the long run, simple Time buries most critics in obscurity, and it is not Byron's thunderbolts against Jeffrey "pertest of the pack," or Holland, "with Henry Petty at his back,/The whipper-in and huntsman of the pack" that remain with us, so much as his own assessments of older poets. Oh! Southey! Southey! cease they varied song! A bard may chant too often and too long: Next comes the dull disciple of thy school, That mild apostate from poetic rule, The simple Wordsworth, framer of a lay As soft as evening in his favourite May, Who, both by precept and example, shows That prose is verse, and verse is merely prose;10 Convincing all, by demonstration plain, Poetic souls delight in prose insane; And Christmas stories tortured into rhyme Contain the essence of the true sublime. Thus, when he tells the tale of Betty Foy, The idiot mother of "an idiot boy"; A moon-struck, silly lad, who lost his way, And, like his bard, confounded night with day; So close on each pathetic part he dwells, And each adventure so sublimely tells, That all who view the "idiot in his glory" Conceive the bard the hero of the story. Shall gentle Coleridge pass unnoticed here, To turgid ode and tumid stanza dear? The bard who soars to elegise an ass. So well the subject suits his noble mind, He brays the lauréat of the long-ear'd kind. (English Bards and Scotch Reviewers, 11. 234-264) 10c/. Oscar Wilde's "Meredith is a prose Browning and so is Browning; he used poetry as a medium for writing in prose."</page><page sequence="19">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 19 Distinguished satirical verse of this sort has not survived very well into the twentieth century, of course. What we have is apt to be in a minor key, the poking of fun at casual things around us, humorous social criticism. Thomas Moore's exasperation with what was, even in the early 1800s, the ubiquitous English tourist, was the sort of thing that has engaged shoals of minor present-day versifiers. And is there, then, no earthly place Where we can rest in dream Elysian, Without some cursed round English face Popping up near to break the vision? And if this rage for traveling lasts, If cockneys of all sets and castes, Old maidens, aldermen, and squires, Will leave their puddings and coal fires, To gape at things in foreign lands No soul among them understands; Who knows, if to the West we roam, But we may find some Blue "at home" Among the Blacks of Carolina, Or, flying to the eastward, see Some Mrs. Hopkins taking tea And toast upon the Wall of China? "Eternal London," passim. Point, or subject, is all, here, and so invites dog-rime, since sing-song em phasizes pointed mockery. In a poem such as "Lying," Moore reverts to another highly stylized convention of humorous verse, in this instance, a Jacobean cynicism through paradox. The art, while capable, is somewhat less than that of a Suckling or a Marvell. But, then, it is the sentimental charm of the "Irish Melodies" that Moore does best, anyway. Long as you're false and he believes you, Long as you trust and he deceives you, So long the blissful bud endures; And while he lies, his heart is yours, But, oh! you've wholly lost the youth The instant that he tells you truth! (from "Lying") A poem of this sort reminds us that, by definition, paradox is essentially a comic device. It leads us, also, to one of the comic forms that fascinated the nineteenth century, although it was a form that had matured in the preceding hundred years. I am referring to the "one-liner"; the aphorism, or punch line</page><page sequence="20">20 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? of a witty turn, almost invariably based on a paradox of one sort or another.11 The great age of folk wisdom becoming fixed in print was the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the capturing of the oral tradition from nursery tales to ancient English ballads. The wisdom of folk humor was inordinately fixed in the process, for long after many of the referents have passed away, we still use the expressions compulsively; carts before horses, noses to the grind stone, shoulders to the wheel (obviously, six-foot-high wheels), being on tenterhooks. In fact, almost all such sayings are tied to domestic exercises that no longer are familiar; few of us nowadays even take stitches—in time, or out. However, nineteenth century society saw itself ideally as verbal, and sophisticated wit is everywhere valued in its literature. Climaxing at the end of the century in Oscar Wilde and the early Shaw, the art of the one-liner had been brought to great effect earlier through the elegant wit of Sydney Smith, and others. A sampling, with observations: "He thinks by infection, catching an opinion like a cold" (John Ruskin). The statement uses a limited image that totally contains the thought and characterizes it; the analogy becoming a comic symbol, so to speak. "A variety of nothing is better than a monotony of something" (Jean Paul Richter). An "open bag" comment, the wit here plays with reference terms rather than specifics. It could apply to love, money, or any number of other referents—including wit itself. "To be constant in love to one is good; to be constant to many is great" (James Jeffrey Roche). Easily classified as the delightfully wicked invitation to misbehavior, such a comment offers us freedom under the cover of a personal truth which is opposed to a social platitude. The humor consists of its very honesty, which is ludicrous in such a situation. Sydney Smith is worth at least a small volley of quotes, for he engaged in high absurdity as an expression of personality and so, perhaps more than anyone else in the first half of the century, helped to shape the Wildean era as a visible reach after impossibility in the verbal or conceptual sense. For example: "I heard him speaking disrespectfully of the equator," or "I have been looking for a person who disliked gray all my life; let us swear eternal friendship." Or the deliberately outrageous self-involvement, the archness of "My idea of heaven is eating pâtés de foie gras to the sound of trumpets" and "I never read a book before reviewing it; it prejudices one so." It is interesting to remember that his dates (1771-1845) are very close to those of Wordsworth (1770-1850). Perhaps the most enduring of these brief compositions are the aphorisms or capsules of wisdom revealed through wit, frequently in the form of definition. A handful: Oscar Wilde's "Insincerity is merely a method by nThough not necessarily characteristic of his best work, which is in many ways definitive of a humor of sentiment, Charles Lamb expresses the fondness with which his age regarded the pun: "May my last breath be drawn through a pipe and exhaled in a pun." The same author, in a comment on human nature: "I never knew an enemy to puns who was not an ill-natured man." He himself never engaged in the wildly careening effect of runaway words of Thomas Hood or, later, W. S. Gilbert, since his own humor—displayed in the above lines—conveys a genial sentiment of appreciation of the ordinary.</page><page sequence="21">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 21 which we can multiply our personalities," or his loaded "A gentlemen is one who never hurts anyone's feelings unintentionally," or Ruskin's wise snobbery "An artist should be fit for the best society and keep out of it," or George Bernard Shaw's "Martyrdom is the only way in which a man can become famous without ability," or Schopenhauer's snappish "Reading is thinking with someone else's head instead of one's own." What we have in all of these crackling comments is a skepticism, explicitly stated, of the normal value system that exists in assumed definitions. It is the intellectuals' version of folk wisdom, in which the play of idea carries something very much like an electrical shock to jolt us, and so it avoids the sententiousness of much popular folk wisdom—which is its aim. The English novel, in the hands of Dickens, Thackeray, Trollope, and most of the other fiction writers at mid-century rises to a magnificent comic achievement, much too extended to analyze here beyond my earlier observa tions on Dickens.12 The major poets of the period were equally involved with humor: Browning's work, while of profound seriousness, certainly floats on a sea of comedy and sentiment. Based, as much of it is, on a speaker revealing himself, either unconsciously or ruefully, irony is a primary char acteristic; however, Browning has, perhaps, suffered by being regarded a little too solemnly. Like T. S. Eliot, he is frequently thought of as the literary character on whom he has drawn open a curtain. George Meredith's poetical work has an obvious sharpness, even a bitterness, about which we know too much biographical detail; however, it fits neatly the humor of comedies that we earlier defined. Frequently, there is a peculiar paradox native to humor, as in the tension of views by Dickens and Oscar Wilde in relation to the death of Little Nell, discussed earlier. A humor of sentiment will be faced by a humor of comedy; one insists on contradicting the other but without nullifying it. A classic example in Victorian poetry is Tennyson's "The Higher Pantheism" (1869), satirized by Swinburne a few years later in "The Higher Pantheism in a Nut shell." The opening couplets, first, of the Tennyson, to indicate the sense of it and the rhythm : The sun, the moon, the stars, the seas, the hills and the plains,— Are not these, O soul, the Vision of Him who reigns? Is not the Vision He, tho' He be not that which He seems? Dreams are true while they last, and do we not live in Dreams? By no means an empty statement, it is susceptible, obviously. Here are the first four couplets of Swinburne's parody. One, who is not, we see: but one, whom we see not, is: Surely this is not that: but that is assuredly this. 12In an essay now in outline form, I am tracing "Structures of Humor in Wuthering Heights and Heart of Darkness," a title which certainly should have a shock value for unalloyed Blakeians and Jungians. However, part of my earlier discussion here points out the direction taken: Comedy as a control on emotional response, and as an index to a self-awareness of essential human absurdity, can go to thoughts that lie too deep for tears, at the same time that it does a pretty good job on tears.</page><page sequence="22">22 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? What, and wherefore, and whence? for under is over and under: If thunder could be without lightning, lightning could be without thunder. Doubt is faith, in the main: but faith, on the whole, is doubt: We cannot believe by proof: but could we believe without? Why, and whither, and how? for barley and rye are not clover: Neither are straight lines curves: yet over is under and over. Unbelievably, it both gibbers and makes sense. Literary parody was far more common a hundred years ago than it is today, and one is tempted to think that the average writer must have lived much closer to pure ideas and abstractions. Certainly metaphysics was a more normal part of creative literature; we go for dramatic characters instead of thinking ones. A good parody involves an understanding of structure, as in the Swinburne poem above; and the structure of a poem that develops an abstract idea is under stood only as argument, that is one must understand at least the essential bases of the idea. Moreover, anything easily parodied has, itself, a kernel of excess—the comic ingredient—in it. "The Higher Pantheism" of Tenny son could well seem silly to an unsympathetic reader, today; that it did to Swinburne in his day is clear. Parody, by nature, claims to show what a thing really is saying under its obfuscating cover. Swinburne seized this poem at certain points of vulnerability and needed only to deepen the colors of the original—add a little more of the excess—to bring out the comic. It is a worthy tradition, of course; we might refer here to Marlowe's "Pas sionate Shepherd" and Raleigh's satiric answer (only the best of many) to see the two forms of humor yoked together in a positive way. Of the late-century comic poets, the one who is least properly valued is probably Kipling, who still remains largely ignored in our contemporary embarrassment about nineteenth century imperialism—the one Victorian element that has not yet acquired a public nostalgia value. However, Kipling was more than a master of dog-rime remembered fondly by aging patrons of pubs. In a comic poem such as "The Conundrum of the Workshops," literary criticism is effectively burlesqued. Some lines from it: When the flush of a new-born sun fell first on Eden's green and gold, Our father Adam sat under the Tree and scratched with a stick in the mould; And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart, Till the Devil whispered behind the leaves, "It's pretty, but is it Art?" They builded a tower to shiver the sky and wrench the stars apart, Till the Devil grunted behind the bricks, "It's striking, but is it Art? The stone was dropped at the quarry-side, and the idle derrick swung,</page><page sequence="23">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 23 While each man talked of the aims of Art, and each in an alien tongue. And each man hears, as the twilight nears to the beat of his dying heart, The Devil drum on the darkened pane, "You did it, but was it Art?" His poem "General Summary" describes a situation that should be close to contemporary readers; it is public satire from the hands of a good workman of words. A few stanzas: Who shall doubt the secret hid Under Cheops' pyramid Was that the contractor did Cheops out of several millions? Or that Joseph's sudden rise To Comptroller of Supplies Was a fraud of monsterous size on King Pharoah's swart civilians? Thus, the artless songs I sing Do not deal with anything New or never said before. As it was in the beginning, Is today official sinning, And shall be forevermore. At which point, we might remember, that Kipling's most notorious poem, one that became an epithet against him, "The White Man's Burden," was a poem of bitter regret. Ill "England and America," said George Bernard Shaw, "are two countries separated by the same language." Humorous writing is even more wide spread in the nineteenth century in America than it is in England, in part perhaps because the folk tradition is one that is largely based on humor. The Neo-Platonic impulse of the great English Romantics was echoed in America, but it would produce nothing like the same level of poetry in the first half of the century. On the other hand, Hawthorne and Poe certainly were not Dickens when it came to comic genius. Nonetheless, the serious major writers of America were capable not only of infusing their better known writings with elements of comedy, but of writing pieces of masterful humor. While the famous Hudson Valley tales of Washington Irving—e.g. "Rip Van Winkle" and "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"—represent a mixture of spoof and gentle ridicule, his Knickerbocker's History of New York is very heavy-handed. Yet, these sweeps of the broad-axe have a real effect, even today; it is difficult not to laugh at the catalogue of besotted figures that he</page><page sequence="24">24 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? parades before us. By mixing just enough of the familiar (to anyone, particu larly, who knows the place names and even a little of the actual history of early New York) with the preposterous, the familiar itself becomes visibly inflated, and the real becomes the comic. Hiding in the pages of history are not demi-gods, but clowns. We are relieved of the seriousness of the real, thereby, and so come to appreciate it on genial grounds. The "Most Horrible Battle Ever Recorded in Poetry or Prose; With the Admirable Exploits of Peter the Headstrong" is a mock epic of mock-heroic proportions, including this assembly of the valiant: Then came waddling on the sturdy chivalry of the Hudson. There were the Van Wycks, and the Van Dycks, and the Ten Eycks—the Van Nesses, the Van Tassels, the Van Grolls; the Van Hoesens, the Van Gie sons, and the Van Blarcoms—the Van Warts, the Van Winkles, the Van Dams; the Van Pelts, the Van Rippers, and the Van Brunts. There were the Van Homes, the Van Hooks, the Van Bunschotens; the Van Gelders, the Van Arsdales, and the Van Bummels; the Vander Belts, the Vander Hoofs, the Vander Voorts, the Vander Lyns, the Vander Pools, and the Vander Spiegles—then came the Hoffmans, the Hooghlands, the Hop pers, the Cloppers, the Rychmans, the Dyckmans, the Hogebooms, the Rosebooms, the Oothouts, the Quakenbosses, the Roerbacks, the Gar rabrantzes, the Bensons, the Brouwers, the Waldrons, the Onderdonks, the Varra Vangers, the Schermerhorns, the Stoutenburghs, the Brinker hoffs, the Bontecous, the Knickerbockers, the Hockstrassers, the Ten Breecheses, and the Tough Breecheses, with a host more of worthies, whose names are too crabbed to be written.... This is phonetic poetry. The names have been arranged, rythmically and with punning effect achieved, by a poetic mind; it is a careful and skilled comedy of sound.1'1 The battle is in the same vein, but by pulling out all of the mock-heroic stops, and having nature itself react in horror, Irving achieves a kind of slapstick madness. The heaven were darkened ... Bang! went the guns—whack! went the broadswords—thump! went the cudgels—crash! went the musket-stocks —blows—-kicks—cuffs—scratches—black eyes and bloody noses swelling the horrors of the scene! Thick thwack, cut and hack, helter-skelter, higgledy-piggledy, hurly-burly, head over heels, rough and tumble! Dunder and blixum! swore the Dutchmen—splitter and splutter! cried the Swedes—Storm the works! shouted Hardkoppig Peter—Fire the mine! roared stout Risingh—Tanta-rarra-ra! twanged the trumpet of Antony Van Corlear—until all voice and sound became unintelligible— grunts of pain, yells of fury, and shouts of triumph mingling in one hideous clamor. The earth shook as if struck with a paralytic stroke— trees shrunk aghast, and withered at the sight—rocks burrowed in the ground like rabbits—and even Christina creek turned from its course, and ran up hill in breathless terror. (Book VI, Chapter VIII) 13Possibly derived from Irving's catalogue is a section of a very different work; the listing of the guests who came to Gatsby's parties in F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. See Chapter IV, pp. 6Iff. of the Scribner Library Edition. Conceptually and rhythmically, the lists are very close.</page><page sequence="25">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 25 While there is more than a hint of ethnic ridicule here, there is, more basically, a correcting of any reverence that we might have for great enter prises. Revealed behind the draped dimness of the forefathers is a cheerful reality, not very different in kind from that of "Rip Van Winkle": .. oyster fed Pavonians and a corps de reserve of the Van Arsdales and Van Bummels, who had remained behind to digest the enormous dinner they had eaten. These now trudged manfully forward, smoking their pipes with outrageous vigor, so as to raise the awful cloud that has been mentioned; but marching exceedingly slow, being short of leg, and of great rotundity in the belt." Irving's comedy is great fun, and one suspects that a reason why America has not taken the Dutch settlement of New York more seriously may have been our literal incapacity to do so, after Diedrich Knickerbocker and Geoffrey Crayon had had their say. If Irving had extended the same service to the Puritan settlers of Massachusetts, the culture of the nation might well have been different. But there were greater writers than Irving in New England. Twentieth century literature is determinedly concerned with revealing "character," which it interprets as psychology, nineteenth century writers thought of character as a revealing of personality. Paradoxically, then, the details of behaviour, individual action, are far more important in themselves in a Dickens than in a Hemingway, where the protagonist is more often presented as caught, a spasmodic reflex in a controlling situation. Dickens, Browning, the Brontës, even George Meredith—allowed their characters a play of movement beside which the characters of Faulkner, or Pyncheon, seem helpless dream figures, seen as though they had been born with the umbilical cord wrapped around their necks, not quite strangling them, but with all of their lives as a consequent convulsion. Perhaps because the authors view characters as personalities rather than as psychologies, figures in nineteenth century literature seem larger, more in command of their setting, more leisurely. The soul is still distinct from the mind, which is used only to figure things out with, the way we carry around pocket calculators. They talk much more, and more authoritatively; they seem to have unused reserves; in Yeats' phrase, they seem to have "a sword upstairs," while their fictional grandchildren always have everything at stake. And since personality, rather than psychology, is being revealed, the Victorian characters speak with greater humor. One result is that talk-scenes, particularly dinners, are much more com mon in the nineteenth century. Since the person, rather than a complicated over-riding action, is being revealed, all that he needs is an occasion for talk; he can get up afterward and go off without notice to Australia, but he doesn't need to do any single thing. Dickens, obviously, Peacock, Thack eray, Browning (e.g. "Bishop Bloughram's Apology") and a multitude of others recognized the social basis for meals, dining as occasion, a formalized activity productive of comedy.14 One of the very best-known comic scenes uPlato, of course, anticipated them in The Symposium and was himself anticipated by Homer, who structured much of The Odyssey as a flashback yarn told by the pro tagonist at Alcinous' banquet. In contrast, many of the looming literary figures of the twentieth century are solitary persons in an unreal or dead landscape; the outsiders of Kafka, Camus, Robbe-Grillet or Beckett never seem to eat real food. Melville's isolato</page><page sequence="26">26 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? in literature is the "Mad Hatter's Tea Party" in Alice in Wonderland. A couple of decades earlier, in America, Edgar Allen Poe's "The System of Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether" (1845) is a fine short tale in the genre, a comic symposium (i.e. "syn" &amp; "posisa drinking-together, an imbibing of ideas and personalities, as well as a primitive ritual of acceptance and harmony between men). One might remember here, in passing, the leaden failure of Twain's "Whittier Birthday Dinner Speech," a gaffe on his part that clearly was motivated by the basic instinct towards the comic of virtually all talk that results from men getting together at a table. (Reading Twain's speech today, we can guffaw without restraint, but it is easy to see why the principals at the time could not). If men want to get practical work done, in fact, it probably is a good idea to avoid lunch or dinner meetings; the intellect is apt to get too playful at such times. Far too little known a story, comparatively speaking, "The System of Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether" is one in which reader and narrator labor under a misunderstanding for much of the time. Visitors to an asylum, we do not know that the madmen have taken it over and are running it. The story has a serious point, too, of course, anticipating twentieth century skepticism about the underlying madness of apparent normalcy in the world.15 On the immediate level, there are a series of brilliant comic strokes in the story that make it hilarious reading. The following passages are ex cerpted in the order given. "We had a fellow here once," said a fat little gentlemen, who sat by my right,—"a fellow who fancied himself a tea-pot; and by the way, is it not especially singular how often this crochet has entered the brain of the lunatic? There is scarcely an insane asylum in France which cannot supply a human tea-pot. Our gentleman was a Britannia-ware tea-pot and was careful to polish himself each morning with buckskin and whiting." "And then," said a cadaverous looking personage, near the foot of the table, taking up the thread of the conversation ... "we had a patient, once upon a time, who very pertenaciously maintained himself to be a Cordova cheese, and went about, with a knife in his hand, soliciting his friends to try a small slice from the middle of his leg." "And then there was an ignoramus," said he, "who mistook himself for a frog... Sir, if that man was not a frog, I can only observe that it was a pity he was not. His croak thus—o-o-o-o-gh—o-o-o-o-gh! was the finest note in the world—B flat; and when he put his elbows on the table thus—after taking a glass or two of wine—and distended his mouth, anticipates them, but is conscious of his disjunction and sees getting away from society (land) as an entering into community and compact (the sea voyage), with the relation ship to the whale as one involving sustenance in a total sense, even extending to the enterprise itself which links all of them together. But... so much for nineteenth century psychology, an exception to my general point here. ir'Again, we are reminded of contemporary fabulists such as Pyncheon. When a story is simultaneously true in form—a perfect logical structure—and false in its original validity (premise) and external function, it represents that very operative excess of which comedy is made.</page><page sequence="27">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 27 thus, and rolled up his eyes, thus, and winked them with excessive rapidity, thus, why then, sir, I take it upon myself to say, positively, that you would have been lost in admiration of the genius of the man." "And then," said somebody else, "then there was Petit Gaillard, who thought himself a pinch of snuff and was truly distressed because he could not take himself between his own finger and thumb." "... Jules Desoulières ... went mad with the idea that he was a pump kin. He persecuted the cook to make him up into pies—a thing which the cook indignantly refused to do. For my part, I am by no means sure that a pumpkin pie à la Desoulières would not have been very capital eating indeed!" "... then there was Bouffon Le Grand—another extraordinary personage in his way. He grew deranged through love, and fancied himself possessed of two heads. One of these he maintained to be the head of Cicero; the other he imagined a composite one, being Demosthenes from the top of the head to the mouth, and Lord Brougham's from the mouth to the chin. It is not impossible that he was wrong, but he would have convinced you of his being in the right; for he was a man of great eloquence. He had an absolute passion for oratory, and could not refrain from display. For example, he used to leap upon the dinner-table thus, and—and—" "Oh, Madame Joyeuse [who had thought herself turned into a chicken cock and crowed deliciously] was a fool!" she exclaimed, "but there was really much sound sense, after all, in the opinion of Eugenie Salsafette. She was a very beautiful and painfully modest young lady, who thought the ordinary mode of habiliment indecent, and wished to dress herself, always, by getting outside instead of inside her clothes. It is a thing very easily done, after all. You have only to do so—and then so—so—so— and then so—so—so—and then—." An antic imagination of this kind certainly is not totally absent from Poe's other writings. While a story such as "The Cask of Amontillado" has an obvious humor of the grotesque incorporated into it, it in no way diminishes such seriously-viewed tales as "The Fall of the House of Usher," or "Ligeia" or "The Masque of the Red Death" to look at them as comedies of a special sort—the lyric grotesque, relished for the very delight that horror gives us when presented through a certain slant of view. In fact, it is easier to accept that as probability than to believe that Poe was submerged in the ingenuousness that a strictly serious reading of the tales would presume. We can feel virtuous at enjoying a story because it has a solemn moral point to it, such as "The Red Death," but we may be forcing obtuseness upon ourselves if that is all that we will allow ourselves to see. Melville, on the other hand, had a clearly defined line of humor in just about all of his work that makes a story such as "Bartleby the Scrivener" simultaneously hilarious and chilling. Characters named Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut come on stage with a comic definition already established for them. There is a complex, even surrealist perception underlying the story "Cock-a-Doodle—Doo! Or the Crowing of the Noble Cock Benventano" (1853) which links it with the best of Poe's stories as what is sometimes called the adult fairy tale, while stories like "Benito Cereno," "The Tartarus</page><page sequence="28">28 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? of Maids," and even "Billy Budd" remain elusive to the determinedly logical interpretations placed upon them. Moby Dick, itself, is one of the greatest of all comic achievements in the novel genre. Doubtlessly Melville smiled with satisfaction at the excess energy of Ahab as he created him (In a letter to Hawthorne, he reported having just completed "a very wicked book" and said that, as a consequence, he felt as clean as a lamb!); the devil incarnate is a figure who sets our blood coursing with the pleasure of excite ment. For excitement, to be sure, is the entertainment or amusement of the emotions, as the greatest of artists from Shakespeare and Beethoven on have shown us. On a more orthodox level of humor, however, consider this passage from Moby Dick; high comedy though it is, it nonetheless clearly ties the whale hunt to the fertility myth common to all cultures of mankind, showing leviathan as the visible body of the universe, upon which men feed and through the enduring life of which they propagate and perpetuate themselves, laboring and laughing simultaneously. Look at the sailor called the mincer, who now comes along, and assisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus [the whale's penis], as the mariners call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as almost to double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down, when removing some three feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it. The mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to all his order, this investiture alone will adequately protect him, while employed in the peculiar functions of his office. ... Arrayed in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves [thin sheets of blubber]; what a candidate for an archbishoprick, what a lad for a Pope were this mincer! ("The Cassock," Moby Dick) Was ever work and sex more convincingly, more intrinsically, and more delightedly tied together? As satirical comment, humor plays a weightier role, at times, much as it does, say, in the Fool's bitter jests about Lear's situation. Hawthorne, in that brooding over-view so characteristic of his novels, sometimes steps on stage and describes the skeletal grin quite clearly to us. In The House of the Seven Gables, the set-piece (a still life, in the literal sense!) of Judge Pyn cheon, alone in the house after Death unexpectedly presents its bill to him, is rendered superbly, even if rather obviously. Irony rules the universe. However, out of that skeptical view, a positive one: Life is simultaneously seen as precious and as too precious to be so grossly pursued as gain; its very seriousness means that we are wasting it if we take it too seriously, if each moment we do not enjoy it solely for its own sake. A carpe diem note, to be sure, but close, too, to a medieval memento mori for the reader.</page><page sequence="29">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and. Warmth of Wiser Men? 29 Pray, pray, Judge Pyncheon, look at your watch, now! what—not a glance? It is within ten minutes of the dinner-hour! It surely cannot have slipped your memory that the dinner of today is to be the most important, in its consequences, of all the dinners you ever ate.... Start up, then, and hurrying through the streets burst in upon the company that they may begin before the fish is spoiled. They wait for you; and it is little for your interest that they should wait.... They are practiced politicians, every man of them, and skilled to adjust those preliminary measures which steal from the people, without its knowledge, the power of choosing its own rulers.... They meet to decide upon their candidate.... And what worthier candidate,—more wise and learned, more noted for philanthropic liberality, truer to safe principles ... so combining all these claims to the chief rulership as Judge Pyn cheon here before us? Make haste, then! Do your part! The need for which you have toiled, and fought, and climbed, and crept is ready for your grasp. Be present for this dinner!—drink a glass or two of that noble wine!—make your pledges in as low a whisper as you will!—and you rise up from table virtually governor of the glorious old State! Governor Pyncheon of Massachusetts! Well, it is absolutely too late for dinner! Turtle, salmon, tautog, woodcock, boiled turkey, South-Down mutton, pig, roastbeef, have vanished, or exist only in fragments, with lukewarm potatoes, and gravies crusted over with cold fat. The Judge, had he done nothing else, would have achieved wonders with his knife and fork. It was he, you know, of whom it used to be said, in reference to his ogre-like ap petite, that his Creator made him a great animal, but that the dinner hour made him a great beast.... But, for once, the Judge is entirely too late for dinner! Too late, we fear, even to join the party at their wine!... Neither would it be seemly in Judge Pyncheon, generally so scrupulous in his attire, to show himself at a dinner table with that crimson stain upon his shirt-bosom. By the by, how came it there? It is an ugly sight, at any rate; and the wisest way for the Judge is to button his coat closely over his breast, and... to make all speed to his own house. There, after a glass of brandy and water, and... some such hasty little dinner and supper all in one, he had better spend the evening by the fireside. He must toast his slippers a long while, in order to get rid of the chilliness which the air of this vile old house has sent curdling through his veins. Up, therefore, Judge Pyncheon, up! ("Governor Pyncheon," The House of The Seven Gables) Not a very nice way to talk to a corpse, obviously. If a dancing skeleton is funny in a purposeful way, on the other hand, so, too, is a corpulent corpse, who is missing the first of all the infinite number of dinners he will never again eat. (Even the word corpulent becomes doubly ironic; how easily Judge Pyncheon will lose weight in the days ahead!) Vanitas vanitatuml The mockery of life by death—and vice versa. Although the statement as such, here, is obviously different, we are fairly close to the same effect on us that Dickens accomplished in his railroad epiphany, as well as in the death of Carker. The sophisticated literature of America is not, of course, where readers generally first think to look for humor. Traditionally, it is in the folk culture,</page><page sequence="30">30 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? the legends, and myths, and public events of a people that in the nineteenth century saw themselves as vigorous and youthful, moving the front yards and Main Street of the nation further west each year. "The youth of Amer ica," observed Oscar Wilde, at a time when Victoria still reigned, "is their oldest tradition; it has been going on now for three hundred years." Of course, some of what was called American folk humor was quite sophisticated wit; Twain himself could fetch up a line worthy of Wilde or Shaw, such as the following thrust of musical criticism: "Wagner's music is better than it sounds." However, tales of youth, of growing up, of lower-class figures on the make (what today we solemnly call "upward mobility"); the adolescent wit and escapades of a society proud of being unencumbered by tradition and so falling into the simplest and most clear-cut of traditions: this is the popular humor of the nineteenth century in America. Eighteenth century America had been, still, an immigrant English culture, drawing from a familiar and rich fund of community identity that had been transplanted from Old to New England with little loss. But the bondsmen, Scotch-Irish immigrants, and various drifters who moved inland in search of a farm in the mountains of Kentucky and Tennessee and West Virginia, and whose children later moved out ahead of the developing communities of the middle-western states, had as library only an oral tradition. With the clan pride of the rural illiterate, they disparaged strangers, distrusted all who spoke differently, and brought to humor a value system based on physical prowess harmonious with their life activities, simple cunning, and indifference or hostility to subtleties and abstractions. For literate America, as for England, then, the frontier becomes an arena of humor in which special kinds of creatures could be observed—the arrogant lout, the confidence man, the simple and uncritical soul, the anonymous good folk. Beginning at the time of the American Revolution and coming down through William Faulkner in our own time, frontier humor has seemed uniquely American, perhaps because it was one of the rare modern situations in which the process of settlement took place over centuries, allowing succes sive generations to lose earlier cultural characteristics of a more sophisticated sort before going into a still more primitive situation. The nineteenth century writers of such humor were, obviously, comparative sophisticates in their own communities: lawyers and journalists whose writings as often as not carry an amiable and tolerant contempt for the rubes and sharpers that they describe. A glance through the periodicals of the nineteenth century might well give the impression that everyone in the established cities, particularly in the northeast, spent much of their time chuckling at rural folk. One of the other stereotypes is the comic immigrant; it begins early, and the archetypes of each national identity were firmly stamped in the humor ous literature. Imitative in form and sometimes scurrilous though a work like Modern Chivalry was, Hugh Henry Brackenridge created figures recognizable to his readers in his Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, here known as Captain Farrago and his Irish servant, Teague O'Regan. In contrast to Cervantes' original, however, it is Teague, despite his craftiness, who ends up in most of the scrapes. Considering the respect for the press that we have in the late twentieth century, it is surprising to see how often nineteenth century</page><page sequence="31">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 31 writers assault what they consider to be the self-serving and vicious press of their day; in Modern Chivalry II (1804), Captain Farrago speaks to a group of men who wish to set up a press to rival the local one and need a figure-head editor to run it. Ethnic humor that we would publicly wince at today, the following passage sketches the stage Irishman in clear detail. "The very Teague O'Regan that you want is at hand, a waiter of mine. A bog-trotter, taken, not on the Balagate, but, on the Irish moun tains: an aboriginal of the island; not your scotch-Irish, so called, a colony planted in Ulster by King James the first of England when he subdued the natives; but a real Paddy, with the brogue on his tongue, and none on his feet; brought up to sheep-stealing from his youth; for his ancestors inhabiting the hills, were a kind of freebooters, time im memorial, coming down to the low grounds, and plundering the more industrious inhabitants. Captured by traps set upon the hills, or sur rounded in the bogs, attempting his escape, he had been tamed and employed, many years, digging Turf, before he came to my hands. I brought him from an Irish vessel just as a curiosity, not that I expected much service from him; but to see what could be made of a rude man by care and patience. The rogue has a low humor, and a sharp tongue; unbounded impudence. And what may be a restraint upon the licentiousness of his press, should he set up one, he is a most abominable coward; the idea of cudgeling will keep him in bounds, should he... turn on his employers. He has all the low phrases, cant expressions, illiberal reflections, that could be collected from the company he has kept since he has had the care of my horse, and run after my heels in town and country for several years past. What is more, he has been in France, and has a spice of the language, and a tang of Jacobism in his principles, and conversation.... I do not know that you can do better than contribute to a paper of his setting up. He may call it the Mully-Grub or give it some such title as will speak the nature, of the matter it will usually contain." Such was the comic view, almost a hundred and eighty years ago, of the profession of journalism, and a suitable candidate for the position of editor of a newspaper. Needless to say, Don Quixote never spoke of his faithful Sancho, however bothersome, in such a way. The setting of Modern Chivalry was rural Pennsylvania, the hill country that was a world away from Philadelphia. As much as anything, it is a critical view of random democracy in the boondocks of post-Colonial Amer ica. The true frontier humorists came somewhat later. Augustus B. Longstreet in his Georgia Scenes (1835) made much use of vernacular speech, the portrayal of folk manners and mores, and the temperament of an essentially undisciplined and strongly egalitarian pro tagonist. "The Horse-Swap," for instance, has as its main point the comically viewed, even if rueful truth, that all men are knaves. The character who identifies himself as the "Yallow Blossom from Jasper" (identities, typically, are flexible in frontier humor; as part of the egalitarian mode, people create themselves) has as his aim the foisting off of a horse with an incurable ulcer hidden under the saddle blanket. He ends up with a deaf-and-blind horse in exchange, foisted off on him by an old man and a boy. The story</page><page sequence="32">32 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? provides us with an elaborate protocol on the ritual of cheating, an action which is assumed to be the aim of both sides; the real contest is to see if both can pull it off, and then to see which has come out as most successful in the two-sided confidence game. The cheaters cheated, or as the Eliza bethans would have said, the connycatcher caught. Yet, rough though it is, there is a certain justice about it, a fitness in things, a lynch-law of folk humor that is basic to the tradition. "Come-uppance" is the element of satis faction in many of these tales. Some Adventures of Captain Simon Suggs (1845), by Johnson J. Hooper, introduced an Alabama con artist who had the cunning of a packrat and no inhibiting scruples whatsoever. Like Longstreet, Hooper was a small-town professional man, one of those citizens who took a keen interest in defining the character of their community as it began to shape itself. All of the occasions for getting together—trade, sport, religion, birth, marriage, and dying—were ripe with jest, if one had the eye to see it. For instance, Simon Suggs is only one of many in the long line of shouting penitents who used the fundamentalist religion of the rural south as a means of milking his fellow man. In the Camp-Meeting episode of Hooper's book, Suggs deliberate ly undergoes "conversion," takes up a collection to start his own church and lights out with his loot, leaving his victims gullibly awaiting his return. The humor, as always in this sort of tale, is in the incidental description as much as in the central action. "Bless my poor old soul!" screamed the preacher in the pulpit; "ef yonder aint a squad in that corner that we aint got one outen yet! It'll never do"—raising his voice—"you must come outen that! Brother Fant, fetch up that youngster in the blue coat! I see the Lord's a working upon him! Fetch him along—glory—yes!—hold to him!" "Keep the thing warm!" roared a sensual seeming man, of stout mold and florid countenance, who was exhorting among a bevy of young women, upon whom he was lavishing caresses. "Keep the thing warm, breethring!—come to the Lord, honey!" he added, as he vigorously hugged one of the damsels he sought to save. "Oh, I've got him!" said another man in exulting tones, as he led up a gawky youth among the mourners—"I've got him—he tried to git off, but—ha! Lord!"—shaking his head as to say, it took a smart fellow to escape him—"ha! Lord!—and he wiped the perspiration from his face with one hand, and with the other, patted his neophyte on the shoulder—" he couldn't do it! No! Then he tried to argy wi' me—but bless the Lord!—he couldn't do that nother! Ha! Lord! I tuk him, first in the Old Testament—bless the Lord—and I argyed him all the Kings—then I throwd him into Proverbs—and from that, here we had it up and down, kleer down to the New Testament, and then I begun to see it work him!—then we got into Matthy, and from Matthy right straight along to Acts; and thar I throwed him! Y-e-s—L-o-r-d!".... "Gl-o-ree!" yelled a huge greasy negro woman, as in a fit of the jerks, she threw herself convulsively from her feet, and fell "like a thousand of brick" across a diminutive old man in a little round hat, who was squeaking consolation to one of the mourners. "God Lord, have mercy!" ejaculated the little man earnestly and</page><page sequence="33">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 33 unaffectedly, as he strove to crawl from under the sable mass that was crushing him. The swirling panorama of life in the public square is what emerges from such scenes, the delight that we get in witnessing human emotion literally running riot in the fulfillment of what at times looks suspiciously like a mad idea. Not simply the individual but mankind itself is devoted to the celebra tion of folly here. It is a scene in which Elmer Gantry is born, long before Sinclair Lewis himself, along with a host of hot preachers and mesmerized converts, characters who return in the novels of Erskine Caldwell and other twentieth century writers about the rural proletariat. By contemporary—or even modern—standards, the frontier humorists were realists in almost every way that their exaggeration could accommodate. George Washington Harris, whose "Sut Lovingood" vies with Hooper's Simon Suggs as among the most pungent and vital of nineteenth century folk-fictional characters, used Chaucerian cuckoldry as the basis for one of his best tales, "Rare Ripe Garden Seed." In the story, Wat (a Chaucerian name, even if by coincidence) comes home after four and a half months of marriage, the last few weeks of which he has been away, to discover his wife delivered of a new daughter: —a par ove littil rat-eyes a-shining abuv the aind ove the quilt, ontu Mary's arm... a-turnin intu two hundred thousand big green stars, an' a-swingin roun an' roun the room, faster an' faster, ontil they mix'd intu one orful green flash. He drap't intu a limber pile on the floor. (Some contemporary readers, needless to say, already find the dialect as difficult to read as Chaucer's Middle English.) When the protagonist recovers consciousness, the mother-in-law seeks to convince him that a rare ripe seed that he had brought of a peddler earlier, which yields, allegedly, twice as much corn, taters, or peas, has worked in the case of his wife, also. As the old bawd puts it: "Everything cums in adzackly half the time that hit takes the old sort, an' yu knows, my darlin son, yu planted hit waseful. I tho't then yu'd rar ripe everything on the place. You planted often, too didn't yu, luv? fur fear hit wudn't cum up." "Ye-ye-s-s he-he did," sed Mary a-cryin. Wat studied pow'ful deep a spell, an' the widder jis waited. Widders allers wait an allers win. She does her gleeful, insidious best to convince Wat that the child is his, and the case she presents is one of uproariously comic effect. However, in true Chaucerian pattern, Wat remains unconvinced but bides his time, waiting for vengeance against Dolton, the sheriff, who has planted old-fashioned, full term seed. Religion, swindling, sex, great lies generally—such are the constituents of the folk tradition. The Camp Meeting of Simon Suggs, and the Horse Swap, are only a few of the many tales that in transformation emerged into world literature through such books as Life on the Mississippi and Huck Finn. The most celebrated mid-twentieth century novelist in America, William</page><page sequence="34">34 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? Faulkner, borrowed heavily from the tradition, which should serve to remind us that the comic element may well be the strongest single thread in his work. His great long tale, or novelette, The Bear, certainly is a lineal de scendant of T. B. Thorpe's account of the mythical—and nearly mystical— beast, "The Big Bear of Arkansas."16 While, as readers, we pay homage to writers for their originality, after thousands of years we still have not realized that the originality rarely consists of the story, itself, that art consists of what you do with what you find. The great master of folk humor in a polished form was, of course, Twain, himself. His work is so well known that it needs no sampling for content; however, his skillful use of exaggeration is worth at least a single illustration. A section from "The Blue-Jay Yarn" in A Tramp Abroad is pure humor of delight: There's more to a blue-jay than any other creature. He has got more moods, and more different kinds of feelings than other creatures; and mind you, whatever a blue-jay feels, he can put into language. And no mere commonplace language, either, but rattling, out-and-out book talk—and bristling with metaphor, too—just bristling! And as for com mand of language—why you never see a blue-jay get stuck for a word. No man ever did. They just boil out of him! And another thing: I've noticed a good deal, and there's no bird, or cow, or anything that uses as good grammar as a blue-jay. You may say a cat uses good grammar. Well, a cat does—but you let a cat get excited, once; you let a cat get to pulling fur with another cat on a shed, nights, and you'll hear gram mar that will give you the lockjaw. Ignorant people think it's the noise which fighting cats make that is so aggravating, but it ain't so; it's the sickening grammar they use. Now, I've never heard a jay use bad grammar but very seldom; and when they do, they are as ashamed as a human; they shut right down and leave. It is immediately apparent that Mark Twain offers here no such direct anthropomorphism as does Joel Chandler Harris in his Uncle Remus tales. The true characters of the blue-jays and the cats are an essential part of the humorous description given; the choice of grammar as a definitive quality 16As a nineteenth century tall tale, "The Big Bear" is unusual in the visible somber note that parallels the humor: "Stranger, it took five niggers and myself to put that carcase on a mule's back and old long-ears waddled under the load, as if he was founder ed in every leg of his body, and with a common whopper of a bar, he would have trotted off, and enjoyed himself. 'Twould astonish you to know how big he was It was in fact a creation bar, and if it had lived in Samson's time, and had met him, in a fair fight, it would have licked him in the twinkling of a dice box. But, stranger, I never liked the way I hunted, and missed him. There is something curious about it, I could never understand—and I never was satisfied at his giving in so easy at last. Perhaps, he had heard of my preparations to hunt him the next day, so he jist come in, like Capt. Scott's coon, to save his wind to grunt with in dying; but that ain't likely. My private opinion is, that that bar was an unhuntable bar, and died when his time come. "When the story was ended, our hero sat some minutes with his auditors in a grave silence; I saw there was a mystery to him connected with the bear whose death he had just related, that had evidently made a strong impression on his mind. It was also evident that there was some superstitious awe connected with the affair—a feeling common with all 'children of the woods,' when they meet with anything out of their everyday experi ence," in The Spirit of the Times, XI (March 27, 1841 ).</page><page sequence="35">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 35 suits perfectly the vocal nature of the creatures. There's a point, though one hopes that it is not taken too seriously; at bottom the piece is probably most effective as nonsense. But the charge with which the nonsense is exploded is, in fact, an intellectual perception of sorts that we enjoy solely as it is hap pening. It delights us by its conceptual dexterity, its ingenuity, rather than as the moral education of satire or as the mindless belly laugh that comes from simple situation comedy. As the blue-jay excerpt illustrates, one of the characteristics of frontier humor that Twain largely—though not wholly—avoids in his writing is the use of strong dialect translated into phonetic spelling. This technique is tied to a potentially oral delivery, of course. Nineteenth century America ap parently loved to make, and listen to, speeches. Self-conscious democracy verifies itself, over and over, through assemblies; an extended form of that device is the popular newspaper. This institution spawned another major group of American humorists in the first full century of the new nation— the newspaper columnist as literary comedian. (The instinct itself was not new; the first periodicals, at the beginning of the eighteenth century in England, had devoted a good bit of their space to humorous evaluations of country life and types of character; the de Coverley Papers, in The Spectator, lead, through "Jorrocks' Jaunts and Jollities," straight down to The Posthu mous Papers of the Pickwick Club). Of particular interest here is that the writer himself became the comic personality, rather than any one character in his writing; he engaged in role playing, and continued his comic identity outside the pages of the newspaper in a career of lecturing, and comic entertainment, generally. In other words, he embodied his own humor. The name of these newspaper humorists is legion, although most are forgotten in the individual sense today, for the very techniques of their brand of folk realism —such as phonetic spelling—which linked them very closely to their time separates them from ours. Some of them had a fine sense of wit and paradox, and it is a shame that their concepts were so undercut by non enduring modes of presentation. Consider, for example, a few lines from Josh Billings' "Essa on the Muel": The muel iz haf hoss and haf Jackass, and then cums tu a full stop, natur diskovering her mistake. Tha weigh more, akordin tu their heft, than enny other kreetur, except a crowbar. Tha sel for more money than anny other domestik animile. You kant tell their age by looking into their mouth, enny more than you kould a Mexican kannons. Tha never hav no dissease that a good club wont heal. If tha ever die tha must kum rite tu life again, for i never herd nobuddy sa "ded muel." Tha are the strongest creeturs on earth, and heaviest akording tu their size; I herd tell ov one who felld oph from the tow path, on the Eri kanawl, and sunk as soon as he touched bottom, but he kept rite on towing the boat tu the nex stashun, breathing thru his ears, which stuck out ov the water about 2 feet 6 inches; i didn't see this did, but an auctioneer told me ov it, and i never knew an auctioneer tu lie unless it was absolutely convenient. ( Josh Billings, His Sayings. 1865)</page><page sequence="36">36 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? Inconsistency certainly is a characteristic of the illiterate, but it is more difficult to carry off in art. In the above passage, for example, it may be literally possible that the writer would spell the word "kreetur" one time and "creetur" the next. However, it is far less convincing to see Mexican capitalized (and properly spelled, instead of "mecksakun") while "i" is given in an improbable lower case; or to see why "they sell" comes out as "tha sel" when the slightly more complex "more money" is not "mor muni (or -ee)." The relationship of the newspaper humorists to frontier humor is obvious, although the journalists took a class, rather than a strictly regional, approach, and defined ordinary American life all across the land. "John Phoenix" (George Horatio Darby), born in Massachusetts in 1823, did much of his writing in California, where he mocked the cultural pretensions of the far West in a way anticipatory of H. L. Mencken almost a century later. "Josh Billings," himself (Henry Wheeler Shaw), who was also born in Mas sachusetts, settled finally in New York where for several years he wrote and published The Farmers' Allminax, obviously no more a practising farmer than Walt Whitman. Eleven volumes of his work—all essays and aphorisms—appeared over the years. "Artemus Ward" (Charles Farrar Browne) was another New Englander, born in Maine in 1834. Going to Cleveland where he became Editor of The Plain Dealer, he began writing "Artemus Ward's Sayings," the fictional experiences of an itinerant showman. Extremely successful, he took up comic lecturing, attracting vast audiences, and was, in fact, more or less the sponsor of both Josh Billings and Mark Twain in their early publishing attempts. His "Among the Free Lovers" is still an amusing piece, and an interesting comparison to Simon Suggs at the Camp Meeting. Artemus has pitched his tents in "Berlin Hites, Ohio," which he learns is currently occupied by "an extensive seek called Free Lovers, who be lieved in affinertys and sich, goin back on their domestic ties without no hesitation whatsomever. They was likewise spirit rappers and high presher reformers on general principle." The description that follows, phonetic spell ing aside, suggests very much an encounter with a commune of late-1960s flower children, an experience by no means congenial to the conservative showman, particularly when one of the females proclaims him as her spiritual-physical "affinity"—i.e. soul-mate, but with bed duties required. An ornrear set I have never sawn. The men's faces was all covered with hare and they lookt half-starved to deth. They didn't wear no weskuts for the purpuss (as they sed) of allowin the free air of hevun to blow onto their boozums.... Presently a perfekly orful lookin female presented herself at the door.

"Yes," I anserd, "you have found me at larst, and you would have found me at fust, if you had come sooner." She grabd me vilently by the coat collar, and brandishin her um breller wildly round exclaimed: "Air you a man?"</page><page sequence="37">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 37 Sez I, "I think I air, but if you doubt it, you can address Mrs. A. Ward, Baldinsville, Injianny, postage pade, and she will probly giv you the desired informashun." "Then thou ist what the cold world calls marrid?" "Madam, I istest!" The exsentric female then clutched me franticly by the arm and hollerd: "You air mine, O you air mine!" "Scacely," I sed, endeverin to git loose from her. But she clung to me and sed: "You air my Affinerty!" "What upon arth is that?" I shouted. "Dost thou not know?" "No, I dostent!" "Listen man &amp; I'll tell ye," sed the strange female; "for years I hav yearned for thee. I knowd thou wast in the world, sumwhares, tho I didn't know whare. My hart sed he would cum and I took courage. He has cum—he's here—you air him—you air my Affinerty! O 'tis too mutch! too mutch!" and she sobbed again. "Yes," I anserd, "I think it is a darn site too mutch!" "Hast thou not yearned for me?" she yelled, ringin her hands like a female play acter. "Not a yearn!" I bellerd at the top of my voice, throwin her away from me. (Artemus Ward: His Book, 1862) Born, generally, in small-town newspapers, the humorous journalist did give some regional definition, although it was not so great as it looked at the time. Artemus Ward was as suitable for an audience in Utica as in a small town in Indiana. Nonetheless, such writers engendered both local identity and local loyalty. Frances Miriam Whitcher, first appearing in a Rome, New York, newspaper was an acute observer of folk mannerisms in the small towns of central New York; her Widow Bedott Papers, re published in book form in 1856, was subsequently dramatized successfully by David Ross Locke ("Petroleum V. Nasby") and has been seen as a model for some of the more serious regional fiction at the turn of the cen tury.17 Although there is no necessary tie, the monologues of the loquacious Widow have certain characteristics in common with Douglas Jerrold's "Mrs. Caudle's Curtain Lectures" that appeared in Punch the year before the Widow began talking (1846). Among others, James Montgomery Bailey, widely known throughout Connecticut and southern New England generally as "The Danbury News Man," for the local paper he edited, wrote droll accounts of life in the community, which later was captured in more abstract fashion by the composer Charles Ives. (Son of the Danbury Band master, Ives deliberately transposed elements of New England folk humor into his New England place sketches and other musical profiles). At the end of the century, the humorous journalist emerges most clearly as political commentator and reformer, a partner of the muckraker and cartoonist. Finley Peter Dunne was a characteristic nineteenth century writer 17See Brom Weber's account of Mrs. Whicher in An Anthology of American Humor (New York, 1962), p. 242.</page><page sequence="38">38 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? in his use of folk dialect. However, in his writings the speech pattern was an urban rather than a rural one—the monologues of a Chicago Irishman, "Mr. Dooley." The most effective of the pieces, such as the one on the annexation of the Philippines at the time of the Spanish-American War, gave Dunne the critical clout of political cartoonists such as Thomas Nast; the better part of a century later, the monologue would still be an effective comment on recent American foreign policy in Asia. "Naygurs," we say, "poor, dissolute, uncovered wretches," says we, "whin the crool hand iv Spain forged manacles fr ye'er limbs, as Hogan says, who was it crossed th' say an' shtruck off th' comealongs? We did,—by dad, we did. An' now, ye mis'rable, childish-minded apes, we propose f'r to Iarn ye the uses iv liberty.

"We thank ye kindly; but we believe," he says, "in patronizing" home industhries," he says. "An'," he says, "I have on hand," he says, "an fr sale," he says, "a very superyor brand iv home-made liberty, like ye'er mother used to make," he says.... "I can't give up," he says, "th' rights f'r which f'r five years I've fought an' bled ivry wan I cud reach," he says. "Onless," he says, "ye'd feel like buyin' out the whole business," he says. "I'm a pathrite," he says; "but I'm no bigot," he says. (Mr. Dooley in the Hearts of His Countrymen, 1899) There is, undoubtedly, a gap between certain of the more successful humorous writings of the nineteenth century and our capacity for apprecia tion. Those pieces that depend most for effect on the manners of a given era, for instance, the continuous flood of cartoons with gag captions done by what undoubtedly would have been great comic artists in any century—from George Cruikshank down to Phil May—probably speak to us chiefly as curiosity, or period, pieces. External appearance and manners are separate for different generations far more than ideas per se are; today we are probably closer to Byron's mind than we are to that of the illustrator Charles Keene, despite his popularity in a wide-circulation magazine such as Punch. Nonetheless, it must be admitted that the old-fashioned or quaint has a special quality of humor about it; we smile when we look at adver tisements from Harrod's or Sears Roebuck from the 'Nineties, and the smile is not really one of superiority so much as pleasure; i.e. delight, warmth. Then, too, despite recent critical interest, some of the nonsense writings of the Victorians no longer seem to speak to us very effectively. That</page><page sequence="39">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 39 inconsequential trivia that works well as pointed nonsense for one generation does not work quite so well for another. Although the form of Edward Lear's limericks remains fresh and has evoked literally millions of imitations, written and unwritten, on paper, or lavatory walls, the content of the originals seems less absurd and more flat than it must once have appeared: There was an Old Man of Cape Horn Who wished he had never been born; So he sat on a chair, till he died of despair, That dolorous Man of Cape Horn. Even if more effective with the illustration, the poem is scarcely worth a chuckle today. In contrast, "Lewis Carroll" and W. S. Gilbert both seem to have created an absurd tradition to which we still find ourselves responding happily. There is nothing lost from this morsel of the famous Tea Party after 111 years: The Hatter was the first to break the silence. "What day of the month is it?" he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear. Alice considered a little, and then said "The fourth." "Two days wrong!" sighed the Hatter. "I told you butter wouldn't suit the works!" he added, looking angrily at the March Hare. "It was the best butter," the March Hare meekly replied. "Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well," the Hatter grumbled: "you shouldn't have put it in with the breadknife." The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, "It was the best butter, you know." (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Chapter VII, 1865) The rhythm of "Gilbert &amp; Sullivan" is unique in the world, and derives from the words of the poetry even more than from the music of Sir Arthur Sullivan. An essential ingredient in the humor of delight (which here fuses with the humor of comedy in the meaning of the words as absurd ideas), the patter in fact forces its own music into existence: If you're anxious for to shine in the high aesthetic line as a man of culture rare, You must get up all the germs of the transcendental terms, and plant them everywhere. You must lie upon the daisies and discourse in novel phrases of your complicated state of mind, The meaning doesn't matter if it's only idle chatter of a transcendental kind. And every one will say, As you walk your mystic way, "If this young man expresses himself in terms too deep for me, Why, what a very singularly deep young man this deep young man must be!" (Act I, Patience or Bunthorne's Bride, 1881 )</page><page sequence="40">40 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? It is not only a masterpiece of quantitative verse; as the above selection shows, even though written for oral delivery, as song, it is structured with the precision of a Metaphysical sight-poem. If as earlier discussed, there are adult fairy tales, Gilbert's poems are adult nursery rimes, skewering pre tentiousness but with a rhythmic pattern as basic—and compulsive—as the first chants of childhood. There remains, however, the fact that in many ways we have moved past nineteenth century consciousness; and in at least some of these ways, beyond return. The uncouth Jorrocks, the grocer playing the country sporting aristo crat ("No man is fit to be called a sportsman wot doesn't kick his wife out of bed on a haverage once in three weeks!"), the satirizing of the Irish character in Cruikshank's series of representative Hibernians or in Bracken ridge's Teague O'Reagan, the blubber-lipped, saucer-eyed negro entertainers from a bamboo isle in the cartoons of an emerging cafe society towards the end of the century—all down through the 1800s, all of that rich visual humor of a Surtees or Dickens novel, illustrations by the Cruikshanks, "Phiz," Thackeray, Tenniel, John Leech, George du Maurier, and Keene, all built on a community of popular belief that in its detail is largely gone from our lives. And humor, in large measure, does depend on specific detail, made more intense even than the reality—in the gentlest humor there is at least a tint, a faint shadow, of caricature. Were it appearing for the first time today and without the legitimizing cover of historical value, we would probably be embarrassed to see much nineteenth century humor. Yet, under that cover we can laugh, even though today we excise violence from fairy tales (and determinedly include, in children's literature now being written, social problems such as divorce). Today one does not, as the Victorians did, publicly mock national origins, race, the lower classes, non-Christian religions, for we are too tolerant to allow it. Morality will save us socially, even if we've given up on it spiritually. (Are we today more hostile towards outside groupings that once were too vague or impersonal to concentrate upon—business men, political leaders, all of the embodiments of that arch-sinner, "society" the guilt of which as an institution frees us, individually? To be sure, in humor we do offer self deprecation on small points, though frequently as a tacit claim for sympathetic reparations as a victim. Always admit a minor fault before people get around to assigning you a great one: it's social inoculation). I do not mean to dismiss the idea behind these changes in social morality in cavalier fashion. If we wished, we could not get rid of our knowledge of our own recent past—for example, the history of labor movements in the early twentieth century—of which the Victorians were to be forever innocent. While sometimes merely part of public conformity to a prevailing moral attitude, the passing of a given subject from moral acceptability in humor frequently is genuine and very often is a clear social gain—for instance, the diminishing tolerance of ethnic slurs as jokes. However, perhaps equally instructive is the kind of subject matter that remains humorous. In the last part of the twentieth century, jokes about drunks remain as common as ever, undoubtedly more acceptable to a middle-class audience than they were in the nineteenth century. On the other hand, drug-addict jokes remain com pletely unacceptable. It appears that our determination not to take drinking</page><page sequence="41">Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? 41 seriously is reinforced through the device, or control, of humor; so long as we can laugh at a drunk falling downstairs, the subject remains territory outside moral consideration. Looked at from both sides, then, humor is at least an indication of social change. How well have we come along in humor these last several decades? We have brought My Secret Life in from the outhouse, where it was clandestine humor, to the living room where we have re-named it Penthouse and turned it into chitchat. Although with its new name and its place on the coffee table, it is, somehow, nowhere near so funny, it supposedly makes us more virtuous, since we are no longer hypocritical about sex, and happier since we don't have to feel guilt. And the followers of the Austrian alienist have told us all during our own century that guilt alone is evil. Only "society" nowa days is guilty, however; the rest of us have got off scot free. And if all sin has been found to be social, then surely we are fortunate men, cleaner in plumbing, cleaner in our re-arranged soul, sitting far above the Victorians on the ladder of time, rather than simply being later Humpty-Dumptys sitting farther along the wall? And surely along with being cleaner, we are happier? Every generation has its own brutalities and obtuseness, and in the ordi nary sense the men of a hundred years ago can have been no wiser than ourselves. Yet, what the nineteenth century appears to have had to a greater extent than we do is a capacity for accepting a more complex emotional value in their lives. We are an impatient generation, with little tolerance for personal discomfort or pain. If we are unhappy in harness, we get a divorce; we no longer accept as normal a life of manifold shades of relationship. In the name of actually achieving an ideal happiness, we gratify our selfishness promptly. Inevitably, by that means, we become more isolated, more solitary, for society itself no longer is a true larger identity than the individual, with its needs and norms dictating those of the individual. We are happier, we believe, for we know that if we had been in the marital situation of Dickens, or Wilkie Collins, or Thackeray, we would have been very unhappy, indeed. But in a world where functional self-gratification has a very different definition, so does unhappiness. Accustomed to central heating, we would find it extremely inconvenient to feed a stove seven or eight times a day, and distressingly uncomfortable to have bedrooms unheated; most of mankind for virtually all of its history has used only its legs for transportation, but we are genuinely inoperative when our cars fail us. Marriage bonds, the ex tended family unit, acceptance of the crippled and the feeble-minded, domestic familiarity with death and birth, the discipline of childhood—our grandfather's experience of them was different from ours. We have redefined their emotional situations for our own lives with considerable success, excising sentiment, guilt, shame, obligation in any number of ways, a myriad other emotional referents, as completely as possible. We are not, then, as capable of sentiment—at least certain kinds of it—because inevitably the acquisition of personal freedom has been purchased with the giving up of emotional ties. But, our self-respect is still too tied to at least the forms of tradition to allow us to be openly cynical as a normal attitude. As we observed earlier, spurious sentiment is sentimentality—in Wilde's definition, the luxury of an emotion without paying for it. All of which suggests that, perhaps, with the loss of natural sentiment, we have lost at least some of our capacity for</page><page sequence="42">42 Nineteenth Century Literary Humor: The Wit and Warmth of Wiser Men? humor, replacing it with the empty form of sentimentality—which is not the true stuff of humor, at all. We can produce writers of soap operas (and the audience for them) in great numbers, but few new Jane Austens, Dickenses, George Eliots, or even James Joyces—to end up with a great twentieth century comic novelist, who grew up in the last years of the nineteenth. Compared with the Victorians, we certainly believe ourselves to be health ier in mind and body. Perhaps. Probably we are simpler, in that we don't have to go through situations that they did; there may even be some truth in the idea that we are the first generation of life-long children. Children, while they enjoy play, are not complex. They have literal minds, and are distrustful of the unfamiliar; they engage in name-calling as a means of dealing with whatever they don't want to think about. They function on a strict pleasure principle. They are selfish. What hurts is bad; what feels good is good—this last definition is a Hemingway statement. The Victorians were not children. And they were, sometimes, very funny. Perhaps, if we listen carefully, they will whisper some new, because old, bon mot to us. University of Manitoba</page></plain_text>
