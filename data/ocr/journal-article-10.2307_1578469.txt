<plain_text><page sequence="1">GENERAL NOTE Randomness, Rules and Compositional Structure in Design Michael Eckersley minde'R andomness is something 'serious- minded' people seldom seek. It usually crops up as a dis- tracting by-product of a more interesting primary objective. A common tendency in one's ordered daily life, either consciously or unconsciously, is to consider randomly occur- ring phenomena to be merely a waste of time, uninteresting and of no practical value. This conditioned attitude is begin- ning to change in some scientific circles as a result of research that has shown amazing, unexpected and complex forms of order in seemingly random physical phenomena. Such research falls under the general umbrella term of 'chaos', and much is currently being written about it. The point I attempt to establish in this paper is that investigation of the concepts of randomness and complexity is, and has been for some time, the province of the creative artist as well as of the scientist. For the artist is, by virtue of the nature of the discipline itself, intrinsically involved in issues of order, compositional structure and form in all its varieties. Who would not admit to having experienced a certain aesthetic satisfaction in the apparent randomness of cloud formations, the fluttering of leaves in the wind, the arrhyth- mic monotony of raindrops, or even the imprints of scat- tered leaves left behind on a sidewalk after a cold autumn rain?Just as there is in all of us the instinct to organize events and space, there also seems to be a contrary urge to disor- ganize events and spaces that appear to be too rigidly struc- tured or confining. This chaos/order paradox has been, directly and indirectly, the subject of much literature, music and visual art [1]. In nature itself an analogous paradox exists between natural shaping systems embodied in various types of polygons, spheres, helixes, spirals, meanders and branching patterns, and the apparently random and cur- iously fascinating natural events described above. Scientific activity over the last 10 years has focused on such complex phenomena as the long-term behavior of weather, turbulence in fluid and chaotic vibration. Whereas in years past such phenomena would have been rejected as hopelessly complex and consigned to the periphery of sci- entific study, this attitude appears to be changing. Such changes hint of a new validation of other forms of investiga- tion involving chaotic themes and informally structured processes, namely, the work of many creative artists. The fact that chaotic phenomena in nature are inherently interest- ing is not news to them. Many artists (e.g. Marcel Duchamp, Wassily Kandinsky, Jackson Pollock) have based entire car- eers on the pursuit, visualization and understanding of such complex life phenomena. Artists have long been considered to exhibit a high toler- ance for ambiguity and apparent complexity. Frank Bar- ron's [2] psychological research in the 1950s indicated that the creative artist characteristically demonstrates a confi- ? 1990 ISAST Pergamon Press plc. Printed in Great Britain. 0024-094X/90 $3.00+0.00 dence that order lies behind apparent confusion and that more common kinds of order need not be sought at the ex- pense of less obvious kinds of order. The writer Isaac Bash- evis Singer, when asked to com- ment on the messy condition of his study, responded matter-of- factly that chaos is intrinsic to his subject matter; the disorder of his study was simply a reflec- tion of that chaos. The com- poser Antonio Vivaldi, it is said, was inspired to create an entire musical composition from the sequence of notes resulting when his cat leaped unexpect- edly upon a keyboard. Other such examples abound in the literature of the arts and sci- ABSTRACT The paper examines how concepts of randomness and chaos impinge on the creative study and practice of design. A body of original work is document- ed involving the transformation of computer-generated random num- ber streams into visually fascinat- ing and thought-provoking graphical arrays. A simple computer-based method for generating a vast num- ber of unique graphic shapes is described. Also examined is the role of rule development in design and the degree to which even simple rules can dramatically influence the appearance of com- positional structure. ences where happenstance, unpredictability and seeming disorder have spawned original and creative ideas. Admit- tedly, the artist's conception of randomness and the scien- tist's conception of randomness are colored by two different paradigms, but these are not necessarily incompatible. Though it is natural and understandable that human beings find comfort in the basic clarity and dependability of law- governed, deterministic systems, many individuals seem genuinely to prefer the surprising, the unpredictable and the original. RANDOMNESS AND CHAOS Webster's dictionary defines randomness as "lacking a def- inite plan, purpose, or pattern"; "being or relating to a set or to an element of a set each of whose elements has equal probability of occurrence". The classic method of generat- ing a random sequence is to toss a coin repeatedly, tallying the occurrence of heads and tails. However, a more useful conception or definition of randomness is offered by the field of algorithmic information theory [3]. This definition of randomness takes into account only the characteristics of the random sequence itself, rather than the process from which the sequence was generated. Consider the following two sequences, both having 20 symbols and both consisting only of the symbols '0' and '1'.

The sequence could be extended indefinitely according to that rule. But it can also be compressed into a more economical algorithm: PRINT '10' (2 x N) TIMES. Sequence B, in contrast, does not appear to obey any rule and cannot be compressed into a more ec- onomical formula. Therefore, it seems reasonable to infer its randomness. Kuppers summarized the principle of randomness in relation to the incom- pressibility of a sequence. He stated that "a sequence is defined as 'random' when the shortest algorithm needed to generate it contains about as many in- formation units as the sequence itself' [4]. A flurry of writings on compositional order and disorder appeared in the early 1970s in Leonardo. Much of this activity was generated by Entropy and Art by Rudolf Arnheim [5]. Arnheim ar- gued that compositional unity is ideally a bipolar struggle between utter simpli- city and utter chaos. While the treatise met with some criticism for the loose- ness of its arguments and its casual cita- tion of precise scientific terms and con- cepts, its basic premise remains compelling. Further insights into ran- domness and art can be found in two other Leonardo articles, one by Michael Challinor [6] and the other by Fred Whipple [7]. Likewise, random behavior in sys- tems has interested researchers in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemis- try, engineering and meteorology for some time. Their work has revealed the pervasiveness of chaotic phenomena even in the simple systems and has led to new methods for finding hidden or- der within apparent chaos. Pickover [8] describes chaos theory as the study of how complicated, random behavior can arise in systems based on simple rules. Such forms of hidden order have been isolated with the aid of comput- ers; they are called attractors, or strange attractors when the chaotic behavior is bound within certain parameters. (For a popular overview of the topic, see Gleick [9].) The prevailing attitude, however, seems to be that randomness as a phenomenon is only interesting when some form of attractor can be isolated within it. In other words, most chaos researchers do not find true or statistical randomness to be an attrac- tive topic for serious study. But statisti- cally random behavior possesses a com- plex and identifying structural 'imprint' all its own, easily identifiable on a global scale but only truly appre- ciated on a local scale. And it is this imprint that students of compositional design will find of interest. THE STRUCTURAL IMPRINT OF RANDOMNESS My interest in randomness grew out of considerable thought and practice in teaching principles of compositional order elaborated by Wong [ 10], Thom- pson [11] and others and in studying the science of statistics. Through my work on the psychology of problem- solving behaviors in designers, I was introduced to random number tables as a quick means of selecting ran- domized groups for experimental test- ing. From that unlikely process I no- ticed interesting distinctions in the makeup of groups selected randomly and groups organized consciously. This awareness spawned a series of informal experiments in my design classroom. I noticed that design students were typi- cally unable to organize elements ran- domly even when explicitly requested to do so. Their conception of random- ness was something quite different from what randomness actually looked like. To illustrate this point, we trans- lated long streams of random numbers into graphical arrays and simply looked at the results. The issue seemed to boil down to structure-the graphical struc- ture generated by random numbers was completely different from anything my students had seen. It is interesting that this same observation has been made in experimental studies involving persons listening to sequences of random audi- ble tones. The subjects quite often could not distinguish the random se- quence from the nonrandom one [12, 13]. When individuals are confronted with the three different sequences A: HTHTTHHT B: HTHHHHHH C: HTHTHTHT sequence A tends to appear more ran- dom than sequences B and C, because it has an equal ratio of heads and tails, and because it has no easily discernable pattern. Studies shown that most people also equate symmetry and long runs of a single character with order, and high rates of alteration and asym- metry with randomness [14]. In reality, however, statistical randomness often exhibits characteristics of symmetry and nonalternation. In fact, the proba- bility of randomly obtaining the three 76 Eckersley, Randomness, Rules and Compositional Structure in Design</page><page sequence="3">sequences above is exactly the same! In other words, depending on one's rela- tive sophistication with the concept, the actual structure of randomness appears surprisingly nonrandom to people, especially when viewed at a local level. The principle can be simply demon- strated by flipping a coin many times and inserting a motif sequentially into a grid on each occurrence of heads. Figure 1 shows an array of 10,000 ran- dom numbers generated with the use of a computer. Rules of insertion (e.g. motif type, rotation, insertion coordi- nates) were input via a simple program. The ratio of heads to tails in the global array (in this case, composed of about 5,000 comma-like motifs) is approxi- mately one-to-one; the distribution is largely homogeneous or even. How- ever, when areas of the same array are viewed locally (Fig. 2) the distribution is anything but homogeneous. The ran- dom distribution of motifs can be de- scribed as globally stable but locally un- predictable, asymmetrical and visually quite dynamic. The notion of random structure seems at first glance to defy logic. However, randomness can exhi- bit as many distinctive structural im- prints as there are varieties and degrees of randomness, methods of graphical analysis and levels of fineness of analy- sis. bers, (2) a two-dimensional plane and (3) rules for insertion and rotation of a predefined motif. Already the complexity of these ran- dom arrays exceeds (in its own way) that found in the famous tiling patterns of M. C. Escher and Sebastien Truchet [15], where the shape topologies, how- ever intricate (in Escher's case), are nonetheless predictably repetitive. In recent years mathematicians such as Roger Penrose [16] and Robert Am- man have made remarkable discoveries in tiling theory. Tiling theory involves study of the geometry of shapes (e.g. equilateral triangles, squares or hexag- ons) that, when multiplied identically and snugly adjoined, will solidly cover an infinitely large plane. Work by Pen- rose and Amman involves the concept of aperiodic tiling, and the exotic forms of symmetry that can arise from irregu- larly occurring geometric patterns. (For an in-depth discussion of periodic and aperiodic tilings, see Grunbaum and Shepard [17].) The subject of ran- dom graphical arrays presented in this paper differs considerably from the aperiodic tilings of Penrose and others in that random arrays do not conform to the rules of tiling theory. Both sys- tems are bound by rules, however. What differentiates these random arrays from formal repetitive patterns is their inherent asymmetry and their tendency to result in exotic aggregate shapes. It is in the astounding variety of these shapes that the creativity of random- ness is found-not the creativity of human self-expression but rather a nat- ural sort of creativity such as seen in snowflakes; the system generates an in- credible variety based on a common theme.

Special emphasis on the enormous variety of com- posite voids or white shapes. CONTROLLING THE PARAMETERS OF RANDOMNESS The binding of randomness through rules or controlling parameters yields structures that are no longer random (in the truest sense) but rather main- tain an ingredient or imprint of ran- domness. The imposition of rules enor- mously influences the graphical appearance of randomness. In other words, the graphical characteristics of a random array are highly sensitive to even the slightest change in motif type, the density of motifs and the operating rules. The simple manipulation of these can lead to significant changes in the array. Figure 3 shows just such an instance; an array based on the identi- cal number sequence used in Fig. 2, with only a minor change in the motif, yields substantially different character- istics in the negative (white) shapes or voids. Figure 4 shows an even more dramatic change with the imposition of a linear motif. Controlling parameters for Figs 1-4 comprised three simple factors: (1) a random sequence of num- Eckersley, Randomness, Rules and Compositional Structure in Design 77</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 3. Detail view of large random distribution (variant comma motif), ratio 1:1. Motif rotation is random. Motif is a slight variation on the comma. Compare the difference in composite voids or white shapes from those in Fig. 2. (physical rules in the case of snow- flakes) and randomness contributes to the structured generation of original forms. The odds against these shapes occurring again in exactly the same way are great, and they increase consider- ably with the size of the given void, as well as with the complexity of the rules operating in their creation. Whereas the same odds may operate in the crea- tion of positive and negative aggregate shapes (the case in Figs 1-4), the nega- tive white shapes, or negamorphs, ap- pear somehow more compelling in their having been created as negative imprints of the former. As one scans the array, anthropomorphic and zoomor- phic shapes seem to crystallize before one's eyes. The compelling point is that this Noah's ark of randomly generated creatures is as large as the largest array one can generate. Whole new species of negamorphs can be generated with the imposition of different operating rules. DESIGN LESSONS FROM RANDOMNESS: EDUCATIONAL IMPLICATIONS One of the most difficult design prin- ciples for instructors to teach and for young designers to understand is that of dynamic asymmetry. Ironically, this most complex compositional principle is also fundamental to understanding modern notions of composition. Dy- namic asymmetry involves the ordering of compositional elements (i.e. shapes, lines, colors, etc.) in a manner that forges a compositional unity while pro- longing viewer scanning and delaying perceptual closure. It is as much an emotion evoked in the viewer by the composition as it is the spatial organiza- tion of the composition itself. Examples of dynamic asymmetry can be found in significant works of art, architecture and design from Mondrian's Broadway Boogie Woogie to Frank Lloyd Wright's Falling Water house. Randomness and design appear at first glance to be an incongruous match. The act of designing is usually a highly self-conscious, goal-directed ac- tivity, and that runs counter to most notions of randomness. However (and herein lies the second and most useful aspect of the randomness principle for designers), random graphical arrays, al- most without exception, exhibit strik- ing examples of dynamic asymmetry; localized sections of large arrays can be isolated and appreciated as powerful compositions. The educational impli- cations of this phenomenon are not trivial. A recurring project involving randomness and the definition of rules, motifs and colors has generated numer- ous beautiful designs, an example of which can be seen in Color Plate B No. 2. This project has been a useful point of departure in discussions focusing on issues of rule formulation and control in the design process. These discussions have made apparent to students and faculty alike that design is essentially nothing more (and nothing less) than an activity involving the formulation, invocation and reformulation of rules when existing rules fail to yield satis- factory results. In this sense the design process can be viewed as a cybernetic machine in which the rules define the capabilities of the machine, random- ness provides the input, and the design product is the output. Once the basics of the machine have been set forth, the creative designer manipulates or rede- signs the machine in such a way as to get more satisfactory designs. The de- signer's creativity is directly related to the intrinsic clarity, sophistication and inventiveness of the rules conceived and invoked. The function of rules as determin- ants of style are well exemplified in Fig. 5, where variables of line, shape, scale, placement, type font and type style (among others) operate in random fashion. The literal push of a button allows such designs to be generated al- most instantaneously. Randomness in this case does not render uniformly sat- isfactory results (this is not the issue), but one out of every seven or eight designs is quite presentable. The real power lies in the program's capability to allow for easy reconfiguration by its 78 Eckersley, Randomness, Rules and Compositional Structure in Design</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 4.

The motif in this case is a line segment. human counterpart to mirror the de- signer's own universe of acceptable op- erations. As such, the computer graphic representation can serve as a powerful point of departure for design- ers not wishing to face the often intimi- dating blank canvas. In other words, designers can establish upfront, in the form of simple algorithms, the parame- ters within which they wish to work graphically. Based on those parame- ters, if what the computer tosses up is broadly acceptable to the designer, he or she can proceed from there. These notions have been alluded to in the landmark research of Koenig and Eizenberg [18] on the design style of Frank Lloyd Wright, and have been more fully fleshed out in writings by this author [19]. SUMMARY While some would argue that random- ness is by definition without practical value, the trained eye begins to see in random structures a distinguishing order. This order is somehow under- standable on an intuitive level, reflect- ing certain natural or man-made laws bound together with chance. Its useful- ness to designers compares to the les- sons they can learn from observing nature's own random permutations of form. One gain from discussions of ran- domness in the design studio is that naive conceptions about randomness change as one learns to discern subtle distinctions between random processes and nonrandom processes. An addi- tional payoff is familiarity with a class of structures uniquely different from those self-conscious compositional structures with which we are commonly familiar. Random structures can be dis- tinguished from formal, semiformal and informal kinds of structures and should be classified as different. As the designer's visual language grows to ac- commodate random structures, so too does his or her verbal ability to differ- entiate them from other, more tra- ditional kinds of compositional struc- tures. Just as learning is enhanced by drawing comparisons and distinctions between concepts, so can understand- ing of customary structures be en- hanced through a learning experience with randomness.
