<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Import of the Totem.' - Miss Fletcher's studies have been aptly characterized as " sympathetic and thorough," and the present paper fully demonstrates the truth of the observation. Within the limits of a few pages is given a remarkably clear and concise account of the idea of the totem, one of the most obscure and perplexing subjects with which the student of American ethnology has to deal. The totem is based upon the Indian's belief concerning nature and life, and it is only through an explanation of his customs and prac- tices, a knowledge of his rites and ceremonies, that we may come to know what this belief is. There are two classes of totems among the Omahas: (i) personal, belonging to the individual, and (2) social, that of societies and gentes. The personal totem is obtained by means of a puberty rite in which the youth fasts until he sees or hears in a dream or vision some animal or other form. This thing becomes the special medium through which he can obtain supernatural aid. It is his duty to seek and slay the animal seen in his vision ('in cases where the vision has been of no concrete form, symbols are taken to represent it') and preserve some part of it. This amulet represented the power of the whole class to which it belonged, a conception growing out of the anthropomorphic projection of man's characteristics upon all nature and the belief in the continuity of life, " making it impos- sible for the part and the entirety to be disassociated." " The totem's simplest form of social action was in the religious societies, whose structure was based upon the grouping together of men who had seen similar visions, . . . blood relationship was ignored." "In the early struggle for existence, the advantages accruing from a permanent kinship group, both in resisting aggres- sion and in securing a food supply, could not fail to have been per- 1 The Import of the Totem: A Study from the Omnaha Tribe.

The common belief of the people, kept virile by the universal practice of the rite of the vision, furnished this expedient." " Social growth depended upon the establishment of distinct groups, and the one power adequate for the purpose was that which was believed to be capable of enforcing the union of the people by supernaturally inflicted penalties." There were ten gentes in the Omaha tribe; exogamy prevailed, and descent was traced only through the father. " Each gens had its particular name, which referred directly or symbolically to its totem, which was kept in mind by the practice of tabu." The office of the totem in the religious societies, in the gentes, and the tribe is described, and the paper closes with a discussion of the linguistic evidence as to the import of the totem.
