<plain_text><page sequence="1">INDIAN AND IRANIAN MYTHS INDIAN AND IRANIAN MYTHS There are no satisfactory scholarly works which treat the develop- ment of Indian or Iranian mythology in a historical way. Keith and Carnoy are to be congratulated on the success of these first attempts at a synthesis.' Both accounts well fulfil their purpose as popular sum- maries; both will also prove valuable to specialists. Keith and Carnoy have both contributed much in the past to the solution of special prob- lems of detail, but both have also been interested in the general develop- ment of ideas and have tried to trace the bearing of details on the more general problems involved. The judgment of the former is sober and keeps very close to facts; the latter is more speculative and venturesome in the projection of facts into theories. Keith devotes two chapters to the Rig-Veda, one to the Brahmanas, two to the Epic, one to the Puranas, one to Buddhism, one to Jainism, one to Modern Hinduism. Carnoy divides his treatment of Iranian myths into discussions of the wars of gods and demons, of myths of The Mythology of All Races. Vol. VI: Indian by A. B. Keith; Iranian by A. J. Carnoy.

Fourteen pages of notes refer to passages in the sources or give references on disputed points. Thirty-four pages are devoted to a carefully chosen bibliography, including a digest of all the articles in Hastings' Encyclopaedia which bear on Indian and Iranian mythology. Keith keeps strictly to the main line of mythology and offers little on the development of myth to legend, folklore, and traditional history. Carnoy devotes much space to this latter development in the Persian epic. In India the material is so vast and the historical background so obscure that no treatment of the subject could be satisfactory at present. Much of the material of the so-called Indian mythology is Dravidian or Munda rather than Aryan, but it is impossible, as yet, to distinguish Aryan from Dravidian with any certainty. The most satisfactory chapters of Keith are those on the Rig-Veda, the Brahmanas, and the Epic. The mythology of the Puranas, of modern Hinduism, and of Jainism is sketched cursorily in only the broad- est and most general outlines. The chapter on Buddhism, the most difficult one to write, is the least satisfactory of all. Here Keith's touch is much less firm and sure than in the earlier chapters. Keith feels assured (p. 188) that no Buddhist text can be proved to be as early as two hundred years after Buddha's death. So much can be granted, but, if this assumption is made, it is impossible to argue, as Keith does, that we have in the Pali canon "the authority of Buddha himself" for several important mythological details. In India myth and legend develop with amazing rapidity, and two hundred years are not to be dismissed lightly. If no text can be assigned positively to the period within two hundred years after Buddha's death, there is no certainty that the im- portant mythological matters assigned in the texts to Buddha himself can be earlier than two hundred years after the death of Buddha. It is becoming more and more certain that the Pali texts represent the ideas of only one sect. Different groups of monks interpreted the enigmatical teachings of Buddha according to their own thoughts and feelings. The Pali canon does not give us the unified tradition of Buddhism before the early split into sects. Much that is represented as the utterance of Buddha himself may be due to speculative accretion generations after his death. The "thus I have heard" is no more proof of originality than the corresponding formula in the Mahayana texts. Further, many elements in the life of Buddha himself, if the traditions are based on any real memories of the Master, show that he himself lived a life</page><page sequence="3">INDIAN AND IRANIAN MYTHS 157 of ministry nearer in many ways to the Bodhisattva ideal of the Mahayana than to the Arhat ideal of the Hinayina. Both Keith and Carnoy (pp. 5, 25, 30, 263-65) refer to the names found in the Hittite tablets at Boghaz-keui as Indo-Iranian and draw from them important conclusions concerning the relation of Indo- Iranian to Babylonian mythology. The reviewer has tried to show in an article in the American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures (1917, pp. 261-82) that the matters involved are, as yet, purely linguistic ones on which no historical conclusions should be based. Keith argues here, as elsewhere, that Krishna was originally a vegetation-god become anthropomorphic. He is over-skeptical of the possibility of men becoming gods in India. The classical prejudice against euhemerism is invalid in Hindu mythology. In the case of Krishna it is much easier to explain the mythology as a later accretion (as in the cases of Buddha and Mahavira) than as fundamental. The reviewer can interpret the figure of Krishna in the epic only as a man deified. Thae Krishna (son of Devaki) of the Chandogya Upanishad 3, 17, 6 cannot be lightly dismissed as not identical with Krishna (son of Devaki) of the Epic just because the identification invalidates a theory that Krishna must be a sun-god or a vegetation-god. The passage in Patanjali (150-140 B.C.), which Keith (p. 126) interprets as proving the performance of a vegetation rite in connection with Krishna, does not disprove the theory that Krishna was originally a human figure. Where among the vaguely anthropomorphic figures of early Hindu mythology is there one which has become so human, so concrete in outline, as the Krishna of the epic? Rama, perhaps ? But it is by no means certain that Rama is a purely mythical figure. On page 177 Keith follows Garbe in interpreting the Qvetadvipa story as having reference to contact of the Hindus with a Nestorian community, settled on an island in Lake Balkash. The recent evidence concerning the Nestorians collected by Pelliot in T'oung Pao (1914, pp. 623-44) conclusively disproves Garbe's theory, at least so far as present evidence goes. Garbe's arguments against Weber's identifica- tion of Qvetadvipa with Alexandria are conclusive. The story seems to be purely mythological. It may belong to the same development which resulted in the descriptions of Sukhavati in the Buddhist texts. There is no need of interpreting dvipa as referring to any actual island. It may be connected with the dvipas of Hindu and Jain cosmology. Carnoy has done well to call attention to the many curious coin- cidences between Iranian myths on the one hand and Indian and</page><page sequence="4">158 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY Babylonian myths on the other. Little can be deduced from such coinci- dences at present, but some day, when more historical evidence is available, comparisons such as these will be of the greatest value.
