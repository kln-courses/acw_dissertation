<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE REVELATORY CHARACTER OF HINDU EPISTEMOLOGY BY D. K. BEDEKAR 1. In the ancient civilised world, India enjoyed a more or less insular existence. This accounts for the uniqwnea » of Hindu ( which term should include Brahmanical, Buddhist, Jain, etc. ) social life and thoght. This uniqueness lends a unity to the extreme diversity of forms of philosophical thought and social life in ancient India. This uniqueness and consequent unity dominate Indian life throughout centuries, from Vedic antiquity to the dąys of Bevendranath Tagore and Vivekanand. In this essay, I have endeavoured tobring out this uniqueness as iťmanifests itself in Indian epistemological thought. It is widely recognised by students of Indian thought that while, on the one hand, all Western epistemology is based on the concept either of correspondence or of coherence , all the diverse schools of Indian epistemology build their theories on the con- cept of revelatory knowledge or the theory of non-contradiction. Now, what is revelation ? I have, in the succeeding pages, tried to answer this question 2. The pitfalls of language . Before I actually start the discussion, however, I must say something about the grave difficulty which is experienced in expressing Indian concepts in English terminology. Words have their own correct meanings. in their own environment; conversely taken out of their 4 natural ' context, they either cease to live, as fish out of water, or .acquire perverse and false significance. The latter calamity happens usually with philosophical terms. Let us take the word karma. The concept denoted by this term is vital to Indian thought. It becomes patent to students of Indian social life and thought that karma is the root of every- thing, be it ontology, epistemology, ethics or the concrete social life organised in quasi-natural castes. Thus it may be safely</page><page sequence="2">Revelatory Character of Hindu Epistemology 65 said that the doctrine of karma is the vital nexus which endows vitality and the power to live aud grow to all forms of specula- tive and social creativeness in ancient India. 1 Karma thus is the? navel from which radiate, like the spokes of a wheel, in innumera- ble directions, the particular systems of Indian thought and social acitvity. This central life-giving concept of karma , how- ever, suddenly becomes trivial and meaningless when expressed! in English as action or movement It is then relegated to the^ particular spheres of ethics ( as action ) or cosmology ( as move- ment ), and there also it acquires puerile meaning. This perverse metamorphosis of vital terms is at the root of much of the confusion that exists in relation to such important Hindu concepts as gurta, prakrti , maya, etc.,. The sam8 is true in respect of Western terms like idea, realism, etc., as and whem they are used in discussing Indian systems. 3. Distinct levels of human thought But apart from difficulty of language there is something deep- er in this mutual inconvertibility of terms like prakrti and matter. It is not a mere superficial question of distinct langua- ges but one of distinct planes or levels of human thought . Dr. S. hL Dasgupta ha3 expressed this, in the following words : " The modes of conceiving philosophical problems ( in ancient: India -DKB ) are therefore quita different from the current philo- sophical conceptions of th8 West. This fact causss additional difficulty for a modern student of philosophy in penetrating into the spirit of Indian ohiloaophy, for, steeped as our minds a.-e in modern thought, we cannot leap back into the old and unfamiliar atmosphere of Indian thought without straining our imagina- tion. " 2 So, it will be seen that underlying the inconvertible terms; there are distinct and mutually incompatible modes of thought. Thus, for instance the mode of thought of Kant or Hegel may superficially appear similar to that of Samkara and B&amp;mftnuja,» but essentially Kant and Hegel inhabit a different thought- 1 Already, in 1930, Dr. S. N. Dasgupta had endorsed this view in hi» Yoga Philosophy , ( p. 10 ). Recently, he has reiterated this karmie basis of all Indian thought in his Philosophical Essays , ( 1941 ) ; see pages 225 ff« 8 Yoga Philosophy , p. 4, 9 i Annals, B, O* R. K 1</page><page sequence="3">€6 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute world from that inhabited by Samkara and Rāmānuja. The first natural reaction of modern Indian philosophers after coming under the impact of Christianity and Western thought was to ^eek particular parallelisms and establish equality with Western systems, and, if possible, prove the superiority of the Indian over the Western. But, now, we know sufficiently about the East and the West to get over this tendency to set up parallelisms ; instead, we should, as Dr. Dasgupta has advised us to do, 44 strain out imagination " and study the Indian thought-world in juxta- position as a whole to the Western thought world. 4. Stages of human thought . But the mere juxtaposition of East and West, in the form of ^n irreconcilable contrast ( in the manner of Kipling ), will be not only meaningless but barbarous in philosophy, as in every- thing else. It is true that we must study the Indian and the Western thought-worlds, in contrast , if we have to avoidjfacile parallelisms. But, it is equally true that we must correctly assess the significance of and find the source of this contrast. To make my position clear I will take, as an example, a significant book by a veteran Indologist, Dr. Betty Heimann. In 1937, she published her book, Indian and Western Philosophy, &lt;i study in contrast . It can be seen that the very title of the book sets forth the aim, as well as the content, of the bookē She has admirably covered the whole range of Indian speculation, aesthetic creativeness and social, life, and has concisely and unerringly pointed out the fundamental issues of divergence between the Indian and Western thought-worlds. But, when it comes to reaching to the source of this patent divergence or contrast she postulates thus i Indian thought-world is 4 cosmic } while that of the West is * anthropomorphic ' The Cosmic character of Indian thought is determined by 4 the dominating pre-supposition of the force majeure of an almost eternal and irresistible tropical Nature * ; the 4 anthropomorphic 9 thought-world of the West, on the other hand, is so conditioned by 4 the temperate climate of the- European continent 9 1 1 Indian and Western Philosophy , page 17;</page><page sequence="4">Revelatory Character oj Hindu E polemology 67 I do not agree with Dr. Heimann in postulating such natural and climatic sources of the contrast. Instead, I believe in the Hegelian view of a continuous evolution of human thought and social life. For Hegel, the World-Spirit is cne , in other words, he postulates the view that ancient and modern thought- worlds, so also Eastern and Western thought-worlds, should be viewed as moments of a single gigantic process, - of the struggle of human society to arise out of its primitive dependence on Nature and to attain to an independent, rational and cooperative existence in full mastery of Nature as well as its own internal life. Th is integral and historical view of the development of human society and thought rejects the particularised view of permanently contrasted thought-worlds, as we find for instance in the work of Dr. Heimann. When all the thought-systems ever conceived by men, in whatever stage of civilization, are unified into a single indivisible process, the uniqueness of each system is invested with a relativeness along with its individua- lity. Each system becomes a part of the " biography of the World-Spirit", just as child-hood, adolscence and adulthood become three contrasted, independent but finally integrated stages in the single life of an individual. This Hegelian view, therefore, would free the modern Indian mind from the habits of easy comparisons and also would purge it of the desire to prove the * spiritual ' or * intuitive ' superiority of Indian thought over Westesn thought; instead, the Indian seeker will, when he accepts the Hegelian stand-point, seek the truth of a particular Indian system, or of Indian thought as a whole, in the comprehensive truth of human thought-evolution. 5. Three stages of human thought . I have, hitherto, emphasised the uniqueness of Indian thought and also defined the nature of this uniqueness in relation to the wholeness of human thought. This preliminary discussion will help us to grasp the unique revelatory nature of Indian epistemology and enable us to relate it to the modern epistemo- logica! theories of correspondence and coherence. But before we actually proceed to our main problem, it will; be helpful to have with us a rough scheme or skeleton of the* tage s of human thought-evolution which will serve as a sort of</page><page sequence="5">48 Annals oj the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute Teference while we discuss the concepts of revelation ( or non-* contradiction ), correspondence and coherence . The relations between being and thought , or in other words, between matter and mind ( or sat and cit ), is the central pro- Mem of all philosophy, and the stages of human thought-evolu- tion may be designated in relation to this problem. Thus three stages of evolution may be set down, a3 follows * Stage- I •- Undifferentiated Identity of Matter and Mind. Stage- II :- Differentiation and Duality of Matter and Mind. Stage- III:- Synthesis and Unity of Matter and Mind. 6. The stage of Undifferentiated Identity. This stage of Identity reaches back into primitive magic, which was the first thought-structure built by man. The rise of ancient civilisations marks the break with primitive magic, and the beginning of a mature phase of this Identity stage. This mature phase reaches its highest point in Greece and there it develops its internal contradictions to the fullest. Thus ripened this stage receives its death-blow at the hands of Plato and .Aristotle and a new thought-world is ushered in. Aristotle thus inaugurates the succeeding stage of differentiation and Duality of matter and mind, 1 The ancient Indian thought-world belonged to this mature phase of Identity. Its central doctrine of karma is based on the « advaita or undifferentiated identity of matter and mind. This karma principle genetically belongs to the first primitive stage of identity but in Indian thought-world it takes a mature form. This advaita and karma is at the root of Indian epistemology and explains the direct, revelatory and pragmatic character of the knowledge-process in all Indian systems. Adtaita being the basis of all Indian thought it is but natural that " advaita (of Samkara- DKB ) represents the Indian mind better than any other system of Indian philosophy 2 1 " In Aristotle the Notion emerges free and unconstrained as compre- hending thought, permeating and spiritualizing all the forms which the universe contains, " Hegel, * History of Philosophy ł ( Haldane, Simpson), Vol. Ill, p. 548. 8 Dr. P. T. Raju, Thought and Reality, p.</page><page sequence="6">Revelatory Char acier of Hindu Epistemology 69 This advaitic , mãyic or karmie character of Indian thought i» not the same as primitive magical thought. As Hegel puts it '** the view is superficial and perverted which maintains the Eastern to have lived in unity with Nature 1 This distinction between mãyic thought and magic of primi- tive man is of great importance, particularly because in my later discussion I have used the structure of primitive magical thought as an instrument to understand the processes of mãyic thought. Being the earlier and simpler form of structure it enables us to enter into more complicated form of karmie thought. But, I have always kept in view the distinction between these two phases of the stage of Identity. 7. The stage cf Duality. This stage begins with the nascent form of Aristotelian thought and becomes the metaphysical basis of Christian mono- theism. In this religious form, the universal * which permeates and spiritualises all forms which the universe contains, ' becomes the God, the creator. In the previous stage, Nature was dynamic, vibrant with life and energy, but in monotheism the world is reduced to mere passive existence and God is held to be the supreme artist who moulds this passive clay into diverse concrete forms. This dualism reached a second mature phase with Descartes. He conceived mind or human thought in the form of the ť I', who is capable of thought;. This individualism led to a mechanical view of the universe. Hegel says in this respect that in Carte- sian metaphysics 4 being is hence not demonstrated in the Notion of thought itself, for what advance has been made is merely in the direction of séparation only 2 In this advance in «operation of mind and matter 4 lies the mechanical fashion of viewing nature, or the natural philosophy of Descartes is seen to be purely mechanical '. s In epistemology, we find that correspcmdence between mind and matter, which are now held as two distinct and divorced 1 History of Philosophy Vol. I, p. 132. 1 History of Philosophy , Vol. Ill, p. 241. 8 Ibid, p. 247.</page><page sequence="7">7o Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute principles, is the basis of all theories of knowledge, in this stages of Duality as a whole. The earlier concept of knowledge^ revelation or direct contact ( upalabdhi ) is now rejected in favour of a new concept of knowledge by correspondence or by reflection a &amp;- in a mirror. 'Knowing', in the earlier stage of Indentity^ was equivalent to 4 getting or 4 getting by identification ' but, m this new stage of Duality, 4 knowing 9 was merely 4 reflecting 9 something alien in mind. This correspondence theory of knowledge was clearly propounded by Locke and all its inherent contradictions were finally developed into the mature system* of Kant. 8. The Stage of Unity . This stage was ushered in by Spinoza and reached its termina- tion in the systems of Hegel and his materialist followers,, Feuerbach and Karl Marx. Hegel calls Spinoza 44 a direct successor " to Descartes, and 44 one who carried on the Cartesmm principles to its farthest logical conclusions. For him Soul and Body, thought and being, cease to have separate independent existence. The dualism of the Cartesian system Spinoza, as a» Jew, altogether ret aside". This reference to the Jewish origin of Spinoza is very significant because Hegel explains this with the following * 44 For the profound unity of his philosophy as it found expression in Europe, his manifestation of Spirit as tho identity of the finite and the infinite in God, instead of God'a appearing to these as a Third, - all this is an echo from Eastern, lands. The Oriental theory of absolute identity was brought by" Spinoza much more directly into line, firstly with the current of European thought and then with European and Cartesian philo- sophy in which it soon found place ". 1 ( Emphasis mine - DKB. )- In the above, we get a glimpse of that Unity of mind and matter ( or of thought and being ), which was achieved Spinoza and, at the same time, Hegel shows us how this unity brings the human mind back to the Oriental theory of absolute Identity . But, Hegel does not believe in such a relapse. Thenr what does he mean by the Oriental character of Spinozars thought ? 1 History of Philosophy , Vol III, p. 252.</page><page sequence="8">Revelatory Character of Hindu Epislemology 71 Hegel only means this that in the third stage of Unity both the «earlier stages, namely those of Identity and Duality, are absorbed ^nd given a new significance. Thus, he says explicitly that" the pure thought of Spinoza is therefore not the simple universal of PJato, for it has likewise come to know the absolute opposition of Notion and Being".1 This, Unity is distinct from the un- differentiated Identity of pre-Aristotelian thought. This concept of unity finally matured in the system of Hegel. His 4 Absolute ' is a rational and conceptual construction and not a supra-rational * Substance 9 as the * absolute ' in Indian thought. In his system, * mind 9 ceases to be merely contigent and subjective, and 4 matter 9 ceases to be clay-like, passive and a mere aggregate of dead fragments. Both acquire self-move- ment and finally the concrete self-movement of the universe becomes the manifestations of the self-movement of the World- Spirit. Thus, in the 4 biography of the Spirit Hegel sees the concrete stages of material and biological 1 evolution and the social evolution of Man. Inverting this Hegelian concept of a World-spirit, his materialist followers, Feuerbach and Marx, further matured this mind-matter-unity by placing it on its rational material basis. In the Hegelian system, there is still a vestige of the Dualism between the contemplative Spirit and inert matter. Rejecting this, Marx conceived of the 4 spirit ' not as the contemplating individual but as the thought and practi- cal social activity of men , in social existence . He conceived 4 matter 9 as self-moving matter. Thus he completes the unity of human thought aud itsfmaterial basis and environment. In this stage of unity epistemology rejects the theory of correspondence based on Dualism and develops the new concept oi coherence. There is also the new urge to reconcile, even unite, knowledge with practice . Pragmatism now as if reiterates the maxim of the ancient philosophers of the Identity stage, that 4 knowing is getting 9 ( prapakam jnanam pramariam). Hegel says 44 Pure thought has advanced to the opposition of the sub- jective and the objective ( in the stage of Duality-DKB. ) : the true reconciliation of the opposition is the perception that this 8 Ibid, P. 257.</page><page sequence="9">72 Annals oj the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute opposition, when pushed to its absolute extreme, rerolves itself ; as Schelling says, the opposites are in themselves identical and not only in themselves, but eternal life consists in the very process of continually producing the opposition and continually reconciling it. To know opposition in unity and unity in opposi- tion-this is absolute knowledge, and science is the knowledge of this unity in its whole development by means of itself/' 1 ( Emphasis mine - DKB. ). This quotation from Hegel gives us, in a nutshell, the episte- mology of the stage of Unity. The opposition of mind and matter is now perceived but it is also reconciled. This reconcilia - lion is neither identification of the two as in the Identity-stage nor reflection of the one in the other as in the Duality-stage. It is living 4 process 4 Eternal life ? of mankind is itself this process. In other words, the subject and object, or mind and matter,1 are* united or reconciled to each other through the endless endea- vour of men in social existence . 9. Realism in Hindu Epistemology. I will now revert to the main problem, namely a discussion on Indian epistemology with a view to emphasizing its uni- queness. It can be seen at the very outset, that the basic pro- blem of knowledge before the Indian thinkers was one that was faced neither by Kant nor by Hegel. For Kant, the rigid Dualism, or opposition, of mind and matter was a pre-supposi- tion, and hence knowledge of the 4 thing-in-itself ' was a riddle. For Hegel, the riddle was resolved into the new concept of an 4 eternal life ' which continually produces the opposition of mind and matter only to reconcile it continually. But, this very opposition is alien to the Indian thought-World. Hence, here, the problem of knowledge is also differently posed and solved. This uniqueness of the premises of Indian epistemology has already been discussed by such eminent thinkers as Dr. S. N. Dasgupta. They have come to the conclusion that Indian episte- mology is 4 realistic ' and 4 pragmatic ' In his Yoga philosophy f Dr. Dasgupta has emphasised this 4 realism ' while discussing the theory of guyas ; in his recent Philosophical Essaysf he lias 1 History of Philosophyi Vol. Ill, p, 551.</page><page sequence="10">Revelatory Character of Hindu Epistemology 73 striven to show the * realism ' of Samkara's Vedãnta. Now this 4 realism ' of Indian thought, which only apparently links it up with the modern schools of realism, empiricism, pragmatism, etc., is only the manifestation of the fact that since 4 matter ' and ' mind * were not held in opposition as in post- Aristotelian philo- sophy, by the Indian epistemologists, they did not postulate either subjective idealism or rigid mechanical materialism. So, if we want to go deeper into the uniqueness of Indian epistemology we should turn from this realism to something more specific, which will enable us to go to the root of |he problem. 10. Some modern Indian authors on thè revelatory theory of knowledge . We get a glimpse of such a specific and distinctive aspect of Indian epistemology in an epigram used by Drš Hiriyanna. He says that according to Indian epistemology 44 knowledge can show but cannot know. " 1 What is the meaning of this paradox ? A full answer can only be provided throu gh detailed discus- sion of the whole content of the Indian theory of knowledge. But one thing can be seen, even at this stage namely, that knowledge, as conceived in Indian thought, is only a unique way of showing objects, but not of getting into any contemplative relation with them. In the stages of Duality and Unity, ' knowledge ' is both 4 showing ' and 'knowing'; in fact, the such a distinction between 'showing* and 4 knowing * is alien and incomprehensible to post- Aristotelian thought. Here, we also coma up against the unique phenomenon to 4 revelation ' Revelation is not 4 knowing ' in the modern sense of the term, since there is neither correspondence nor coher- ence between such categories as 4 mind * and 4 its objects ' invol- ved in the phenomenon of revelation. At the same time, revela- tion is not the absence of what may be called knowledge. In fact, it is a unique kind, of knowledge and somehow it justifies the term ' showing * adopted JjyjDr. Hiriyanna to describe this phe- nomenon. 1 Ramanuja's Theory of Knowledge , Indian Philosophical Congress Proceedings, 1925, p. 73. 10 [ Annali, B. O. R» ī. ļ</page><page sequence="11">74 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute Let us turn to another writer. Prof. P. N. Srinivasachari says that the Visistādvaita theory of knowledge is " revelatory and not representative. 1 He shows clearly, in the following paragraph, the vital distinction between the Western ( Idealistic and Realistic ) theories of knowledge and the theory of Rāmānuja • " The distinction drawn by some Western objective Idealists between idea in the psychological sense of a perishing psychical representation and idea in the logical sense of reference to reality is artificial, since juana is as real as the object known and since there is no barrier between the subjective and the objective. " * Another modern Indian author draws a similar conclusion from Vedāntic epistemology. Discussing the epistemology of Śrlharsa, Dr. S. K. Saksena, says that the Vedãnta theory of knowledge is revelatory and can be objected to only if one and the same thing cannot be considered " both a subject and an object. " B Here I shall refer to a remark made by Dr. S. N. Dasgupta regarding the epistemological theory of the Sauträntikas. " This account of perception leaves out the real epistemologi- cal question of how the knowledge is generated by the external world or what it is in itself. It only looks to the correctness or faithfulness of the perception to the object and its value for us in the practical realisation of our ends. The question of the relation of the external world with knowledge as determining the latter is regarded as unimportant. " 4 This estimate of Sautrãntika epistemology is really valid regarding the entire domain of Hindu epistemology. Dr. Das- gupta observes, after summarizing the theories of the Buddhist, Sañikhya, Mimāmm, aud other systems : " But the question remained unsolved as to why inspite of the unique character of knowledge, knowledge could relate itself to the world of objects , how far the world of external objects or of know- ledge could be regarded as absolulely true. Hitherto, judgements 1 Philosophy of Viâistadvaita, p. 43. * Ibid 30. • Nature of Consciousness in Hindu Thought , p. 73. é History of Indian Philosophy, Vol. I, p. 41Ö.</page><page sequence="12">Revelatory Character of Hindu Epistemology 75 were only relative, either referring to one's being prompted to the objective world, to the faithful representation of objects, the suitability of fulfilling our requirements, or to verification by later uncontradicted experience. But no inquiry was made whether any absolute judgements about the ultimate truth of knowledge and matter could be made at all . That which appeared was regarded as the real . " 1 The words emphasised by me, in this quotation, show how the Indian epistemologists did not even moot the basic problem of post- Aristotelian epistemology. 11. The nature of ł revelation ' From the quotations, cited above, from various modern Indian authors, we can see thst Hindu epistemology had not set before itself the same problem as the one posed and answered by post- Aristotelian philosophy. I have already stated that this distinct difference of approach to the problem of knowledge between Hindu and post-Aristotelian epistemology arises out of the fact that the Hindn thought world is based on an undifferentiated Identity of mind and matter, while the post- Aristotelian thought world is based, firstly, on Duality of these two entities, and, secondly, on their Unity. We have also tentatively found that the Indian theory of knowledge is revelatory. It is necessary now to go into the exact nature of this 4 revelatory ' knowledge process. In this connection, we can start with a simile which occurs so often in Hindu epistemology. It is the celebrated simile of the lamp, its rays and the illuminated objects. According to Hindu epistemology, knowledge arises as the revelation, or illumination , of objects by a lamp. Rays of light contact the objects and enter into a relation of contact and, identity with them, while the lamp remains unaffected The lamp, however, is essential for this phenomenon of illumination. At times, the rays of light are substituted by the simile of water which runs into fields of different shapes. In the process of knowledge, the objects ( or jaeļa bãhyãrtha ) are contacted and identified with the 4 rays ' of knowledge or dharma-bhUta-jñana and the 4 self ' merely shines and remains unaffected as the lamp. 1 History of Indian Philosophy , Vol. I, pp. 417-418.</page><page sequence="13">7 6 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute These similes of the lamp, and of water in fields, are only etude models and are apt to create certain wrong impressione. For instance, in the case of the lamp simile, we must note that the Hindu systems do not have anything in common with the Aristotelian and the Cartesian concept of the 4 Self 7 ( logos or nous) or the subject as the knower. In the simile, the lamp is apt to be mistaken for the term 4 knower in its modern connotat- ion. But, in all Hindu systems, there is a sharp distinction drawn between a 4 knower ' and an 4 illuminator 7, for example, the pratyak and the paraka in ViéistUdvaitj or atman and jlva in other systems. In Aristotle, on the other hand, pure thought, 4Form7 or nous is not so divided into itself but is one single whole. It is not mere potentiality like the 4 illuminator 7, but is the 4 unceasing activity of thought' of a monolithic Self. In the famous dictum of Descartes, 4 Cogito ergo sum 7, the Self is affirmed only on the basis of its thinking activity. In contrast of this, however, as we shall see in the following analysis, Hindu Epistemology has divorced the 4 knower 7 from the 4 illuminator / 12. The divorce between the 4 knower 7 and the 4 illuminator . 7 This divorce between the 4 knower 7 and the 4 illuminator 7 is so vital to the whole structure of Indian epistemology, ( as also to the other branches of Indian philosophy ), that it may be safely considered the fundamental pre-supposition underlying the whole theory of 4 revelatory 7 knowledge. This divorce finds expression in the old famous Vedic mantra of dvã suparņā , ( R.V.I* 162, 20), and also remains the basis of the later Samkara-Vedāntio concept of the adhyãsa. It runs, therefore, like a red thread throughout the evolution of the Indian thought-world. The main point about this divorce between the 4 knower * and the 4 illuminator 7 is that we have before us a unique 4 splitting up 7 of the human ego or Self, as we, moderns, understand it. All the activities of the human mind, which are integrated into an organic whole as the personality and 4 I ' oř an individual are are attributed, in Indian thought, only to the 'knower7 (jlva) i. e. to a fraction of the whole. The part that 4 stands over 7 this 4 knower 7 is the 4 illuminator 7 ( atinan ). Both have none of the- attributes which we today ascribe to the Self. Particularly, tho</page><page sequence="14">Revelatory Character of Hindu Epistemology 77 4 illuminator * has one unique 4 function ' and that is of flooding the activities of the 4 knower 9 with 4 light 9 or 4 energy*. This whole ancient mode of reasoning is alien to our modern Indian minds and hence we must exercise or 4 strain * our imagi- nation to get at the root of this apparently mystifying affair. To help our imagination we may profitably adopt a simple device and that is to analyse, in a concrete and patient manner, the primitive theory and practice of sympathetic magic, which also based on the Identity of mind and matter. Before I turn to this problem of primitive magic, I wish to draw a comparison between the 4 activities of the knower * in Indian thought and those of the 4 knower ' in modern thought. In modern thought, the cognitive, affective and volitional reactions aroused by an object in a subject actually inhere only in the subject. The sensation of colour, seen by the eye, and the fear, felt in the heart, on seeing a snake belong to the mind of the perceiver. But this is not the case with the 4 knower * in Indian thought. Here there is no mere correspondence but actual identification between the object, the sense-organs, the sensa- tions, affections, volitions, etc. This point is both important and rather incomprehensible to our modern minds, so that I shall dwell on it in some detail. While discussing the Buddhist concept of rūpa , Dr. S. N. Dasgupta writes as follows : 44 No distinction seems to have been made between the sense - data as colours, smells, etc. as existing in the physical world and their appearance as sensations. Buddhism did not probably start with the same kind of division of mind and matter as we now do. And it may not be out of place to mention that such an apposition and duality were found neither in the Upanisads nor in the Samkhya system, which is regarded by some as pre- Buddhi- stic. " 1 The words underlined by me, show how the identification of sensations and sense-data is empressed by the term rupa&gt; The equivocation, expressed in the word 4 probably ' with which Dr. Dasgupta states the general character of this theory of Iden- tity, is however wholly unwarranted. I think we must clearly 1 History of Indian Philosophy Vol. I, p. 95.</page><page sequence="15">78 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute realise the full sway of this principle of Identity in the entire diversity and history of Indian thought. I may add that, in Indian speculation, we find that not only sensations ( like those of colour ) but affections, cognitions and volitions also are so identified with the 4 objects ' and thus instead of having before us a,n objective world, we have prakrli which is panca-bhutātmikā$ i. e. the projection of the five sense-organs of man. Similarly, the vital principle or driving force behind this prahrti is also the quasi-human category of kūma. In contrast, we can see that such an 4 identification ' of the 4 knower ' and the prakrli is wholly alien, nay unthinkable, in post-Aristotelian thought. In the modern representational knowledge-process, the sense-data do not become identified either with the sense-organs or with the sensations and other ideations of the subject. There is also no general 4 illumination ' of such an identity. On the contrary, the knowing 4 self', as a whole, actively seeks to reflect, or to represent, the object. This subject- object relationship forms the common ground for all the diverse and conflicting schools of modern materialism and idealism. Their mutual conflict regarding the primacy of mind over matter, or vice versa, is carried on against this common back- ground. As we have already seen the study of the problem of Indian epistemology has to be undertaken against an entirely 'different back-ground. Reverting to the problem of the 4 revelatory ' nature of knowledge, we will now seek to grasp this unique concept, with reference to a simpler psychic phenomenon, namely, that of sympathetic primitive magic. 13. Thè psychosis of sympathetic magic. We have already seen that in an act of revelatory knowledge, eay perception of a stag by a hunter, the following dual process, takes place 5 firstly, the sense-perceptions and other ideations of the 4 knower ' about the stag get identified with the real stag ; secondly, this identification is illumined by the 4 illuminator ' Both the 4 knower ' and 4 illuminator ? together constitute the 4 mind 9 of the hunter. Now, if we take the help of the researches of the anthropologists in the domain of primitive magic we get an astoundingly similar phenomenon. It has been found that a a</page><page sequence="16">Revelatory Character of Hindu Epislemology 79 Aurignacian hunter-artist has drawn a rcck-painting of a stag, with the sole purpose of 4 operating ? on the real stag, which is identified, in his primitive mind, with the picture drawn on the rock. This practical aim or purpose of the hunter-artist is what the anthropologist calls sympathetic magic. We must now see how this psychosis functions as a knowledge process. The hunter-artist draws on a rock a corporeal picture representing his sensations, desires and general ideas about the stag. As a magic-dominated thinker, he believes thoroughly in the identity of his sensations and ideas, firstly, with their pictorial representations, and, secondly, of all these with the 4 real ' stag. On the basis of this identity of the 4 real ' and 4 ideal ' he per- forms magical rites in relation to the picture. The rites, he believes, will be efficacious in relation to the real stag. Let us, hereafter, denote this identity of the psychic, pictorial and real 4 aspects ' of the stag by the word 4 stag-complex ' which is for the artist-magician, neither a mental nor a material thing, but a psycho-physical concrete substance. It may be noted here that for the magic-dominated primitive man the real stag of the modern man does not exist. For him the 4 stag-complex 7 alone is fully real. The word citra in fact indicates this position of the primitive man because it refers both to the picture and to at , that is the ideations of the artist. Similarly, for instance, the word bhesaja indicates both an objective remedy for a disease and a charm, which is the same as a wish to cure. Such real as well as magical meanings will be found to be integrated into most of the ancient terms like citra , yantraf bheęaja , etc. The stag-complex is taken to be a reality, a substance or a dravya by the artist-magician, otherwise he would not seek to operate on that assumption. All the mutilations of the stag- picture vitally and organically affect the stag-complex, of which the picture is only one coextensive 4 limb At times, there are no mutilations but attempts to propitiate the stag-com- plex. The artist-magician then dons a stag-horn head-dress, and dances the stag-dance. He believes that in his dance- ecstacy, he will become the stag-complex, just as the picture drawn in perfect communion with the stag-complex had par*</page><page sequence="17">žo Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute taken of its full reality. All this is similar to the prāņa-prcUisthā ceremony which invests an idol with divinity and power. 14. 4 Revelation 9 in magic practices . In this primitive psychosis, we discover very vital elements that throw light on the 4 revelatory ' theory of knowledge, be- cause in the mental process of the- hunter-artist, we get the same dual process as was seen in 4 revelatory ' knowledge. Firstly the cstag-complex is not a representational 1 relation between a real stag and its mental picture. On the contrary, it is a unique identification, which can be understood by oar modern minds, only by inference and by straining our imagination. The ques- tion now arises : what is 'revelatory' in this primitive payohosis? The answer is found in the magic rites performed by the artist- magician. What does he attempt to achieve by either drawing the picture of the stag-complex. or by dancing the stag-dance? The stag-complex exists as a Substance', or as a 'psycho-physical' identity. What does the magician, then, achieve by these magic rites? Surely, be does not want to establish anew the identity, which already exists, for hirn, a3 a fact and a substance. .All the sensations desiras and ideas] of the hunter about the stag have already, in a unique way, divorced themselves from the ¿unter and have * joined ' inextricably into the stag-complex, and, hence, the hunter-magician is not performing the rite3 to establish any psychical relationship with the stag. The meaning of the hunter's magical practices, then, in the .epistemologica! sense, is in the fact that he is trying to flood the stag-complex with a larga parnou at of 4 energy 9 in the form of intense creative effort, both mental and physical. This 'energy' is 4 created ' in the very effort to create the art-forms ( picture or dance ), related to the stag-complex. By this fc flooding ' he thinks that he not only 4 knows * the stag-complex but he 4 gets it.' He is seeking, in other words, ^communion with it and is attempting, with th8 help of intense 4 energy ', 4 to grasp ' the stag-complex. In other words, his attempt is to master and control it, by efforts or tapas . Now, this 4 flooding with one's energy ' a stag-complex, is an act of 4 illumination '. This is revelation, which appears to the hunter-magician an 4 act of knowledge '. In this act, however, Jais sensations, desires, ideas, etc., are -4 external to his illuminât-</page><page sequence="18">Revelatory Character of Hindu Epistemology 81 ii)g ' self and are a - part ' or 4 aspect 9 of the stag-complex. If his own * thoughts ' and 4 ideas ' are thus external to the him, who, then, 4 knows ' the stag-complex ? This query did not worry the primitive magician, but it formed the basis of the later dual concept of the 4 illuminating ' self ( atman ) and the 4 knowing 9 jíva, in ancient pre- Aristotelian thought-world. I have so far tried to show the real genesis aud primitive basis of the 4 revelatory ' theory of knowledge, namely, the magic-identification of the 4 real 1 and 4 mental' aspects of things in 4 psycho-physical complexes ' and the 4 illumination 9 of such complexes by intense effort. In the case of the hunter-artist, the aesthetic and magical activities were the practical manifesta- tions of the act of 4 illumination ' The Anrignacian magic- believing man was temporally only very remotely related to the man of the ancient civilised world ; but, I see no reason why we should not see a continuation of this primitive concept of 4 illumi- nating 9 and 4 knowing 9 in the 4 revelatory ' theory of know- ledge, which we find in all pre-Aristotelian thought. 15. 4 Kratu 9 and 4 manas '. It is but natural that in the earlier stages of Indian epistemo- logy we should come across some direct vestigial evidences of the fact that the 'revelatory' theory is a continuation from the knowledge-theory of primitive magic. I think we have such a proof in Śatapatha Brahmaņa X, 6, 3, wherein it is said that the purusa is kratumaya , manomaya and samkalpamaya. Dr. Jwala Prasad, while commenting on this hymn has translated the word kratu as 4 understanding ' and rejected the usual meaning given to the word, namely, 'will'. He also refers to the fact that there is a reference to 'meditation', in the context. 1 I suggest, however, that kratu is not 4 understanding ' but 4 meditation that too 4 meditation ' not in the modern sense of 4 contemplation' but something in the nature of that effort ( leae- ing to esctacy ) which characterised the creative effort of the hunter-magician. In fact, the word tapas does convey to us the picture of mental and physical effort and it is this effort which 4 floods ' the manas with energy. What is this manas ? It is that knowing part of the purusa which gete in contact and gets identi- i Indian Epistemology, p. 34. 11 ( Annals, B. O. E. I« ]</page><page sequence="19">82 Ännals ot the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute fied with the artha or external world. Thus the manomaya aspect of tho purusa is the upalabihr 'knower* while the kraiumaya aspect is the jñUtr 4 illuminator ' The manomaya purusa is, however, as much an 4 aspect ' of the purusa as it is an 'aspect' of the world of nāma-rūpa . The earli- est reference to this doctrine of nāma-rūpa , in Śatapatha XI, 2, 3, 1 is again significant. In this passage, it is said that the brahman 'knew' the universe through nāma-rūpa. The word used for 4 knowing * is pratyavaid and it has been differently translated by Indologists, as 4 descending ' 4 pervading 4 attaining ' and 4 knowing, ' the last rendering being that of Dr. Jwala Prasad. 1 Actually, I think, all the renderings express partially what is expressed in the concept of nāma-rūpa. The full meaning of nāma-rūpa can be grasped with the help Of our reference to the duality of 4 illuminations ' and] 4 knowing ' in early thought. Thus the term 4 pratyavaid ' can be understood by equating brahman with the 4 illuminator ' who remains unaffected when the sensations and sense-data fuse together to form what is called the nama-rupa , or complexes such as the stag-complex. How can the 'illuminator' know anything except through the act of flooding this nāma-rūpa with his energy ? This act of flooding with energy is the only and unique relation between brahman and the nāma-rūpa . This act is described so often as tapas and sometimes as the desire of the brahman 4 to pervade to 4 to descend to ' 4 to attain ' or 4 to know ' the nāma-rūpa . The act is, in fact, similar to the rites of the magician-hunter, who seeks 4 to know ' the stag-complex. This explanation, I think, brings us nearer to the real import of the term praiyvaid , and also shows us how the concepts of brahman and nāma-rūpa are based on the unique dualism of 4 the illuminator ' and 4 the knower ' This unique 4 split up ? of the 4 illuminator ' and the 4 knower 7 presented Indian philosophy with its central problem oí explain- ing the 4 connection ' between these two entities, and this led to the unique concept of yoga ( connection X This is also the womb in which the concept of karma , with its earlier forms in rta , etc., was developed. Karma is, thus, the mode of existence of the nāma-rūpa , while the 4 illuminator '* stands in the unique relation- i Ibid, p- 37,</page><page sequence="20">Revelatory Character of Hindu Epistemology 83 ship of aloofness and illumination to this karmie world of flux ( Samsara ). 16. Pragmatism in 4 revelatory ' knowledge . I will now pass on to some aspects of the 4 revelatory ' theory, which reinforce my general proposition. It is noted by students of Hindu epistemology that knowledge in Hindu thought, is, by its nature, efficacious ( prāpaka ) and intuitional ( pratyaksa ). It is quite easy to see why 4 revelatory 9 knowledge is bound to be efficacious, because a 4 revelation ' is only flooding the nāma-rūpa 4 complex ' with a peculiar energy. This flooding as if vitalizes or energizes the complex. The desires, which form the components of the complex, get vitalized and 4move' towards fulfilment, or kārna becomes kratu and karma. Thus in 'revelatory' epistomelogy, 4 to know ' a thing is also 4 to get 9 ( grahaņa ) it. It is quite easy too see how the test of the validity of knowledge is not the same in Indian thought as in modern dualistic episte- mology. In the latter, true knowledge is achieved when an object is fully represented in thought ; it is held that 4to know' is to enter into a rational or contemplative relationship with the object. In the English language, we find such synonyms for 4 knowing ' as 4 grasping 9 or 4 getting ? but they only testify to the vestigial remains of primitive concepts of knowledge in the language used by modern men. In the real fundamental sense, however, the modern dualistic concept of 4 knowing ' signifies only 4 represent- ing in one's mind ' an alien object. In Hegelian, and more explicitly in Marxian philosophy, however, a unity between the 4 rational ' and the 4 real 9 or between 4 theory 9 and 4 practice * is propounded. This is a natural cornv lary to the principle of unity between mind and matter, in general. But this unity between 4 theory f and 4 practice 9 is quite different from the prñpakatva of Hindu epistemology. In the prapaktva latter, the revelation only brings out the undifferentiated Identity between the knower, the known and the act of knowedge* 4 Revelation 9 or 4 illuminations ' is only an Wanness*. It may be dim or bright according to the quantity and intensity of mental energy that is flooded into the nama-rupa complex. This 4 awareness however, is the grahaņa or the pragmatic appropriation of the object of knowledge, in Hindu epistemology*</page><page sequence="21">84 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute It can be easily seen that the unity of theory and practice in the Hegelian and Marxian sense is in no way similar to this prâpakatva of ancient thought. This contrast between the ancient theory of Identity and the modern theory of the unity of theory and practice can be best understood in relation to the problem of 4 freedom To the modenr man knowledge is a means to the attainment of freedom. But, this freedom is not the power to go beyond the laws of Nature or of social environment. In fact, freedom is the 4 recognition of necessity ' or the full understanding of these laws, and it is in conformity with these laws that man can progress towards social and individual perfection. The growing mastery of man over Nature and over his social life is a pragmatic testimony of this freedom attainable through knowledge. * But, ' freedom ' has a different meaning in ancient Hindu thought. This 4 freedom ' is also attainable through knowledge, but it is not knowledge of laws but Revelation' of things, which may or may not conform to natural and social laws. This 4 freedom 7 is, therefore, unfettered. This is paradoxical, because in real life the ancient man had vary limited power over his material and social environment. But, the paradox only shows that the 4 freedom 9 was similar to the freedom enjoyed by a child when it creates a world of fantasy for itself. It will be clear, therefore, that the meaning of prapakatva , in Hindu epistemology, is the power of 4 revelation 9 to create a 4 private world ' and endow it with the validity of reality. This conclusion may be summarised in these words of Dr. B. L. Atreya ♦ 4i The Indian theory of knowledge satisfies intellectual, voli- tional and emotional demands of the individual It ensures full freedom to him not only in the Western- narrow sense of the choice out of the given alternatives of action, but of imagining and creat- ing any kind of the objective world for himself 1 ( Emphasis mine- DEB ). We have seen above the real meaning of the prapakatva. or 1 pragmatism 7 of Hindu epistemology. We shall come to a similar conclusion if we examine its 4 realism ' The unique concept of adyasa , so thoroughly discussed in the Hindu systems, can also be analysed in a new way along the lines, which I have followed here. I have discussed these problems of 4 realism ' adyasa, etc, , in an essay which will form a sequel to this one. 1 Yoga Vasitfha, p, 602.</page></plain_text>
