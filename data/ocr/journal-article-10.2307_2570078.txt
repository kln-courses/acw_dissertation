<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BIOLOGICAL VARIATE AND CULTURE JAMES W. WOODARD HANKS to psychology and psychi- atry, we no longer think of men as divided into widely separated groups, say the 'normal,' then a wide unfilled gap, and then the mentally defective, the first of equal normality, the second of equal defectiveness. Or again of the 'normal,' then a wide unfilled gap, and then the insane, the first equally sane, the second equally aberrant. Rather, there are grada- tions within normality, gradations within defectiveness and aberrance, and grada- tions in the borderline categories. And if we have a large enough group, cases pile up in unbroken series along a line from one extreme to the other and in such a way as to give us the familiar normal curve-few at the great extremes, more as we approach the middle, most at the middle. Further, whatever the precise role of nature and nurture in this phenomenon, as further research may define it, it is generally main- tained that a simnilar distribution occurs from hereditary factors alone. In the light of science, the once axiomatic state- ment that all men are born free and equal is wholly false, neither implication being substantiated. With this statement of the general fact of individual differences, let us proceed in a somewhat discursive fashion to consider some of the significances of the biological variate for huwman culture. In the first place, it is apparent that most of the cultural advance occurs at the</page><page sequence="2">BIOLOGICAL VARIATE AND CULTURE it hands of a relatively small number. Most anyone can learn to run a Ford, can tune in on a radio, can purchase a book. Not nearly so many can invent the contrivance, discover the principle, or organize and pro- pound the material involved. The group of innovators, organizers, and executive managers is a small one in the current life of any group. And if we consider the extent to which the leaders in the various fields of human endeavor are dependent upon the accumulated body of knowledge and practice in their fields, we see that the number of those who have made important contributions, contributions of fundamen- tal significance, is extremely small. The student successfully carrying on university work has been estimated by Witmner as in a class of zo per cent superior to 8o per cent of the general population in competency. Yet he spends most of his life absorbing and digesting, learning materials and principles which some one more competent than himself has discovered and organized. The professor who teaches him differs from him too often only in that he has absorbed and digested for a longer time. Only occa- sionally has he made some slight addition here, some refinement there. The leaders whose leadership has lasted for generations and for centuries, those who have analyzed the orientation points themselves, those who have made the fundamental contribu- tions which have revofutionized beliefs and techniques, these are those rare bio- logical sports, the geniuses. So that it would be quite conservative to say that five per cent of the population do the think- ing for the other 95 per cent. The feeble- minded do practically none of their own thinking; a larger group can be given a habit training which enables them to func- tion satisfactorily in the particular group, but they contribute nothing; the large bulk of average members work out a slow accretion of trial and error improvements; a smaller group of fairly superior indi- viduals are the leaders of the moment, cap- able at least of absorbing a large share of the cultural heritage and teaching it in turn to the rising generation, capable of organizing the current flow of resource potentialities, human and material, along lines already laid down and of giving a somewhat swifter pace to slight refine- ments and trial and error accretions; while the very small group of geniuses have been the fundamental contributors, the real pace-makers of progress. Certainly it is true that the bulk of the population spend their lives learning techniques they did not devise, using devices they did not invent, mastering bodies of knowledge they did not search out and discover, and conform- ing themselves to institutions, customs, and standards in the formation of which they have had little or no active part. This gives to the superior variate a highly important role in the development of culture. And the fact that there is a larger absolute number of superior variates in the larger population is one reason why civilization and population have always gone more or less hand in hand. So im- pressive is the role of the superior that it has given rise in the past to a lop-sided in- terpretation of civilizational advance, the great man theory of history. This inter- pretation looks upon the historical process as resulting from the influence of the great men stamping their imprint upon and swaying the successive periods. It is unilateral principally in that it tends to overlook the influence of the period in turn upon the great man who epitomizes some one or another of its tendencies. Thus there were several centuries of Mes- sianic hope before they became epitomized, though in a manner stamped with his indi- vidual characteristics, by the carpenter of Nazareth. Thus there has been a long chafing at British domination and the</page><page sequence="3">SOCIAL FORCES Western European culture before Ghandi. Similarly, there was a long antagonism on fundamentally economic grounds to which a geographic interpretation may be given before the conflict over slavery in this country led, after futile attempts by John Brown, Vesey, Garrison, and others, to the more timely leadership of Lincoln. In the wider sweep of cultural change, the dependence of the leader and innovator upon his times (and upon what has gone before) is even more marked. Shakes- peare could not have functioned as we know him without benefits, direct and indirect, from the schools and the leaders of his day, and much less so without the whole evolution of language from its conceivable primitive state of inarticulate cries and gestures through enlarging vocabularies and refined definiteness and shades of rmean- ing, from rude ideagraphs through hiero- glyphics, written alphabets, and the like, to the facile instrument for thought expres- sion which awaited his masterful use of it. A linotype could not be invented without all the preceding advance in paper-making, in development of written language, block-printing, the use of fire, the perfec- tion of metallurgy and chemistry, the dis- covery of the principles of the wheel, the lever, the screw, the pulley, etc. And these are age-long achievements. So that the genius, as he becomes known to us by his work, is in no sense self-sufficient. Rob him of the motivating influence of the times in which he lives and of the heritage of materials with which to work, and what seems to us a very simple thing, say the discovery of the wheel principle, be- comes difficult enough to challenge his powers. Burr ("Genius," in Medical Searchlight, March i 5, 19z6) is free to grant the appellation to the first user of fire, to the innovator who produced the marvel- ously delicate harpoon adjustment of the Eskimo, or to the inventor of the bow and feathered arrow (if we may assume these to be the work of only one person). Further, in the very complex culture and in cases where groups of diverse culture have to work out an accommodation to each other, there result of necessity many new combinations of the old and the new, many necessities for re-analysis, interbor- rowings, adaptations, re-combinations and the like which explain much of cultural change. Thus, as one has pointed out, the invention of the locomotive focussed atten- tion on satisfactory trackage until the steel rail resulted; the greater speed then possible focussed attention on safer brakes until the Westinghouse brake was devised; satisfactory couplers had to be found; sig- naling devices; etc., one innovation focus- ing the attention on the necessity for another until we have the tremendously intricate complex of culture traits which our modern railroads represent. Thus in the sciences, biology had gotten to the point where a next logical step was in order; and Spencer, Wallace, and Darwin hit upon the evolutionary theory, in slightly different forms, almost simulta- neously. Ogburn (Social Change) gives a list Of I48 significant scientific theories and inventions which have been mnade inde- pendently by two or more men and so nearly simultaneously that the question as to who were their first originators is still a matter of dispute. The above facts-the motivating influ- ence of his times upon the great man, the reliance of the innovator upon the already accumulated heritage with which to work, and the tendency for cultural change to demand further change-have led to an- other unilateral theory quite the opposite of the 'great man' theory, that of cultural determinism. The proponents of this the- ory hold that the great man is but the medium through which the developments of his times express themselves, that he is</page><page sequence="4">BIOLOGICAL VARIATE AND CULTUR E 13 more influenced by the group than he influ- ences it, that in so far as he does influence the group it is the result only of the group's prior influence on him. He is thus an instrument of the group and mean- ingless in himself. Did not this particular leader occur, another would have been thrown up by the group. Now all this may be admitted without detracting in the least from the importance to cultural advance of the genius and the superior as we have depicted it a few pages back. That is, no one would now posit the individual genius as an original cause. It still remains true that five per cent of the group do the real thinking for the whole group. Lacking the particular genius who was promoted to leadership, it may be true that the group influences would focus in some other. But-and here is the first stumbling block-suppose it didn't. For, since geniuses are rare birds, suppose there is no other genius at hand. The answer is that the changes would have to come about as the result of the slow trial and error accretions at the hands of the medi- ocre and the dull or as the result of the but slightly more rapid accretions from the merely bright, instead of in the bolder strokes of the genius. The synthesis of the two opposed theo- ries is then this: the group furnishes the superior variate with the cultural heritage, the material without which he could not work; the times in which he lives in one way or another condition the direction of his motivation and in a measure also its intensity; and current and preceding changes (or changes in the physical envi- ronment) direct his attention to specific problems and tasks. But it is because he is a superior variate that he attacks them more vigorously and sketches his answers in bold strokes which often have about them a compelling power in contrast to the stinted trial and error accretions which generations of mediocrity finally grind out. So that, granted that group influences have had the major share in determining the specific content of his contributions, his influence upon the rate of their achievement, and doubtless also on their pat-ness, is enough to warrant looking upon him as a distinct factor. But besides this it is true that as leader and innovator there accrues to him a pres- tige and a following which gives to the single personality a formative influence upon the group, an influence which is quite absent in the anonymity of the slower trial and error accretions of which the cultural determinists speak. It there- fore does not follow that, in his absence and with some other superior 'deputized' as the group's instrument, things would go on in exactly the same manner. And here biological factors may give a qualitative tone to the results. For example, in tem- perament there may be all the difference between Buddha and Mohammed, between Ghandi and Mussolini; and with these differences go differences in the tone of the times, of the institutions and philosophies set up, and in the ensuing cultural develop- ment. And the question is raised by the occurrence of men like Bach and Chopin and some of the mathematical geniuses as to whether there may not be more speci- ficity in other than temperamental aspects in biological inheritance than is usually supposed. There have long been recognized the literary genius, the artistic genius, the musical genius, the religious mystic, etc., and there is no reason to prescribe the realms in which genius mnay find expres- sion, though this is not the place to dis- cuss the specificity of talent. People of outstanding talent along special lines have unquestionably occurred, though usually accompanied by a high general endow- ment. Among such are the mathematical</page><page sequence="5">14 SOCIAL FORCES prodigies, musical geniuses, and the like. Recently we are inclined to broaden the category of genius to include inventive geniuses, military, personal leadership (statesmen or even criminals), and organ- izing and executive superiors. The impor- tance of the contributions of each is apparent. There have doubtless been many times and many problems which have awaited in vain the bold strokes of a leader of great competency. And contrariwise there have probably been many men of genius born into primitive groups (or held down in our own civilization by inequality of oppor- tunity) who, lacking the materials with which to work or the motivation or direc- tion of their attention upon a task com- mensurate with their ability, have died without ever yielding to society the con- tribution of which they were capable. But when the opportunity and the man have been happily combined, biological factors have afforded a considerable hasten- ing of otherwise slow cultural processes, and the individuality of the superior inno- vator has not been entirely escaped as an influence. None can doubt, for instance, that the history of Greek culture and with it that of most subsequent culture would have been different in the absence of the sixth centuey efflorescence of genius. Athens, with less than ioo,OOO population, produced, from 53o B.C. to 43o B.C. full fourteen geniuses of the first water. One is bold to say that without the Greek geniuses of about this period, science and philosophy and most technology might be little more advanced in Europe today than it was a thousand years ago. For it was in the renaissance of Greek learning, car- ried on in the Aristotelian-Nestorian-Sar- acenic continuity, that science and phi- losophy revived in Europe after a thousand years of the deadening hand of Christian scholasticism and censorship. What we have thus far said applies also to the gradation from 'sanity' to insanity. Genius and eccentricity have ever been thought to be closely allied. And while more accurate methods of study are teach- ing us that the superior variate is usually a more healthy general picture than is the mediocre or backward, the emotionial com- plications of mildly morbid variates some- times yield an intensity of motivation and a richness of emotional life which ranks them close to the true genius in the extent of their influence, and which, when com- bined with high mental ability, often yields contributions of unique worth, especially in literary, artistic, and mystico- religious fields. Thus the mild depressives and neurotics have expressed their doubt- ing phobias and feelings of unreality in analyzing what to the ordinary man are fixed orientation points of thinking and belief; and philosophy would be much the poorer without them. Hypomanics, be- cause of the intensity of their motivation, the grandiosity of their schemes, and the confidence which their self-confidence sometimes inspires in others, have played decidedly important roles in political, military, religious, and industrial leader- ship. Paranoiacs and hysterics have played, and continue to play, a part out of proportion to their numnbers in religion; and many of the shamans, oracles, medi- ums, prophets, messiahs, and saints would today be diagnosed as pathological in the clinic. Mild manic-depressives have in- creased the gamut, and enriched the wealth of expression, of the emotions in all artistic fields and, in their manic phases, have sometimes accomplished prodigious tasks. Paranoid and paretic rulers have more adventitiously affected the vicissitudes of empire and with it the vicissitudes of political, commercial, and cultural domi- nance. While at the other extreme all sorts of personality twists and all degrees</page><page sequence="6">BIOLOGICAL VARIATE AND CULTURE of feeble-mindedness are involved with more intelligent and normal elements in the problems of crime, prostitution, per- version, and rebel groupings. To be sure, it may be said here, as of the superior in competency, that the specific picture which the aberrant presents is usually a group-conditioned affair. That the biological differentia are important, however, goes without saying. For al- most all have had similar experiences, but in not nearly all has the aberrant syndrome developed. The exact role of physical factors and factors of experience is in con- troversy and furnishes a fundamental dif- ference in the approach of two schools of psychiatry. But it suffices for our purpose to point out that biologically variant fac- tors are involved and that significant social results follow. Let us now turn our attention from the individual variate to the characteristics of the group as a whole. It is at once obvious that, under given conditions, a group whose general average of intel- ligence is higher will progress more rapidly. There will be more thought-out innovations; they will profit by experience more rapidly and increase the rapidity of fortuitous trial and error accretions; when a cross-fertilization of diverse cultures occurs, they will work out adaptations more readily and the adaptations and new combinations hit upon are apt to be better; and they can more readily grasp and follow the teachings of men of genius in their own and other groups. For intelligence is definable as plasticity, adaptability, the ability to solve new problems, the ability to combine familiar elements in new con- figurations which are at once novel, origi- nal, and pat. And, just as history shows us crises and problems which have suffered for lack of a leader competent to solve them, so it also shows us great men who lived 'before their time,' whose contribu- tions were lost for lack of a following, for lack of a group who, if they could not themselves throw up this achievement, could at least grasp, appreciate, and trans- mit it. Indeed the history of genius is largely one of posthumous glory. In his lifetime, the genius has often as not suf- fered in poverty from the neglect of a gen- eration who could not grasp and appreciate him; or he has faced ostracism, the cup of hemlock, the torturing rack, or, more lat- terly, political imprisonment. To be sure, the indifference of the group to the inno- vator is complicated by the opposition of vested interests-the Athenians whose leadership was imperiled by Socrates, the Israelitish priests whose tenure was threat- ened by the new teaching, the Roman Church which saw peril to itself in the independent thinking of science, and diverse modern groups who oppose inno- vations in religion, ethics, and the politi- cal and economic order. But over and above this, there is sometimes the lack of even a nucleus to grasp, appreciate, and transmit; and sometimes the contribution is utterly lost. Thus Iknaton, who flour- ished in the Eighteenth Dynasty at the beginning of the Egyptian Empire period, arrived at a lofty conception of mono- theism fully thirteen or fourteen centuries B.C., a conception so in contrast to the current anthropomorphism that, although he was able to force a certain fleeting acceptance, it died out utterly at his death. Breasted has referred to Iknaton as the first man known to history who stood out distinctly above the culture of his time. The importance of the mental level of the group as a whole can thus not be ques- tioned, both in its influence on the rate of chance advances and in its influence upon the influence of the really superior variate. Perhaps even more important than the average level of the group is the variability of the group, that is, the extent to which</page><page sequence="7">i6 SOCIAL FORCES atypical members are produced. For the presence of the undesirable variants (idiots and imbeciles, e.g.) is more than offset by the superior variants whom we have seen to be in a very real sense the salt of the earth. Thus a group whose average com- petency is somewhat lower than a second group may still be in the more favorable position for progress if the range of its vari- ability affords a nucleus for advance in the few geniuses and superiors; that is, if the second group, although having the higher average, has little variability, so that none of its members depart far either way from mediocrity. This opens the way to a theory of culture differences as due to the innate ability of the groups concerned-the possible rela- tion of race to culture. We shall not go into it further here. But we should bear in mind the upshot of most discussion of that subject-that thus far the racial factor is so entangled within itself and with other factors, environmental advantages and handicaps, isolation from or accessi- bility to the main current of cultural progress, and historical vicissitudes, that we can say absolutely nothing about it with certainty. Another theory for which we have some current proof is the effect of changes in the level of group competency from time to time. Various studies have shown that the more competent groups in present day society (and especially the college gradu- ates) do not have as many children as do groups of lesser competency and lower living standards (especially the unskilled laborers). Indeed, some studies show the college graduate not even to be maintain- ing his numbers from generation to genera- tion while large families characterize the disorganized and the inadequate. And in modern society we have all sorts of charities to help the incompetent live and multiply. If one take, as a speculative example, the lower I0 per cent in the army tests, inferior to go per cent, admit say I0,000,000 of them in the general popula- tion, and grant them four children brought to maturity by each married couple, which would be a conservatively small number; if he then take the upper I0 per cent, supe- rior to go per cent, admit io,ooo,ooo in the general population, and grant them three children brought to maturity by each mar- ried pair, which would be a conservatively high number; then at the expiration of two centuries the proportion of quite inferior to quite superior is no longer ten to ten, but the inadequates outnumber the supe- riors i6o to io! That is, in a competitive society, standard of living, the mark and pride of a high culture, seems to set up influences that tend to make civilization self-destructive. Just as, according to Gresham's law in economics, bad money drives out good, so a bad standard of liv- ing, and with it bad biological stock, tends to drive out good. The eugenists have applied this to his- tory and have sought in this element thc explanation of the periodicity of civiliza- tional advance and decline which has characterized the past. They have found evidences of differential birth rates in various ancient societies. To this factor has been added the influence of war as skimming off the cream and leaving the inadequates behind with the women, to become the fathers of the future genera- tions. Although in any specific case this factor is entangled with all the multi- plicity of factors we have seen to permeate all social problems, on a priori grounds alone a strong case can be made for it. The social scientist cannot avoid a deep antagonism to war; also to teachings (such as those of the Roman Church), and to legislative measures which would stand in the way of applying to the full such biological knowledge as we may acquire</page><page sequence="8">BIOLOGICAL VARIATE AND CULTURE as to how to obtain more of the superior variates and how to prevent the inferiors from ever being born. Given eugenical measures of birth control, our charities become ethical and humanitarian in the finest sense; without such measures, they remain but sentimentalized mechanisms for insuring civilizational retardation. When one ponders the importance of the general level of competency and the impor- tance of the superior variate to civiliza- tional advance, he can readily understand why an increasing body of proponents has arisen for eugenics. The eugenists hope to gain sufficient biological knowledge (which is what is most needed) and suffi- cient appreciation of the importance of preventing that out-breeding of intelli- gence and its replacement by inferior stock which seems now to be in progress, to enable us ultimately to reverse the present process, that is, to replace poor human stock with superior strains, perhaps ulti- mately to raise the average of the whole group to the level of the highest member. One can scarcely visualize the force which cultural change would take on if every age were marked by the efflorescence of genius which characterized Greece of the Golden Age, if every town of ioo,ooo matched the first water geniuses of sixth century Athens, if every member of society were a Nietszche, an Einstein, a Lincoln, a Beethoven, an Edison, and a Shakespeare rolled into one. So rosy is the picture of transformation which a successful eugen- ical program would bring about that we are apt to overlook the fact that what is most needed at the present is more bio- logical knowledge. It is theoretically conceivable that the above could be ac- complished; but much research and educa- tion of the public is needed before even a modest eugenical program can be put into effect. And even then we must not look for a panacea. Not all problems would be solved by a thorough eugenical program. But one can say truthfully that neither will any major problem be completely solved without it. This matter of the level of intelligence in the general group is of considerable sig- nificance for the future. For it bears on three catch-words which, perhaps validly, have come to have considerable sanctity in current appraisal, namely democracy, lib- erty and progress. One does not have to look far to see that democracy is still an experiment, still in the proving stage. Witness the way in which its ends are defeated by indifference and ignorance, by graft, by propaganda, demogoguery, and by forceful and silken control manipulated by minority groups who have usurped power; by the way in which ignorance, propaganda, and crowd-mindedness made pawns of the populations in the recent war and set the most civilized countries at each other's throats; by the way the pocket- book sensitivity of the tax-payer blocks immediately expensive but distantly eco- nomical and constructive measures. Equally cogent with the question, 'Is the world safe for democracy?' is the reverse question, "Is democracy yet safe for the world?'. In terms of immediate benefit, much could be said for benevolent monarchy. The difficulty is that the benevolent mon- archy does not stay benevolent. Without implying any moral censure, it is true that the only context in which one can judge a situation is the context of his own mental associations, which is shot through with his own experiences, his own likes and dis- likes, interests, and desires. The result is that, in time, the controlling group inevi- tably come to decide actions and policies which affect the whole group in terms of their own interests. The sheer line of least resistance makes it unavoidable, and the procedure usually becomes so covered up</page><page sequence="9">SOCIAL FORCES with rationalization and group pressures as to be even more of an effective tendency. Thus in history domination has always led to exploitation. History is as eloquent on this point as on probably any other. It is witnessed by the exploitation of women by the dominant male, especially in the Orient, by the oppression of submerged groups by ruling dynasties, castes, and classes all down through history, and by the instance of the Church, which at the time of its greatest worldly power lent itself to as great abuses as are found else- where, in spite of a body of ideals and a paternalistic tradition which would lead one to expect a different result in its case. It is because, over and above deliberate abuses, the line of least resistance tends to made the exercise of power verge steadily toward abuse of power, that we look upon democracy as the 'ultimate' form of social organization, that is, as nearly ultimate as any we can now apprehend. And this is true, not merely in the political sense but in broader fields, e.g., industrial democ- racy, which is the bone of present contention. But democracy is doubtful of existence in the presence of ignorance, bias, crowd- mindedness, etc., all of which are depend- ent upon the group competency level in some degree. Equality of opportunity is meaningless if there remain any wide inequality of competency. Pro-rate the wealth of the land equally to all inhabi- tants and a decade hence, perhaps even a year hence, the greatest inequalities would be again apparent. Democracy, in its finest definition, is the right of partici- pation in the control of any situation on the part of every individual who will be influenced by that control and in propor- tion to the extent to which he is affected. But the practicability of this depends upon the ability of the individual to so partici- pate. And this depends upon the innate competency and the background of train- ing. Without these, the democratized populace will, in its gullibleness, become but pawns in the control of usurping sub- groups, will, in its ignorance and lack of ability to deal with complicated matters and distant considerations, ruin the group by unwise and short-sighted decisions, or, in its emotionality and crowd-mindedness, will sweep it to its destruction. Looking to the future of democracy, then, society is met with a two-fold obligation: first, the development of some sort of eugenical measures to prevent the births of inferiors and raise the level of the general group up to that of the highest members in point of competency; and second, the development of a educational and social system plastic enough and of enough justice, not only to permit, but to draw out, the highest de- veloptnent of the abilities possessed through the range of the whole population. What we have said of democracy applies in a measure also to liberty. Let us turn from political liberty, then, to more subtle forms; intellectual liberty, ethical liberty, spiritual liberty. The justification for not permitting everyone to decide for them- selves what they shall believe and teach, what they 'ought' and 'ought not' to do, and what values they shall hold as supreme and self-sufficient, is that not everyone can be trusted with such decisions. Hence society decides for them; and customs, traditions, codes, creeds, and institutions hold the average individual more firmly than he ever realizes from the possibility of independence in these matters. Indeed, the liberated individual who has arrived at decidedly different conclusions, even though succeeding generations may con- firm his wisdom, often enough faces the cross or the scaffold for his sheer lack of conformity. Rightly, traditions, creeds, and the like should exert no effect upon thought and action; for the tradition or</page><page sequence="10">BIOLOGICAL VARIATE AND CULTURE creed may be wrong in spite of its vener- able antiquity. Witness the long survival of the Mosaic cosmogeny, of the institu- tion of slavery, of the divine right of kings, of the various religions (excepting for purposes of argument whichever one you may personally believe in), with their mass of supe,rstition. Rather, each case (and every case is unique) should be de- cided on the basis of its individual char- acteristics (rather than by generalizations laid down by those of former timnes), and thought and action should be conformed only by reality (as shown in the particular situation, and as depicted in the light of reason). But this involves intelligence, the ability to analyze, discriminate, and take into consideration distant ramifica- tions; and it involves an emotional sta- bility and a personality integration such as will insure control of behavior in ac- cordance with deliberative judg-ment. Very few indeed are those who, let loose in a world in which there were no arbi- trary restrictions on thought and action, could function wisely in each independent situation as it arose, unguided by tradition and.the herd voice, guided only by estab- lished fact and reason. Hence there is a justification for the existence and observ- ance of the group morality even when the ethicist can see no intrinsic merit in any of its standards. And actually almost every group known to us, except perhaps a few highly selected scientific and philo- sophic circles, are so thoroughly bound in their thought and action that they are not even aware of it, but resent diversity as if it were intrinsically wrong or unnatural. The resulting denial of liberty in its more subtle forms to the liberated indi- vidual competent to think for himself, competent to cut loose from the moorings of tradition and chart new seas, is sad to behold and grievious to experience. Yet until all are of equal and very high com- petency, the necessity for binding rules is equally apparent. It can be shown by a simple illustration. For instance, in a certain citv there is a law that. autos may not go down a certain street more than eight miles per hour. Could every driver be trusted to use good judgment this would not be necessary. The driver might then go twenty or even fifty miles an hour at certain times of the day (or whenever he saw a clear stretch ahead such that this speed was safe). And he could be trusted to throttle down to four miles an hour or actually to stop if the thoroughfare were dangerously crowded or if there were chil- dren playing. But because all drivers can- not be trusted to be so alert and to use such good judgment a uniform rule is made that no driver may exceed eight miles per hour. Thus the competent driver is denied the freedom he is quite capable of exercising wisely, because of the necessity of giving a uniform rule to those who cannot decide separate cases on their own merits. Now the situation is exactly analogous in the more subtle fields of beliefs, moralities, and values. So that, not only is the gen- eral group not free, since it spends most of its life learning to follow prescriptions instead of diagnosing and acting for itself, but also the superior is not free, because to think for himself is to violate what comes to be inflexible, even sacred cotn- formities. God himself could not be free among us as we are now. Yet every scientist will tell you that scientific ad- vance depends upon complete freedom of thought and discourse, every ethicist will tell you that prescription-following mo- rality is the antithesis of true ethics, and the more catholic religionists will agree that one's Supreme Value and his scale of values must be his very own to have com- pelling power. Democracy in the sense of social democracy rather than political</page><page sequence="11">2o SOCIAL FORCES or industrial democracy and liberty in the subtler connotations of intellectual lib- erty, ethical liberty, spiritual liberty even, wait then and will continue to wait upon a high general level of competency and full development of the innate abilities. But it is not only that liberty, however priceless that may be, is withheld. With the lack of freedom goes the loss of originality in thought and action, the loss to culture of original contributions, the maintenance of hide-bound traditional fallacies, goes, relatively at least, cultural stagnation. The superior variate, easily able wisely to cut loose from the moorings of tradition, custom, and creed, and to venture forth upon the open sea in new voyages of discovery and conquest, may not do so or pays the price of his non-con- formity if he does. Thus 'progress,' another current fetich, suffers. We shall not attempt to say what constitutes progress. We shall leave it go as probably substantiable that intelligent people of emotional stability and integrated per- sonalities are more apt to choose standards which will conduce to it than are feeble- minded and insane defectives. This, added to our earlier discussion of the rela- tion of the level of group competency to the rate of innovation, the rate of diffu- sion, and the patness of adaptations and new combinations of cultural elements, is sufficient to show the dependence of prog- ress upon group competency. The meagreness of our biological knowl- edge on the matter of eugenics and the difficulties in the way of instituting eugen- ical programs and changing educational systems we have only suggested. It is sufficient for our purpose here to show that human culture is influenced by certain bio- logical factors; the individual variate, superior, inferior, and aberrant; the gen- eral level of competency of the group as a whole; and the range of variation within the group. These impinge upon and work in functional interdependence with changes in the physical environment and the 'self-contained' culture process-inno- vation, accumulation, diffusion, recombina- tion. The social implications are impor- tant enough to warrant society in looking to its biological heritage, to conserve and improve it by active measures. It is anomaly and paradox to put forth as 'moral' or 'religious' objections to so im- portant a human venture.</page></plain_text>
