Laboratoire des Chocs et de Biomecanique ABSTRACT During the phase IV of the EEC biomecha- nical programme, the available side impact dummies were evaluated and this work concluded that none of the dummy was acceptable. The European Experimental Vehicle Committee set up a working group to built a new side impact dummy to be used in a standard side impact test. The ONSER laboratory was in charge of the development of the pelvis. This paper in- cludes the specifications for the pelvis, agreed by the EEVC working group dealing with this subject, anthropometric analysis to choo- se sizes and mass distribution a description of the shape of the pelvic bone and the loca- tion and the type of transducer (force, acce- leration). The design of the hip joint and the use of deformable materials to simulate the pelvic bone deformations are discussed. Re- sults of impactor tests using a dummy fitted with this pelvis are analyzed and their re- sults compared to those of cadavers tests con- ducted previously. The results of these first tests seem promising and have be completed es- pecially to validate the repeatabil ity and the durability. IN 1982, THE WORKING GROUP N° 6 OF THE EUROPEAN EXPERIMENTAL VEHICLE COMMITTEE (EEVC) concluded in a full scale test procedure for side impact (1)*. The report of this working group shows a need for an improved side impact dummy. During the years 1980 to 1982 the Euro- pean Economic Community (EEC) sponsored a bio- mechanical research programme (2) which inclu- ded researches dealing with side impact dum- mies. (*) Numbers in parentheses designate referen- ces at end of paper. In this field the comparison of the four avai- lable side impact dummies which were the DOT/SID (3), the APROD (4), the MIRA SID (5) and the ONSER SID (6) showed that none of them was acceptable at their present stage of deve- lopment. For these reasons, the EEVC decided in 1983 to create an ad hoc working group res- ponsible for building an European Side Impact Dummy which is called EUROSID. This dummy has to be mainly used in the integrated side impact test with the EEVC mo- bile deformable barrier. The general specifi- cations and the design requirements adopted by the EEVC side impact dummy ad hoc groupe were reported recently by NEILSON (7) and our labo- ratory was in charge of the development of the pelvis and upper femur area of the EUROSID. MAIN SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE PELVIS OF THE EUROSID DUMMY The Euros i d pelvis was designed to follow the EEVC side impact dummy ad hoc group speci- fications and to integrate research results in the field of biomechanics and of anthropometry. The pelvis specially studied for the Euros i d has to attach to the legs of the Part 572 at the level of the upper extremities of the femur force transducer and to the torso at the lower extremity of the Part 572 lumbar spine ; it will be compatible with the abdomen of the Euros i d developed by TNO. The external shape of the pelvic bone will be realistic and especially it must be representative of the shape of the human pel- vis at the points directly involved in a side impact and at the interactions with the car seat as well as at the iliac crests where the seat belt fits around the pelvis. Its design will consider the deformation capability of the pelvic bones as well as of the flesh. 6.738 0096-736X/ 85/ 9306-0738$02 • 50 Copyright 1983 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">The motion capability of the femurs rela- tively to the pelvis is considered of great importance and an abduction of 30° seems the value to be considered in the design of the hip joint. Pelvic transversal force is considered as the injury related parameter to be recorded. However the Euros id will allow to measure pel- vic acceleration if possible at the same loca- tion as on the Part 572 dummy. The mass dis- tribution between the bone and the flesh seems of great importance ; however the skeletal mass would take into account the mass of the abdominal contents located inside the pelvis. The flesh in the area at the side of the pel- vis liable to be struck should be sufficient to comply with the likely requirements and sufficiently durable that it should not dete- riorate significantly during many impacts. DESIGN OF THE EUROSID PELVIS The first part of the design is the se- lection of anthropometric data defining the sizes and the shapes of the several elements constituting the pelvis design. The geometry of the pelvis girdle was analyzed by REYNOLDS and al (8) and this study was followed by a plaster model of the 50th percentile male pelvis. This pelvic model has been sent to several research laboratories by NHTSA and the shape of the Eurosid pelvic bo- nes is based on this model. Figure 1 shows the Eurosid pelvic bone and the human pelvis mo- del. The external shape and the important points such as the pubic symphysis, the H point, the center of LI are in the same loca- tions on the Eurosid pelvis as on the human pelvis model. The hip articulation of the Eurosid pel- vis is voluntary different from the human one : to minimize the effect of the leg posi- tion on the pelvis loading, the external forces are transmitted to the pelvis along an axle passing through the hip ball joint, as show on figure 2. With this design the thigh position has no effect on the way in which an impact on the great trochanter loads the pelvis but an impact on the thigh loads the pelvis at the same point as on humans. Previous tests with cadavers showed a much lower impact force than the same tests performed with dummies, the difference in res- ponse being mainly due to a too low energy absorbtion by the dummies pelvis. To increase the energy absorbtion capability the Eurosid pelvis has the part of the flesh, which is di- rectly compressed by the impact, made from Sorbothane. This material is one of the two possible ones selected to simulate human flesh (9).

CESARI, ET AL. Fig. 1 : Eurosid pelvis bone and human pelvis model Fig. 3 : Eurosid pelvis : open view Figure 3 is an open view of the Eurosid pelvis showing the block of Sorbothane fixed to the hip plate. The sorbothane is a polyurethan ha- ving a great hysteresis capability, which is able to absorb up to 80 % of the impact energy. From a standing position to a sitting one the human pelvis rotates. In a standing posi- tion the plane passing through the two iliac crests and the pubic symphysis is almost ver- tical. This plane is called pelvic reference plane. In a sitting position the pubic symphy- sis goes forward, but the rotation angle va- ries in a large amount ; however the average seems to be about 30° (10) and this value was kept in the design of the Eurosid pelvis. By comparison the pelvic reference plane of the Part 572 dummy makes an angle of 22 to 27° with the vertical . The Eurosid pelvis can be mounted on a Part 572 dummy. The interfaces are the lower extremity of the lumbar spine and the mid thigh at the upper extremity of the femur for- ce transducers. The external shape of the Eurosid pelvis component is the same as the external shape of the Part 572 pelvis area. The Eurosid pelvis is designed to measure pelvic lateral compressive forces. For this purpose the pelvis is fitted with three force transducers as indicated on figure 2 : one is located at the pubic symphysis and the two other between the iliac wing and the sacrum. The three force transducers associated with the specific design of hip joint make that forces applying to the thigh and/or through the great trochanter are loading the pelvis and are recorded by the three pelvic force transducers as well as the forces applying to the iliac wing. To allow the comparison of tests results conducted with the Eurosid and with other dummies, it is possible to fit the Eurosid pelvis with a triaxial accelerometer at the same location as it is on Part 572 dum- my. The design of the hip joint allow an ab- duction angle of about 25° ; the same angle can be reached in an adduction motion. However it seems that as the same part constitutes the flesh in pelvis area and of the two thigh upper extremities, the adduction and abduction angles will be limited by the deformation of capability of the foam in this area. At the junction with the lumbar spine a 3 cm thick rigid block is screwed to the sa- crum. This block could be replaced by a force transducer if in the future this seems neces- sary. At its present stage of development the weight of the pelvis is about 12 kg with 8,71 kg for the metallic parts (skeleton) and 3,31 kg for the foam and the sorbothane. As the mass of the metallic part has to simulate the mass of the skeleton and the mass of the abdominal contents included inside the pelvis, this mass distribution seems acceptable. This pelvis has to be used with the side impact upper abdomen developed by TNO and the weight of this abdomen is 4,66 kg, the total weight pelvis and abdomen will be 18,14 kg, which is approximately the same weight as the Part 572 dummy one.</page><page sequence="4">PELVIS DESIGN FOR IMPACT DUMMY 6.741 The weight distribution of pelvic parts of Eurosid and of Part 572 dummies are listed in table 1. The values included in these ta- bles show that the most important difference concerns the abdomen : the weight of the TNO abdomen fitting the Eurosid is much higher than the weight of the Hybrid II dummy abdo- men ; however the improvement of the TNO abdo- men is expected to conclude in a lighter design. According to the anthropometric study conducted by McConville (11) the total weight of the pelvis, the abdomen and the lumbar spi- ne would be 19.54 kg split between 17.32 kg for the pelvis and the spine and 2.22 kg for the abdomen. These values are calculated from the values of body segment volumes multiplied by the density of each specific body segment and the figures are in agreement with the values proposed by Robbins (12) in the study of seated posture of Vehicle occupants. The mass of the pelvis of the Eurosid will be ad- justed after the final design of the abdomen, by adding ballast masses, if necessary, close to the center of gravity of the pelvis.

We have conducted a serie of 8 tests at 4 different speeds (25, 30, 35 and 40 km/h) with the same impactor used for cadaver tests. In these tests we recorded : - on the impactor : impact force, impactor acceleration, impactor speed, - on the dummy : triaxial pelvic acceleration, pelvic force on the three force transducers. The results of these tests are in table 2. In order to investigate the response of the pelvis in a situation closer to what sus- tains a car occupant in a car to car side im- pact test, we have completed the validation tests with a serie of impactor tests in which the impacting area is a triangle applying on the pelvic area and on the thigh (fig. 4). Fig. 4 : Test with triangular impactor This specific triangular impactor differs from the normal circular impactor in the loading surfaces of the pelvis. With the circular im- pactor the pelvis is directly loaded through the great trochanter, whereas the triangular one loads the body through a flat surface on the external surface of the thigh and on the pelvis at the great throcanther and at the iliac wing. The impactor forces are recorded in three points : one forward transducer loca- ted at the mid femur, one low rearward trans- ducer close to the lower extremity of the sa- crum and one up rearward one at the iliac crest area. Figure 5 shows the shape of the impactor extremity and the results of these tests are included in table 3. Fig. 5 : Triangular impactor related to Euro- sid pelvis</page><page sequence="5">6.742 D.

Tests results - Figures 6 and 7 give the values of pelvic force as a function of the impact speed. For each test the lowest value of pelvic force was recorded on the force transducer lo- cated at the lower sacrum, and the highest va- lue on upper sacrum transducer. If we analyse the traces (see appendix) we can note that the shape of the the lower sacrum force has a time history different from those of the two other transducers. During a test, the impacted side pelvis shell is pushed inside the pelvis and load the force transducers ; this gives a translation to the pelvis, but as the pelvis is connected to the upper body through the lumbar spine, the upper body is also driven, and by inertia effect, there is a tendency to incline the sa- crum. This motion results in over loading the upper transducer and under loading the lower, whereas the pubic force transducer is not affected. For this reason, it seems that the value recorded by the pubic force transducer has to be considered first. If we consider the pubic force these fi- gures show a great sensitivity of this parame- ter to the increasing of the impactor speed. When the impactor speed goes from 25 to 40 km/h the maximum of the pubic force is in- creased by 260 %. This is important as in side impact, the speed of the side panel at the time of contact with the occupant is the parameter which is considered related to the severity of the impact, and the motion of this side panel is simulated by the impactor. On figure 8 we have plotted the maximum values of pubic force in the two series of impactor tests and the values of maximum and 3 ms pelvic acceleration in test with circular impactor as a function of impactor maximun force. Analysis of these results shows a good linear correlation for pubic force in the two impact conditions and for maximum pelvic acce- leration.</page><page sequence="6">PELVIS DESIGN FOR IMPACT DUMMY 6.743 Force " (N) / T / r = O.956 50000 ■ / / FUS •/ r/= O.97I 40000 . / / 30000 - / /' y " F 20000 f / P / / = °i963 10000 // fls 20 30 40 sPeed (km/h) Fy = Total pelvic force FUS = Upper sacrum force Fp = Pubic force Fls = Lower sacrum force Fig. 6 : Pelvic forces versus impact speed.

Circular impac- tor. 3 = Pubic force. Circular impactor. 4 = Pubic force. Triangular impactor. The 3 ms pelvic acceleration which has been proposed as a tolerance criterion for pelvis (14) is badly correlated to the impactor force. From the tests results it is possible to determine the apparent mass of the body which sustains the impact. During the test all the energy of the impactor is transmitted to the dummy the momentun equilibrium is then : mi .Vļ = mp.Vp in which m-j is the impactor mass (constant, equal to 17.3 kg in all tests), Vļ is the impactor speed at the impact, known by measu- rement, mp is the apparent mass of the pel- vis and Vp is the speed of the pelvis at the end of the impact. The speed of the pelvis can be calculated by integration of the pelvic transverse acceleration : Vp = J j X ņ dt J o Table 4 includes the values of the pelvis ap- parent mass calculated for the nine tests with Fig. 9 : Impactor force versus impact speed (cadavers and dummies) Tests with circular impactor circular impactor. The values are included between 27 and 32.5 kg which represents 37 to 44.5 % of the whole body mass. The apparent mass increases with the impactor speed : in high impact speed tests, the pelvis sustains a greater acceleration and then the inerti al effect of the thigh and of the thorax is in- creased. The apparent mass of the body can also be calculated from the impact force value and pelvis acceleration. The equation is : Fi = Mp. X p or Mp = X p Using this equation the value found for Mp is about the half of the values of mp. This calculation considers the values of F-¡ and p at their maximum and this maximum occurs approximately 40 % earlier than the mo- ment of the maximum speed, and at this time a smaller part of the body is involved by the impact.</page><page sequence="8">PELVIS DESIGN FOR IMPACT DUMMY 6.745 Comparison with cadavers and other dum- mies - Series 5T tests have been conducted previously under the same conditions with ca- davers (13) and with side impact dummies (15), but all the dummy tests were conducted at the same impact speed which was 32 km/h. Figure 9 shows the variations of the maximum impactor force versus impact speed. Compared to cadavers the Euros i d pelvis tests correspond to a higher impactor force. The difference increases with the impact speed. Compared to other side impact dummies, the Euros i d pelvis shows a lower impactor force and especially a much better repeatability : with the Euros i d pelvis the 3 tests conducted at 35 km/h give an average impactor force of 21 140 N with a standard deviation of 1104 (5,23 %) whereas with the ONSER SID dummy the values are : Fi = 35200 N, SD = 2760 N (7,84 %), with the DOT SID : Fi = 27410 N, SD = 3500 N (12,75 %) and with the MIRA dum- my : FI = 30850 N, SD = 4630 N (15 %).

Tests with circular impactor the transverse pelvic acceleration. Figure 10 represents the maximum values of pelvic trans- verse acceleration of cadavers and side impact dummies relatively to impact speed. This figu- re shows clearly that the Eurosid pelvis sus- tained for a same impact speed a higher acce- leration than the cadavers but lower than the other side impact dummies. Moreover the repea- tability of results seems better for the Eurosid : for the 3 tests conducted at 35 km/h the average of maximum pelvic acceleration is 149.37 g and the corresponding standard devia- tion 4.96 g (3,3 %). For the other dummies the values vary from 4,88 % for the ONSER dummy to 9,93 % for DOT-SID. Figure 11 gives the values of maximum pelvic transverse acceleration as a function of maximum impactor force for the 9 circular impactor tests and the cadaver tests conducted previously. This figure shows that the relationship between pelvic acceleration and impactor force is the same for cadavers and for dummy tests, but however the scatter of cadaver test re- sults is higher. Also this figure shows that the values of pelvic acceleration and of im- pactor force are lower in cadaver tests than in dummy tests. Differences in impact response between cadavers and dummies can be related to local stiffness as well as to body apparent mass, and at its present stage of development, the lumbar spine of the Eurosid has not been redesigned to match humanlike response.

CESARI, ET AL. CONCLUSION A comparative study made with available side impact dummies has show that none of them has an acceptable impact response, and was followed by the set up of an EEVC ad hoc group in charge of coordinating the research to de- sign a new side impact dummy (EUROSID) to be used in a standard side impact test procedure. The EEVC dummy ad hoc group aggreed on specifications for the EUROSID and we were in charge of the design of the pelvis of this dummy. The new pelvis for the european side im- pact dummy is completely different from pelvis of other dummies except the external shape of the flesh. Its design includes new solutions especially at the hip area and allows to mea- sure transversal compressive forces. The first tests performed with a dummy fitted with this pelvis show that the compressive force recor- ded on the pelvis is directly related to the impact speed. Compared to cadavers the Eurosid pelvis gives higher injury parameters values but clearly lower than other side impact dummies. Evaluation of durability and repeatability needs a higher number of tests ; however the pelvis sustained 25 impacts at a speed range 25 to 40 km/h without any damage neither to the skeleton nor to the flesh, and 3 tests performed in the same conditions gave very close results.
