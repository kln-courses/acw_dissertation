<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Br?hmanical Triad from Kashmir and Some Related Icons Pratapaditya Pal Los Angeles County Museum of Art Brahma, Vishnu and Siva constitute the triad of epic-pur?nic Br?hmanism. Tradition ally, Brahma is said to be the creator; Vishnu, the preserver; and Siva, the destroyer. This division of labor is also asserted in the Ndamatapur?na, a Kashmiri text of about the eighth century, but because of the text's Vaishnava bias, the three are simply regarded as different aspects of Vishnu, the supreme deity.1 As in the rest of India, in Kashmir too, the two most important Br?hmanical sects developed around Vishnu and Siva, while Brahma remained more or less a passive figurehead, like a constitutional monarch. Indeed, so uncommon must have been his cult that the Nilamatapur?na discusses him only as an abstract concept. This is also evident from the art of Kashmir where we seldom come across individual representations of Brahma. But even less frequently do we see the triad represented together. In view of this, a Kashmiri relief, now in a private collection, becomes all the more significant. The center of the relief (Fig. 1) is occupied by a litiga or the phallic emblem of Siva. It is at once clear that the person who owned and worshipped the relief was very likely a Saiva. The base of the li?ga rises in several molded and recessed stages and is surmounted by the phallus. A somewhat realistic touch is added to the phallus by incised lines, but, otherwise, it is of the conventional variety. This abstract symbol of Siva is flanked by two figures who represent Brahma and Vishnu. Each of them is provided with four arms and one head, but in all other aspects the two images are significantly different. Regally attired and crowned, Vishnu is ac companied by two smaller figures who represent his personified attributes. The female on his right, symbolizing the mace (gad?), is known as Gad? n?ri, while the male on the left, personifying the wheel (cakra), is known as Cakrapurusha. Both are engaged in fanning their master with fly whisks. The two other emblems of Vishnu are the familiar lotus and the conch. Between the god's feet is the tiny effigy of the earth goddess. In contrast to Vishnu, Brahma is represented as an ascetic brahmin with one portion of his matted locks piled up on top of the head and the other cascading down the shoulders. The only ornaments he wears are rather large earrings, reminiscent of similar earrings worn by ascetics depicted in the Harwan tiles.2 His body is draped diagonally by a transparent garment, leaving his right shoulder and arm bare. The attributes in his right hands are considerably damaged but they appear to have been the lotus and the rosary. The emblems in his left hands are a staff (danda) and a waterspot (kamandalu). On either side of Fig. 1. Br?hmanical Triad, Kashmir, Early 8th century, Gray chlorite. Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Cedric Marks, New York. 33</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 2. Brahma, Kashmir, 7th century, Bronze, Mu seum f?r Indische Kunst, Berlin. his feet are two birds which represent the hamsa or goose, the mount of Brahma. It has already been asserted that the depiction of such triads is somewhat rare, and more fre quently in medieval Indian art, the three are por trayed together in what is known as the Lihgod bhavam?rti. This is, of course, an iconic type with a distinct Saiva bias for, in effect, Brahma and Vishnu are shown engaged in measuring the phallus of Siva. In the Kashmiri relief under discussion, the three deities appear to have been given equal importance, nor do we see the di dactic intent of the Lihgodbhavam?rti. It is in teresting to note that both in the N?lamatapur ?na and the Vishnudharmottarapur?na, Brahma is said to represent the s?ttvik aspect and Siva the t?masik aspect of the Vaishnavi Trinity, while Vishnu himself emphasizes the r?jasik aspect.3 Appropriately, therefore, Brahma is portrayed here as an ascetic, Vishnu as a princely figure, while the linga represents the material aspect. II The most unusual feature of the Brahma fig ure is the fact that he is given only one head. Generally, Brahma is portrayed with four heads which are said to represent the four vedas. It is further asserted that the four heads symbolize the four directions, thereby emphasizing Brahma's solar character. When exactly Brahma was given four heads is not clear, and in fact, originally he is said to have possessed five heads.4 One of his heads was cut off by Siva when Brahma con templated incest, presumably with his daughter Sarasvat?. Although not commonly represented in art, in certain textual descriptions Brahma is provided with one head only. According to the Vishnud harmottarapur?na,5 as Praj?pati, Brahma should possess only one head and four arms. A more detailed description occurs in the Agnipur?na where again Brahma has only one head.6 This description is identical with that prescribed for Praj?pati by Hem?dri.7 Praj?pati, it may be pointed out, is a synonym for Brahma; and in Vedic Br?hmanism, he figures as the most im portant epiphany of the deity.8 In view of the above, there seems little doubt that the well-known Berlin bronze (Fig. 2), identified hitherto as Siva-Lokesvara,9 really rep resents Brahma. Except for the fact that the principal right hand of the deity displays the gesture of reassurance (ahhayamudra), the figure is identical to that of Brahma in the triad. His other hands hold the rosary, the waterpot and the staff (danda), which are all prescribed em blems for the god. More difficult to explain are the four attendant figures, although it is tempt ing to identify them as the personifications of the four vedas. At any rate, there seems no reason to identify the figure as Siva-Lokesvara. No Buddhist text has yet been discovered that describes any such composite deity. In fact, Lokesvara imbibes so many traits of ?iva, both conceptually and icono graphically, that such an identification would be quite redundant. Moreover, some years ago, M. T. de Mallmann quite convincingly demon strated, with reference to other such images mis takenly identified as ?iva-Lokesvara, that the composite identification is untenable.10 But while in the other alleged images of Siva-Lokesvara the figure does display the erect phallus and the third eye, no such Saiva signs are visible in the Berlin image.11 34</page><page sequence="3">However, it is not unlikely that the Berlin bronze was affiliated with Buddhism rather than Br?hmanism. The dedicatory inscription on the base begins with the expression deya dharmeya which is more characteristic of Buddhist conse cratory formulae than Br?hmanical. There need be nothing unusual in the inclusion of Brahma in the Buddhist pantheon. In early Buddhist myth ology Brahma is frequently mentioned playing a subservient role to the Buddha. And, in Gand h?ran art, he is portrayed as an ascetic brahmin and without multiple heads. Indeed, both icono graphically as well as stylistically, the Berlin bronze Brahma seems a further development of the figure flanking the Buddha in the Kanishka reliquary.12 Finally, in the T?ntric Buddhist text, Nishpannayog?valty Brahma is included in the Buddhist pantheon in his own right and is pro vided with one head rather than four.13 There are at least two other representations of Brahma known in Kashmiri art. One of these, now in the Srinagar Museum (Fig. 3), is a frag mentary though impressive example probably of the late eighth or early ninth century.14 The god is now provided with the usual multiple heads and only the staff can be recognized in one of the left hands. The garment is treated very much in the same manner as in the Berlin bronze and the animal skin flung across the left shoulder is common to both. It may be pointed out that while both Siva and Brahma sport animal skins, Siva's is that of a tiger and Brahma's that of a black buck. Moreover, generally in Kashmiri Siva images the skin is draped around his waist, but in those of Brahma, it is flung across the shoul der. In the stone Brahma the loop of his sacred thread is delineated above his left knee. An addi tional feature of both the Berlin Brahma and the Srinagar example is the large garland that comes down almost to the ankle. It may be men tioned that this garland does not appear as an adornment of the Brahma in the triad. More over, such a garland, while textually prescribed only for Vishnu and known as vanam?l?, is fre quently given to Siva in Kashmir, and may thus be regarded as a local iconographie addition. The remaining representation of Brahma oc curs in the magnificent bronze frame published some years ago by Hermann Goetz.15 There the god with multiple heads is shown seated cross legged on a lotus whose stem emerges from Vishnu's navel. Apart from the posture and the multiple heads, the figure is not unlike that in Fig. 3. Brahma, Kashmir, 9th century, Gray chlorite, Sri Pratap Singh Mu seum, Srinagar. (Photograph, The American Academy of Benares.) the Berlin bronze, and here too Brahma's princi pal right hand displays the abhayamudr?. Ill The representation of Vishnu in the triad seems to follow almost verbatim the description given in the Vishnudharmapur?na.16 In the rele vant verse Vishnu is said to possess four arms but only one head. Decorated lavishly with orna ments, his chest is to display the srivatsa symbol. On his left should be shown Gadadev? and on his right Cakra-deva, while between his feet should be portrayed the earth-goddess, Vasudh?r?. It is apparent that the representation differs from the text only in minor details. The position of the two personified attributes is reversed in the image. The Vishnudharma, it may be asserted, is probably one of the earliest of the Vaishnava pur?nas and is believed to have been written no later than the fifth century. It is significant that the Vishnudharma does describe the personified attributes of Vishnu, a feature common enough in Gupta art of the fourth-fifth century (Fig. 4), but not found much earlier. A similar though more elaborate description is given in Chapter 85 of the Vishnudharmottara pur?na.17 Significantly, in this form Vishnu is known as V?sudeva. The elaborations occur in the more detailed description of the earth-goddess 3J</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 4. Vishnu Trim?rti, Mat hura, 3th century, pink sandstone, Mat hura Muse uni. (Photograph, The American Academy of Benares.) Fig. 5. Catur?nana Vishnu, Kashmir, 8th century, Bronze. From the Nasli and Alice Heeramaneck Collection, Los Angeles County Museum of Art. and the attributes of V?sudeva. The goddess, re ferred to as Mah?, is to be portrayed not only as a beautiful woman, but she should look up at her master in great amazement (antarddris? mah? k?ry? devadarsanavismita). With regard to the attributes, we are told that the conch and the lotus should be represented in their original forms, but the mace and the wheel should be per sonified. Gad?n?ri should be depicted as a beau tiful woman with a thin waist and as a mughdh? or an infatuated adolescent girl. Moreover, she is to hold a flywhisk in her hand while the god's hand is to rest on her head. More interesting is the physical description of Cakrapurusha. He is to be portrayed as an obese figure with round and staring eyes and should carry a flywhisk while looking intently at his master. More commonly, however, Vishnu is portrayed in Kashmir with four heads rather than one. Apart from the normal human head, he is given the heads of a boar and a lion on either side, while that at the back has a frightful expression. This type of image is commonly identified as "Vaikuntha Caturmurti" based, however, on in sufficient evidence. Only in such late icono graphie texts as the Devat?m?rtiprakarana, the K?pamdana or the Apar?jitaprcch? do we find the use of the name Vaikuntha.18 Although Vai kuntha is said to have four heads, it may be pointed out that the fierce head in such descrip tions is replaced by that of a woman. Further more, he is invariably said to possess eight arms rather than four and he always rides his mount Garuda. The description, therefore, substanti ally differs from the typical standing Kashmiri Vishnu, as seen for example in the Los Angeles bronze (Fig. 5). The earliest description of the so-called Vai kuntha form occurs in Chapter 44 of the Vish nudharmottarapur?na. But here also the god is said to ride the Garuda and is provided with four heads and eight arms. Further, the image is not referred to as Vaikuntha Caturmurti, but as Vishnu in the r?jasika aspect of the Vaishnavi Trinity. A slightly simpler form of the deity, this time with only four arms, is described in the Jay?khyasamhit?, probably an earlier text than the Vishnudharmottara, and here too the deity is said to ride upon the Garuda.19 Of all the early texts, only in the Jay?khyasamhit? the appella tion Vaikuntha occurs, although it is used to describe specifically the human face. The image type is designated as Vishnu. 36</page><page sequence="5">There seems no literary evidence, therefore, to identify the standing images of Vishnu from Kashmir as Vaikuntha. The closest that an image comes to the standard descriptions of Vaikuntha may be seen in an eleventh century sculpture in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Figs. 6-7). Here the deity is shown riding his mount, the Garuda, although the number of arms re mains four. In addition, he is accompanied by his consort, Sr?-Lakshm?, who is not included in the textual descriptions. However, Vaikuntha is also the name of Vishnu's paradise where the god is said to dwell in perpetual bliss with his wife. It would be appropriate, thus, to refer to those Vishnu images where the deity has one head as V?sudeva, following the Vishnudharmottara pur?na. The multiple headed images may more appositely be called Catur?nana Vishnu rather than the misnomer Vaikuntha. Indeed, if such an image was known in Kashmir as "Vaikuntha", then certainly the name would have been used in the Nllamatapur?na?a specifically Kashmiri text?or by Kalhana, who frequently alludes to Vishnu of the four forms, but never uses the term Vaikuntha. The gradual discovery of Kashmiri art in the last few decades has made it abundantly clear that the most typical Vishnu image from the area represents the god with four heads. The Los Angeles Catur?nana Vishnu (Fig. 5) maybe taken as a representative example. Even in the tenth century, as far off as Khajuraho, the image type became associated with Kashmir. As I have al ready mentioned, the earliest description of the four-headed deity occurs in the Jay?khyasamhit?, a text supposedly redacted in Kashmir in the fifth century. It is also the principal type of Vishnu image described in the Ntlamatapur?na,20 which was probably written around the eighth century, although there are noteworthy differ ences between the two texts. The Ntlamata pur?na does speak of the four arms and four heads as well as the personified attributes, but it ignores the earth goddess. Moreover, the god is said to be recumbent upon the serpent Sesha rather than standing or sitting on Garuda. No Catur?nana Vishnu image has been dis covered yet from Kashmir that may be convinc ingly dated earlier than the eighth century. The majority of the sculptures appears to belong to the Karkota period, when the image may have become especially popular. This seems also to be substantiated by Kalhana whose allusions to Vishnu of the four forms pertain to this period. Fig. 6. Vishnu Vaikuntham?rti, Kashmir, llth century, gray chlorite. From the Alice Heera maneck Collection, Los Angeles County Mu seum of Art. Fig. 1. Fig. 6, rear view. 37</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 8. Vishnu Trim?rti, Northwest India, 6th century, Bronze. Museum f?r Indische Kunst, Berlin. The earliest image of Vishnu with multiple heads, belonging to the north-west, is the well known bronze in Berlin (Fig. 8). Although generally regarded as Kashmiri, it may be the handiwork of a Gandh?ran artist.21 The stylistic parallels with Gandh?ran art are too emphatic, and very likely it is a bronze of the sixth century rather than the seventh, as suggested in the Berlin catalogue.22 At any rate, what is significant for us is that the deity here is given three heads in stead of four. Apart from his principal human head the two side heads are those of a lion and a boar. There seems little doubt that the iconic type is derived directly from earlier images from Mathura (Fig. 4), where the deity appears to have been quite popular during the Gupta period. A palpable difference between the Berlin bronze and its Mathura prototype is that the position of the animal heads in the former is re versed. Indeed, in most such images from Ma thura the lion's head is on the left and the boar's on the right of the human head.23 In all Kashmiri images the reverse is true?a fact that is in ac cordance with the description in the Vishnu dharmottarapur?na. A more significant differ ence is the absence of the earth-goddess in the Mathura sculptures, while in Kashmiri images she is always present. This inclusion of the earth goddess may, therefore, be regarded as an icono graphie trait peculiar to northwest India. Very likely, it is a feature derived from Central Asian iconography where often the earth-goddess is found represented between the feet of Vaisra vana.24 It is also quite clear from the Mathura images and the Berlin Vishnu that the addition of the fourth face at the back seems to be characteristic of Kashmir and was probably developed around the seventh-eighth century. It certainly became prevalent during the Lalit?ditya period and must be taken as a local development, perhaps inspired by the four-headed images of Siva. A plausible attempt has been made to identify this fourth head as Kapila.25 The Jay?khyasamhit? specifi cally designates this head as Kapil?nana, a term that was also known to the author of the Vish nudharmottarapur?na. Already in the Mah?b h?rata, Kapila was considered to be an incarna tion of Vishnu, and other Vaishnava texts, such as the Vishnudharmapur?na, includes him as an avatara.2G There seems little doubt that this Kapila must indeed be the legendary founder of the S?mkhya system of philosophy,27 and very likely the zealous Vaishnavas usurped him as an incarnation of Vishnu, as they did the Buddha. At any rate, although the image of Catur?nana Vishnu was based on a Mathura prototype, the presence of the earth-goddess and the addition of the fourth head may be considered as specific iconographie contributions of Kashmir. The three-headed images of Mathura may originally have been conceived simply to reflect a syncretic attitude. The cults of the boar and the lion remind us strongly of their original totemistic character, and they may have been subsequently incorporated into epic-pur?nic Vishnuism. In fact, it seems quite clear that a number of Vishnu's animal avat?ras, such as fish, tortoise, goose and lion, disguise the earlier to temistic function of such emblems. The tortoise (kacchapa or kasyapa) may well have been the totem of a tribe known as the K?syapas. The legend of the boar in the Rigveda too seems to hint at the animal's totemistic past. Vishnu is said to have carried off buffaloes that belonged to the boar who was later destroyed by Vritra.28 Obviously, this disguises some sort of a conflict between the Aryan Vishnu and a non-Aryan tribe that venerated the boar. The man-lion avat?ra of Vishnu is fully elaborated upon only 38</page><page sequence="7">in the Harivamsa, and originally, the motif may have been represented simply as an animal.29 It is obvious, therefore, that only in the epic-pur?nic period were such syncretic concepts crystallized, and the three-headed Mathura Vishnu images of the Gupta age are the visual reflections of such attempts. Later, the fourth head may have been added either due to Saiva influence or because of the importance of Kapila in the Kashmiri and Himalayan religion. At any rate, the P?ncar?trins may have then quickly adopted the image to suit their own caturvy?ha concept, as is evident from the Vishnudharmottarapur?na.30 IV It has already been pointed out that the most popular emblem of Siva in Kashmir was the linga, as represented in the triad. But there are a num ber of Saiva image types from Kashmir in which the deity is shown in an anthropomorphic form. And, here again, certain forms appear to reflect local peculiarities that may have had an extra Indian origin. In one of the commonest types of Siva images, the deity is shown standing in front of his bull and is accompanied by his consort P?rvati (Fig. 9). In some of these Siva possesses three heads; that in front is a normal human head; that on his right is ferocious; and the head on his left of a female. In others he is given a fourth head at the back. There seems no doubt that originally this form of Siva was derived from Kush?na iconography. Frequently in Kush?na coins, Siva is shown with one or three heads standing against the bull. More unusual, both from the stylistic and iconographie viewpoints, is a sculpture in the Srinagar Museum (Figs. 10-11). The most in teresting feature of this sculpture is that it shows two addorsed figures, and it was obviously meant to be worshipped in the round. On the obverse, Siva and P?rvati stand side by side. Siva has three heads, each of which is marked with a third eye. The central face has a benign expression, and a snake is used to tie the hair into two top-knots. The head above P?rvati is that of a female, but more curious is the angry face on the correspond ing side. Its awesome expression is achieved by the scraggy beard, slightly bulging eyes and a mustache. Although damaged, the arms can be recognized as six in number. Of the three left hands one holds a waterpot, a second is placed on his wife's back, and the third supports a disc. The only remaining right hand carries a rosary, and Fig. 9. Siva-P?rvati, Kashmir, 10th century, gray chlorite. Private Collection, New York. as I will suggest later, the other two hands may have held a second disc and the trident. More intriguing, however, is the figure at the back. That he represents a form of Siva is evi dent from the prominent third eye. Rather un usually he appears to be seated like a yogi which, of course, is quite appropriate for Siva. Far more curious is the delineation of the beard and the flying hair, reminiscent of images of Agni. The left arm is broken, but the right hand grasps a trident which is also a prominent attribute of Siva. Although discovered from the Baramula dis trict, the sculpture has little in common with typically Kashmiri style figures of the Karkota period (Fig. 12). Rather, some of its features, especially the figure of P?rvati as well as the female head of Siva, distinctly reflect strong Gandh?ran influence, even if in a somewhat archaic version. Technically, the sculpture is certainly far more crude and primitive than the more refined and accomplished works of the Karkota period. The proportions of the somewhat sturdy but stocky figure of Siva are reminiscent of a Gandh?ran Bodhisattva or the Vishnu dis covered from Hankrail in Bengal.31 But the most striking feature of the sculpture is the peculiar 39</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 10. Siva-P?rvati, Kashmir, 7th century (?), stone. Sri Pratap Singh Museum, Srinagar. (Photograph, The American Academy of Benares.) Fig. 11. F/V. 20, r^r view. Fig. 12.

Bikaner Museum. 40</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 14. Siva, Balawaste, 7th century. National Museum, New Delhi. treatment of the beard and hair on both Siva's side and rear faces. The figure at the back may well have been inspired by archaic, bearded fig ures of Zeus. Addorsed figures of Siva are somewhat rare but not altogether unusual. From Kashmir itself we have a bronze showing two different forms of Siva in a similar fashion, which I have pub lished elsewhere.32 The Mathura Museum has in its collection a similar Siva-P?rvati image where the deities are represented on both sides. But more commonly such addorsed figures occur in Gand h?ra,33 which is a further link that associates the Baramula sculpture with that region. Finally, an iconographie peculiarity of this curious sculpture is the disc held by Siva with one of his left hands. Another Siva-P?rvati image, published some years ago by Barrett34 and recovered from the northwest, also shows Siva holding a similar disc with one of his left hands. The corresponding right hand supports an object which Barrett has identified as a skull-cup. It may be surmised, therefore, that the upper right hand of Siva in the Baramula sculpture also held a similar emblem. This suggestion may be cor roborated by another interesting Siva-P?rvati sculpture from Rangmahal, now in the Bikaner Museum (Fig. 13) or by two painted repre sentations from Central Asia (Figs. 14-15). Fig. 15. Siva, Dandan-Ulik, 7th century, wood panel. The British Museum, London. The two Central Asian figures have been var iously identified by scholars, but unquestionably both represent Siva.3? In the example from Bala waste (Fig. 14), now in the National Museum, New Delhi, the erect phallus and the third eye are quite prominent. In addition the deity sports a skull crown on his principal head. What is significant for us is the spoked disc held by the upper left hand and crescent supported by the upper right hand. Almost an identical figure adorns a wooden panel from Dandan-Ulik (Fig. 15). Here again the erect phallus and the third eye are easily recognized. Indeed in both illustra tions the manner of showing the male organ through the garment is very like that seen in Kashmiri icons (Fig. 12). Another important parallel with Kashmiri images is provided by the side faces, one of which is terrifying while the other is of a female. The object held near the chest in both paintings is probably the m?tu luhga, while the lower left hand holds a vajra or thunderbolt. Appropriately, in the Dandan-Ulik panel, Siva wears a tigerskin and sits cross-legged on a cushion of checkerboard pattern. In front of him are two bulls instead of one. More im portantly, the two upper arms support two discs, which are marked with symbols that also appear in the solar and lunar discs held frequently by Bodhisattvas in Central Asian paintings. 41</page><page sequence="10">There seems little doubt, therefore, that the discs in the Central Asian paintings represent the sun and the moon. In the Balawaste painting the crescent in the right hand is quite unmistakable. In view of this the emblems held by the addi tional hands in the Rangmahal terracotta may also be identified as the solar and the lunar sym bols. Barrett obviously mistook the crescent as a skull-cap both in this instance as well as in his description of the S?hi Siva-P?rvati. Finally, the circular object in one of the left hands of the Baramula Siva (Fig. 10) must also represent the solar symbol, and the corresponding right hand must have held the lunar emblem. It is well-known that the sun and the moon played important roles in Central Asian iconog raphy. Although the Rangmahal sculpture is earlier than either Central Asian representations, very likely Siva acquired these two attributes in that region. The S?hi relief published by Barrett, as well as the Baramula sculpture, definitely in dicates that this iconographie peculiarity was also known in northwest India. The textual au thority for this is found in the N?lamatapurana. We are told that a demon called Jalodbhava once attacked the gods and plunged the world in darkness. In order that Vishnu could find and destroy him, Siva upheld the sun and the moon with his two hands. I am not aware if this legend occurs in other Saiva pur?nas and certainly is not included in the Sivapur?na, unless Jalodbhava is the same as Jalandhara. Its inclusion in the Nilamatapur?na seems significant, and one won ders if the story of Siva upholding the sun and the moon was not invented to explain an icono graphie feature that was both extraneous and peculiar. In view of the Jalodbhava legend it may be pertinent to discuss further the rather unusual Rangmahal relief (Fig. 13). A comparison with the Dandan-Ulik painting makes it clear that there is some relationship between the two repre sentations of Siva. In both Siva sits in a similar fashion and although the Rangmahal figure has only one bull there is a distinct stylistic resem blance between the painted animals and the ter racotta version. The Rangmahal Siva, it may be pointed out, has only two arms attached to the body. The additional arms belong to the fourth head on top. It may be of interest to note that the practice of representing additional heads at the top is characteristic of early Indian iconog raphy of the Kush?na period. The manner of delineating the hair of this fourth head is strik ingly similar to the streaky hair and beard of the Baramula Siva. What is curious, however, is the additional figure that seems to be flying through the air above Siva's head. Its exact function is not clear, but could this by any chance be the demon Jalodbhava? Fig. 16. Hari-Hara, Bihar, 7th century, buff sandstone. Patna Museum. (Photograph, The American Acad emy of Benares.) V As in other areas of India where epic-pur?nic Br?hmanism prevailed, Brahma, Vishnu and Siva formed the triad in the Kashmiri pantheon as well. Of the three Brahma remained a relatively insignificant figure, while ?iva and Vishnu be came the most important Br?hmanical divinities. Already by the Kush?na period, and certainly by the age of the Guptas, a synthesis between the two major sects led to the creation of the Hari Hara image. In a typical image of the late Gupta period illustrated here (Fig. 16) the right half of the figure represents Siva and the left half 42</page><page sequence="11">Vishnu. This is the type of image that remained the standard in most parts of India, and the con cept of Hari-Hara seems particularly to have captured the imagination of the Khmers in Cam bodia. But there too the images followed the established formula that was crystallized in Gupta India. Fig. 17. Hari-Hara, Kashmir, 8th century, gray chlorite. Collection Paul F. Walter, New York. There is nothing surprising, therefore, to dis cover an image of Hari-Hara in Kashmir where both Siva and Vishnu became equally popular during the Karkota period. But just as the artists of Kashmir, doubtless along with the theologians, created rather unusual forms of Vishnu or Siva, they were equally inventive with the iconography of Hari-Hara, as may be witnessed from a soli tary image now in the collection of Paul Walter in New York (Fig. 17). At a first glance one may well mistake the Walter figure as a representation of Catur?nana Vishnu which became so popular in Karkota Kashmir. But, in point of fact, it is a figure with only three heads, and while the damaged left head is that of a boar, the right head is bearded and ferocious like that in an almost contem porary icon of Siva (Fig. 12). Apart from the Var?ha face on the left, the following features may further be associated with Vishnu. The sacred thread that comes down from the left shoulder is of the conventional variety. In Siva images the sacred thread is formed by one of the god's favorite snakes. The srtvatsa mark is indi cated only partially on the chest and the earth goddess is represented between the feet. The heavy garland of wild flowers (vanam?l?) is usually distinctive of Vishnu, but as I have al ready noted, Siva seems also to don it in Kashmir. The dagger delineated above the right thigh should really be shown on the left as it is usually provided for Kashmiri Vishnus. A final distin guishing feature of the two halves is the differ ent hair designs, the locks on the left cascading down the shoulder in attractive ringlets. On the other hand, Siva's matted locks on the right are crowned by the crescent moon. Apart from the ferocious face to the right of the placid front face, the Siva half is character ized even more prominently than the Vishnu half. The erect phallus beneath the garment is evident, as is the third eye shown only partially here as compared to the other Siva image (Fig. 12). A snake slides down Siva's shoulder in a characteristic manner, and the animal skin drapes the right thigh. It may also be pointed out that the skull and the severed hand, decorating the ferocious head, further emphasize that the Saiva half represents the god's Bhairava aspect. Unfortunately, only one of the four arms is preserved, and the hand clearly grasps the trident that emerges from the graceful dwarf's head. The dwarf's left hand is raised in the gesture of adoration, a gesture seen more commonly with Buddhist figures, while his right hand holds a flywhisk. He is also given a third eye like his master. Obviously this represents the personifica tion of Siva's attribute, the trident. Once again the Kashmiris did not invent the idea of a Tri sulapurusha but borrowed it from Gupta India. A similar dwarf representation of Trisulapurusha may be seen in a magnificent sculpture of a Saiva pratibara; it once graced a monument raised by King Yasodharman in Mandasar (Fig. 18). Such personifications of Siva's attributes, like those of Vishnu, are also known from Nepal. 43</page><page sequence="12">Only the feet remain of the attendant figure on the corresponding side of the Walter relief. It can easily be surmised, however, that the figure must have represented Cakrapurusha, as we find in more conventional Kashmiri Vishnu images (Figs. 5, 8). To my knowledge this peculiar Hari-Hara image is not only a solitary example discovered so far in Kashmir, but also is unique in the entire repertoire of Indian art. I know of no textual description that corresponds to the image. But that the Hari-Hara concept was familiar in Kashmir is evident from the following verses of Kalhana: In that sanctuary which teaches the noble lesson of the friendship of Siva, the conqueror of the god who churns the mind, and of Visnu whose ensign is the eagle, the gold parasol with its decorated staff and consummate workman ship of the former lord seems as if powdered with the pollen of the lotuses of the Gang? scattered by the hisses of the snakes in his hair, while that of the latter is vivid like the con centrated flash of lightning which abides close to his cloud-black hair. The golden parasol forms the covering lid of the golden cavity of the cosmic egg contain ing the sombre and bright regalia and splendid collection of jewels of the moon-crested Siva and Visnu.37 In conclusion, it may be asserted generally that although the concept of a triad?where Brahma, Vishnu and Siva receive equal emphasis?was basically no different in Kashmir than that found in other regions of India, the individual figures representing each deity reflect certain iconographical peculiarities that may be con sidered to be typical of Kashmir. In some in stances the basic iconographie formula may have been borrowed from the art of Gupta India, in others from Central Asia. Both the geographical situation of Kashmir as well as her polyglot so ciety made the region particularly receptive to ideas brought in by immigrants from the north. Borrowing ideas from such continguous areas as Gandh?ra and the Panjab, Kashmiri artists created characteristic iconic types of their own to suit their peculiar religious needs. Thus, the K?pila head was added to Vishnu images and a distinct multi-headed Siva icon was created, per haps to absorb and synthesize diverse local cults. Certainly the fact that Siva is given the lunar and solar symbols in some of his forms reflects a concession to the Central Asian people, who may have brought their cults of astral deities to Kashmir. This inventive as well as syncretic atti tude of the Kashmiris is also reflected in the images of Brahma and Hari-Hara. Neither of these particular forms is met with elsewhere in Indian art. Fig. 18.

In a letter to the author Dr. Hartel has pointed out that the animal skin displayed by the figure is that of a tiger and not of an antelope. I have no doubt, however, that the skin, despite the stylization, is of an antelope and hence appropriate for Brahma. 12. J. M.

First published by R. C.

On p. 56 appears another fragment that may also be identified as Brahma. 15. H. Goetz, Studies in the History and Art of Kashmir and the Indian Himalaya (Wiesbaden, 1969), pi. XXVI. 16. R. C.

Like Vishnu, Vaisravana or Bishamon (in Japanese) is also a lord of sovereignty, a feature he probably borrows from the Iranian deity of royalty Pharro (see Rosenfield, op. cit., p. 96 and passim). 25. Desai, op. cit., pp. 24-25. 26. Hazra, op. cit., p. 146, n. 102. It is significant that in this text the Buddha is not included as an avat?ra of Vishnu, but Kapila is. Moreover, Kapila is characterized as the first hu man incarnation (j?n?mi K?pilam r?pam prathamam pauru sham mama). 27. As has been admirably suggested by Miss Desai (op. cit., pp. 24 and 30). 28.

Tamara Talbot Rice's [Ancient Arts of Central Asia (New York, Washington, 1965), fig. 197] identification of the Dandan-ulik panel is quite untenable. She has identified the figure as a "divinity whom the Khotanese weavers chose as their patron". 36. Ved Kumari, op. cit., pp. 6-7. 37. Pandit, op. cit., p. 683.
