<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stobi: A City of Ancient Macedonia James Wiseman Boston University Djordje Mano-Zissi University of Belgrade A joint American-Yugoslavstaff has been engaged since 1970 in archaeological research, excavation, and conservation at Stobi, an ancient city located at the juncture of the Vardar and Crna rivers, ca. 150 km. north of Thessaloniki in Yugoslavian Macedonia. The Stobi Project has been an interdisciplinary under- taking concerned with problems both of the natural and the man-made environ- ments of the people who lived at Stobi and in the vicinity from the 3rd century B.C. to the late 6th century A.C. The report that follows includes an outline of the results of the excavations in 1975 and of conservation work in 1975 and 1976. There is also an account of the 1976 study season, with some commentary on the special studies that have recently been completed or are in progress, and a discus- sion of plans for future research at Stobi. 1. Introduction The sixth season of excavation and research by the American-Yugoslav Stobi Project was conducted from May to September, 1975. Preliminary reports on the results of the Elrst Elve seasons of the Project have already appeared.' Those reports, and other publications by several members of the staff, provide some background for the historical and physical settings of Stobi as well as an outline of previous work at the site and references to the relevant publications.2 The principal aims of the Project have been briefly set out recently in the preliminary report for 1973-1974.3 This introduction, therefore, need provide only a brief reminder of the importance of Stobi and the reasons for continued research at the site. Human occupation at the site, which juts into the NW angle of the confluence of the Vardar and Crna rivers (FIGS. 1, 2), can be traced from the 3rd century B.C., when it was a relatively small but strategic Paeonian and later 1. The preliminary reports are by James Wiseman and Djordje NIano-Zissi, "Excavations at Stobi, 1970," AJA 75 (1971) 395-411; "Excavations at Stobi, 1971," AJA 76 (1972) 407-424; "Ex- cavations at Stobi, 1972," AJA 77 (1973) 391-403; "Excavations at Stobi, 1973-1974," JFA 1 (1974) 117-148. These reports will be referred to hereafter as W-MZ (1971), (1972), (1973), and (1974) respectively. Other brief reports have appeared and are referred to in W-MZ (1974) 120, note 4, to which should now be added Mano-Zissi, "Stobi, 1970-1972," Macedoniae Acta Archaeologica 1 ( 1975) 199-21 1 (Macedonian with a German summary). 2. Articles on various aspects of Stobi have appeared in Studies in the Antiquities of Stobi, a series of volumes under the General Editorship of Mano-Zissi and Wiseman. Volume I (Beograd 1973) contains eight articles and Volume II (Beograd 1975) has nine articles; the contributors include both Yugoslav and American staff members. These volumes are referred to hereafter as Studies I and II. See also Wiseman, Stobi, A Cuide to the Excavations (Beograd 1973), hereafter, Wiseman, Cuide. The geologic setting is discussed by Robert L.

Macedonian community, to its expansion during the late Republic and early Roman Empire into a large and prosperous municipium, and, finally, through its period as a provincial capital and episcopal see of the later Empire until its abandonment and destruction late in the 6th century A.C. Prchistoric artifacts have occasionally been discovered at Stobi, but to date no undisturbed prehistoric deposit has been identified. Excavations before 1970, chiefly by Yugoslav and Austrian scholars, had revealed a number of buildings, most of which date to the later phases of the city. The Stobi Project (1970-1975) has been concerned with a number of questions regarding the living conditions of the people at Stobi, including the natural environment, and their social organization, arts, crafts, religions, and external relations. The Project is jointly sponsored by Boston University and the National Museum of Titov Veles and was funded in 1975, as in previous years, by grants from the U.S. Foreign Currency Program of the Smithsonian Institu- tion and from Yugoslavia, administered through the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board for Scientific and Technical Cooperation. Additional funds and equip- ment were made available to the Project by a number of institutions and in-</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 3, 1976 271 dividuals.4 Excavation in 1975 was limited to Elve areas: the Theater, the West Cemetery, the House of the Fuller, the Episcopal Basilica and related buildings, and the Central Basilica area.5 The Project's program of excavation in the first three of those areas has now been completed and study for final publication has begun. The last two areas mentioned will require additional investigation. Conservation work and a variety of special studies were being carried out in 1975 concurrently with the excavations. Those activities were continued in the summer of 1976, when there was no excavation, and were made possible by private contributions, by a grant to Boston University from the National En- dowment for the Humanities, and by funds provided by the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. The following narrative provides a preliminary report on the excavations of 1975, a discussion of conservation work and other activities of 4. These include the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, the City of Titov Veles, the Archaeological Museum of Skopje, the National Museum of Stip, the Conservation Institute of Macedonia, the University of Texas at Austin, Boston University, and numerous private donors in the United States. Other institutions provided financial assistance for specific members of the staff and are acknowledged in note 5. It is a pleasure to record here our gratitude to the individuals and the in- stitutions who have made the work at Stobi possible by their generous support. The 1975 season was the final year in which support through the Smithsonian Institution's Foreign Currency Program was possible, so it is fitting here to thank not only that Institution for its support of six years, but also to express our sincere thanks to the entire staff of the Program Office in Washington, D.C., who have been so patient and helpful, especially the Director, Kennedy B. Schmertz, and Betty Wingfield. 5. In 1975 the Co-Directors of the Project were Mano-Zissi and Wiseman; the latter also served as Field Director. Blaga Aleksova, now of the University of Skopje, was Deputy Director at Stobi for Mano-Zissi and the Administrative Director was Tiho Najdovski, Director of the National Museum, Titov Veles. Other members of the staff were as follows. Associate Directors; E. Mott Davis, University of Texas at Austin, and Ivan MikulVcic, University of Skopje. Professor Elizabeth R. Gebhard, the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle, was in charge of work in the Theater where she was assisted by Sarzo Sarzovski, now Director of the Archaeological Museum, Skopje. A grant from the Research Board of the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle to Professor Gebhard made possible additional assistants for the architectural and ceramics documentation in the Theater. Dean L. Moe, Harvard University, supervised work in the Synagogue and Central Basilica, and was assisted by Professor William Poehlmann and his wife, Beverley Pierce. A1 B. Wesolowsky, Christ's College, Cambridge, was in charge of work in the West Cemetery, assisted by Djordje Petacki, National Museum, Titov Veles. Area Supervisors in the Episcopal Basilica were Ruth Kolarik, Harvard University (now teaching at the University of Kansas); Vojislav Sanev, now at the Archaeological Museum, Skopje, and Carolyn S. Snively, University of Texas at Austin. Kolarik also worked briefly in the House of Psalms and Snively in the Central Basilica. Business Manager and inventory: Lucy Wiseman, Boston University.

The Theater A number of minor excavations helped to clarify various architectural details and construction techniques of the different phases of the Theater. The only major area opened (6.5 m. x 6.0 m.) was dug in the hope of conElrming the location of the SE corner of the scene building, part of which appears on a plan published by Balduin Saria.6 The excavation in 1975 achieved this aim but also revealed an unexpected and somewhat puzzling feature of a later phase of the building. The SE corner of the first completed phase of the scene building was located within the trench (FIG. 3). The unexpected discovery was a sturdy wall of stones and concrete, ca. 1.20 m. wide, parallel to the south wall and set 0.95- 1.01 m. to the north of it (inside the earlier limits of the scene building), that extends beyond the east wall of the scene building. That is, the wall clearly served as the back wall of the skene after the earlier wall, and the SE corner, had collapsed. But the later wall existed only in the eastern part of the skene; its western terminus is at the east wall of the Nemeseum.7 It was clear in earlier seasons that this wall dated to a later phase of construction because it spans with an arch the ruins of the east wall of the room to the east of the Nemeseum; but its function was uncertain.8 That uncertainty has been re- moved by the excavations of 1975; the wall was the back wall of the eastern end of the skene proper and was built at a time when the interior was also 6.

Professor Gebhard has been in charge of excavations in the Theater since 1970; she was assisted in 1975 by Sarzo Sarzovski. 7. This western extension of the wall is recorded on the plan published as I 1 1. 3 in W-MZ ( 1972) 419 and is visible in photographs, figs. 9-10, in W-MZ (1974) 129-130. 8. It should be noted that the back wall of the first completed phase of the skene is preserved to approximately the same height as the later wall near its western end. Figure3.

The probable con- struction date of the later wall is late 3rd century A.C.9 The later wall spans the east skene wall of the earlier phase by an arch (FIG. 3), the structural function of which is unclear, though paralleled by the arch in the same wall above another earlier wall to the west, as noted in the preceding paragraph. The builders may have felt that the older walls were not bedded deeply enough, or that they lacked strength for some other reason, so that merely running the new wall across their ruins would weaken the structure. 10 North of the arch a new wall was also constructed atop the ruins of the older east wall and it returns to the east, extending into the unexcavated area (FIG. 4). This eastern extension of the skene probably continued as far as the limit of the parodos, as on the west side;ll both the east and west wings probably belong to the final reconstruction of the theater. The wall with 9. Professor Gebhard comments as follows: "In construction and material it is comparable to the barrier wall protecting the facade at the time of the final reconstruction when the orchestra was permanently enclosed, and to other walls connected with additions to the theater at the end of the 3rd century. This includes the west wing where pottery beneath the floor provides a date in the late 3rd or early 4th century. This date is confirmed by ceramics found in the floor of the passage between the barrier wall and the facade and in the east parodos." 10. Both walls are bedded relatively deeply; unfortunately, the bottom of neither wall has yet been exposed. 11. W-MZ(1974)131.</page><page sequence="8">276 Stobi.

Work continued in the central radial corridor, the orchestra end of which was excavated in 1974.l2 The vaulted roof of the lower part of the corridor, 2.25-2.65 m. above the packed clay floor, ends 3.02 m. from the lower en- trance (i.e., at the central refuge) and a second vault, at a higher level, con- tinues the line of the corridor. The higher vault is carried by relieving arches in the radial walls, 2.72 m. apart, on the east and west sides of the corridor. An uninscribed theater seat, found in the fill, had fallen into the corridor through a hole in the vault near the NE corner (FIG. 5). The ancient collapse made excavation as far as the annular corridor below the diazoma too dangerous to undertake before extensive conservation, though a small test did make it possible to determine that the juncture occurs where predicted. 12.

Excavations in the NW corner of the Nemeseum and near the entrance to the east parodos, which were undertaken to determine, among other things, the size of the podium of the scaenae frons, resulted in two unexpected discoveries. The former brought to light fragments of two marble statues, rare finds at Stobi in recent years, and the latter involved the investigation of a possible prehistoric deposit. The fragments of statuary were found 25-30 cm. below the level of the threshold of the entrance to the room, i.e., at approximately the level at which the silver and gold coin hoard was found in 1974 at the opposite end of the room.'3 Eleven bronze coins, 200 pottery sherds, and the pierced handle of a terracotta moldmade lamp were found in the deposit of the statuary.'4 The date indicated by the context is the end of the 4th century A.C. 1.

Earth within the depression, from elevation 136.705 m. to 136.257 m., was collected directly into plastic bags and subjected to water separation processes. l S Carbonized wood and seeds from the sample were taken to Austin, Texas, where Professor E. Mott Davis reports a radiocarbon date of 1130 + 110 s.c.'6 That date corresponds generally to the date of several sherds, which were identified by V. Sanev as Late Bronze Age. The deposit (Lot 1684), however, was evidently disturbed during the construction of the podium since fragments of lime mortar were also recovered during water- separation, and a few sherds of Early Roman date. 3.

Scale 1:2.  tinued study of the unguentaria in 1975 now suggests that the burials con- taining both fusiform and bulbous or piriform unguentaria date to the mid 1st century B.C. and a few other graves, with typologically "earlier" fusiform unguentaria only, may date to the 2nd century s.c.22 Grave 281, excavated on 24 June, 1974, would belong to the latter group. Grave 281 was a shallow-pit, cremation burial with a stone peribolos, only part of which was preserved, in Trench X4 (Grid areas S76/W136). In the loose, ashy soil of the pit were found fragments of three fusiform unguentaria and a bronze fibula. The fibula, Inv. No. MF-74-123, is a simple, undecorated bow; the pin itself is missing. Two of the unguentaria, Inv. Nos. C-74-354 and 22. Virginia Anderson, staff ceramics analyst, and Wesolowsky have prepared a typology for Stobi unguentaria and a special study is now in preparation for publication. During a visit with us at Stobi in 1975, Professor Homer A. Thompson, of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and former Director of the Athenian Agora excavations, was most helpful in many ways with his sage advice and perceptive comments. We are especially grateful for his obser- vations on our collection of unguentaria. The description of the unguentarium in this article and its dating are based on notes by Anderson.</page><page sequence="13">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 3, 1976 281 355, the largest yet found at Stobi, were mended in 1975 and are almost com- plete; the third, Inv.

The neck flares outward to meet down-flaring, undercut rim. Professor Homer A. Thompson informs us that evidence in the Athenian Agora "suggests that the late 2nd/early 1st century B.C. is the most likely period for the occurrence of oversize specimens." Specific comparanda will be discussed in the study referred to in note 22. There is additional evidence for dating some of the graves of Phase I of the West Cemetery to the 2nd century B.C. We have already noted that baby feeders from Graves 278 and 308 may be that early (note 18 above); and it should be noted that final study of the pottery is still in progress, so that some refinement of the ceramics chronology may be expected. We may also mention that E. Mott Davis reports a C-14 date on a carbon sample from Phase I Grave 295 of 140 i 90 B.C. This single sample, with a possible variation of 180 years, can only be suggestive at the present time; but a program involving some 30 samples is now being prepared by Davis and Wesolowsky.23 The two burials found below the House of the Fuller (FIG. 2, NO. 15)24 may be dated to the 2nd century B.C. with greater confidence. The grave-form of both is similar to that of the Hellenistic graves excavated below the courtyard of the House of Peristerias (FIG. 2, NO. 10).25 Grave 312 is located below the eastern end of Room 28.26 It had been cut into and a large part of it had been destroyed during the construction of the later room walls, but it is clear that the grave was originally rectangular, oriented NE-SW, and had been cut into the pebbly deposit that had been a prehistoric bed of the Crna River. The sides, bottom, and top of the grave pit had been formed of stone slabs. The grave contained the skeleton of a child whose hands had been placed on the breast. Also in the region of the breast were found the scattered remains of a 23. Special Studies Sample No. 77x74. The sample, Lab No. Tx-2317, was dated in 1975-76 at the University of Texas Radiocarbon Laboratory; the other comments above in note 16 regarding Lab No. Tx-2318 are also applicable here. Grave 295 was an adult cremation excavated in 1974 that contained all or part of 9 fusiform unguentaria and 6 necks of unguentaria that might also be fusiform. Illegible bronze coin 75-489 (large pre-Augustan) was also found in the grave. The ash from the grave was processed by water separation in 1975 and coin 75-326 was recovered: it is a debased silver issue of Apollonia and dates to the 2nd or 1st century B.C. (identification by M. H. Crawford from a photograph examined in 1976). 24. Excavation of the two graves, as well as the House of the Fuller itself, was supervised by Ivan Mikulcic. 25.

Grave 313, located below the SE corner of Room 29, had not been disturbed by building activities in the Roman period. A deep deposit of dark earth, streaked with carbonized wood and ashes, lay above the grave pit itself. The number of animal bones within the deposit prompted Professor Mikulcic to suggest that the traces of burning and the bones are the remains Qf the graveside meal of the mourners. The deposit dates to the 2nd century B.c.28 The grave pit proper (1.95 m. x 0.65 m.) was cut into the sterile clay that overlies bedrock in this region of Stobi from elevation 145.774 m. to a depth of about 14 cm. The grave was oriented SE-NW. The remains of an adult male, head to the NW, lay on the floor of the grave. A terracotta lamp of the 2nd century B.C. was found near the waist of the skeleton and eight small iron nails, with traces of wood still attached, were scattered about the grave.29 Mikulcic concludes from the latter circumstance that the corpse had been in- terred in a wooden coff1n. 6.

The lamp falls stylistically between Howland's Type 29A (late 4th to mid-3rd century B.C.) and Type 39 (late 2nd to 1st century B.C.): Richard Hubbard Howland, The Athenian Agora IV: Greek Lamps and Their Survivals (Princeton 1958). A date of early to mid-2nd century B.C. is likely. The discovery of these two graves almost midway between the previously discovered Hellenistic cemetery below the House of Peristerias and the West Cemetery (see FIG. 2) is of considerable interest. If the earliest burials in the West Cemetery are, after all, as early as the 2nd century B.C., the Hellenistic cemetery was much more extensive than previously thought. That cir- cumstance could affect our estimate of the size and form of the Hellenistic settlement; that is, it might have extended well upstream along the left bank of the Crna, rather than have been confined to the small land-area more closely defined by the Vardar-Crna confluence. 4.

There remained for 1975, consequently, the excavation of the earlier levels, i.e., the monumental construction phases of the House of the Fuller. A marble Ionic column base, discovered in 1974 where it protruded above the 5th century floor of Room 28, appears to be at the NW corner of the peristyle of the large 4th century structure. A second base was found in situ on the stylobate to the east where it had been incorporated into the SE wall of Room 28 and, later in the 5th century, had been built over by yet another wall (FIG. 14). The interaxial distance is 3.3 m. The stylobate itself was largely destroyed, but its line is indicated clearly in the sterile pebble deposit in which it had been laid. A mortar bedding south of the stylobate preserved the im- pressions of the stone slabs that once had covered the courtyard and some pieces of the flagging were found still in place (e.g., as seen to the right in FIG. 14). The mortar paving, like the stylobate, was laid on the prehistoric pebble deposit. The courtyard of the large 4th century residence, then, was originally paved over its entire area, 10.05 m. N-S and 9.20 m. E-W. Any earlier structures, at least in the NW area, would have been destroyed during construction: even Grave 312 of the 2nd century B.C. was badly disturbed when the northern complex of rooms was built. Other remains from earlier structures included part of a stone and mortar wall north of the peristyle and four pits, all probably originally for large amphoras (parts of two were found in the pbts), which had been dug into the sterile deposit: most of the related material dated to the 3rd century A.C. No architectural elements earlier than the main large structure were found below Room 27 and in Room 32, in the NW corner, there was no deposit earlier than the late 4th-early 5th centuries A.C. 5. The Episcopal Basilica Excavation in the Episcopal Basilica in 1975 was conducted chiefly in three areas: 1) the south aisle, where we hoped to determine somewhat more about the form and function of the earlier buildings that had been partially ex- 30.

In addition, a trench begun in 1974 near the eastern end of the north aisle was continued, in a smaller test, to sterile soil which was encountered at elevation 140.496 m. Surprisingly, no architectural features were encountered in the trench, which began at approximately the level of the basilica floor (here, elevation 147.565-147.163 m.) and the lowest deposit containing cultural material was dated to the 2nd-3rd centuries A.C.31 Two trenches were dug successively in the south aisle; both were supervised by Carolyn S. Snively. The Elrst, at the east end of the aisle, had been started 31. Context Storage Lot 1699.

A City of Ancient Macedonia/ Wiseman and Mano-Zissi in 1974 and parts of two walls were exposed at that time.32 The walls belong to what we may now designate Building B: its orientation and wall construction are both somewhat different from Building A, whose frescoed south wall was first found somewhat further west in 1973. The difference in orientation may be seen in Figure 15. The socles of Building B, which are built of smaller stones, are rather less sturdy than the wall of Building A and the latter has terre pise atop the socle, whereas Building B makes use of mud bricks. The bright yellow bricks are preserved in five courses on the E-W wall (FIG. 16), Wall 3, separated by a dark earth mortar 3-4 cm. thick. The bricks vary in two dimensions (H. 0.055-0.080 m. W. along wall 0.34-0.36 m.), but all were either as wide as the socle (0.63-0.68 m.) or were laid without mortar across the wall thickness. The N-S wall, Wall 2, continues north beyond the bonded juncture with Wall 3 and was cut off by the south stylobate of the Basilica. The hard-packed earthen floor in Room 1 (south of Wall 3) lies at elevation 143.38 m. which Figure 16. Mud bricks of Building B below south aisle of Episcopal Basilica.

Pottery below both surfaces indicates a construction date in the 4th century A.C., possibly early in that century.33 Building B seems to have continued in use until the construction of the basilica early in the 5th century. The trench further west, in which the frescoed wall of Building A had been found, was enlarged to the east. The wall has now been revealed on its north side for a length of 8.40 m. and the interior floor space extends 4.10 m. north, where the pink mortar floor is interrupted by the south stylobate of the basilica. The floor lies nearly 4 m. below the level of the basilica.34 Within this area there was no interior support, cross-wall, or wall parallel to the south wall. The later Fresco II was poorly preserved all along the new stretch of wall (FIG. 17). At the end of the season it was removed for preservation by Dj. Georgievski;35 the earlier Fresco I was preserved behind it only for a short dis- tance further east than had been found in 1973 (FIG. 18).36 A large quantity of ceiling fresco was found in debris that included roof tiles near the level of the floor. The fresco fragments are colorful with a variety of patterns in red, green, blue, white, black, and gray (FIGS. 19-20). All the ceiling fresco (fresco secco) fragments had reed impressions on the back.37 The ceiling debris had fallen onto a greenish-grey clay deposit at elevation 143.41 m. This deposit extended in places to the pink mortar floor (elevation 143.24 m.), but over most of the area was separated from it by thin layers of black clay and of a hard earth of mixed colors. The clay deposit contained a 33. Context Storage Lots 1843 (beneath the floor of Room 1) and 1832-1836 (below exterior use- level). 34. W-MZ (1974) 141-142, fig. 28. 35.

At the time of excavation we considered these three lowest layers possibly to have been deposited by water. The excavator, Carolyn Snively, now suggests that the clay might have been the bedding for a stone or opus sectile paving, as known in other buildings at Stobi. More puzzling is the early date. The deposit representing the ceiling and roof collapse (Lot 1809) also contains mostly 1st century A.C. pottery, but is mixed with some pottery of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th centuries. The higher deposits contain chiefly pottery and some coins of the late 4th and early 5th centuries. Unfortunately no coins were found in the lowest deposits in 1975, though in 1973 Zika Radosevic reported a 4th century coin found some 20 cm. above the floor in the first trench dug that revealed the floor of Building A. 39 The early date seems especially anomalous because adjacent (or contiguous) Building B, with a floor at ap- proximately the same level, dates to the early 4th century. Additional excava- tion is required to clarify the nature of these deposits, the chronology of the building, and even, still, the form and function of this brightly decorated structure. Excavation in the area south of the basilica in 1975 was supervised by Ruth Kolarik. The area of interest was the western part of an apsidal structure that had been partly excavated in 1971 and 1972.4° Later study of floor mosaic fragments found in those excavations enabled Kolarik and Momcilo Petrovski to propose a restoration of the upper floor, where the mosaic pavement had been laid, along with a possible restoration of the mosaic design.4' Other finds suggest that the walls were frescoed, perhaps with figured designs.

The room concerned is part of a complex of walls that in their original form pre-dated the Episcopal Basilica; it is located south of the narthex, but is oriented quite differently from the basilica. Part of the NE wall of the apsidal room served as the south supporting wall for the sandstone stairway that the builders of the basilica set in place to provide communication between the narthex and, through the eastern basement of the apsidal building, the Bap- tistery (FIG. 21). The excavations were intended to extend the area previously dug far enough to the west to reveal the entire building, determine the location of the en- trance(s), the level of the mosaic floor, and test the hypotheses presented in Studies II. The room proved to be rather larger than expected, and may be as much as 15.5 m. long (interior measureme-nt), a size which would allow space for two mosaic fields beyond those shown in the proposed reconstruction by Kolarik-Petrovski.42 In any case, the west wall lies beyond the western limit of the 1975 excavation (FIG. 22). An entrance was found on the south, but there may have been another doorway to the west. A large number of mosaic fragments were recovered and their find spots meticulously recorded to facilitate reconstruction in the future. The contextual material found in the excavations substantiate the late 6th century destruction date proposed for the basilica complex and a number of architectural details were noted that will be of significance in the preparation of the architectural history of the area. A bronze cross, fitted with attachments for glass lamps, was found in the lowest level of destruction debris. The cross adds to the growing mass of eviderlce for the identification of this structure as a part of the ecclesiastical complex. 7. Bronze cross. Inv. No. MF-75-68. FIG. 23. Overall dimensions, H. ca. 0.34 m. W. 10.192 m. Complete except for part of one of the lower attached wires. The cross is made of two thin strips (0.003-0.004 m.) of bronze with flaring ends, fastened by a central rivet. Bronze strips bent to form circular bands are attached to each end of the horizontal arm by two rivets and three wires ter- minating in hooks are attached, by means of a Elgure-8 hook, to a hole in one end of the vertical arm. There is a small hole also in the other end of the same arm. The two circular bands probably held glass lamps for burning oil. The hooks might have served for the suspension of other lamps, or alternatively were for the suspension of the cross and lamps themselves. In the latter case, it would still have been possible to have a lamp or other object suspended by attachment through the hole at the bottom of the lamp. Excavation in the presbyterium of the basilica has added greatly to our un- derstanding of its form and of the floor pavements of its two phases.43 The chancel screen of Phase II, which separates the nave from the presbyterium, returned to the east in line with the back of the two facing synthronoiJ thereby creating narrow (ca. 1.0 m.) aisles between the presbyterium and the north and 42.

Detail of | j south synthronos _Es I contained a large number of mosaic tesserae of the kind found in Mosaic I of the south aisle.44 Excavations were not carried to the west end of the presbyterium on either side, so it is not certain, but is probable, that the chancel screen of Phase I ex- tended to both stylobates. On the north side of the presbyterium only part of the rough stone substructure for the Phase I mortar bedding was discovered. The floors within the presbyterium corresponded in level and material to the two phases just described.45 The mortar bed of Phass II was removed in the vicinity of the synthronos and the stone substructure photographed with a Whittlesey bipod (FIG. 26). The stones were then removed and the well- preserved mortar bed of Phase I was cleaned for study. The imp.ressions of the opus sectile floor are distinct (FIG. 27) and a reconstruction of the pattern is now being drawn, based on a drawing of the impressions by Momcilo Petrovski and Bosko Damjanovski. Many of the marble pieces were obviously re-used: the impression of an un- fluted column shaft is visible immediately west of the synthronos in Figure 27 and, to the north (left) in the same photograph, is the negative impression of a sculptured relief of a horse and rider. Some marble pieces were found in situ along the west side of the south synthronos. The synthronos, as Figure 28 reveals, was smaller in Phase I: the lowest step, which covers part of the Phase I floor, was added in Phase II. Work in the apse itself has clarified a number of architectural details that will be discussed in a later report. 6. Synagogues and the Central Basilica Excavations in the Central Basilica and the structures below it were es- pecially rewarding in 1975.46 The most significent results included the 44.

In a small test near the center of the sanctuary area of the basilica a cross- shaped reliquary crypt was revealed (FIG. 29). The walls of the crypt were made of lime mortar and stones of varying sizes and are framed above by stone 47.

The crypt has four arms of approximately equal length: 0.61 m. N-S and 0.58 m. E-W and, measured from the top of the stone slabs, is over 0.5 m. deep. The east arm has three small, additional recesses, one each in its south, east, and north sides. The crypt had been sealed with stones and bricks set in a pink mortar. This covering had been broken through and the crypt plundered, presumably in antiquity. But the presence of the cross in this religious struc- ture makes it certain that it was, as maintained earlier, a Christian church.

Study and Conservation of Mosaics The study, documentation, and conservation of mosaics at Stobi involved work in several areas and some excavation. The mosaic floor of the room west of the baptistery of the North Basilica</page><page sequence="30">298 Stobi: A City of Ancient Macedonia/ Wiseman and Mano-Zissi was uncovered (for the Elrst time in nearly 40 years), cleaned, and photo- graphed (FIG. 32).51 Most or all of 10 panels are preserved with representations of a basket with fruit, a chalice, and eight birds, including two probable birds in panels barely visible because they are built over by the west wall of the bap- tistery. The latter circumstance and the fact that the mosaic and room walls are oriented differently are among the evidence that the mosaic antedates the room arrangement. There is also some evidence, which will be discussed elsewhere, that another panel with a geometric design represents a different phase of the floor. The nearly square panels with Christian motives are very similar to panels in the western third of the triclinium of the House of Psalms.52 Mosaic work in the synagogue chiefly involved documentation and conser- vation. A minor excavation, however, was carried out in the adjacent House of Psalms in Room 5 (to the right of the main entrance from the Via Axia; see FIG. 2), from which the mosaic floor pavement had been lifted, along with its mortar bedding, before World War II. The mosaic is now stored in the National Museum at Beograd. Room 5 is the only room in the building that had not been affected by the extensive conservation and restoration project carried out by the Conservation Institute of Macedonia in 1965-69. The ex- cavations revealed, among other things, that the mosaic had been laid in the late 4th or early 5th century A.C. Cleaning and stabilization of several decorative floor pavements continued in the House of Peristerias, the Theodosian Palace, and in the south aisle of the Episcopal Basilica. Several water-color reproductions, at a scale of 1:10, were completed, including the monumental task of drawing the remains of Mosaic I in the south aisle of the Episcopal Basilica.s3 In the House of Parthenius (FIG. 2, NO. 13) the mosaic in Room 8 and the opus sectile floor in Room 9 were uncovered; cleaning, documentation, and conservation were begun. Both had been excavated before World War II, but only sketchily published and not conserved (the original documentation does not exist).54 We have commented above (Section 5) on the work with mosaic fragments from the area south of the narthex. 8. Special Studies In addition to the various special studies referred to in the preceding sec- tions of this article, several other projects should be mentioned, some of which involved Eleld work in 1975. The study of the faunal material from stratiEled deposits at Stobi, which constitutes a collection unique in its size and extent from an historical site in the Old World, was begun in 1975 by Anne Ogilvy. The faunal material from the Hellenistic and Early Roman levels below the courtyard of the House of 51. Ruth Kolarik and Momcilo Petrovski supervised all work on mosaics. This mosaic was dis- cussed briefly in J. Petrovic, "Krstionice u Stobima," Umetnicki Pregled 3 (1940) no. 9, pp. 263, 266-267. 52. See the excellent photograph of the triclinum mosaic taken from a balloon: Julian H. Whittlesey, "Whittlesey Foundation Field Activities, 1974," JFA 1 (1974) 321, fig. 4. 53. It seems appropriate here to acknowledge the highly talented group of artists who worked un-. der the direction of Petrovski: Veljo Tasovski (who was chiefly responsible for drawing the latter mosaic mentioned above), Baze Kuzmanovski, and Bosko Damjanovski. 54.

A City of Ancient Macedonia/ Wiseman and Mano-Zissi Peristeriasss was selected for a pilot project and examined with a view towards establishing a basis for a study of numerous problems, including dietary and environmental changes at Stobi during the more than eight centuries of its oc- cupation. A preliminary report of the results of that investigation has been pre- pared and will shortly appear. A faunal research group has now been formed which includes, in addition to Ogilvy, Sebastian Payne of the American Research Institute in Turkey (1975-1976), who will be especially concerned with the microfauna; and for macrofauna, Brian C. Hesse, pre-doctoral fellow in Anthropology at the Smithsonian Institution (1975-1976), and Paula Wap- nish, a graduate student at Columbia University.56 A detailed program of study has been formulated to be undertaken over the next two years. Samples from five amber beads found in three graves of the West Cemetery were extracted in May, 1975, by Professor Joan M. Todd of the San Jose State University of California. The samples were subsequently analyzed by infrared spectroscopy by Angela Macchiarulo, a student of Professor Curt W. Beck at Vassar College. The details of her report will be incorporated into the forthcoming volume on the West Cemetery. We note here that Macchiarulo reports that four of the five samples "are of succinite, the variety of amber native to northern Europe and often loosely called 'Baltic amber'."57 The significance of the results of such provenience analyses for the study of ancient trade routes and the origin of amber found in Yugoslavia is discussed in detail by Joan M. Todd, Marijean H. Eichel, Curt W. Beck, and Angela Macchiarulo in an article elsewhere in this issue of the Journal of Field Archae- ology. Mortar samples were collected from a number of ancient structures at Stobi by E. Mott Davis in 1975. Professor Robert L. Folk and Salvatore Valastro, Jr., of the University of Texas, plan to subject those samples to the new tech- nique that they have developed for dating mortar by carbon-14.58 Reference has already been made above (see Section 3) to the program of Davis and Wesolowsky for radiocarbon dating of charcoal from graves of the West Cemetery. 9. Stobi in 1976 There were no excavations in 1976 when the efforts of the staff were directed towards the continuing tasks of documentation, conservation, and study of materials and records for the preparation of final publications. The work was made possible by a gifts-and-matching grant to Boston University from the National Endowment for the Humanities, by contributions from a number of private individuals in the United States, and by funds provided by the Socialist Republic of Macedonia and the City of Titov Veles.

The samples are Vassar Serial Nos. 3405, 3407-3410. On No. 3408, a bead from Grave 166, Macchiarulo comments: "The infrared spectrum did not permit identification as Baltic amber, but the general features of the spectrum show that it is a fossil resin, i.e., amber in the larger sense of that term." 58.

Boris Lefkov was dark room techni- cian. American staff members present were as follows: Virginia Anderson ceramics analysis; Elizabeth Gebhard, who is preparing a volume on the Theater, assisted by Paul Gebhard as photographer; Fritz Hemans, chief architect, assisted by Margaret Denney and Fred Guthrie, both students at Cornell University (Guthrie was also staff photographer) and, for a briefer period in June, by Marisa Manly, a student at Cornell University, and Whitney Powell of the Peabody Museum, Harvard University; Dean Moe, study of the synagogues and the Central Basilica, assisted by Anita Moe; Carolyn S. Snively, study of the Casa Romana and of spatial forms of basilicas; Al Wesolowsky, in addition to various administrative duties, study of the West Cemetery; and James Wiseman, preparation of a variety of reports and epigraphical studies. Michael H. Crawford of Christ's College, Cambridge University, completed the Eleld examination of the coins in August. The results of the studies listed above, and of others, will appear in a third (and perhaps a fourth) volume of the series Studies in the Antiquities of Stobi, and in a second series of volumes, Stobi. Some six volumes are planned for the latter series which will provide integrated final reports on the principal areas of excavations at Stobi that were undertaken by the Project. There will also be a volume dealing with the history and testimonia of Stobi. The completion of these studies and the preparation of the manuscripts will involve both Yugoslav and American staff members over the next four to Elve years. Continued excavation in the Episcopal Basilica and the Central Basilica/Synagogue will also be required. This second phase of the Project, in- augurated in 1976, provides the opportunity for continued research by a fully integrated, and interdisciplinary, international staff of scholars. The authors of this report feel honored to be members of that staff and they express here their gratitude to other staff members and to the many other individuals and institutions who have made possible the rewarding cooperative work of the past seven years at Stobi. 59. James Wiseman, Project Co-Director, was at Stobi during June and briefly in August; A1 Wesolowsky was American Deputy Director in July and August. Vojislav Sanev and Blaga Aleksova were the Yugoslav Deputy Directors in June/July and August, respectively.</page><page sequence="34">302 Stobi: A City of Ancient Macedonia/ Wiseman and Mano-Zissi James Wiseman is ProSessor o+Classics and of Fine Arts and is Chairman of the Department o+Classical Studies at Boston University.
