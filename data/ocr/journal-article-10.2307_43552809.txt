<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SEAL IMPRESSIONS FROM CEZBET RUSHDI, AREA R/III OF TELL EL-DABCA: PRELIMINARY REPORT Chiara Reali * The excavation of area R/III1, situated south-east of the modern village of cEzbet Rushdi, began in the fall campaign of 2010, and continued - though at a smaller scale- in spring 2011, when a test trench was made in order to reach the lowest settlement layers. This has shown that the area was used dur- ing the whole 15th dynasty and was first occupied in the beginning of this period. The excavations brought to light quite a large city compound, made up of housing units, presumably arranged along a parallel road network (fig. 1). The uppermost layer can be dated to the late Second Intermediate Period (first half of the 16th century B.C.). Among the archaeological finds, such as pottery, lithics, faience objects and pumice fragments, seal impressions on lumps of clay constitute a signifi- cant group of discoveries, totalling 470 pieces2. Due to the extreme difficulty of sieving muddy soils, systematic recovery of such small finds at Tell el-Dabca was not possible until the development of Fig. 1, Plan of R/III with the indication of the discussed loci * University of Vienna. This manuscript was submitted for publication in 201 1 , since then, further fieldwork and study of the material has been done, allowing reconsidering and revising some of the previ- ous conclusions. For recent interpretations concerning the chronology of the area R/III s.

The investigation of the complex was completed in spring 2012, excavating 13 more squares. During this campaign more than 600 further seal impressions were recovered which will not be taken into consideration in this paper because their documentation is ongoing.</page><page sequence="2">68 Chiara Reali Fig. 2, Inv.

Thereafter, the percentage of seal impressions among the other finds in- creased4, and the group from R/III constitutes the largest group of seal impressions ever found in an excavation area at the site. Seal Impressions5 The seal impressions found at Tell el- Dabca are made using stamp seals, incised on the bases of scarabs. The number of matrices found is small in rela- tion to their impressions. Nineteen scarabs have been recovered, but only 13 were carved and used as stamps6. Apart from sealings and scarabs there are also other kinds of cretulae. The first (Inv. Nr. 9467 X) is a multi-stamped solid ovoid cretula1, originally surrounding a rope; the other two (Inv. Nr. 9445 O and Q) are round and flat lumps of clay with no trace of suspension and both bear the impression of the same seal (figs. 2-3). These objects were also used in the accounting system but, for the persons in charge of it, they probably had a different pur- pose and meaning from the more common seal impressions and they were likely not used to pre- serve the integrity of containers but to register a transaction8. For the entire group of 470 impressions, the majority of them can be ascribed to the buildings of the later Second Intermediate Period and later, and a smaller percentage (9,4%) can be attributed to earlier strata , only reached in the test trench mentioned above. Interesting results emerged from counting un- stamped lumps of clay. The loci with a higher per- centage of unstamped sealings fragments showed only few (2 or 3 pieces) or no seal impressions. This could suggest that after opening the sealed con- tainer and breaking the cretula , the part with the impression was kept, probably as a receipt, and the rest was thrown away and possibly periodically collected and removed. Otherwise, it could suggest that, in certain areas of the complex, occurred more frequent administrative operations than in other sectors and that, in order to advance rapidly, the containers were secured only affixing an unstamped lump of clay. Patterns and designs of R/III seal impressions The majority of the seal impressions from R/III - many only fragmentary - shows typical scrolls and spirals (both unlinked and interlocking)9 patterns. Other motifs include floral designs10, concentric 3 Consisting in letting the soil of each locus (archeological deposit) dry for 3^1 days before sieving it. 4 230 Sealings in F/II and 70 in H/VI: Bietak, 2004; Sartori, 2009; Zeger, 2009. 5 "Seal impression" is a synecdochical term used (among many others, used in more or less specific meaning, such as [lat.] cretula , bulla , [engl.] sealing, clay sealing, [germ.] Siegelabdruck, Tonverschluss, [fr.] empreinte de sceaux/sur bulle, [it.] impronta su bolla, sigillatura) to define an object made of ductile material - usually clay - bearing the impres- sion of a seal.

The Seal Impressions from cEzbet Rushdi, Area R/III of Tell el-Dabca: Preliminaty Report 69 Fig. 4, Inv. Nr. 9464, obverse and reverse Fig. 5, Inv. Nr. 9466, obverse and reverse Fig. 6, Inv. Nr. 9465, obverse and reverse Fig. 7, Inv. Nr. 9446 N, obverse and reverse circles11, coiled and "woven" patterns12, smì-tìwy designs formulae and cartouches14 often in asso- ciation with the so-called anra- motif. Beyond these subjects, seal impressions displaying human, royal and divine figures (both masculine and feminine), and real and imaginary animals15 typical of the late Palestinian series16 are also part of the assemblage. A group of 7 sealings bearing two Hyksos rulers' names and/or their titulary deserves particular at- tention and will be discussed here in detail. Six of them can be referred to the king Khyan and one possibly to one of his successors, Apophis. Inv. Nr. 9464: R/III - q/6-7, Planum 2, Stratum bx' L18 338 (fig. 419) This is the best-preserved seal impression of Khyan in R/III. It shows three fields delimited by two pairs of thin vertical elements20. Two of the three columns are almost entirely preserved, while the upper part of the third one is missing. The two lateral fields both show the formula whm rnh "live again"21, and the central one contains the royal-name hj'in "Khy- an", surmounted by the Hyksos titulary hkì hiswt "Ruler of the foreign countries". The upper part of the hkì sceptre and the "foreign land" hieroglyph are missing. The clay used is red and fine, and the sealing was fired after being removed from the con- tainer. The reverse of the sealing shows the impres- sions of a rope and a wooden peg, while one other side of the sealing reveals the impression of a wood- en surface. In all likelihood, a wooden box or chest, provided with a pair of knobs (one on the cover and one on one side), that were tied up together with a rope to close the container and seal it. Inv. Nr. 9466: R/III - r/7, Planum 3-4 , Stratum c, L 260 (fig. 5) This sealing seems to have been made using the same matrix as Inv. Nr. 9464, although here the</page><page sequence="4">70 Chiara Reali Fig. 8, Inv. Nr. 9452 R, obverse and reverse Fig. 9, Inv. Nr. 9466 N, obverse and reverse Fig. 10, Inv. Nr. 9467, obverse and reverse preserved stamped surface is more damaged than the former piece: the left column is almost entirely preserved, the central one with the titulary is dam- aged at both extremities, and the right column shows the rnh at its bottom and the lower part of whm in the middle. The clay used is brownish and fine, and seems to have been fired after the sealing was broken. The reverse and upper sides show the same kind of impressions as Inv. Nr. 9464 and could be interpreted as above. Inv. Nr. 9465: R/III - r/5, Planum 12, Stratum g, L 473 (fig. 6) The third sealing shows only the lower part of the impression. It consists of a paired scrolls border, interrupted at the bottom by part of the royal ascrip- tion di cnh "given life"22. The border is fully pre- served only at the lower left side of the seal impres- sion; the opposite side preserves only traces of two scrolls. The central field is occupied by a cartouche, whose upper part is lost. What remains is the lower rounded portion of a hieroglyph, followed by two ii and n at the bottom. It is plausible to read the first hieroglyph as a h23 and to assume that the royal name in this cartouche is that of Khyan. The lack of an i24 in the name may be considered a short form or a mistake. A similar example is provided by a scarab in the Egyptian Department of the British Museum25: if we consider the lower part of this seal, the only difference is the lack of n instead of 1. The seal Inv. Nr. 9465 is different from the first two and it is stylistically comparable to the seal of Khyan found on 40 impressions from the recent excavation of an administrative complex at Tell Edfu, where it was recovered together with 6 seal impressions bearing the name of Sobekhotep IV and a ceramic assemblage of the 13th dynasty26. The clay used is fine and dark grey, and the sealing seems to have been fired. On the reverse of the cretula there are linear impressions from a wooden surface. Inv. Nr. 9446 N: R/III - q/6-7, Planum 2, Stratum b, L 338 (fig. 7) The place of origin of this seal impression is the same locus in which Inv. Nr. 9464 was found. Judg- ing from the part of the sealing preserved (the upper left sector of the impressed surface), the seal used for both impressions seems to have been the same. The clay is fine and grey and the reverse of the sealing shows rope impressions. Inv. Nr. 9452 R: R/III - r/7, Planum 2-3, Stratum b, L 66 (fig. 8) Only the upper part of this sealing is preserved. It could have been stamped using the same matrix of the other Khyan seal impressions found at R/III (except Inv. Nr. 9465). Nevertheless - if it is not the result of a deformation occurred on the moist cretula - a slight difference in the dimensions and in the distance between the two paired vertical ele- ments, dividing the field into three columns, sug- gests the - though remote - possibility that a second very similar matrix was in use for the same ruler. The clay is the same fine type used for the other 22 Design class 7B3 (ii) or 7C3 (ii), Tufnell, 1984, Pl. XXXI- XXXII; Ben-Tor, 2007, 143-144.

The reverse of the cretula shows rope impressions and a rounded wooden surface. Inv. Nr. 9466 N: R/III - s/6, Planum 3, Stratum c, L 325 (fig. 9) This seal impression is the last one of this group of materials that can be attributed to king Khyan. It belongs to a group of 15 sealings found in the same layer. Although, in this case, the impression is clearly altered by the deformation - probably caused by the removal of the still moist cretula - the matrix used to seal might be the same as Inv. Nr. 9464, 9466, and 9446 N. Here only the upper part of the tripartite sealing is preserved, with the whole titu- lary, the first hieroglyph of the royal name and the two uppermost rnh of the formula whm rnh. The clay is fine, grey and possibly fired. The reverse shows rope impressions, and features indicating the sealing of a wooden object: a wooden box or chest. Inv. Nr. 9467: R/III - r/6, Planum 0-1, Stratum a, L 13 (fig. 10) This consists of only the upper half of the impres- sion. It shows two cobras addorsed and linked27 with a cartouche between them. Above the cartou- che appears a decorative motif made up of two šwt "feathers" flanking a papyrus stem. The cartouche seems to bear the prenomen of Apophis ri-wsr-rfli, written with a corruption of ri in n29. The closest parallels for the cartouche are Tufnell, 1984, PL LXII: 3456-9, 3460 and especially 3441 and 3453, though none of these displays addorsed and linked cobras in connection with Apophis' royal name. Cobras appear - though not as part of a pair - on some Apophis' seals (Tufnell, 1984, PI. LXII: 3437, 3442, 3443, 3446), but the scarab design class cobras addorsed2,9 shows closer parallels for this iconography in association with cartouches, although usually containing only formulae or pseu- do-hieroglyphs31. The clay used for Inv. Nr. 9467 is fine and grey. The sealing could have been fired, possibly not intentionally, judging from the varying colour of the surface. The reverse of the cretula shows traces of use for textiles. Conclusions The seal impressions bearing the name of Khyan or part of his titulary (9464, 9466, 9446 N, 9452 R, 9466 N) as well as the possible one of Apophis - both rulers of the 15th dynasty - represent termini post quos for the dating of the building. Likewise, a preliminary study of the pottery showed that stra- ta b-c may be dated to the late Second Intermediate Period32. From these strata, not only 15th dynasty but also some 13th dynasty seal impressions were found. The 13th dynasty material could be inter- preted as residual or, on the other hand, it may suggest that older seals remained in use into later periods33, showing either the continuity of admin- istrative practices from the 13th to the 15th dynasty at Avaris - which somehow referred to earlier us- ages - or the appropriation/use of older seals34. On this subject, the recent discoveries at Tell Edfu need to be taken into consideration for the interpretation of the archaeological contexts related to the Khyan seal impressions at both sites35. The seal impressions from Strata b-c bearing the name of Khyan seem to come from dumping layers and to be in secondary deposition contexts. Simi- larly, royal Hyksos sealings were found in second- ary contexts in the Tuthmoside layers of the palace district of cEzbet Helmi. Nine cretulae, bearing the impression of the Hyksos ruler Yaqubhar, coun- tersealed one time by a 13th dynasty official's seal, and one other by a seal representing a crocodile 27 Design class 3Blb, Tufnell, 1984, Pl.

Such examples could sug- gest the practice of (re)using older stamp seals or the possibility that some sealed containers were kept in the store houses of the city and unsealed only when there was a demand for the material they contained38. The seal impression from the Stratum g (Inv. Nr. 9465), which was reached in the test trench, comes from a layer that, according to a preliminary study of the ceramic assemblage, may be dated to the early 15th dynasty39. If compared to the other sealings of Khyan recovered at R/III, it shows a different design: three paired scrolls along each side40 substitute the three signs in the panels delimiting the central field41 and the royal name is inscribed in a cartouche. One possible interpreta- tion for the two seal types of the same king is that, they were used for two different administrative op- erations. One other possibility is that, they were not in use at the same time. In this case, Inv. Nr. 9465 could have been in use before the adoption of a new royal-seal, the one attested on the most of the im- pressions described above. The high number of seal impressions recovered at R/III may suggest that the area was an adminis- trative/economic quarter, and the presence of seal impressions bearing names of two Hyksos rulers would speak in favour of an administrative district in some way connected to the centralized power. Assuming that the sealing activity testifies to trans- actions involving goods, the quarter could have been part of a redistribution centre of the city of Avaris. Of course this study is still far from complete. The seal impressions presented here are only a small part of the total and these results represent simply the first steps in a comprehensive study. Many different strands of research need to be un- dertaken to achieve a fuller understanding of the sealings and the area in which they were found. 36 Design class 9D, Ben-Tor, 2007, 177. The seal is described as bearing a Late Hyksos Period motif, (Bietak, 2004, 49). According to Ben-Tor, it is attributable to the Late Palestin- ian Series (late MB IIB generally referred to as MB IIC) Ben-Tor, 2007, 155. For a different interpretation and dating of this seal: Ryholt, 2010, 124. 37 Bietak, 2004, 49. 38 ivi, 54. This interpretation was considered the most probable one by the author. 39 See Forstner Müller -Rose same volume. 40 Design class 7B3, Ben-Tor, 2007, 143. 41 Design class 3E1, Ben-Tor, 2007, 86-87.
