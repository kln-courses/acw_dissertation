<plain_text><page sequence="1">Natural Kinds and Manifest Forms of Life* J. van Brakel** Summary In this paper I try to make sense of and give provisional answers to question like: Are there interesting theories about natural kinds (distinguishing them form other kinds)? Are some classifications or categorisations more natural than others? Does it matter whether or not there are natural kinds? To get an initial feel for the subject let's consider some suggestions from the literature as to what might count as a candidate for a natural kind or natural kind term. In an influential paper, Putnam 1975 wrote: "the extension of . . . 'natural kind words' ... is not fixed by a set of criteria laid down in advance but is, in part, fixed by the world. There are objective laws obeyed by multiple sclerosis, by gold, by horses, by electricity; and what is rational to include in these classes will depend on what those laws turn out to be." So the suggestion is that chemical substances, biological kinds, physical magnitudes and illnesses are natural kinds. Kripke 1980 uses similar examples adding the colour yellow; hence colours would also be natural kinds. In Quine's influential paper "Natu- ral Kinds" (1969) colour is the prime example, but Hacking 1991:115 says: "No one in the great tradition of natural kinds has seriously regarded colours * Earlier versions were presented at a Colloquium of the Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Logik und Philosophie der Wissenschaften in Bern (Switzerland) and at the University of Nijmegen (Netherlands). I am grateful for stimulating discussions on both occasions and for written comments on earlier versions from C.Z. Eglin, S. Haack, and F. Weinert. ** Department of Philosophy, P.O. Box 80.126, 3584 TC Utrecht (The Netherlands). Dialéctica Vol. 46, N° 3-4 (1992)</page><page sequence="2">244 J- van Brakel as natural kinds."3 Hacking lists as possible examples of natural kinds "all sorts of animals, vegetables, minerals, insects and fish" as well as "stone" and "stomach", being rather sceptical about Putnam's electricity and multiple sclerosis. He also thinks that social kinds (kinds of people, their behaviour and creations) should be kept apart from natural kinds. However Boyd 1991 argues against Hacking that most or many social kinds are natural kinds. In his view, any kind that functions in induction or explanation makes a claim to be a natural kind. Conversely Wilkerson 1988 would dispute that "vegetable" or "stone" is a natural kind. Such entities afford only superficial knowledge, not detailed scientific analysis. Wilkerson himself puts great emphasis on biologi- cal kinds like wolves or oaks. But Dupré 1989 points out that virtually all examples Wilkerson gives do not name scientific kinds, i.e. biological species or higher taxa. Moreover, the majority of biologists and philosophers of biol- ogy deny that species are natural kinds', they are instead hisorical individ- uals. 4 Returning to Kripke, Putnam, and the common sense view that water, gold, and tiger are prototypical natural kinds, Churchland 1985 argues that these are merely practical kinds. As "genuine natural kinds" he lists "mass, length, duration, charge, colour, energy, momentum." Why is there such disagreement? Obviously it is due to a difference in opi- nion on how to separate natural from other kinds. But it is also due to co- minglings with other discussions in the philosophy of science and elsewhere, for example about induction, prototypes, universais, scientific realism, meaning and reference, and so on. To order the discussion about different ap- proaches to natural kinds I will distinguish the Metaphysical (or First Philos- 3 Hacking's "great tradition" consists of Mill, Peirce, and Russell. Note that Quine 1969 considers both 'water' and 'red' mass terms. Here I'll pass over distinctions between mass nouns, count nouns, and predicates as well as priority disputes between monists and dualists about individuals and "sorts" (substances, universais) (see Armstrong 1978, Lowe 1989, Wig- gins 1980). 4 There is a variety of biological species definitions (see contributions in Ereshefsky 1991), but almost all share the assumption (supported by evolutionary biology) that species are li- neages; i.e. spatiotemporally continuous (or historical) entities. For dissenting views see Johnson 1990, Kitcher 1984 and Ruse 1987. Arguments for species as individuals are: There are no interesting biological characteristics all individuals of a species share; there are no biol- ogical laws governing specific species; species are historically restricted in time and place; species properties are essentially variable (according to evolutionary theory).</page><page sequence="3">Natural Kinds and Manifest Forms of Life 245 ophy) Image, the Scientific (or Naturalistic) Image and the Manifest (or Prag- matic) Image (or Stance). 5 From the naturalistic point of view the way into the discussion about natu- ral kinds is via the problem of induction and the projectability of predicates. 6 This brings out at once the way in which empiricists and realists might take different attitudes on natural kinds. In particular, if we follow the realist's route, justification of induction via the assumed existence of natural kinds naturally leads to discussions about natural laws, and microreductionism. 7 And the idea of there being one world, the natural one, leads to fashionable idioms like talk of supervenience. The Manifest Image approach comes in many guises. One manifest entry is via ordinary language philosophers, now almost extinct, who believe that natural kinds are embedded in language, having been refined during millen- nia of common sense. More recently this approach has come to the fore as a variant of naturalism about common sense basic-level categories like "robin", "red", and "angry" and the catch-phrases are prototypes, linguistic universais and their neurophysiological grounding. 8 On the metaphysical route we find modern theories of universais like Armstrong's, and revivals of an Artistotelian sort. With the increased domin- ance of naturalism these classical ideas too need support from science. This applies as much to Kripke/ Putnam type Aristotelian essences as to Arm- strong's universais. 9 As is apparent from my characterisation of the Scientific, Manifest, and Metaphysical Image, in all three cases the influence of naturalism is domi- 5 I use the term 'manifest' in a broad sense; in suitable contexts it may be taken to have the connotation of pragmatic, common sense, folk psychology, folk physics, daily talk, and similar expressions. I retain the original association of the opposition between the Manifest and the Scientific Image as introduced by Sellars (compare Putnam 1987:3-8). The term 'pragmatic' is used roughly in the sense of Dewey, James, Putnam and Rorty (but see van Brakel and Saunders 1989), but should also be associated with "use" theories of meaning. There is ground to refer to "Manifest Images" in analogy to the question whether there is one or more human forms of life. 6 Projectable predicates name properties that one can (learn to) inductively project from a sample to a population. 7 See Hacking 1991 and Boyd 1991 for a quick survey of views on natural kinds in the past few centuries from the perspectives of realism and empiricism and Haack 1992b for a compari- son of the views of Peirce, Quine, Goodman, and Putnam. 8 The most detailed proposal of this kind is for colour; see Hardin 1988, Lakoff 1987, and MacLaury 1992 and for criticisms Saunders 1992 and van Brakel 1992. 9 For Aristotelian-type essences see Kripke 1980, Putnam 1975 (but see Putnam 1990), and Leplin 1988; and for modern universais Armstrong 1979, 1991; Lewis 1983.</page><page sequence="4">246 J- van Brakel nant. 10 As it will turn out, my preference is for the Manifest Image, but not in the way I've just characterised it. Before turning to proposed criteria for natural kinds, I'll first review one of the many issues in which presuppositions about natural kinds hover in the background. One reason for the increased interest in natural kinds in the phil- osophy of science is the concern about incommensurability. Incommensu- rability might be seen as a consequence of a Fregean theory of reference (ac- cording to which sense determines reference), combined with the Quinean idea of meaning holism. An antidote to the virus of incommensurability or relativism might be the Kripke/Putnam causal theory of reference (CTR for short), which allows sense to go all over the place, while stipulating reference to be stable. Roughly one might say: If we drop Fregean eternal universais (sort of natural kinds or knowledge parcels all humans try equally to grasp) we end up with incommensurable Kuhnian worlds. CTR saves the one world by replacing the human independent Third Realm of Frege with a human inde- pendent world of natural kinds. 11 Perhaps the staunchest defender of CTR in the philosophy of science is Leplin 1988. He says: CTR operates under the assumption that things sufficiently distinguish- able and reidentifiable to bear names have 'nature', that there is in prin- ciple a distinction between their true and apparent natures, that there is such a thing as what they really are which science attempts to learn and about which we may be ignorant or mistaken while yet succeeding in referring to them . . . The requirement CTR imposes on science is ... to discover what the ob- jects into which we linguistically divide the world really are . . . We do not stabilise a term's reference by associating certain properties with continued use of the term. It is rather the world, independently of our linguistic predilections, that dictates the conditions for retention of reference. The essence on which reference depends is, then, metaphysi- cal in that it need not be an experientially accessible feature of the refer- ent .. . Every specification CTR makes of what it takes to be the referent of a natural kind term brackets the proviso that science is right. In effect, CTR appeals to 'final science' for determinations of essential properties. 10 I take naturalism in the sense of physicalism; I doubt whether there are other clear forms of naturalism. Cf. Quine 1992: "Naturalism looks only to natural science, however fallible, for an acount of what there is The world is as natural science says it is, insofar as natural science is right." For a criticism of the ambiguity of the reference of the term 'natural science' see Crane and Mellor 1990. 11 There have of course been many other rationalistic and naturalistic answers to the prob- lem of incommensurability. Here I concentrate on the discussions about CRT.</page><page sequence="5">Natural Kinds and Manifest Forms of Life 247 CTR is not, of course, without problems, and acknowledged as such by Leplin, though here I'll pass over them. 12 A more general question is whether CTR or another theory of meaning can enlighten the nature of 'meaning' and 'meaning change' in science. Naturalist philosophers of science will often answer: no. The point is stated forcefully by Nersessian 1991 in response to Leplin 1988: Thus far, all philosophical theories of meaning have failed to enlighten us on the nature of 'meaning' and 'meaning change' as these pertain to scientific theories; perhaps it is time we question the method of analysis that has given rise to these theories. ... I propose to ground under- standing of 'meaning' and 'meaning change' as they pertain to science in studies of the practices employed in real changes of conceptual structure in science. The message is clear: the linguistic turn of the sort that provides general theories of meaning, leads into a cul-de-sac, at least as far as the philosophy of science is concerned. It's time for true naturalism. The view has been defended vehemently by Shapere in a large number of papers. He too feels that the problem of incommensurability is an artefact of an incorrect theory of meaning. However, in his view, there's no need for another First Philosophy solution, like CTR. All changes of meaning during the development of science are piecemeal, every change being supported by justifiable reasons: "continuity of reference [is] established by there being reasons for changing the body of properties ascribed to an entity or type of entity." For example: "the unity of the 'electron tradition' is provided by the chain of reasoning that led to the successive additions, deletions, and modifications in what was said of electrons, from Stoney to the latest developments in quantum field theory." 12 The main criticisms can perhaps be summarised as follows (see Churchland 1985, Johnson 1990, Kroon 1985, Nersessian 1991, Shapere 1991a, van den Brink and van Brakel 1988, van Brakel 1986, and references given there): 1. CTR assumes that the reference of natural kind terms is fixed by a baptismal event, though the object to which I point can always be variously interpreted. In the case of perceptual contact a certain degree of conceptualisation of the causal environment is necessary to fix the reference; perceptual contact underdetermines reference. 2. Concrete CTR-definitions of natural kinds appear to contain essential references to local cir- cumstances and points of view. 3. CTR has difficulty explaining cases where science completely abandons the entity to which a terms refers. When scientific terms (e.g. 'positron') have their reference fixed theoretically, for example by mathematical desiderata, the explanatory theory overdetermines reference (and it may later turn out that nothing fits the specified causal role). 4. In interpreting the history of a term's usage CTR asks us to be charitable in assuming that the intention of all involved was to point to the same natural kind all the way. But why is continuity more deserving of our charity than discontinuity?</page><page sequence="6">248 J- van Brakel Therefore the term 'electron' has a respectable transtheoretical use. Similar smooth accounts of piecemeal change supported by sound reasoning can be given for the wholesale abandonment of entities like phlogiston. 13 I agree that incommensurability is an artefact. As Shapere has pointed out, the thesis of incommensurability, in its more extreme forms, 14 is itself a form of essentialism: evident similarities between paradigms are relegated to the status of irrelevance, while differences are elevated to paramount importance. However, I believe naturalists are much too impressed by science. 15 As Leplin points out: 16 it is nothing short of dogma in Shapere and Nersessian that virtually all scientific change is rational, that chain-of-reasoning connections link virtually everything that happens in science with everything else that happens. This result ... is the unavoidable consequence of insisting that the very concepts 'reason' and 'reasoning', the very idea of 'ration- ality', are determined by whatever linkages the evolution of science happens to display, and are themselves subject to (wholesale) change with changes of substantive science. Although a number of issues still need to be sorted out, I can't do full jus- tice to them here, as I have to get on with criteria for natural kinds. But let me set a few pointers. Firstly, naturalists are right to say theories of meaning and reference are not very relevant to meaning change in science. As Elgin (1983:41) points out: "Any body of discourse [for example scientific discourse] can be syste- matised in a variety of ways, and for different purposes different systems may 13 All quotations in this paragraph are from Shapere 1991a where further references are given. Altough neither Shapere nor Nersessian see a place in the philosophy of science for the- ories of meaning of the sort discussed in the philosophy of language, I agree with Leplin 1988 that both appeal to a descriptive theory of reference, but without any part of the description being necessary. As descriptions never change whole-sale, any change can be supported by rea- sons. For a similar view see Weinert 1991: "reference-fixing is a historical, drawn-out process. This, however, does not stand in the way of successful reference." 14 Such extreme forms would not seem to be the ones currently advocated by Kuhn (1991:3): "Properly understood - something I've by no means always managed myself - in- commensurability is far from being the threat to rational evaluation of truth claims that it has frequently seemed. Rather, it's what is needed, within a development perspective, to restore some badly needed bite to the whole notion of cognitive evaluation." 15 It is unsurprising that Shapere is sympathetic to those scientists (Feynman, Hawking, Barlow) who refer to a "theory of everything" and he holds a strong belief in the Finalization Thesis: one day science will reach such a degree of maturity that no more significant scientific discoveries will be made. See in particular Shapere 1991b. Compare Rouse 1991 for a discus- sion of the "grand narrative legitimation of the history of science as a history of rationality". 16 Nersessian has pointed out (p.c.) that all scientific change is "reasoned" - though that is not the same as Leplin's " all scientific change is rational".</page><page sequence="7">Natural Kinds and Manifest Forms of Life 249 be appropriate." For the physicist, to say that Rutherford's theory of the atom is wrong (or at least not sufficiently right), it is irrelevant whether the history of use of the word 'electron' is described in Kuhnian or Putnamian terms. But then neither is there a fact of the matter (scientifically, metaphysically or otherwise) as to the reason why scientists favour one theory over another (or of the rational reason for a theory change as reconstructed from the luxury of hindsight). This is not to deny that physicists probably have had good reasons to favour, say, the Bohr model of the atom over that of Rutherford, though these were good reasons relative only to ongoing concerns about atoms and to what were considered good reasons among scientists at the time. They were/ are not good reasons relative to Rationality or The World. Secondly, the social part of CTR - Putnam's emphasis on the linguistic di- vision of labour - is correct, but not its metaphysical component. 17 As Put- nam's slogan goes: meanings ain't in the head; nor are they in a Third Realm. Worse, at least for CTR, they are not in the world either, other than as the sub- ject of passing token-interpretations of token-utterances or token-inscrip- tions in a social setting. 18 The entrenchment of (scientific) natural kinds (and other theoretical entities) has to be seen in this light: as constructions of com- municative interaction, continuously reconstructed. 19 This can be described as making progress, but only in Goodman's sense of making better worlds (or natural kinds) out of old ones; not in the sense of progress relative to some fixed natural kinds in a human independent world. 20 17 As I've argued elsewhere no principled distinction can be made between the stereotype and the essence (van Brakel 1986; see also Mellor 1977). 18 Meanings are assigned to bits of language, not by appealing to a theory of meaning or in- terpretation in which the meanings of a language have been codified, but by a "theory-in-flux" for interpreting idiolects. See on passing theories of interpretation Davidson 1986, 1990. For "identity" of meaning being merely pragmatic see Quine 1990 and van Brakel and Geurts 1988. 19 I'm thinking here primarily of Goodman (see also Elgin 1983); not Latour and other "constructionists". 20 On making worlds see Goodman 1978, 1984. The rationale for talking about more than one world is that a conceptual scheme (or language) sets the conditions for the individuation of the objects in its realm; it fixes for example the interpretation of 'is the same thing as'. If there is conceptual relativity (not "relativism" - see Putnam 1987) there are many worlds. See on the notion of scheme I'm using, Elgin 1983:37-42 (following Goodman). A scheme is any family of predicates which sorts the objects in a given domain or realm. The same scheme can organise different realms; different schemes may organise the same realm. If two schemes share a general identifying description of a realm then they share the realm, otherwise not; e.g. Aristotelian/ Darwinian schemes for "living things", Newtonian and Einsteinian schemes for physical objects and events. Descriptions of realms are of course themselves scheme-relative.</page><page sequence="8">250 J- van Brakel I'll return to these issues after reviewing criteria for identifying natural kinds: those properties natural kinds have and others don't. I'll divide the pro- posed criteria into four: 1. natural kinds and resemblance or similarity; 2. natural kinds and projectable predicates or laws of nature; 3. natural kinds and origin; 4. natural kinds and essences. That all four aspects or levels make some preliminary sense is clear if we con- sider the example of biological species. There are at least four ways of dividing organisms into groups. 21 Firstly, we may draw on morphological or pherhaps functional similarity. This is nearest to the approach of grouping together those things resembling one another in manifest characteristics - what Put- nam has called the stereotype. The seccond possible criterion is that of inter- breeding, which might be taken as a typical example of a projectable predicate involving laws or regularities of nature, but without much theoretical embed- ment. Thirdly, evolutionary theory in its neo-Darwinian form has led to the descent criterion of species. Here, what matters is the origin of the entity (whether a natural individual or kind). The fourth criterion, that of species as clusters of individuals bearing strong genetic similarities, is the archetype of a natural kind with an essence. Here what counts is underlying deep structure, not manifest similarities, macroscopic scientific projectables, or common origin. The example also shows that if we can't fit all four aspects into one uni- fied whole, the alternatives undermine the natural uniqueness of each. 22 With some ingenuity the same four-fold division can be applied to other types of natural kinds; to obvious ones like gold and water, as well as to less plausible ones like schizophrenia. But I'll now turn to a discussion of specific proposals to separate natural kinds from other kinds, considering arguments from similarity, projectability and essences respectively. 23 First similarity. As Quine 1969 says: "there is nothing more basic to thought and language than our sense of similarity; our sorting of things into kinds." I take it that no- 21 This partition, following Ruse 1987, is for illustrative purposes only and is not represen- tative of the variety of species concepts currently in vogue, including interbreeding, phylo- genetic, ecological, structural (genetic, chromosomal, developmental) similarity, cladistic, phenetic, etc. approaches - some of which may overlap (see further Ereshefsky 1991, forthc.). 22 Ruse 1987 argues for a "consilience" of criteria, but most writers agree that biological kinds cannot fit all four criteria. For criticisms of Ruse and a plea for "species pluralism" see Ereshefsky forthc. Hacking 1991 provides a good example of the tension generated by wishing to fit everything in one world. He advocates an account of different kinds of natural kinds; for example, locally recognised folk species may not coincide with the biologist's species, although both are real. This however would seem to water down the idea of natural kind beyond control. 23 For reasons of space I leave the argument from origins for another occasion. Origins might be considered a special variant of essences.</page><page sequence="9">Natural Kinds and Manifest Forms of Life 251 body denies this. The problem is, it doesn't take us very far. Though we may have an innate flair for categorisation, it will apply equally to "natural" and "non-natural" kinds. 24 Quine also stresses that similarity has to be taken as a comparative notion; otherwise natural kinds could not be contained in other natural kinds. Moreover, as many have stressed, it is not similarity, but simi- larity in the same respect that is required. 25 The problem of tackling similarity in a sophisticated way can be ap- proached from the Naturalistic, the Manifest and the Metaphysical Stances. 26 The latter is exemplified by Armstrong. According to him: "resemblance can only be analysed in terms of respects of resemblance. Respects, in their turn, require to be explained by means of universais." He would like to explain why our ordinary predicates which seem natural, like 'length' and 'red', are natural. However: It is undeniable that different shades of red are different properties. It follows that redness is not a property common to all red things. ... To assert that a particular is red is to assert that the particular has some property, a property which is a member of a certain class of properties: the class of all the absolutely determinate shades of red. So Armstrong's metaphysical approach removes red (and colour too) as real properties or natural kinds. 'Red' does not mark a natural similarity, though each determinate shade of red does. These determinate colour shades are, contrary to introspection, complex properties: "perceived qualities and relations are as much epistemological icebergs as any other aspect of reality." This has the consequence that "we will seldom, perhaps never, know what ac- tual property the thing has, that is, what determinate shade of red it has." Simi- 24 Quine adds: "A standard of similarity is in some sense innate." But as Elgin has pointed out (p.c.) the capacity to find things similar doesn't require there to be any particular standard of similarity to be innate; the standards we end up using may not be the ones we started with. 25 Quine himself says: "Still one would like to be able to show that a single general simi- larity ... is all we need, and that respects can be abstracted afterward." 26 Quine exemplifies the Naturalistic Image. An example of the manifest approach is proto- type theory, which, at least in some of its guises, implies that there are basic-level categories like water and red. These are natural categories because given the way the world and our neurophy- siology etc is, there is no other alternative than to arrive at such categories. As I have discussed prototype theory at length elsewhere (van Brakel 1991a) I won't pursue it here. The root meta- phor of prototypes (as opposed to strict categorical definitions) is now generally accepted. Compare, in the present context, Nersessian's 1991 reference to "salient features"; Boyd's 1991 "homeostatic property clusters"; Quine's 1969 "paradigm-and-foil definition" (referring to Carnap). Cf. also Russell's "notion of closeness to be explained" (quoted in Hacking 1991).</page><page sequence="10">252 J- van Brakel larly, "it may turn out, there is no such thing as length, but simply appearances of particulars having lengths, because there are no lengths at all." 27 From a more strictly naturalistic perspective (like Quine's), Armstrong's approach seems a lost cause from the start. It is clear from his writings that 're- semblance' should not be taken in a psychological sense. 28 At best perceptual similarities ("epistemological icebergs") will lead us to metaphysical resem- blances, which, in the end, should "reduce" to naturalistic universais. On a naturalistic view there cannot be a metaphysical world apart from the natural world. So it's science which should in the end encompass Armstrong's meta- physical universais (e.g. the absolutely determinate shades of red). But if the naturalistic ladder from psychology to physics is climbed (and thrown away), it's not clear why it doesn't lead straight to the top floor of cosmic relevance. Here we meet Quine 1969 again, who without substituting deeper "respects of resemblance" argues convincingly that advanced science transcends all superficial similarities. 29 We might be taken in by the argument for eliminating colour because physics has had trouble with so called secondary qualities since Galilei; but if colour goes (because of its cosmic irrelevance), so too does water and ice cubes - pink, or otherwise. 30 A serious naturalistic approach won't rest until the whole of the Manifest Image has been naturalised away. So, on both the "superficial" manifest approach and on the "thorough-going" metaphysical or metaphysical cum naturalistic approach there's no such thing as "natural similarity". Psychologically "seeing similarities" works on anything and Quine's naturalistic approach shows that advanced science can do without natural kinds. Both his "cosmic argument" and Armstrong's universais fail to support a substantial distinction between natural kinds and others, at least for any kind of kind known by ordinary people.31 27 Quotations in this paragraph are from Armstrong 1979, pp. 57, 117, 126, 117, 119 re- spectively. See also p. 98: "It is possible to recognize resemblances and yet to be unable to de- tect in what respect the particulars concerned resemble each other." 28 For Armstrong (1979:95): "resemblance is always identity of nature" (also: "is based upon nature"). 29 Quine 1969: "In this career of the similarity notion, starting in its innate phase, develo- ping over the years in the light of accumulated experience, passing then from the intuitive phase into theoretical similarity, and finally disappearing altogether, we have a paradigm of the evol- ution of unreason into science." 30 The pink ice cubes are the ones Sellars' Scientific Image would eliminate from the Mani- fest Image; cf. Putnam 1987: If. 31 In Armstrong 1983, contrary to the account given above, he says that "perhaps deter- minable universais can be admitted on a selective basis" (p. 115); for example "mass" is now considered a "higher-order universal", but "[f]or reasons of scientific detail, colour is a confus- ing case" (Armstrong, in Bogdan 1984:258).</page><page sequence="11">Natural Kinds and Manifest Forms of Life 253 I now move to the second cluster of criteria, concerning the role of natural kinds in relation to induction, natural laws and explanations. I start by quoting a few characterisations that have been given. The 1991 Handbook of Meta- physics and Ontology says that natural kinds appeal to a criterion of identity of properties as "occupying the same causal role in nature" or "having the same place in an ultimate scientific account of the world" (Levinson 1991). Or, starting more modestly (Dupré 1986): "There is certainly no harm in call- ing a set of objects that are found to have a substantial number of shared properties a natural kind." 32 The shared properties can then be given meta- physical work to do by playing a part in prediction, explanation, physical laws and causality. For example: "Some kinds are, at the very least, more natural than others . . . because ... we can make numerous further reliable predictions about it" (Dupré 1986). Or: "natural kinds are the sets that one picks out in giving explanations" (Kitcher 1984). Or: "a taxonomy consists of entities that are the nodes of causal processes" (Ereshefsky forthc.). Or: "By a 'natural kind', I mean a spatiotemporally unrestricted or repeatable category inelimi- natively presupposed by at least one true and explanatory law of nature" (Johnson 1990). Let's first consider projectable properties (or predicates), //there are natu- ral kinds then their properties, or at least some of their properties, are project- able. But having projectable properties doesn't make something into a natural kind, as the concept is normally understood. I can predict/project how, in given circumstances, all of the following entities will behave: water, oak, tiger, policeman, car, red paint, red after image, angry person, schizophrenic per- son, army, etc. Of course some predictions seem more reliable than others, but none are either absolutely guaranteed or completely arbitrary. In all cases there are ceteris paribus considerations and other uncertainties. 33 Similarly, a kind like vovetas, a category of the Native American Cheyenne which in- cludes most vultures, some hawks, two types of insects and tornado's, has many projectable predicates; the same applies to refrigerators or the Kwakw'ala word Ihenxa which, amongst other things, refers to the kind of "colour" a yellow banana and a green apple share.34 We can think up the 32 As Hacking 1991 notes, there is a tension between requiring that the instantiations of a natural kind should have many properties in common (as advocated by Mill and Russell) and the aim of science to relateall these properties to one base property (as pointed out by Peirce). The tension might be resolved by defining a natural kind as a "knot of similarities connected in a lawful way" (Haack 1992b, presenting this as Peirce's view.) Compare also Armstrong 1991: "epistemically aboriginal kinds ... are families of universais that are reasonably closely-knit". 33 For arguments that this is also the case for things like water see van Brakel 1986, forthc. 34 For a discussion of vovetas see van Brakel 1991a and for Ihenxa Saunders 1992.</page><page sequence="12">254 J- van Brakel weirdest kinds which all have projectable properties (Hirsch 1988). That some kinds just seem more natural is because of their deeper entrenchment. So, if this is to lead anywhere for the natural kind theorist, we need more constraints. This is where the requirement comes in that natural kind proper- ties shouldn't be merely projectable, but should function in "proper" scientific laws. 35 The point presumably is not that natural kinds or their properties are governed by scientific laws; after all, on the naturalistic view everything, how- ever artificial or peculiar, is governed by scientific laws. The point must be that natural kinds figure prominently in the fundamental laws of science. But stressing the prominence of that role in fundamental science leads down to the slippery slope of Quinean ontological reductionism on which natural kinds are eliminated by science. To use an old Popperian terminology: on a thorough-going naturalistic view all natural kinds stem from a dogmatic attitude. A critical attitude how- ever removes them: first the metaphysical, moral, affective, and secondary kinds go; then the biological kinds - think of them merely as historical indi- viduals, haphazard results of natural selection. Chemical substances and ele- ments are soon to follow, being framed on unwarranted anthropomorphic ideas about atoms and individuality (molecules aren't things at all, they don't even have shape). Finally we are left with a world composed of quarks, and even they may have to go at the final naturalisation of science. 36 I believe this to be a consistent line of reasoning and wouldn't be surprised if in the near future it leads to the abstract turn (following the linguistic and naturalistic turns), so that Pythagoras was right after all. Should we accept therefore that all there is to the familiar manifest image is a bunch of charac- teristics of the number 10 39? 37 Many naturalists are reluctant to go this far, if only because numbers have to be naturalised away. But where to stop? Mere projectability doesn't draw 35 This leads to discussions for and against a Humean perspective on laws - less relevant to me as I don't believe there are even contingent regularities: all allegedly universal statements are ceteris paribus. At the very least this applies to the laws in which "ordinary" natural kinds figure. For arguments against strict physical laws see Cartwright 1983, Hempel 1988, Scheibe 1991, van Brakel forthc. Whether laws may exist that apply to the whole universe (and perhaps other real or possible universes) depends on how one takes the concept of chance (van Brakel 1991b). 36 Quine 1992: "My tentative ontology continues to consist of quarks and their com- pounds, also classes of such things, classes of such classes, and so on, pending evidence to the contrary." 37 Ďirac 1939: "If we express the present epoch, 2 x 109 years, in terms of a unit of time defined by the atomic constants, we get a number of the order 1039, which characterises the present in an absolute sense. Might it not be that all present events correspond to properties of this large number, and, more generally, that the whole history of the universe corresponds to properties of the whole sequence of natural numbers?"</page><page sequence="13">Natural Kinds and Manifest Forms of Life 255 interesting boundaries; projectable properties are always ceteris paribus (so called "causes" apply locally, provided there are no opposing forces). So, the appeal to the "self-evidence" of causality sets no interesting constraints on our classification schemes; causal structure only sets substantial constraints within a scheme. Of course we may break this apparent arbitrariness by falling back on a Metaphysical Image, which is what various types of realists do. Typically Boyd 1991 says: 38 Even for the purposes of guessing we need categories of substance whose boundaries are not (or not just) 'the workmanship of the under- standing'. . . . Kinds useful for induction or explanation must always 'cut the world at its joints' in this sense: successful induction and expla- nation always require that we accommodate our categories to the cau- sal structure of the world. The appeal to categories of substance and underlying microstructure brings me to the third cluster of criteria for natural kinds: they have essential properties, the properties that attach to an object in any possible world, or throughout any possible change in which the object endures. They are what the real definition of an entity provides. A good example is offered by Wilker- son 1988, who ties together the idea of projectable predicates with that of es- sences. 39 He ssays that natural kinds are characterised by real essences, instrinsic properties that make the individuals the kind of things they are, and which lend themselves to detailed scientific investigation . . . The real essence of a thing not only determines its proper de re classification . . ., but also directly deter- mines many of its properties . . . irrespective of any system of classifi- cation we may find it convenient to adopt . . . Nature, as it were, pro- vides the system of classification, whether or not we have the wit to use it. In a way this view leads us back through the whole discussion. Just as there are lots of truly alternative predicates that are projectable, so we may also con- template truly alternative natural kinds, each with its own essence. The idea that an essence is an underlying trait on which the more manifest properties 38 Boyd 1989 says: "the materialist realist need not in every case hold that epistemic priority belongs to the physicist . . . scientific realism . . . is highly non-reductionistic". It would seem then that the world has different joints, depending on one's epistemic point of view. Any epistemic point of view could have its own natural kinds (vultures or vovetas, etc.). 39 Compare Armstrong (1978:66): "Behind the set of "surface" properties there is a set of more deeply hidden properties: the real essence of the natural kind." "The laws which a thing obeys are ... in a sense part of its essence" (Armstrong, in Bogdan 1984:261).</page><page sequence="14">256 J- van Brakel supervene can be used in any scheme. The essence of 'tiger' could be the dy- namic tiger gestalt, its functional organisation, its genetic structure, its eco- logical niche, all of this, or none. The essence of schizophrenia could be a genetic abnormality or a type of double-bind; or it could be the wrong do- pamine level, a general synaptic loosening, or a broken ego. The essence of green could be one thing and of Ihenxa another; similarly for vultures and vovetas. You might object that colours, let alone Ihenxa , schizophrenia, or double binds, are no good as examples of natural kinds. But if we restrict natural kinds to deep scientific kinds, then as we have seen, no natural kinds worth speaking of remain. On the other hand, if we do allow more than one scheme, each scheme may provide its own essences. Let's take stock. Criteria for natural kinds like resemblance, figuring in natural laws, or having essences tend to presuppose the distinction between natural and non-natural kinds. 40 However, it doesn't follow that the distinc- tion is without value. For example a discussion about whether species are natural kinds or natural individuals or neither, may be very useful in the con- text of furthering the science of biology. So while such distinctions are fine, they remain within a scheme (which provides important background "gi- vens"; for example: whatever you propose, it has to fit the facts of evolution). Another scheme might draw the line quite differently between natural kinds and other kinds, or between natural kinds and other natural categories, or be- tween natural kinds and natural individuals, none of which invalidates the dis- tinction drawn in a particular scheme. So, the choice is not for or against natu- ral kinds: the choice is between one or many schemes or worlds. Or, if you would prefer, between one or many forms of life. 41 That is to say, we're con- fronted with the following dilemma: Either we allow kinds like Ihenxa or vovetas to be natural kinds, having projectable properties, essences, or what- ever else goes with being a natural kind. Or, if we want to deny Ihenxa and vovetas this status, we're pushed all the way down the path to hard reduction- ism. This path has the following pointers: Natural kinds [i] share a large (pos- sibly infinite) number of characteristics, [ii] which hang together, [iii] lend themselves to scientific investigation, [iv] can be explained in terms of micro- properties, [v] have as essences the final microreductive properties, [vi] the latter providing the structure of the world. I see no way of stopping half-way 40 The problem of separating natural kinds from other kinds is rather similar to Quine's analysis of separating analytic from synthetic statements. Quine's approach in his natural kinds article is similar to that in his "two dogma's" paper. 41 Here, broadly speaking 'scheme' refers to Goodman and Putnam; 'world' refers to Goodman; and 'form of life' to Wittgenstein. Roughly a conceptual scheme in Goodman's and Putnam's sense corresponds to a language in Davidsonian terminology.</page><page sequence="15">Natural Kinds and Manifest Forms of Life 257 or spreading out into a multiplicity of autonomous schemes or domains which nonetheless are dependent on one physicalistic base (which is what superveni- ence aims to achieve). 42 Many naturalists tend to say or assume there's one ontology of (physical) objects and different levels at which the properties can be described. Sometimes this is expressed in the slogan: ontological reduc- tionism plus conceptual autonomy. But on what is the preference for objects in the basic ontology based? 43 What are the objects of quantum mechanics (or quantum field theories)? Similarly, though iťs a naturalistic assumption that everything has a physical description, why can't everything have, say, a physi- cal description and a mental description and a moral description? 44 1 know of no good answers to such questions. What does the alternative picture of many worlds look like? Any concep- tual scheme (whether manifest, scientific, or metaphysical) has to fit a world, but [i] this world is a co-production of many schemes; [ii] alternative schemes can be as good, better, or worse relative to some other scheme. So, we're al- ways working with many schemes at once. It would therefore be wrong to say that a scheme has to fit its world. The idea of 'fitting' the world always de- pends on many schemes. There are schemes at different levels, for different domains, expressed in other languages, and for other cultures - where words like 'different', 'level', 'domain', 'language', 'culture', etc. (and their "relatives" in other languages) may figure in an unlimited number of schemes. It doesn't make sense, other than for a particular purpose, to limit the discussion to one scheme, say a microreductionist physicalist world scheme or an individualist concept of self scheme. Any such limited discussion is grounded in a multile- velled, multidomained, multischemed, multi-idiolect, and usually multi-eth- nic and multi-cultural form of life. In this way both the Metaphysical and Naturalistic Image are limited in a way the Manifest Image is not. All schemes are "passing", no matter whether we take them as theories, languages, cognitive models, or something else. Any codifying is merely a re- 42 For the concept of supervenience, in particular its relation to microreductionism, see Kim 1988. For a critical assessment of the supervenience paradigm see van Brakel forthc. 43 Cf Quine 1992: "The very notion of an object at all, concrete or abstract, is a human con- tribution, a feature of our inherited apparatus for organising the amorphous welter of neural input. . . . The reification of bodies comes in stages in one's acquisition of language, each suc- cessive stage being more clearly and emphatically an affirmation of existence." Moreover, to say that the world consists of physical objects implies that these objects can be distinguished be- cause of the different ways they affect our senses (directly or via some instrument). These dif- ferences are differences in a certain respect; hence to make distinctions presupposes properties. Hence, to identify objects in the first place we need properties. At least we should say that the creation of objects and properties is a co-production (cf. Lowe 1989, Wiggins 1980). 44 Davidson's anomalous monism might imply that all physical events are also mental events (Davidson 1980:212; cf Janssens and van Brakel 1990). For the suggestion that if "everything" supervenes on the physical then "everything" supervenes on the moral see Miller 1990.</page><page sequence="16">258 J- van Brakel visable convention, subject to numerous passing schemes affording ideas about codification and convention. Similarities between schemes crop up and disappear. Any sharp distinction between two schemes is only sharp relative to another scheme providing the criterion for sharpness and a background of others saying something about 'criteria'. Does such a view allow for progress in science? That depends: In which scheme is the question being asked? In most familiar schemes the answer is yes. 45 But there's no absolute answer. One reason is that ideas about ration- ality, about what good reasons are, and about (scientific) progress are con- tinuously re-constructed in communication. Moreover, such ideas cannot be understood in any significant way without recognising the moral aspect of ra- tionality and communication. This moral aspect in particular is grounded in the Manifest Image, the manifest form of life. So the Manifest Image is prior to everything, including a posteriori discoveries in science like the Theory of Everything. Natural kinds discovered by science are made by regrouping traditional natural kinds and by fabricating more natural kinds through conceptual re- construction of the structure of regrouped natural kinds, their properties, and their relations. Even if we allow an independent world, containing a mix of causality and randomness, there would be no specific joints to be cut, not at any level of analysis. The progress of science is built on a projectable sequence of projectable predicates (including "meta" predicates), which in the end, at the supra-meta-level are entrenched in the Manifest Image. 46 Think of quan- tum mechanics. As Bohr stressed, there is no way of testing the predictions of quantum mechanics without appealing to macroscopic objects and colloquial language to describe experiments. 47 Similarly, sociobiologists (amongst others) might argue that "proximate" phenomena like human communica- 45 As Haack 1992a puts it: "Science, in my view, is not privileged epistemically; it is only rather distinguished from an epistemic point of view." To which it should be added that 'epi- stemic' can be characterised using a variety of schemes. As Moser, usually described as an epi- stemologica! foundationalist, says (1991): "appealing to anything X (e.g., natural kinds, universais, reliable mechanisms, physical features) to provide justification presupposes a prior notion of justification relative to which X can and does provide justification." 46 Of course I'm not denying that, in the twentieth century, in most cultures, the Scientific Image has thoroughly impregnated the Manifest Image. But in the end this interaction is subject to moral judgments, which, except in Brave New World (Putnam 1987, van Brakel 1991a), are grounded in the Manifest Image. The fact that "we" tend to accept scientific explanations over "traditional" folk explanations is in the end grounded in ideas about rationality grounded in the Manifest Image. The suggestion of a bootstrap method is no more than the entrenchment of a particular sequence. The description of the bootstrap is itself a claim to projection, which, in order to appreciate it, draws on numerous manifest schemes. 47 See for example Bell's comments on Bohr's ideas in Bernstein 1991 and many of Bohr's more philosophical publications.</page><page sequence="17">Natural Kinds and Manifest Forms of Life 259 tion or morality can be explained in terms of "ultimate" causes (and perhaps some "ultimate randomness"?), but the criteria used to evaluate sociobiologi- cal theory would still be based, at least in part, on ordinary contemporary standards of what is reasonable, and what is not. Should we then give priority to a naturalised Manifest Image, based on basic-level categories, manifest natural kinds, closely tied to the senses, grounded in or at least severely constrained by our neurophysiology and fur- ther grounded in evolutionary biology or epigenetic rules? I don't think so (van Brakel 1991a, 1992). No doubt the capacity to discriminate differences has developed evolutionarily in such a way that organisms and their environ- ment live in some kind of symbiosis or ecological consilience. But, as I noted above in connection with the idea of resemblance, these capacities do not fix specific joints at the conceptual level. Survival has little to do with truth and realism and a lot with luck and tinkering. REFERENCES Armstrong, D.M.
