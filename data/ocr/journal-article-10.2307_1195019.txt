<plain_text><page sequence="1">REASONS FOR BELIEVING IN GOD WALTER M. HORTON Union Theological Seminary Admitting that the idea of God arises through an imaginative process of thought which attributes our interests to a supposed Cosmic Being, this article attempts to analyze more closely the validity of this process. It is indisputable that our life is what it is because of its response to stimuli. What are the stimuli which occasion religicus beliefs ? There seems to be no valid reason for restricting cosmic stimuli to mere mechanical forces. Taking all the facts of experience into account, the most reasonable hypothesis is the affirmation of personal factors in the total cosmic environment. Skepticism as to the existence of God is compared with the solipsistic skepticism as to the reality of an external world. I take it that the modern man may best approach the question of the existence of God by first inquiring how it feels to "experience God"-what types of experience tend to become conscious of themselves as experience of the divine- and what concept of God tends to arise spontaneously out of such experiences. The concept, thus formulated, may then be summoned to the bar of science and philosophy to defend itself. No one can feel his neighbor's feelings, or precisely think his neighbor's thoughts after him; so I had best draw my illustrations from my own experience. One of the most impressive religious experiences I have ever had came to me about three years ago-shades of my Puritan ancestors, avert your faces!--in the Cort Theater, where John Drinkwater's "Abraham Lincoln" was then playing. As scene succeeded scene, and the soul of Lincoln was more and more completely revealed-triumphing over his own misgivings, forsaking ease for the sake of the well-being of all, unflinching in his opposition to evil, but overcoming evil with compassion, giving his life at length as a ransom for many -I found myself at last looking upon the stage with the eyes of a worshiper, and I said to myself: "This, this is God." 598</page><page sequence="2">REASONS FOR BELIEVING IN GOD 599 Nor was I a solitary worshiper. Consciously or unconsciously, each person there worshiped God that evening. I felt it in the applause, and in the still more significant silences; and the fellowship of adoration added greatly to the depth of it for all of us; for it helped us to feel that this was not merely my God but our God-yes, the God of all mankind. Now what do I mean by saying I met God in Drinkwater's "Lincoln"? Well, what did I mean at the time? Let me scrutinize the workings of my mind. I think that Lincoln's divineness in my eyes consisted precisely in that "combination of ideality and final efficacity" which was the criterion of the divine for William James. I got a double impression of moral nobility in the highest degree, and of irresistible power. In the first place, Lincoln humbled me as the ideal always humbles the actual; his human figure, with its homely qualities and obvious limitations, became, as it were, translucent, and through it shone a pure and unwavering light, the light of the ideal, making me long unutterably to be like him-and unlike myself. But this was not all; he was for me the incarnation of irresistible might. This was, if possible, the stronger of the two impressions. "This is the spirit that is bound to win," I said to myself. I saw it triumphing before my eyes-winning the respect of the supercilious Seward and the cantankerous Stanton, turning a condemned youth into a hero and bidding fair to bind a nation into a unity based on justice and mutual forgiveness. I saw it hushing a miscellaneous New York audience into reverence. And then, the theater could not contain it. I looked out beyond the stage into the tangled world, and I saw that spirit, embodied in the messages of President Wilson, putting an end to a great war, and arousing fabulous hopes in the hearts of all the peoples-and chaos and despair rushing back upon the scene when that spirit which had governed us in war failed to get incorporated in the treaty of peace. I thought of the triumphs of many folks, ordinary and extraordinary, missionaries, reformers, plain people, in</page><page sequence="3">6oo THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION whom this spirit finds more or less imperfect embodiment, and I said to myself: "It's irresistible; it's almighty. No one can stop it. Nail it to a cross and it smiles at you and con- tinues. Sooner or later, it is going to capture the last redoubt, and rule in the hearts of all." If my enthusiasm had permitted me to stop at this point, I should simply have been affirming, as you see, that the God whom I glimpsed in Lincoln was a tendency in human history, a growing social entity, if you will, of such a nature that it was bound to overcome all obstacles and become the organizing principle of human society and the object of each human individual's allegiance. Poetizing a bit, I should easily have arrived at the conception of an Invisible King or Captain of mankind, growing with the growth of mankind, yet always leading on. That such tendencies or social entities really exist and that they deserve our worship, I gladly admit. The religious traditions of the Australian clan as symbolized in the totem animal and the churinga, the Athenian rbXs, appealed to by Pericles in his "Funeral Oration," the " Soul of America" as Stanton Coit conceives of it, and the church, the body of Christ, the mediator of divine grace to the needy individual- all these I regard as real entities worshipful in various degrees, which would, to be sure, vanish if their component members were annihilated, but which are still something more than aggregates of individuals. But I did not stop at this point, just on the margin of metaphysics, where all good positivists draw the line. I pressed on-rashly, perhaps-and it began to rain meta- physics, thick and fast. "The spirit of Lincoln," I said in my haste, "must triumph. The nature of things is such- human nature, of course, but nature in general too. The universe is built that way; that's why the universe is on his side." "Yes"-and here I took a terrific leap, from an impersonal moral order to an anthropomorphic deity-"there is at the heart of things a spirit like that of Lincoln, a personality</page><page sequence="4">REASONS FOR BELIEVING IN GOD 6oi like his." Thus did the primitive savage reason, and thus, I admit it, I reasoned. The religious experience is many-sided, and I do not rest my conception of God upon any one experience or any one type of experience, of course. I rest it in part, inevitably, upon the experiences of my Christian predecessors, as crystallized in the words and notions I was taught in childhood-words and notions that inevitably shape my own experience. To com- plete the picture of what God means to me, I must touch upon a few other types of experience of the divine with which I am familiar, not to be classified with the experience of the divine in a historic personality. There is, first, the experience of the Holy Spirit, which has sometimes come upon me when worshiping in company with a number of like-minded individuals. This experience was really present as an overtone in the experience I have described, for I was distinctly conscious of intimate fellowship with the rest of the audience in the theater. Then, there is the experience of ethical insight. Once, while crossing the path in front of Memorial Hall, Harvard, on my way to lunch, I met a negro workman, whose eyes met mine, quite accidentally, as we passed. In that instant I felt certain that the veil of flesh had dropped away from both of us, that I had seen into his soul, and he into mine. We smiled simultaneously, a smile of perfect mutual compre- hension; then passed on without slackening our pace, for there was nothing to say; but I, at least, had been momentarily transported into a world of spiritual realities where the childish- ness of race prejudice was transparently evident. "This is the way things look to God," I said to myself; "how can he ever bear with our blindness!" Then, finally, there is the more definitely mystical type of experience, in which no human values seem to be prominent, and the individual self finds itself merged in a sort of cosmic consciousness. For me, the sight of an extensive and har-</page><page sequence="5">602 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION monious landscape, preferably mountainous and far from the city, or the sight of the starry sky on a clear night most natu- rally leads to such experiences. Once, I remember, while lying on my back on a settee by the shore of a pond, listening to the swash of the waves and watching some birds flying far overhead, I fell to thinking about the vastness of the universe and my own littleness and transitoriness.' Eventu- ally I seemed to feel myself caught up out of myself into a larger consciousness, and found myself smiling down upon my poor little empirical self, far down below there upon the settee; and as the sensation passed, I said to myself: "How paltry are most of the things with which I occupy myself. How much more there is that matters, besides what matters to me!" And again I said: "This is how things look to God." I may define the conception of God which seems to emerge spontaneously from such experiences as these by comparing it with the conception of God which Professor Royce defended in his earliest writings. It would agree emphatically with Professor Royce that God must be conscious; if not omniscient, at least far more widely conscious than we are; for the conclu- sion we jump to in our moments of elevation is that there is some mind which always sees things as we see them at these moments. On the other hand, the religious consciousness seems to object strenuously to Royce's conception of a God lifted above time, taking no part in history except to survey it at a glance. The God of religion belongs in that World of the Powers in which Royce could find no God; he is a Power among powers, the Power that is progressively victorious, not by compulsion, but through the gradual impartation of his purpose and outlook to the leaders of mankind. But now comes the moment to abandon the mood of enthusiasm, and begin to examine critically these metaphysical conclusions which the religious consciousness so boldly and I This always tends to give what Otto calls the Kreaturgefiihl, and Schleiermacher calls the "feeling of absolute dependence."</page><page sequence="6">REASONS FOR BELIEVING IN GOD 603 naively draws from its own experience. The question at once arises: Is not this whole process of springing nimbly from my own worshipful feelings to the conception of a superhuman spirit worthy of worship, simply a case of what Santayana calls the "pathetic" fallacy, the fallacy of empathy or Einfiihlung, whereby man naively assumes that the object on which his attention is concentrated at moments of extreme emotion is itself a personal being, filled with an emotion which is the obverse of his own, whereby also he concludes in general that whatever matters to him and his tribe matters to the universe ? The history of religion certainly gives us ample cause to mis- trust this primitive and naive tendency. This it was which produced that multitude of gods and spirits with which the woods and streams and air were filled in the ancient world. Today we should most of us admit that when poets personify a river or a tree it is poetry and nothing more; and when Fechner speaks of an Earth-Soul, it is very bad metaphysics. We may be opposed to absolute materialism in philosophy, and conceive of atoms and molecules as in some sense psychic; but we should never try to carry on a conversation with them and expect them to have anything very significant to say to us. I admit, therefore, that the god-idea sprang originally-at least in part-from a very dangerous fallacy, which still threatens to entangle all who do not guard themselves against it. Now if, as many allege, the religious consciousness, after once forming its hasty conclusions, is thenceforth "impervious to experience," then the same condemnation which falls upon primitive animism falls upon modern theism; it is at best a "rationalization" of an essentially illogical position, reached through loose emotional reasoning. I do not think, however, that the history of religion justifies such a generalization. The god-idea has obviously gone through tremendous trans- formations since primitive times, and those transformations are the result not only of rationalization but of a sort of empiri- cal process of trial-and-error, which has repeatedly brought</page><page sequence="7">604 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION the god-idea to the test of the facts, and so provided for its correction. The Hebrew prophets, for example, repeatedly used their idea of Yahweh as a means of historical prediction, quite as scientists use hypotheses as a basis for prediction. "Supposing Einstein's theory to be true, then you will observe certain curious phenomena at the next solar eclipse." "Sup- posing Yahweh to be a God of justice, then the Israelites will eventually perish as a nation if they persist in social injustice; supposing he rules all nations, then the Assyrians, too, will fall, if they persistently oppress other nations." When the prophets' predictions failed, as they frequently did, they were not always content to rationalize and explain the unaccountable exception by hook or crook, under the old hypothesis. They frequently modified their idea of God. When, for example, the undeserved sufferings of Israel created a problem for those who believed in a God who always requited measure for measure, many, to be sure, concluded that Israel must have sinned; others, with more insight, decided that God does not requite measure for measure, but permits the wicked to pros- per and the good to suffer. Hard facts have had their share in the creation of the modern idea of God; and to cast such an idea aside would be to throw away a perfect treasure house of hard-won truth. The question remains, however, whether the truth of the idea of God is not a purely practical sort of truth, expressing the way the cosmos affects our interests, and not what the cosmos is in itself. Is not Santayana right in saying that the mythologies and theologies which man has constructed reveal the truth, not about the universe, but about man's moral nature ? I think he is so nearly right that I am not going to take the trouble to argue the matter. I think it is perfectly evident that religious discovery is mainly discovery of moral values, and that the religious consciousness deceives itself when it thinks to learn truths about the astronomical constitu- tion of the universe, by mystic revelation, as Swedenborg did.</page><page sequence="8">REASONS FOR BELIEVING IN GOD 605 The Hebrew prophets often mixed up meteorology and morals, even in their truest intuitions. The intuition that the Assy- rians could not triumph was a good one; yet it is probable that it was expected that Yahweh would send down lightning from heaven upon them at the critical moment, whereas the real rock on which Assyrian militarism and all militarism splits is human nature. Yes, I grant it: Theological truth is primarily practical and relates in the first instance to the sphere of human values; as a representation of cosmic reality it is more or less symbolic, and much of it needs to be regarded as poetry rather than as literal truth. But does this mean that theology is wholly irrelevant to metaphysics, and that the movement of thought from the human to the cosmic is wholly illegitimate ? Is the "moral order" which the prophet discovers a purely human and social entity, and does it reveal nothing about the nature of the universe? To make any such assertion seems to me very rash; it is to create a wholly unreal and artificial chasm between man and nature. I grant that man's self-importance needs to be disciplined; he needs to be told over and over again that he is not the center of the universe, and that if things are "made for" anyone they certainly are not made for him, or him alone; he needs to be told that things as they appear to him and as they affect him are not things in them- selves; but for all that, I do not see how any sane person can persuade himself that human history and human aspirations and human ethical insight reveal nothing about the nature of the cosmos. I want to suggest two considerations that seem to me to establish the legitimacy of a certain type of inference from human to cosmic reality, and justify in a measure that swift leap by which the religious consciousness rises to the conception of the cosmic Personality. The first is this: If we adopt Professor Leuba's distinction between "mechanical" and "anthropopathic" behavior, there</page><page sequence="9">606 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION is no reason, a priori, why the success of mechanistic science should make us conclude that mechanical behavior alone is appropriate in dealing with the cosmos. It may be said that, when man and the higher animals are subtracted from the universe, all that remains is precisely that sphere of law and impersonal force where anthropopathic conduct is futile. Now it is obvious that mechanistic science has had magnificent success in dealing with this "residual cosmos "-success which makes one look askance at the religious conduct which until very recent times held sway in the same field. We do not dispute that lightning rods are better protection in a thunder- storm than sacrifice and prayer, and medical treatment is ordinarily better than exorcism in organic diseases. Still, if we use our daily experience as a guide, there is nothing more certain than this: that the same thing may often be dealt with either mechanically or anthropopathically, and that in such cases it is anthropopathic behavior which gets us in touch with the deeper and the more inclusive reality. I am unfortunately forced every day to deal with multitudes of my fellow-men mechanically, as mere objects in my environment, responding in certain definite and predictable ways when properly approached. The street-car conductor is to me hardly more personal than the prepayment machine he manipu- lates. Yet that same conductor, if I take the pains to scrape an acquaintance with him, responds to me in a very different and far more significant way. I see no reason, a priori, for denying the possibility of tapping new depths of reality in the residual cosmos by means of anthropopathic behavior. Daily experience, on the contrary, would encourage me to make the experiment. In the environment which immediately surrounds me, I find certain objects which respond only to mechanical behavior; others which respond both to mechanical and to anthropopathic behavior. Why may not the residual cosmos, too, contain objects of both types ? This first consideration is merely preparatory, and is addressed only to those in whose minds there is an inhibition</page><page sequence="10">REASONS FOR BELIEVING IN GOD 607 against even entertaining the hypothesis of a cosmic mind. Such people are not rare. They need to be made aware of the fact that they are unconscious dogmatists, resting upon a priori convictions with almost mystic tenacity. Leaning over back- ward to escape the fallacy of "reading in," they have fallen into the fallacy of "reading out." The second consideration is this: All development takes place under the influence of external stimuli; the nature of the development-particularly in its later stages-reveals the nature of the stimuli; consequently, the nature of human development reveals the nature of the cosmic stimuli which called it forth. The validity of the general principle I am laying down will be perfectly evident if we confine our attention at the start to ontogenetic development.' The human individual, from the moment when the egg is first fertilized by the sperm to the moment when, having made his own all that his social environ- ment has to offer, he stands face to face with cosmic reality and dares to dream dreams of a better society than earth yet can offer, is constantly under the influence of external stimuli, which beat upon him incessantly from his immediate material environment, from his social environment, and from his cosmic environment. His growth is conditioned by his response. At first he reacts only to the grosser sensory stimuli, and his growth is mainly physical growth. Next he begins to react to stimuli which beat upon him from his immediate social environment, the family; next, to the widening worlds which open up to him as he explores the neighborhood, goes to school, and comes in contact with various social groups; finally, if the study of science or philosophy, or the presentation of religious ideas, makes a strong-enough appeal to him, he may come to live in a world coextensive with the known universe, and the cosmos itself, as he conceives it, may come to play such a r6le in his life that he feels himself able to look down ' Let the reader reflect upon Professor Cooley's description of the development of the self in Humati Nature and the Social Order.</page><page sequence="11">608 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION upon current ideas and ideals from a certain height, and so becomes a scientific or ethical or religious reformer. Reacting to these new stimuli, the individual grows-and this now means not merely physical, but mental, moral, and religious growth. All this illustrates what Professor Holt calls the "recession of the stimulus": the reaction of the organism to more and more distant and more and more spiritual stimuli. What really changes, however, is not the stimulus but the response; the stimulus was there all the time, but the organism was not yet capable of responding to it. Hence I say that the later, wider, subtler responses of the organism reveal more of the nature of the stimulus than the earlier, grosser responses. A codfish reveals more of the stimuli which play upon a given region of the ocean than does an oyster; he has responded to more of them. An eight-year-old child reveals the kind of family in which he has been brought up more exactly than a two- year-old baby; and if you are trying to read the father's character from the son's, you will do well to pay attention to his half-inarticulate aspirations, for they are often more significant than his settled habits, which represent earlier and grosser reactions. The significance of external stimuli in ontogenetic develop- ment, and the significance of the response-particularly at later stages-as a clue to the nature of the stimulus, is perfectly evident to all of us, because we can stand outside the process oJ development and survey stimulus and response at a single glance. It would not be so apparent to us, if we were condemned to stand inside the process, and the exciting stimulus were invisible to us. Such would be the plight of a consistent solipsist, who refused to admit the objectivity of his sense impressions, and the external source of the ideas he got from other people. He would be conscious of a certain persistent widening of his horizon, and a constant enrichment of his store of meanings and ideals, but he would attribute it to his own vital urge, and if scientifically minded could easily connect each new</page><page sequence="12">REASONS FOR BELIEVING IN GOD 609 sense impression and each new idea in a causal sequence with all that had preceded it, thus conclusively exploding the notion of an objective world, and proving that he alone was the cause of all that went on in his mind. If, however, his imagi- nary Alter should succeed in convincing him, by some tour de force, that an external world existed, our solipsist might still maintain that this external world was a realm of impersonal force and immutable law, so that it would be absurd to behave anthropopathically toward it, as one behaved toward the Alter. Meanings and ideals, commonly associated with personal selves, certainly appeared to spring up in the Ego as a result of contact with the external world; but might not such personal ideas spring up in the Ego as the result of contact with impersonal forces? Miglt they not be simply the way the external world affected the Ego, and would not the Ego be committing the "pathetic" fallacy, and reading in its own emotions, if it rashly entertained the hypothesis of the existence of personalities external to its own ? To this argument it would be difficult to reply, unless the Ego were willing to admit the principle that personal ideas can only be awakened by contact with personalities; and he would probably object that this principle opened the way for the wildest mythologiz- ing. Yet we ordinary common-sense mortals, looking on from the outside, should know all the time that the most significant part of our solipsist's development was due to contact with other minds, and his mental and moral development would seem to us to be a perfect clue to the precise nature of the social environment in which he had been brought up. Now when we turn to the development of the human race, we are all of us precisely in the solipsist's predicament; we cannot survey at a glance the development of the race and the cosmic stimuli which called forth that development, because the cosmos is too vast and we know too little about it, and because we see it through the spectacles of the human under- standing-through those "collective representations" which,</page><page sequence="13">61o THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION as the French sociologists remind us, have come down to us from primitive times. And our bias' is the solipsist's bias: We are tempted to assume that human evolution, beginning with the evolution of life out of inorganic matter, and culminat- ing in acts and aspirations like Lincoln's, which we instinctively call "divine," is a self-explanatory process, inwardly moti- vated, bursting up spontaneously like the elan vital. Any such view, with all due respect to most of the philosophy we have had since the epoch of Romanticism, is essentially absurd. It is like explaining the sprouting of grass in the springtime without taking the sun and the rain into consideration; it is like describing the development of personality in a child without taking his parents and playmates into the picture. Human history, taken by itself, is like one end of a telephone conversation; it irresistibly suggests the existence of an external stimulus to which it is the response. As to the nature of those stimuli which have evoked the evolution of man, again I suggest that the later stages in the evolutionary process are the most significant. Just as physical stimuli may seem sufficient to explain the first stages in the growth of a baby, so an almost mechanical theory of evolution may seem sufficient to account for the appearance of life upon the earth and the origin of species; but as we mount the path of human history, it becomes increasingly difficult to account for the strange new meanings and values and ideals and aspirations that meet us there, except on the hypothesis that they came into human history through contact with some external mind. This is the hypothesis which we know to be true, so far as the new meanings and ideals which enter the individ- ual mind are concerned; and we should quite lose patience with a solipsist who disputed it. Why should we turn about and become solipsists when we transfer our attention from the ,I think that this bias, to which the modern man is peculiarly liable, is just as dangerous as the animistic bias to which primitive man was subject-which may serve to explain my previous remark that in leaning over backward to escape the fallacy of "reading in," one falls into the fallacy of "reading out."</page><page sequence="14">REASONS FOR BELIEVING IN GOD 611 relations between the individual and society to the relations between society and the cosmos ? Why not adopt the hypoth- esis which is the most natural of all hypotheses: that man is growing up under the tutelage of a Person or Persons greatly superior to him in wisdom and in goodness-so much superior to him that it is not in the light of man's actual career and actual characteristics, but rather in the light of his intuitive presenti- ments and inchoate longings that the depth and richness of that superior type of personality can best be conceived. Even certain individuals of transcendent genius seem to require some such hypothesis to explain them, for they have outgrown all that society had to teach them, and look up and out to something above and beyond society; much more is this the case if we think of the evolution of mankind as a whole. This is the hypothesis which saints and prophets in all ages have set forth, not as a hypothesis, but as an immediate certainty; my argument is that the quality of the ideas with which such people have enriched humanity makes their naive hypothesis the most probable one. It is only fair to point out that to admit validity of the argument here presented for the existence of personality in the extra-human cosmos would not be to commit one's self to the traditional type of theism, to belief in an Almighty Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Development takes places chiefly under the stimulus of the immediate environment; the nature of the development reveals the nature of the immedi- ate environment more clearly than it reveals that of the more remote environment. The child's development reveals the character of his parents better than it reveals the character of his casual acquaintances. Hence all my argument tends to prove is that over the little stream of cosmic history in which you and I are tiny eddies, there broods the influence of Personality greater than man's. Whether the scope and sway of that Personality are universal and uncontested or limited and provincial, whether we should think of it as a single,</page><page sequence="15">612 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION well-organized Central Mind or as a sort of Spiritual Common- wealth like Felix Adler's'-these are questions to which my argument does not permit me to return a categorical answer. The question of monotheism versus polytheism, it seems to me, is still very much of an open question. "Man is not a monotheistic animal"; at any rate, he never immediately experiences the divine unity. The divine Personality comes to him most intimately and persuasively through the medium of human personalities, through Christ's personality to a most extraordinary degree, through other personalities in various degrees, through one's own personality at certain exalted moments. If the divine be one at its source in the external cosmos, it nevertheless must filter down to us by devious paths, first through the social atmosphere in which we all live and move and have our being, and then through the fog of individual experience in which each one of us is enshrouded; and in so doing it is refracted into all the colors of the rainbow, and takes on a thousand bizarre and subjective forms. How can we tell at what level the plurality of the divine-as-we-experience-it gives place to the unity of the divine- as-it-is-in-itself? By what right shall we brush aside the Catholic angelologies and gnostic theogonies which carry the principle of divine plurality out into the cosmic realm ? The religious consciousness itself is in a strait betwixt two in this matter; it does not know whether it wants to believe in one God or in many-witness the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, which carries the principle of diversity into the very heart of the divine nature, while at the same time affirming the divine unity in the most emphatic terms. At just one point, however, the verdict of the history of religions in favor of the monotheism is clear and specific; A plurality of warring gods, differing in character and function, is no more tolerable in the long run than a plurality of moral standards. However diverse may be the forms in which the I Only within time instead of above time, and more objectively conceived.</page><page sequence="16">REASONS FOR BELIEVING IN GOD 613 divine is made manifest, the quality of the divine must always be the same. We demand the same consistency, orderliness, and unity in the realm of the divine which we have come to discern in the physical universe and which we hope to create in human society. The great affirmation of Hebrew and Christian monotheism is that the moral law which rules the destiny of men and nations is as international, impartial, and invariable as the laws of Nature; and that in the working of the moral law there is to be discerned a divine Purpose- single, unswerving, indefatigable-whose goal is the creation of a world-wide commonwealth of justice, peace, and good will among men. Singleness of character and quality, single- ness of purpose, this is the kind of divine unity that it is practically important to affirm; and this kind of unity might be predicated either of a single divine personality or of a com- munity of divine personalities. So far as I can see, it is a matter of indifference to the religious consciousness-unity of purpose once being granted-whether the God-head be single, triple, or multiple. Personally, I prefer to think of a single divine Personality, whose influence comes to us in manifold forms, most impressively through the medium of human personalities and social groups; but I do not think the evidence for such a conception is decisive, and I do not see why specula- tion in this field should not be left absolutely free and flexible. If the question of the numerical structure of the divine Personality is largely an academic question, irrelevant to the religious problem, the same cannot be said of the question of the scope of the divine influence in the cosmos-or, to put the question in its familiar form, the relation of God to Nature. Whether God's influence is confined to our corner of the uni- verse, whether behind him there stands a Veiled Being, ready to overrule his holiest purposes as 'AvayKJ overruled the will of the Olympian gods, or whether, on the other hand, Nature is malleable to his will and full of the evidence of his work- ing, are questions of the utmost practical concern. To be</page><page sequence="17">614 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION forced to admit the former alternative, after arriving at a belief in the existence of a personal God, would be almost equivalent to losing God after finding him. It is just at this point that the teleological argument for the existence of God becomes significant. By itself, the evidence of the existence of "development and purpose" and trends toward harmony in the physical and biological realms is not sufficient to prove the existence of a Personal God such as the religious consciousness demands. The best that Nature, animate and inanimate, reveals, is a series of incipient tenden- cies toward organization and harmony, which, could they once get fairly under way, might prove to be as significant as the tendency which issued in human evolution. Only a tendency come to fruition, or such partial fruition as we find in human evolution, can reveal such a God as we have been describing, or justify us in assuming his existence; and, perhaps on account of our astronomical situation, we are as yet acquainted with no other similarly advanced tendency. But this does not rob the teleological argument of its value. The initial stages of the process of evolution which eventuated in man were identical with the stages which the whole observable cosmos appears to be going through. Once grant that the existence of a Personal Stimulus must be assumed in order to account for human evolution, and the universal presence of rudimentary purposive trends in the cosmos will then appear to be a most cogent argument for the universal scope of the operation of that same Stimulus. What, then, is the relation of God to Nature? Well, Nature is, in a sense, an abstraction, a blanket term covering everything that can be handled by mechanical conduct and mechanical concepts; that is, everything, including ourselves. If, however, the term "Nature" be restricted to mean all that does not respond to anthropopathic behavior, I think the evidence marshaled by Hobhouse in his Development and Purpose appears to justify the belief that Nature is increasingly coming</page><page sequence="18">REASONS FOR BELIEVING IN GOD 615 under the divine control. Those aspects of Nature which are clearly purposive may be regarded as the furniture of the cosmic schoolroom, the medium through which God stings and stimulates the dormant personalities of his creatures. Those aspects of Nature which are clearly chaotic and resist all efforts at teleological interpretation may be regarded as the cosmic parallel to such human phenomena as unfinished work and unrequited love. As for the underlying laws and conditions of the cosmic process, they are at any rate such that harmony, life, and perhaps eventually personality spring up as naturally in every quarter of the universe as vegetation springs up in a plowed field, and over the whole creation the divine control visibly--if slowly and haltingly-advances. To affirm this is to affirm the essential part of the conviction which has traditionally expressed itself in the doctrine that God created and sustains the universe. I hope it is clear that I do not identify God with any tendency toward harmony in Nature (as Hobhouse sometimes seems to) any more than I identify him with any tendency toward righteousness in human history. These are signs of the working of God, the response that proves the stimulus; I do not worship them, but I worship the stimulus that called them forth. Thus God, as I conceive him, transcends Nature. For the general conditions of life, which seem to be under his control, I give him thanks as devoutly as my Puritan ancestors; but I recognize that there is much to be changed in Nature, by him as by us.</page></plain_text>
