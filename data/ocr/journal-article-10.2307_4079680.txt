<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bird behavior.-Although the present work has as its major title, "Bird Dis- play," the breadth of the subject is better expressed by the secondary title, "An Introduction to the Study of Bird Psychology," as a glance at the chapter headings will show. 'The Evolution of Nest Building,' 'Courtship Feeding,' 'Disablement Reactions,' 'The Expression of the Emotions,' 'The Evolution of Social Ceremonies,' 'The Social Hierarchy in Bird Life,' and 'Territory, Song, and Song-flight' are but some of the subjects there listed and there are still others discussed though not mentioned by title. Such a large share of a bird's activities are a part of its emo- tional life that many actions that might appear to be unrelated are, in reality, part of the same psychological picture. Great strides have been made in com- paratively recent years in getting an insight into the nature of the world in which a bird lives, and a very different world it is from what was supposed even a generation ago. So much has been done by workers in different places and their findings have been published in so many diverse journals and books, that it is undoubtedly difficult for many students to follow all of the current developments. Mr. Arm- strong has made a useful contribution by collecting these scattered accounts and extracting the pertinent facts for comparison with each other. Thirty-one pages of bibliographic references attest to the amount of material that has gone into the present account. The text is not, however, a compilation of quotations. It is a readable discussion of the vast complex of reactions to internal and external stimuli that make up so much of the bird's behavior pattern, noting the conflicting observational data and the theories that have been adduced therefrom with Mr. Armstrong's own inter- pretations added. Anthropomorphism has lost its early standing and finds no place here. The book thus serves not only as a mine of digested information but 2Armstrong, E. A.

Vernacular names have been used for the birds in the general text but the scientific names are tabulated in systematic order in a special list. The bibliography has already been mentioned. There is a three-part index-one part for the animals discussed, one for the subject matter, and one for the authors whose observations have been used. The pages of the general text are free from lengthy documenta- tion. Twenty-two plates contain forty well-chosen photographs from various sources illustrating different types of avian behavior.-J. T.
