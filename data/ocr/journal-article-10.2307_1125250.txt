<plain_text><page sequence="1">X-ings KEN DEWEY It should be easy to get off a few words about one's work-exchange use- ful debris and so forth. It isn't. It's hard to know where to start, but even more one senses so-called Theatre at the edge of provoking an explosive degree of consciousness. I mean, once you get away from what Paul Sills has aptly called the GOD'S WORD way of doing things- Creative Artist Playwright Creative Coordinator Director Supportive Artists Design: Set, Costumes, Lights, Music Support Coordinators Stage Manager &amp; Technicians Interpretive Artists Performers Interpretation Coordinators Audience -once a form begins through participation or outright collaboration to deliberately engage the individual imaginations of audience and performer alike, across the board as it were, then you're into a fairly serious realm. What form? What realm? Let me start with a reference point. With all the cover terms around (Happenings, Events, Pieces, etc.) it's hard to use any of them and know what one is talking about. This is further complicated because Happenings themselves often include the everyday, so, to many, anything is a Happen- ing. And because new terms are meant to indicate new forms we seem to have a variation on Jimmy Durante's old horror of moving to Hackensack to forget Hoboken and then going to Weehawken to forget Hackensack, and so on... "It should have been made clear that Happenings came about when painters and sculptors crossed into theatre taking with them their way of looking and doing things." Taking with them, that is, their aesthetics. Claes Oldenburg said that this summer and it's worth passing on as sort of a key. Someone with an aesthetic sought techniques outside his field in order to articulate experiences. The results were hybrids, with characteris- 216</page><page sequence="2">tics of their own, the products of some kind of fusion. This is a pretty good reference point. In one direction you've got the how, a kind of working definition based on process. In the other direction, a broad spectrum of similarly based activities has opened up.

If one wanted to get academic about it and still ask a valid question, one could identify new forms, indicate sources (as above) and then inquire what the other elements of fusion were. The following is a series of crossings one knows are taking place and which have either been identified within a larger form or have not been considered independent activities.

Ad-Men&lt; &gt;Happenings In seeking roots one can go back to Bauhaus or the Dadaists, to numer- ous individual artists like Dali, Duchamp, Schwitters, and even to all the obscure projects undertaken over the years in the name of Art by those absorbed with vengeance, simple curiosity, or complex boredom. Ob- viously, the causes of Happenings have been "in the air" for at least fifty years, probably longer. All the casual, instinctive, and scattershot con- tacts-which play a large part in that continuity of experimentation which comprises a form's "birth"-had to wait for development of the awareness that here was something of independent interest. Someone had to make it stick as a separate form. That, of course, is exactly what Allan Kaprow did for Happenings. What we have now are "forms" coming almost at the rate of synthetic chemicals. Personally, I think that's great. We need new methods and new techniques of articulation: ways in which people can express themselves. But there's a problem. Dada's big failing was that when it broke through the hierarchy of objects it didn't go all the way and change the relationship of the artist to the viewer. And artists are still greedily homesteading on 218</page><page sequence="4">KEN DEWEY HELGE HEINONEN STREET PIECE HELSINKI, August 1963. Shown is one of eighteen events which were scored to take place during one hour in the center of Helsinki. Bass player arrived in marketplace by tram. Waited. Ballerina Airi Hynninen came by cab.

They left as they had come. techniques that should have simply been put into the public domain as useful processes. This problem is likely to be resolved when people (as a whole) get themselves to stop worshipping and to start doing. Vogues are a good example of how curbs get set on the realms of individ- ual imagination. Perhaps they are urban worship. For instance when hippies got onto the techniques for a little harmless jacking off at "ing" parties, and toilet paper rolls, sign, and bras got rejuvenated as "hap- peners" gear on the college circuit, the lazy of the world's editors who'd been confused on how to bag Happenings finally got them nailed down as that. Happenings and relatd related crossings have had the potential of being neutral terrains where anyone could come, check his luggage, and make it. At his own best depth. When the mass media set shallow response as the standard they slowed things down, for a short while. Concerning realm, my own lot's been to work from pretty much the 219</page><page sequence="5">Tulane Drama Review same assumptions about emotional scale and physical scale that Artaud projected. The crossings have been into music, reporting, and sports. With the exception of one piece in New York last spring the work has been in other countries (nine of them) during the better part of 1963-1964. Before that I worked on the West Coast, mostly in San Francisco. In 1961, when the prevailing cross-over was into theatre (having been there myself, for seven years, as student, technician, and playwright), I was trying to get out. I mean that literally: out of the text, out of the building, and, most ear- nestly, out of theatre's way of doing things. Looking back, the actions seem methodical; but at the time they were anything but. It's interesting how VAXLINGAR, November, 1964, Stockholm. Part 1: the silent waiting room. closely they parallel what Kaprow has described as his progression: out of the frame, off the wall, into the room, into other spaces-gradually adding objects and people. The frames for theatre are text, building, and rehearsal. My early efforts were to decrease dependency on all three. I had written, by then, two full- length plays and ten short ones. Some of the short plays had been produced. Texts were so important to me that I couldn't bear to fuss with my own. 220</page><page sequence="6">KEN DEWEY Instead I took Camus' The Misunderstanding and, for a lab project at the Actor's Workshop, replaced the play's set and all but one character with the music of Edgard Varese ("Poem Electronique," "Hyperprism," and one other). Yvette Nachmias-an actress with mime and dance training- played the character who was left. Alternately she talked to the music, allowed it to reflect her thoughts, and treated it as part of the environment. That was 1961. By then, Happenings had already been going on in New York for some time. If it was cowardly to choose Camus, the next time I paid full dues when we turned one of my own texts over to the process. Two dancers from Ann Halprin's company-Lynne Palmer and John Graham-treated a short play, The Gift, kinesthetically. As director I went along, forcing weak smiles of approval as the text became progressively less intelligible. We worked for two months and the play kept coming in and out of focus like James Lord reports Giacometti's paintings do. I never knew how it would end and I squashed recurrent urges to get protective. At a certain point re- hearsals ended. The words had come back but by now the thing was some- thing so complex that one couldn't have notated it. It conformed to what Braque said a finished painting was: when nothing remains of the original idea. The Gift's greatest achievement was to get us into the streets; because the performers carried everything they used on their backs, we could set up anywhere, indoors or out. And we were taken by the idea of being out and around. A fixed text is unwieldy in a street but the accidental audience was fantastic and I dreamt up scroungy little manifestoes calling for a break with theatre buildings. At about the same time, at end of 1961, I saw Bob Whitman's American Moon in New York. Later, when Whitman came west, I was in one of his Happenings. I was very impressed. At the same time we were working with John Cage's Theatre Piece at Ann Halprin's workshop. Through these exposures I encountered the possibility of com- posing with events. However, it wasn't until early 1963, when the Tape Music Center produced City Scale, that I got a chance to actually try the style. This audience-journey piece (see this issue of TDR, p. 186a) was worked out with the composer Ramon Sender and the painter Anthony Martin. It was also my first try at collaborative scoring. Of the three frames, essentially text was freed at Edinburgh two years back. It's necessary to say "nude" Happening I suppose since that's what 221</page><page sequence="7">Tulane Drama Review all the newspapers talked about. Anyway, having been asked to show the Drama Conference a Happenings demonstration, three of us (Charles Lewsen, an English playwright, Mark Boyle, an English assemblagist, and myself) studied the Conference itself through four days. On the fifth day an eight-minute piece comprised of some fifteen events dealing with Con- ference themes was introduced back into the Conference. This reportage- type Happening is an alternative to writing a play or essay about the whole thing later. Space was freed by composing with it. Enclosures like the Modern Museum in Stockholm became the source. All ideas were generated by working with the spaces and considering the city of which they are part. On various projects with which he was involved, sculptor Jerry Walter drew attention to plastic qualities. More recently an architect, Robert Mitchell, drew attention to static aspects by doing an anthropomorphic study of a performance enclosure. He asked in effect what the building itself wanted. In an era which can produce a major concert hall with poor acoustics and a stadium in which players can't see the ball this isn't an idle question. Where text obviously controlled time, and stage defined space, the real surprise was to notice that the rehearsal process-the terms on which people met-automatically set motion and emotion within limits even be- fore anybody did anything. The Misunderstanding, The Gift, and City Scale clarified issues. Successive projects focused on elements much as painters focused on just color, or just texture, etc. Projects with the Swedish composers tended 'to solve problems of form. At the Pistol Theatre in Stockholm and particularly in Helsinki at the Finnish Student Theatre, Lilla Teatern, and with Henrik Otto Donner, new ways of dealing with content or realm came about. The further out one moves, the simpler becomes one's understanding of what theatre is. I now would accept only that theatre is a situation in which people gather to articulate something of mutual concern. This is why my work has moved toward an exploration of the problems related to group articulation while, on the other hand, those artists who've come into theatre from fields of individual expression are concerned with communicating an individual image. There isn't time here to discuss the problems of replacing controls with rapport as the binding agent within such a performance. However, a piece is at its best when two agons are working at once: the 222</page><page sequence="8">first between people and themselves and the second between the whole group and something beyond itself. And when a group allows the content of its working together to generate its own form (and I include the audience as part of the group), it's like-the difference between dynamite and, you know, the next one. And that to my mind is the potential motion of these crossings. JOSE ARUEGO WITHOUT AND WITHIN: tug-of-war pole dance. June, 1965, Palm Gardens Ballroom, New York City.
