<plain_text> <page sequence="1">      6 Temporal distribution: quantitative changes in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment Radiocarbon ages were obtained for 15 of the 35 archaeological deposits in the random sampling units (Table 6.1). Eleven of these ages were reported in Attenbrow 1987 (Table 7.1) and an additional four were obtained in 1995. All dated samples were charcoal. The depth from which each sample came is shown in the tables in Appendix 2. Radiocarbon ages for SUA-1124, SUA-1125 and SUA-1206 from Loggers Shelter were revised after completion of the salvage excavation report and the ages given for these samples in Table 6.1 differ from those in Attenbrow 1981 (p. 70). The earliest date, 11,050±135 BP (SUA-931), which comes from the base of Loggers Shelter, provides a terminal Pleistocene date for Aboriginal use of the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment. Though SUA-931 provides the earliest evidence for occupation of the catchment, earlier dates from other sites in Australia, and particularly from the NSW central and south coasts, indicate that people were inhabiting coastal south-eastern Australia well before this time (Appendix 4, Table A4/2).  For this study, the 11,000-year period of occupation in the catchment has been divided into four phases based on typological and raw material changes in the artefact assemblages (Table 3.8). In addition, to document changes at different times of the archaeological record at a finer scale, a millennial sequence was calculated for each of the archaeological deposits using depth/age curves (Appendix 2 has calculations). The stone artefact assemblages in 27 of the archaeological deposits (all in rockshelters) were assigned to a particular phase or phases on the basis of radiocarbon ages and/or diagnostic artefacts and assemblage attributes (Table 6.2, Chapter 3). Three other archaeological deposits in rockshelters without stone artefacts were assigned to a particular phase or phases using other criteria: for Bird Tracks and Two Moths, the phase in which habitation occurred was estimated on the depth of deposit (see Chapter 3); for Firestick, the state of preservation of the modified wood suggests a recent date and it was assigned to Phase 4. None of the open archaeological deposits were radiocarbon-dated; nor was it possible to assign any of them to specific phases or millennia. Delight OD, Kyola Road, Palmers Crossing North and Willow Tree Gully each had small numbers of undiagnostic artefacts in unstratified or disturbed deposits (Tables 4.5 and 4.7). At Black Hands OD, the ground fragment suggests only that this location was used at least within the last 4000 years. These five archaeological deposits are excluded from the temporal analyses, and the data set analysed in this chapter consists of 30 archaeological deposits in rockshelters. terra australis 21 115 </page> <page sequence="2">      What’s changing: population size or land-use patterns?

The first data set included 15 archaeological deposits, eight of which had radiocarbon ages and seven of which had their time of establishment estimated on the basis of artefact types and/or stone materials. The second data set had 26 archaeological deposits, which included the first data set, plus another 11 which had much smaller artefact assemblages. Assigning the time of establishment of the additional 11 sites to specific periods was thus more speculative than those in the first data set. terra australis 21 116 </page> <page sequence="3">    Temporal distribution: quantitative changes in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment Changes over time for these two storage area data sets were presented using a four- phased sequence based on typological changes in the stone artefact assemblages. On the basis of the first data set, I stated that ‘there was an increase in the number of shelters which were used over time’, but that ‘more new shelters were occupied during the latter half of the Middle Bondaian phase than in other phases’ (Attenbrow 1981: 127; see also Attenbrow 1982b: 76). Inclusion of ‘the more speculative data’ to form data set 2 suggested ‘there was a gradual increase in the number of new shelters being occupied throughout the Bondaian period although during the Late Bondaian period there was a marked increase’; that is:  ... very few shelters were occupied before 5000 years ago. About 5000 years ago the number of new shelters being occupied began to increase. Between 2750 and 1200 BP there may have been a greater number of [new] shelters occupied than during the other phases of the Bondaian period, or if the more speculative data is accepted, during the Late Bondaian phase there was a dramatic increase in the number of new shelters being occupied. (Attenbrow 1981: 127–8) For the salvage program, artefact accumulation rates were calculated only for Loggers Shelter (Attenbrow 1981: 73–4, Tables 6.4 and 6.5). In this rockshelter, there was either ‘a gradual increase in the number of artefacts discarded, then a decrease prior to a final increase’ or ‘a continuing increase in the amount of stone artefacts discarded over time, particularly in the latter phase of occupation’ (Attenbrow 1981: 129; 1982b: 77). I noted that the trend towards increasing artefact discard probably would not be seen in the most recent phase at Mussel or Deep Creek, where artefact densities in the upper units were significantly lower than in the middle units. In the salvage report, I concluded:  ... before any suggestions can be made as to how the evidence from UMC should be interpreted, the combined evidence from individual sites, as well as the seeming increase in the number of sites occupied over time, will have to be considered ... to see if the evidence suggests an increase in the intensity of occupation of the area as a whole. (Attenbrow 1981: 131)  I later suggested that if the low artefact densities in the upper levels of sites such as Deep Creek and Mussel did reflect a low rate of artefact discard, then they may ‘cancel out’ the higher numbers in the upper levels in Loggers when calculating the trends in the catchment as a whole (Attenbrow 1982b: 77). These statements are reviewed below in the light of archaeological evidence from the random sampling units. The terminology used differs from that in the salvage report. The terms ‘archaeological deposit’ and ‘habitation’ are used rather than ‘site’ or ‘shelter’. ‘Archaeological deposits’ were initially assumed to be the debris from activities or processes associated with habitation and thus, in this and the following chapters, sites with archaeological deposit are referred to as ‘habitations’. Sites with archaeological deposit are also referred to as ‘inhabited sites’. Whether some of these ‘habitations’ were base camps and others transit camps or locations where other daytime activities were undertaken is explored in the final chapter, when explanations and interpretations for dramatic changes in the catchment’s habitation and artefact indices are proposed. In the salvage report, I specifically used the term ‘shelter/s’ to indicate that the documented trends related only to habitation in rockshelters, and that the trends in the use of open locations for habitation purposes may have been quite different. I still assume this may be the case, though the term ‘habitation’ has been used in the title to data sets and indices to indicate that the quantitative changes relate only to archaeological deposit (cf. Ross 1985: 84) and not to the other types of archaeological trait recorded in the catchment. On occasions where the term ‘site’ is used, it refers only to those sites with archaeological deposit (i.e., habitations or inhabited sites). Unless otherwise stated, the term ‘artefact’ refers to stone artefacts (flaked and ground) and does not include implements of organic materials. terra australis 21 117 </page> <page sequence="4">        What’s changing: population size or land-use patterns? The archaeology of Upper Mangrove Creek, Sydney Basin Data from the random sampling units are presented in two different ways:  1. according to typological phases (as used in the salvage report); and,  2. according to successive millennia.  These are referred to as the phased sequence and the millennial sequence respectively. Using these two different methods of presentation illustrates how the trends documented in each of the habitation and artefact indices can vary in a manner which may lead to different interpretations, particularly in respect to the timing and coincidence of various changes in the archaeological record (cf. Frankel 1988; Ulm and Hall 1996). The data sets The data sets include all deposits for which it was possible to assign an age of establishment and abandonment, whether through radiocarbon determinations or other methods (Chapter 3, Table 6.2). To use only the archaeological deposits with radiocarbon ages was considered inappropriate as they are a biased selection of the habitations. For my PhD thesis, the percentage of habitations with small assemblages in shallow deposits that was selected for radiocarbon dating was lower (i.e., 37%) than the percentage of multi-phase (multi- millennium) habitations with abundant artefacts. McDonald (1994: 76–8) was critical of the inclusion of the undated habitations with small numbers of artefacts in the habitation indices and, for her study, she recalculated the indices using only seven sites with &gt;100 excavated artefacts. On this basis, she concluded that no new shelters were established and there was no increase in the number of habitations used in the second and first millennia BP — thus showing ‘a consistent or stable use of the same shelters over the last three thousand years’ (McDonald 1994: 77). However, in her recalculations, McDonald ignored the existence of four habitations which have radiocarbon ages, two of which are in the second millennium BP and one in the first millennium BP. There is no reason why habitations with radiocarbon ages should not be included in any reanalysis of the data. Inclusion of these sites into her data set would show an increase in habitation establishment and number of habitations used in the last 2000 years, albeit still not as substantial as the increase seen in Figure 6.2B — but still an increase. Inclusion of the undated habitations with shallow deposits and small numbers of artefacts in my 1987 data sets, and interpretation of the land and resource- use patterns in the catchment based on ‘all datable deposits’, is supported by the four additional radiocarbon ages obtained in 1995 (see Chapter 3). The following analyses are based therefore on data sets which include all ‘possible’ archaeological deposits; that is, all deposits for which it was possible to assign an age of establishment and abandonment. Trends in both of the habitation indices have also been presented for data sets including only the habitations with radiocarbon ages. Use of these data sets is not considered appropriate for interpreting the catchment’s archaeological record, but they have been included to show the trends if such data sets are used. The indices To measure change over time in the numbers of habitations (archaeological deposits) and stone artefacts, the following data sets and indices were calculated for both the phased sequence and the millennial sequence:  Archaeological deposits (habitations):  1. the number of habitations established in successive time periods; 2. the rate of habitation establishment in successive time periods;  3. the number of habitations used in successive time periods;  terra australis 21 118 </page> <page sequence="5">              Temporal distribution: quantitative changes in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment 4. the rate of habitation establishment in each topographic zone in successive time periods; 5. the number of habitations used in each topographic zone in successive time periods; 6. millennial growth rates for habitation establishment and number of habitations used in each period; 7. average annual growth rates for habitation establishment and number of habitations used in each period. Stone artefacts:  8. the estimated number of artefacts accumulated in individual habitations in successive time periods; 9. the rate of artefact accumulation in individual habitations in successive time periods; 10. the estimated number of artefacts accumulated in the catchment in successive time periods; 11. the rate of artefact accumulation in the catchment as a whole (referred to as the local artefact accumulation rate) in successive time periods;  12. the number of artefacts accumulated in each topographic zone of the catchment in successive time periods; 13. the rate of artefact accumulation in the catchment in each topographic zone in successive time periods; 14. millennial growth rates; and, 15. average annual growth rates. The number of habitations established and the number of artefacts accumulated in each time period (i.e., each phase or millennium) were converted into rates (the rate of habitation establishment and the rate of artefact accumulation) which take account of variation in the lengths of time in each typological phase. Rate is calculated as the number of habitations established or the number of artefacts accumulated per millennium. I am principally concerned with four indices:  • the rate of habitation establishment; • the number of habitations used; • the rate of artefact accumulation; and, • the local rate of artefact accumulation.  They are referred to collectively as the habitation and artefact indices. The term ‘habitation indices’ has been used when referring collectively to more than one of the indices relating to habitations. Where I refer simply to ‘the indices’, I mean the indices relating to artefacts as well as habitations. The magnitude of increases or decreases in the indices has been referred to as: marked, substantial or dramatic, with dramatic being the greatest in magnitude. In general discussions, to avoid unwieldy sentences, the term ‘dramatic’ is used sometimes in a ‘generic’ sense to refer collectively to changes in several sites or regions, some of which may be marked or substantial. The habitation indices The time or period in which an archaeological deposit began to accumulate is taken as the date at which habitation began; it is referred to as the date of habitation establishment. Some images or grooves in some rockshelters may have been created before habitation was ‘established’ in them, but this cannot be identified. The term ‘number of habitations used in successive time periods’ refers to the number of habitations in use by the end of each period (phase or millennium). It does not imply that the number of habitations stated as being used in each particular period were all terra australis 21 119 </page> <page sequence="6">            What’s changing: population size or land-use patterns? The archaeology of Upper Mangrove Creek, Sydney Basin inhabited at the same time — simply that they were all inhabited at some time during or by the end of that particular period. Although habitations are described as being used in successive time periods, it is assumed they were inhabited discontinuously or intermittently.  In the salvage report, the concepts ‘number of habitations used’ and ‘rate of habitation establishment’ are not clearly differentiated. The rate at which habitations were established and the number of habitations used per unit time are treated separately in this monograph and provide different sets of information about habitation and land-use patterns. If all habitations continued to be used once they were established (albeit discontinuously, intermittently or cyclically), the establishment of further habitations would mean an increasing number of habitations were used in successive periods of time. The number of habitations used can increase no matter whether the habitation establishment rates remain stable, increase or decrease. However, if all habitations were used for a short time in only one period, the habitation establishment rate has to have increased in order for the number of habitations used to increase. To calculate the number of habitations used within a particular period of time, it was therefore necessary to know the date at which the habitations were established, the total length of time over which they were inhabited, and whether there were any sustained periods of abandonment. The artefact indices The rates of artefact accumulation are based on the estimated total number of artefacts accumulated in each period in each archaeological deposit. The artefact accumulation rates were calculated at three levels: for individual habitations, for the catchment as a whole and for each topographic zone. For the catchment as a whole, this is referred to as the local rate of artefact accumulation. Calculating artefact accumulation rates Artefact accumulation rates were calculated by a commonly adopted method in which the ‘rate’ for each spit or level is expressed as the number of artefacts accumulated (or discarded) per millennium or century (e.g., Hughes and Djohadze 1980: Figs 11–13; Morwood 1981: 32; Kelly 1982: 31–49; David and Chant 1995; papers in Morwood and Hobbs 1995b). The following information was used:  1. the number of artefacts (or implements) in each spit or level; 2. the estimated length of time over which each spit or level accumulated; and, 3. the area of each spit or level excavated. To gain 2., a depth/age curve was drawn based on:  4. the depth of each spit or level;  5. the age of one (preferably basal or near basal) but ideally more levels throughout the depth of deposit, and an estimate of the time when the site was last used; and, 6. the depth to which the age estimations relate. Where the area excavated was not constant in each spit or level, rates were standardised as the number of artefacts/square metre/unit time (e.g., Hughes 1977: Table 5.6, Fig. 5.12; Johnson 1979: Fig. 5, Table 3).  The artefact accumulation rate for the total catchment in each phase and each millennium was estimated by combining the estimated total number of artefacts accumulated in all archaeological deposits for each phase and each millennium. Catchment trends are referred to as the local rate of artefact accumulation to differentiate them from the artefact accumulation rates in individual deposits. Combining the total number of artefacts in levels of comparable age in all archaeological deposits is considered valid for several reasons:  terra australis 21 120 </page> <page sequence="7">          Temporal distribution: quantitative changes in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment • in the same way that it is valid to combine the total number of artefacts in levels of the same age from all excavated squares in a single archaeological deposit to produce a unitary trend for that site. The catchment is viewed as a single unit in the same way that an archaeological deposit or site is; • at a regional level in 1788, the catchment was within the territory of a single language group (Darginung) and probably only part of the territory of a single clan (though their social, subsistence, economic and trading networks would have extended over a much wider area than the lands associated with both of these groups);  • subsistence activities are assumed to have been dispersed across the land and not restricted to a single specific location during periods of occupation. During each visit to the catchment, except when transiting through the country via the major ridge lines forming the catchment watershed, people are likely to have visited more than one topographic zone and may have ‘used’ more than one site/archaeological trait of the same or different nature. Where relevant data are available, calculating artefact accumulation rates is a fairly straightforward exercise. It is often more difficult to decide what constitutes a dramatic increase, when the ‘most dramatic increase’ occurred, and/or when it began and ended. In some cases, this uncertainty means varying interpretations can be made as to when significant quantitative change occurred and with what other events or processes it was correlated. The shortcomings and limits in using artefact accumulation rates are discussed in Chapter 5. Growth rates Growth rates have also been calculated for the rates of habitation establishment, the numbers of habitations used and the local rates of artefact accumulation. Growth rates for these indices assist in illustrating the nature and magnitude of changes and are pertinent to later discussions about the use of archaeological evidence as measures of population change (Chapter 8). They were calculated to determine whether there were variations in the ‘rate’ at which changes took place in the indices over time; that is, variations in the growth rates indicate whether the rate of change slowed down or accelerated. The rate of change can slow down even though ‘increases’ still occur; for example, increases from 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 to 7/millennium represent growth rates of +50%, +33%, +25% and +40%.  The growth rates thus help to describe the nature of the quantitative changes which occurred and can assist in determining whether the dramatic increases in the more recent periods were produced simply by exponential population increase; that is, if there was a constant growth rate. Changes in the growth rates for the indices may be as important as the actual size of the increases and decreases and need explaining in investigating dramatic quantitative changes in the archaeological record.  Calculating growth rates Millennial growth rates are calculated for the habitation and artefact indices, but average annual growth rates were the most expedient growth rates to calculate for local artefact accumulation rates. Growth rates can be expressed in two ways: as a percentage figure (+50%) or a multiplier (×1.5). Both have been presented as each are used in the literature cited; archaeologists often use multipliers (e.g., Hughes and Lampert 1982; Ross 1984), while demographers usually quote average annual growth rates for population increase as percentages (e.g., Ammerman et al. 1976; Hassan 1981; Gray 1985). Percentage figures were calculated using the following equation: the habitation establishment rate for the later period minus the rate for the earlier period divided by the rate for the earlier period multiplied by 100. The multiplier can be derived by dividing the rate for the later period by the rate for the terra australis 21 121 </page> <page sequence="8">                    What’s changing: population size or land-use patterns? The archaeology of Upper Mangrove Creek, Sydney Basin earlier period; for example, a change from 3 habitations/millennium to 6 habitations/ millennium, a twofold (×2) increase, represents a growth rate of 100%.  Average annual growth rates were calculated using a small computer program written for this purpose. For the habitation indices, they are based on the number in each phase/millennium and the length of the period (i.e., phase or millennium). Growth rates for the local artefact accumulation rates are based on the duration of the period (i.e., phase or millennium) and estimated total number of artefacts accumulated during that period. Average annual growth rates were not calculated for individual archaeological deposits. Changes in the rates of habitation establishment Changes in the rates of habitation establishment are based on the period in which habitations were established according to both the phased and millennial sequence (i.e., the period in which they were first inhabited) (Table 6.2). The estimated period of establishment of habitation is based on:  1. radiocarbon dates:  (a) if the charcoal sample dated was obtained from the basal spit, this was taken as the approximate date at which the archaeological deposit began to accumulate (but note discussion in Hughes and Lampert 1982: 19–20); (b) if the charcoal sample was not from the basal spit, extrapolation back to the basal spit was made on the basis of a depth/age curve;  2. the phase or millennium into which the stone artefact assemblage in the basal spits was assigned; and, 3. where necessary, the depth of accumulated deposit.  Phased sequence Eleven of the 30 habitations have more than one phase represented (multi-phase habitations). The remaining 19 have only one phase and are referred to as single-phase habitations. In each of the multi-phase habitations, the phases are successive and the most recent phase is always represented. The dates, artefacts and nature of the deposits indicate that the single-phase habitations all belong to the most recent phase. The number of habitations established varied in each successive typological phase — it was relatively low in the first three phases (four, three and four respectively), but jumped dramatically in the final phase to 19 (Tables 6.2 and 6.3).  The rate of habitation establishment increased in each successive phase, with the most recent phase (4) having the highest. The rate increased from 0.6/millennium during Phase 1, to 1.4 in Phase 2, 3.3 in Phase 3 and 12.7 in Phase 4 (Table 6.3 and Fig. 6.1A). These rates according to the typological phases suggest that substantial change took place in each of the phases, that is, after three points in time — ca 5000 BP, ca 2800 BP and ca 1600 BP— and that the most dramatic increase occurred after 1600 BP. If only the 15 radiocarbon-dated archaeological deposits are used, the habitation establishment rates are, of course, much lower (0.6, 0.9, 2.5 and 4.0/millennium for Phases 1 to 4 respectively) (Table 6.4, marked as * in Fig. 6.1A). Increases still occur, but the increase for Phase 4 is not as dramatic as that based on all habitations. Growth rates. The growth rate for the habitation establishment rate in Phase 4 is substantially greater than in Phases 3 and 2. In Phase 4, it is almost four times that of the previous phase, whereas in Phases 2 and 3 the establishment rate is more than double that of the previous phase (Table 6.5).  terra australis 21 122 </page> <page sequence="9">         Temporal distribution: quantitative changes in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment Table 6.2 Upper Mangrove Creek catchment: random sampling units.

Millennial sequence The millennial sequence indicates that there was a marked increase in the habitation establishment rate in the fourth millennium BP, a particularly dramatic rise in the second millennium BP and a further substantial increase in the first millennium BP (Fig. 6.1B). The period of habitation can be divided into three: 12,000 BP to 7000 BP, 7000 BP to 2000 BP and 2000 BP to contact. The seventh millennium BP is taken as the period in which change begins as it is from that time onwards that habitations were established in each successive millennium. terra australis 21 123 </page> <page sequence="10">                What’s changing: population size or land-use patterns?

The most recent millennium shows stability in the habitation establishment rate rather than the increase which is indicated when all habitations are included. Growth rates. Because habitation establishment was infrequent and the number involved was very low in the period 12,000 BP to 7000 BP, it was not considered meaningful to calculate the millennial growth rates for this period (Table 6.6). In the fourth and first millennia BP the growth rate doubles, whereas in the second millennium BP the increase is three- to fourfold. The second millennium BP thus had the highest growth rate throughout the catchment’s period of recorded use. Comments on rates of habitation establishment At one habitation (Kangaroo and Echidna), the period of establishment could fall within one  of two different millennia. The extrapolated date does not alter the phase in which habitation began, but places the date of establishment some three millennia earlier (i.e., from the seventh to the 10th millennium BP).

Excavation ceased at Kangaroo and Echidna and four other archaeological deposits before bedrock was reached (Anadara, Bird Tracks, Boronia and Mangrove Mansions) (see Chapter 5, Table 3.4). In addition, in three other rockshelters (Elongated Figure, Harris Gully and Uprooted Tree), the base of the excavations is sloping bedrock. It is possible therefore that there may be earlier evidence of habitations in other parts of the deposits at these eight sites. However, the area of deposit in the rockshelters is small and the slope gradients are low, so the extra depth of deposit and/or time may not be great. The period of establishment for these eight archaeological deposits was assigned on the basis of the archaeological materials recovered and the radiocarbon dates at three of the sites: five to Phase 4, one to Phase 3 (Elongated Figure) and two (Kangaroo and Echidna and Uprooted Tree) to Phase 1. If the period of habitation establishment for the archaeological deposits assigned to Phases 3 and 4 was earlier than assumed, this would only add support to the argument that early deposits were not necessarily scoured out of rockshelters. Habitation in ALL these shelters would have had to have begun earlier and to have begun in the SAME phase, for trends in the habitation establishment rates to be affected. Because of the nature and estimated remaining depth of the deposit, and the stone artefact assemblages in the basal spits at these archaeological deposits, this situation is considered unlikely (see Chapter 3, Excavations undertaken). Similar arguments can be made about trends according to the millennial sequence. terra australis 21 127 </page> <page sequence="14">                                 What’s changing: population size or land-use patterns? The archaeology of Upper Mangrove Creek, Sydney Basin Changes in the numbers of habitations used The stratigraphy of each of the archaeological deposits suggests that, except in one case, once a habitation was established, it continued to be used into the most recent phase — not necessarily continuously, but without any major long-term breaks in habitation. That is, there were no breaks which were of sufficient length to allow sterile layers to form or one of the assemblages in the stone artefact sequence to be missing. The exception is Two Moths, where the only evidence for habitation is freshwater mussel shell (Appendix 3). The shell occurs in a single level mid-depth within the excavated deposit. The age of this level has been estimated as some time within the second millennium BP. Two Moths is thus excluded as a habitation in use in the first millennium BP (e.g., in Table 6.10). Phased sequence The number of habitations used by the end of each successive phase increased markedly so that the number of habitations used during the most recent phase was greater than in any previous phase. Four habitations were used in Phase 1, seven in Phase 2, 11 in Phase 3, and 30 in the final phase (4) (Fig. 6.2A). The growth rate between the two final phases (×2.72) was greater than at other times (×1.75 and ×1.57) (Table 6.5). Millennial sequence According to the millennial sequence, the increase in the number of habitations used was very slow until the ninth millennium BP, after which there was a gradual increase until the third millennium BP. There were then substantial increases in both the second and first millennia BP (Fig. 6.2B). The increase in the first millennium BP was slightly greater than that in the second millennium BP. When only the 15 radiocarbon-dated archaeological deposits are used (marked as * in Fig. 6.2B), the trend in the number of habitations used is similar to that shown when all habitations are included, though the increases in the second and first millennia BP are not as substantial. Growth rates. The highest growth rates occurred in the second and first millennia BP (×1.78 and ×1.81 respectively), as well as the ninth millennium BP (×2) — though the latter situation represents an increase from one to two sites (Table 6.6). Changes in the habitation indices in each topographic zone by the end of each successive time period  Phased sequence The distribution of habitations in each of the topographic zones in each phase varied over time (Fig. 6.3 and Tables 6.7 and 6.9):  Phase 1 — four habitations were established in three of the topographic zones (the main valley bottoms [VB-MC], subsidiary ridgesides [RS-SC], and periphery ridgetops [RT-PERI]). The four habitations were spread widely over the catchment; Phase 2 — seven habitations used; the additional three habitations were established in only two of the three topographic zones in which the Phase 1 habitations were recorded (the main valley bottoms [VB-MC] and periphery ridgetops [RT-PERI]); Phase 3 — 11 habitations used; the additional four habitations were established in only two of the three topographic zones in which the Phase 1 habitations were established (subsidiary ridgesides [RS-SC] and periphery ridgetops [RT-PERI]). terra australis 21 128 </page> <page sequence="15">     Temporal distribution: quantitative changes in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment A.

Habitations now established in all six of the topographic zones — that is, habitations were established in three zones which were previously uninhabited: peninsula ridgetops (RT-PEN), the main ridgesides (RS- MC) and the subsidiary valley bottoms (VB-SC). These three zones are those in which the least archaeological evidence was recorded. Thus, the first habitations established were widely and sparsely distributed but in a restricted number of topographic zones (three). It was only in the most recent phase (4) that all six topographic zones were inhabited. That is, in the most recent phase, habitation occurred in topographic zones which were previously uninhabited (or had not been inhabited to a degree or in a manner which was archaeologically visible at the level of fieldwork undertaken).  Millennial sequence Trends shown in the millennial sequence reveal that the main valley bottom was the first zone in which habitations were established; then the periphery ridgetops and later the subsidiary ridgesides (or vice versa, if the extrapolated date for Kangaroo and Echidna is proved correct) (Fig. 6.4 and Tables 6.8 and 6.10). Establishment of habitations in the subsidiary valley bottoms and the peninsula ridgetops takes place in the second millennium BP and it is not until the first millennium BP that the main ridgesides are finally inhabited.

Estimated total numbers of artefacts accumulated in individual habitations varied equally widely (from &lt;100 to almost 250,000) (Table 4.12). Artefact accumulation rates for individual habitations have been calculated for each of the phases and millennia in which the habitations were used (Figs 6.5 and 6.6; Tables 6.12 and 6.13 respectively). Artefact accumulation rates are based on the estimated total number of artefacts in an archaeological deposit and on the estimated total number within each spit/phase/millennium (Tables 6.11 and 6.13). The estimated total number of artefacts was used to avoid problems associated with inter-site variability in both the amount excavated in each site and the area of each archaeological deposit (i.e., in the number of square metres likely to contain cultural materials) at each site.  The artefact accumulation rates did not always continue to increase in each of the habitations (i.e., a similar trend to that seen in the salvage program [Attenbrow 1981, 1982b]). Each habitation had its own ‘history of accumulation’ or ‘habitation history’. Variations occurred not only in the date at which each habitation was established and the estimated total number of artefacts accumulated, but also in:  1. the rates at which artefacts accumulated in particular periods; and,  2. the direction and timing of the dramatic or substantial changes in the artefact accumulation rates. At habitations used for more than one phase or more than two millennia, long-term changes in the artefact accumulation rates are evident. terra australis 21 132 </page> <page sequence="19">     Temporal distribution: quantitative changes in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment 12TH  MILL  BP                                                  11TH  MILL  BP                                                 10TH  MILL  BP 9TH  MILL  BP                                                   8TH  MILL  BP                                             7TH  MILL  BP N 0          4          8            km     6TH  MILL  BP                                                 5TH  MILL  BP                                                     4TH  MILL  BP 3 2 3 2 3 3 3RD  MILL  BP                                               2ND  MILL  BP                                                      1ST  MILL  BP Archaeological deposits             possibly used Figure 6.4 Upper Mangrove Creek catchment: random sampling units.

The estimated total number of artefacts accumulated at each habitation in each phase is set out in Table 6.11 and the rates of artefact accumulation in Figure 6.5 and Table 6.12. At all but two of the seven habitations used for more than two phases, there were substantial or dramatic increases in the rate at which artefacts accumulated in Phase 3. The exceptions were Kangaroo and Echidna and Uprooted Tree, where the rates increased, but on a smaller scale than elsewhere. At five of the 11 multi-phase habitations, the artefact accumulation rates continued to increase in successive periods. At the other six habitations, there was a decrease, sometimes relatively dramatic, in the accumulation rates in the upper levels. terra australis 21 138 </page> <page sequence="25">       Temporal distribution: quantitative changes in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment Millennial sequence Fifteen habitations were used for more than two millennia, and seven for more than 3000 years (Fig. 6.6 and Table 6.13). At the seven habitations used for more than 3000 years:  1. a dramatic or substantial increase in the artefact accumulation rates can be seen; this occurred within the last 3000 years and usually in the third or second millennium BP. At only one habitation (Loggers, where the rate of artefact accumulation continued to increase until contact) did a substantial increase occur in the first millennium BP; 2. there was also a dramatic or substantial decrease in the artefact accumulation rate in all habitations except Loggers and Uprooted Tree; at the other five habitations, this decrease occurred after the dramatic increase mentioned in 1. above. At one habitation (Emu Tracks 2) it began in the second millennium BP and at the other four it was in the first millennium BP. At Uprooted Tree a decrease occurred in the first millennium BP, but it was not marked. In the two sites where habitation is estimated to have begun in the third millennium BP, Delight and Boat Cave, the former had a decrease while the latter had an increase in the first millennium BP.  The millennial sequence also indicates that:  1. decreased artefact accumulation rates occurred at a greater number of habitations in the most recent period (i.e., all but Loggers and Boat Cave), although the decrease at Uprooted Tree was not very great; 2. the substantial increases and decreases in the accumulation rates did not necessarily occur at the same time in all habitations — at some the increase began in the third millennium BP and in others the second millennium BP. The substantial decrease occurred in most habitations in the last 1000 years, but at Emu Tracks 2 it began in the second millennium BP— at the same time as increases were beginning at others; 3. at Loggers, there was a period with relatively high artefact accumulation rates in the 10th and ninth millennia BP, that is, within Phase 1. At Kangaroo and Echidna, there may have been a period of relatively high artefact accumulation in the eighth millennium BP, but the presence of artefacts dating back to 10,000 BP at this habitation is equivocal at present; and, 4. the growth rates at individual habitations varied widely.  The millennial sequence reveals that the relationships between the use of the various habitations within the catchment were more complex than those indicated by the phased sequence. Variability in the timing, direction and magnitude of the changes in the artefact accumulation rates in individual habitations, as documented for the catchment, have not been documented in the same detail anywhere else in Australia. The variability documented for the catchment suggests that local habitation and land-use patterns in other regions are likely to be more complex than models based on less detailed site and artefact distribution studies.  Changes in the local rate of artefact accumulation — the catchment  While trends at individual habitations reflect the manner in which people inhabited specific locations within the catchment and how they occupied the catchment once they were there, the catchment trends are pertinent to discussions about long-term use of the catchment in a regional context (cf. Foley 1981b: 175–6). So, in assessing changes in the catchment as a whole, and at a topographic level, I used a non-site approach (Foley 1981a, 1981b, 1981c; Thomas 1975) — an approach now more commonly used in eastern Australia, especially with open archaeological deposits (Robins 1997; MacDonald et al. 1998: 37; MacDonald and Davidson n.d: 153–5; Holdaway et al. 1998; Doelman et al. 2001). terra australis 21 139 </page> <page sequence="26">     What’s changing: population size or land-use patterns?

OF  ARTEFACTS / MILLENNIUM (x1000) </page> <page sequence="27">               Temporal distribution: quantitative changes in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment Phased sequence According to the phased sequence, the local artefact accumulation rate was higher in Phase 3 than in any other phase; that is, there was a peak accumulation period between ca 2800 BP and ca 1600 BP, and in the most recent phase the artefact accumulation rates decreased (Fig. 6.7A). Growth rates. The growth rates for the local artefact accumulation rates varied dramatically over time (Table 6.5). Between Phases 1 and 2 the growth rate was low (x1.35), but in Phase 3 it was almost 20 times higher than in Phase 2. In Phase 4, the local artefact accumulation rate was half that of Phase 3 (x0.5). Millennial sequence The millennial sequence shows that there was an initial slow but steady increase in the local artefact accumulation rate, but then it increased dramatically in the third millennium BP (Fig. 6.7B). A similarly high rate was maintained in the second millennium BP, after which it decreased substantially in the first millennium BP. In the 10th and ninth millennia BP, there was also a minor peak in the local artefact accumulation rates, which is masked in the phased sequence. Growth rates. The local artefact accumulation rate in the third millennium BP was more than 14 times higher than that of the fourth millennium BP (Table 6.6). The growth rate in the 10th millennium was also very high (x6.4), though the actual numbers of artefacts involved were lower than in the more recent periods. The exceptionally high growth rate in the 11th millennium BP (x25.7) does not warrant undue emphasis since it is presently based on small numbers of artefacts from a single habitation, i.e., Loggers. The decline in the growth rate in the eighth millennium BP (x0.23) was also greater than the decline that occurred in the first millennium BP (x0.57). These figures suggest that dramatic changes also occurred in the early-Holocene and were not restricted to the late- Holocene.  Comments on local artefact accumulation rates Variations in the direction of trends in individual archaeological deposits in the most recent period were noted in the storage area data set (Attenbrow 1981: 131; 1982b: 77). Although I speculated that the decreases in the upper levels of some archaeological deposits may ‘cancel out’ the increases in others, at that time I did not envisage that the overall trend would be towards such a substantial decrease in the local artefact accumulation rate in the last 1000 years. The substantial decrease in the local artefact accumulation rate during the most recent phase and millennium is in strong contrast with the continuing increases which are documented for the habitation establishment rates and numbers of habitations used in the successive periods of time. It is possible that the documented trends are biased because of the small area excavated in some archaeological deposits (discussed in Chapter 3, Excavation strategy and methods, and Chapter 5, Sample size), but it appears unlikely and can be tested only by further excavation in each archaeological deposit. Much of the variation between Phase 3 and 4 is due to the large difference between these phases at Emu Tracks 2. If this habitation was excluded from the data set, Phase 4 would have had a higher rate of artefact accumulation than Phase 3. In the millennial sequence, if Emu Tracks 2 was excluded from the figures, the rate for the third millennium BP would drop dramatically, but the second millennium BP still has a higher rate than the first. However, there is no reason why Emu Tracks 2 — as opposed to any other archaeological deposit — should be excluded from the sample, given the nature of the selection procedures.  To check whether the observed pattern in the local artefact accumulation rates (in particular, the lower number of artefacts in the most recent period) was due to mis-allocation of terra australis 21 141 </page> <page sequence="28">                What’s changing: population size or land-use patterns? The archaeology of Upper Mangrove Creek, Sydney Basin spits to a wrong phase, various ways of combining the totals were calculated. Mis-allocation could occur where diagnostic artefacts were not present; it could also occur if the vertical distribution of such artefacts had been altered by subsequent disturbance, such as treadage and scuffage. The most drastic situation that could have occurred is that all top spits in Phase 3 belong to Phase 4 and all bottom spits in Phase 3 belong to Phase 2. In this situation, Phase 4 does have a greater artefact accumulation rate than Phase 3. However, there is no reason to believe this happened in ALL archaeological deposits. In addition, many archaeological deposits have only two spits in Phase 3, and, if diagnostic artefacts representing Phase 3 are present, then at least one of the spits must fall into Phase 3. If the Phase 4 habitations without diagnostic features belonged elsewhere, this would only accentuate the decrease in Phase 4. Although mis-allocating spits and/or assemblages to specific millennia may have occurred for the reasons outlined above, the fact that both sequences produced similar trends indicates that the status of the postulated trends are secure enough to use as a basis for interpretative and explanatory models for the temporal changes in the habitation and land-use patterns in the catchment. Changes in the rate of artefact accumulation in each topographic zone in successive time periods  The number of artefacts accumulated in each topographic zone varied widely, with the highest number being on the periphery ridgetops (Tables 6.14 to 6.16). The number of artefacts and the rate at which they accumulated in each zone also varied considerably over time. Phased sequence The periphery ridgetops had the highest number of artefacts accumulated and the highest artefact accumulation rates in all phases except Phase 1 (Tables 6.14 and 6.15). In Phase 1, the highest number and highest rate were in the main valley bottoms.  In Phase 2, although there was a slight increase in the local accumulation rate, the rate decreased in the main valley bottoms while increasing in the other two inhabited zones (subsidiary ridgesides and periphery ridgetops). In Phase 3, the increase in artefact accumulation rates is dramatic in all zones, but the growth rate is much greater in the main valley bottoms and periphery ridgetops than on the subsidiary ridgesides (×18, ×21 and ×10 respectively). Phase 4 had several changes — at the same time as there were decreased rates in all zones previously inhabited (with the periphery ridgetops having a much greater decrease than the main valley bottoms and subsidiary ridgesides), the remaining three zones were inhabited for the first time (peninsula ridgetops, main ridgesides and subsidiary valley bottoms). However, the accumulation rates in these three zones are very much lower than in the three zones inhabited throughout the sequence. Changes in the artefact accumulation rates which occurred in each phase therefore did not happen uniformly in each of the topographic zones. Millennial sequence The millennial sequence shows a similar long-term pattern to the phased sequence. However, it reinforces the habitation indices, indicating that artefact accumulation first began in the main valley bottom, did not begin on the peninsula ridgetops and in the subsidiary valley bottoms until the second millennium BP, and it was only in the first millennium BP that it began on the main ridgesides (Table 6.16). It also shows that the peak in the artefact accumulation rates in the 10th  and ninth millennia BP took place in the main valley bottoms. terra australis 21 142 </page> <page sequence="29">               Temporal distribution: quantitative changes in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment Table 6.14 Upper Mangrove Creek catchment: random sampling units.

The archaeology of Upper Mangrove Creek, Sydney Basin Discussion In the above analyses of the habitation and artefact indices, several observations are made:  1. the trends observed when millennial divisions are used as the basis for presenting the quantitative changes differ in their timing and nature from those based on typological phases;  2. data sets including only habitations with radiocarbon ages indicate different late- Holocene trends compared with data sets including ‘all datable habitations’; 3. the timing and direction of the catchment trends in the habitation establishment rates, the number of habitations used, and the local artefact accumulation rates, were not uniform;  4. the growth rates in each of the three indices were not constant over time;  5. timing and direction of the changes in the artefact accumulation rates at individual habitations varied widely; 6. the trends in the habitation establishment rates, the number of habitations used and artefact accumulation rates in each topographic zone varied widely; and, 7. the timing of the quantitative changes and the appearance of changes in typology, technology and raw material did not necessarily coincide. Typological phases versus millennial divisions Use of the typological phases suggests that either marked, substantial or dramatic changes occurred in both habitation indices and the local artefact accumulation rates at or after three points in time: ca 5000 BP (the beginning of Phase 2), ca 2800 BP (the beginning of Phase 3) and ca 1600 BP (the beginning of Phase 4) (Figs 6.1A, 6.2A and 6.7A).  The millennial sequence indicates slightly different timing for the changes (Fig. 6.1B, 6.2B and 6.7B):  1. in the habitation establishment rates, there was:  • an increase in the seventhmillennium BP (represented by the beginning of habitation establishment in each millennium), which is not identifiable in the phased sequence; • a marked increase in the fourth, rather than the fifth millennium BP; and, • dramatic increases in both the second and first millennia BP, so that the increases appear as a continual process, rather than a single dramatic increase occurring only halfway through the second millennium BP with the same level being maintained into the first millennium BP; 2. in the numbers of habitations used, there was:  • a gradual increase over time until the second millennium BP, rather than a marked and sudden increase in the fifth millennium BP after a period of no or very little change; and, • dramatic increases in both the second and first millennia BP, which are part of a continuing process rather than only one dramatic increase occurring halfway through the second millennium BPwith the same level being maintained in the first millennium BP; 3. in the local artefact accumulation rates there was:  • a small peak in the local artefact accumulation rates in the ninth and 10th millennia BP (i.e., in the early Holocene), which is not apparent in the phased sequence;  • a sudden and dramatic increase in the thirdmillennium BP; • the rate remained high in the secondmillennium BP, i.e., the high rates extended over a longer period than in the phased sequence; • a substantial decrease in the most recent period, but it was in the firstmillennium BP, rather than in second millennium BP (i.e., after 1600 BP). terra australis 21 144 </page> <page sequence="31">            Temporal distribution: quantitative changes in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment The above comparison of the millennial and phased sequences enables variations in the trends produced by each method to be observed. While the overall trends remain the same in terms of direction, use of millennial sequences brings out differences (sometimes subtle) in the timing of the changes, as well as the nature of the changes (i.e., whether a change was gradual or sudden). Temporal boundaries for the phased sequence can in some sense accommodate the interpretations based on the millennial sequence; that is, the changes occurred within the dates of the phased sequence. However, when changes are stated as occurring in a phase or in any dated period, there is usually an assumption (explicit or implicit) that the change took place at the beginning of the specified period — which need not be the case. In general, analyses based on data from the random sampling units support the 1981 postulated trends for the storage area habitations which included ‘the more speculative data’ and indicate that there was a dramatic increase in the number of habitations being established in the Late Bondaian (Phase 4). In addition, the phased sequences suggest that in Phase 4 there was an inverse relationship between changes in the two habitations indices and the local artefact accumulation rate (the former continuing to increase and the latter decreasing dramatically), and that these changes coincided in time. In contrast, trends based on the millennial sequences indicate that (a) the rates of increase during the early-Holocene were more even than the phased sequences indicate; and (b) ca 5000 BP was not a time of significant change in any of the indices, with the dramatic changes occurring after 3000 BP. The millennial sequences also enable the complex relationships between habitation establishment, habitations used and local artefact accumulation rates in the late-Holocene to be more clearly identified. For example, initially, in the third millennium BP, a dramatic increase occurred in the local artefact accumulation rate while the habitation establishment rate and the number of habitations used were relatively low. It was only in the second millennium BP that the habitation establishment rate and the number of habitations used increased dramatically (i.e., while the local artefact accumulation rate was almost stable). Then, in the first millennium BP, the habitation establishment rate and number of habitations used continued to increase whereas the local artefact accumulation rate dropped substantially. Use of millennial divisions demonstrates that major quantitative changes in habitation and artefact indices did not necessarily coincide in time, direction or magnitude.  The above comparative analysis of the trends in the phased and millennial sequences illustrates how grouping materials from several excavation units into phases based on typological (or other) changes, which may have extended over several millennia, can mask the time at which changes in other events and processes took place. In addition, it can suggest they were sudden, or even gradual or long-term processes rather than short-term events; the reverse may equally apply (but cf. Morwood 1981: 30). It could be argued that using millennial divisions still forces changes to appear as if they occurred either earlier or later than they actually did — that is, at the millennial boundary rather than at some time within a millennium — but this will also depend on how an author describes and/or interprets the graphs. An alternative may be to combine dated boundaries (where available) and millennial divisions within units that extend over several millennia. However, the main implication of this comparison is that each aspect of the archaeological record is likely to have its own trajectory and temporal sequence, and therefore should not be presented in terms of previously constructed sequences designed for other purposes. Each strand of evidence from the archaeological record (e.g., artefact types, technological traits, raw materials, artefact accumulation rates, habitation establishment rates, numbers of habitations used and faunal assemblages) should be analysed separately and have its own sequence established before comparisons are made and correlations, if any, identified. Different methods of presentation and different analytical methods may also contribute to terra australis 21 145 </page> <page sequence="32">               What’s changing: population size or land-use patterns? The archaeology of Upper Mangrove Creek, Sydney Basin apparent regional variations in the timing of different events, particularly if researchers in different regions are not using the same methods. Future discussions, unless indicated, are based on millennial sequences. Artefact accumulation rates in individual habitations Comparison of the trends in individual habitations shows that the artefact accumulation rates in each varied widely in timing, direction and magnitude (Fig. 6.6 and Table 6.13); they also often differed from those of the local artefact accumulation rates (Fig. 6.7). At the seven habitations used for more than 3000 years, the following patterns can be seen:  1. a dramatic or substantial increase in the artefact accumulation rates within the last 3000 years, but usually within the third or second millennium BP. The magnitude of the increase varied from habitation to habitation; 2. at only one of these seven habitations (Loggers) (14% of the habitations) did the artefact accumulation rates continue to increase gradually throughout the depth of the deposit, and the highest artefact accumulation rate occurred in the first millennium BP; 3. at the other six habitations (86% of habitations), a decrease in the artefact accumulation rates is apparent in the first or second millennium BP, and the peak in the artefact accumulation rates occurred sometime within the third and second millennium BP. The magnitude of the decrease varied from habitation to habitation; in most it was substantial but in others (e.g., Uprooted Tree) it was minor in nature. These differences indicate that the history of use and/or at least the amount of stone knapping at each habitation varied over time. The inter-site variability in this index further confirms the often-made statement that regional or local prehistories should not be based on the sequence of evidence from ‘single sites’ (e.g., Struever 1971; Thomas 1979: 283; Attenbrow 1981: 119; Davidson 1983: 94–5; Cosgrove 1995: 108–9). Inter-zonal variability within the catchment Inter-zonal variability is seen in the habitation establishment rates, the numbers of habitations used and the artefact accumulation rates. In the 12th millennium BP, habitations were established initially in only one zone, the main valley bottoms. In the ninth millennium BP, a second zone (the periphery ridgetops) was used, and then in the seventh millennium BP a third zone (the subsidiary ridgesides; that is, if it was not inhabited in the 10th millennium BP). It was not until the second millennium BP that habitations were established in another two zones and only in the first millennium BP that all zones were used.  In each zone, the habitation establishment rate and the number of habitations used in each millennium increased over time. However, the timing, direction and magnitude of the changes in the artefact accumulation rates were not the same in each zone. In the first three zones inhabited (main valley bottoms, periphery ridgetops and subsidiary ridgesides), the accumulation rates increased until the second millennium BP — then in the first millennium BP the rates decreased, but at varying magnitudes. In contrast, the two zones which were not inhabited until the second millennium BP had increased accumulation rates in the first millennium BP. Thus, habitations were not established in all topographic zones at the same time, and three of the zones were used only within the last 2000 years. This pattern suggests there was a greater dispersal of activities within the catchment over time. It also appears visually, when mapped (Figs 6.3 and 6.4), to be simply a denser or more concentrated habitation pattern, particularly in the last 2000 years, which is due partially to the distribution of the last-used zones (main ridgesides, peninsula ridgetops, and subsidiary valley bottoms). Establishment of habitations in these three zones could be viewed as ‘movement into marginal areas’ or ‘an terra australis 21 146 </page> <page sequence="33">                              Temporal distribution: quantitative changes in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment intensification of land-use’ as proposed by Lourandos (see Chapter 2). If so, it is on a much smaller scale than the examples given by Lourandos, but this presumably would not preclude it from being part of the same process. As with the individual habitations, each zone appears to have had its own history of use (Tables 6.15 and 6.16). Variations over time in the millennial growth rates  Growth rates for the habitation and artefact indices reinforce the trends and complexity outlined above (Table 6.6). In the three indices there are some consecutive millennia in which growth rates were constant, but as a general rule they fluctuated quite markedly over the 11,000-year period and varied dramatically between some periods of time. The growth rates for the habitation establishment rates varied from zero (×1) to ×3.5 and for the number of habitations used from zero (×1) to ×1.81. The highest growth rates were in the artefact accumulation rates — they varied from ×0.23 to ×14.39 — where there were decreases as well as increases. Because of the larger numbers of sites and artefacts in the more recent millennia, the quantitative changes that occurred in the habitation and artefact indices are usually numerically much larger than those that occurred earlier (i.e., pre-4000 BP). However, the growth rates associated with these larger increases and decreases in recent millennia are not always greater than the growth rates of early-Holocene levels. The highest growth rates in the local artefact accumulation rates are recorded in the 10th and third millennia BP. Substantial declines in the growth rates occurred in the eighth and first millennia BP. These variations in growth rates are pertinent to later discussions concerning interpretations which are based on the assumption that increases in numbers of habitations and/or artefacts are the product or material manifestation of increases in numbers of people — either general or local population increase, or increased use of a particular habitation. Relationship between the timing of the quantitative changes and the appearance of qualitative changes in the stone artefact assemblages The quantitative changes over time (i.e., in numbers of sites and artefacts) have been explained in terms of the qualitative changes in the stone artefact assemblages, that is, by changes in typology, technology and raw material (Chapter 2). In the catchment, however, the timing of the quantitative changes did not coincide with the appearance of new artefact types and technological features or with changes in raw materials, for example:  1. backed artefacts appeared long before the dramatic increases in both the artefact accumulation rates at individual habitations in the third or second millennium BP and the local artefact accumulation rate in the third millennium BP; 2. the disappearance of Bondi points and decrease in other backed artefacts occurred about 1600 BP (i.e., in the second millennium BP), whereas at most habitations the decrease in the artefact accumulation rates occurred in the first millennium BP. This ‘typological’ change thus occurred earlier than the dramatic decrease in the artefact accumulation rates; and, 3. bipolar artefacts increase markedly in frequency percentage about 2800 BP; this ‘typological’ change is related to an increase in bipolar working (a ‘technological’ change), which is also correlated with an increase in the percentage frequency of quartz (a ‘raw material’ change). Bipolar working is seen on quartz material more often than on other types of raw material, such as silcrete and chert/tuff, and increases relative to hand-held percussion. The predominance of quartz over FGS which occurred ca 2800 BP was used as the criterion for the beginning of Phase 3 (see Chapter 3, Temporal sequences). The dramatic increase in the local artefact accumulation rate in terra australis 21 147 </page> <page sequence="34">      What’s changing: population size or land-use patterns? The archaeology of Upper Mangrove Creek, Sydney Basin the third millennium BP appears to coincide with the beginning of Phase 3 (ca 2800 BP). The dramatic changes in the artefact accumulation rates, however, are unlikely to be caused directly by the increased use of quartz and/or bipolar working, for the following reasons:  (a) a dramatic increase in the artefact accumulation rates does not necessarily occur in the same level in which quartz dominates over FGS in individual archaeological deposits — that is, the two events did not occur at the same time (see also Attenbrow 1981, 1982a; Stern 1982);  (b) the increase in percentage frequency of quartz artefacts at individual habitations indicates that the change in dominance from FGS to quartz was a gradual one, beginning about 5000 or 4000 BP and continuing until contact with some minor oscillations (e.g., Loggers, Attenbrow 1981: Fig. 6.13; Deep Creek, Stern 1982: Graph 3);  (c) artefact accumulation rates did not always increase over time in all archaeological deposits. An increase in the percentage frequency of quartz did not always occur in all archaeological deposits, but there is no correlation between those archaeological deposits in which increased artefact accumulation rates occurred and those in which the percentage frequency of quartz increased, and vice versa.  Concluding comments The evidence presented above indicates that habitation patterns in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment varied over time, as did the accumulation of artefacts in individual habitations. The relationships between the late-Holocene dramatic changes in the habitation and artefact indices are not obvious and are likely to have been complex. Subsistence and land-use patterns associated with the changing habitation distribution patterns and changing artefact accumulation rates were probably equally complex.  Grinding areas and images are also indicators of land-use and their creation would have varied over time as well, though identifying quantitative changes over time in their creation and the use of locations with these traits is much more difficult than is the case with archaeological deposits. The only evidence that suggests a date for pigment images in the catchment comes from outside the random sampling units. At Dingo and Horned Anthropomorph, polished dark-red ochre of similar colour to images on the walls was found in the deposits of the southern shelter below an excavated context dated to ca 580 BP (581±120 BP, GX-0070; Macintosh 1965: 85, 96–7). In the immediately adjacent northern shelter of this site, charcoal directly above a layer with ochre of a light-red colour similar to line drawings on the walls of that shelter was dated to between 144±125 BP and 120±155 BP (GX-0069). Macintosh considered that these dates indicated the northern images were created between AD 1750 and AD 1830, and the southern images ca AD 1400. In the random sampling units, a broken ochred palette was found in Sunny Shelter in levels with an estimated date of 1400–1600 BP (Fig. 3.18, see Chapter 3). In addition, outside the random sampling units, a piece of utilised ochre, dark-red haematite-rich material, was found in Deep Creek Shelter in a level dated to ca 2000 years ago (Attenbrow 1982a: 19–20, 27). However, pigment images were not seen on the walls or ceilings of either of these shelters. After his study of the rates of weathering and roof-fall in NSW south coast rockshelters, Hughes (1978: 41) stated, ‘decorated surfaces in shelters not used as habitations, especially engravings, might well have survived for hundreds or thousands of years.’ However, he concluded that ‘it is unlikely that painting and drawings in such occupied shelters would have survived more than a few decades and even rock engravings would probably have been terra australis 21 148 </page> <page sequence="35">    Temporal distribution: quantitative changes in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment completely removed within a few hundred years’. It is possible that pigment images once existed in Deep Creek and Sunny Shelters, but the surfaces are presently irregular and not favourable for creating pigment images. It is also possible the ochre used in these shelters was used for decorating tools, weapons or people’s bodies.  Some information about the grinding grooves, which are assumed to be associated with making and maintaining ground-edged implements, can be obtained from the catchment’s archaeological deposits. Ground-edged implements (e.g., axes/hatchets) and fragments from them occur in the deposits only in levels dating to the last 4000 years, and, increasingly, the last 2000 years (Appendix 1). Stone types used to manufacture ground-edged implements occur increasingly in levels dating to the last 4000 years; grinding grooves are thus assumed to have been made in the catchment some time within the last 4000 years, and principally in the last 2000 years. The introduction of ground-edged implements into south-eastern Australia some 4000 years ago, and the subsequent increase in their manufacture, would have brought about changes in land-use patterns in the catchment since:  1. the raw materials from which they were made (usually an igneous or an indurated metamorphic rock) differed from that used to make flaked stone implements; and, 2. areas of suitable sandstone (i.e., uniform and coarse-grained) were required to shape and/or sharpen the axe/hatchet heads.  Basalt sources, the rock from which many of the ground implements in the catchment were made (pers. obs.), are not present within the catchment, but exist within a short distance (&lt;10km) to the west (Mogo Creek) and to the south (e.g., Basalt Hill, Kulnura Hymix quarries and Popran Creek), as well as elsewhere in the region. The nearby outcrops may not be the specific sources of basalt used for the catchment implements since the surface exposures were probably deeply weathered (as at the unquarried Basalt Hill). However, basalt pebbles of useable size and quality occur in creeks below these sources (Mogo, Warre Warren and Popran Creeks respectively) (local residents Lionel Young and Robert Thompson [pers. comm.] and pers. obs.). The need for this type of raw material and the restricted locations in which it occurs are likely to have influenced or altered the movements of people as well as trading patterns and networks. Grinding grooves in the catchment have a more restricted distribution pattern than other archaeological traits. They occur on sandstone, in particular, the Hawkesbury sandstone, which is more uniform and coarser-grained than the Narrabeen Group of sandstones, though exposed surfaces of the latter are sometimes suitable. In the catchment, the Hawkesbury sandstone is restricted to the ridgetops and upper ridgesides. Whether the introduction of ground-edged implements and their manufacture initiated use of different (previously unused) topographic zones is not clear. However, it would have meant increased use of certain areas and an increase in the range of activities undertaken in areas which previously may only have been used for, say, hunting and gathering food resources. Many eastern Australian studies in the 1970s and 1980s documented dramatic or substantial increases in the late-Holocene in the number of habitations used and the number of artefacts accumulated over time (see Chapter 2). The catchment data similarly indicate a continuing increase in the number of habitations established and used, but the artefact accumulation rates in many individual habitations and in the catchment as a whole did not continue to increase, and there was a dramatic decrease in the first millennium BP. Such decreases were rarely acknowledged in the 1970s and 1980s, but they are, however, common in many other regions and localities in eastern Australia, as will be seen in the following chapter and as has been shown in more recent studies.  terra australis 21 149 </page> <page sequence="36">  </page> </plain_text>
