<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOYNBEE'S SEARCH FOR HISTORICAL LAWS WILLIAM DRAY In writing A Study of History, Toynbee tells us, it was his purpose "to try out the scientific approach to human affairs and to test how far it will carry us".' It seems clear enough, from what he says at countless points in his ten-volume comparison of civilizations that he believes it has carried him, at any rate, as far as the discovery of a number of historical laws. It is true that, especially in the first six volumes, Toynbee is on the whole rather cautious in stating the results of his enquiry. At times, for example, he prefers to speak of "patterns", "recurrences", or "regularities"; and when the word "law" is used, it is often, although not always, put in parentheses, while the statement to which it refers contains some qualification like "is apt to". It is true, too, that the publication of Toynbee's final four volumes has made it abundantly clear, if it was not so already, that the search for laws is not the only concern of the author of A Study of History. And perhaps it could even be claimed that his interest in this aspect of his enterprise has progressively declined. Yet in a long section of the ninth volume entitled "Law and Freedom in History", Toynbee has thought it worth while to attempt both methodological and philosophical justification of his search for laws; and his discussions of the contacts between civilizations in space and time in volumes VII and VIII contain some of the most unequivocal claims to the discovery of laws to be found in the whole work. As for the way he hedges in formulating some of them, it would be natural to regard this as no more than an expre sion of a real or affected modesty. For as he says himself, his Study is a pioneering work which his successors will doubtless have to modify in many details. In the two and a half decades since Toynbee's Study began to appear it has received criticism of a number of kinds. The hard core of that criticism, how- ever, has generally been that in one way or another the claim of "scientific" status for his conclusions is bogus, and perhaps irretrievably so. Such criticism has run the gamut from the sad reflection of Sir Ernest Barker that "Toynbee's 1 "What I am Trying to Do," in Toynbee and History. Critical Essays and Reviews, ed. F. M.

Crossman that his "Teutonic pretensions to scientific method are merely a stucco front to a Gothic catacomb of myth and legend".3 The most sympathetic reader would probably be hard put to deny that Toynbee's work - in its intuitive leaps, its disdain of system, its literary looseness of phrase, its evocative and persuasive style - leaves itself open to charges of this kind. But it is impor- tant that, in criticizing it, we should distinguish carefully between questions of faulty execution and questions of faulty principle - especially if the work is to be used as a basis for further enquiry. In this paper I propose to discuss three sorts of difficulties of principle which may seem to arise out of the way Toynbee conducts his search for historical laws. The first concerns the adequacy of his empirical procedure - I shall ask whether his claim to offer empirical verification is sound. The second concerns his concept of empirical law - I shall ask whether, in his customary usage, it is univocal and clear. The third concerns his theory of human action - I shall ask whether his interpretation of socially significant actions as responses to "challenges" is compatible with the assertion of historical laws at all. In no case shall I deny that what Toynbee says raises difficulties. But it does not seem to me that these difficulties are quite as catastrophic as his critics have usually represented them to be. The claim that Toynbee's Study arrives at its conclusions by an empirical method is firmly, even ostentatiously, stated. We are assured at frequent intervals that the author is using his "customary empirical method", his "well- tried empirical method", and even his "trusty and well-beloved method of making an empirical survey"; the enquiry is to show us what can be done by English empiricism, where German a priorism had "drawn blank".4 Yet it has often been denied that Toynbee's procedure deserves the name "empirical" at all. For what he really does, it may be alleged, is note, first, the pattern of development in that civilization with which he is most familiar, the Hellenic, and then impose this pattern upon the course of events in every other civilization he considers. In any case, it may be added, the historical laws which are eventually formulated would, at most, be generalizations from a very few cases - some twenty-odd in number. And this scarcely seems a sufficient basis for a claim to have discovered laws holding for the species "civilization". 9 "Dr. Toynbee's Study of History," in Essays, 92.

He began, he says, with a com- parison of Hellenic and Western societies, achieving thereby what he calls a "binocular" view of history, before passing to a search for parallels in other cases, still using the Hellenic civilizations as "a standard of comparison" (X, 95; V, 58). And in view of the barrage of criticism that he has provoked, both on points of fact and on points of interpretation, from scholars who may be considered authorities on some of the less familiar civilizations, it seems reason- able to conclude that Toynbee did not escape the hazards of his admitted procedure.5 Yet we must be wary of seeming to imply that there is anything wrong in principle with that procedure. For the practice of measuring new cases against an old one, taken as a standard, is simply a version of what might be called the method of "hypothesis". The fact that the hypothesis being tested was itself derived from a prior actual case does not affect the tenability of the general conclusions drawn, provided that the case is indeed used as a "standard of comparison" and not as a Procrustean Bed. Thus if Toynbee has in fact fallen prey to the temptation to exaggerate the similarities between develop- ments in the Hellenic and other civilizations, although this may in one sense be a methodological failure on his part, it is not one which is attributable to a faulty concept of method. And his errors, if any, are correctable by the more careful employment of the same method. Perhaps a conventional historian would want to argue - characteristically - against even this apparently innocuous conclusion. For he might insist that in directing the enquirer's attention toward similarities between civilizations, Toynbee's method not only encourages him, but positively requires him, to ignore the tremendous differences between them. Thus even if properly applied, the method would necessarily lead to a falsification of history. To this com- plaint Toynbee himself has given what seems to me a satisfactory answer. In tatempting a "morphology" of civilizations, he says, his aim is "to sort out their common experiences, which are specific, from their unique experiences, which are individual";" his conclusions will thus in no way deny the uniqueness of historical events.7 The purpose of his enquiry is to find whatever similarities there are; a claim to have discovered some would imply no denial of those differences which may be of legitimate interest to historians of particular civilizations. If Toynbee can find certain similarities of structure in spite of differences, then he has taken an important step toward the discovery of his- torical laws. What he leaves out is simply outside the announced concern, not of history, but of a certain kind of "study" of history. I For examples of both kinds of criticism of what Toynbee says even about familiar civiliza- tions, see P. Geyl, Debates with Historians (New York, 1958), chs. V-VIII; and articles by H. Trevor-Roper and P. Sorokin, in Essays, 122-4; 167-171. 6 C.T., 160. 7 See also I, 178.</page><page sequence="4">TOYNBEE S SEARCH FOR HISTORICAL LAWS 35 Even if this contention is accepted, of course, it may still be felt that Toynbee's claim to ground his laws empirically comes to grief on the objection that the most scrupulous enquiry cannot hope to elicit anything worth calling empirical laws from a mere twenty-odd cases. And Toynbee himself seems somewhat uneasy about this. At a number of points, for example, he reminds us that the history of civilizations has scarcely as yet begun; indeed, at one point he cal- culates roughly that during the likely span of human life of this planet, some 1,743 million civilizations might conceivably run their courses - a speculation which suggests that he regarded his Study as unfortunately, but unavoidably, generalizing from a ludicrously small "sample".8 His sensitivity to this sort of objection also reveals itself, rather peculiarly, in his confession that he was "elated" to read, in a book by Sir Charles Darwin, that "in most matters con- cerned with probability, three or four count as small numbers, ten as a fairly large number, and a hundred as a very large number" (IX, 206n). For he had spent "twenty-five years of his working life on mental operations with twenty- one specimens of the species 'civilizations' without having any assurance that this number was, in truth, large enough". It seems to me that the problem of inductive justification in Toynbee's Study is far from being as desperate as this sort of reflection represents it to be. For there is a feature of his actual practice, when arguing for the truth of a law, which makes it quite misleading to say that he generalizes, straight off, from a mere twenty-odd cases. For the pattern of development which his analysis elicits is not just in fact found to be present in case after case; in almost every instance Toynbee tries to provide an explanation for the currency of the recur- ring patterns he discovers; there is constant reference to what we may expect the protagonists to do and achieve in the circumstances obtaining at various stages of the growth and decline of a civilization. This feature of Toynbee's method is found, for example, in the way he supports his contention that "the stimulating effect of breaking new ground is greatest of ail when the new ground can only be reached by crossing the sea" (II, 86-8, 93). Having enunciated his law, he goes on to support it by citing examples. But then he leaves the plane of simple induction altogether with the claim that his cases have distinctive characteristics in common which have "an inner connection". "The distinctive- ness of these phenomena and their inner connections", he continues, "are both explained by one and the same simple fact: In transmarine migration, the social apparatus of the migrants has to be packed on board ship before they can leave the shores of the old country and then unpacked again at the end of the voyage before they can make themselves at home on the new ground." Again, when discussing renaissances, Toynbee illustrates, with cases, his claim that "the order in which a living society evokes ghosts out of the past life of a dead prey ;I, 463; see also P. Geyl, P. Sorokin, and A. J. Toynbee, The Pattern of the Past (Boston, 1949), 84-5.</page><page sequence="5">36 WILLIAM DRAY decessor" seems to be "the inverse of the historical order" (IX, 128-9). But he does not rest content with mere lystating this as an inductively ascertained truth; he immediately goes on to ask how we are to account for this correlation, which "does not appear to serve any useful purpose in itself, and is certainly not deliberately intended". "The explanation", he suggests, "is perhaps to be found in the consideration that the living party to the encounter is apt to be still in process of growth during the time when it is making its successive renaissances of divers elements. ... The last phase of its disintegration, in which it will have entered into 'a second childhood', will be the phase which will display the closest affinity with the infantile first phase of the living society's growth". Toynbee then reinforces the relevance of this reflection by citing a law of more general application: that we cannot use what we are not spiritually prepared for.9 Now it cannot be denied that the additional considerations which Toynbee in such cases adduces to strengthen his assertion of historical laws vary widely in the extent to which they in fact perform this function; and in some cases they do not perform it at all. Toynbee has been accused, for example, of at- tempting to support his conclusions by directing his readers' attention to myths; and although the extent to which he does this can easily be exaggerated, he does from time to time seem to provide some justification for such a criticism. Thus, in introducing his concept of "challenge and response", having discussed the cases of Faust and Job, he declares: "By the light of Mythology, we have gained some insight into the nature of challenges and responses." (I, 299). A sympathetic critic might perhaps argue that Toynbee's claim here is simply to have explicated the concept, which he will then test for applicability to various historical situations. But such an interpretation becomes more difficult to maintain in the light of Toynbee's added assertion: "We have come to see that creation is the outcome of an encounter" - as if this were an empirical discovery arising out of the purely mythological considerations presented up to this point.10 A similar complaint often appears warranted by the use which Toynbee makes of analogies from other fields. For he treats them sometimes, not just as vivid ways of talking about his subject matter, but as if they actually lent inductive strength to his conclusions. Thus in discussing the possibility of laws 9 For other examples see Toynbee's explanation of universal states favouring the growth of new religions (VII, 228-9); the codification of law during the disintegration phase of civiliza- tions (VII, 279); the tendency of new ground to be socially fertile (IV, 296-7); the association of geographical expansion with social disintegration (III, 160; V, 200). In other cases, where Toynbee cannot explain a law, such as the occurrence of a war and peace cycle with a standard "wavelength" during a Time of Troubles, he suggests that an explanation ought to be forth- coming - in this case, of the kind he-gives for the three-generation "wavelength" of social assi- milation (IX, 326). 10 For a similar apparent misuse of mythology see Toynbee's reference to "the myth of the Expulsion from Eden" as testimony to the stimulating effects of "new ground" (II, 73). But he then promises that we shall "find these intuitions confirmed by the evidence of empirical observations" (my italics).</page><page sequence="6">TOYNBEE S SEARCH FOR HISTORICAL LAWS 37 governing the operation of a political balance of power - which will themselves be used to help explain certain inductively discovered cycles of warfare which occur during the disintegration phase of civilizations - Toynbee declares that "the instability of the equilibrium varies in inverse ratio to the number of its points d'appui","1 meaning in this case the number of contending states. But at least part of his confidence in this generalization seems to be derived from his experience with three-legged and four-legged stools. Elsewhere he seems to imply that the impossibility of "reconstituting" eggs which have once been broken for an omelette has some bearing upon the acceptability of his claim that a civilization which has passed through a "Time of Troubles" faces "insurmountable" obstacles to "recuperation" (IX, 343). In most cases, however, the additional considerations cited in explaining the currency of a law are derived from conclusions which Toynbee claims to have established at other points in the work, from the general historical knowledge we have before we begin operations at the level of the Study at all, or from the commonsense knowledge of human nature which is usually presumed to be the stock in trade of conventional historians - not to mention the "wisdom of the ages" enshrined in such dicta as "It is through suffering that learning comes", or "The most likely way to reach a goal is to be aiming ... at some more ambitious goal beyond it."'2 No doubt these materials are often used uncri- tically; and it may be objected that some of Toynbee's explanatory laws are simply untrue. Even if true, of course, it could be questioned whether, in particular cases, they afford his historical laws sufficient support - and it seems to me doubtful that they do. Critics might also object to an assumption behind their explanatory use that there are some basic laws of human nature or human behaviour which hold at all times and places: an assumption implicit in Toyn- bee's whole doctrine of the "philosophical contemporaneity of civilizations". /hat we cannot properly do, it seems to me, is repudiate those laws without further examination on the ground that they represent simple induction from a handful of cases. For in typical cases there is a complicated additional tissue of support. It is very often, and with considerable justification, urged against Toynbee that his work shows insufficient awareness of the importance of looking for negative instances of the laws he wishes to establish. And it must be admitted, IX, 236. In this connection it may be noticed that Toynbee occasionally tries to impress his readers by expressing a law in pseudo-quantitative terms. For example: "An integral culture ray, like an integral light ray, is diffracted into a spectrum of its component elements in the course of penetrating a recalcitrant object - the degree of this diffraction being proportionate to the degree of the resistance that is encountered" (VIII, 7); and again: "On a stationary military frontier between a civilization and a barbarism,. . . the barbarians' advantage in- creases... in geometrical progression at each arithmetical addition to the length of line which the defenders of the civilization have to hold" (II, 283). In the second example Toynbee has the grace to concede that he uses a "mathematical metaphor". "I CT., 234; VII, 388, 510, 546.</page><page sequence="7">38 WILLIAM DRAY too, that when he does find such instances he very often appears to treat them rather high-handedly. Thus after conceding that there are "civilizations created by the unaided endeavours of a single race", he goes on to assure us that the number is so small that we can treat them "as exceptions to a prevalent law - a law to the effect that the geneses of civilizations require creative contributions from more races than one" (I, 240). This bland assurance comes rather strangely from a theorist who has just triumphantly refuted a rival law - that civilizations originate in an infusion of blood from certain races, which for this reason may be judged superior - by citing negative instances. It is of interest to note, however, that it is not Toynbee's usual practice simply to admit exceptions to his laws. Indeed, he generally makes the same sort of attempt at explaining exceptions as we have seen him make in discussing the laws them- selves. Thus "abortive" and "arrested" civilizations are not just exceptions to a normal pattern of development; they are members of classes of exceptions accounted for by the special nature of the challenge to which they responded or attempted to respond. This feature of Toynbee's practice would provide him with at least the beginning of an answer to critics who complain that, quite apart from his having far too few cases to warrant generalization, the laws he states do not even hold for all of the few cases he has. It is an oddity - although ultimately perhaps no more than a verbal one - of Toynbee's treatment of explained exceptions to refer to them sometimes as "proving the rule". Thus, after enunciating, tentatively at least, the general law that a disintegrating civilization which becomes "petrified" enjoys only a "'life-in-death", Toynbee refers to the religious reforms of Ikhnaton, in the Egyptiac civilization of the 14th century B.C., as ""the exception that proved the rule" (V, 3n); and a similar conclusion is reached regarding the triumphs of the Napoleonic Code, despite a "rule" which is said to be "'inherent in the very nature of the declines and falls of civilizations": that codification fails ""to arrest decay" (VII, 271-2, 278-9). Upon examination, however, it becomes clear that for Toynbee his explanation shows that such cases are apparent exceptions only. For as he describes it, Ikhnaton's isolated "act of creation" was "abortive"; it failed ""to awaken the dead".1 And ""the Code Napoleon was the work of empire builders to whom History ... had assigned the peculiar task of providing a universal state for a moribund sub-society within a larger body social that had not yet lost its vitality". So in virtue of its "double-life", in both Western Society and the sub-society of the medieval city state cosmos, the Code was able to enjoy a "brilliant career" without falsifying Toynbee's contention that "the demand for codification reaches its climax in the penulti- mate age before a social catastrophe, long after the peak of achievement in jurisprudence has been passed". In other cases the exceptions are not just apparent; yet Toynbee's point in 13 I, 145. In another case (V, 325) such an exception is called "apparent".</page><page sequence="8">TOYNBEE S SEARCH FOR HISTORICAL LAWS 39 claiming that they prove a rule can usually be understood. Thus, after des- cribing the Nomad "policy of treating conquered sedentary populations as human sheep"', and observing that "the lives of such Nomad empires on cul- tivated ground had ... usually been short", Toynbee declares that "the relative longevity of the Ottoman empire is the exception that proves this rule" (VIII, 542). But the reason for this was the "rare vision and skill" of these "shepherd- kings", together with the fact that their victims had previously been in such a desperate state of anarchy they were willing to pay any price for peace - both being contrary to the conditions which were originally assumed to explain the currency of the "broken" law. A similar point lies behind Toynbee's claim that "the survival of the English Common Law" was an exception to the rule that the law of a disintegrating universal state is gradually infused into the customary law of its barbarian successors.'4 For in England no sizable groups of the Ro- man population remained to carry on its own legal traditions, as occurred elsewhere. In both cases, the exceptions do not prove the rule as stated; but it might be said thay they prove it as intended.'5 They bring out assumptions made in formulating the original rule, which helps us to see both the basis on which it was asserted and the limits of its applicability. II So far I have argued that, whether or not Toynbee succeeds in specific instances in providing empirical verification for his laws, there are features of his verifica- tory procedure which make it a good deal more promising than many of his critics have been willing to allow. I now want to consider a more embarrassing sort of methodological objection: the claim, not that Toynbee overestimates the extent to which he provides empirical verification for his laws, but rather that his whole verificatory enterprise is undermined by the unclarity of his conception of what he is trying to verify. Indeed, his whole conceptual appa- ratus, it has sometimes been alleged, is so vague, so ill-thought out, so question- begging, that it is quite impossible to assess the meaning, let alone the force, of his conclusions. And this general obscurity may seem to extend to the con- 4 VII, 284-6. For other such examples see V, 354-9; V, 28-29. 15 In view of the parade of classical learning in Toynbee's Study, it may perhaps be suspected that by "prove", Toynbee may mean only what can be directly derived from the Latin word probare, i.e., "to test" or "to make a trial of" rather than "to establish" - which would remove the contradiction from any assertion that an example could prove a contrary rule. But Toynbee's speaking in similar contexts of exceptions which "do not discredit a rule but rather confirm it" (V, 358), would seem to dispose of any such interpretation of his meaning. It must be admitted, however, that the interpretation suggested in this paper will not, in every case, rescue Toynbee from what looks like rather slip-shod thinking about exceptions. At times, for example - see D. C. Somervell, A Study of History. Abridgement (Oxford, 1946), I, 427 - he seems content merely to note them, while continuing to assert the law. And unexplained, as well as explained, exceptions are occasionally said to prove rules (see C.T., 188).</page><page sequence="9">40 WILLIAM DRAY cept of "empirical law" itself. I shall consider separately three kinds of diffi- culties into which Toynbee, in this connection, may possibly be thought to fall: the confusion of assertions of laws with assertions of particular facts; the obscuring of a law's empirical meaning by formulating it in value-charged language; and the reduction of its empirical content to the vanishing point by interpreting it as a logical truism or tautology. In a well-known discussion of the function of general laws in history, Pro- fessor Carl Hempel has defined "empirical law" as what is expressed by "a statement of universal conditional form which is capable of being confirmed or disconfirmed by suitable empirical findings".'6 Our first difficulty is exem- plified by an unfortunate tendency of Toynbee to designate as "laws" certain statements which, although in one sense generalizations, are not universal ones. And by this I do not mean generalizations which do not always apply, i.e., which have exceptions or classes of exceptions; I mean generalizations which are not universal in form. Thus, in discussing the system of the Osmanlis, Toynbee observes: "the lives of such Nomad empires on cultivated ground had ... usually been short" (VII, 542); in warning of the dangers of nationalism, he declares: "fratricidal war of ever-increasing violence between parochial sovereign states had been by far the commonest cause of mortality among civilizations" (IX, 442); and in examining the essential institutions of universal states, he argues for "a general rule that the written word had been an indis- pensable instrument of ecumenical government" (VII, 239). Such general- izations might be called "enumerative" or "summative": they collect a large number of similar cases - all of them presumably examined - but they do not warrant inferences to unexamined cases beyond them. They could be accepted with good conscience by historians entirely out of sympathy with the project of searching for laws in history, because they are not, in the ordinary sense, laws or rules at all; they are statements of particular fact. Yet the problem posed by such generalizations for the interpretation of Toynbee's results is hardly a crucial one. For summative generalizations usually appear in Toyn- bee's Study in conjunction with corresponding universal generalizations, part of the evidence for which they often summarize. And in other cases, the context of discussion - e.g., the enquiry into the essential characteristics of a universal state - suggests that the summative formulation is no more than a (perhaps reprehensible) "hedge" against a charge of hasty generalization. To refer to such statements as laws or rules is doubtless to be guilty of carelessness of terminology. But when we take the whole context of Toynbee's argument into account, it seems clear enough that what he claims to discover is laws which are universal in form. Another way in which Toynbee may conceivably be taken to confuse law 16 "The Function of General Laws in History," in Readings in Philosophical Analysis, ed. H. FeigI and W. Sellars (New York, 1949), 459.</page><page sequence="10">TOYNBEE S SEARCH FOR HISTORICAL LAWS 41 with fact is the one drawn to the attention of theorists of history by Professor Karl Popper in The Poverty of Historicism.17 Popper argues, persuasively, that speculative philosophers of history, in seeking what they may call a "law of the historical process as a whole", have confused statements of law, which are universal and conditional in form, with statements of existing trends, which are particular and existential. A so-called "law of progress" in history is thus an unsuccessful logical hybrid; it represents an attempt to capture, for the question- able practice of predicting the future on the basis of an observed past trend, the legitimacy of a prediction from antecedent facts in accordance with universal conditional laws which apply to them. If Toynbee, in re-emphasizing a linear pattern in history in his final volumes - in this case a pattern of increasing religious insight - had referred to the assertion of such a pattern as a "law", he would in Popper's sense have been guilty of confusing law with fact.'8 But in so far as spiritual progress is a "law" of history for Toynbee, it seems to be so only in the sense that it is the will of God; it is a "Law of God" (and a "Hope of Toynbee"), not a "Law of Nature". If Toynbee mentions a linear "Law of Progress" at all, it is only to criticize it as a mistake of the Enlightenment (although admittedly he does not criticize it on the present ground). Toynbee's closest approach to the assertion of laws of the factual, linear sort is to be found in an extravagant, highly metamorphical and quite uncharacteristic passage in which he describes the frustration by "History " of a "nisus" toward political unity in North America.19 But although one of his reviewers represents Toyn- bee as asserting a historical law at this point - the "law" that North America was not to be united under a single political authority - Toynbee himself does not use the term; and if a law is at issue in that discussion at all it would seem to be rather the conditional generalization that rhythmic fluctuations are generatedd by a struggle between two tendencies of unequal strength". What- ever may be our opinion of the empirical content of that particular candidate, it would appear at any rate to be innocent of the confusion of the law with existing, factual trand. And this can be said also of Toynbee's ordinary employ- ment of the concept. If we turn to the second difficulty, we shall find it exemplified in the presence of overtly evaluative terms in many of the statements which Toynbee does regard as formulating laws. Thus the histories of the four higher religions, he tells us, reveal that "spiritual achievement and material achievement are 17 (London, 1957), 105-8. 18 This is not to say that he would have necessarily been in error if he had extrapolated the trend, and asserted it to hold for the future, provided that his assertion was based upon his confidence that he had explained the trend by reference to a set of initial conditions and the currency of certain universal historical laws. That Toynbee may, at times, have intended to assert such a trend is suggested by his figure of the chariot of Religion moving forward by reason of the revolutions of the wheels of civilizations (VII, 444; IX, 296). This point is dis- cussed further in Section III. 19 IX, 287, 297-9. See A. J. P. Taylor, "Much Learing. .," in Essays, 116.</page><page sequence="11">42 WILLIAM DRAY antithetical" (VII, 701); the survey of contacts between contemporary civiliza- tions shows that "the only fruitful results of these encounters are the works of peace" (VIII, 451); the study of cultural radiation on the borders of a declining civilization supports the conclusion that "the carrying-power of a culture-ele- ment is in inverse ratio to its spiritual value" (VIII, 516). To many sober- minded empiricists, such value-charged laws will present difficulties; for they will seem to fall short of the requirement, not that empirical laws be universal and conditional in form, but that they be capable of being confirmed or dis- confirmed by "empirical" findings. Can we accept as an empirical law a state- ment which licenses a prediction of "spiritual achievement"? Would not such a law, used in an explanatory way, yield only "pseudo-explanation"?20 It is clear, at least, that such laws cannot be either used or tested by anyone unable or unwilling to make the relevant evaluation. Their acceptance as historical laws would therefore not be consistent with a very popular slogan of social theorists: that values enter into their study only as facts - i.e., as the reported values of the agents whose actions are being studied. For what such laws would in appropriate circumstances license us to predict would be events to which a certain evaluation, rather than just a certain description, would apply. Predictions would not be just that a certain sort of event would occur; they would be that what will occur (and there may be a wide range of possibili- ties) will be valuable in a certain way. Since the present writer doubts that historical and social enquiry, in any case, can procede very far without such evaluation by the enquirer, it would seem to him that what Toynbee does overtly here, and often in somewhat purple language, will probably be done covertly in the formulation of most social laws. But even if this is a mistake, it is difficult to see what could be logically wrong with the assertion of such value-charged laws on inductive grounds by anyone willing to make the neces- sary evaluations. Perhaps belief in the possibility of discovering such laws would require drastic metaphysical adjustment on the part of many who now say they believe in "scientific method". And perhaps the strictest inductive procedure in the comparative study of, say, spiritual achievements, could not be called "scientific" without distorting a generally accepted meaning of the term; for even after agreement had been reached regarding the description of a test instance, the possibility of evaluative difference between enquirers would, of course, remain. Even a subjectivist in ethics, however, by an empathetic "tour de force", might discover the inductive content of Toynbee's laws by studying first their author's values. And if he objected that such laws, if he verified them, would not tell him anything he really wanted to know, this would scarcely make a methodological point against Toynbee. It would be an objec- tion to the questions Toynbee insists on asking, rather than the methods he employs in trying to answer them. 'I Hempel's term for an explanation employing a non-empirical concept. Op. cit., 468.</page><page sequence="12">TOYNBEE'S SEARCH FOR HISTORICAL LAWS 43 The third difficulty which we have to consider is a good deal more trouble- some. It is the claim that Toynbee is so little aware of the difference between logical truisms and general empirical statements that at least some of his so- called laws are just empty tautologies. Tautologies, of course, have their own legitimate use. Toynbee may perhaps be interpreted as so using one when he tells us: "At the genesis of every 'related' civilization, a challenge from the human environment is given and taken ex hypothesi. This challenge is implicit in the relation itself, which begins with a differentiation and culminates in a secession" (1, 336). In this case, the function of the generalization is to clarify the meaning of Toynbee's technical term "related civilization"; and it does this by calling our attention to what is true ex hypothesi. But it has been claimed that Toynbee sometimes passes off such statements as empirically validated laws, seeming unaware himself that the course of the argument which purports to assemble the evidence for them actually converts them into logical truisms. Such criticism has extended even to what has been referred to as Toynbee's mostt significant generalization" :21 the assertion that civilizations develop in response to a challenge of adversity, grow through a series of responses to successive challenges, each arising out of the response to the last, break down through eventual failure to respond to a repeated challenge, and disintegrate into a dominant minority, an internal and an external proletariat. It is clear that if this generalization is to warrant the status of "an empirically validated hypothesis of the life cycles of civilizations",22 it must never become a matter of definition that civilizations display such a four-stage development. But this, his critics complain, is exactly what happens in Toynbee's original attempts to identify the civilized units with which his Study is to be concerned. As has been pointed out already, he begins with a comparison of the Hellenic Society with the West. Having elecited from their histories a four-stage pattern, he seems to use this pattern as a criterion of what else shall be included in the more detailed comparative study that is to follow. In some cases, for example, he argues for the recognition of a doubtful or little known society as a civilization on the basis of his having discovered in it a universal state with a career ana- logous to that of the Roman Empire.23 It is only his employment of the fours stage law as a criterion, it may be claimed, that could explain his dividing of societies like the Chinese or Indian into affiliated and apparented civilizations, or his classification of the Byzantine Empire as a new civilization rather than a continuation of the Roman Empire.24 As Oscar Handlin has put it, Toynbee's failure to provide an independent criterion of what shall be considered a civili- 21 J.

Taylor, "Much Learning. . .," ibid., 116.</page><page sequence="13">44 WILLIAM DRAY zation leaves us, in the end, with the conclusion that a civilization is "whatever behaves in conformity with the fixed pattern a civilization should follow".25 The breakdown of Toynbee's original definition of "civilization" as "the smallest intelligible unit of historical study" has, of course, often been discuss- ed; and his supporters have tended to regard criticism on this score as rather pedantic. It has been urged that, in the early stages of any new science, exact definitions are not to be looked for;26 it has even been counted as a virtue of Toynbee's practice - in an article which, it should be remarked, commends him as a poet - that his key terms "acquire their meanings through the accretion of successive contexts".27 But if it is really true that for Toynbee the four-stage law becomes the criterion of civilizations, no such defence can rebut the charge that the four-stage law is tautological. The truth of the charge would not, of course, imply that Toynbee makes no empirical discoveries. What is empirical, however, would then be simply the discovery that there are some civilizations (as defined), and not the additional knowledge that civilizations pass (or even that they "normally" pass) through the four stages. One obvious way in which Toynbee might try to meet the difficulty would be simply to renounce the claim that the four-stage law is intended to have the status of an empirical law. In this connection it may be noticed that he never calls this "most significant generalization" a "law" at all. And if we did take it as a definition, the empirical status of what he does call "laws" - which are all at a lower level of analysis - would remain untouched by the concession. He could still therefore represent his enquiry as attempting to explain why some societies pass through the four stages which make it appropriate to call them civilizations. That Toynbee himself did not regard the four-stage law as a mere tautology, however, is strongly suggested by much of what he says. It is his purpose, he tells us, to "map out the principal phases in the histories of civili- zations - their births, growths, breakdowns and declines" - in order to "work out a morphology of the species of society called civilizations" ;28 and his abili- ty to recognize, without reference to the four-stage law, six existing civilized societies, certainly suggests that he claims to know what a civilization is before he begins. The ingenious, even desperate, attempts he makes to show that certain recalcitrant examples like the Syriac civilization had a revived universal state rather than a fifth stage, or that the Egyptiac had a prolonged one, would also be somewhat implausibly explained on the tautological interpretation; for they would then be merely attempts to show that both societies were indeed civilizations. It seems to me, therefore, that the more promising defence of Toynbee's procedure is to accept the four-stage law as an empirical discovery (it was "' "In the Dark Backward," The Partisan Review, July, 1947, p. 372. 26 G. A. Birks, "Toynbee and his Critics," Philosophy, XXV (October, 1950), 337. '7 E. Fiess, "Toynbee as Poet," in Essays, 381. " C.T., 160.</page><page sequence="14">TOYNBEE S SEARCH FOR HISTORICAL LAWS 45 assumed in the previous section to be a law with "explained" exceptions), and as presupposing logically independent criteria for "civilization". If pressed, I think that Toynbee would claim to have such criteria; he would claim, at any rate, that he could recognize civilizations "intuitively". He speaks, for ex- ample, of having discovered a "relative discontinuity" in tracing back the history of the West through the fall of the Roman Empire (I, 43) ;28 and his frequent references, in Bergsonian language, to the ean of a growing civilization suggests a concept very different from the essentially causal one with which he seemed to begin. Such a defence would amount to accusing Toynbee of obscu- rity rather than logical error, and would not deny the need for much more careful discussion of the meaning of his central concept. And it would not necessarily absolve him of the charge that, at least in some of the more contro- versial cases, he did inconsistently use the four-stage law as if it were a definition. To the extent that he did, of course, the inductive support claimed for the law would have to be decreased.29 Toynbee's proneness to fall into analytic traps could be illustrated also at other levels of his enquiry. It shows itself, for example, in the logically out- rageous statement with which, at one point, he sums up his study of social break- down. "The ultimate criterion and the fundamental cause of the breakdowns of civilizations," he tells us, "is an outbreak of internal discord through which they forfeit their faculty of self-determination" (V, 17). And this looks very much like an attempt to reinforce an empirical claim (that internal discords cause breakdown) by converting it into a logical truth (that discordant societies have invariably broken down - discord being the criterion of breakdown). Such an interpretation, of course, assumes that by "criterion" Toynbee means 6'logical criterion"; and it is true that we sometimes refer to as criteria what offer us infallible signs of what we are investigating, although logically distinct from it. But it would be difficult to argue that it is the latter interpretation which should be placed upon Toynbee's use of the term "criterion" here. For non-logical criteria, or signs, would presumably be either the effects of, or the joint effects of the cause of, what they signify. The5ycould not themselves be its cause. A wider reading of what Toynbee says about breakdowns, however, although it will not rebut the charge of careless statement, will show that his considered view is not properly represented by such summary statements as the one 29 It is sometimes suggested that Toynbee has a religious criterion of "civilization", by which it is presumably meant that he has a conception of a civilization as a social unit bound together by similarity of religious belief, or religious institutions. Clearly this could not mean that a civilization was to comprise whatever is so integrated by some one "higher" religion, since higher religions only appeared in civilizations of the second generation. And if the criterion were extended to include any religion, this would require both a revision of the umits Toynbee has already identified, and the inclusion of primitive societies as well. What Toynbee actually says is that he uses religion as a criterion for classifying civilizations, already identified, into groups (I, 130) of related and unrelated civilizations.</page><page sequence="15">46 WILLIAM DRAY quoted above. For internal discord - the outbreak of "fratricidal war" for example - is really, for him, not a cause but a sign or symptom of a spiritual condition, which in Volume V he examines at considerable length. Such war may easily be the cause of a breakdown becoming worse, and perhaps in the end render the condition irretrievable - indeed, Toynbee usually writes as if he has been unable to discover a single case in which the appearance of this condition was not followed, after a fairly uniform period, by social disintegra- tion. The true antecedent cause of breakdown, however, is to be sought in certain conditions - in certain temptations, indeed - which are present in the social situation during a period of growth: what Toynbee calls the "mecha- nicalness of mimesis", the "intractability of institutions", the "nemesis of creativity". Once again, the charge of analyticity, the accusation of logical error, although perhaps justified by many of Toynbee's actual statements, can to a considerable extent be met by sympathetic attention to the course of his argument as a whole. I would suggest, therefore, that although a certain amount of logical repair work may be required by the actual text of A Study of History, there is no need to regard this difficulty as one which undermines the whole concept of the enquiry. III In arguing so far that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with Toynbee's empirical methodology, and that certain apparent obscurities in his concept of empirical law could in principle be overcome, I have not considered the diffi- culties for his whole law-seeking enterprise which arise out of his oft-repeated declaration that he is not a metaphysical determinist about human action. Let us therefore look now at what he himself says on this point, at the effect this stand has on the general coherence of his enquiry, and at certain efforts he makes to reconcile what he does with what he claims to believe. Perhaps the most striking statement of Toynbee's libertarianism is to be found in the passage in which he introduces his concept of "challenge-and-response". When an encounter takes place, he tells us, "there is one thing which must remain an unknown quantity to the best-informed onlooker, because it is beyond the knowledge of the combatants, or the players, themselves; and their ignorance of this quantity makes calculation impossible, because it is the most important term in the equation which the would-be calculator has to solve. This unknown quantity is the reaction of the actors to the ordeal when it actually comes" (I, 300). By one of Toynbee's reviewers, this concept of human action as a response to a challenge has been referred to as "fundamentally a biological concept".80 In view of the way Toynbee originally illustrates it from S F. Borkenau, "'Toynbee and the Culture Cycle," Commentary, March 1956, p. 249.</page><page sequence="16">TOYNBEE S SEARCH FOR HISTORICAL LAWS 47 literary sources, and the way he seems to ground it for the reader in his con- sciousness of his own rational and creative endeavours, it seems to me that such an interpretation is quite misleading. It blurs the difference between a "chal- lenge" and a "stimulus"; and it does not square with Toynbee's insistence, in the passage quoted, on the precariousness of predicting the results of an "encounter". It is true that, in prefacing the original passage with the remark that even "inside knowledge" is not enough because it is "not the same as complete knowledge", Toynbee may give the impression that it is our inability, in prac- tice, to discover all the relevant antecedent facts which makes the agent's re- sponse unpredictable. And this interpretation may appear to be vindicated by his subsequent observation that "these psychological momenta, which are inherently impossible to weigh and measure and therefore to estimate scientifi- cally in advance, are the very forces which actually decide the issue when the encounter takes place" (I, 301). For this will doubtless suggest that it is the impossibility of measuring, and hence of knowing with sufficient precision, the relevant antecedent factors, which prevents assured prediction. It might be argued, too, that Toynbee's denial of determinism may be less far-reaching than it seems; for he often speaks of determinism as if it were synonymous with "physical determinism". In introducing his concept of "challenge-and-respon- se", for example, he disposes first only of deterministicc solutions" of an environmental or racial kind, thus leaving room for the claim that it is only these that his apparent libertarianism is intended to rule out. But the whole passage originally quoted is prefaced by a denial of the "scientific postulate of the Uniformity of Nature", and at many subsequent points Toynbee speaks of man's freedom to respond to a challenge as if it introduced into history, not only novelty, but novelty which is unpredictable in principle because not pre- determined. "I am a believer in free will," he declares in a debate with Geyl; "in man's freedom to respond with all his heart and soul and mind when life presents him with a challenge."'3' And again: "there are some things in human affairs that have no pattern because they are not subject to scientific laws.9" Of "aan encounter between two or more human beings", which is one such thing, he declares: "I believe that the outcome of such an encounter would not be predictable, even if we had complete knowledge of all the antecedent facts.'"32 That Toynbee, in such passages, asserts human free will in a straightforward and tough-minded sense seems to me beyond legitimate doubt.33 To speak, therefore, of a "law"' of "challenge-and-response" would surely 31 The Pattern of the Past, 76. 32 "What I am Trying to Do," in Essays, 6. See also C.T., 30. 3 By this I mean to exclude assertions of freedom (much discussed by contemporary analytic philosophers) in senses compatible with determinism, e.g., that we have the capacity to do what we want, or that we are not coerced, or that we could have done otherwise if we had wanted to but did not, etc.</page><page sequence="17">48 WILLIAM DRAY be to miss the point entirely. As Geyl puts it, the concept provides a "striking formula" ;34 it offers us an explanatory model which sometimes applies. Yet, as Geyl and others have pointed out, Toynbee is led by the very character of his enquiry - his attempt to see how far the scientific method will carry him - to attempt the formulation of such a law, namely, the principle of the Golden Mean. A challenge, he points out, must be severe if it is to elicit a response; but not so severe that no response is possible at all. On the basis of what he calls a "comparison in three terms", Toynbee concludes that a maximum response is elicited, not by a maximum challenge, but by an optimum one; "the most stimulating challenge is to be found in a mean between a deficiency of severity and an excess of it".35 This, he remarks, puts his point in "scientific terminology". Geyl and other critics have noted correctly that, since no criterion of "opti mum" challenge is provided, apart from its being the one which elicits a maxi- mum response, this promising empirical discovery degenerates into a mere truism - it is an example of this "tautologizing" of empirical laws which was discussed in Section II of this paper. In the light of our present concern with Toynbee's libertarian principles, however, a quite different difficulty arises out of his attempt to formulate a law of optimum challenge. For it is conceivable that he might have provided us with an independent criterion for calling a challenge "optimum"; he might, for example, have attempted to estimate in a series of situations the degree of difficulty presented by each without reference to the responses which people in those situations actually made; and he might have arrived at a "mean" by comparing this estimate with another of the protagonists' capacity to interpret their situation as a challenge. But even if he discovered that a "Gmean"9 challenge, so identified, always in fact elicited a maximum response, he still could not assert this as an empirical law. For within the framework of his libertarian metaphysics, he could not rule out the possibility that certain agents might respond less than maximally to the "mean". And this is implicitly admitted by Toynbee himself when he points out, for example, that the Celts failed to respond to a challenge which the later response of the Teutons showed not to be excessive (I, 143). Toynbee could not even argue consistently for a weaker form of the law of the Golden Mean: that a maximum response is given only to an optimum challenge - for he would have to allow also the possibility of an agent responding maximally to a non-opti- mum challenge. The most he could rule out would be a response which exceeds the ability of the protagonist. For, apart from such limiting cases, on the inter- pretation of "challenge-and-response" which he originally gave, it will always be, at least in part, up to the unpredictable decision of the agent what the response to a challenge shall be.

See also II, 260, 360, 385.</page><page sequence="18">TOYNBEE S SEARCH FOR HISTORICAL LAWS 49 The attempt to convert "challenge-and-response" from a "striking formula" into a "law" exemplifies a "creeping" determinism which is observable at many points in A Study of History. It is illustrated by what one critic has called "a hardening of the categories" - a tendency in the later volumes to treat as established laws what were earlier states merely summatively or, at any rate, tentatively.36 It emerges powerfully in the astonishing contention that the Roman Empire was "doomed before it was established" - doomed some four centuries before, in fact (IV, 61). It appears to be expressed too, having regard for the way Toynbee's libertarianism has been mythologically explicated, in a curious identification of natural laws of the "subconscious" with "laws of Poetry and Mythology".37 To argue, as some have done, that Toynbee makes a distinction between the conditions of human action in the periods before and after the breakdown of civilizations, only the latter being subject to a pre- determined pattern, will scarcely offer us an escape from the difficulty. For Toynbee does not limit the applicability of his laws to the period following social breakdown; indeed, the "scientific" law of the optimum challenge is itself formulated in discussing the origins of civilization. In any case, Toynbee does not deny that men have free will during the later phases; indeed, he con- tinues to explain the actions of individuals and groups during breakdown and disintegration in terms of responses to challenges, although in many cases, now, inadequate ones. But a challenge-and-response situation is, on his own metaphysical principles, an unpredictable one whenever it occurs. There are times, of course, when Toynbee seems to acknowledge this - notably when he refuses to predict the collapse of the West in spite of his discovery of the symp- toms of breakdown in four hundred years of Western history. For his assurance that '"we are not doomed" - that through our own efforts we can hope to give history "some new and unprecedented turn" - is based not upon his Study, but upon his metaphysical principles: his belief in our God-given "freedom of choice'.38 At other points, however, his assurance wavers. It is true, he tells us, that "we cannot say for certain that our doom is at hand". But "we have no warrant for assuming that it is not; for that would be to assume that we are not as other men are" (VI, 320). It is apparently very difficult to deny consis- tently the "postulate of the Uniformity of Nature" in an attempt to see how far "the scientific approach to human affairs" will carry us. By the end of the work it is obvious, even to Toynbee, that he has two sets of metaphysical postulates in a state of unhappy conflict; and in Volume IX, in discussing the question of the respective "roles" of law and freedom in 86 F. H. Underhill, "The Toynbee of the 1950's," The Canadian Historical Review, XXXVI (September, 1955), 227. "I IX, 185. However, in "What I am Trying to Do" (loc. cit.), Toynbee insists that "the poetry and the prophetic vision that well up out of the subconscious depths of the human soul are not amenable to law". 31 C.T., 39.</page><page sequence="19">50 WILLIAM DRAY history, he makes a few tentative attempts to reconcile them. None of these attempts is very promising. The first is no more than suggested in a single passage, and perhaps it is not seriously intended (although in some ways it is the most philosophically sophi- sticated reflection made in the whole course of a very disappointing discussion). The suggestion arises out of Toynbee's remark that the concept of "law", even in scientific enquiry, is only a "metaphor". The only "literal sense of the word", he says, is "man-made legislation"; to use it in other than legal contexts is therefore to be "guilty of Anthropomorphism" (IX, 169). When we use it metaphorically, Toynbee adds, "we cannot help transporting the word's connotations". In discussing such connotations, he is quickly diverted to the question whether the laws of our universe (as the laws of the state are supposed to be) are "impartial" and "morally right". But another connotation trans- ferrable from the legal sphere would surely be that a Law of Nature can be broken. In this connection it might be noted that, in explaining the idea of the "inexorability" of the laws of an impersonal Nature, Toynbee directs our attention, not to certain elemental experiences of natural events, but to the law of the Medes and Persians, which was "unalterable" (but still, no doubt, "breakable", by anyone willing to pay the price) (IX, 171). And at some points in his Study, Toynbee does talk as if he took this anthropomorphic doctrine seriously. Thus the Egyptiac society, he tells us, after passing through the first two stages of disintegration, "passionately refused to pass away ... rebelling against the execution of the death-sentence which it had lawfully incurred" (V, 2). The same interpretation of "law" might also, perhaps, be called upon to explain the equanimity with which Toynbee at times accepts the discovery that some of his laws of history hold only "as a rule". But Toynbee never really tries to develop a fully anthropomorphic theory of science; and in con- trasting "Laws of Nature" with "Laws of God" it is the notion of an observable cycle of nature rather than that of Divine Legislation which he uses to explicate the measuring of the former. If Toynbee had pursued the suggestion that "law" is just a legal metaphor, he might in the end have arrived at the conclusion that the metaphysical theory of determinism, which he at one point called a mere "consolation of philosophy", is in fact devoid of meaning. But his frequent, and often urgent, reiteration of his libertarian beliefs - which would also then be literally meaningless - do not suggest his acceptance of such a resolution of the difficulty. A second possible resolution centers upon a distinction Toynbee draws between the "currency" of laws and their "incidence". It is impossible, he tells us, with certain cycles of nature in mind, to "divert the inexorable course of Nature by a hair's breadth".39 But although we cannot effectively control "the operation of these laws" we can control "the incidence of their operation on 89 IX, 171; also C.T., 31.</page><page sequence="20">TOYNBEE S SEARCH FOR HISTORICAL LAWS 51 Man's life". Man achieves his freedom, therefore, not by altering, but by "transcending", Nature's laws. The laws governing "day and year" cycles are transcended, for example, in "the cumulative experience and endeavour of a human being's life-time"; the laws governing the "generation cycle" are transcended in "the cumulative experience and endeavour of a human society in the process of civilization"; the laws governing the cycles of civilizations are transcended in "the cumulative spiritual progress of Religion through learning by suffering" (IX, 174). In the latter case, men obviously transcend, not only laws of physical nature, but also of human nature - those laws of individual and group psychology which provide so many explanatory principles for the his- torical laws which Toynbee's Study has elicited, and which, in rendering the actions of individuals to some degree predictable, may be thought to imply the most serious limitation upon free will. As an attempt to reconcile historical laws with the unpredictability of freely willed actions, however, Toynbee's doctrine of transcendence is surely a failure. For the sense in which we can transcend these laws (if we stick to the analogy of the physical and biological cycles) is simply that we need not be prevented by them from attaining our goal - provided our goal is increasing spiritual insight; for we may achieve this through the disintegration of civilizations. To suggest that we could tran- scend the laws of history in the sense of bringing the cycle of civilizations to an end is to confuse the issue by using the word "transcend" in a different sense. Yet, as has been pointed out above, it is this sense which is required if we are to continue to assert freedom of the will in Toynbee's original sense. And it is this sense, too, which is presupposed by Toynbee's final hope for a "higher type of society": a society which, as an earthly expression of all that is best in the higher religions, will constitute a "mutation" from the species "civilization". What may appear to be a third possible way out of Toynbee's dilemma arises out of his reflections upon the success of insurance companies in formulating statistical "regularities" which are applied, not to the behaviour of individuals, but to that of groups (IX, 222). Since at least some of this behaviour - e.g., burglaries consists of "conscious, deliberate and even carefully planned personal acts", it would seem that we must accept the conclusion that the free will of individuals is compatible with there being Laws of Nature governing the average results of its exercise. And if such laws can be "statistically ascer- tained" for the sort of cases dealt with by insurance companies, why should we not treat in the same way "those extraordinary public affairs which had been the conventional theme of History"? The question whether statistical laws of this kind can be asserted in the form of genuine universal statements is a difficult question for any social theorist. It is one which I should myself be inclined to answer in the negative, regarding them rather as summative general- izations used for short-run predictions without proper theoretical warrant. But the more important question here is whether, if they are considered as universal laws, they can be asserted without denying freedom of the will in</page><page sequence="21">52 WILLIAM DRAY individuals - a straightforward question of logic. It seems to me to be obvious that they cannot, since the truth of the law would necessarily be incompatible with the exercise of free will in some specifiable way by some individuals on some occasion. In a theory of history like Toynbee's, which places so much importance upon the roles of those individuals and minorities who use their freedom creatively, it is doubly difficult to see how the solution presently sug- gested could be considered acceptable. It should be remembered, furthermore, that it is Toynbee's practice to attempt to explain the currency of his historical laws; they are not just reported as "statistically ascertained" social regularities; and the explanation involves reference to our alleged knowledge of the way individuals would behave. To direct our attention to the activities of insurance companies therefore does not resolve the difficulty. It simply reminds us that social theorists besides Toynbee have the obligation to face it. Toynbee's final solution appears to be offered towards the end of his dis- cussion in the assertion of the logical compatibility of the concepts of law and freedom. "Law and Freedom in history prove to be identical," he tells us, "in the sense that Man's freedom proves to be the Law of a God who is identical with Love" (IX, 395). Insofar as anything determinate can be derived from a very obscure discussion of the matter, Toynbee seems to be saying that acts which, because freely willed, do not fall under the Laws of Nature, nevertheless fall under some law; for it is God's law, i.e., God's will, that we should be free to develop our natures through "encounters". Such a doctrine ought, in logic, to imply also our freedom not to do so; and insofar as it does, the resolution is little more than a verbal manoeuvre. For to be under the Law of God in that sense is simply to be under the law that our responses are (unpredictably) up to us. What Toynbee means by the Law of God, however, does sometimes seem to have more positive implications. By contrast with the cyclic regularities governed by the Laws of Nature, for example, the Law of God is said to have "the regularity of a single constant aim" (IX, 174). And although Toynbee's piety at other points prevents him from allowing that the content of God's Law can be known - for like those of any "spirit", God's ways are "arbitrary", "unpredictable", "ineffable" (IX, 172, 176) - we may assume at least that it is God's will that man should progress from the primitive state through civilization to the higher religious society. Taken in conjunction with Toynbee's warning that inexorable punishment for sin (presumably visited upon us through the operation of the Laws of Nature) "can be overcome only by accepting the jurisdiction of a 'Law of God"' (IX, 172), it may seem that man's freedom is freedom only to do God's will - an interpretation apparently supported by Toynbee's final declaration, with the rapture of a mystic, that "Law and Free- dom cease to be distinguishable; for 'tis only he that loves not that is fettered by compulsion" (IX, 405). But Toynbee does not really wish to assert the inevitability of man's spiritual progress; the freedom which man lacks, by reason of such divine compulsion is thus only the "feeling" of freedom, not the</page><page sequence="22">TOYNBEE S SEARCH FOR HISTORICAL LAWS 53 unpredictable freedom of an agent's response to an encounter. In the explana- tion of historical action, we may therefore expect human free will to function as it was originally and secularly described. It will require the denial that human actions are fully predictable by any Laws of Nature that could be discovered, including Laws of Human Nature (and of the "Subconscious Human Psyche"). It will thus rule out the assertion of Toynbee's historical laws. In attacking Toynbee's metaphysical principles I have no wish to imply that there is anything wrong with libertarian metaphysics as such. What I do want to insist is that to attempt on libertarian principles "to try out the scientific approach to human affairs to see how far it will carry us", is a self-contradictory enterprise. For it makes it impossible, from the start, that any presumptive evidence that might be found for the assertion of historical laws could ever attain the status of evidence. This seems, indeed, to be admitted by Toynbee himself, when, in discussing the prospects of the West, he assures us: "Even if all other civilizations that have come into existence so far were to prove in fact to have followed this path, there is no known law of historical determinism that compels us to leap out of the intolerable frying-pan of our time of troubles into the slow and steady fire of a universal state..."'40 For he could say this no matter how many cases he has examined; he makes it logically impossible that we would ever "know" such a law. The apparent search for such laws through ten massive volumes is thus reduced to an elaborate sham. Yet it might be argued that Toynbee's libertarianism is, as he actually pursues his empirical survey, more apparent than real; it does not prevent him from arguing from discovered regularities to laws; it does not even prevent him from asserting a "law" of challenge-and-response. It could, in fact, be regarded as an excrescence upon his theory of history - something to be ignored or reformulated in assessing the cogency of his conclusions. As a metaphysical indeterminist, and a skeptic about the existence of historical laws, I should not expect Toynbee's search, even after such revision, to be successful. But as an antinomian oppo- nent of Toynbee has recently argued, it is important to libertarians that the failures of deterministic social theory should be demonstrated by work of the highest possible standard.41 In the case of A Study of History this requires the abandonment of a libertarian gloss on a work basically deterministic in con- cept. If, in the end, Toynbee were induced instead to abandon his determinism, this would not, of course, imply that the efforts he devoted to his comparative study of civilizations were wasted because misconceived. For interpreted as merely summative or enumerative statements, his historical "laws" would still offer a monumental contribution to our knowledge of what man has done and suffered. And his rational, if now "indeterministic", explanations of the actions 40 D. C. Somervell, Abridgement, I, 553. 41 A.
