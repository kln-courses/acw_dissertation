<plain_text><page sequence="1">SEYMOUR HOWARD A Dossenesque "Double Herm" in California A half-life-size double herm in the J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu (pls. 1-3; 4:1),1 has uncommon archaeological interest for two good reasons: First, the little-known fragment admirably illustrates most attributes of Late Archaic heads; and second, it appears to be a patent fake recalling the ambience of the legendary forger Dossena. 1 Shortly after its acquisition for the collection, the herm (inv. no. A58.S5) was briefly discussed and described by P. Wescher, in "New Acquisitions," Bulletin of the J. Paul Getty Museum 1, no. 2 (1959) 12-14, cover illustration and fig. 8; this account was the model for a short entry by H. Stothart in Handbook of the Sculpture in the J. Paul Getty Museum (1965) 17f, pl. 9. Some information about the herm's purchase appears in J. P. Getty, The Joys of Collecting (New York 1965) 53, caption to the illustration: "Purchased in Paris in 1958 ([N.] Koutoulakis)." The piece is not there discussed by J. Charbonneaux, who wrote the short essay dealing with various ancient pieces in the collection; and it is not mentioned elsewhere in the text of the volume. The Getty Herm is made of a small-grained grayish-white marble, like that from the Greek islands and, Wescher noted, from Mount Hymettos. Some of the principal dimensions are as follows: height 16.5 cm., width 12 cm., depth 15.2 cm., chin to hairline 10 cm., nose to chin 3.5 cm., nose 4 cm., mouth 4 cm., eyes (to outer corer) 8 cm., male ear 3.5 cm., female ear and earring 4.5 cm. The right forelocks of the Kore are largely broken away. They were once darkly stained (pls. 1 and 8:2), perhaps by alkali burss" (cf. n. 16 and Addendum II) since removed. The left tip of the nose (formerly patched and generally injured on the underside) is missing. Scattered minor abrasions also appear on the hair, stephane, eyebrows, eyeballs, left cheek, lips, and chin. The rear parts of the maiden's neck and hair are rough finished; this condition is especially evident on her right side, which is everywhere battered above and behind this area.</page><page sequence="2">182 Seymour Howard There are many reasons for concluding that the piece is not the Archaic composition it pretends to be; certain anomalies of very comprehensive nature elicit immediate doubts. Take the Janus like format; it would in itself be unique among extant Archaic sculp ture, in scale and material as well as in the representation of its youthful subjects.2 The mutilations, otherwise canonical hallmarks of antiquities, are even more disturbing; they seem to be of modern manufacture. The disfigurement, though thoroughgoing, is as a whole improbably fortuitous. The damages to the piece are insignificant on what has effectively become the face side and on its fine left profile (pls. 1 and 3), which fully present an attractive maiden. On the other hand, the head of a less winsome pendent boy, like the inconsequential herm shaft, is virtually obliterated. The damages to this second head are particularly curious: Its face is not just heavily abraded; it has been chiseled away to a considerable depth (cf. pls. 2 and 4:1 top view, right side). This condition implies a very deliberate and thoroughgoing A break runs from low on the throat of the Kore toward the jawline of the Kouros. Only the rear central part of the right side of the Kouros is extant-from the back of the neck to mid-cheek and temple curls. His rear hanging strands of hair are mostly lost. On the other side of the head, only a patch of the neck can be identified-below rough finished passages. (For further discussion of the herm's condition and its significance, see the essay.) Special thanks are due the administration of the Getty Museum for cour tesies and assistance extended to me in these investigations. The generous interest and objectivity of the Museum Curator B. Frederiksen were, in particular, models of professional responsibility. 2 R. Lullies' catalogue lists include only five double-herm sculptures (Die Typen der Griechischen Herme [Konigsberg 1931] 65f). Of these five examples, none is made of marble, all are miniature, and none represents both an ideal youth and maiden. (On the origins of the double herm as a type and Archaistic examples of it in marble sculpture, see Lullies, "Hermenfragen," Wirzjbb 4 [1949-50] 139, and Harrison in n. 5 infra.) In his study "Hermes doubles," J. Marcade (BCH 76 [1952] 596-624) did not list any Archaic marble double herms, either. He did, however, illustrate several double headed sculptures on Archaic coins (ibid., fig. 19) and on black-figure vases (figs. 1, 23). There may in fact have been Archaic marble double herms, but the pieces noted by Marcade appear to represent shaftless anthropomorphic Janiform kantharoi popularized by Athenian potters in the Late Archaic period. The format of these vessels is also like that of the Getty Herm (cf., for example, J. D. Beazley, Etruscan Vase Painting [Oxford 1947] 118f: Janiform satyr and maenad head-vases in the Louvre [inv. nos. H 25, 77, 78] and in the Petit Palais [no. 389]; see also the Young Herakles and female in the Louvre [no. H 76] and in the Villa Giulia [ibid., pl. 28, 4-6, from Cervetri], as well as still other related variations [ibid., pp. 187ff and pl. 40]). Probably the Janiform kantharos was ultimately a prime source of inspiration for the Getty Herm composition-but apparently by way of a terra-cotta forgery of this type of vessel in the Louvre (cf. infra n. 6 and pl. 4:4-also illustrated by Marcade, who noted that its antiquity was in question).</page><page sequence="3">A Dossenesque "Double Herm" 183 program of injury in antiquity. And yet, opportunely, enough remains of the hair and ears to identify, unequivocally, a beardless Kouros rather than a second Kore-with which it might be initially confused because of the pendent curls. The face of this boy need not have been executed, and probably it never was. For with no more than the extant fragmentary references, the implicit scale, interest, and consequent value of the single Kore head was safely and sufficiently augmented; to add any thing more, other than a full rendering of the boy, would have been superfluous and could only have increased the likelihood of detection. This shrewd sort of artifice and felicitous economy is common to forgery, and to the work of Dossena in particular (cf., for example, pl. 6:1 for the hand of a "third figure" under the left arm of the girl, and pl. 5: 1 bottom, where a "missing" giant is represented by part of his left leg). A similarly economizing but somewhat less intensive program of defacement was undertaken on the Getty herm's right side (pl. 2). Here, too, what was ostensibly original surface was only partly removed. But there remain betraying flaws apparently due to oversight. Close inspection of the area where the Kore's ear should have been shows, for example, that its features were never more than lightly sketched in, with the point and chisel. These details would, of course, have been complete and important on an Archaic work, as they are on the other, prominent and better-finished side of the piece. Perhaps all of this part of the herm was meant to be mutilated further. But the considerable indistinctness, due to the abrasion and chemical decomposition of its unfinished surface, may have been thought suffi ciently obscuring. Except for the girl's mask, apparently little in these portions of the herm was brought to completion; this is very clear in the cursory modeling still evident in an undamaged area that separates the two necks. But for subsequently reworked detail in the girl's eyes and mouth, a final corrosive treatment was given all of the surface. Its effects are particularly evident in the once-polished flesh parts, whose sugary, melting quality is characteristic of restored marble sculptures excessively "cleaned" with acid. In the loosely rendered hair on the top of the heads (pl. 4: 1), a place of relatively little interest, the combined effects of breaks, artificial decomposition of the surface, and perfunctory execution are equally conspicuous. Other suspect and inept features in the rendering support the assumption that the herm is counterfeit. The level of the Kore's</page><page sequence="4">184 Seymour Howard neck is, for example, much higher on both sides than in front-enough to have accommodated the typical spreading schematic locks of hair evidently never executed on this ostensibly finished work. Also on the neck, the median line separating the two heads on their battered side (pl. 2) is vertical, indicating that both faces looked directly forward, as might be expected. On the more complete profile (pl. 3), however, this division is angled, implying illogically and inconsistently, but to good effect, that the more important, "better-preserved" head of the Kore was directed upward. In the hair, above this juncture on the neck, there is a long, deep, and rough gouge. Like a far less pronounced complement on the other side, this is no mark of excavation. Both were chiseled out and are covered with the same "encrustation" and deteri oration as the rest of the work. It has been suggested that these places originally served as grooves for a bifacial bronze-wreath insert.3 But no traces of metal stain or dowel holes for anchoring a wreath are evident. And for that function these slots seem excessively broad and deep. They are moreover uneven, mismatched, and incomplete-the channel does not carry around the top of the head. Like other eccentricities of the herm, the cuttings do, however, serve to augment its interest; and, simultaneously, they remove some difficulties in rendering-here, the complicated joining of the heads at the level of the hair, particularly on the more important side. Other inconsistencies-of chronology-also contribute to a suspiciously aggregate and disparate character in the composition. The double row of undelineated nodule-curls and the hanging neck hair of the Kouros reproduce far earlier hair formulae than the very late Archaic soft waves and the specific compound coiffure of the Kore.4 The patterns for the ears, on the other hand, reverse the fore 3 The notion, which perhaps gives entree to the forger's intent, was presented by W. de Griineisen (Sculpture grecque archaique: Etude sur les Kouroi et les Kores de la collection Lazare Moutafoff [Paris 1932] 38), who first discussed the sources and identification of the Getty Herm (see further infra in text and Addendum I). 4 Though multiple rows of curls framing the forehead had become a popular formula in Archaic kouros hair styles around the last quarter of the sixth century B.c., long hair hanging to the shoulders was no longer in vogue. These strands were by then typically represented as cut short or bound up. The curls on the brow had also become progressively smaller; they were mostly tightly-wound inscribed, "corkscrew" nodes, usually presented in more than two rows and in enface position (cf., for example, pl. 6:2 and G. M. A. Richter, Kouroi [London 1960] figs. 450ff, passim "after 525" [except fig. 559, from Marzabotto, where engraved detail-to be conceived of as once painted in?-is anomalistically missing from both the hair and eyes]).</page><page sequence="5">A Dossenesque "Double Herm" 185 going order: That of the Kouros not only seems rendered by a second hand but reflects a later, finer, and more mimetically convincing, near Classical scheme. The effect contrasts remarkably with the Kore's thickish ears ornamented with jewelry. Just as the Getty Herm is not original Archaic work, so it cannot be satisfactorily viewed as an invention of some later antique archaism-quite apart from the matters of its fabricated mutilation. Though archaized sculptures including double herms with ideal sub jects were made from late Hellenistic times and may ultimately have contributed elements to this composition, the Getty Herm shows a different, a stricter kind of archaeological intensity. To be sure, the archaisms of antiquity may reflect parallel interests in cultivated atavism. But these ancient productions tended to be freer, diverting adaptations, of rococo-like whimsy (cf., for example, pl. 4:2), or they were dryly mechanical copies or variations (pl. 4:3). Both were innocent genres designed to enhance an elegant new Greco-Roman taste for sophisticated, decorative, quasi-museological objects.5 Large flat undelineated curl nodules, like those worn by the Getty boy, often appear as parts of the schematic segmented waves on the back of kouroi heads until well into the Archaic period. But only rarely do they occur as isolated curls about the fore head, and then only in very early Greek glyptic sculpture (cf., for example, the Dipylon Head [ibid., figs. 50ff], as well as its sometimes questioned variant in New York [ibid., figs. 25ff]-a sculpture which was, incidentally, like the Getty Herm [cf. Addendum I], also first made public in 1932). Much less distinctly, this phenomenon appears in several Middle Archaic heads (ibid., figs. 326 and 371ff). For another "Late Archaic" forgery with a similar curl formula, see n. 12 and Addendum I: the Stockholm Kore. On the date of the Getty Kore type and its hair style, see infra in text and references in n. 15. 5 Wescher (Bull. Getty Museum 1, no. 2 [1959] 12ff), in commenting upon various Archaic features in the Getty Double Herm, conceded that there were discrepancies (1) between the Ionian and Athenian schemata found in its chin and cheek bones, (2) between the very late "Archaic smile" and its earlier-looking convex-lidded bulbous eyes, and (3) between the generally retarded-looking elements in the Kore and its Euthydikan parallels. He very briefly entertained the notion that the piece might be Archaistic work, but rejected the idea, again for reasons of inconsistency in style. A similarity between elements in the Getty composition and Greco-Roman archaisms was already noted in passing by Griineisen (p. 37) in support of his claims to its antiquity. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art Double Herm (inv. no. 51.18.9; pl. 4:2), according to the museum records, was acquired by W. R. Hearst in 1951 from the Castellani collection, where it was listed as found in 1883 at the Torre de Greco near Pompeii. This modern-looking piece of decorative art has many sure ancient parallels. Its form and handling are the same as those of the bifacial finials on the reconstructed railing of the grand second ship "of Caligula" at Nemi (S. Ucelli, Le Navi de Nemi [Rome 1927] figs. 236-239).</page><page sequence="6">186 Seymour Howard The Getty Herm in sum seems to be a modern forger's clever potpourri combining elements from a host of sources. Unlike the products of ancient historicism, the herm was intended to be an authentic Archaic sculpture; its slight telltale anomalies and anachron isms inadvertently betray the counterfeit nature of its subject and formal detail. In time, quality, and as a type this antico production is closest to the conceptions and renderings of Dossena and the circle of his con temporaries. A suite of comparable pieces is in the Naples Museum (V. Spinazzola, Le arti decorative in Pompeii e nel Museo Nazionale de Napoli [Milan 1928] pl. 252, top, nine examples, the outer two herms more strictly archaized). Several of its apparent companions in interment also came onto the market (see further D. G. Mitten and S. F. Doeringer, Master Bronzes from the Classical World [Mainz 1967] 296, no. 294, with two face views of the Los Angeles Herm). The discussions of B. Ashmole concerning Archaic and Archaistic attributes of the girl from Ince in pl. 4:3 and a companion in the collection introduce some of the many complexities involved in distinguishing these categories in Greco-Roman copies and adapta tions (A Catalogue of the Ancient Marbles in Ince Blundell Hall [Oxford 1929] 51, 55f, nos. 119 and 129, pl. 1). On the same plate in the Ince catalogue appear still other examples of the recurrent use of the Archaic style for female subjects in later antique copies and freer varia tions (ibid., nos. 11, 41, 82, 94). All these marbles are extensively restored and have been stripped of ancient surface to varying degrees. But the general configuration of the original compositions can still be discerned. Sundry manifestations of Hellenistic and Greco-Roman archaism in sculp ture, and an attendant literature, are dealt with at some length by E. Schmidt, Archaistische Kunst in Griechenland und Rom (Munich 1922); W. Fuchs, Die Vorbilder der neuattischen Reliefs (Rome 1959), in JdI, Supplemental vol. 20; and C. M. Havelock, "Archaistic Reliefs of the Hellenistic Period," AJA 68 (1964) 43-58, and "The Archaic as Survival Versus the Ar chaistic as a New Style," AJA 69 (1965) 331-340, esp. n. 44. The recent study of E. B. Harrison (The Athenian Agora: Archaic and Ar chaistic Sculpture [Princeton 1965] XI) is especially interesting in these connections not only for her valuable discussions about ancient Archaistic styles (pp. 50ff and passim) but for her treatment of its herms (pp. 108ff), particular specimens of the double-herm type, and that genre's genealogy (pp. 125, 237f; also nos. 163 and 205). On distinctions between allied antique and modern styles and the more essential-seeming ancient vision, cf. S. Howard, "A Cultural Parallel in Baroque and Hellenistic Portraiture," in Actes du Cinquihme Congres International d'Esthitique (Hague 1968) 686f. Because the unencrusted surface of the Getty Herm would indicate that the piece was never protractedly interred, and for other reasons later developed in this essay, discussion concerning its possible membership in a small extant class of forgeries made in ancient times is omitted. (On this latter class of works generally, see, for example, a recent succinct entry by L. V. Borrelli, in "Falsification and Forgery," Encyclopaedia of World Art, V, 335f. For a detailed exposition engaging the major questions necessary to such enquiries, see B. S. Ridgeway, in Antike Plastik [Berlin 1967] VI, 43-75, on the Piombino Apollo in the Louvre-critically reviewed by M.

Incidentally, that this older composition now seems a much more naive forgery than the herm should warn us that still more recent improvised fakes, for all their seemingly heightened accuracy, probably will, likewise, become increasingly obvious with inevitable changes in predilections and acuity. That this piece could have inspired another modern forgery reveals yet one more characteristic aspect of fakes-their frequent intramural and sub rosa interrelations in the history of counterfeiting. Among the forgeries that Furtwangler discussed as made after Archaic sculptures, he illustrated an equally bizarre work, a Head of Athena (pl. 4:5), then on the Roman market, that like the Getty piece might be taken for a herm and was made of Greek marble.7 The design seems to be derived mainly from portions of the goddess' central images in the Archaic Aegina pediments. Anachronistically early Orientalized animal detail is used in an elaborate triple-crested helmet that is otherwise reminiscent of a later scheme found in the Classical Phidian Parthenos. To judge from this and other similar contemporary efforts, Roman dealers had begun to respond almost impulsively to a rising taste for then still "primitive" Archaic Greek sculptures-a waxing interest in part enlivened by recent discoveries on the Athenian Acropolis and at other Greek sites. During the follow ing decades, Alceo Dossena and his fellows, with considerably aug mented finesse and informed supervision, apparently used such models once on the commercial market, along with adaptations after original antiquities, in making their forgeries. As the terra-cotta was quoted in the Getty Herm, elements in the marble Athena, along with other sources, seem to appear and progressively flourish in Dossena's own life-sized statue of the goddess (pl. 5:2), in his smaller striding statue 6 A. Furtwaingler, Neuere Falschungen von Antiken (Leipzig 1899) 21ff, figs. 17-18; the piece had been published by M. Collignon, in Monumens Grecs 2 (1895) 116-117, as ancient. Furtwangler noted that neither the technique nor the fabric were Greek (speci fically, Athenian or Corinthian) and that the piece appeared to be based upon Acropolis maidens and prototypes in Attic vase-painting (see also supra n. 2). 7 Loc. cit., pp. 6ff, figs. 2-3.</page><page sequence="18">188 Seymour Howard of an Athena (?) in a Gigantomachy group (pl. 5: 1), and in an Archaic Etruscan-style terra-cotta Diana and Hind reportedly by him.8 In their general effect, these compositions have an anecdotal and slightly finicky late-Edwardian eclecticism of styles now typically associated with his forgeries. Dossena, who began producing counterfeit sculptures around the end of World War I, reportedly abandoned the practice after the summer of 1928. Medical expenses for his dying wife had by then impoverished him, and he vindictively made his activities public when he learned that he, too, was being grossly cheated by his dealers. Though he made various depositions in consequent litigations, not all the products of his studio have been identified. The question naturally arises as to whether the Getty Herm may be his work. Its appearance immediately followed the heyday of his career, and much in its aura is allied to other of his sculptures.9 8 The Athena and Gigantomachy Goddess, along with Dossena's pedi mental group (n. 12), were first recognized as the work of one forger by John Marshall, who, as a European agent for the Metropolitan Museum in New York, had already purchased Dossena's "Archaistic" maiden (Addendum II and pls. 9-10). Marshall, who believed all these works to be by the same modern master, unfortunately died in 1928 without his sus picions being confirmed, shortly before Dossena's public confessions to their authorship. This history and various aspects of the forger's antico production are amply reviewed by B. Ashmole, Forgeries of Ancient Sculpture: Creation and Detection, Myres Memorial Lecture (Oxford 1961) 10ff; see also G. M. A. Richter, "Forgeries of Greek Sculpture," BMMA 29, no. 1 (1929) 3f, 144f. On the Diana, cf. most recently L. Banti, "Osservazione sulla Diana di St. Louis," StEtr 26 (1958) 237ff, concerning some of its anomalistic detail; for the initial more thoroughgoing treatment of the group, see R. Herbig, "Die Terrakotta Gruppe einer Diane mit Hirschkalb," AbhHeidel (1956) 3ff. Several good views of the piece are illustrated by W. Lusetti (Alceo Dossena Scultore [Rome 1955] figs. 7-9), Dossena's son, who possibly knew the work in the forger's studio. 9 Dossena's career and his various sorts of stylistic production figure promi nently in the many handbooks on art forgeries. Critical reviews of his techniques by 0. Kurz (Fakes [London 1948] 123ff, 133ff) and a biographical summation by F. Arnau (The Art of the Faker, tr. J. M. Brownjohn [Boston 1961] 249-267 and passim) are especially noteworthy among them. There is a small contemporary literature about the forger in a welter of articles that appeared in the popular press and art periodicals immediately following his very publicized confessions and his independent exhibitions (cf. H. Vollmer, Allgemeines Lexikon der bildenden Kinstler des XX. Jahrhunderts [Leipzig 1953] I, 188, for a lengthy colla tion). A short exonerating biography of Dossena was written by his son W. Lusetti in 1955 (supra n. 8, Preface), whose picture book illustrated in fifty-two plates various of the sculptor's original, Renaissance, and antico productions, without further documentation, which was assured as forthcoming.</page><page sequence="19">A Dossenesque "Double Herm" 189 The Getty Herm was first publicly recorded in Paris, where Dossena's Athena and other of his works were sold.10 It purportedly belonged to Baron Lazare Moutafoff, a hitherto unknown collector who possessed an astonishing suite of select Archaic sculptures, including four other unrecorded marbles (pl. 7) and two bizarre antico pieces (pl. 6:4-5). In their very sumptuous catalogue, published in 1932, its author, Wladimir de Griineisen, noted that the "pseudo-ionien" herm of Greek marble was found in a vineyard near Athens in 1888-just three years after the korai of the Athenian Acropolis were first dis covered. He also observed, after a very detailed examination and arguments concerning its condition and possible subject, that the piece was (1) the ideal bifacial bronze-wreathed cult herm set before the Old Athena Temple of the Athenian Acropolis and (2) that it not only was a sculpture of the kind invented by Kalamis and ostensibly seen by Pausanias but, specifically, was one of the herms mutilated by Alcibiades before his disastrous Syracuse adventure in 415! The extraor dinarily ambitious as well as complete nature of the attribution, with its intricate explanations for various technical anomalies, has at times almost the air of informed rationale. It is worth noting here that some years before, Carlo Albizzati, who for over a decade periodically exposed contemporary forgeries of antiquities, thoroughly discounted Griineisen's authentication of other ancient sculptures, including supposedly Archaic work, that appeared in the sales catalogue of yet another collection in Paris. This collection of works contained Griineisen's own "ancient" sculptures. It can be no surprise that the legitimacy of none of the herm's companions in the Moutafoff catalogue has been established in archaeological literature.11 In the attributed oeuvre of Dossena, the Getty Herm seems closest to parts of his masterpiece in the Archaic style, a scene of abduction (pl. 6:1). These fragments mainly reproduce elements in the then recently unearthed Eretria pedimental group (pl. 6:2), pedimental figures from the older excavations at Aegina (cf. pl. 5:3), and the Euthydikos Kore found in the Athenian Acropolis fill (pl. 6:3). But the composition also has important parallels in red-figure vase Before his death in a pauper's hospital in 1937, litigations in which Dossena was involved had resulted in a piecemeal list of his confessed works (cf. Arnau, p. 256). 10 For Dossena's works sold in Paris, cf. Arnau, pp. 249ff, 256f (the Athena). 11 On the content of the Moutafoff catalogue, its review, and Albizzati's comments concerning Griineisen's earlier sales catalogue, see Addendum I.</page><page sequence="20">190 Seymour Howard painting and in modern as well as ancient sculpture. By 1928, the " discovery," which was privately described as from a temple pediment at Velia, the site near Taranto where the Late Archaic Seated Goddess in Berlin was reportedly found, had profoundly misled various archaeol ogists and chemists-a situation that contributed weightily to Dossena's sudden notoriety.12 Details in the features, the treatment of the surface, and the brittle thin angularity of the Getty sculpture are most like what appears in the male head of the group-largely a wan adaptation of Aeginitan prototypes (pl. 5:3). Comparable similarities can be found in other of Dossena's works. Comparisons of the Getty Herm with the far cruder, more inconsistent, and thoroughly damaged "Archaistic" Kore in New York (pls. 9-10) are especially instructive (see Addendum II). A firm attribution of authorship to Dossena, for reasons of chronology and affinities in execution, is attractive. But no sure evidence forces this conclusion. Dossena was not the sole forger of antiquities in his time, and it is hardly sure that the herm is by him and not, as seems more likely, by some contemporary or follower working in an allied but even more strictly supervised manner in Paris. Such a master could easily have used the Janiform vessel in the 12 In an extensive article discussing his "reconstruction" of the Dossena Abduction and what he assumed was its place in Archaic art, F. Studniczka ("' Neue archaische' Marmorskulpturen, Falsches und Echtes," J7d 43 [1928] 140-229, esp. 171ff) related the group to many of what were probably the forger's sources of inspiration (and parallels) in ancient and modern art. The spectrum of referents is impressive: small ancient groups in the minor arts (figs. 30ff), the Aeneas andAnchises of G. L. Bernini (!) (fig. 39), scenes of abductions on red-figure amphorae by Euthymedes and Phintias (figs. 42f), drapery details of the Seated Goddess in Berlin (figs. 50ff), an Aegina Warrior (figs. 67-70, compared with the face of the Dossena youth, here pl. 5:3), and the Euthydikos Kore (figs. 71f, compared with the head of the Dossena girl). In the same article, when dealing with several contemporary forgeries that had recently come onto the market, Studniczka also illustrated the Gruneisen Athena (ibid., fig. 1; cf. also Addendum I), which is close technically to the "Buste de Kouros" in the Moutafoff catalogue (here, pl. 7:1) and a modern kore in Stockholm (ibid., figs. 2, 5-7; supra n. 4). This kore was acquired in 1913, ostensibly before Dossena began his antico production: its large-scale hair nodes, incidentally, are like those used for the boy in the Getty Herm. The other modern works Studniczka illustrated include two pieces by Dossena, his Athena (ibid., figs. 13ff) and the Gigantomachy Goddess (ibid., figs. 73ff). The Seated Goddess in Berlin (inv. no. 1761) is well illustrated and briefly discussed in R. Lullies and M. Hirmer, Greek Sculpture, tr. M. Bullock, 2nd ed. (New York 1960) 71, figs. 97-101, found in 1911. In an informative and rightly sober context, discussing several works whose antiquity has been alternately questioned and accepted, G. M. A. Richter (The Sculpture and Sculptors of the Greeks, 4th rev. ed. [New Haven 1970] 147f) noted that a controversy once centered about the genuineness of the Seated Goddess in Berlin, until the site of its excavation was thoroughly published.</page><page sequence="21">A Dossenesque "Double Herm" 191 Louvre and possibly a very small bronze Archaic double herm with beardless heads also in Paris, at the Cabinet des Medailles-along with still other sources-in designing the Getty Herm.13 This pattern of association to handy and multiple prototypes, so characteristic in the work of forgers, applies to the designs of the other Moutafoff pieces as well (for example, cf. pl. 7:2 and pl. 6:2, Theseus), also rendered in Greek-looking marble. Reputation has it that Dossena worked independently, inspired directly by the spirit of the antique, as it were-which is not strictly what we find in the Getty Herm. Clearly, this is a popular misconception-fostered largely by the forger's own arch claims to a purely unaffected originality. His work tended to be eclectically para phrastic in the narrow mode of a copyist rather than in that of a freely synthesizing academician. This quality of close and aggregate imitation is evident in his masterwork, as was noted. And it is evident in the Getty Herm to a degree even greater than in its companions in the Moutafoff catalogue.14 Specifically, the principal element of the Getty Herm, its Kore, duplicates with minor though significant variations a small head found on the Athenian Acropolis about the end of the last century (pl. 8:1 and 3). This Late Archaic Maiden (Acropolis Museum no. 641) has regularly been associated with the immediate predecessor-kin of the Euthydikos Kore and with an Attic synthesis of international styles about 500 B.c. It is understandable that these fine and pleasing young women of Ripe Archaic sculpture would be thought very market able and became favorite sources for both Dossena and the designer of the Moutafoff sculptures-if these masters are not in fact identical, at least for some of the works. Good but small illustrations of Kore 641 were already published by Hans Schrader in 1901: They were the 13 The Archaic double herm in the Cabinet des Medailles is discussed by Lullies (supra n. 2, Typen, p. 65, no. 1 [bibl.], H. 0.047); it is also illustrated and briefly described in E. Babelon and J. A. Blanche, Catalogue des bronzes antiques de la Bibliotheque Nationale, Department des Medailles (Paris 1895) 322, no. 734 (drawing); and A. Furtwangler, Kleine Schriften, eds. J. Sieveking and L. Curtius (Munich 1913) II, 433 (figure). A depressed band runs between the top of the heads-somewhat like the "wreath-channel" that appears on the sides of the Getty Herm. There is still another double herm in Paris, at the Musee Rodin, with fine life-size Archaistic Greco-Roman marble adaptations of a bearded and a youthful god (J. Frel, "Dionysos Lenaios," AA [1967] 31f, figs. 3-5), which might also have been known to the sculptor of the Getty piece. 14 See further Addendum I, para 2; and Addendum II, para 6.</page><page sequence="22">192 Seymour Howard first pictures in his formative volume on Archaic sculptures (pl. 8:1).15 Like the Louvre Rhyton, then, this Kore could easily have been known and used by Dossena before his retirement-as much as by any other sculptor, or adherent of his studio and/or its methods, in Rome or Paris. The differences between the Getty Herm and its Archaic model reveal still more information about its author and manufacture. Addition of the second head not only enriched and partly disguised the antique composition but eliminated any need for an illustration of the rear view of the girl-not then published. The hair style, with its complex and short-lived two-staged overlay-that partially anticipated the simpler, more compact, and parted Euthydikos Kore formula-was superficially understood and excessively, somewhat decoratively, flattened. Because its means were intrinsically foreign to him, the forger was apparently also not able to make the Archaic smile and the rest of the modeling as robust or as integral as the original. He may, in addition, have used the running drill (but sparingly) in fashioning the strands of wavy hair in the Kore's front locks, now heavily etched with acid. This technique was not introduced into Greek art until the late fifth century, as Sir Bernard Ashmole noted when he dealt with Dossena's Abduction as a forgery.16 Perhaps because detail was not very clear in Schrader's soft illustrations-which may also 15 H. Schrader, Archaische Marmor-skulpturen im Akropolis-museum zu Athen (Vienna 1909) 1 (illustrations of front and left profile views, here pl. 8: 1) and 37 (discussion). Before the Moutafoff exhibition in 1932, an en face view was also published by E. Langlotz (Fruegriechische Bildhauerschulen [Nurenberg 1927] 154, pl. 95, fig. F [the same as Schrader's]). Unpublished photographs of Kore 641 may of course have also been available to the sculptor of the Getty Herm, but the two illustrations in Schrader, which correspond to the most com plete views of the Getty Herm, seem to have been its creator's source for still other reasons, to be noted. The four cardinal sides of Kore 641 are illustrated in H. Payne and G. M. Young, Archaic Marble Sculpturefrom the Acropolis (London 1936, 2nd ed. New York 1950) 72, pl. 81, figs. 1-4; see also the brief summary and description in G. M. A. Richter, Korai (London 1968) 103 (bibl.), figs. 197-198. 16 "An Alleged Archaic Group," JHS 50 (1930) 99ff, figs. 5-7; tooled breaks and artificial patina on the group are also discussed and are illustrated with details (ibid., figs. Iff). Marks of the fixed drill, employed in Archaic times, are evident in the eyes and hair of the Moutafoff sculptures. But, as in the Getty Herm, the marks of the running drill seem not so clear (cf., however, the temple strands in pl. 7:3). It is perhaps worth noting that Ashmole's critical observations about the use of this tool were published shortly before the appearance of the Moutafoff collection in 1932. More recently, in a short revealing essay dealing with several historic phases of modern fakery of ancient marbles, Professor Ashmole enlarged upon, as well as reviewed, still other matters concerning Dossena's production, including (a) his four best known "Archaic" marble sculptures and their detection (supra n. 8, Forgeries of Ancient</page><page sequence="23">A Dossenesque "Double Herm" 193 help to explain the indistinctness of the herm's complicated coiffure the upper eyelids of the Getty Kore are not defined by a modest fold, as in the original work (pl. 8:3) but are rendered in the more com monly encountered rudimentary concave channels that are found in all but the latest Archaic faces. Perhaps also because it is not visible in the forger's apparent model-Schrader's small illustrations-the shallow cleft in the Acropolis Kore's chin does not appear in the Getty Herm (cf. pls. 1 and 8:2). In the herm, the chin, like all the face, is thinner, sharper, and weaker than in the ancient prototype-a tendency more consistently pronounced in the "antico improvisations" of Dossena than in the pieces by the Griineisen-Moutafoff master. Clearly, for now, an attribution of the Getty Herm to any specific modern author remains uncertain. L'amour pour l'archaique grec est d'ipoque recent. W. de Griineisen, 193217 It would be unfortunate if the Getty Herm were removed from exhibition near its many worthy ancient companions-as such Sculpture, pp. 10-15, figs. 20-31); (b) the forger's primary sources for reproductions-casts in the Museo dei Gessi in Rome and his copy of Winter's Kunstgeschichte in Bildern (cf. Adden dum I); and (c) the methods ofpatination that he employed-including alternate immersions in hot ashes and water (cf. Albizzati and Ashmole in Addenda I and II). In this discussion of Dossena there is also reproduced (p. 15) a particularly informative and lengthy account by the secretary ofJ. Marshall (supra n. 8 and Addendum II), a Miss Rivier, who with Miss Richter visited the forger's studio in September 1928. The document is interesting in the context of this study because it records the suspiciousness of Dossena and his archly defensive pride in the supposed invention of his forgeries (then to be seen in fragments, sketches, or reproductions in his storage rooms). But it is still more important because it makes clear (1) that Dossena did not work alone, (2) that some of his antico sculp tures were then still in preparation, (3) that not all the works in his studio could be clearly seen, and (4) that there were photographs of still "other pieces, but he couldn't show them." Dossena's immediate legacy remained alive long after his death. The dealer A. Jandolo (" I falsi in arte," L'illustrazione del Medico [July 1950] 13) has, for example, written informatively about a talented student of Dossena who was apparently still a forger of ancient sculpture about twenty years ago and also possessed a defensive air of secretiveness very much like that of his master. 17 Supra n. 3, Sculpture ... Moutafoff, p. 11. In several pages of introduction (9-12), Griineisen warmly discussed the contemporary reclassification of Archaic sculpture from what was once considered inferior art, even at the time of the great discoveries in the late nineteenth century, to one of great beauty, all the more valuable for its rarity. This, he confided, was because of the leadership and enthusiasm of an elite of artists, archaeologists, and collectors-like Moutafoff-with a prescient vision worthy of emulation-assumedly by purchasing one or more of the select works in his collection, apparently then for sale (see further Addendum I).</page><page sequence="24">194 Seymour Howard questionable pieces have usually been, elsewhere. This sculpture possesses no little intrinsic charm, as archaeologists have confessed. But more important, appropriately identified, it also has very rich instructive value because of what it tells us about attempts to recapture the once-exotic and then fashionable and compatible visions of Classical antiquity. University of California Davis ADDENDUM I The catalogue in which the Getty Herm appeared (Griineisen, supra n. 3, pp. 35-38, pls. 9-11, "Kouros et Kore, tete bicephale") was published by the Gallerie Georges Petit in Paris ("Aegina" Press). This sponsor, the sumptuous format for the sculp tures, the advertising as well as legitimatizing character of the text, and an assumedly Czarist expatriot private owner for the collection all point to its availability for sale. In this commercial connection, it is probably significant that none of the three views of the Getty Herm in the Moutafoff catalogue fully show its heavily deteriorated right side or top or back. Like the Double Herm, each of the other pieces in the catalogue was illustrated from various angles with large attractive plates, extensive accounts, and supporting illustrations and references to related, often apparently prototypic, Archaic monuments that would serve to elevate and authenticate them. The "advertized" pieces in the collection included two youths ("Buste de Kouros," pp. 9-23, pls. 1-5 [here, pl. 7:1]; and "Tete de Kouros [Apollon]," pp. 25-34, pls. 6-8 [here, pl. 7:2]) and two maids ("Tete de la 'Kore a la Belle Bouche'" [cf. pl. 6:3 "La Boudeuse"!], pp. 39-49, pls. 12-14 [here, pl. 7:4]; and "Statuette Rituelle de Sculpture Grecque," pp. 51-57, pl. 15 [front and back] [here, pl. 7:3]). The Getty Double Herm literally, and aptly, faces and separates its companions in the text. In addition to the sculptures of the Moutafoff collection, there is illustrated a patently modern inscribed bronze plaque (pl. 6:5) labeled as owned by Moutafoff. It represents "L'Oracle de Delphes... Image votive offerte pour etre suspendue dans le Temple</page><page sequence="25">A Dossenesque "Double Herm" 195 de Delphes" and is a diverting pastiche whose elements are drawn from sculpture, vase-painting, and Etruscan murals, as well as sundry literary sources. Most of what seem to be its sources of inspiration were men tioned in an isolated account of its details in Griineisen's annotation (ibid., pp. 9f, n.). The "Aegina" emblem (pl. 6:4) on the title page of the Moutafoff catalogue also deserves brief mention, since it is in keeping with the character of the rest. The insignia illustrates a decorative, more blatantly "moderne" relief "fragment" with the head and shoulders of an "Archaic" warrior. In one extraordinary particular this composition recalls a forgery given to the Metropolitan Museum for study-a fragment which otherwise faithfully copies elements of a Dying Warrior from the Aegina pediments (Richter, supra n. 12, p. 141, fig. 565). Both have "Corinthian" helmets in which an ill conceived hinged cheek protector is shown simultaneously in its up and down positions. S. R. [the noted French archaeologist, Salomon Reinach], who wrote the single very brief review of the Moutafoff catalogue (RA 36 [1932] 113), simply expressed wonder at its luxury and the complete ness of the descriptions, confessing surprise that these hitherto un recorded pieces assumedly from Athens could have been acquired by the happy collector, of whom he had never heard. The withering observations of Carlo Albizzati concerning the modernity of the so-called antique works in Griineisen's first sales catalogue (Art Classique; Exposition Gallerie M. Bing; Sculpture grecque, romaine, etrusque etc., Exposition de la collection W. de Griineisen [Paris 1925] 58 pp., 31 pls.) appeared shortly after its publication-in "Analecta Gruenesiana," Historia 1, no. 1 (1927) 28-41, figs. 1-9 (cf. especially pp. 28ff and figs. la-lb for the notorious and often reproduced Grii neisen Athena). Because the contents of the Griineisen collection were so criticized, one may legitimately wonder if the unknown collector " Moutafoff" (in Russian, derived [ ?] from a descendant of" muddied," what is soiled or obscure; scandalmonger; or a Tartar proper name), were not in fact only a drolly resurrected "Lazare," a pseudonym for the author, Grineisen, a former member of the Czarist academy and also apparently a White Russian expatriot (Griineisen, Sculpture... Moutafoff, p. 12). Albizzati's review "Nuove e vecchie trovate dei fabbri canti d'antichita," Historia 3, no. 4 (1929) 649-672 (bibl.), is another</page><page sequence="26">196 Seymour Howard valuable compendium dealing with fakes. There, he observed (pp. 649ff, n. 1, fig. 1) that the Stockholm Kore (cf. nn. 4 and 12) was based -like other pieces in his selection of forgeries-upon illustrations in Franz Winter's large folios for the Kunstgeschichte in Bildern (Leipzig 1900 and 1913ff). See further Ashmole, cited in n. 16, on Dossena's use of that source. Albizzati there also observed, before the appearance of the Moutafoff catalogue in 1932, that various antico pieces by Dossena (pp. 655-659) showed the same technique as forgeries he saw in the first sales catalogue of Griineisen! He was the first to note that the surface decomposition of Dossena's works was the result in part of heating the marble (cf. supra n. 16 and Addendum II). ADDENDUM II Comparisons between the Getty Herm and Dossena's Metropolitan Kore (pls. 9-10) serve to point up various problems, and some major shortcomings, in attributing it to the master forger ex clusively on technical or stylistic grounds. Though they differ considerably in format-less so in scale-these works are quite similar, and encourage close comparison. Both are elegantly mannered less than life-size improvisations based upon Late Archaic sculptures of girls-primarily the charming figures nearest the Euthydikos Kore. And they have in common many dis tinctive attributes of execution: The Metropolitan Kore's fortuitous, seemingly authenticating deteriorations-(a) cracks (through the neck and thighs), (b) breaks (on the base, left thigh, and lower arms [these latter were never more than stumps, and the right elevated forearm "remnant" should have fit into a socket, see, e.g., pl. 6:3]), (c) casual and obscuring surface damages (especially gouges about the hem and at the breasts and buttocks), and (d) lack of finish (particularly in the above details and in the folds)-all find their parallels, on a modest scale, in the Double Herm. So does a ubiquitous studied abrasion and chemically induced corrosion. The foregoing qualities are, however, characteristic of many forgeries of antiquities; they hardly assure common authorship. Besides, the New York Kore is distinctly cruder and more internally contradictory than is the Malibu Herm, which would argue against their close association. This is seen especially in details like (1) the</page><page sequence="27">A Dossenesque "Double Herm" 197 rough, discordant features of the head; (2) the obvious and anachronis tic use of the running drill (cf. supra and Ashmole in n. 16) in the drapery, hair, and toes; and (3) the freely opening passages in the composition-especially in the arms and lower legs. The centrifugal character and mimetically standard handling of these last particulars, like the outsized head, contrast so disjointedly with the torso and its compressed schematization (cf., pl. 6:3) that the overall effect of the piece originally led to the conclusion-far more than for the herm (cf. supra n. 5)-that it was Archaistic, not Archaic, sculpture. The surface of the small statue has also been more severely, and complexly, treated than that of the herm. Perhaps the Kore was initially washed with acid (cf. especially the back), as the herm ob viously was, at the end. But, unlike the Getty piece (cf., however, n. 1, paragraph 4, and pl. 1, especially upper left, now cleaned away), the principal decomposition in the New York Kore seems to be due to alkalis. Probably it was put face down-on its most abused side-in a bed of hot ashes and then immersed in cold water, which should have made its white Italian marble etch, shiver, crack, and discolor, in the way in which we see it now. Such means and their consequences are recognized as hallmarks of the antico works of Dossena (see further n. 16, Addendum I, and Studniczka, JdI 43 [1928] fig. 21, Athena). The execution of the Metropolitan Museum Kore is harsh when compared with Dossena's other attributed antico works. Certainly it is not so formally restrained or archaeologically circumspect as the principal sculptures in the Moutafoff catalogue. But then the Getty Herm is also somewhat apart from its companions in the Moutafoff catalogue-in qualities of finish, lightness, and iconographic complexity. It can be viewed, stylistically, almost as a bridge between the two larger bodies of work-with the heads of the Moutafoff "Apollon" (pl. 7:2) on one side and Dossena's Gigantomachy Goddess (pl. 5:1) on the other. This is not to say that all these productions necessarily are from the oeuvre of one master: It does, however, at the least, point to a close, a shared tradition in these works. The many Archaic sculptures illustrated in the Moutafoff catalogue as comparative evidence probably were partial models for the modern artist. As well as from Athens, and elsewhere, various of these were from the Louvre, near the sale and, possibly, the master. The explicit sources for the herm are, not surprisingly, omitted (see nn. 6 and 13 [examples in Paris] as well as 15). Though also imitative, the</page><page sequence="28">198 Seymour Howard other four Moutafoff sculptures seem not as thoroughly copied from specific models. Even the "Apollon" (pl. 7:2), which so strongly recalls the forms of the Eretria "Theseus" (pl. 6:2; see also Grineisen pp. 26f [2 figs.] for a Louvre kouros head that is equally close in appearance), very obviously departs from such a prototype in its prominent hair-curl pattern and other, lesser details. Perhaps here is another indication that the herm is a bridging, transitional work closely related to, if not wholly in the tradition of Dossena. Full thanks are due D. von Bothmer and J. Frel for cour tesies extended during my examination of the Metropolitan Museum Kore. The role of John Marshall, who purchased the Dossena Kore, as an agent for the museum (1906-1928), is commented upon in passing in D. von Bothmer and J. Noble, An Inquiry Into the Forgery of the Etruscan Terra Cotta Warriors in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York 1961) 28 pp., along with observations concerning certain other for geries Marshall acquired for the museum during this time and mention of sundry personalities then involved in the traffic of terra-cotta for geries in Rome. For additional information concerning the acquisition of the Metropolitan Kore in 1926, its subsequent history, and various of its technical features and illustrations, see further n. 8; Richter, BMMA 29, no. 1 (1929) 144f, figs. 9, 11; and Ashmole, p. 11, figs. 20, 29 (head).</page></plain_text>
