<plain_text><page sequence="1">Notes on the Corpus Christi Plays and "The Green Pastures" By ROBERT WITHINGTON MODERN scholars specializing in the field of early drama are prone to stress text, sometimes, rather than consider the details of production. Lists of guild purchases, and stage-directions, with an occasional description of or reference to the guild performances, are our only guides to the latter, save as common sense may come to our aid. Those who, for instance, sug gest that there were dressing-rooms under the pageant-wagons, forget that there was neither occasion nor opportunity for the actors to change their costumes during the production of a cycle. There is, of course, no reason to suppose that all the pageant-wagons were alike: some may have had room beneath for the storage of properties, if not to give some actor space to await an entrance to the stage above through a trap-door, while other stages must have been near enough the ground to allow the action to overflow upon the street. Herod could hardly "rage" convincingly, if he had to climb down a ladder from some great height,1 and get back; he could, perhaps, have fallen, or jumped, three or four feet. Again, if the stages were very high, the people in the street could not have seen much of the action. The performances of The Green Pastures—Marc Connelly's "fable,"— throw some light on other details which students of the Corpus Christi drama are likely to overlook. I do not, of course, mean to imply that this play is produced as mediaeval plays were produced—either on pageants or on scaf folds around a "place." But the spirit of the old plays is here, insofar as it can be reproduced in modern times, and we can see the effect of the Biblical material on audiences, who, while "sophisticated," watch the work of naïve actors. It may be taken for granted, I think, that the author of The Green Pastures was not unmindful of the mediaeval guild productions.2 While the play confines itself to Old Testament stories, only hinting—very delicately— 1 See the famous stage-direction in the Coventry Magi, Herod, and the Slaughter of the Inno cents, after line 783. When "Erode ragis ageyne," after line 801, he may still have been "in the strete." In the Digby Mary Magdalene, the stage of the Devil apparently had an underlayer, perhaps recalling a Hell under some pageant-wagon used for the Last Judgment: "here xal entyr the prynse of dylles in a stage, and Helle ondyr-neth that stage ..." But it is not clear that any action takes place in "Hell," which may have been only pictured. 2 When his play was prohibited by the English censor, because God was impersonated on the stage, the playwright is reported to have remarked, "I am mildly surprised to find the Lord Chamberlain's office unable to distinguish the difference between orthodox sacrilege and a simple miracle play." See Time, June 30, 1930.</page><page sequence="2">194 THE SHAKESPEARE ASSOCIATION BULLETIN at the material of "Paradise Regained," it reflects, at least as far as actors are concerned, the spirit of the mediaeval productions; the childlike attitude attributed to both actors and audience of the Middle Ages is not easily recap tured, and cannot be imitated. It is, perhaps, worth remarking that The Green Pastures (which is not without a supernatural element) barely alludes to, and does not represent, the devils which give a comic touch to the mediaeval cycles. If one needed proof that the unit of the guild plays was the scene on each pageant-wagon rather than the cycle as a whole, one would find it in The Green Pastures.3 In this play there are eighteen scenes in two parts, acts, or divisions; and they are loosely connected by the figure of "the Lawd," who appears in practically all of them. A certain unity is counterfeited by the return, in the final scene, to the heavenly fish-fry of Part I, scene ii,4 but the general effect of the play is episodic. Each episode stands out as a separate entity, making a series of pictures, rather than a closely-linked whole; there is little attempt to show a cause-and-effect relation between the scenes. As Miss MacKinnon points out (5 P, July 1931, p. 441 f.) the figure of Deus appears in four closely connected scenes in the York Cycle, but she seems to forget that the part was not taken by the same man (even if the scenes had a common author) ; and while there may have been an attempt to make the "Dei" resemble each other (in some productions, when God was vox et praeterea nihil, the differences might not be marked), the unity which she finds is, I imagine, more obvious to a reader than it was to the audience which witnessed the production. Just what cause-and-effect relationship there might be between the Deluge and the Sacrifice of Isaac, 3 Miss MacKinnon, in S P for July 1931, p. 441, takes me to task for holding this belief. One cannot deny that often the Corpus Christi scenes dealt with connected material—one may even admit that much of this Biblical material was more closely connected in the minds of the mediaeval audience than it is in ours. But one may question whether the various dramatists, or those members of the audience who followed one pageant-car on its peregrinations, rather than watched in one place to see all the pageants, regarded each scene in the light of an "act" in a longer play. It is, course, impossible to prove what a medieval audience thought; but one can note one's own impression on seeing somewhat similar productions. The Oberammergau play gives one a sense of unity, as it tells the story of the events between the Entry into Jerusalem and the Ascension; this unity is lacking in The Green Pastures. 4 The frame—which is more than a prologue—of the Sunday-School class, rehearsing the stories of the early books of the Bible, lasts well into the play, as Mr. Deshee's voice reminds us, from time to time, that his class is still in session. It is unnecessary to point out that this dramatic device was common in Elizabethan times: Peele's Old Wives Tale, Greene's James the Fourth, and Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew furnish well-known examples. 5 It might be mentioned that the mysterious shadow of Hosea, which hovers before the door of "the Lawd's" office, without appearing on the stage, exerts a gentle influence upon the Creator, and prepares for the development of a God of Mercy from a God of Wrath. The Lawd's realization of the truth that happiness can come only through suffering would be a climax, if it clearly depended upon anything that had gone before, instead of being (as it seems) a revelation from Hezdtel. There is no character-development in the mediaeval cyclic Deus.</page><page sequence="3">THE CORPUS CHRISTI PLAYS AND "THE GREEN PASTURES" 195 for instance, it is hard to say; but Miss MacKinnon does not mean to regard every pageant as a scene in a closely-linked cycle: she finds the cycle made up of "grouped" plays, like the episodes of the Conterbury Tales.5 In both the old and the new plays, the anachronisms and local touches serve /paradoxically) to add to the realism. The older Noah, praying to the Trinity; Herod, swearing by Mahomet; the shepherds talking of Wading Street, and singing in breves and crotchets; Pharaoh, exhorting his followers to heave up their hearts unto Mahound, and "the Lawd" pocketing a ten-cent cigar, are touches of the same kind, for the same end. The older drama and the modern play had an anthropomorphic God-—and the modern audience cannot claim superiority over its ancestors; for though our God may not be a black preacher, or the variously-conceived mediaeval Jehovah, he is human, and shares a certain element of the more naïve representations of the'Deity." In the Middle Ages, when religion was a vital force in the life of the people, humor was not tar removed from it. The spontaneous laughter of pure pleasure is not incompatible with deep religious feeling; the simple are rarely shocked—the innocent have no need of propriety. Our laughter, when it is evoked by mediaeval plays, is no echo of the fourteenth-century laughter; those who smiled "at The Green Pastures admitted their feeling of superiority. In a recent paper, Mr. Fletcher Collins discusses "Music in the Craft Cycles,"7 coming to the conclusion that we cannot get an idea of the effect produced by these plays without a knowledge of the music with which they were accompanied. It is unnecessary to remark that the union of music and drama is as old as the drama itself. The word ode is seen in both comedy and tragedy, dating from Greek times. The dialogue of.the English liturgical drama was sung in stanzaic form; later, there is the tradition of lyrics in Elizabethan plays; and in the more recent melodramas (melody and drama), the emotional appeal of certain scenes was heightened by the soft music of the orchestra. Before the era of the "talkies," music added much to the effect of the "movies" (which were pretty flat without it) ; and if the singing of "spirituals" in The Green Pastures contributed no small part to the final 6Modem taste objects to the figure of Christ on the stage (unless so disguised, as in The Passing of the Third Floor Back, or The Servant in the House, that we could mistake him for someone else) ; but we do not mind "the Lawd." We might object to a presentation of God, if the figure were more like our conception of Him. 7 P M L A, for September 1932, pp. 613-621. After observing that "music—song, particu larly—was an integral, dramatic factor in the plays," he notes that "its position and importance are analogous to that in a recent New York production, The Green Pastures (1930)." Both this play and the cycles would have been "poorer, less dramatic, less intense, less alive" without the music with which they were accompanied, (p. 621).</page><page sequence="4">196 THE SHAKESPEARE ASSOCIATION BULLETIN impression left by the play, may we not assume that music was equally impor tant in the Corpus Christi Cycles? The popularity of The Green Pastures—partly, of course, due to the excellence of the production, and perhaps also to a certain curiosity on the part of the public—shows that the Biblical material has a universal appeal. If any of the audience came to scoff, the sincerity of the players must have sobered them. Surely the play was written with the spirit of the mediaeval dramatist; but the spirit of the public has changed, and cannot be restored to that of the Middle Ages. Even the most sympathetic of us has difficulty in reconstructing the attitude of what we are pleased to call "the naïve public" of six hundred years ago, but if we could see an audience composed entirely of unsophisticated Negroes, with no white man visible, witness The Green Pastures, we might get as near the audiences which witnessed the Corpus Christi plays as anyone ever could. As Professor George F. Reynolds has observed (5 P, October 1931), the audience is not to be ignored. Miss MacKinnon points out (loc. cit., p. 438) that three manuscripts of the York Cycle "with their 48, 51, and 57 pageants. . . . would seem to indicate extraordinary discrepancies in production at different periods, and one might conclude that the cycle lacked any degree of structural unity." The mere fact that the fluctuation, which "arises from the needs of the crafts for a reapportionment of the material into suitable acting units," can be made, sug gests that even if the subject-matter remained the same story from Creation to Judgment, the contemporary audience regarded the individual pageant as the unit, rather than the cycle. The Noah scene, in The Green Pastures, could easily be omitted—of another Biblical scene substituted—without disturbing the public (unless it counted on seeing the Noah scene), so loosely is the play woven; one can hardly rearrange acts and scenes in a carefully constructed play—any more than one can rearrange or omit lines in a carefully-written sonnet—without introducing confusion. There is a danger in attributing to an earlier audience a feeling for "dramatic units" which familiarity with later plays, divided into acts and scenes, has given us—and so in imposing our point of view on a public which at best could vaguely feel such units (larger than the "single scenes on indi vidual pageant wagons")—the unity being somewhat vitiated by the fact that even when the same character appears in more than one "scene," it is acted by different men. (The "central action" of the York Cycle, as Miss MacKinnon points out, employs some thirty "plays"—but each had a different corps of</page><page sequence="5">8 To its contemporary public, as to us, the Secunda Pastorum must have seemed complete in itself. The question of single or multiple authorship of the cycles cannot be touched on here: some cycles may have undergone revision by one man—whether they were written originally by a single dramatist is more doubtful.
