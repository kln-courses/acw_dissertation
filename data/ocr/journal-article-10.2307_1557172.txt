<plain_text><page sequence="1">e e4 wj4 Volume 8 July-October 1968 Numbers 3 and 4 JERVIS McENTEE'S DIARY The art world of today is so different from that of the late 19th century that it is difficult for us to comprehend the problems a painter of moderate reputa- tion faced. There were, for example, no more than five or six dealers in New York in the 1870's and even these operated to a large degree through a system of periodic auction sales. Most collectors bought their pictures from these sales, from exhibitions held by the National Academy of Design, or, the most common procedure, directly from the artist himself. This arrange- ment forced the artist to cultivate his own market. A few fortunate ones developed strong patrons. William H. Osborn bought heavily from Frederic E. Church and Robert M. Olyphant from John Kensett. Most artists, even the well established ones, anxiously courted the small community of collectors. This situation gave the National Academy and clubs like the Century and the Union League a position of enormous influence in the lives of artists. Members of the Academy were assured of space in its exhibitions. The clubs regularly showed works by their artist members and other club members were the people who bought pictures. In the 1870's and 1880's the new rich began to buy respectability and sophistication through European rather than American art. The works of such well- known figures as Bierstadt, Church, Gifford, and Eastman Johnson continued in demand, but less pop- ular men suffered. This decline in the market for American pictures, together with the threatening in- novative work of younger painters like William Merritt Chase, drove the older artists into the increasingly defensive posture which the Hudson River School painter Jervis McEntee so poignantly expresses in a diary kept during the last third of his life. McEntee was born at Rondout, New York, in 1828. In the winter of 1850-51 he studied under Frederic E. Church, with whom he maintained a close relationship for the rest of his life. Later, after an unsuccessful at- tempt at a business career, he took a studio in New York and in 1861 he was elected to the National Academy. His chief subject was the autumn landscape, to which he applied subdued colors and melancholy effects. Never widely popular, his work sold slowly yet with a certain consistent steadiness. McEntee's diary begins in May 1872 and ends a few months before its author's death in 1891. If the prose style is not that of a practiced writer, it is adequate for its purpose: "A brief record of each day and often good for reference." It is also serviceable enough to give the historian a clear and comprehensive view of a typical artist's life in New York. For McEntee was thoroughly typical. With his years of service on the National Academy's Council, his third of a century's residence in the Tenth Street Studio Building, his active participation in the Century Club, his circle of acquaintances among painters and collectors, he stood at the center of the art world. His closest friends, Sanford Gifford, Eastman Johnson, Worthington Whittredge, John F. Weir, and Edwin Booth, were men with distinguished reputations. His acquaintances included such disparate personages as Mrs. George Armstrong Custer, John Hay, Frederick Law Olmsted, William Cullen Bryant, and Mary Mapes Dodge. Indeed, he was such an incurable name dropper to his journal that in spite of his cry, "Some- times I wonder why I keep this diary," one suspects he anticipated its eventual publication. Like those of most New York artists, McEntee's life followed a routine seasonal pattern. In late spring he left the city for his father's place at Rondout, now a part of Kingston, a port on the Hudson. Summer was devoted to leisure, to fishing, rides and excursions, and to desultory painting. Each fall he spent a few weeks sketching in the Catskills or the Maine woods. In November or December he returned to New York, where he painted from sketches made during the previous months. Creative work, however, was only one of several activities. He visited studios and received artists and buyers in his own. He enjoyed concerts and the theatre 1</page><page sequence="2">Jervis McEntee (ca.1864) 2</page><page sequence="3">and small dinner parties. Larger social affairs were burdens he often submitted to. The Century Club, composed of artists and writers and cultivated business and professional men, was a focal point in his life and he seldom missed its monthly meetings, which usually included an exhibition of paintings. The great annual event of the art world, the National Academy exhibition, invariably produced some degree of euphoria or depression in his spirits. In 1854 McEntee married Gertrude Sawyer, the daughter of a noted Universalist clergyman. He was greatly attached to his immediate family, particularly to his sisters Sara and Mary and to the latter's husband Calvert Vaux and their four children. The McEntees went to Europe with Sanford Gifford in 1868 and spent that winter in Rome. A severe case of pneumonia con- tracted two years later lingered on for many weeks. The diary begins a short time after his recovery. Tuesday, May 14, 1872. Buchanan ReadI died at the Astor House on Saturday. He had just arrived from Europe and was taken ill with pleuro pneumonia on board the vessel when only a short time out and the papers say suffered greatly. There was a long obituary notice in the Tribune yesterday written in a very kindly spirit in which he was spoken of as having come home to recuperate from the exhausting pursuit of his profession and dwelling upon his social qualities at some length. He and Mozier2 were leaders in the American society in Rome and now that they are both gone undoubtedly their loss will be very sensibly felt there. I did not know Read very intimately. I counted much on his friendship and society when I went to Rome, but his first call upon us at our hotel surprised and saddened me. Church3 and his wife happened to be calling on us and they were equally shocked for he was so intoxicated as to be very silly and Gifford4 got him up to his room where he remained, with his man Antonio waiting in the office for him until the clerk sent up word that he wanted to shut up the house for the night. His habits were very bad the winter we were in Rome, and I understood that he was involved in all sorts of financial difficulties. I know while we were there that Mr. Jessup of Philadelphia helped him to some money under promise of a reformation. When I heard he was so ill with pneumonia in New York I made up my mind he would die, for my experience proved to me that one needs all the force of a good constitution and a temperate mode of life to recover from a severe attack of this disease. The impression that I got of Read that winter was that he was a man of considerable pretense, and vanity accompanied by a kind amiable heart. He was fond of showing the extent of his apartments as he did once to Gifford from the piazza, adding, "There's nothing slovenly about that is there?" Some very ordinary carved furniture in his studio he showed with great pride, adding, "There's a history attached to each piece." He gave large entertainments when I knew he could ill afford them and his poor little wife betrayed her anxiety about him constantly in spite of herself. I am glad to know his wife was with him during his illness. His remains were taken to Germantown near Philadelphia for interment today, and Mr. Childs5 and Bayard Taylor6 are to assist. Poor man! He is another example of a career cut short by imprudence. I have no doubt had he been a tem- perate man he would still be living. Thursday, May 16. I received a letter from Boughton7 last night dated Apl. 30 the evening of varnishing day at the Royal Academy. One of my pictures the November was in, on the line in a good room and looked nicely. The other one he could not find and it was either hung up out of sight or rejected. Four thousand pictures were rejected, Bradford's8 white bear picture among the rest, a large picture of Bier- stadt's,9 Farrer's1o oil pictures, while his water colors were put on the line. La Farge's11 large picture was rejected and his flowers hung high and in a corner. Innessl2 1. Thomas Buchanan Read (1822-1872), a poet and painter who settled in Rome after the Civil War, is best known today as the author of Sheridan's Ride. He was a short, slight man noted for his energy and charm. 2. Joseph Mozier (1812-1870) abandoned a business career in New York to study sculpture. In 1845 he established himself in Rome where he stayed for the rest of his life. 3. Frederic Edwin Church (1826-1900). A student under Thomas Cole in the 1840's, Church achieved a reputation as a landscape painter of great dramatic power which is still secure. He was McEntee's teacher in 1850 and is the subject of frequent, usually respectful references in the diary. 4. Sanford Robinson Gifford (1823-1880). A landscape painter, one of the best of the Hudson River School, and McEntee's closest friend. In a letter to his father from Rome, he mentions, without comment, this same meeting with Read: "In the eve(ning] the Churches and T. Buchanan Read called." 5. George William Childs (1829-1894), a notable Philadelphia publisher and friend of Read's. 6. Bayard Taylor (1825-1878). One of McEntee's closest friends and an important New York writer and literary influence in the 1860's and 1870's. 7. George Henry Boughton (1833-1905). A landscape and figure painter who lived briefly in New York, studied in Paris, and after 1861 settled in London where McEntee and Gifford visited him in 1868. 8. William Bradford (1823-1892), a popular marine artist who enjoyed the patronage of rich English ladies, among them Queen Victoria. 9. Albert Bierstadt (1830-1902). An enormously successful landscape painter, Bierstadt is best known for his large dramatic scenes of the Rocky Mountains and the Yosemite Valley. 10. Henry Farrer (1843-1903) came to New York from England in 1863, painted in oils and water colors, and in later years con- centrated on etchings. 11. John La Farge (1835-1910). Son of a rich and cultivated family, La Farge was a truly cosmopolitan figure in the American art world of the late 19th century. He kept a studio at 51 West 10th Street, but McEntee mentions him infrequently. 12. George Inness (1825-1894), one of the few late 19th century American painters whose reputation today is as high as it was in his lifetime. 3</page><page sequence="4">"skied," Hennessy13 ditto and one out; so among so many dead and wounded I have done well. Boughton's three pictures, each parts of a whole are hung together on the line and form a contre so that he could not have been better treated. Tuesday, June II. Last evening Gertrude and I re- turned from New York where we went three weeks ago today. During my absence I finished the picture "Kaatskill Woods" which Mr. Hoe14 bought of me while I was sick, besides a picture for Dr. Dunning15 and another Kaatskill brook which I laid in two years ago and which I intend for Mr. Chickering.16 We attended the unveiling of Ward's17 statue of Shake- speare, one of the most artistic festivals ever held in this country, visited the Art Museum18 for the first time, and saw Turner's "Slave Ship" which I enjoyed as the bold expression of a great artist and as a piece of full rich color, but which is entirely outside of criticism from a naturalistic point of view. We spent an evening quietly with Bayard Taylor and his wife, and they one with us. Dined at Dr. Drapers,19 at Averys,20 at Vaux's21 and at Eastman Johnson's22 in his new city house in 55th St. The Taylors sailed in the Hamburg steamer Westphalia June 6. Thompson23 and I went over to see them off. Mrs. Taylor was a little sad, but Taylor was as always in fine spirits. On our way back to N.Y. we called at the Cooks24 in Hoboken and saw them all. The weather all the while we were in the city was cool and pleasant and next year I think I would like to remain there until June 1. The Durand25 picnic came off Saturday, June 8 and was a perfect success. It had rained in the morning but cleared off before it was time for us to go but the woods were so wet that we had our table spread on the wide veranda of his house where we remained the whole day and every one seemed to enjoy it to the utmost. Nearly all came who promised to. Mr. Bryant26 came all the way from Roslyn in spite of the threatening weather. I was sure he would come if it were possible, and he seemed to enjoy the occasion exceedingly and made a nice little address at the lunch table. Palmer27 and his wife came all the way from Albany. Kensett28 was there with a young Philadelphia lady. Gifford and his sister Mary, Whittredge29 and his wife, Cranch,30 Geo. Hall,31 Wm. Hart32 and wife, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Hicks,33 Hub- bard,34 Mr. &amp; Mrs. David Johnson,35 Mr. &amp; Mrs. Eastman Johnson, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Page,36 Ward, Fal- 13. William John Hennessy (1839-1917), a prolific genre and land- scape painter and an illustrator of works by English and American poets. After 1870 he lived in England and France. 14. Robert Hoe (d.1884). Together with his brother Richard M., Robert Hoe was a prosperous manufacturer of printing presses and a prominent art collector. 15. Edwin James Dunning (1821-1901), a dentist, writer, and art collector. 16. George H. Chickering, a member of the Boston piano manu- facturing family, assembled a considerable art collection in the 1870's and 1880's. 17. John Quincy Adams Ward (1830-1910), one of the best known of the late 19th century American sculptors and an active leader in art organizations. 18. The Metropolitan Museum of Art was incorporated in 1870 and opened to the public in its first temporary building at Fifth Avenue between 53rd and 54th Streets on February 22, 1872. Turner's Slave Ship was lent to the museum by its first president, John Taylor Johnston. 19. John William Draper (1811-1882), chemist, physiologist, pioneer photographer, historian, and a passenger in 1868 with McEntee and Gifford on their trip to Europe. 20. Samuel Putnam Avery (1822-1904). An influential New York dealer and connoisseur, Avery advised the newly rich collectors of the post Civil War period on the formation of their galleries. His promotion of European art later led McEntee to regard him with bitter distrust. 21. Calvert Vaux (1824-1895), husband of McEntee's sister Mary and a well-known architect of the period. Together with Frederick Law Olmsted, Vaux designed Central Park and was the initial architect for the Metropolitan Museum building. 22. Eastman Johnson (1824-1906), one of the best known American painters of the post Civil War period and McEntee's close friend. 23. Launt Thompson (1833-1894), an important late 19th century sculptor whose later years, as seen in McEntee's diary, were blighted by excessive drinking. 24. Family friends of the McEntees, the Cook household consisted of Martha Elizabeth Duncan Walker Cook (1806-1874), a writer and ardent friend of Poland, her daughter Edith Cook, a painter, and an otherwise unidentified Mrs. Pychowska. 25. Asher Brown Durand (1796-1886). In 1848 McEntee's first choice for an art teacher was Durand, after Thomas Cole the painter most closely identified with the Hudson River School. The picnic here described was initiated by McEntee and is re- ferred to at length in John Durand's biography of his father. 26. William Cullen Bryant (1794-1878). The great editor and nature poet had been Durand's close friend for well over forty years in 1872. 27. Erastus Dow Palmer (1817-1904), a celebrated and influential sculptor, lived most of his life in Albany. 28. John Frederick Kensett (1816-1872). One of the best of the Hudson River School painters, Kensett contracted pneumonia a few months after the picnic following a vain attempt to save the drowning wife of the painter Vincent Colyer at Darien, Connecticut. 29. Worthington Whittredge (1820-1910), another Hudson River School painter and close friend of McEntee's, is frequently mentioned in the diary. 30. Christopher Pearse Cranch (1813-1892), a Unitarian minister and Boston Transcendentalist turned poet and landscape painter. 31. George Henry Hall (1825-1913), a popular figure and still-life painter who traveled much abroad and exhibited regularly at the National Academy of Design for over forty years. 32. William Hart (1823-1894). Beginning as an itinerant portrait painter, Hart made his reputation in landscapes and became a leader in such organizations as the Brooklyn Academy of Design and the American Society of Water Colorists. 33. Thomas Hicks (1823-1890), a portrait painter who specialized in writers and politicians. 34. Richard William Hubbard (1816-1888), a popular Hudson River School painter notable for the modest serenity of his nature scenes. 35. David Johnson (1827-1908), landscape painter who studied under Jasper Cropsey. 36. William Page (1811-1885). Page was considered one of the most significant American artists in the 1850's and 1860's, but the following decade saw him slipping into obscurity from which he never fully recovered. He was president of the National Academy of Design from 1871 to 1873. 4</page><page sequence="5">coner,37 Vollmering,38 Brevoort39 and Miss Bascom, besides all Mr. Durand's and Mr. Woodman's40 fam- ilies and a Miss Hasbrouck and Miss Peck visiting there. Mr. Durand acknowledged the compliment in a speech which showed how deeply he was touched by this remembrance of the Artists. It was a most satisfactory day and I shall always remember with gratification that my suggestion was so heartily re- sponded to and that we were able to show in so fitting a way our veneration for the old man. I received a letter from John Durand41 just before I left the city in which he told me the affair had had the happiest effect on his father. He had walked nearly over the Orange Mountain and was in the best of spirits. My greatest satisfaction is in the happiness it has afforded him. Tuesday, June 18. Nett42 sang in the parlor in the evening. She seems thoroughly artistic and has a proper estimate of an artist's obligations. Dresses simply, is unconventional, likes recognition and thinks more of Art than of money. Sunday, June 30. I had a letter from Boughton two or three days ago. He and his wife had been on the continent for a short trip. He sent me that same notice in the Times43 which three others have sent me and regrets that my picture is not sold. Thinks I ask too much for it and that English people will not pay large prices for works by strangers. I am a little sorry I had not asked a little less but still I didn't care to sacrifice much on it as I am quite sure to get my price for it in New York next winter. The other picture he says he will send to the Dudley Gallery. He spoke of Avery's being there and of an excursion or two they had made together. He is full of work and has more commissions than he can paint. Saturday, July 6. I received a letter from Mr. Fair- banks44 yesterday in which he declined to take my "Venice" which I offered him for $900. I got my painting materials together today and went to work in our room. I made a little study for the picture I am to paint for Mr. Dorman.45 It is inconvenient painting here as the sun comes in in the afternoon. I had intended to have my little studio completed if Mr. Fairbanks had taken my picture and perhaps I may have it done still later in the season, but I cannot bear to go in debt for it. The fact is I am very unhappy and very disinclined to do anything. Every- thing looks like a great undertaking even the most trivial affair and I find the summer going away without accomplishing much. Whether it is owing to the fact that I have not entirely regained my health or whether I am gradually losing my energy and hopefulness I can hardly tell, but I am afraid this constant worry about money affairs is having its effect to discourage me. Every summer it is the same. I am tied fast for the want of a little money. I think I must begin now to lay my plans for another year and if possible go somewhere where I can be at work all the time. Monday, July 8. I began Mr. Dorman's picture today a variation of the little view on "Spruce Creek" with the fallen leaves (size 20 x 24). While I was at work on it I received a letter from him from Northampton telling me he did not care for it before November . . . . The summer seems to culminate with the ripening of the grass and the grain, and it saddens me to find that I am looking forward to the Autumn. Some spirit of unrest and melancholy has hold of me and controls me against my will. Sunday, July 14. I am forty-four years old today, nearer I hope to some of the objects at which I have aimed in life and yet how far from much that one could desire. Sometimes I doubt if an artistic tem- perament is compatible with the happiest and serenest life, for while the satisfactions are often great how many inexpressible longings there are which will not shape themselves. Thursday, July 18. I . . . received a letter from Dorman the tenor of which shows me how exceedingly difficult it will be for me to satisfy him with a picture. He is so afraid he won't get the very best 37. John M. Falconer (1820-1903), a portrait, landscape and genre painter who came to New York from England in the 1840's. 38. Joseph Vollmering (1810-1887), portrait and landscape painter who left Germany at the age of thirty-seven and exhibited often at the National Academy. 39. James Renwick Brevoort (1832-1918), a figure and landscape painter and member of the National Academy for more than fifty-seven years. Brevoort taught at the Academy school and in April 1873 married Marie Louise Bascom, one of his students, who won the first medal awarded by the school. 40. Durand's daughter Lucy, herself a painter, married George Woodman, a New York lawyer, about 1850. 41. John Durand (1822-1908), son of Asher B. Durand, co-editor of The Crayon, an influential mid-19th century art journal, and author of The Life and Times of A. B. Durand. 42. Antoinette Sterling (1850-1904) was a contralto who studied from 1868 to 1871 and settled permanently in England in 1873. Essentially a ballad singer, she had a very earnest manner and a voice of great beauty. 43. London Times, May 27, 1872, quoted in an unidentified clipping pasted in the diary at the entry for June 23: A new name, Jervis McEntee, attached to a landscape (930) of unpretending but rare quality - "November," with the appropriate line, "Shade deepening over shade the country round embrowns" is, we understand, American. The picture shows what is so rare, an imaginative feeling of the subject - a scene of low hills with a foreground of scrubby wood- land, its winter suit of brown here and there enlivened, but very sparingly, with a touch of autumnal scarlet and gold, and a horizon of higher hills of sombre indigo. The picture is too low in tone and too sombre in sentiment to attract much attention; but it deserves and will reward study, and affixes a mark in the memory to the artist's name. 44. Horace Fairbanks, a manufacturer cf scales in New York and a collector of American painting. 45. Probably E. E. Dorman, a collector of American painting. 5</page><page sequence="6">CA JERVIS McENTEE, Skating in the Catskills near Rondout, N.Y.

I want to paint a good picture and then if he does not take it it will not be my fault. Vaux sent me a check for $50 on account of his picture which was very obliging of him as he was not obliged to pay it now. Monday, July 22. Vaux, Mary, Gertrude, Marian, Lorry Stoddard46 and I went up to Church's by the 10:40 train and returned in the evening. It was a magnificent day, the wind blowing freshly from the Northwest. After a nice dinner at his little cottage we went up to his new house47 which approaches completion. The upper story is plastered and I believe they intend to get into it this fall. It is certainly a beautiful house and commands one of the finest views of river and mountain in the country. Church devotes nearly his whole time to building his house, and with his peculiar talent has produced a satisfactory result. The color of the house on the outside by the judicious use of colored bricks with the stone is very harmonious and agreeable. It looks like an artist's work. Monday, August 26. It is a month today since I left home for the sea coast. I joined Gifford and Whittredge in Hudson and the following morning (July 30) we left for Gloucester where we arrived the same evening. After staying a day or two at the hotel we got board at Mr. Abm. Day's where Gifford and Whittredge had staid before and where we were very comfortable. I remained there until Monday Aug. 19 when I left for Boston ... I remained here until Wednesday morning when I went to Nantucket via Woods Hole to visit Eastman Johnson. Arrived there about six o'clock in the evening and found him on the dock waiting for me. I staid with him until Friday morning when I left for N.Y. . ... I don't think I have gained specially in health by my sea side experience. I enjoyed it but to be candid not over much. The coast and the whole region about Gloucester are very interesting but the whole thing was so new to me that it would take a longer time for me to get into entire sympathy with it. I made about twenty small sketches (I only took my small box) but it is doubtful whether I will ever use any of them. I found Eastman very nicely situated in his home at Nantucket. The house and all its surroundings are very plain. All the furniture is what he has picked up there and he has no carpets and no useless furniture but it is very pleasant and cosy. He has a good large studio and had one fine study which he had made up in the town; a grape arbor with hollyhocks. We took a walk thro' a part of the quaint old town and I should have liked to have staid longer and seen more of this very peculiar place. Numbers of people are beginning to go there now and in a year or two I dare say it will be a regular watering place. Wednesday, Sept. 11. Received a letter from Mr. Dorman yesterday in which he informs me that the picture does not quite please him, which is as I expected. I wish I were independent of such men. At least I shall not paint him another. Sunday, Oct. 20. We left for the mountains Monday Sept. 16 and returned Wednesday Oct. 16 having been gone a little over four weeks. We staid at the Laurel House48 as last year. Vaux came up and spent a couple of weeks . . . Vaux's business called him home sooner than he had hoped and he left with regret. I think he very much needed rest and recreation. Gifford came after we had been there some time and Mary Gifford and Sallie Wilkinson also came for a couple of weeks and remained until we came home. Whittredge and his wife meanwhile were at Scribner's where we left them. The weather was most unfavorable during the most of our stay, frequent rains and some gloomy skies. The foliage was not nearly as brilliant as usual and the color was at its height a day or two before we left, about the 12th to 15th. It was so cold that I could not sit out of doors much of the time and so I did not get as much as I had hoped, still I made three or four studies which will be useful to me. As it was, I exposed myself painting in the woods one cold day and caught a cold which clings to me yet. Many more people visit the mountains in October than heretofore. Last year we were the only ones at the Laurel House and this year parties kept coming and going all the time we were there so that there were constantly from ten to twenty-five people in the house. I am afraid that our quiet times there are at an end and that the number of guests will increase in the fall from year to year. We left in the nick of time for the weather has continued the same until today which is bright and still but cold. Whittredge thought he would leave on Tuesday next but I would not be surprised if he had already gone .... Since I came home I have painted a little study of a fog effect from "Sunset Rock" and commenced a picture of the wood interior on the Mountain House49 path, same size as the study, 16 x 22, and after painting two days on it abandoned it and began a new 46.

Olana, Church's house near Hudson, New York was designed in part by Calvert Vaux and by Richard Morris Hunt. Now preserved by the New York State Historic Trust, it commands a dramatic view of the Hudson River and of the Catskills beyond. 48. A resort hotel, cheaper and less elegant than its more famous neighbor the Mountain House, the Laurel House was built in 1847 at Kaaterskill Falls in the Catskills. 49. A large and fashionable resort hotel in the Catskills which opened in 1824, still received guests as late as 1942, and burned in 1963. 7</page><page sequence="8">one on Saturday which is a little more promising. We expect to go down to the city about the 6th of Nov. and I am anxious to get two or three things ready before I go. Sunday, October 27. Gertrude and I went up to Mr. Gifford's in Hudson on Thursday and returned last evening . . . . Mrs. Church sent up for us in the rain to come and spend Sunday with them, but as we had arranged to go home we were obliged to decline what would have been a pleasure to each of us. I think Mrs. Church must be lonely there and long for some congenial companion. I find that one's wife or one's husband, however happy in each other's com- panionship, is not sufficient. The interests are too identical and another element, with a new set of interests and ideas, is necessary to give a flavor to life. Sunday, Nov. 10. We left Rondout and came to New York for the winter on Thursday Nov. 7 . . . . A Mr. Sullivan50 called who had come here about six weeks ago with an English gentleman who wanted to buy one of my pictures. He enquired the price of the Chickering picture and also the one I painted for Dorman and is going to write to him. Since the election people talk encouragingly about business and predict a prosperous season for Art. The Belmont51 collection is offered for sale. I went to see it yesterday but he has withheld his best pictures and yet it is cried up in the papers as one of the greatest collections ever offered here. Derby52 has hired the Academy for an exhibition and sale of foreign Art and foreign pictures are pouring in in a perfect deluge. There seems no place for us but I hope it will be good for us in some way. I took Gertrude over to Vaux's last evening and then went to the Century where I met a number of acquaintances. I talked nearly all the evening with Freeman53 the artist of Rome who has taken a studio here for the winter. He told me that C. C. Coleman54 sailed for Europe yesterday. Tuesday, Nov 12. I received a letter from Sellstedt55 in relation to my picture the "Danger Signal" now in Buffalo. He thinks they may buy it for their Academy but could say nothing definite about it. I wrote him I would sell it to them for $1000 and if he thought it would be to my advantage to leave it there a little longer I would do so. Gertrude and I called at Avery's yesterday. He has just returned from Europe and seemed to have brought home a very poor lot of pictures. We also went up to Goupils56 to see Gerome's57 Cleopatra before Caesar. Gerome has the dramatic talent in a greater degree than the Artistic but I think him a very great man while I do not fully like his manner of working. His pictures are too elaborate but he never fails to transport me to the age he paints. I walked over to Vaux's this evening. Mr. Putnam58 came in. He told me there was a quiet movement on foot to send a collection of American pictures to the Vienna Exposition.59 It is expected that Congress will make an appropriation in the opening of the session. Thursday, Nov. 14. Weir60 gave a dinner in Gifford's room to Fitch,61 Whittredge, Hubbard, Gifford and myself after which we all except Fitch went over to Brooklyn to hear Weir's lecture on color before the Brooklyn Art Association.62 It has rained today and I have painted on my Pine Tree picture changing the tone of it. . . . This evening directly after dinner I went up to see Kensett who I heard was ill. I was greatly alarmed to find he is seriously ill with pneumonia. I could not see him but was told by Hicks that he is doing well. He has Allopathic physicians but I was glad they had sent for Dr. Otis63 in whom I have every confidence. I could only offer my services and told them to call on me for anything I could do. Saturday, Nov. 16. Mr. Hoe came in yesterday morn- ing and I made a trade with him giving him my 50. Possibly H. Wood Sullivan, a Brooklyn art collector of the 1870's and 1880's. 51. August Belmont (1816-1890), banker, political personage, and patron of the arts. The catalogue of the 1872 sale bears out McEntee's comment. 52. H. W. Derby, a dealer who imported works of contemporary art from Europe. His activities paralleled but were less successful than Avery's. 53. James Edwards Freeman (1808-1884), a genre painter, was elected a National Academician in 1833 and three years later moved to Rome where he stayed for the rest of his life. 54. Charles Caryl Coleman (1840-1928), figure and landscape painter and another life-long expatriate in Italy. 55. Lars Gustaf Sellstedt (1819-1911). A sailor with a talent for painting, Sellstedt lived most of his life in Buffalo where he produced portraits and figure studies and was active in local art organizations. 56. A New York branch of Goupil et Cie., Parisian engravers and print sellers, was opened in 1846 by Michael Knoedler. In 1857 Knoedler established his own firm, M. Knoedler &amp; Co., which continued to operate a Goupil Gallery. 57. Jean Leon Gerome (1824-1904), famous French academic painter and teacher at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. 58. George Palmer Putnam (1814-1872), notable publisher, friend of American writers, and patron of the arts. 59. An international art exhibition held in Vienna in 1873. 60. John Ferguson Weir (1841-1926). Member of a family of artists and one of the important painters of his time, Weir served as Director and professor at the Yale School of Fine Arts for many years. He was one of McEntee's intimate friends, although the diarist disapproved of his later experiments with "new methods." 61. John Lee Fitch (1836-1895), landscape painter who settled in New York in 1866. 62. The Brooklyn Art Association was established in 1861 for "the encouragement and promotion of Art, by a reunion of the mem- bers at a monthly meeting, by providing for the exhibition of Paintings, Statuary and other works of Art, by an inauguration of one or more annual exhibitions, and ultimately by the estab- lishment of a permanent Gallery." 63. Fessenden Nott Otis (1825-1900), a well-known physician and medical lecturer in New York. He studied landscape drawing in his early years and published several books on the subject. 8</page><page sequence="9">picture of Venice and agreeing to paint him one like Mr. Chickering's picture for the picture of Kaatskill woods I sold him last spring and two hundred dollars. I do not furnish frames for either. I consider this a good trade for I exchange a picture I have had some time and not a saleable subject for a picture which seemed to be very popular when it was first painted. ... Whittredge gave Gertrude Leutze's64 portrait of me and today we brought it down to her. Friday, Nov. 22. Wednesday evening I dined at Fitch's with Weir, H. K. Brown,65 Thompson, Gifford, Hubbard and Whittredge. . . . Last night . . . I sat up with Kensett who is ill with pneumonia but not so ill as I was. He is recovering rapidly. Today I wrote to Mr. Hamilton,66 to Sellstedt to return my Danger Signal, to Mr. Chickering that his picture was ready for him. Sunday, Nov 24. Friday Fitch invited Gifford and my wife and I to go and see Miss Neilson67 in Juliet at Booth's Theatre. Gifford invited us to dine in his room. . . . Miss Neilson struck me as a good actress but by no means a genius. She was best in the quiet parts but was not good in the emotional passages. My picture is back from London and in my studio again and looks as well as ever to me. I have been repainting my "October in the Kaatskills" and have made as I think a fine picture of it. I repainted the landscape which I found made a different sky necessary and I succeeded in painting a very nice toned grey sky. Unfortunately the canvas was cracked by rolling it up to send it to me and the cracks show in the sky. It wouldn't trouble me but a purchaser might object to it. Eastman Johnson came in for a moment on Friday evening having just got back to town from Nantucket. Gertrude and I went up to his house last evening and saw all his studies and pictures. He has been very industrious and has done many good things. Thursday, Nov. 28. I watched with Kensett last night. He slept nearly the whole night and is getting well fast. I wrote to Hamilton last week to come and see two pictures I have and told him I would abate somewhat from my price if he cared to buy. My letter reached him in the midst of the "North West" excitement68 in Wall St., but he wrote me he would call and see me as soon as he could find time. I have determined to sell my pictures at reduced prices and those that are not so popular at considerably less. Having de- termined upon this I feel relieved and can do it now easily. Someone sent me a copy of the London Times with a short but favorable notice of my October Snow now in the Dudley Gallery. I wrote Mr. Chickering to come and see his picture. He does not expect to be in New York this winter and asked if I would object to sending the picture to him by express and give him the privelege of returning it at his expense if he chose. I have written to him declining to do so. My first impulse was to do it but on reflecting I see many objections to it. Tuesday night I painted a sketch of Gertrude at the carved cabinet by gaslight which is pretty good. I would like to practise figures and am thinking of doing something at it. I think if I could arrange to do so next summer it would add greatly to my happiness and open up a new and attractive field to me. I feel that I could succeed in it after a while and shall consider it seriously. Wednesday, Dec. 4. Mr. Greeley's funeral69 took place today. Mary, Gertrude and I went out into 5th Avenue to see the procession pass but they finally went up to Mrs. Youmans'70 while I remained on the sidewalk. President Grant was in one of the carriages and I recognized Whitelaw Reid,71 Mr. Ripley72 and Miss Nelly Hutchinson.73 No private citizen ever had such honors paid to him before. Avery hearing that my picture had come back from England asked me to let him have it at his rooms a few days and today I sent it to him. We went to Mr. Robert Hoe's to tea last evening and had a delightful time. Robert Hoe, Jr.74 and his wife were there. Mr. Hoe was very hospitable and his house which has recently been refitted and refurnished was very tasteful and elegant. They gave us a delicious supper and showed us every 64. Emanuel Leutze (1816-1868), a historical and portrait painter, influential in his day and best known now for his Washington Crossing the Delaware. 65. Henry Kirke Brown (1814-1886) turned from painting to sculpture in 1836, spent four years in Italy and later settled in New York where he produced portrait busts and Indian and animal groups. He was one of the first American sculptors to break with the neo-classical school popular in the mid-19th century. 66. Probably William H. Hamilton, a business man and active collector. 67. Adelaide Neilson (c.1851-1890), Mrs. Philip Henry Lee, was born in England and made her debut at Booth's Opera House in 1872. "A most gorgeous young woman," the diarist George Templeton Strong called her. 68. An attempt by Jay Gould to corner Northwestern Railroad stock. 69. Greeley's defeat for the presidency after an unusually bitter campaign was followed almost immediately by his death. His funeral was one of the dramatic public events of the 1870's. 70. Catherine E. Newton of Albany was first married to William Little Lee, leading jurist in the Hawaiian kingdom, and after his death to Edward Livingston Youmans, writer and editor of popular works on science. 71. Whitelaw Reid (1837-1912), influential journalist and editor who joined the New York Tribune in 1868 and become editor on Greeley's death. 72. George Ripley (1802-1880), writer and reformer who served for many years as literary critic for the Tribune. 73. Known as the "spicy little reporter," Miss Hutchinson was a journalist on Greeley's New York Tribune who often wrote on woman's suffrage. 74. Robert Hoe, Jr. (1839-1909) became the head of the family printing press firm in 1886. He was an art patron and one of the greatest American bibliophiles. 9</page><page sequence="10">attention in their power. Mr. Hoe invited me to go up to his country place on Friday (at Tarrytown), to spend the day. Eastman Johnson and his wife came to see us while we were out last night. I went up and called on him this afternoon. Had a note from Mr. Chickering in which he tells me he is considering about letting me have a semigrand piano and will write me in a day or two. . . . I called on Kensett who was out walking yesterday. There I met Walter Brown75 who returned with his family from Europe about a month ago. From there I went and called on Thompson and on Miller.76 La Farge and Butler77 were out. When I returned to my studio I found Vaux there with Mr. Howard78 from Springfield whom he brought to see my pictures with a view of buying something. He seemed inclined to take the Kaatskill Woods but did not want to decide until he went home and measured the place to see how it would fill it. Thursday, Dec. 5. Mr. Hoe called for me at half past 8 with his carriage to take me to the train for his place at Tarrytown. We spent a very pleasant day there going about his place, had a nice lunch at his house, and came home in the afternoon bringing a beautiful basket of flowers from his green house for Gertrude. He was very genial and hospitable and we had a nice friendly talk together. I think he is a kind, excellent man and he seems much interested in me and glad to be of any service he can. He told me that Boughton's Royal Acadmy series of three pictures was at Goupils which he liked very much and wanted me to go and see them. On our way down to the studio we stopped in and saw them. I had advised him to buy them telling him I thought the price ($7000) reason- able. When we got there he expressed great satisfaction in them and when he learned that they had been sold to Mr. Jesup79 I think he was a little regretful that he had not secured them. He certainly has a very nice feeling and appreciates genuine sentiment. I liked the pictures very much, but after all how seldom an artist does a new thing. In analysing these pictures I see the same face and figure Boughton has painted so many times and even the same quaint long dress, but of a different color, and in the gallery I heard a man remarking on this same face. In spite of that I had rather have them than any pictures I have seen for a long time. I found a letter from Taylor full of troubles and disappointments, but of a brave temper. I had a feeling he had been flying from anxieties that would be pretty apt to follow him. Sunday, Dec. 8. The monthly meeting of the Century occurred last night. Thompson and I hung the pictures in the afternoon. Winslow Homerso had a capital picture of "Snap the Whip" full of daylight and character. Mr. Blackburn81 of London was there, editor of London Society. He took me up to my little picture (Mr. Chickering's) and said he considered that the best picture in the room and the one showing the best feeling (not knowing whose it was). I don't know what his judgment is worth but he showed good sense in his criticisms. The proposition to increase the number of members to six hundred was lost. I voted in the negative. I was put on the committee on nominations for this year. Stanley82 was there. I hear his lectures are a dead failure, to my great surprise. Thursday, Dec. 12. A Mr. Ogden83 called on me on Tuesday and wanted to buy a picture. He said he would send his wife to look at the one I painted for Mr. Dorman. On Wednesday Mr. De Forest84 called. He told me his sister-in-law wanted to buy an im- portant picture and he would get her to come and look at my "October." I repainted the sky yesterday entirely covering the cracks and I think much im- proving the picture. I have been at work most of the week on the picture for Mr. Hoe which is about done. Today I began a sea picture. Sunday, Dec. 15. Whittredge came yesterday bring- ing a Scotch gentleman and his sister and a lady friend. They seemed much interested in my pictures and other things in the room. While they were here Russell the carman called me to the door to inform me that Kensett was dead! Kensett whom we had all supposed was almost well again. . . . Immediately after dinner I went up to Kensett's where I found the two Mr. Olyphants85 and David Johnson. Johnson told me 75. Walter Brown (d.1879). A merchant and art collector, Brown also kept a studio and exhibited his own works at the National Academy. 76. Charles Henry Miller (1842-1922), a physician turned artist, but still comparatively unknown in 1872. 77. George Bernard Butler, Jr. (1838-1907). Best known for his animal pictures, Butler was elected to the National Academy in 1873 and two years later moved to Italy. 78. George E. Howard, a Springfield, Massachusetts, collector. 79. Morris K. Jesup (1830-1908), merchant, banker, and philan- thropist who served as vice-president of the Society for the Suppression of Vice, was a member of the Century Club, and an active art collector. 80. Winslow Homer (1836-1910) kept a studio in the Studio Build- ing at this time, but there are few references to him in the diary. 81. Henry Blackburn (1830-1897), English writer on art and editor of London Society and, after 1875, of Academy Notes. 82. Henry Morton Stanley (1841-1904) had only recently returned from finding Dr. Livingston in Africa. 83. William Butler Ogden (1805-1877) made a fortune in Chicago real estate and railroad development before settling in New York in 1866. 84. Henry Grant De Forest (d.1889), a socially prominent patron of the arts. 85. Robert Morrison Olyphant (1824-1918), a merchant and art collector who specialized in Kensetts and owned at least one of McEntee's works. His brother, G. Talbot Olyphant, was also a collector. 10</page><page sequence="11">that about 1 o'clock he had been in to see Kensett and he was in his usual health and spirits. Talked about getting a new carpet for his room like John- son's and wanted him to send him in a piece of it and spoke of his avidity to go to painting. He (Johnson) left to go to his lunch and came back in half an hour to find him sitting on his sofa dead. His physicians say that he died of apoplexy and that his death was sudden and painless. But to think of Kensett, loved of so many, dying alone. While I was there two gentlemen came in and after a short con- versation with Mr. Olyphant they went into the next room to see the body. When they came out Mr. Olyphant told me that the elder was Kensett's brother who lives in Baltimore. Sadly enough he had been in the city for two days, but very busy, and knowing his brother was almost well he had set apart today to go and visit him. The first intimation he had of this event was the return of the telegram sent to him at Baltimore. I went in to see all that was left of the genial Kensett, the body without the soul saddest spectacle in life. He lay on the sofa where he died, but it had been removed to the little room adjoining his sitting room. I was entirely overcome by the sight in such sad contrast with his appearance the last time I saw him. Finding I could be of no service there I went around to the Century to attend the meeting of the nominating committee of which I am a member. The news of Kensett's death soon became known and caused a profound feeling of sorrow. One of our sad duties was to put a new name in place of Kensett's as trustee of the club. A paper was handed round calling on the club to take some special action in relation to his death. . . . Kensett was one of those men with whom the idea of passing away was never associated. No artist could have been more widely missed and none could have been more universally regretted. Thursday, Dec. 19. Kensett's funeral is over. The an- nexed from the Tribune is substantially correct. Gifford and I went up through the snow and arrived just as they were carrying the body from his studio to the Academy. Mrs. Kellogg his sister sent down for Gertrude to come up and go to the church with the friends but the carriage did not come in time and so she walked to the church through a violent snow storm. It was raining when we left the Academy for the church but not violently and altogether it was a very gloomy day. But Kensett in his coffin looked almost like Kensett asleep even to the color in his face which was preserved so remarkably as to be the subject of remark by everyone. Baker's86 portrait painted for Mr. Olyphant draped in black hung at his head the kindly eyes looking away from the dead Kensett lying below. Some thoughtful hand sent flowers from Lang87 to his best friend and also from his old friend Baker both of whom are in Europe. The services at the church were simple and in excellent taste and a feeling of the profoundest sympathy pervaded the people gathered there, all his personal friends. At the close of the services nearly everyone came to look upon his dead face and many were overcome. Mrs. Ward, Dr. Parmelee's88 daughter whom I have always under- stood Kensett loved, and if report be true was beloved by her once, lingered a little while about his coffin, stooped and picked up a flower that had fallen to the floor and laid it on his breast, leaned over and smoothed his hair upon his forehead and turned sadly away, who knows with what regrets and tender memories. Towards the last a poor Negro came to look at him, some one I dare say that he had been kind to. We took him to the cemetery in Second St. and he was put into a receiving vault until it should be decided where he is to be buried - and that is the last of poor Kensett's bodily presence whose spirit is with me more than ever before. When I got back home thoroughly chilled through I found Weir here and soon Eastman Johnson came in and we sat and talked of Kensett until nearly dark when Johnson went home. Weir and Gifford dined with us and Kensett was with us all the time and has not been absent from my mind today. This morning Gertrude and I went up to his studio to see Mrs. Kellogg . .... Then we came home and I went to work upon a little picture I am painting in his memory. I began it before he died but I have never touched it since (and it has nearly all been painted since his death) that I have not thought of him constantly. It is looking out over a quiet but shadowy sea from the rough and rugged hills of Gloucester. A heavy curtain of solemn clouds hangs along the center of the picture with a quiet grey sky behind and along the far horizon stretches a band of light toward which a white bird is flying. Whittredge and Gifford are much interested in it but I have not told them what I mean in it. I think they feel it. I hope I shall never be obliged to sell it. This afternoon Mr. De Forest called with his sister-in-law to look at my pictures with a view to buying one but they did not come until four o'clock and then the sky had clouded up and it had grown so dark that they could not see them well. She said she would come again. While they were here Mr. Kauffman89 from Washing- ton called with a friend and just at dark Mr. Ogden 86. George Augustus Baker (1812-1880), a popular portrait painter of the mid-19th century. The portrait of Kensett referred to is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 87. Louis Lang (1814-1893), portrait and-genre painter and National Academician. 88. Eleazar Parmly (1797-1874), pioneer in the professionalization of American dentistry. His daughter Mary Montague married Charles Ward. 89. Samuel Hay Kauffman (d.1906), a Washington, D.C. journalist, publisher, and patron of the arts. 11</page><page sequence="12">P-- t-j JERVIS McENTEE, Old House on Long Island (undated) The Detroit Institute of Arts (Photograph by Joseph Klima, Jr.)</page><page sequence="13">who was here a week ago to buy a picture came with a Mr. Wood.90 I showed them the pictures by gas light, but it was not satisfactory and they are to call again. Mr. Hoe sent me the check for his picture ($200), the difference on the trade we made. Sunday, Dec. 22. Friday evening a meeting of the Century was called to pay our tribute of respect to the memory of Kensett. Mr. Huntington91 read a paper as did Hicks, and John Gourlie.92 Dr. Bellows93 made some appropriate and fitting remarks as he always does. . ... The proceedings are to be embodied in a memorial volume. While we were in session Dr. Bellows announced the sudden death of George P. Putnam. He died suddenly, fell dead in a moment almost, in his store on Friday afternoon. A few of the Artists present hearing that the Committee on Art for the Vienna Exposition had resigned their duties into the hands of the National Academy chiefly on account of some newspaper attacks emanating from that officious nuisance Perry,94 united in a protest and expressing entire confidence in the Committee and urging them to carry out the objects of the committee. It was signed by Huntington, Eastman Johnson, Gif- ford, Whittredge, Beard,95 and myself and subsequently by Hubbard and Hicks. It is outrageous that this wasp of a Perry rises up to breed trouble in any undertaking connected with art. I hope however we have circum- vented him. I immediately wrote to Church for his signature he having expressed the same views to Huntington. Last night just before dark Mr. Wood of Brooklyn who was here a few days ago with Mr. Ogden, came in and after considerable hesitation as to which of my two brook scenes he would buy finally decided upon the one I painted for Dorman, for which he pays me four hundred dollars exclusive of the frame. Sunday, Jan. 5, 1873. We went home December 24th. Gertrude, Sara, Downing and I returned yesterday. I never had a more enjoyable visit home. . . . I am full of winter pictures and the city is tame compared with the magnificence of the snowy country. ... I saw Stedman96 at the club for the first time since my illness and he seemed very glad to see me. Wednesday, Jan. 15. Hamilton called yesterday and intimated that he or a friend of his would buy a picture of me. I was feeling pretty discouraged as no one has been in since we came home from Rondout. Hamilton has been coming so long however that I have put him in the category of all the others who are coming sometime. . . . I am painting a picture called the Wilderness a repetition of one I painted ten years ago. A violent snow storm and deer chased by wolves. Of course no one will want it. I went up to the park97 yesterday to look at the wolves and the deer. Friday, Jan. 17. A day or two ago I received by express a charming book "Gems of Art" from Mr. M. I. Whipple of Boston. About three years ago he bought a little picture of me for which he was to pay $200 at such times as was convenient. He had paid $150 and had never taken it away although I had repeatedly urged him to do so. A few days ago he asked me to send it to him saying he would pay the balance in a few days. On looking at it I concluded he had paid me enough for it and I sent it and told him so and to consider it settled. This gift was his graceful acknowledgement. I walked up to see Eastman Johnson today and while there he told me that a Mr. Hurlbert98 would call on me and that he had advised him to buy a picture. When I got home after doing several errands strangely enough I met him at my door. He delivered Johnson's card and I showed him all my pictures. He seemed very friendly and at last did what they all do went away promising to call again after telling me he had bought pictures of Gifford, Johnson, Hayes,99 Hart and others. Couldn't decide among all my pic- tures without considering. These things every day occurring show me how I fail to address in my pictures the great mass of picture buyers. I can't get used to it and feel every time the wound afresh. Thursday, Jan. 25. We had a reception100 at the Studio Building today which seems to have been a success SO far as numbers and respectability of the 90. Probably Charles B. Wood, a collector and supporter of the National Academy. 91. Daniel Huntington (1816-1906), portrait, historical, and genre painter, was a major figure in the New York art world of the 1870's and 1880's. He served as president of the National Academy for over twenty years. 92. John H. Gourlie (d.1891), a founding member of the Century Club. 93. Henry Whitney Bellows (1814-1882), a Unitarian clergyman and New York personage for over forty years. Bellows was one of the founders of the Century Club and of Antioch College. 94. Enoch Wood Perry (1831-1915). A portrait and genre painter, Perry settled in New York in 1865 where he produced such works as Grandfather's Slippers and Is Huldy to Home? McEntee detested him throughout the 1870's, but later found him more acceptable. 95. William Holbrook Beard (1824-1900) whose anthropomorphic pictures of bear, deer, and other wild life were so popular that his work was almost entirely devoted to them. 96. Edmund Clarence Stedman (1833-1908), a major literary figure in New York during the latter half of the 19th century. 97. Central Park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, was begun in the 1850's and opened in 1862. It was not entirely completed until many years later. 98. Probably William Henry Hurlbert (d.1895), whose art collection was sold at auction in May 1883. 99. William Jacob Hayes (1830-1875), a popular painter of animals and Western scenes. 100. In the winter or early spring of each year, the artists of the Studio Building held a public reception in an effort to promote sales. McEntee's reluctant attitude in 1873 is characteristic. Each year he enjoyed the occasion after much preliminary apprehension. 13</page><page sequence="14">visitors is concerned. The wealth of New York was out in full force (and its ignorance of Art too). Tenth Street was full of carriages all the afternoon. I had decided not to open my room but learning that I was expected to do so I reluctantly yielded. On the whole I rather enjoyed it, it was so much less disagreeable than I had apprehended. Among the guests was Miss Emily FaithfullIo1 the English reformer and friend of the working women. Mr. Bryant and Parke God- win102 were here but the large majority of visitors were ladies. . . . I saw by the paper this morning the death of Mr. Rand 103 the artist. I presume he died in poverty if not neglect. He was the inventor of the collapsible tubes for holding colors and was at one time a successful artist, having been entertained in the best families of England during a visit there. Monday, Jan. 27. On Friday evening we attended a reception of the working women of N.Y. to Miss Faithfull in Steinway Hall. Mrs. H. M. Field104 delivered an address introducing Miss Faithfull who addressed the meeting in a most interesting manner. There was a piano solo . . . and at the close of the meeting Nett Sterling came in with her bonnet and cloak on and sang "Caller Herrin." To a vigorous encore she sang "Don't be Sorrowful Darling" and being again called out she sang with great spirit and effect, "A Man's a Man for a' That." Altogether it was a very marked and successful occasion. We met Miss Faithfull again on Sunday evening and had a pleasant talk with her. Dick Butler 105 and Henry Smith106 called on me today to get me to send some- thing to the Ladies reception of the Union League107 on Saturday. Smith seemed rather struck with the picture I am painting Sea from Shore Cape Ann, and remarked that one of these days he would have to get something of mine. I told him to wait until I was dead, perhaps my pictures would be worth more. Gifford dined with us. Kruseman Van Elten108 called on me. He said he was going to have a sale and leave the country and go back to Holland as he could not make a living here. He regrets it as he likes America and would like to stay. I think that gradually every Artist will leave who can get away. Saturday, Feb. 1. The artists fund109 sale occurred on Tuesday evening last. Major Wilkinson110 dined with us and he and I attended the sale together. I thought the bidding not very spirited but I have since learned that the members consider it a good sale, and as indicating a reaction in favor of American works. Thursday evening was the first meeting of the new committee on admissions at the Century. Five new members were elected out of a list of more than a hundred applicants. I was gratified to see that character alone recommended a man and that wealth and family connection alone only produced smiles, as the letters were read. . . . On Thursday I sent a note to each artist in the building inviting him to come and see, for his free and frank criticism, my last picture, (not entirely completed) "Sea from Shore." Nearly every one came between 11 and 12 and it proved a pleasant occasion. I gave them each a good cigar and tried to make them feel that I should like their comments which I think they gave freely. Saturday, Feb. 8. I sent my picture to the club last Saturday night and it seems to have attracted considerable attention. Many spoke to me in com- mendation of it and I have reason to be pleased with its reception. On Tuesday evening we attended a reception at the opening of the galleries of the water color society111 at the Academy where was also the collection brought over by Mr. Blackburne. From the necessarily hasty glance I got I was not impressed with the English part. It does not fairly represent them I think ..... I had a nice visit from Mr. De Forest a day or two ago and today he brought his brother to see my pictures. Hamilton came the fore part of the week to make me an offer for my wood interior but I told him I would not take less than my price, and have half regretted it since for I very much need the money. I am hoping he will come again. Thompson made me a long visit today and Palmer was in on Tuesday seemingly no more happy and contented than 101. Emily Faithfull (1835-1895), an English business woman, phil- anthropist, and lecturer on the necessity for opportunities for women in industry. 102. Parke Godwin (1816-1904), Bryant's son-in-law and himself a writer, was for many years an important influence on the New York Evening Post. He took an active interest in the literary and artistic circles of the city. 103. John Goffe Rand (1801-1873), portrait painter and inventor whose collapsible tube mentioned by McEntee was a contribution of major significance to the artist's craft. 104. A Parisian, Laure Desportes, married Henry Martyn Field, a Presbyterian Clergyman, in 1851. She died about 1874. 105. Richard Butler (d.1902), member of the Century Club and of the Union League Club, on whose art committee he served several years in the 1870's. 106. Henry N. Smith, a New York collector. 107. The Union League Club was founded in 1863 as a patriotic organization for socially prominent New Yorkers. After the war it pursued such goals as Civil Service reform, upholding the Republican Party, and encouraging cultural facilities in the city. 108. Hendrik Dirk Kruseman Van Elten (1829-1904), Dutch born artist who settled in New York in 1865 and became an Associate of the National Academy in 1871. 109. The Artists Fund Society was founded in 1859 as a fraternal organization to aid impoverished artists and to provide relief to their families. It raised money by holding occasional sales. 110. Robert Wilkinson (d.1903), of Poughkeepsie, was Sanford Gif- ford's brother-in-law. 111. The American Water Color Society, organized in 1866 as the American Society of Painters in Water Colors, held an annual exhibition at the National Academy. 14</page><page sequence="15">we who are not getting along at all. Rossiter's112 effects were sold this week including his pictures, carved furni- ture, books, etc. I went this evening and bought some French books. Thursday, Feb. 13. Mr. Hurlbert called again today and was inclined to take my October in the Kaatskills for $1500 but of course did not come to the point. His wife is to come again and perhaps if they do not take one of W. T. Richards"13 at $1000 at Goupils they may take mine. I can't cope with Knoedler114 in selling. Friday, Feb. 14. Brevoort had his sale last night and in spite of his flattering promises his pictures went for absolutely nothing. 5. 10. 15. dollars and some he could not get a bid on. Whittredge was there and he told me it was terrible. Tuesday, Feb. 18. Mr. Hurlbert came in today with his wife, two other ladies and Mr. Hawk.115 After some discussion he took my brook scene near Scrib- ner's, for $400. Church came in and kindly, but rather persistently, I thought, recommended him to take this when I hoped he would like my "October in the Kaatskills." I confess I was disappointed and felt rather that I had lost a thousand dollars than made four hundred. I fail to impress these business men, ignorant of art. Church always comes in for the lion's share. I wish I were not restive under this neglect. I can't get used to it knowing as I well do that among cultivated and thoughtful people I am the peer of any of the painters. Church is very friendly to me but sometimes I think he does not really feel my pictures, and that he wouldn't like me so well if I had his popularity. I may do him injustice. An unsuccessful man has at least this advantage - he doesn't excite envy. Wednesday, Feb. 19. A Mr. Moore,116 an art dealer of Union Square called on me. I had a long talk with him and an interesting one as he seemed a cultivated man and a man of ideas as well as of nice feeling for Art. He staid a couple of hours and ordered a small picture which I am to paint and which I have no idea will please him. I received a letter from Geo. A. Baker from Rome. Last evening we were invited to dine informally at Mr. De Forests. Church and I thought we would not go in evening dress. When I arrived there I found quite a party. Mr. and Mrs. Marquand,117 Miss Hitchcock,118 Church and his wife and Mr. De Forest and Lockwood119 in full dress. However we had a delightful dinner and I didn't let my clothes worry me. Yesterday afternoon after Mr. Moore had been here I went immediately at his little picture of Hussey Hill under an atmospheric effect and nearly finished it before evening. Of course I shall work more on it, but it is substantially done. I want now to get in the way of painting some more sunny atmospheric effects. I don't address many people with my greys. Sunday, Feb. 23. Friday it snowed all day and towards evening turned to rain. Mr. Williams of Williams and Everett120 came in and looked at my pictures. I saw that he would buy something if I would sell cheaply and so I proposed to him to let him have some of the smaller pictures at prices which would enable him to make something on them. The result was that I sold him a little Autumn "Hussey Hill" 12 x 20 for which I ask $300, for $200 including frame, and the study for my Sea from Shore same size for $175 agreeing to exchange the latter if he cannot sell it after a reasonable time. I think it would be a good thing for me if the dealers would take hold of my pictures and to get them to do it they must make money on them. . . . Yesterday being Washington's birthday was a holiday and I had a number of visits. Hamilton came in with his wife to tell me I made a great mistake in not allowing him to make me an offer the last time he was here. That he was prepared to offer me within $40 of my price but that I was so decided he went and spent the money for a picture of Eastman Johnson, the Scissors Grinder. I could only say I had not changed my mind and that he could not have been very much in want of my picture. Shortly after he went Mr. Parkin121 came in with his wife to see my "Sea from Shore" which he seemed to like very much. . . . In the evening I attended a private view of Kruseman Van Eltens pictures and studies which he is going to sell and from there Whittredge and I went to the Lotus Club,122 where we found Eastman Johnson and 112. Thomas Prichard Rossiter (1818-1871), a portrait and historical painter. 113. William Trost Richards (1833-1905), a popular Philadelphia marine painter. 114. Michael Knoedler came to New York from Paris in 1846 to open a branch of Goupil et Cie. Eleven years later he opened his own gallery which became a major influence in the New York art market and continues so to this day. 115. Probably Samuel Hawk, a New York collector in the 1870's. 116. Rufus Ellis Moore, a "Dealer in Fine Art Works," whose pamphlet, Notes on "What is Art" and Catalogue of American Paintings, 1874 contains enthusiastic praise of McEntee's work. 117. Henry Gurdon Marquand (1819-1902), a capitalist and devoted patron of the arts, was active in the founding of the Metropolitan Museum and served as its second president from 1889 to 1902. 118. Probably Miss Sarah M. Hitchcock, a collector of the 1860's and 1870's. 119. Lockwood De Forest (1850-1932), a son of Henry Grant De Forest, studied painting under Frederic E. Church. He traveled extensively and was especially interested in India, where he founded workshops for the revival of woodcarving. 120. Williams and Everett was an old Boston firm which operated a free gallery in addition to serving as a dealer. 121. William W. Parkin (d.1902) was a New York merchant and collector and a member of the Century Club. 122. The Lotus Club was founded in 1870 to provide a less con- servative atmosphere than that of the Century Club. Its members were chiefly journalists, literary men, artists, actors, and musicians. 15</page><page sequence="16">a number of the artists. There was music and recita- tions and a rather agreeable time. Wednesday, March 5. Last week Mr. Williams of Williams and Everett of Boston came in and I sold him two of my small pictures at low prices. I have also sold Mr. Moore a dealer two and get a commission of four hundred dollars from him. Lydig Suydam123 came in today and bought my little English Cottage for $250 so I feel that I am doing something. On Monday we dined with Gifford in company with George Coale,124 Fitch, Hubbard. Coale in attempting to show me how to carve a canvas back duck broke a wine glass and covered Fitch with wine and himself with confusion. Last night we dined with Fitch, Coale, Whittredge and his wife, Eastman Johnson and wife and Hubbard. Sunday I went up to visit Stedman in their new apartment in 56th Str. At the monthly meeting of the Century last Saturday the proposition to increase the number of members was again decisively negatived. Thursday, March 6. Mrs. Mozier called to see us today. We had not seen her since Mozier's death. She is going to sell at auction eleven of his statues and from what she told me she is depending largely upon the results of the sale. I fear they will not sell well. Friday, March 7. I called on Mrs. Church in the evening at Mr. Osborn's125 and tried to get her to speak a word for Mrs. Mozier's sale among her friends. Her mother was there and had been to call on Mrs. Mozier. From there I went to call at Dr. Holland's126 and saw the Dr. and Mrs. Holland. Sunday, March 9. I went to the club for an hour. Talked with Bret Harte,127 Col. Hay, 128 Whitelaw Reid who introduced me to Edmund Yates129 who leaves for England on Wednesday. Stedman presented me to him as the most "characteristic American artist." Today I wrote a note to Mr. Hoe calling his attention to Mrs. Mozier's sale and bespeaking his interest. Friday, March 14. Monday and Tuesday and Wednes- day I spent until 11 o'clock at night helping hang Kensett's pictures in the Academy. It is amazing to see what a quantity of good work he left behind him. The Academy is full. The private view occurred last night and a great many people came. I am in great worry and anxiety on account of my affairs. The season is rapidly passing away and I do not sell much. How I am to get along this summer I have no idea. Thursday, March 20. On Saturday night I went to the club and made an arrangement with Mr. Black- burn to have his wife dine with us on Monday and take her to Brooklyn to the Reception of the Art Society as he was invited to dine with the committee. Accordingly she came and I escorted her there. The Reception was a great success. They had their two fine rooms and the Academy opening together and such crowds of people I never saw on a like occasion. They had many fine pictures. I sent my Sea from Shore. Wednesday evening Mr. and Mrs. Blackburn dined with us and seemed to enjoy the quiet occasion very much. They have been feted so much and seen so much of the formal side of New York life that I was glad to show them how one of the artists lives. He seemed thoroughly to enjoy the evening and thought we lived an artistic life. Whittredge's little daughter 16 months old died this (Wednesday) after- noon. I went up yesterday to inquire about it and met Whittredge who seemed very anxious. It will be a severe blow to him at his time of life. I went up there this morning to see if I could do anything. Whittredge and Gifford had gone up to Woodlawn cemetery, but I saw Mrs. Whittredge and she showed me her dead child. Poor woman, she has had many sorrows and bears them with great bravery. Monday, March 24. Although I had a headache on Saturday I forced myself to go around to the sale of Mozier's statues. There were not many people present but the eleven works brought about $7000 which was more than I feared they would. . ... The Kensett sale commenced this evening which I attended. The total of the evening's sale was 110 pictures 19,440, frames 1968.42 - total $21,408.42 which was doing remark- ably well. Sunday, March 30. Thursday we had a reception in the afternoon and evening to which a great many people came a large proportion ladies. I don't think many who buy pictures came and I am more and more convinced that they do us no good. Friday I worked on my Arch of Nero and improved it. I got a nice letter from Booth'30 from Chicago in which he 123. David Lydig Suydam (d.1884), a book and art collector and member of the Century Club. 124. George H. Coale, a Baltimore collector and patron of the arts. 125. William Henry Osborn (1820-1894) was a railroad promoter, philanthropist, and art patron. He was Church's particular friend and the buyer of many of his paintings. 126. Josiah Gilbert Holland (1819-1881) abandoned medicine for literature in the late 1840's and thereafter was a prolific writer of didactic essays, poems, and novels. He was a founder and first editor of Scribner's Monthly. 127. Francis Bret Harte (1836-1902) was at the peak cf his fame in 1873, only two years after he left California. 128. John Milton Hay (1838-1905). The famous writer and diplomat was in his first editorial phase at this time, serving under Whitelaw Reid on the New York Tribune. He received one of McEntee's paintings in 1874 for a wedding present.. 129. Edmund Yates (1831-1894), an English writer and editor, was on a lecturing tour of the United States in 1873. 130. Edwin Thomas Booth (1833-1893). The great Shakespearean actor was one of McEntee's closest friends. Several years later a temporary estrangement occurred over the collapse of Booth's daughter's engagement to McEntee's nephew, Downing Vaux. 16</page><page sequence="17">tells me he has given up the management of his theater to his brother Junius. Eastman Johnson came and I went up to his house with him. Just after we had gone Tom Appleton131 came in and made a long call on Gertrude. Friday, April 4. I spent the evening last Sunday at Thompsons with Mr. and Mrs. Joy,132 Mr. and Mrs. Rood,133 Eastman Johnson and his wife and Mrs. Youmans. Gertrude was not well enough to go. Monday I sent my pictures to the Academy. "Novem- ber" 24 x 40 and "Sea from Shore" 24 x 42. Both are for sale and the price of each is $1250. I am sorry I cannot feel the old interest in the Academy but it is a different thing from what it used to be. This week I have been painting on a little picture 12 x 20 of Scribner's Mill and working on the Arch of Nero. Today I commenced a picture of the brook near Schutts a study of which I made last fall. Eastman Johnson was in on Tuesday and told me a man at the Falls of St. Anthony had bought a picture of him without seeing it and expressed a wish to get some unconventional landscapes. Eastman thinking I knew how to paint that sort has written him about this one and meanwhile I told him I would go to work at a picture from it so that he can have it if he wants it. It's only a chance but in these dull days I feel like improving every chance. The Kensett sale netted $127,000 exclusive of the frames. Besides there is this summer's work $20,000 and his private collection $14,000. I was in hopes this would call immediate attention to American Art but although it brought buyers from all parts of the country, only one or two have been here at the Studio Building. Tom Appleton came in yesterday and sat an hour with me. What a sense of worldly prosperity that man always impresses me with, and not at all in an offensive way. I know he likes my pictures and yet he has never bought the least thing. I like to talk with him. Tuesday, April 15. Thursday I took Moore up to Eastman's by appointment and he has promised to let him have two pictures for his sale. . ... Friday I made a little sketch to give to Mrs. Blackburn, the second one I have done. Mr. Moore came in and urged me to let him have it which I did. Saturday I painted another little sketch for Mrs. Blackburn. And Mr. Johnson34 a jeweler, with whom Eastman John- son has exchanged a picture, called on me and staid a long time as it was a rainy day. I sold him my little picture of the Cardinal on the Campagna for $100 which I am to take in trade from his establishment. Sunday I walked up to the upper end of the Park and back to Eastman's. . ... Last night I went to the opening reception at the Academy. There were a great many people there and seemingly enjoying the evening. There are not so many pictures as usual but the exhibition seems as good as in past years. The Tribune this morning thinks it has reached the lowest depths, but praises Eastman Johnson and a few others, among them me, as excellent in my limited sphere. I went to the Academy this morning to get a look at the pictures, but as usual I met people who kept me from doing as I wished. I met Mr. Olyphant there. He told me they buried Kensett in Greenwood yesterday. .... Mr. Olyphant was looking for my picture when I saw him (the Sea from Shore). Someone had directed his attention to it. He remarked to me before he left that he had no more room for pictures. I can't quite under- stand why he should not have a representative picture by me, since he has pictures by most of the artists. Tuesday, April 22. Avery had a private view of all of his pictures on Wednesday evening last at the gallery 625 Broadway where he has sent them for private sale while he makes some alterations in his house. He asked me to send a picture and I let him have my "Kaatskill woods." It was a stormy evening but there were a good many people there. John Taylor Johnston135 was there and asked me to be sure to come to his reception on Wednesday. I said "perhaps so" for I did not intend to go. As we came away Avery told me that two people had asked him the price of my picture. Thursday I spent at Eastman Johnson's studio painting on the fore- ground of his "Sap Gatherers." It was a dismal rainy day, the room got cold and I took cold. We had a delightful day together however and I think enjoyed ourselves much better than if we had gone to John Taylor Johnstons. We each have a grievance with Mr. Johnston. I will do him the justice to believe he did not intentionally mean to wound either of us, but I hold it a part of my duty to let him know that all the American Artists are not the selfish men he thinks them. I dare say he is shown many times the worst side of artistic life here in New York, but it is his misfortune if not his fault if he cannot discriminate between true and false men. At least I choose not to put myself in positions where I am liable to be misunderstood. When I reached home I found that Church had been here and left tickets for Niblos136 for the evening where 131. Thomas Gold Appleton (1812-1884), a writer, traveler, con- versationalist, and intimate friend of the Boston literati. 132. Charles Arad Joy (1823-1891), a professor of Chemistry at Columbia and popular writer on scientific subjects. 133. Ogden Nicholas Rood (1831-1902) was a physicist whose ex- periments in optics were important contributions to that science. He was also a talented painter and often exhibited works at the annual shows of the American Water Color Society. 134. Probably S. Fisher Johnson, a New York collector of the 1860's and 1870's. 135. John Taylor Johnston (1820-1893), a prosperous railroad pro- moter and one of the chief art collectors in New York. He was a leading figure in the founding of the Metropolitan Museum and served as its first president from 1870 to 1889. 136. Niblo's Theatre opened in 1828 and remained a popular stage through most of the century. 17</page><page sequence="18">we were to meet him and his wife, to my astonishment. I thought they only went to prayer meetings. We went and saw the Vokes family137 in a clever little farce called the Belles of the Kitchen. Friday I went up to Dr. Otis to be examined as a candidate for the Artists Fund Society. . ... I wrote a note to Avery yesterday that much as I regretted it I would take a thousand dollars for my picture rather than not sell it. Eastman Johnson came in today for a few minutes. He seems a little unsettled about the competitive sale of Mr. Moore's to come off but says he will not back out. Sunday, April 27. Last Wednesday Gifford gave a charming dinner party in his studio. There were present Vaux and wife, Major Wilkinson and wife, Mary Gifford, her niece Edith Gifford, Sara, Miss Sterling, my wife and I. We had a most pleasant time as we always do at these studio dinners. After dinner they all came down to our rooms where we had ice cream and some songs from Miss Sterling. . ... My picture "October in the Kaatskills" went to Mr. Moore's sale limited at $1,000 and frame. . ... Friday I received a letter from Baltimore enquiring the price of my "November" in the Academy. It was from a dealer and I sent the price $1250 and told them if they sold to retain $100. .... Saturday. Mr. George Chickering called on me. He seems a refined and charming gentle- man and I enjoyed his visit exceedingly. He likes my picture better and better. Mr. Moore opened his collection this evening. I should have gone in spite of my swollen face only that we had tickets for Beethoven's 9th Symphony sent us and we went there instead. It was splendidly performed by Thomas's138 orchestra and the Haydn and Handel Society of Boston. Palmer the sculptor and his family sailed for Europe today as did Bradford and Mrs. Joy ..... I went up to see Eastman Johnson and we had a long talk on the affairs of the Academy. He is waking up to the im- portance of doing something to arrest the apathy which prevails in regard to it. Out of over 80 Academicians only 20 are represented in the exhibition and the most of those very inadequately. I think something might be done if some one would make a move but I hesitate to get myself into so much work, for it will take downright hard work to revive interest among men who are, many of them, very selfish. Sunday, May 4. Monday I went to see Mr. Moore's collection of American pictures which struck me as a very creditable one. There are three of mine there. My October in the Kaatskills (30 x 54) limited at $1000. A wood interior (15 x 22) belonging to Mr. Moore and a small November (10 x 12) also belonging to him.... (Tuesday) .... I called on Whittredge to see if anything could be done about the Academy. I found him inclined to act and we decided to go and see Page and talk frankly with him. He was not in and we called on Perry. He professed to be in earnest about reconciling the differences in the Academy. He pro- posed a committee consisting of Page, Gifford, Richards,139 Casilear,140 and Huntington to select a ticket for the coming annual election which we thought well of. Accordingly Page called on Gifford but he told me subsequently that Gifford was not inclined to be active in the movement. I saw Gifford afterwards and urged him to serve. He did not say positively he would not but was very unwilling to. He says as I believe that the present management, seeing the poor exhibition we have this year are getting tired and are anxious to compromise. I think we had better meet them half way and not wait until they do more damage. Thursday. Church called and offered me a ticket to hear Fechter 141 in Monte Cristo this evening. At first I declined as I am on the committee on admissions of the Century which meets tonight, but he was very desirous I should go and I accepted. I don't like the play which is too sensational and Fechter does not satisfy me. I think him excellent in a certain way, but not in the way I like best. My father came down today to see if I could let him have some money and fortunately I could help him to a hundred dollars. Friday. Rained. I went to Eastman Johnson's and telling him my father was here he said if he would stay over another day he would make a sketch of him. I went from there to Mary's to see him and he said he would. Eastman's friend in St. Anthony is to take my picture of the brook for which I am thankful, and I have ordered the frame. Saturday. Still raining. My father came over at 10 and we went up to Eastman's. He went to work to paint his head life size and stuck at it until 3 o'clock when he had to leave for the train. He made a good spirited sketch but he regretted he could not stay longer. I went to the Century in the evening. I sent my little Scribner's Mill (12 x 20) hoping someone would buy it. Sunaay, May 11. Monday Mr. Moore's sale came off. The room was crowded with people but the 137. A family of English actors in burlesque, including Frederick Mortimer Vokes (1846-1888), actor and dancer; Jessie Catherine Biddulph (1851-1884), actress and dancer; Victoria Vokes (1853- 1894), actress and singer; and Rosina Vokes (1858-1894), actress. 138. Christian Friedrich Theodore Thomas (1835-1905), an extremely talented musician, organized his own orchestra which held an annual series of concerts during the 1860's and 1870's. 139. Thomas Addison Richards (1820-1900), landscape painter and travel writer, served for forty years as corresponding secretary of the National Academy. 140. John William Casilear (1811-1893), whose lucrative career as a banknote engraver gave him the means to pursue later an independent course as a painter and the precision for which his landscapes are noted. He was active in the affairs of both the National Academy and the Artists Fund Society. 141. Charles Albert Fechter (1824-1879). A stormy figure on the French, English and American stage, Fechter had arrived in New York in 1869. By 1873 he had already entered on the decline that soon stripped him of all public favor. 18</page><page sequence="19">bidding was spiritless and many pictures were not sold at all. My little picture Autumn 10 x 12 for which he gave me $80 brought $140 exclusive of the frame. A picture by Gifford about 16 x 28 brought $600. Hayes came to the building for the first time in two months having been ill and subjected to a painful surgical operation. Tuesday I commenced a little picture 12 x 20. Wednesday Sara went home after a stay of seven months studying here in the city. I can't help admiring the energy with which she has carried on her studies under many discouragements. How often I have regretted my inability to assist her. Thursday. Mr. Moore came in and paid me $280.... He owes me altogether about $700 which I very much need but his sale was unsuccessful and he cannot pay me and what I am to do I do not know. It rained all day Thursday and Friday and Saturday. I went up to see Mr. Huntington on Saturday to urge him to stand for President of the Academy but he positively refused and I came away very much dis- couraged about Academy affairs. He, Page, Casilear, Guy142 had an informal meeting at the Academy and nominated Ward for President and me for vice- president but I shall never consent to stand being con- scious of my unfitness, and while I esteem it a mark of confidence that some of my most valued artist friends like Whittredge and Johnson urge me to run I have positively decided I will not. I think the Academy will be wrecked for there is no espirit du corps . . . [Sunday] Eastman and I talked of the Academy affairs and finally as we could hit upon no plan both con- cluded the only thing to do was to go to the meeting on Wednesday and let affairs take their course. I anticipate nothing but confusion, no one to take hold of the sinking ship and that our Academy that ought to be our pride and glory will go down on account of the apathy of some and the unwise measures which have been forced upon it by others. .. I have the record of last year to repeat. I have suffered agonies of anxiety on account of my money affairs and since Mr. Moore has not been able to pay me, have been almost in despair. I am utterly helpless and suffer intensely whenever I allow myself to reflect upon my situation. I talked with Johnson about it, but what can he do but sympathise. I cannot help a feeling of injustice and wonder why I must continually drag this chain for no fault of my own that I am aware of. Monday, May 12. Called on Avery. He had previously told me that Mr. Lucius Tuckerman143 had admired my Kaatskill woods and would advise a friend of his who wanted an American Landscape to buy it. As nothing further had been heard from him I asked Avery if he thought it would not be proper- for me to write a note to Mr. T. and tell him I would like to sell it and would dispose of it at a reasonable price. He advised me to do so and accordingly I wrote to that effect, a thing I dislike to do but which I feel obliged to do under the circumstances. It is significant in reading over my journal how much I am occupied with my daily affairs and anxieties about money. Will it eventually swallow all my artistic enthusiasm? Tuesday, May 13. A Mr. Max Wey1144 came from Washington with a letter from Mr. Kauffman. He is in business there, but paints landscape and intends to become a professional artist. He was a shy, awkward man, a German I should say, but he was very observant and struck me as a man of much natural intelligence. I went to several of the studios with him. In the even- ing we went to Nett Sterling's farewell concert which was well attended by an appreciative and intelligent audience. Wednesday, May 14. The annual meeting of the Academy. Our party hoped to elect Huntington presi- dent but there was a tie between him and Ward and he withdrew in favor of Ward much to our disappoint- ment. My name was on one of the tickets (the opposition with which I have no sympathy) for vice president and I found to my surprise that I should have taken a nearly unanimous vote, but I peremptorily declined and nominated Whittredge who was elected. I came away with a feeling of great disappointment as did Johnson and Gifford but on talking with others I find a pretty good feeling. Johnson and I staid to the dinner although we did not want to. Church staid also and there were many promises from Academicians to do their best to make the next exhibition creditable. The Academy is in a bad way and I don't feel that much was accomplished at this meeting, but time will show. Thursday, May 15. Weir breakfasted with us and Eastman Johnson called. Mr. Moore came in. He owes me $520 on which I have been depending and I learned with great regret that he cannot pay me now and perhaps not until he sells the pictures he bought of me and no one knows when that will be. Friday, May 16. I walked up to Eastman's and had a long talk with him for I was very discouraged and unhappy. He is practical and sympathetic and his friendship is a great comfort to me when I feel that there is not much left but one's friendships. Saturday, May 17. Vaux and Mary came in while we 142. Seymour Joseph Guy (1824-1910), a portrait and genre painter of such titles as Baby's Bed-time and Feeding the Ducks had come to New York from England in 1854 and was elected to the National Academy in 1865. 143. Lucius Tuckerman (d.1890) was a cultivated New York merchant and art patron. 144. Max Weyl (1837-1914), a landscape painter who emigrated from Germany in 1853 and lived in Washington, D.C. for the rest of his life. 19</page><page sequence="20">were at breakfast to have us go up to the park to see Miss Stebbins'145 fountain to which they had been adapting the water and which was to be tried in her presence. We met her there and also Miss Cushman.146 I was introduced to Mrs. McKagg147 from Chicago and to her two daughters one of whom bought from Mr. Moore my little picture of Hussy Hill which I sold him this winter. I think the fountain a success as did all. I met Clarence Cook148 there who graciously approved. Wednesday, May 21. Eastman Johnson came in this morning and saw the picture in the frame which I am going to send to Mr. Morrill, St. Anthony, Minn. It is to go tomorrow and I have attended to having it boxed by Wilmurt.149 ... Pinchot150 called this after- noon having lately come from Paris where he left his family. He wants to get settled at home again. Says Boughton is flourishing finely. His reputation is increasing, his prices also and his picture this year in the Royal Academy is better hung than any other of his has been before and that he sold it for more than he got for his three pictures which Mr. Jessup owns. Think of my condition compared to his. A reputation in England is valuable while here it is worth nothing. Our people having no deep seated love of Art are fickle and take up and abandon their favorites in mere caprice. We who are living and working today are the pioneers and I hope and believe that those who come after us, who are strong and original men will have a better time. Mr. Blackburn told Vaux and Stoddard151 also that he considered me the best and most original landscape painter in America, but my pictures accumulate on my hands and there seems no one to buy them. It is well to look about now under these disheartening conditions to see if possible where the difficulty lies. In the first place I think the American artists as a rule ask too much for their pictures. I think my pride and my ambition to have my works esteemed among the best have often prevented my selling when I might have done so by taking smaller prices. I have resolved to ask less for my pictures and in future I hope I may be wise enough not to refuse any reasonable offer. One hardly knows what to do. There is the feeling of not wishing to depreciate one's works, but I can't afford to lay too much stress upon this and I hope I have resolved to swallow my pride. Thursday, May 22. Just as I was in the midst of writing a not very cheerful letter to my father there was a knock at my door and Mr. Francis Weeks152 came in. After talking some time he spoke of my picture on the easel and liked it very much. Then he asked me if I had the little picture of Scribner's Mill which I showed him. He asked my price for each and here I had an opportunity to put in practice my resolve of yesterday. I named $300 and $500 respec- tively but told him he could have them at $200 and $400 he paying for frames. He said that was perfectly satisfactory and told me that if Avery did not take the larger one he would; so I sold my picture and lifted myself at once out of the state of distraction in which I have been for some time past. Gifford invited us to dine with him this evening to meet Pinchot and Whittredge and his wife. Whittredge did not understand that his wife was invited and so she did not come, much to our regret. We had a very pleasant time. Pinchot gave us some very interesting accounts of his life in Paris and his visits to the artists, particularly to Cabanell153 who has painted the portraits of his wife and children in costume (for $12,000 gold as I inferred) and which I immediately begged him to let us have for the next Academy exhibition. He told us that Couture154 wears sabots and is very close in money matters. It is surprising what a respect these European artists inspire in the breasts of our travelled Americans. Sunday, May 25. Irving1'55 came and spent the greater part of the day in my studio making a study of my cabinet for a picture. I went out to see Avery about my picture, but did not find him in .... About 12 o'clock Avery and his wife came in. I showed him the picture which he seemed to like, but he began to explain to me that he had no positive order to buy; but would write to the person &amp;c. I however put him at his ease by telling him that I only wanted to carry 145. Emma Stebbins (1815-1882), a sculptor and painter who lived in Rome in the 1860's and became the confidante, biographer, and heir of the actress Charlotte Cushman. 146. Charlotte Saunders Cushman (1816-1876). The greatest Ameri- can actress of the 19th century. 147. The sister of the Chicago capitalist William B. Ogden and the wife of Ezra B. McCagg, a prominent Chicago lawyer. 148. Clarence Chatham Cook (1828-1900). Reacting against the uncritical acceptance accorded to most American art, Cook became New York's most caustic writer on the subject. He was widely regarded among the artists as merely eccentric, but he was, in fact, a pioneer in professional criticism in this country. 149. Thomas A. Wilmurt was probably the chief frame maker for New York artists during the 1870's and 1880's. 150. James W. Pinchot (1831-1908), a prosperous New York mer- chant and devoted art collector. His son Gifford was named after the painter Sanford R. Gifford. 151. Richard Henry Stoddard (1825-1903), a New York literary figure whose wife Elizabeth was a novelist. The Stoddards were McEntee's close friends and the diary has several informative references to their difficulties. 152. Francis H. Weeks was the brother of Mrs. Henry Grant De Forest and a collector of American paintings. 153. Alexandre Cabanel (1823-1893), a fashionable Parisian portrait painter under the Second Empire and the Republic. 154. Thomas Couture (1815-1879), French historical and genre pain- ter and influential teacher. 155. John Beaufain Irving (1825-1877). A South Carolinian, Irving studied abroad and after the Civil War settled in New York where he painted portraits and genre works. 20</page><page sequence="21">out my good faith towards him as another person would take it and be glad to get it provided he relinquished his prior claim to it, which he did as I quite expected. He admired a little picture I have, a brook scene 12 x 20. I told him I had two pictures that size left and showed him the Scribner's Mill, and that he had better buy them as I would sell them to him so that he could make something. I told him my price was $300 and if he would take them he might have the two for $175 each without frames. He said if the season were not past he would do it in a moment, and I am still hoping he will before we leave. I think he will look about for customers for them. Mr. Moore was in yesterday and wanted me to do something for a man who wants a picture, but he gave me no definite order. However I will manage to have some- thing by and by. In the evening Gertrude and I looked over my affairs and I find my receipts have been larger than last year. I have paid off some debts, and looking over the whole field I find after all I have reason to be encouraged. It is a good thing to take a general survey occasionally to find what can be improved upon and what avoided. Certainly I have gained in reputation, I am well and ready to see and to receive impressions and feel a freshness and enthusiasm in my Art that I wonder at considering how unhappy I have been many times the past year. Monday, May 26. I wrote to Dr. Cock156 today telling him I had my picture (Kaatskill Woods) which he wanted to buy last Spring for $1000 telling him if he was still interested in it I would try to make the price satisfactory to him. I hate to do even a legitimate piece of business like this but I do not feel warranted in leaving any honorable means untried to sell my picture. Mr. Weeks called and paid me $400 for my picture "A Soft Grey Autumn Day" (14 x 26) and I sent it home to him by Russel. Saturday, May 31. We left New York for Rondout for the summer. Sunday, June 22. By invitation from the Churches Gertrude and I went up there with the 11:30 a.m. train on Friday. Mrs. Church met us at the station. They are living in the upper part of their new house while the carpenters are at work down below. . . . It was very hot and smoky and the wind blew a gale and the place did not look its best. I think it one of the finest situations I know of and the house is very artistic. We came home on Saturday, quite to their disappointment as they wanted us to stay longer. Church quite urged us to come up to make a long stay so that he and I could go off sketching together. They took us for a drive out towards the Claverack Creek on our way to the rail road but it was so windy and dusty we did not enjoy it much. Saturday, August 23. Yesterday we returned from our visit to Nantucket by the day boat. Gertrude was ill there for several days and consequently did not see as much of the island as I did, still we had a very pleasant visit. Eastman and I went about the town and into many of the old houses which with their sleepy quiet air were very unlike most American homes. In one of them I bought a couple of pieces of old china and we saw a few nice pieces of old furniture, one beautiful old clock which had just been bought by a Boston man for thirty dollars from a house near Eastman's .... I received a letter this evening from Whittredge from Shandaken where he and his wife are staying at Laments hotel. He is not well and his letter is very sad and shows that he is much depressed. He wants me to come out and see him and I am going this after- noon. I was struck with Whittredge's look when I left him in N.Y. and I am anxious about him. He had something of the look which I saw come over Mozier's face the winter we were in Rome, and I have thought of it many times. Wednesday, Sept. 17. Returned from Church's today, leaving Gertrude to go home with Mary Gifford to remain until Saturday. Had a very pleasant visit at Church's and most delightful weather. I made a few sketches. Lockwood De Forest was there. Church has a very lame wrist157 which I think is very serious and I think he is troubled about. . . . Sunday, Oct. 19. I returned last evening from Dean's Corners where I went on September 18 to join Whit- tredge for our Autumn sketching. Whittredge was much out of health when I first went out, a rain storm set in and I was very undecided about remaining. However I thought it would be unwise to come back without investigating the region and the result was that we found it an exceedingly interesting place. We went directly to work, the autumn color soon began to show and we never lacked for subjects. The streams are charming and the meadows which in summer are almost inaccessible in summer for their rank growth were as beautiful as anything could be. I made about twenty sketches in all and the most of them are things which I think I will be pretty sure to use. We had an excellent boarding place at Mr. P. Elmendorf's, a fine new house where we were luxuriously installed and altogether the four weeks have been most satisfactory. Vaux joined us after we had been there a week and remained three weeks sketching all the time and enjoying it to the utmost. 156. Thomas F. Cock (d.1896), a physician, member of the Century Club, and buyer of American paintings. 157. As early as 1869 Church had been afflicted by a lame wrist. Sometimes described as "inflammatory rheumatism," this con- dition became progressively worse and severly restricted the artist's activities in later years. 21</page><page sequence="22">Saturday, Nov. 29. Painted all day on my late Autumn. The weather continues steadily wintry. Took a walk towards Kingston in the evening. Received a letter from Sara today in which she tells me that Mrs. Stoddard met a gentleman at dinner at Stedman's who says he will give five hundred dollars for one of my pictures if he sees one he likes. That he has always wanted one and has tried to approach me personally and through others but that I ask more than the best French artists. She wants to know what I have in my studio and if Mrs. Stoddard can take him there. Mrs. S. declines to say who he is. I have written to Sara that I have nothing for $500. He can have either of the four in my room for $1000 to pay me $500 now and $500 in a year if that will be any accomodation or can have the "Pine Tree" for $500. That I am painting a little late Autumn for $300, that I have finished a Winter which I will probably send to the Century next month which he can have for $300 and that Mrs. Stoddard may tell him that I think he is mistaken if he says that I charge more than the best French artists unless he refers to the French landscape artists in which I say it is because I think mine better than theirs. I have heard such things as this before and have learned that they mean talk and not business. Saturday, December 20. Painted on the Autumn; made the sky lighter and much better. Finished it before dinner and wrote to Moore that the two would be ready to send in a day or two but I would not send them until I heard from him. I told him I would only charge him $50 for the Winter Evening although it is larger than the original sketch I sent him and that the Autumn would be $100 and he could do as he pleased about taking them as I thought I could get more for them. Told him I had a morning effect of the subject I sent him "On the Hudson" mouth of the creek which he could have at the same price $75. Sunday, Dec. 21. I read an extract in Saturday's Tribune from one of the magazines on Chester Hard- ing158 the American artist. Whittredge told me some- thing about him while we were at Dean's this fall. While Whittredge was working with his (Whittredge's) brother who was a house and sign painter in Cincinnati Harding used to come there and have his colors ground and his canvasses prepared for his southern tours, and Whittredge used to do it, by which he was brought into quite close relation with him. He says he was a man of great talent and painted fine heads and more- over he was kind and sympathetic and helpful to him. He gave me great respect for him. I had only heard of him and fancied him not much of an artist but more of a sportsman. Tuesday, Dec. 23. Painted on my larger picture today and advanced it considerably. Received a note from Moore asking me to send the three little pictures which I immediately packed and sent by express. He said in his letter he had sold a picture of Casilear's for $500 and one of Eastman Johnson's for $1250 but that times were very hard. Saturday, Dec. 27. I have been thinking a great deal lately about figure painting and would practice it if I could decide upon the best way of proceeding. I should like very much to be able to paint figures and see no reason why I could not. Today I made a sketch of a head of a young girl from a pencil sketch I made, a recollection of a face I saw in the choir of the Methodist church. If I could get models, which is the part I dread, I am sure I could work with great pleasure. Rec'd a note from Bret Harte in which he says he will be glad to come and stay with us. Monday, Dec. 29. This morning I commenced a little figure subject of a young girl taking an Autumn walk and stopping at a little foot bridge to watch the leaves floating in the water, using Gertrude for a model for the figure and drapery. We were very much amused by my invention for a railing for the bridge for her to lean on which I constructed from a quilting frame one end resting on the table and the other on a foot stool which answered capitally. I have succeeded in drawing a very graceful figure and painted on it all day with reasonable success. I am extremely interested and find the days all too short. If I can only get into the way of doing figures what a new source of interest will be opened to me, and I am sure I can do them after proper practice. Friday, Jan. 2, 1874. I painted all forenoon and at 2 o'clock went down to the ferry to meet Bret Harte. He came according to appointment and we dined after his arrival. In the evening we all went down to the lecture "The Argonauts of 49." I introduced him to the audience. His lecture was extremely interesting but I imagine too subtle for the most of the audience. There was a fair attendance but it was a damp foggy night which probably kept many away. After the lecture we had a little supper, and after supper a cigar and a familiar chat until bed time. Saturday, Jan. 3. Harte and I had a cosy morning over the fire talking on art and poetry. I find him a most interesting man and remarkably quick to perceive everything fine and delicate and subtle in thought or expression. I have enjoyed his visit extremely. I should say he would be careless in money matters and not ready to avail himself of small material advantages, as what artist or poet is. I think he would borrow your coat but not more readily than he would lend his shirt and I am quite sure I should like him whatever faults he might develop. 158. Chester Harding (1782-1866), self-taught portrait painter whose natural talent and extraordinary charm brought him many eminent sitters. 22</page><page sequence="23">Monday, Jan. 5. I received a letter from Moore today very coolly informing me that as he had not sold the picture he got of me nearly a year ago he would not be able to send me any money. I sat down at once and wrote him that if he did not pay me for the three pictures I sent him last or the old account he must return the last pictures to me, that I was done selling him my pictures at small prices and waiting for my pay until he sold them and that I never contemplated giving him any such advantages as he seemed to expect as a matter of course. I am disgusted with him and what he gets from me hereafter he will have to pay me the cash for. Tuesday, Jan. 6. Finished my little picture today, or at least finished it as far as I can until I have an op- portunity to show it to Eastman Johnson for his advice and criticism. I wrote to him today telling him all about it, how seriously I contemplated trying to become a figure painter and how I have worked away on this. . . . I took a walk about 4 o'clock. It has rained and sleeted all day and the landscape had a peculiar and beautiful effect with the grey sleety fields and patches of lighter snow under a heavy leaden sky. The look off towards Hussey Hill half smothered in mist was particularly fine, all the landscape looking distinct but as if seen through a colored glass very low and grave in tone. It was a subject for a picture. Thursday, Jan. 8. Commenced a picture 18 x 24 which I call "Solitaire." A lady sitting by a window playing solitaire. Gertrude sat for me in her black purple costume. Monday, Jan. 12. Painted during the forenoon on details of my picture, finishing and changing the land- scape out the window. . ... Received letters from Eastman Johnson, Moore and Girard. Eastman wrote in a hurry but expressing no surprise that I was trying figures. Moore wrote in rather an injured tone and sending me $130. I replied immediately to the effect that I was the one to complain and not he. Friday, Jan. 23. Eastman Johnson came this afternoon to see my figures. I have been very anxious to hear his opinion for I knew he would be frank and on his encouragement or adverse criticism my ambition in the line of figures would be largely determined. When I showed him the first one he was really surprised and most agreeably said he, it is a great deal better than I imagined you could do - ten times better and com- mended it very highly to my great delight. Criticized a few things but on the whole was much gratified. He liked the Solitaire also but pointed out some errors of drawing as I had supposed but after all encouraged me more than I had reason to hope. I feel so good over what he said and shall go at it tomorrow and carry out some of his suggestions. I went up and dined with him and he showed me his summer's work which is very interesting. Tuesday, Jan. 27. Whittredge came in to tell me that he had a little daughter born last night. Mr. Hedian159 an art dealer from Baltimore called and after speaking in a very flattering manner of my work ended by offering me $150 for a picture I ask $300 for. Wednesday, Jan. 28. After breakfast went up to Eastman's to see him on perspective and after I got back worked a little. Mrs. Stone160 took her picture today. I did not see her. I believe it is to be given to Col. Hay for a wedding present. He is to be married in Cleveland. Fitch, Hall, Gifford and I dined in Fitch's room after which I came to my room and wrote to Gertrude. Guy came in today. My little figure was on the easel. He looked at it but made no remark. J. G. Brown161 came in and was apparently interested in it and spoke very pleasantly of it. Perhaps Guy didn't know I did it, or perhaps it didn't please him. I don't think he ever does such things maliciously. Thursday, Jan. 29. Mr. Moore called. Wants more pictures. Showed him my figures which seemed to surprise him very much. Wants me to send my last landscape up to his room on Saturday to show to some gentlemen who are coming to see one of Eastman Johnson's. Just before he left Mr. Hedian came in and took my little winter picture, "Saturday Afternoon" for $200 without frame. Have worked the most of the day on my Solitaire. Took it up in the parlor where I had plenty of room to manage my perspective and drew in and painted the carpet and corrected it generally. Hope to finish it now so as to go at my Academy picture. Thursday, Feb. 3. My father and mother came down today. I dined with them at Mary's and in the evening we all went to see Sara receive her diploma and her degree as Doctor of Medicine. It was quite an interest- ing occasion but the room was too small for the audience and many were obliged to go away .... Avery called on me. He said if I had anything I wanted to sell he would like to have it at his place. I told him I had plenty to sell but that he preferred to invest his money in foreign pictures, which seemed to hit him pretty hard. He is a most unsatisfactory man for me to meet. I wish one dealer could arise that a candid man could talk with in an open candid way. I always feel like a criminal and a poor sort of fellow after talking with Avery. He never lets you see that he takes the least interest. 159. Thomas Hedian, partner in the Baltimore firm of Myers and Hedian, Paintings and Fine Arts. 160. Julia Ann Gleason Stone, wife of the Cleveland railroad builder Amasa Stone. Their daughter Clara married John Hay in January 1874. 161. John George Brown (1831-1913) studied art in England and Scotland before emigrating to America in 1853. He later opened a studio in the Studio Building and painted enormously popular genre scenes of street urchins. 23</page><page sequence="24">John Kensett (1864) Launt Thompson (ca.1868) Worthington Whittredge (ca.1864) Sanford Gifford (ca.1872) 24</page><page sequence="25">Sunday, Feb. 8. Went to the monthly meeting of the Century and staid until after midnight. Vaux's plan for the Centennial was there and was much admired. It strikes me as a remarkably fine and original building. I sent a little Hudson River picture. Avery asked my price for a little late Autumn I have here in my studio and I told him to come to my room and we would talk about it. There was an article in the Tribune yesterday morning saying that Edwin Booth had gone into bankruptcy and has lost everything. I saw Thomp- son at the club last night and he corroborated it. It gave me a great shock. I have written to Booth today about the money I owe him and about which he has been so kind. I asked him if it would be of any service to him, if he had any creditor whom he was particularly anxious to secure, any one to whom he was peculiarly bound, to take my little place in the country and pledge it for the balance of its value above the mortgage. If it would I offered it freely asking no security but his honor and his sure future, having no fear that he would not return it to me. Thursday, Feb. 12. Went to the Academy last evening to the stated meeting. Matters relating to the coming exhibition were discussed and a proper feeling of interest was manifested. Was in the Water Color Exhibition a few minutes. They have a very creditable exhibition and the public seems interested in it and a number of pictures have been sold. Commenced a picture of the "Bass Rocks" Cape Ann, foggy day, this morning and worked closely all day getting it all in early in the afternoon so that I can easily finish it now. It is my Academy picture. Two gentlemen from Baltimore called in the afternoon, Mr. Stillman and Mr. Senff.162 Mr. Stillman said George Coale wanted him to see my pictures. I showed them all to him but I don't think he was much interested in them. I think Mr. Senff had more appreciation. I finally showed him my figures and he immediately wanted to buy the little one and asked my price. I couldn't tell him as I had not thought of that. He told me to let him know when I had made up my mind. I had a very pleasant talk with them. They seemed to be genial men and I think I impressed them pleasantly. Saturday, Feb. 14. John Weir came in and lunched with us after which we went up to see Thompson's statue of the first president of Yale College, which I think one of Thompson's best works. . . . I went to the Lotus Club to a reception to Charles Kingsley.163 It was late when I reached there and he had gone. Was invited to join the club as one of seven leading artists, to become a life member at no cost except to give a sketch if I chose. Thursday, Feb. 17. Mr. Holt164 came this morning with Mr. and Mrs. James165 and another lady. They all seemed to like my November best but didn't buy. They went from here to Gifford's room and I am quite sure his pictures will please them better than mine. I don't think they saw much in mine. Hubbard spoke to Mr. Olyphant about my November and told him he ought to buy it. He said if Hubbard could have it at his room he would come and see it. I declined. Wednesday, Feb. 18. Quite contrary to my expectation Mr. Holt and Mr. James came in this morning and Mr. James said as he had found no picture to please him more than my "November" he would take it. He also said that if Mr. Stillman did not take the figure picture he thought he would like it. I think he has secured my best picture for half its value although he paid me all I asked him. In the evening I attended a very delightful gentlemen's party at Robert Gor- don's.166 Received such a genuine friendly letter from Booth in answer to one I wrote him. He has the true metal and I am proud to have him believe in me. A jolly letter from Weir telling us he had invited some company to meet us on Saturday night, and asking Gifford to come along. Saw Gifford and he thinks he will go. Thursday, Feb. 19. Attended Mrs. Youman's party to Col. Hay and his bride. Mrs. Hay is a very fine looking woman. Had a pleasant talk with Mrs. Junius Henri Browne.167 Old Mr. Bryant was there. Mrs. Godwin says he is always ready to go out in the evening. Gertrude was too tired to go which I regretted as there were many inquiries about her. I discovered Mrs. Launt Thompson late in the evening in hiding behind her fan in a corner. She didn't seem to be having a good time. Saturday, Feb. 28. Church and his wife called. He gave us tickets for the opera matinee on Friday and we went with them to see "Aida." It is a beautiful opera and gave great pleasure from beginning to end both in its music and the perfect manner in which it is put on the stage. .. . Mr. Williams Jr. of Boston called to see me on Friday. He would I think have bought my little figure on the bridge had I not been somewhat bound to Mr. James. Is coming here again next week when I can give him an answer. I bought a quaint little old fashioned toilet mirror on Friday at Gra- hams and it has suggested a picture to me of a boy 162. Charles H. Senff, a Baltimore collector. 163. Charles Kingsley (1819-1875), well-known Victorian novelist. 164. Probably Henry Holt (1840-1926), originally from Baltimore and already well launched on his publishing career. 165. Henry James (1821-1897), a prominent Baltimore lumber merchant and banker. 166. Robert Gordon was an English merchant who lived in New York for many years before returning to England in the early 1880's. He was an active patron of American artists. 167. Wife of a celebrated journalist of the day. 25</page><page sequence="26">shaving himself as all boys do, secretly to encourage a beard. Saturday, March 7. I had a very pleasant call from Governor Howard168 of Rhode Island, Mr. Chase169 and their wives. Bradford who deals in governors and crowned heads brought them in. They looked at all my pictures and seemed to enjoy their visit. One remark they made about my Solitaire pleased me as it has been said before by some of the Artists (Irving for one today) that it gave an idea of quiet elegance. It is something nowadays to escape the vulgar and the common. The governor said he should come to see me again and asked me if I would be at the club in the evening. I did meet him there again (this evening being the monthly meeting) and had a very pleasant talk with him. He lives at Newport and spoke of the pleasure he found in his winter walks there and gave me a cordial invitation to come there to see him when he would take great pleasure in going about with me as he knew familiarly all the places which would charm an artist. I took an instinctive liking to him and I fancy I interested him. I was also introduced to Hon. John Bigelow170 our former Minister to France who asked Whittredge to introduce him to me. I found him an easy man to talk with as he certainly is an interesting one. . . . I had a very enjoyable evening such as one can find nowhere so well as at the Century. General Schenck171 our present Minister to England was there. I did not ask to be introduced to him as there was a throng about him and I don't want to be thrust at distinguished people unless I have an opportunity to talk with them. Tuesday, March 24. I went up to Eastman Johnson's this morning to see if he would go up to Rondout with me on Saturday which he has promised to do. I met him on his way down town and walked with him down to 34th St. to Thom's gallery after which we walked back to his house. We had a talk about his Cranberry Picking picture which he is working on and a rambling conversation on various matters. We spoke of the necessity of valuing our pictures more highly by not being so ready to exhibit them at clubs and other places merely to amuse people but to bend all our efforts towards a fine exhibition once a year at the Academy. We both hope much from the coming exhibition at the Academy in the way of creating renewed respect for American Art. All indications go to show that we will have a full and fine exhibition and I am very much interested to see the effect which it cannot fail to have. Another thing which I have always insisted on is that artists should always stand up for the dignity of their profession and not quietly listen to the conceited utterances of igno- rant people who presume to set themselves up as authorities the moment they buy a few pictures. I have met with instances of this kind which were too offensive to be borne and have incurred the charge of being a churlish fellow because I would not quietly listen to it. Thursday, March 26. Weir came and brought his picture of the "Confessional" which he has in Fitch's room. Gertrude and I went in to see it. I liked it much better than I feared I should. I think it an exceedingly good picture. From there we went to Gifford's room, to Whittredge's and to Hubbard's. Friday, March 27. I sent my pictures to the Academy today. Four in all. "Cape Ann" 24 x 42 for sale, price $1250. "Deans River" 16 x 26, price $600. "Solitaire" 18 x 211/2, price $600; and "A Wood Path" belonging to Henry James, Esq. Weir dined with us and Gifford came in in the evening to get us to go to the Art Museum where we were invited to a reception, the occasion being to see the "Last Summer's work of Kensett" presented to the Museum by Thomas Kensett and the pictures of the "Cross and the World" of Cole presented by Colyer.172 I begin to be tired of crowds and didn't go. Tuesday, March 31. Mr. Durand was over and Fitch invited Gifford, Whittredge, Hubbard, Hall and me to lunch with him. The old gentleman looked remark- ably well and enjoyed meeting his artist friends. Mr. Stillman of Baltimore called with his wife but I did not see him. . . . I called on Mrs. Church last evening at Mr. De Forest's but they had gone to the opera. We think there is a coolness on their part towards us and do not know why. Church has been in town a week and shown a new picture and has not been near me whereas he usually comes to my studio the first thing. They have evidently mis- interpreted something. Sunday, April 5. I began a small picture of Gertrude asleep in a chair. Sent my picture of the boy shaving to the Century but I do not think it was very much liked. I went round the gallery with Eastman Johnson and he passed by it without seeing it. It amused me because I mean to have the fun of making him believe it annoyed me. Painted all day on the little picture as I am sure of not being interrupted but did not succeed very well. 168. Henry Howard (1826-1905), lawyer, industrialist, and po'itician, was governor of Rhode Island in 1873 and 1874. 169. Possibly Thomas W. Chase (1834-?), Providence merchant and minor Republican politician. 170. John Bigelow (1817-1911), noted writer and diplomat. 171. Robert Cumming Schenck (1809-1890), politician, diplomat, and writer of a definitive work on draw poker. 172. Vincent Colyer (1825-1888), portrait and landscape painter who lived near Darien, Connecticut. 26</page><page sequence="27">Tuesday, April 7. Varnishing day at the Academy. I went up there about 11 o'clock. Naturally my first anxiety ordinarily would be for my own pictures but I confess I was most anxious at this critical stage of the Academy to see what the character of the exhibition was. I was glad to find it much above the average, in fact a most interesting exhibition. My "Cape Ann" is in the large room in a good place. My "Wood Path" on the line in the West Room. My "Deans River" over another picture in the same room and looking very poorly. My "Solitaire" on which I most depended over another picture in the North Room. I feel that I have had a decided snub at the hands of the hanging committee David Johnson, Brandt,173 and Irving who took good care to have all their pictures on the line. It has made me feel a little depressed but I try to be philosophical. Poor Weir was most shamefully treated and was utterly cast down. His picture is hung over another in a dark corner and as he is an Academician and had sent only this picture I regard it as a down- right insult. Eastman Johnson came home with me. He too felt disagreeably as though he had been rather put off in by places although his pictures are all on the line neither of the three however being in the large room. Hubbard has three pictures on the line, Whittredge his large ones, Gifford three, Church one, the temple at Petra. Bierstadt a dry uninteresting California woods in one of the best places in the large gallery. However it is a good exhibition and I hope it will be the beginning of a revival in Art. After dinner I went up to the Albemarle Hotel where Weir and his wife are stopping to get them to come down and spend the evening. They were going out however and could not come. Weir had just received a telegram from New Haven telling him his picture was sold for $1600 which was great good luck under the circumstances. Thursday, April 9. Gertrude, Alice174 and I attended the Reception at the Academy last evening. It was crowded to excess in spite of the rain and a new deep interest in the Collection was evinced. Several pictures were sold during the day and the papers this morning speak most encouragingly. I went up there this morning and there were a good many people there not with- standing the rain. Everything looks favorable for a prosperous season. Tuesday, April 14. Weir and Robert Wilkinson dined with us this evening. I have been at work all day on a piece of perspective. The past week has been a de- pressing one. Nobody comes to my studio and I begin to feel the old anxiety about money matters from which I have been free all winter. I called to see Moore who was not in but came to see me yesterday. He owes me $400 but I could get no promise from him after I had urged him beyond what my conscience allowed me. I went to see Snedecar today who owes me a small sum but he could not pay me. My pictures in the Academy do not sell. I made a mistake in not putting lower prices on them but I always do the wrong thing. I told Mr. Brown in charge of the gallery that if he had any inquiries I would take much less for any of them .... The Academy is doing splendidly. Many pictures have been sold and the receipts at the door are very encouraging, from two to three hundred dollars a day. There seems a real revival in Art. The papers are encouraging. The Tribune has carefully written articles. One a day or two ago spoke in compli- mentary terms of me. I really feel however that I am not strongly represented in landscape this year much as I desired to be. I will look out for next year. Monday, April 20. I have little to record in my journal. There seems an utter stagnation in Art matters. Avery told me he did not see anyone who had any idea of buying pictures. I think the dealers are pretty well discouraged. No one comes here. It is a little re- markable that pictures should sell at the Academy where they never had sold before. They are mostly low priced pictures however. I should probably have sold my Solitaire if I had asked about $400 for it. I am sorry now the way it is hung that I put any price on it. I have painted the past week a little late Autumn with two figures, based on one of my Deans Corner studies. I think it good in color and have commenced an 18 x 30 same subject which I have been hard at work upon today. Sherwood175 spoke to me about a picture that size and when it is finished I intend to call his attention to it without much con- fidence however that he will care for it. I have to keep busy to keep from being depressed. Money anxieties begin to suggest themselves. I have been comfortable in that respect all winter and would be now if I could get what is owed to me. However I mean to try to keep up my courage. Saturday, April 25. On Wednesday I went up to see Eastman Johnson whom I found considerably worried over his work as well as his affairs. He begins for the first time in years to know some of my anxieties. I did not stay long as he was painting a portrait of a little child which was brought in by the nurse while I was there. Mr. J. T. Johnston gave his annual artists party on Friday to which I was invited but I did not go. President Grant was there. . . . Cook had a most cruel article on Hall in his Academy notice yesterday 173. Carl Ludwig Brandt (1831-1905), portrait, landscape, and historical painter who moved to New York from Germany in 1852 and was elected to the National Academy in 1872. 174. Alice Sawyer was Gertrude McEntee's sister. 175. John H. Sherwood was a lawyer, collector, and patron of the arts. In 1880 he built a studio building at 6th Avenue and 57th Street. 27</page><page sequence="28">and again today. Hall is greatly incensed. He came to my room today and showed me a caricature of him which he had made, but I hope Cook will not hear of it. Hall has sold the picture Cook ridiculed and I tried to assure him that this was a proof that such articles did not hurt him. Thursday, April 28. Went to hear Lohengren last night. A ticket for a reserved seat cost four dollars. I had a very good seat in the middle of the parquette and as there were a number of unoccupied seats about me I could not have been better placed. The music is delightful and I took great pleasure in studying Wil- son's face which is a very picturesque and paintable one. All the love scenes between her and Campanini176 were very delicate and refined. The awkwardness of the chorus and supernumeraries is a great drawback to the enjoyment of a play. It was positively painful to see some of those women walk up to the front of the stage. So awkward, so conscious. The opera was very long, commencing at 7:30 and lasting until 11 . . . The Brooklyn Art Association gave their reception last night and this morning there was a notice in the Tribune speaking of my pictures among others. Sunday, May 3. Last night was monthly meeting at the Century and it was the pleasantest gathering by far that I have attended there this winter. There was a very nice collection of pictures. I sent my "October Snow" just come home from England and a little skating scene. Several people spoke to me in praise of my snow picture and I heard it would probably be sold. I offered it at about half my usual price ($500), but if low prices will tempt buyers they shall have that inducement for a while. Tuesday, May 12. Church came to see me yesterday afternoon and stayed to dinner. He liked my Autumn with figures and told me a Mr. Walker177 of Chicago who wanted a picture of mine would probably take it. He is to write to him. I have ordered a frame for it to be done in two weeks. We went to see Moran's178 "Chasm of the Colorado" last night. I was too far from it and it was lighted by gas, but it struck me as a technically well-painted picture although one which does not embody my ideas of what is greatest in Art. Met there Dr. Holland and his daughters, Junius Henri Browne and wife, Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge,179 Clarence Cook and Moran and his wife. Moore came and paid me $100 today and I received a nice letter from John Weir full of appreciation and friendship. Thursday, May 14. Yesterday went up to Eastman Johnsons to remind him of the Academy Annual Meeting thinking he would likely have forgotten it, as he had. . . . La Farge brought up a resolution pledging the Academy to protect in a general way the right of Academicians to exhibit which produced some sharp discussion but was finally carried. The dinner, never a very good one, passed off harmoniously and Weir and Thompson came home with me and remained until 12 o'clock. Friday, May 15. Mr. Hedian of Baltimore came in today and after some higgling bought a little skating scene 9 x 15 and the study of my late Autumn with two figures 12 x 20 for $275. . . . Mrs. Bierstadt made me a very pleasant visit. They have been living in the country all winter and I have a fancy that Bierstadt's declining popularity begins to make them feel like seeking out their old friends. She looked very young and pretty and I was glad to see her.... Weir gave us this morning an interesting account of his call on M. O. Roberts180 and R. L. StuartT81 to get pictures for his coming exhibition. He says Roberts' house is knee deep in pictures from cellar to garret and that he even has them in his stable. He is going to build a large gallery this summer. Wednesday, May 20. Col. Hay came in on Saturday with Miss Stone to buy the little study of my late Autumn with figures and was much disappointed that I had sold it to Mr. Hedian. Mr. Walker the gentle- man to whom Church wrote about my late Autumn came in yesterday and looked at all my pictures and as we were under the impression that Church had gone to Hartford he proposed to come in tomorrow. However calling on Heade we found Church had not gone and he and Mr. Walker soon returned and he finally took my picture for $600 including the frame which will cost $50. Saturday, May 23. Eastman Johnson called and I walked up to 42nd St. with him. Have been sitting to Le Clear182 for several days so that he may finish my portrait begun long ago. How differently I feel from what I did a year ago. Although this has been a winter of financial depression 176. Italo Campanini (1845-1896), a popular Italian tenor who lived for some time in England and the United States. 177. Edwin Walker (1832-1910), a lawyer for Chicago railroad interests. 178. Thomas Moran (1837-1926), a landscape painter who was strongly influenced by Turner. Moran was chiefly notable for his Western mountain scenes. 179. Mary Elizabeth Mapes Dodge (1831-1905), editor of St. Nicholas Magazine for thirty years and famous as the author of Hans Brinker, was known as a woman of great intelligence and charm. 180. Marshall Owen Robert (1814-1880), a shipping magnate and Civil War profiteer, was a vigorous collector of American paintings. 181. Robert Leighton Stuart (1806-1882) was a rich sugar refiner and philanthropist who gathered a distinguished art collection. A devout Presbyterian, he strongly opposed museum attendance on Sunday. 182. Thomas Le Clear (1818-1882), portarit and genre painter who worked in Buffalo and, after 1860, in New York. 28</page><page sequence="29">Albert Bierstadt (ca.1868) I have made my usual income, been economical, paid some old debts, and shall have a little money left for the summer, which is certainly a great triumph for an artist of established reputation at the age of 46 years. I ought to be thankful that I am not in jail. Tuesday, May 26. Mr. Secor called today. This evening I received a note from him asking the price of my Kaatskill Woods. I answered his note and told him $1000. Dr. Coan called this evening. Miss Stone came in today to tell me that she would take the water color picture and was surprised that I had not received the check for it which Col. Hay had sent me yesterday. She told me that if I did not get it today to let them know tomorrow. Sent Miss Stone's picture today and wrote to Mr. Walker that his picture would go tomorrow and to remit to me at Rondout. Monday, June 1. We came home for the summer on Friday 29 two days earlier than last year.</page><page sequence="30">JERVIS McENTEE, Christmas Tree New York, Kennedy Galleries, Inc.</page></plain_text>
