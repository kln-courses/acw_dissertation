J,I 3Jj ~ The 'Abbasid poet of the "new" style realized that the Golden Age of the Jahiliyah was no more-it was the ruined abode, ir- reparably changed, the repository of old and archetypal yearnings; nothing remained but the vague traces of a tribal heritage, long since abandoned for the glories of Empire and Islam. Time has changed the poet too; in psyche and in sensibility he is no longer the bedouin warrior and lover, pouring forth his heart "in profuse strains of unpremeditated art," but the consciously cultivated lit- terateur of the Caliphal court. And yet the 'Abassid "badi-" poet returned for inspiration to the traces of the primordial dwelling whose once sweet waters now have the tearful taste of melancholy. Thus the "new" poetry was still nourished from the traditional tribal well-spring of Arabic literature, but it was changed by the passage of time, the relentless march of history, to consciously and self-consciously reflect the urban Islamic culture of the 'Abassid empire. The so-called "badi-" poetry that emerged in late second and early third century Basra and Baghdad was the recognition and expression in literature of this irrevocable change. As such it was welcomed by those who revelled in the headlong rush into a new era, but it came as a threat to those who cherished the illusion of continuity with Jahiliyah times and preferred to remain under the protective wing of the Golden Age. Ibn al-Mu'tazz is credited with the first critical formulation of a definition of the new poetry in his Kitdb al-Badi&lt;f (274 H.). His definition of the literary phenomenon in terms of already existing rhetorical devices became the basis for all later criticism of badi-f I Dftwan Abz Tamman bi-sharh al-Kha.tib al- Tibrizi, 4 vols. ed.

His theory has been expounded and expanded, analyzed and psycho-analyzed but never challenged, superceded or dis- carded. I would like to demonstrate that the concept of "badi-" as pro- pounded by Ibn al-Muctazz is fundamentally inadequate, and that to arrive at an adequate and coherent formulation of the nature of the new poetry, we must first return to the fertile second century Basran soil from which it sprang. The term "badi-" appeared in the third century hljra to describe the innovative style of certain cAbbasid poets, the beginning of which was generally attributed to Bashshar ibn Burd (d. 167/8 H.) or Muslim ibn al-Walld (d. 208 H.). The term was not at first defined, but apparently indicated the novel, innovative quality of the poetry.2 The word itself is related to the verb abdaca IV to originate, invent, bring into existence for the first time that which did not exist before. Hence, badi-c (in the meaning offdcil I or muf il IV) is one of the epithets of God, meaning "the Originator of the creation." And badif- (in the meaning of mafuil I) as an adjective thus means "Originated; invented; made, done, produced ... new- ly, for the first time ... new, wonderful, unknown before. "3 Of note here also is bidcah, innovation in the realm of religion and theology, which is to say, heresy. In the Kitab al-AghalnT, Abiu al-Faraj al-Isfahani credits Muslim ibn al-Walld with the introduction of the term: Muslim ibn al-Walld ... was an early cAbbasid poet, born and raised in Kufa. He is, so they claim, the first one to have composed what is known as "badf'" poetry, and he termed this type [of poetry] novel (bad-') and refined. He had a group of followers, and the most famous of them was Abfu Tammam al-Ta-'i, for he composed all of his poetry in that manner.4 2 This discussion follows in part the chapter on "badic" in: Ahmad Matliub, Mus.talaha-t Baldaghtyah (Baghdad: al-Majmac al-cIlmi al-clraqi, 1972), pp. 80-95. 3 Edward William Lane, An Arabic-English Lexicon 8 vols. (Beirut: Librairie du Liban, 1968) Vol. 1, pp. 166-167. We might also note the common etymology of "badi"' and "bidcah" -"an innovation, a novelty ... an addition or an impair- ment, in religion ... generally a heretical innovation" -which may in part explain the negative and "heretical" connotation which the literary term later began to assume. 4 Abtu al-Faraj al-Isfahanil, Kita-b al-Agha-ni-, 24 vols. ed. cAbd al-Karim al- cIzbawi (Cairo: al-Hay'ah al-Misriyah al-cAmmah li-al-Kitab, 1963-1974) Vol. 19, p. 31.</page><page sequence="3">TOWARD A REDEFINITION OF "BADI"' POETRY 3 He cites as well a less favorable opinion of the new poetry: "The first one to corrupt poetry was Muslim ibn al-Walid. He produced what people called 'badf-'. Then came [Abui Tammam] al-Ta'i after him and mastered and varied it. "5 Yet another anecdote from the Kitab al-Aghanf supports the view that the badi" poets had struck out in new directions and applauds this trend: Hashim ibn Muhammad informed me, saying, al-Riyashi told me that al-)Asmali was asked who was the better poet, Bashshar or Marwan? He replied, Bashshar. When asked the reason for this, he said it was because Marwan took a road that many others had taken and did not overtake those who had preceded him, and the same is true of his contemporaries. But Bashshar took an untravelled road and excelled in it and was unequalled in it; and he is the greater in versatility and in the genres of poetry and has a greater abundance and broader scope of badi", whereas Marwan never went beyond the manner followed by the Ancients.6 However, our earliest and most insightful remarks on badiCf are those of al-Jahiz in al-Bayan wa al-Tabyfn. Although he does not define the term explicitly, al-Jahiz' comments on lines by al- Ashhab ibn Rumaylah and al-RaCl indicate that he had a specific idea in mind: al-Ashhab ibn Rumavlah said ... J -.~., 0- J1 ii- f , * XLs si1 jA.1 Acle They are the fore-arm of fate, for which it is feared And what good is a hand that is not lent weight by a [mighty] fore- arm? His phrase "they are the fore-arm of fate" is a metaphor (mathal) and this is what the transmitters of poetry call badi'. And al-RalC said: - v ) O O 10 - - W.

When we note that al-Jahiz was one of the Basran school of Mu'tazilites, the underscored line becomes the key to understand- ing his concept of badi-. As a consequence of their doctrine of tawhid (the affirmation of the unity of God), the Mu'tazilah were forced to interpret the anthropomorphic statements (tashbih, tajsim) of the Qur'an and the Hadith by means of ta'wil, that is, as metaphor or metonymy. Al-Shahrastani in al-Milal wa-al-Nihal describes this doctrine as follows: [The Mu'tazilah] were agreed in denying the vision of God the ex- alted by eyesight in the world to come, and in denying the likening (tashbih) [of Him to anything] in every respect: direction, place, form, body, seclusion, locomotion, cessation, change and perception; and they require the [metaphorical] interpretation (ta'wt) of the verses that are ambiguous in these respects, and they call this method the profession of the unity of God (tawhid).9 Two examples from al-Ashlari's Maqdldt al-Isldmiyin will illustrate the exegetical method by which al-Jahiz would have understood "The razor of God is the sharpest and the fore-arm of God is the strongest": [The Muctazilahl differ with regard to the question: Can it be said that God has a face, or not? They are of three groups. The first group claim that God has a face that is He [Himselfl. Abfu Hudhayl is the one who says this. The second group claim that: We say "face" by extension, and we revert to the affirmation of God because we attest to a face that is He. This is because the Arabs put the face in the place of the thing, so that one says: "If it were not for your face, I would not have done it," that is, "if it were not for you, I would not have done it". This is the doctrine of al-Nazzam and most of the Mu'tazilah of Basra, and the doctrine of the Mu'tazilah of Baghdad .... The Mu'tazilah agree unanimously in denying the attribution of an eye and a hand to God and in this they are divided into two doc- 7 (Amr ibn Bahr al-Jahiz, al-Baydn wa-al-Tabytn, 4 vols. ed. CAbd al-Salam Muhammad Haruin (Cairo: Maktabat al-Khanji, 1968), Vol. 4, pp. 55-56. Curiously, Matlfb omits the underscored line and thereby misses the whole point of al-Jahiz' discussion (Matlab, Mustalahdt Baldghtyah, p. 81).

They take this to mean that the hand is grace, and they take the meaning of the eye to be that He intended knowledge and that He is knowing. [Thus] they interpret the saying -- ,- of God the Mighty and Great: - j Cj (Qur'an 20:39): "And that you be created in my eye sight" as "with my know- ledge. "'0 Thus, for al-Jahiz, badi", though it may have been a new phenomenon in poetry, was not new to the Arabic language. But rather, from his Mu'tazilite point of view, it was not only an outstanding stylistic device found in the Qur'an"I and Hadith, but also a method of interpretation, a way of thinking, that was obligatory upon the faithful for the proper understanding of those religious scriptures. Hence, what al-Jahiz meant by badiC in the excerpt from al-Bayan wa-al-TabyTn quoted above was the use of metonymy or metaphor, or more explicitly, the personification of the abstract as he understood it by analogy to the Muctazilite exegetical use of ta'wdl. I should then like to extrapolate from al-Jahiz' example and propose that badif poetry be defined not merely by the occurrence of this particular type of rhetorical device, but rather that the badf- style is nothing less than the expression in poetry of the entire scope of the metaphorical and analytical processes that characterized Muctazilite speculative theology (kaldm) and, in a broader sense, the whole cultural and intellectual framework of the era of Muctazilite hegemony. The circumstantial evidence is in itself convincing. Two Basrans, Wasil ibn (Ata' (d. 131 H.) and cAmr ibn cUbayd (d. 144 H.) are traditionally credited with the founding of the Basran school of the Muctazilah. Among their acquaintances was the renowned zindiq and debauchee Bashshar ibn Burd who is generally considered the originator of badi" poetry. Al-Jahiz writes of him with great admira- tion: lo Abui al-Hasan 'All ibn IsmiclI al-Ashcari, Kitdb Maqdldl al-Is1dmiyin wa-IkhtiCaf al-Musallin, ed. Helilmut Ritter, (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag GMBH, 1963) pp. 189 and 195. II This is related to al-Jahiz' concept of the inimitability of the Qur'anic style ('i&amp;dz al-Qur'an), for a discussion of which see Goldziher, Koranauslegung, p. 121.</page><page sequence="6">6 TOWARD A REDEFINITION OF BADI'' POE I'RY Those naturally gifted in poetry among the Moderns are Bashshar [ibn Burd] al-'Uqayll, al-Sayyid al-Himyarli, AbLu al-CAtahiyah and Ibn Abi CUyaynah. In this category people have mentioned Yahya ibn Nawfal, Salman al-Khasir and Khalaf ibn Khallfah, but Aban ibn CAbd al-Hamid al-Lahiq1 is more worthy [of being called] talented than this latter group, and Bashshar is the most gifted of them all .... Al-CAttabli followed Bashshar's footsteps in badi&lt;, and there is no one among the Moderns better in bad( than Bashshar and Ibn Harmah. 1' It is worth noting that for al-Jahiz there is no contradiction be- tween a poet being naturally gifted (ma.tbu'c) and writing in the badi"' style, as later critics claimed. On the contrary, al-Jahiz finds Bashshar the best in both categories. To return to the main argument, Bashshar, although not a Muctazilite himself, frequented the same majlis as Wasil ibn cAta' and 'Amr ibn 'Ubayd. Just how culturally and religiously heterodox Basran society in the late second and early third cen- turies hira was is clear from this anecdote from the Kitab al-Agha/ni: I3 There were in Basra six masters of kaldm: 'Amr ibn 'Ubayd, Wasil ibn CAta', Bashshar the Blind, $alih ibn cAbd al-Quddfis, CAbd al- Karim ibn Abi al-'Awja' and a man from al-Azd-who Abu Ahmad said wasJarir ibn Hazim-and they used to gather in the house of the Azdi and hold their disputations there. As for cAmr and Wasil, they ended up among the MuCtazilah; and as for CAbd al-Karim and $lih, they properly repented; Bashshar on the other hand remained perplexed and confused, while the Azdi was inclined toward the doc- trine of the Sumaniyah [a sect of Indian metempsychosists]-one of the sects of India-and he made no attempt to hide his beliefs. 'Abd al-Karim was a corrupter of youths, until CAmr ibn CUbayd said to him: "I have heard that you are intimate with one of our youths, cor- rupting him ... and leading him into your religion. So either leave our city, or I will do my utmost to get rid of you." So he betook himself to Kufa where Muhammad ibn Sulayman, having been directed against him, killed and crucified him. It is of him that Bashshar said: sjG y ,; 9 a SS ,J 6 Say to CAbd al-Karim, "O Ibn Abi al-'Awja' You have sold Islam for Kufr out of stupidity.

Among the Shi'ite sects represented there, Pellat mentions the Mughiriyah, the Kamiliyah, the Kaysaniyah and the Mukhtariyah; there were as well several denominations of Khari- jites, and the Murji'ites. Outside the pale of Islam were the Zanadi- qah. This term is an imprecise one encompassing various sorts of heretics. At this period it probably referred to those among the Shuubliyah who embraced old Persian beliefs, including Manichaean, Magean and Mazdaean elements.15 Considering the extensive un- and anti-Islamic presence in the Basran milieu, it is not surprising that the Mu'tazilites added to their original polemic against the Rafidites and extremist Shicites a vigorous polemic against Zandaqah, and especially against thanaw-yah (dualism), which, according to Nyberg, should be understood as Manichaean views. 16 It was the Muctazilite adoption of "philosophical" methods to defend Islam against these heresies that introduced speculative theology (kaldm) into Islamic theology. Al-Shahrastani in al-Milal wa-al-Nihal describes this development as follows: The Qadariyah began their heresy in the time of Hasan, and Wasil seceded ictazala from them and from his master because of his doctrine of the position between the two positions (al-manzilah bayna al- manzilatayn). He and his followers were then called Muctazilah .... 14 Kztdb al-Aghadni, Vol. 3, pp. 146-147.

When the days of al-Ma'mfin unfolded, they mixed their methods with the methods of Kaldm singling it out as one of the branches of science and calling it Kalam-either because the most con- spicuous problem that they debated and discussed was the problem of the speech (kaldm) [of God], so that this type [of disputation] was named for it, or because of their comparing themselves to the philosophers who named one of the branches of their science logic (al-mantiq), and logic and kaldm are synonymous.'7 This speculative thought was then transplanted into the realm of literature. In al-Baydn wa-al-Tabyin, al-Jahiz has recorded an initial stage of this process in the poetic-polemic exchange between the zindiq Bashshar ibn Burd and the Mu'tazilite poet $afwan al- Ansdri.'8 Of Bashshar's poem, which attempts to prove the superiority of fire to earth, only one line has come down to us: J !J 5 a ?-o Ju 9- a-J J Li I *,W ., gj S-v , JI Dark is the earth, bright is the fire, And fire has been worshipped ever since there was Fire.'9 Of the rest of the poem we get at least a partial reflection in $afwan al-Ansari's reply. His retort is characterized by a curious and appealing mixture of the various elements of the classical Arabic qasidah. Its genres and motifs are now metamorphosed into a powerful polemic defending Earth and Islam against Fire and Kufr. $afwdn opens the poem addressing Bashshar: i - O ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ .) ... *og - 8 O You claim that as element fire is nobler, [But] it lives in the earth, in rock and flint.

Furthermore, they reveal that the outstanding features of that poetry are not so much rhetorical devices as 1) the incorporation of the principles of logical and theological disputation; and 2) the free metaphorical manipula- tion of traditional genre and motival elements to express contem- porary social and cultural ideas-in this case the leading politico- religious issue of the day, Islam versus Zandaqah. It was in the first half of the third century hijra during the caliphates of al-Ma'muin, al-Mu'tasim and al-Wathiq that the Muctazilah reached the peak of their political power. In 212 H. al- Ma'miun, who was noted for his keen interest in theology, publicly adopted the doctrine of the created Qur'an, thereby ushering in an era in which Muctazilite thought set the cultural tone. In 217 H. al- 20 Day,sn was the founder of the Daysaniyah sect of the dualist Maj-usis (al- Jahiz, al-Baydn wa-al- Tabyin, Vol. 1, p. 29, note 3). 21 al-Jahiz, al-Baydn wa-al-Tabyin, Vol. 1, pp. 27-30, has quoted $afwan al- An?ri's poem in full. For a partial translation and discussion see Pellat, Le milieu basrien, pp. 176-177.</page><page sequence="11">TOWARD A REDEFINITION OF "BADI"' POETRY 11 Ma'miun appointed Ibn Abi Du'ad Qdadi al-Quadt (chief qdaz) and made the tenet of the created Qur'an obligatory on his subjects, thus initiating the mihnah, or inquisition, which gained notoriety for its persecution of Ahmad ibn Hanbal. Ibn Abi Du'ad remained in the position of Chief Qa7di under al-MuCtasim and al-Wathiq and was finally replaced during al-Mutawakkil's caliphate due to ill health. The period of Mu'tazilite hegemony was not destined to last for long. Al-Wathiq gave up his belief in the created Qur'an shortly before his death in 232 H. The end of the Mu'tazilite era was signalled in 234 H. when al-Mutawakkil ended the mihnah and for- bade the profession of the created Qur'an on pain of death.22 Further weight is added to the argument for the connection between Muctazilism, kaldm, and badic poetry by the fact that the most radical of the badic poets, Abtu Tammam, flourished during precisely this period. He counted among his mamdiah4n all three of the Muctazilite caliphs, but especially al-Mu'tasim to whom many of his best mature qasidahs are dedicated. His Diwan contains as well many poems dedicated to Ibn Abi Du'ad, the poet-vizier al- Zayyat and many of al-Muctasim's courtiers and generals. Further- more, Abua Tammam's outstanding qasidahs, for example the Ode on cAmmuiriyah and the Ode on the Burning of al-Afshin23 display not only the types of metaphor and metonymy the origin of which can be traced to Muctazilite exegesis but are also characterized in both form and content by the same dialectic between Islam and Kufr that is found in the polemical poetry of Bashshar ibn Burd and $afwan al-Ans5ri. Perhaps it was al-Muctasim's awareness of this Basran connection that led to his quip in the following anecdote: Al-Hasan ibn Wahb said: I said to Abul Tammam: "Did al-Muctasim understand anything of your poetry?" He replied, "He asked me to repeat three times the line: 22 Walter M. Patton, Ahmed ibn Hanbal and the Mihna (Leiden: E. J.

He deemed it good and said to Ibn Abi Du'ad, "O Abfi cAbd Allah, [Abfi Tammam] al-Ta'i is more like the Basrans than the Syrians! "24 That is, Abiu Tammam's poetry was more akin to the kaldm of the Basran Muctazilites than to the Umayyad lyricism of his native Syria. If we turn then to al-Jahiz' remarks on kalam, we shall see that the cultivated litterateur writing in the midst of the Muctazilite era was aware of the interrelationship of the parallel developments of the arts and sciences, and that for him badia poetry was not alien and artificial but a natural and organic product and expression of those advances: [The Mutakallimuin] selected ... expressions for their concepts and they derived names for them from the speech of the Arabs and adopted ter- minology for things for which there was no word in the language of the Arabs. Thus they have set the precedent in this for all those who came after, and the model for all who followed. So they say accident (carad) and essence (jawhar); to be (aysa) and not to be (laysa). They distinguish between nullity (bu.tldn) and annihilation (talashin), and they mention "thisness" (haddhyah), identity (huwtyah), and quiddity (mdhiyah). In the same way Khalil ibn Ahmad attached names to the metres of the qasfdahs ... whereas the Arabs had not known those metres by those names .... Similarly the grammarians named and referred to the circumstantial accusative (Ml) and adverbial ac- cusatives (zuruf) and such things .... The mathematicians, too, draw upon names which they designate as signs in order to understand one another .... [The people] say it is unseemly to say, as someone delivering a sermon on a great and mighty minbar said, "Then God ... after he brought forth the creation and arranged them and made them firm, annihilated them, and so they were annihilated (ldshahum fataldshaw)." If the mutakallim had not needed to express the concept of annihilation (taldshin), it would have been inappropriate. Someone else preaching before the Caliph said, "And God brought him out of the door of nonbeing (laystyah) and made him enter the door of being (ays4yah)." These expressions are permissible in the art of kaldm when existing words lack the required range of meaning. The expressions of 24 Abiu Bakr Muhammad ibn Yahya al-$fili, Akhba-r Abi Tammam, ed.

Besides this conception of a historical process, al-Jahiz is aware of the relationship between the ideas of the Mutakallimun and the work of the grammarians in systematizing Arabic grammar and prosody. Furthermore, far from isolating these disciplines from the arts, al-Jahiz documents and approves of the introduction of new terms and new ideas into both prose and poetry. The link between bad- poetry and Muctazilite thought is further supported by the inability of critics writing during the period of or- thodox resurgence that followed the Muctazilite era to arrive at an adequate understanding of Abui Tammam's poetry in particular and, in general, to formulate any valid concept of the badi' style. It was as though when Muctazilite exegesis was rejected the tools for understanding and appreciating badi' poetry were lost. The effect of the return to orthodoxy on the understanding of badi' poetry will be clear from an examination of Ibn al-Muctazz' Kitab al-Badi". Ibn al Muctazz (d. 296 H.) was an cAbbasid prince who ruled for one day as the Caliph al-Muntasif bi-Allah. He was himself a poet as well as a literary critic and man of letters. His 25 al-Jabiz, al-Baydn wa-al-Tabytn, Vol. 1, pp. 139-141.</page><page sequence="14">14 TOWARD A REDEFINITION OF "BADI1'' POETRY Kitdb al-Badi" written in 274 H. is the first critical attempt to define the new poetry, and as such it established precedents which were closely adhered to by later critics.26 Ibn al-Muctazz was concerned with validating or legitimizing the new poetry, the detractors of which claimed that it was outside the bounds of the Arabic poetic tradition or represented a corruption of that tradition. Lacking any concept of the growth or evolution of that literary tradition, Ibn al-Muctazz rests his defense on two bases: 1) that the badi-f style consists merely of the proliferation of certain definable rhetorical devices and embellishments, and 2) that these devices are not innovations introduced into the Arabic language by the badiff poets, but are to be found in the classical sources of the Arabic language: the Qur'an, Hadith, the sayings of the Companions of the Prophet, Ancient poetry and the speech of the desert Arabs. The inherently reactionary philosophy of Ibn al- Muctazz is signalled by his obeisance to the hierarchy of religious/ philological authorities in the opening sentence of the book:27 We have presented in the chapters of this book of ours some of what we have found in the Qur'an, the classical language (al-lughah) and 26 'Abd Allah Ibn al-MuCtazz, Kitib al-Badi", ed. Ignatius Kratchkovsky, E. J. W. Gibb Memorial Series, N.S. 10. (London: Messrs. Luzac and Co., 1935), Kratchkovsky's introduction, p. 6. 27 I think that my argument that the Kitab al-Badi" is a product of the reaction against Mu"tazilism is more to the point than Trabulsi's argument that it is a reac- tion against Aristotle's Rhetoric and shows anti-Hellenistic and anti-Shu'ubiyah tendencies (Amjad Trabulsl, La critique poetique des Arabesjusqu 'au V sicle de l'Hc'gire (Damascus, 1956) pp. 78-81). As for the question that Bonebakker deals with, i.e., to what extent did the early theologians, especially the Mu'tazilites (for example al-Jahiz [Al-Baydn wa-al-Tabyinj and Bishr ibn al-MuCtamir [Sahafahj contribute to Ibn al-Mu'tazz' theory of badi", I am in agreement with Bonebakker that: The prototypes of this theory, as we have seen, appeared much earlier in the form of well-defined and clearly-illustrated technical terms used by philologists and poets. To these early discussions of terminology Ibn al- Mu'tazz's book, it seems to me, shows a much closer affinity than to the works of Jihiz and Ibn Qutayba, in spite of Ibn al-Muctazz's admission that he borrowed the term madhhab kaldmf from the first author. (Seeger A. Bonebakker, "Reflections on the Ki'tab a(-Badi( of Ibn al-Mu'tazz," Atli del terzo Congresso di studi arabi c islamici, (Naples, 1967) p. 207). Indeed, as I shall at- tempt to show, the fact that Ibn al-Multazz borrowed al-Jahiz's term al-madhhab al- kaidmi, which in the MuCtazilite context signified a mode of thought or analysis, to refer to a rhetorical device demonstrates his misunderstanding of the Muctazilite man of letters rather than al-Jahiz's influence on him. What my argument finally amounts to is that "badit" poetry is poetry written in al-madhhab al-kaldmi- as al- Jahiz understood it.</page><page sequence="15">TOWARD A REDEFINITION OF "BADI' POETRY 15 the Hadith of the Prophet, may God bless him, and the speech of the Companions and the desert Arabs and others, and in the poetry of the Ancients of that speech which the Moderns call badi"; that you might know what Bashshar and Muslim and Abfi Nuwas and those that resemble them and follow their path were not the first to produce this art, but rather it abounded in their poetry and so became known in their time, until it was called by this name and expressed and in- dicated [this art].28 In his zeal to legitimize badi"f poetry, Ibn al-Mu'tazz has thus stripped it of its very identity-its newness, its novelty. What is described in the Kitab al-Agh.dni as novel and innovative and by al-Jahiz as a unique feature of the Arabic tongue that enables it to strike out in new directions is reduced to a mere proliferation of pre-existing formulae. Still, Ibn al-Muctazz realizes that there is some difference be- tween the old poetry and the new. This he attributes primarily to lack of discretion, over-zealousness, what is, in the end, poor taste. Then, after them, came [Abfu Tammam] Habib ibn Aws al-Td'i. He became infatuated with badi"f until he had mastered it, branched out in it and used it constantly. In some of it he did well, and in some, poor- ly. And this, in my opinion, is excessive and the result of immodera- tion. Rather a poet used to compose a verse or two of this art in a qasidah. Sometimes you could read a number of qasidahs by one of them without coming across a single verse of badic; this was con- sidered admirable among them when it occurred sparsely, and even more felicitous when it occurred in unconstrained speech.29 The author then continues his introduction by giving a few ex- amples: An example of badic speech is the saying of God the Exalted: v 5 - v _ _ ' J+ J Li,d _,L&lt;J1 Ai 3 4!jI (Qur'an, 43:3) "Indeed in the Mother of the Book before us it is sublime, wise.

And this is the borrowing (isticdrah) of a word for something which is not known by it from something which is known by it, like the Mother of the Book, and the wing of mercy, or like saying: 28 Ibn al-Muctazz, Kitdb al-Badfl, p. 1. 29 Ibid.</page><page sequence="16">16 TOWARD A REDEFINITION OF "BADI"' POET RY ,j ,A0 "Thought is the marrow of action."

They were not invented by the Moderns and the same holds true for the fourth and fifth categories of badi.'30 Ibn al-Muctazz' only concession to any other interpretation or definition of the badi- style is that there may be some variation in the number or classification of the rhetorical figures.31 The rest of the book is divided into five chapters, one on each of the admittedly arbitrarily chosen rhetorical figures: istiCdrah (metaphor); tajni-s (paranomasia); mu.tabaqah (antithesis), radd al- cajuz cald al-sadr (repetition of a word from the beginning of a phrase or verse at the end); and al-madhhab al-kaldmf (the method of kalam).32 These five chapters are followed by a section dealing with twelve mahazsin (embellishments) which, declares Ibn al-Muctazz, others may include as bases of badit although he has chosen not to.33 The text, after an initial definition or description of the figure to be discussed in each chapter, is nothing more than a mechanical, albeit learned, display of examples arranged in a hierarchy from the most authoritative source to the least, i.e., the Qur'an, the Hadith, the sayings of the Companions of the Prophet, the poetry and prose of the Ancients, the poetry and prose of the Moderns. After the praiseworthy examples thus arranged there follows a shorter section of blameworthy examples presented in order that the reader might 30 Ibid., p. 2. 31 Ibid., p. 3. 32 Muhammad Mandfir notes Ibn al-Mu'tazz' lack of consistent criteria in selecting these particular five devices, remarking that he joins three unrelated categories: 1) metaphor, which is the very essence of poetry, 2) means of expression (iuruq add'), which depend on form and are not absolutely essential to poetry-tajnis, tibdq and radd al-ajuz (ala al-sadr, and 3) a mental process-al- madhhab al-kalima (Muhammad Mandur, al-Naqd al-Manhaji linda alt-Arab, [Cairo: Dar Nahdat Mir li-al-Tabc wa-al-Nashr, n.d.] p. 52). The point that I am trying to make is that in the hands of the badifc poet categories one and two become sub- sumed under category three, which alone is the distinguishing feature of badi' poetry. 33 Ibn al-Muctazz, Kiteb al-Badic, p. 58. According to Bonebakker this part of the text, on the mnahisin al-shi'r, was written later than the five chapters on badi'f proper and was appended to the text (S. A. Bonebakker, "Reflections on the Kita-b al-Badic," pp. 193-4). In any case this section is an appendix of some sort rather than an integral part of the text.</page><page sequence="17">TOWARD A REDEFINITION OF "BADI"' POETRY 17 avoid similar poetic pitfalls.34 Examples in the latter category, as we might have expected, are solely from the poetry and the prose of the Ancients and Moderns, to the exclusion of any of the religious sources. As for Abiu Tammam, his poetry is heavily represented throughout the book, with a large preponderance of good examples from his work over bad.35 This is consistent with the author's remark in the introduction that Abu Tammam's fault was im- moderation in and infatuation with badfc, rather than bad verses in the badic style. As we would expect from Ibn al-Muctazz' introduction, in the chapter on istiCdrah (metaphor) he recognizes no historical development in the figure itself and hence, since he limits his treatment to the figures alone, no development in poetry at all. Ibn al-Muctazz either did not notice or did not consider significant the qualitative change in metaphor from the Ancients to the Moderns. It is enough for him that they all fit his definition "the borrowing of a word for something not known by it from something known by it." 36 However, a comparison between the Ancient and Modern examples that Ibn al-Muctazz presents reveals fundamental dif- ferences between the metaphor of the Ancients and that of the Moderns.

'8 First of all, the 'Abbasid poet has inverted the common motif of time or fate as the agent of destruction and death and has made it instead their victim. Furthermore, the concept of the perishing of time or the destruction of death reflects a level of abstract thinking unknown to the Ancients, but rather, derived from the disputations of the Mutakallimuin on whether time is finite or infinite. Thus what these two lines by Aba Tammam are really dealing with is the at- tribution of one abstraction to another-finiteness to time. This clearly reflects a more sophisticated degree of abstract thinking than Imru' al-Qays' metaphor of the slow passage of the night as the cumbersome rising of a camel or Labid's metaphor of the swiftness and violence of the north wind as that of an impetuous rider: t ; T 0. c 8 0 -O - I JO}- 1* Js.i~J | 3U.$ : ,I .

In his introduction, he dismissed Abfu Tammam's abundant use of rhetorical devices as mere infatuation. But the inadequacies of Ibn al-Mu'tazz' theory and method are already beginning to show. By claiming that the difference between the poetry of the Ancients and badic poetry is in the number of devices per qastdah, and then proceeding to deal only with excerpted lines and, furthermore, as was evident in his chapter on isti'cdrah, refusing to recognize any qualitative difference in the devices themselves, it is a foregone conclusion that he will find no difference between these two. Ibn al-Mu'tazz does distinguish be- tween two types of tajnis: one based on ishtiqaq (etymology) in which the two members of the tajnts derive from the same root and have some shared meaning, and the other based on homonymity, in which the two members share the same spelling but are etymo- logically unrelated: Tajnfs is the occurrence of one word that resembles another in a verse of poetry and in speech. This similarity consists of one word resem- bling the other in composition and letters in the way according to which al-'Asmaci composed the Kitdb al-Ajnds. And Khalil said that every sort of people and birds, prosody and grammar belongs to a genus. This then is the reason that one word resembles another in the composition of its letters and in its meaning. And from this there is derived a saying like the poet's: ,J' - - a-- 50 "A day on which you dragged their souls on a rope." 39 Ibid., pp. 7, 1 1. 'I 'Abd al-Qahir al-Jurjani, Asrdr al-Baldghah, ed.

Or one word can resemble the other in the composition of letters but not in meaning, such as the poet's saying: "Indeed the blame of the lover is avarice." [Lawm (blame) is from the root l-w-m while lum is the lightened form of lu'm (avarice, meanness) from the root l-'-mJ.4' In the chapter on tajnis it becomes even clearer that Ibn al- Muctazz' quantitative explanation of badic is inadequate. He fails to realize that, as in the case of metaphor, there is in tajnts a logical/historical progression. At one extreme there are the idiomatic constructions of the Arabic language such as the mafzil mu.tlaq or expressions such as qala qd'ilun (it is said) which, although they might technically fit the definition of tajnis, could hardly be considered conscious rhetorical devices. Next would be the takrdr li- al-ta 'kid (repetition for the sake of emphasis) which adds at least an emotive significance. After this comes the tajnzs proper, the more or less unconscious association of similar-sounding words or names tending more toward alliteration than pun. Finally, there is the conscious or self-conscious punning which is based on a highly developed awareness of ishtiqdq (etymology) as well as of the subliminal semantic connection between homonyms and etymons. An examination of several instances of tajnis by Abtu Tammam, taken from Ibn al-Mu'tazz' examples will make it clear that they are of a different nature from the type of tajnis that prevailed in the poetry and prose of the Ancients: -,k 1j L!- -G I 6 4 o On the day of Arshaq when the battle had flung A heavy sweeping salvo of death. .

It appears that he did not pass by a place-name that he needed to mention or that occurred in a story that he mentioned in his poetry without deriving a tajnis from it or creating a figure of badic. Thus he was at fault and violated a definitive precept.43 What both Ibn al-MuCtazz and al-Jurjani fail to realize is the change in the consciousness from the Jahili to the cAbbasid poet. What al-Jurjani attributes to takalluf (constraint, artificiality) is really the product of the development of the linguistic sciences (Culujm al-lughah), among them ishtiqaq. No cultivated courtier of the third century hijra, much less a poet, could be ignorant of these developments. Thus Abtu Tammam's tajnis&amp;t on proper names are not mere alliteration, but rather a sort of suggested etymology for the place names such a third century man of letters would have been familiar with from the works of the Basran and Kufan philologists-although the poet's goal is literary rather than linguistic. Another example of tajnts by Abfi Tammam displays a sophisticated interplay of literal and figurative meaning: 0 - ., , - From the bearing of obligations and of swordbelts [His shoulder] is worn, like the well-worn paths to ancient wells." Here the poet describes two kinds of burden (4iml) that the shoulder bears, the first one figurative: hamdldt (obligations, bloodwits) and the second literal: hama'il (swordbelts). Examples from the Ancients, on the other hand, reflect in- dividual instances of alliteration or punning rather than a consistent mental habit of abstract and etymological thinking. Hence the Qur'anic example: 42 Ibid., p. 29. 43 al-Jurjani, Asrdr al-Baldghah, p. 15. 44 Ibn al-Mu'tazz, Kitdb al-Badic, p. 29.</page><page sequence="22">22 TOWARD A REDEFINITION OF "BADI'' POETRY - - I - . oj o "And I surrendered myself with Sulayman to God the Lord of the Worlds, 9 45 Similarly, among Ibn al-Mu'tazz' examples from the Ancients is the verse by the early Islamic poet Ziyad al-Acjam: . - 5 a)0 0J - . a 0-08 JJ0O- I was told of their seeking assistance from [BanJul Kahil, And they are withers and a hump for blame.41 which involves only a play on the proper name Kahil and kahil (withers, shoulder), and is devoid of the manipulation of abstrac- tions and ambiguities that is characteristic of the Moderns.

What was the product of occasional fancy or insight in the J&amp;hillyah period has become in the cAbbasid the reflection of highly systematized and analytical sciences of philology and etymology. The connection of these abstract and analytical thought processes that are characteristic of badi-c poetry with those of the Muctazilah and the Mutakallimu-n will be further strengthened if we note that the same Basran milieu that produced them also produced the famous 45 Ibid., p. 25. 46 Ibid., p. 26. 47 As al-AsmaCl notes in his commentary on this line, there is no internal evidence to indicate that al-Tammn&amp;h is a proper name.

Among its luminaries were the great anthologists and philologists Abu 'CAmr ibn al-'Ala' (d. 154 H.) and his disciple al-AsmalI (d. 213 H.); Khalil ibn Ahmad, another student of Abu 'CAmr, who compiled the first Arabic dictionary, the Kitab al-cAyn, and was the first to systematize the Arabic poetic meters, and his student Slbawayh (d. 176 H.) whose Kitab remains until today the most authoritative Arabic grammar. 49 It is no wonder then that the literary heirs to such a tradition of analysis and systematization should display a certain loss of in- nocence when dealing with language. That is to say that the large number of tajnisat or other rhetorical devices in badif poetry is not a mere proliferation due to infatuation, as Ibn al-Mu'tazz and 'Abd al-Qahir al-Jurjani would have it, but rather the product of a con- stant and conscious awareness of the logical and etymological rela- tionships between words. Ibn al-Mu'tazz' treatment of mu.tabaqah (antithesis) suffers from the same defects as his treatment of isticarah and tajnis. Again there is evidence, unnoticed or unremarked by Ibn al-Muctazz, of a logical and chronological development in the form of this device. Included among the examples from the Ancients are such simple antitheses as al-Farazdaq's - . d O, O .0 , I - - May God make Bantu Kulayb ugly, for they neither betray their neighbor, nor fulfill their promise to him.50 There are also compound ones such as the Umayyad poet 'Abd Allah ibn al-Zabir al-'Asadi's antithesis describing women ravaged by war: - -S l , i -, ,, J-J, Then it turned their black hair white And their white faces black.51 49 Ignace Goldziher, A Short History of Classical Arabic Literature, trans.

Whichever one is stated, the other is implied.</page><page sequence="25">TOWARD A REDEFINITION OF " BADI" ' POETRY 25 his beloved and her tribe inhabited it and its present state of desola- tion and ruin. Moreover, the poet is drawing a parallel between the traditional poetic motif of the abandoned campsite and the historical/political changes that the Arab nation had undergone: the once pure Arab tribal life and language of the Jahillyah age has given way to bastardization and barbarism, to racial and cultural Shu'u-bijyah. The progression of these examples makes it evident that there occurred in Arabic poetry a development from simple an- tithesis to lines involving compound, abstract and metaphorically- derived antitheses. A second problem that manifests itself in the examination of this rhetorical figure is that since Ibn al-Mu'tazz has isolated the verses from their poetic context, there is no consideration of the relation- ship of a particular antithesis to the qasidah of which it is part. Is it a mere embellishment or an expression of some aspect of the semantic structure of the poem? Structuralist studies of pre-Islamic poetry, notably Kamal Abu Deeb's analysis of the Mu'allaqah of Labid, argue convincingly that the dynamic of the qayidah may be based on an open-ended series of dialectical oppositions: life/death, barren- ness/fertility, etc.54 Whatever the case for pre-Islamic poetry, it is clear that a number of Abui Tammam's qaszdahs are consciously constructed with such dialectical oppositions as major themes, so that the mudtabaqdt that occur in the imagery of particular lines are semantic elements that reiterate and reinforce the leitmotif of the poem and reflect the various aspects of the central image. A striking example of this is 'Abtu Tammam's cAmm-urlyah Qaslidah55 in which the underlying thematic antithesis-Islam/Kufr is reinforced by lesser supporting antitheses-the Caliph al-MuCtasim/the Byzantine Emperor Theophilus, light/darkness, male/female, etc. This consciously constructed antithetical structure is not only sug- gestive of the dialectical form of theological disputation (kaldm), but also reflects the subtle penetration of Manichaean dualism into 'Abbasid thought. Ironically, Abiu Tammam exploits this Infidel idea in poetic form to buttress his defense of the Islamic Caliphate. Ibn al-Mu'tazz' fourth category of badi', radd cajuz al-kaldm 'ala sadrihi (repetition at the end of a speech of its beginning) does not 54 Kamal Abu Deeb, "Towards a Structural Analysis of pre-Islamic Poetry," IJMES, 6 (1975), pp. 148-184. 55 Dfwdn Abi Tammdm, Vol. 1, pp. 40-74.</page><page sequence="26">26 TOWARD A REDEFINIT'ION OF "BADI' POETRY logically qualify to be included as one of the five major bases of badi" since it lacks the semantic value of the other devices.

He fails to distinguish between such examples as the Qur'anic one: s i- a - - - - bg .

Similarly, the lines that Ibn al-MuCtazz cites from the Moderns usually exhibit as their outstanding rhetorical feature tajnis, to which the radd al- cajuz cala al-sadr merely adds emphasis, or else a simple repetition for emphasis or for achieving a certain alliterative balance in the line: . -.. ;- fi--,, 5 5 He quests and is requested when he goes forth in the morning, And the better of your two friends is the requested quester.

This is his category of al-madhhab al-kaldmf. There are several indications that Ibn al-Mu'tazz had difficulty with this term. First of all, he does not attempt to define it, but instead attributes it to al-Jahiz, without, however, giving any specific reference. Secondly, al-madhhab al- kalami does not fit Ibn al-Mu'tazz' major thesis that all the elements of badi"f are to be found among the Ancients, in the Qur'an and the Hadith. He declares instead that, "As for this category, I do not know that I have found anything of it in the Qur'an. It is attributed to affectation (takalluj) and God is exalted above that by far! "59 Nor does he offer any examples from the Hadith. Indeed, he gives only three examples in the Ancient category: two of these are anecdotes, such as the following: cUmar said to cAbd Allah ibn cAbbas, "Whom do you think we should appoint as governor of Hims?" He replied, "A man who is truthful about you and truthful to you." cUmar said, "You be that man." He replied, "There is no use in [appointing] me with my bad opinion of your bad opinion of me."60 The sole poetic example in the Ancient category is from the Umayyad poet al-Farazdaq: 'J1 J_ - ' s- -sO- '' 0) V. _ 5 , _ _ , Every man has two souls: a noble soul, And another that the gallant youth disobeys and obeys. * I -05 - '' j'b - 'O- ' And your soul of your two souls intercedes for generosity When [its] intercessors among free [souls] are rare.6' The paucity of Ancient examples, especially considering that there are no examples at all from the Qur'an, the Hadith and pre-Islamic poetry, flatly contradicts Ibn al-Mu'tazz' opening assertion about badr. Al-madhhab al-kaldmf was in fact historically a new phenome-- non.

Most of the Muctazilites said ... that God is knowing, powerful and living through Himself, not by knowledge, power and life. And they declared absolutely that God has knowledge in the sense that He is knowing; and power, in the sense that He is powerful, but they did not apply this to life saying He has life. Abfi Hudhayl said: He is knowing by a knowledge that is He and He is powerful through a power that is He, and He is living by a life that is He.63 O J, JI3 0C - 3 - - - I X 1. *UL!w1a_K.fDy sJ9 1 -,-!k That man thinks-and what the fool thinks does not count- That I consider him a man. 2. u J l "?JSl u; ; 3sl That is what he thinks, but to me he is like some one who Never existed, even if he had existed. (Abfi Nuwas) 62 Manduir, al-Naqd al-Manhajf, p. 52. It is worth noting that later critics for the most part ignored this chapter of the Kitdb al-Badit, while the rest of the book was the first major source for virtually all later rhetorical criticism. According to von Grunebaum, only two major works deal with al-madhhab al-kaldmi, Abfi Hilal al-'Askari's Kitdb al-.Sindcatayn and al-Khwarizmi's Mafdtfh al-1Ulm. In the latter, it is considered among the devices found in prose (Gustave E. von Grunebaum, A Tenth-Century Document of Arabic Literary Theory and Criticism. The sections on poetry of al-Bdqilldnf's I'jaz al-Qur'dn [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1950] pp. 115-118). As for al-CAskari, he has apparently included al-madhhab al-kaldmi for the sake of completeness, but his merely giving an abbreviated version of Ibn al-Muctazz' chapter without any additional examples or comments indicates that it had little meaning or importance for him. See, Abu Hilal al-cAskarli, Kitdb al-Sindcatayn, ed. cAll Muhammad al-Bajawi &amp; Muhammad Abui al-Fadl Ibrahim (2nd ed., n. pl.: cIsa al-B&amp;bi al-Halabi wa-Shurakahu, 1971) pp. 426-427. 63 al-Ashcari, Maqaldt al-Isldmtytn, pp. 164-165.</page><page sequence="29">TOWARD A REDEFINITION OF "BADI"' POETRY 29 8. .1 a o J - *JO .)

Ibn al-Mu'tazz has attempted to reduce the effect of kaldm-speculative theology in particular, but in more general terms the spirit of logical disputation and rational investigation that affected every aspect of the arts and sciences in the "Mu'tazilite Era"-to a mechanically reproducible embellishment. But, as we have seen in the analyses of the other rhetorical figures, the new trend in poety was not limited to this rhetorical device, nor, indeed, to the realm of rhetoric. Ibn al-Muctazz failed to see that al-madhhab al-kalm- was not a rhetorical device at all, nor was badi' poetry the result of a mere proliferation of the rhetorical devices of the Ancients. Rather, al-madhhab al-kaldmi is precisely that mode of thought, abstract, dialectical, metaphorical, that, as the analyses of the rhetorical figures demonstrate, distinguishes CAbbasid courtly culture from J-hiliyah tribal society and which, in the realm of literature, created the new badi' style distinct from the poetry of the Ancients.
