<plain_text><page sequence="1">CROSS CULTURAL EDUCATIONAL ADAPTATION IN CEYLON T. L. Green INTRODUCTION Cross cultural education needs to be considered within two frames of reference, theoretical and practical; or, from the standpoints of the educational sociologist and the practising teacher. Education, as part of a social, cultural and historical continuum, has both conserv- ative and progressive functions, preserving the values of the past and modelling those of the future, within its own setting. It has, however, been treated as a rootless, readily transferable technique, as though, without a determining past, it could be applied to any future. To overcome this, in the future, those who practice education should be acquainted with the theoretical questions involved, so that education may be "social philosophy in action." In a brief review, neither theory nor practice can adequately be described, nor can any universal course of procedure be laid down. Instead the attempt will be made, using Ceylon as an example, to illustrate problems likely to arise, to suggest methods of meeting them and to indicate other sources of information, to help both the theoretical student of cultural change and those who are practically involved in bringing it about. It has been said by Melbyl that ". . . we must understand that it is the total community that educates, that it is the child's total envi- ronment which makes impact upon him and shapes him ... the com- munity itself and its individual citizens are likewise being shaped by the community life and process." Thus the first need is to understand the society within which one works, how it preserves and transmits existing values and what are the barriers to the acceptance of new values. Only then is it possible to apply new educational procedures-for no one can understand the present who lacks knowledge of the past, and those who do not understand the present should not plan the future. DETERMINANTS OF VALUE SYSTEMS IN CEYLON Historical, social, cultural and economic factors operate to pro- duce sub-cultures in which ethnic, linguistic and religious differen- tials appear. The Ceylonese number over 6j millions at the most recent census comprised of Sinhalese (79%o), Tamils (20%o), Burghers (0.6%o), together with small permanent minorities of Ceylon Moors, Malays, etc. and smaller temporary minorities (e.g. Europeans). The original inhabitants today are represented by the illiterate 292</page><page sequence="2">CROSS-CULTURAL EDUCATIONAL ADAPTATION IN CEYLON 293 backward forest-dwelling Veddah people. The Sinhalese came from India over two thousand years ago and were followed by waves of immigrant Tamils, who today comprise the S. Indian labour forces, The two languages are different, with different scripts, Sinhalese being derived from Sanscrit and Tamil being of Dravidian origin. The Sinhalese are Buddhists, the Tamils are Hindu, but both today include a small number of Christians. The Burghers descend from Portuguese and Dutch inter-marriage with Sinhalese (and on a small scale, with Tamils); a few claim still to be pure Dutch and both groups have adopted English as a badge of their partially Euro- pean origin. At one time a power group, the Dutch Burghers have now lost status and many have emigrated.3 The Moors and Malays are Muslims. The Moors, of Arab origin, form an important trading and mercantile group, though they are educationally backward. The economy is mostly agricultural, but there is a growing need for technological development to raise the standard of living-the average wage has been given as 570 rupees per year.' Productive work absorbs most of the gainfully employed but the Sinhalese ambi- tion is to be "a gentleman," living off the land; or to seek service with the government, the largest employer, at clerical level or above, thus gaining status security and economic reward. Caste, long a factor in social equilibrium, 5 is still operative, though now less inhibitory of social mobility. 6 Sinhalese society has been described as "loosely integrated," 1 a condition considered as a social determinant of insecurity of personality.8 Buddhism involves well known value systems such as Kharma, Dhamma, ahimsa, re-birth and the like, which become of particular significance for education. Astrological belief is well nigh universal and there are widespread beliefs of magical and anthropomorphic origin. Western education, originating with the missionaries and aimed first at proselytism was developed by the British to provide a clerical corps and as a political interest to foster a class "attached to their country by birth, and to England by education." 9 Ruler identification made this a social instrument which led to a large English educated middle class and an upper class elite whose wealth and status set a pattern which for long rejected, and even despised its indigenous culture. Political independence has led to a resurgent nationalism which embodies tensions relating to language and religion and is both a battle of cultures and a clash between the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority.</page><page sequence="3">294 THE JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL SOCIOLOGY THE TRANSMISSION OF VALUES While society and experience as a whole are agents in the trans- mission of values it will be appropriate to confine attention to child- rearing practices, the formal procedures of the educative process and to some consideration of their outcome-to the psychology of child- hood in Ceylon. Child-rearing practices in a low country village have been studied by Straus, 8 some comments on the situation in general have been made by Green 10 who has also reported on the attitudes of adults to child behavior in Ceylon. 11 Family structure, within which child-rearing takes place, is pos- sessed of special characteristics which undoubtedly vary within the sub-cultures of Ceylon. While there are remnants of matrilineal or- ganization and of the joint-family system, today, family organization is patriarchal and women are subservient to men, though in functional terms the family is a conceptual unit extending far beyond parents and their children. These extended loyalties are limiting factors on individual freedom and impose a number of restrictions which oper- ate as sanctions in numerous situations. In general, children are expected to be submissive to authority, to conform to parental demands and social mores and to be depend- ent. They are taught to worship their parents and the priest. The baby and young child are indulged in a permissive situation which makes no exacting demands in regard to feeding or excretory habits. At the birth of a subsequent child, or on reaching walking age, the interest and attention of the father seems suddenly to be withdrawn, a traumatic experience which may be heightened by sudden and forceful weaning. Over-protection exists throughout childhood, for children are constantly attended by parent, ayah (nursemaid) or ser- vant. They are seldom alone and seldom out of sight of familiar sit- uations and people, and often in physical contact with the latter. Children are typically "rocked to sleep," often lying on the floor with the head upon the leg of mother, ayah or older sister. The value systems and attitudes of society are impressed by social imitation, direct teaching, through songs, rhymes and admonitory verses, by "rites de passage," by punishment, usually physical, often severe and seldom consistent, and by threats to security. Among the latter may be mentioned threats of abandonment, of giving away (among the poor, children are often given away, ostensibly as a form of adoption, in fact to become child servants) or of being taken away by the "goonabilla" ("bogey man"). The Sinhalese in general, more particularly the villagers, whose</page><page sequence="4">CROSS-CULTURAL EDUCATIONAL ADAPTATION IN CEYLON 295 religious beliefs are mostly anthropomorphic and magical, are strongly influenced by astrology. Each individual has a horoscope cast from which suspicious times are determined for all major life events. Thus it is on an "auspicious day" that the child, usually in the third, fifth or seventh year "learns his first letters," repeating them after priest or teacher. Long before it is possible to estimate ability, a child may have been astrologically defined as lacking ability -and be educationally neglected. Others may prove to lack ability, as measured by performance later in school days, and suffer because there exists no astrological grounds for such deviant behaviour. Children run naked up to three, four, five, and later in the vil- lages, but are slowly brought to accept the attitudes of society, largely derived from Buddhism, which are as much those of shame as of modesty. Girls have restricted freedom, especially after the first men- struation, with which are associated particular rites-de-passage. No girl or young woman travels alone after dark, or even in daylight, except in very familiar situations. Heterosexual contacts are limited to home and school and the relations between the sexes closely guarded. Though these conditions are most typical of rural society and the lower socio-economic urban groups, they extend far up the social scale and none are entirely absent, even among the westernized upper classes. Indeed, at this level, over-protection and consequent depend- ence may be even more marked. It may be pointed out here that in Tamil society family structure is even more instituitionalized and child rearing practices less per- missive. Among the Islamic groups, where "purdah" exists in vary- ing degrees of orthodoxy, child-rearing my be still more exacting. In contrast is the greater degree of freedom accorded to Burgher chil- dren, of both sexes, consequent upon their preservation of certain western values and Christian belief. The social climate of education is authoritarian 10 in conformity with general social attitudes and the "guru" tradition-for the priest was once the teacher. 12 Verbalisation and memorization, the means of communication and transmission among illiterate people, have re- tained their position and added to the authority of the printed word which has to be remembered, rather than understood. Teaching is formal, authoritarian and abstract with too little attention to experi- ence or experimentation. There is little group work, little evidence of progressive attitudes and an emphasis upon note taking. While curriculum chance has been a main consideration among educational officials and their advisers for a long time, it still reflects</page><page sequence="5">296 THE JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL SOCIOLOGY formalistic rather than progressive views in education. The emphasis is on informational content and not on experiential socializing facets, nor even on social needs,"" though the worst anomalies of the former political overlordship are being removed. An important aspect of the formal educative position is the high proportion of untrained teachers and the low proportion of graduate teachers. Under-qualified and untrained teachers provide a factor which operates in conservative terms and reflects the least progres- sive values in society. It should, however, be pointed out that education has been and is responsible for much of value in Ceylon 1' and that since political independence much progress has been made. 15 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CHILDHOOD The dangers of accepting as real what are only apparent differ- ences of psychological make-up need no stressing, for they have been demonstrated by Anastasi and Foley 16 and many others. At the same time the work of Mead, 17 Benedict 18 and duBois 19 to name but a few, demonstrates the reality of cultural differentiation in person- ality. More recently, Priestley 20 using an Asian setting, has pointed out the dangers of transferring motivational and other interpretations from one culture pattern to another. Children in Ceylon, seen against western standards, appear sub- missive-yet liable to aggression when control is removed; this exists right up to undergraduate days. Inter-personal and inter-group ten- sions are very marked and child society is based on ever changing cliques. Though interests and hobbies exist, the opportunities to meet and extend them are few; as a result children lack the "know- how" initiative and resourcefulness characteristic of the western child. Persistence levels appear to be low, and interest does not lead to occupational ambition, which instead is motivated by status-seeking factors. 21 Dexterity and manual skill, as may be expected in a non- mechanized culture, appears to be high in childhood, 22 but mechan- ical and scientific interests fail to develop. Youth performs at high level in tasks based on verbal factors but at surprisingly low levels where non-language factors are involved. 22. 23 Insecurity appears as a marked feature of childhood, 8 coupled with hyper-sensitivity to criticism and lack of confidence. There is little independence and little sense of adventure. However, to a con- siderable degree, both resistance and resiliance, appear to be the basis of successfully dealing with a situation full of conflicting factors. Thus children appear to be able to learn western science and at the same time accept direction by non-causative theory-without devel-</page><page sequence="6">CROSS-CULTURAL EDUCATIONAL ADAPTATION IN CEYLON 297 oping conflicts. It seems possible that anxiety neurosis is a not un- common feature of children in a culture pattern demanding conform- ity to agencies which are inconsistent and often in conflict. It may be that anxiety regarding sex is also marked, for, while the old social taboos remain the traditional models of sex education (e.g. menstrual rites-de-passage) are disappearing, youth is subjected, on an ever- increasing scale, to the stimuli of western press, film and radio. This problem of conflict, despite the apparent capacity to adapt to it or ignore it, is of importance as a determinant of personality. Between the demands of home and schools, age and youth and the traditional and progressive factors in living, there are sharp differences. Their effect on the individual has yet to be explored, but that they must add to insecurity seems certain. The most marked feature is the lack of a developmental attitude towards childhood and youth in Ceylon. The child is treated as though there were almost immediate changes from babyhood to childhood, and from childhood to adulthood. This attitude, which thrusts re- sponsibility on the child too soon is accompanied by a long continued demand for dependence. There is no concept of maturation, no inter- pretation of adolescence as a period in which the individual slowly achieves independence and heterosexual adjustment. At the first menstruation the girl is said to have "attained age" and the question of marriage at once arises. It may be long deferred, but the most recent census 2 recorded over forty-four thousand births (in a total of one and a fifth millions) to girls of fourteen and below. THE BARRIERS TO ACCULTURATION The situation so briefly described above, which may well be less complex than those obtained elsewhere in Asia is, nevertheless, com- plex enough to present difficulties to those wishing to adapt educa- tional means to a new society, as agents of acculturation. Though it cannot be explored more fully here, it is clear that many of the ideas expressed at the Stanford Conference on Education and Anthropol- ogy 25 might well be applied to this problem, especially Siegel's con- cept of models. This would show how value systems inherent in a number of social institutions in Ceylon lead to attitudes and patterns of action which are used as modes of cultural transmission. It would demonstrate also the genesis of inter-cultural conflicts, dependent upon value dif- ferences and emerging as tensions. Associated with these cultural phenomena would be others, in which economic and historical aspects are important, which act as limitations and directives of the institu- tional aspect of education. Lastly would be the question of individual</page><page sequence="7">298 THE JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL SOCIOLOGY personality, shaped by society, possessed of certain psychological characteristics, reacting as a peer culture and simultaneously acting as a determinant of the future society. From such an extended analysis there would emerge many points among which four are of importance. a. The basic values, such as those deriving from Buddhist belief, cannot be questioned in a world searching for toleration. b. Many of the patterns of behavior demanded of the individual are not the outcomes of the basic value system but, as in western societies, are secondarily contingent upon the inadequacies of adult psychology, the demands of expediency and a misunderstanding of the nature of childhood. c. The key points in the position are in relation to personality and attitudes, so that the fundamental problems will have to be tackled in terms of socialization, and not of informational transmission. d. The key points of Sinhalese personality patterns have been the subject of comment from early travellers to writers of the present day. Despite this we still lack detailed work in this field, though Cey- lon would be an ideal ground for testing hypotheses relating to cul- tural personality determinants. The insecurity, already noted is asso- ciated with a syndrome of such features as over-sensitiveness to criti- cism, unwillingness to accept responsibility 26 and lack of faith in personal abilities. Jealousy is common, leading to readiness to jetti- son group ends for personal reasons, and tensions related to com- munal loyalties are strongly marked.27' 28 Short-term ends are more readily sought than those based on distant planning and there is little idea of cooperation based on mutual responsibility and involvement. The low levels of aspiration in terms of effort and standard of per- formance and the lack of any idea of maximum output in "an honest day's work" So constantly confront those seeking to regear the social machine. e. The conditions to be faced have developed over a long period of time and on a wide front and no programme which is set in any but long-time wide-scale terms is likely to be successful. EDUCATIONAL ADAPTATION The complexity of the problem needs no further emphasis, except perhaps to add that those who work within the University have no direct means of influencing education. (Indirectly they may do so through teacher training). Faced with a wide and complex field and a restricted sphere of action the writer attempted to lay down certain guiding principles. These include:- a. Extending the activities of the Department of Education into as</page><page sequence="8">CROSS-CULTURAL EDUCATIONAL ADAPTATION IN CEYLON 299 many extra-mural fields as possible, in order to build up a wider understanding of educational issues throughout society. In English and the vernacular langages, through the local press, Radio Ceylon1 and through Parent Teacher Associations and the like there has been carried on a constant conditioning of the public to the wider issues of education presented in progressive terms. b. Working in co-operation with official and non-official profes- sional bodies provides an approach to the specialist. The Department of Education of the University of Ceylon has thus been associated with advisory committees, the Advisory Council on Education of Ceylon, the Police and Probation Department, the Ministries of Education, Health and Home Affairs and Associations of Teachers, Inspectors, the Training Colleges, etc. in a wide variety of educational work. c. Developing research in educational and in related social spheres. A research programme was laid down at the inception of the Depart- ment with objectives related to Ceylon's educational needs and prob- lems and the interests of the staff. Without a clearly formulated plan, research work may lack integration and be irrelevant to local problems. d. Training local staff who will be responsible for teacher training, not along formal lines, but by developing a democratic relationship, working as a group dealing with a joint responsibility, encouraging research and facilitating overseas study and travel and receiving as many visitors from overseas as possible. Teacher training is the main key available to those engaged in educational adaptation, and the first aim should be to make it teacher- education, a widening of experience, a re-orientation of interests and a re-shaping of attitudes, rather than a merely informational course. So far as content is concerned, little may be said, beyond empha- sising the need to deal with social concepts, social psychology, educa- tional sociology and the social interpretation of historical and com- parative studies in education. It is method that is most important. The main problem, already described and defined, is that of helping towards the growth of secur- ity, confidence, responsibility, co-operation and the like. These can be the subjects of reading and of lectures, but to become part of a personality, they have to be experienced. Thus, while lectures are unavoidable, they should be as little authoritarian as possible. Stu- dents should have opportunity to question the speaker, even to plan the syllabus. There should be seminars, tutorial groups (assigned to tutors available often to give help and advice) group work on pro- jects, surveys and pilot research studies. The constant aim must be</page><page sequence="9">300 THE JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL SOCIOLOGY to build up, between all concerned, a sympathetic rapport and a feel- ing of being collaborators with a joint responsibility: the betterment of society through education. Authority must exist, but it should be the authority deriving from a social situation, and not dictated in virtue of status or person. Responsibility must be widespread-by participant activities in which each individual has a contribution to make. Confidence must be gained-not by precept, but by readiness on the part of the tutor to do all that he asks of others, especially in the field of practical work. Some of the more pressing and dangerous problems can be taken for special and practical attention. Stereotypes of one sub-cultural group as seen by another can be studied by the groups whose mem- bers act as subjects. The reactions of individuals to aggression, inhi- bition, sarcasm and other so-called disciplinary devices can be stud- ied by using real examples in the group and the staff. Psychodrama at an elementary and non-specialist level can be used for experimental purposes. Hierarchic organization should, as much as possible, be ignored. In Ceylon, by happy chance as much as original planning, the students reading for the Diploma in Education have all had some teaching experience and have always included not only assist- ant teachers, but school principals and members of the inspectorate. The practical teacher will always ask "what do I do when I go back to my school?" He will go back to a barrier built of those who have not come into contact with his newly-acquired ideas and experi- ences, and he will not, in most cases, enjoy the support of status or collaborators. This is one of the situations which underlines the need for a widespread extra-mural campaign. Apart from that, our re- turned teacher must hope that his example will slowly carry the weight of conviction. To give him support, his Department should still feel some responsibility towards him, not through the often arid Old Students' Associations, but by a living contact of continued interest. He should be encouraged to visit, to write for help and he can be used as a collaborator in field work. He will have many problems to face. If he has been given some understanding of basic principles, rather than a training in "the tricks of the trade" he will have a universal procedure which can be adapted to the details of many specific situations. What are some of the typical situations ? A common one in Asia concerns practical work. Caste, low eco- nomic reward and restricted opportunity make metal work and wood work unpopular. Unfortunately they have been introduced as crafts, as thought of in the West. This stresses their vocational affinities</page><page sequence="10">CROSS-CULTURAL EDUCATIONAL ADAPTATION IN CEYLON 301 and masks cultural values. If they were introduced as subsidiaries to other subjects, such as the sciences, or as part of activity work in social studies first, they would be seen in a different setting, and prob- ably better accepted. Again, if the formal approach is deemed better, they can be linked up with caste-free vocations, and taught as relat- ing to engineering, electrical work etc. The mere change of name from "carpentry" to "wood work" had, in Ceylon, a pronounced effect upon the attitudes of parents and pupils. The most significant focal point lies in pupil-teacher relations, a field studied in relation to social climate elsewhere (e.g. Lippitt and White) 30 and in somewhat less formal terms in Ceylon (Green3 and Wyeth 32). Experience in the training department should have laid a foundation for improvements here. The teacher should have built on this by trying to understand his pupils and by seeking co- operation, rather than by using artificial competition and "discipline." He will need to understand their interests and motivations and use these in the service of education. It is particularly important to devise ways of "getting everyone in" and to avoid giving all the attention to the noisy extrovert, all the responsibility to the "leaders"-and all the neglect to the submissive recessives. If democrats come from democracy, then pupils must be given the chance to elect their officers, and helped to do so by discussions of the problems involved. The general thesis, so far as procedure is concerned, which is offered here, is that the teacher must interpret education as a social- izing experience and work in terms of social situation and relation- ships, rather than in academic and formal terms of "subjects." These cannot be neglected, but all the existing evidence points to the greater value of progressive as compared with formalistic procedures, even when measured by formalistic means. EVALUATION Sincerity and good intentions are no measure of success; it is thus essential to keep in mind the need for evaluation. At the first stage this may well be concerned with the more philosophical prob- lems involved-we have given too little attention to the basic ques- tion of whether what we want to introduce is of greater worth than what exists. In this connection the essays of Northrop, Basu, Little and Leach 34 offer valuable ideas. As a second stage a programme of evaluation should be instituted which may deal with the kind of topics reviewed by Green35 and which will involve some of the difficulties reviewed elsewhere by the same author.36 Evaluation, like other forms of soul searching, can be embarassing! It was, for example, shown by Jayasuriya 37 and Raja-</page><page sequence="11">302 THE JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL SOCIOLOGY ratnam, 38 in relation to science and arithmetic respectively, that the official legislation laid down in Ceylon, to regulate the teaching of these subjects in relation to language difficulties, was in direct opposi- tion to the ability of pupils to learn in the vernacular as opposed to English language. In connection with the same problems of language it has been shown 28 by sociometric means that a Ministerial attempt at repudiation of a school principal's diagnosis of communal cleavage was unsound. In particular, it may be noted that evaluation research can dis- close what the normal examination cannot. Thus, while the latter can give an estimate of what teachers have learned, in informational terms, about say, child psychology, only attitudinal evaluation can disclose shifts of attitude towards children. 3 Similarly it has been shown that the emphasis on science and practical subjects in schools in Ceylon has not yet resulted in the development of those abilities, basic to a developing technology, at which it aimed.40 The problem of curricular content needs rigorous attention and critical evaluation as a guide to fitting them to local needs. At present, in Ceylon and other under-developed Asian countries, a western tra- dition derived from a former political overload and the western train- ing of the key figures in education, coupled with a highly centralized educational system has led to the neglect of rural needs, in favour of those in urban areas. At the same time, social and economic pressures have emphasized academic subjects, rather than those of cultural or practical value. In brief, social needs, the developmental and cultural needs of the individual and particularly the interests of the pupil, have been overlooked. Thus, in Ceylon, science teaching has neglected the problems of the life situation of the pupil. Biological education has failed to capitalize on the value of biology as a central catalyst and the place of science in primary education-which is all that a majority receive-is neglected. CONCLUSION Many of the points raised above need far more detailed treatment than can be given them here. This, to some extent, accounts for the critical-and doubtless to some rather pessimistic-view given of education. It will be noted however that stress was laid on the prog- ress made in Ceylon and it cannot be of value to offer an analysis which suffers from the over optimism and other characteristics which the writer has elsewhere diagnosed as important limiting factors to progress in social action programmes. 36 Pink spectacles may be com- forting-but they are also relaxing to effort. The greatest need in education in the countries of South-east Asia, of which Ceylon is</page><page sequence="12">CROSS-CULTURAL EDUCATIONAL ADAPTATION IN CEYLON 303 typical, and among which she is in many ways a leader, is for that challenge to action which will only be derived from a critical study of education in its social setting. It has been the purpose of this re- view to give a blueprint of the form such a study should take. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Melby, E. O.: The Forward Look. Journ. of Educ. Sociology, Vol. 24.
