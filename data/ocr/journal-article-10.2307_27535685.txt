<plain_text><page sequence="1">by "Edwin Honig HISTORY, DOCUMENT, AND ARCHIBALD MacLEISH THE Waste Land of T. S. Eliot, more than any other single work, except possibly Ulysses, has been the 'inspiration' for most poetry of the younger generation written in America during the past fifteen years. The absolute idealization of cynic ism led to that bathetic mood upon which the sensibility of that generation thrived. Such a mood found, in the patterns of sensa tion and experience, the constant disparagement of human pas sion and deliberation which strove to make life good. The 'atomic' personality which came about as a result, mastered all the shifts and nuances of emotion so that it could never be caught red handed with a personal belief in the basic goodness of the passion of love or beauty, or even, of social justice. The two most ac complished inheritors of The Waste Land situation were Hart Crane and Archibald MacLeish. Crane, very early, and with a relatively high degree of consciousness and consistency, set about the task of outlawing from his poetry the implications of Eliot's philosophical pessimism, the common currency of his generation. To what extent The Bridge, his major work, became the complete artistic antithesis of The Waste Land, as he intended it should, is perhaps not readily certain. It did establish permanently, however, the first conscious attempt to make a break from the enervating influence of that sensibility. On the other hand, Mac Leish's development was slower, his disaffection less complete and for that reason, perhaps, his work has become symptom atic of the inconclusiveness of a new shift in sensibility. This new sensibility, of whose presence MacLeish is the most popular living evidence, has attempted to place the means of its salvation in a consciously social program, with more or less affinity for the current ideals of a socialist society. Though the imaginative re move from Eliot has never been finally resolved, a new poetic 7</page><page sequence="2">386 by EDWIN HONIG aesthetic has arisen which seeks its justification in all immediate evidence of social struggle in the body of contemporary experi ence. In emphasizing the exterior fate derived from a system of impersonal social stratification, it relies mainly upon the document of current history as opposed to any personally imaginative view toward experience which seeks, as modus vivendi, to recreate the past of history as it best confirms the matter of present per ception. The use of document exclusively in poetry yields the externalization of experience and the understatement of history as the vital record of man's past experience on earth. Poetic experience that has some object of criticism within it can only come from an imaginative view of past history integrated with the present. It would seem vain to establish as absolute the essential dichot omy between the concepts of document and history?just as it would seem vain for anybody to do the same between prose and poetry, between mysticism and religion, or between journalistic reporting and fiction. Essentially, an analysis or understanding of history?as Marx, for one, has shown?requires the immediate consciousness of, and even preoccupation with, the empiric events and documentary materials that find expression in contemporary experience. Only where a pre-eminence has been accorded to either one aspect of documentary experience or another as in MacLeish without an attempt to justify critically (in terms of the imagination) its historical implications, does the bearing of docu ment upon history become didactic and make for irresponsible division between the two. And inasmuch as the accent in the poetry of Archibald MacLeish and his type of sensibility seems to remain fixed upon certain fatal concerns, his ?work becomes reprehensible as an object that serves such an arbitrary dichot omy. The conclusions drawn from this situation are, therefore, those which seem most applicable to the attempt of temporarily isolating the dilemma in order to be better able to understand it. In his note to Conquistador, MacLeish has written, "Where I have followed the historical chronicles of the Conquest of Mexico I have, in general, followed the account given by Bernai Diaz del Castillo, one of the Conquerors, in his True History of the Conquest of New Spain. I have however altered and transposed and invented incidents at my own pleasure." The emphasis the</page><page sequence="3">HISTORY AND MacLEISH 387 poet wishes to show he has placed upon historic verisimilitude is not to be disparaged. But it is in the statement's second sentence that his actual viewpoint towards his materials, towards history, is betrayed. He has taken the history of the Mexican conquest not as imaginative idea but as story, as written document, and with the instrument of eclectic poetic sensibility has fashioned it into a romance, presumably inviting to the tastes of the modern reader. To do this he has had to alter, transpose, and invent situations which would not cause the whole to fall out of immediate familiarity as in following the actual history it would have to do. The deception is not in his having followed the document of his tory at all, but in his having had to supply it with an added docu ment of his own. He wishes to rewrite history as a scientist but asks to be excused for fanciful intrusions because he is a poet. In this way he obscures the poet with the scientist. For the poet who views history through the imagination views it not as the subject of past experience in itself, but as the object for identi fying a new experience whose inspiration is a present as real in predicament, yet whose proof and confirmation needs to be found in the past. MacLeish's sense of the past and present is unbalanced, for it is a sense of the past as a receptacle which will hold such emotions that in the present, without suitable subject-matter and predicament, might seem ludicrous. His heroes speak through his sensuous imagery and their movements exist in the tapestry-effect of the whole of their gifted rhetoric. It makes good 'romance', and it obviously attracts the serious reader because of its characteristic personal nostalgia which is so sym pathetically modern. His other alternatives are the anthropological myth, through Sir J. G. Frazer, and the subject matter of political and economic fatalities of the present, such as the depression, the rise of fascist dictators, and the encroaching war, and the implications rising out of these events, like the socialist ideology, and the cynic's retreat into a literary or religious culture. In the former, the evocation is still essentially personal as it relies upon the dichoto omy between the healthy simple biological ritual of the savage's life and the nostalagia in the civilized sensibility in whose life he finds no substitute for such ritual. (Such a perception, at its best, when devolved to a human personality, when used critically</page><page sequence="4">388 by EDWIN HONIG yields the curious biological fatalism in The Pot of Earth.) In the latter, although the emphasis is new, since it consciously seeks resolution in an exterior fate?the condition of mankind in the modern state?the effect is realized not in terms of its own present, but in the reversal of the r?le of past, 'romantic' history into future 'prophetic' history. This is best seen in MacLeish's verse plays since 1933. II In all his plays, the voice of destiny is the same voice suc cumbing to the vortex of death through sensation as in the char acter of Bernai Diaz in Conquistador; is at the same time the instrument of dramatic purpose and resolution, which is identi fied with some mechanical augurer. In Panic, it is a Tiresian old man; in the Fall of the City, it is a Lazurean old woman; in Air Raid, it is the windy radio-announcer. (In Fall of the City, in fact, the mythic city, the blazonry of people in the market-place, is almost an exact counterpart of MacLeish's scenic Tenochtitlan in Conquistador.) In no way does he give these crucial figures hu man justification. On the contrary, they are intended throughout to enact the poet's own sense of a doom that has no human justification: the fall of capitalist society in Panic, the coming of the dictator in Fall of the City, the bombardment in Air Raid. But the human injustice which is sufficient as attitude to wards the fact of these things, becomes distorted as it reveals the inadequacy with which he deals with the social groups affected, as individuals?each with some particularly human response to the conflict of that fact. (And this latter would, after all, seem the essence of all drama.) We seem to get little more from these plays in the end than the secret sense of esthetic joy which the poet has in fabricating blood-and-thunder situations in the sheerest reverberations of their melodrama. The contemporary situation which is used as premise in all the plays is real enough, but what the poet does with it in raising the magnitude of its original horror is to make it another thing. For we are made to feel that there is a point reached where statement about a fact, embellished with such artifices as an essentially 'literary' sensibility can create, becomes in effect the very antithesis of that fact. The dynamics of an ob</page><page sequence="5">HISTORY AND MacLEISH 389 ligation which compel MacLeish to be 'true to his time', and which compel him to create, are not penetrated by the sense of a personally conceived imaginative view to his materials,?a view which, in heightening the reality of that fact, would make it certain knowledge. The result is not simply that he is forced into ab straction, but that he is actually led to impose upon the reality of that fact a pseudo-reality, an unreality. In this there is the sense that like the camera which was once reputed never to be capable of lying, the character of documentary poetry, though proceeding from the existence of an actual situation, is neverthe less capable of producing confusion and distortion when the dyna mics which give it expression are incompletely imagined. The implications of belief construed from the documentary evi dence of contemporary struggle infilter his shorter and long poems in many ways. In Frescoes, for instance, there are sections in which the bitter-cynic aversion to any form of personal or social resolution arises. The cumulative effect of the whole, it may be supposed, is intended simply as representation of the contempor ary American scene in cross-section view?though it otherwise seems to be the only justification for a static personal perception. "The plump Mr. Pl'f is washing his hands of America. . ." is the satire of a man fleeing the cultural gregariousness of his native land to seek a haven in some more unified culture abroad. That Mac Leish, after all, has some sympathy for such an 'attitude of es cape' is evident in the forthright statement of another poem, American Letter,?if the sentiment in numerous of his earlier poems were not enough indication for the same emotion. He pokes lively fun at the Communists in Frescoes, as later in Public Speech he seems inclined to view them with a grain of more solemn forbearance. Then there is the wholly demonstrative attack upon science in Einstein as the abstract force denying the finity of human sensation in itself. And finally there is the strangely disjointed, yet moving, personal expression of The Hamlet of A. MacLeish, published in 1928. There are some lines in the Hamlet, more concentratedly per sonal than almost any other he was written?that are startling in their power to evoke the most extenuated emotion for the dilemma of the artist today.</page><page sequence="6">390 by EDWIN HONIG Why must I always Stoop from this decent silence to this phrase That makes a posture of my hurt?. . . . Make verses!. . . ease myself at the soiled stool That's common to so swollen many!. . . shout For hearing in the world's thick dirty ear!. . . Expose my scabs!. . . crowd forward among those That beg for fame, that for so little praise As pays a dog off will go stiff and tell Their loss, lust, sorrow, anguish. . . match My grief with theirs!. . . compel the public prize For deepest feeling and put on the bays!. . . O shame, for shame to suffer it, to make A skill of harm, a business of despair, And like a barking ape betray us all For itch of notice. . . . Yet when we read the dramatized agony in these lines, we are not struck so much by a resemblance to the predicament of Ham let's bleak moral self-impeachment (which after all had its re solution in a kind of action) or to the 'black night' of Job or St. John of the Cross (whose problem was with the divinity within themselves) but to Shakespeare's Coriolanus, who balked at the social responsibility of his own heroism. The modern counter part of the same problem presents the poet in the r?le of inverted hero and deluded saint: i.e. although his argument is that of the saint whose quarrel seems to be with himself alone, his secret identification is with the hero whose character he can no longer usurp. MacLeish's best personal poetry is seldom attained without an overburdening proportion of windy rhetoric, a striving to con sume all criticism. Yeats wrote, "We make out of the quarrel with others, rhetoric, but of the quarrel with ourselves, poetry." The crime of MacLeish's Hamlet is not that of not loving the world over-much particularly, but of being irresponsible in his self-love. The contamination is as complete as it is modern; for, as a result, he is driven to accept the overpowering sinful mother (where he sees his bewildered guilt reflected)?Nature, or the Earth. "It is time we should accept", is the bedraggled mask of Eliot's "Con sequently I rejoice, having to construct something upon which to rejoice." And it is in the wake of MacLeish's spiritual bank ruptcy, his 'acceptance', that he begins to 'construct' his fabul ously mythic 'literary' humanitarianism whose inflation is so</page><page sequence="7">HISTORY AND MacLEISH 391 breath-taking in the development of his verse plays, from Panic to Air Raid. Ill In his many observations on the subject of communication and poetry, MacLeish has continually seen the problem as the conflict between the artist living in the 'private' world and the artist living in the 'public' world. The terminology, though pos sibly originating in Auden's witty dedicatory piece to the Orators, ("Private faces in public places Are wiser and nicer than Public faces in private places.") is in valid consequence to the serious question which concerned MacLeish in the Hamlet, and which has likely concerned him for a long while. The dichotomy, still so tempting to twentieth century intellect, either depicts the tower artist like Stephen Daedalus with barren ashplant, or the re volutionary artist with political firebrand. The fault lies in the pathetic use of symbols. It is an exteriorization of the problem of belief with the first figure an acknowledgeable Hamlet several centuries old, and the second figure, an infant prodigal clamoring his new-born infant shrieks. Yet there is always some point at which the volume of his cries subsides and one is at a loss to recognize his patent callow personality. One wonders whether his identification finally lies in his namelessness, as with the men who die fighting in trenches, or in his fanatic self-surrender to the adventures of party politics. For his stance is unpredictable when his projected love for 'humanity' is vitalized only by his hate for 'self-analysis', when his imagination finds no bearings. The common, simple, earthriding ways of hand and feet and flesh against the enormous mysteries of sun and moon, of time, of disappearance-and-their-place - knowing - them - no more. The salt-sweating, robust, passionate, and at the last death-devoured lives of all men always. Man in the invisible sea of time that drowns him. Man in the sun, on the earth, under the branches?and, as he breathes, time sweeping him away. . . . Not myself, my soul, my glycerine-dropping eyes, but these unknown and nameless men, anonymous under this sky, small in these valleys and far-off and forever there. But contrary to the implications of MacLeish's statement, Na ture is not always so large that it consumes man. This we know because there is history which men have made through their parti</page><page sequence="8">392 by EDWIN HONIG cular struggles, just as the individual man or artist, as insepar able as his social destiny may be from "the lives of all men", must make his own history through the meanings and evolvements of personal struggle. Now the artist identifies himself with social revolution because it promises to constitute a creative transforma tion of human life in society. It promises to abolish existing civic society and create a socialized society where a broader basis will be afforded for the communication of his art. And a broader basis will be afforded because the concern of man will be with the human and ethical matters of his life on earth and not the mechani cal, political, and economic matters which a civic class society to day force on him. But art, as it always has been, will be the prob lem of individual men, because perception, interpretation, and or ganization through the use of the imagination, is always the prob lem of individual men. And so it becomes especially important now, when the values of art and life are so confused, when more is preached about them than is begotten from them, that the artist does not betray his one power of creativity,?the imagina tion, at the same time that he does not betray himself as a man of action?because essentially he can be both. For him, as not for most men, there is always held in the offing the power of revers ing his r?le at a particular moment, when it is justified in terms of his imagination. In this sense be transcends anthropomorphism in the face of a fateful Nature?which terrified his idolatrous Hamletian predecessors?and the irony of his r?le as man of ac tion transcends both 'private' and 'public' worlds since it be speaks, through action, the same imaginative criticism he has been used to express until that point, through poetry. The possibility of imaginative continuity between his art, as the product of in dividualized creativity, and social action, as the product of col lectivized creativity, exists for him for the first time in history. In this, however, there is some theoretical precedent. IV For in the lives of most poets in the past who made some in vestment in the imagination, there was evidence for a concern in one way or another with the phenomena of nature and history. William Blake wrote with regard to painting, "If you have not</page><page sequence="9">HISTORY AND MacLEISH 393 nature before you for every touch, you cannot paint portrait; and if you have nature before you at all, you cannot paint history." That he emphasized the difference between the fluxive sense-pro duct of nature and the intellectually organized imaginative product of history, does not become revealing until he adds, "Happy would that man who could unite them!"?unite them, that is through their natural opposition. And not many years later, Baudelaire wrote about the same subject, that nature does not "embellish" beauty because "nothing embellishes what is." "Nature teaches nothing. ... It drives man to kill, devour and torture his fellow man; for as soon as we depart from the plane of necessity and want to enter the plane of luxury and pleasure, we see that nature can only sponsor crime." One must remember that Baudelaire viewed nature morally. For just as Blake had revolted against the pedantic portraits of Reynolds with their stylized imagina tion-less nature, so Baudelaire revolted against the complacent eighteenth century acceptance of nature as "the source of all good" which led men back to original sin?the lust for power. The violence of both their reactions forced them finally into accepting nothing but the imagination. Whether finally Blake's antagonism to Newton and Locke and Baudelaire's distrust of "la mode na turelle" were healthy in extreme, is unimportant. In their desire to affirm the best processes of human perception, they were able to preserve for poetry?what we feel for such poets as Mac Leish, is lost today?the dignity of the human imagination. And theirs remains the highest criticism of poets living within a civic society before collective social action could be made effective. When the poetic imagination penetrates the eclectic disunity of the phenomenal world (which is constantly drawing man outward and subserving knowledge to sensation), the materials of nature are bent inward to human experience to form momentarily an integration between man and his world; thereby the imagination reveals the intrinsic possibilities of his conquest over nature through a conscious creative act as opposed to metaphysical specu lation. Metaphysical speculation, in modern terms, circumscribes the possibilities of a human conquest over nature both by accept ing the immanent truth of the fluxive movement of nature and by allowing it to remain entirely on the plane of sensation. From sensation it either builds a philosophic system of abstraction ex</page><page sequence="10">394 by EDWIN HONIG eluding the human will through experience?which is the death of desire such as we find in Eliot?or it endows nature with supreme consciousness and tries to read into it all human experi ence?which yields the characteristic nostalgia of anthropomorph ism in MacLeish. The poetry of MacLeish,?the heavy-laden profusions of ima gery, the emotions drawn out into poems that are too long to sus tain their dramatic truth, the idolized, paganized compassion for the sun as fertility and the moon as dearth, and the mythic flesh-proud man,?does it not through even its most compelling nostalgia, its most demonstrative amorality, lead one back to the same 18th century acceptance of original sin? Is it not an indica tion of resourceless spirit,?in the words of W. B. Yeats?"the will trying to do work of the imagination"? What is it then, in the works of traditional poets in the past that one can see as indication of the imagination-above-the-will, the historic-above-the-documentary? It is first, a line of gradual 'spiritual' evolvement, from one plane of experience to another. without the manifest imposition of an exterior 'fate', an alien out ward resolution. In other words, it is the very evidence of 'inner' history not betrayed. Again, it is the evidence of criticism through the stages of 'inner' evolvement?never a documentary but an historic criticism: i.e. as it involves the poet's sense of his own destiny in his own age. Thus, the surest mark of its presence is never in the explicit subjective terms of the experience of one poem but in the objective implicit terms of the experience of many poems, through the lines of independent continuity. (Consider in this sense the 'inevitable' evolution of Rimbaud from his short poems to Saison en Enfer; of Blake, from Songs of Innocence to Songs of Experience to the Prophetic Books.) MacLeish's art, on the other hand, is an art of simple eclectic ism that has temporarily found anchorage in an ideological and technical fixation?the ideal of 'social' democracy and the poten tialities of radio for the communication of poetry as "public speech". What virtue there may be in the attempt to extend the poetic medium through radio, is perhaps still a matter for con troversy. The point to consider is that for MacLeish it is part of a restive eclecticism that views the problem of art and com munication subjectively: an eclecticism that periodically feels the</page><page sequence="11">HISTORY AND MacLEISH 395 need for contracting new stimuli from the outside to offset the in ner process of "natural decay". As for his ideal of 'social' demo cracy, in as much as it is actualized through slogans in his plays, and in his sporadic philosophic pronouncements, it reveals itself as allied with a form of opportunism. It is an opportunism which seems to be not that of an expressedly humanitarian culture so much as of some group of persons using it to influence the course of state power. It is not so much identified with the ideals of a socialist society as it is with the constantly shifting language of the political arena. A poetry which has some body of imaginative reference is by that same token objectively critical to the sub stance of both its own contemporary and past experience in their most typically human form. The poetry which is circumscribed by primarily technical, impressionistic, and eclectic concerns can only be subjectively critical. It is the difference between an 'historical' poetry and a 'documentary' poetry. V The overt emphasis placed by poets during the past two or three decades upon the problem of verse technique and poetic experimentation?whatever definite effect it may have had in 'liberating' the medium from Victorian anachronisms?has served to distort the conception of poetry as an investment of the human imagination. It has led not only to the creation of a specialized craftsman's art, but has frozen the imagination on the plane of pure sensation and eclecticism; and in so doing it has denied the use of poetry as an historical instrument, or as a self-sustained human contribution to contemporary culture. It has either taken up the romantic cudgel against the impinging natural sciences as a mind shackling demon, or has subjected itself unwittingly to the docu mentary truth of science as a sort of 'superior' investigator into the reality of the contemporary human situation. On the one hand, it has gloried in its flight from social instrumentation, and on the other, it has contented itself almost entirely with 'represent ing' man in his daily social experience as the pawn of some his toric or theological or mythological fate of which he is either ter ribly conscious or terribly unconscious. Almost nowhere has it realized the forms of historical materialism and the natural sciences</page><page sequence="12">396 by EDWIN HONIG as parallel manifestations of the poetic imagination working with the same contemporary materials in another context but in the same culture. In abusing or in outlawing completely the poten tiality of historical consciousness and scientific investigation them selves as materials for the poetic imagination, it has chained itself to the wheel of mystical or ideological prejudice and willful cul tural dehumanization. And this is the morass that Archibald MacLeish?for all his fine words about 'humanity'?and his fel low-travellers of similar sensibility have left English poetry in America; while the minor eclectics still working under the influence of French symbolism and surrealism, contribute little in the way of conscious alleviation. The poetic imagination still remains to fulfill its historical r?le. The task of consciously assimilating, not imitating, Joyce, Eliot and the symbolists, Wilfred Owen, Gerard Hopkins, and Hart Crane, still demands resolution. Moreover, the cultural history of contemporary civilization from the Renaissance and the dis covery of America to the present, is still?despite the colossal documentary compendiums of Ezra Pound?unresolved in terms of the poetic imagination and in the implications of historical criticism through such an imagination. The poetic imagination also remains to fulfill a new, unprecedented historical r?le,?in the recognition of the reversability of poet into man of action. It is a subject that demands as high a degree of creative conscious ness as Karl Marx gave it in the field of political economy or Einstein in the field of astro-physics. But it is one of its features that it cannot be prophesied until its evidences come into being, as indeed, through the scattered works of the aforementioned, to gether with those of Blake, Baudelaire, Whitman, and Yeats, it seems to offer the unconcluded hints of perhaps some traditional imaginative justification.</page></plain_text>
