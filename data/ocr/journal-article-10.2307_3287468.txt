<plain_text><page sequence="1">Four Stages of Greek Religion. Studies based on a Course of Lectures delivered in April, I912, at Columbia University. By GILBERT MURRAY. New York: Columbia University Press, 1912. Pp. 223. In the four divisions of this book Professor Murray presents a critical account of the characteristics of the four periods into which, according to his view, the history of Greek religion naturally divides itself. The style, as all readers of Mr. Murray's previous works would expect, is vigorous and even brilliant. Since the studies are intended for the general public, the author has carefully guided the reader through such difficulties as might present them- selves in the way of technical terms and unfamiliar allusions; but as the problems discussed are both difficult and important, the trained student also will find here much food for serious thought. In the first chapter, " Saturnia Regna," the writer discusses those obscure and savage religious practices which preceded the more enlightened religion of the great gods, the "Olympians," and which, though often ignored by the great thinkers of the fifth century, never ceased to exist in the dark background of popular belief. Since definite and trustworthy testimony about these "primitive" elements is scarce and fragmentary, searchers in this field have proceeded very generally by the method of analogy; the religious customs of uncivilized or semi-civilized peoples in all parts of the world have been freely used to explain ill-understood phases of Greek cult. This chapter, then, offers a sketch of the underlying strata of Greek religion studied from the point of view of the anthropologist. That the ground traversed by this method should be beset with objections and controversies is inevitable. Many readers will doubt whether the "year daemon," the "divine bull," the "kingly magi- cian," and other figures brought to our attention by the English school of anthropological religionists really played so great a part in the faith and the</page><page sequence="2">282 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL practice of the Greeks as we are asked to believe. But as it is not a part of Professor Murray's plan to argue these points in detail, it would be inappro- priate to consider them at length here. Suffice it to say that in its net results, this chapter seems to the reviewer both stimulating and instructive. We may accept the general correctness of Mr. Murray's view of this phase of Greek religion, even while we reject his, or Miss Harrison's, interpretation of individual phenomena. Numerous critics have warned us, with something too much of solicitude, against the pit- falls of the method and the vagaries of certain investigators. It is time to take stock, soberly and impartially, of the results accomplished; and if we do so, we shall hardly fail to acknowledge benefits. Perhaps the most serious indictment against the school above mentioned is that a vicious sort of intel- lectual inbreeding appears to be constantly going on among them. A accepts B's conclusions, often, it would seem, chiefly because they are B's, and adds something of his own; C and D follow suit, the nucleus with its accretions is passed back to the originator, and so the round begins again. The value of the whole movement must be judged by the extent to which it finds acceptance among the saner-and less irritable-critics of America and the continent of Europe; for among the English, if we leave Farnell and Marett out of the account-two weighty exceptions, to be sure-we begin to despair of unpre- judiced criticism proceeding from men whose own contributions to the study of religion entitle them to high regard. The second study, "The Olympian Conquest," treats of the origin of the Olympians and of their religious value. Mr. Murray regards them as the "mountain gods of the old invading Northmen," though he recognizes pre- Achaean, or Pelasgian elements in several of them, while some seem to have been taken over, rather than brought along, by the invaders. His estimate of the religious value of the Olympians is perhaps the most praiseworthy part of the book. He analyzes the Olympian movement into three elements (p. 81): "a moral expurgation of the old rites, an attempt to bring order into the old chaos, and an adaptation to new social needs." In all three directions he holds that it accomplished much, yet failed in the end, because of the obstinate persistence of older traditions, because of the moral and intellectual confusion that inevitably resulted from Olympian anthropomorphism, and because Olympianism was too universal to become an effective religion of the Polis. As for the real achievements of the Olympian religion, we must content our- selves, since extended quotation is impossible, with referring to Mr. Murray's eloquent words on pages 93-94. In the third study, aptly styled "The Failure of Nerve," Mr. Murray treats the highly complex religious tendencies of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. This division of the field presents extraordinary difficulties, and con- siderations of space preclude any attempt to follow him in his discussion of the philosophical, mystical, and astrological elements which, throughout this period, we find strangely intermingled with foreign cults, and with the remnants</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 283 of decadent Olympianism and of still older superstition. His sketch provides an excellent introduction to the subject, and the brief bibliography at the end of the chapter will be found useful. The fourth essay, "The Last Protest," deals somewhat more briefly with the pagan reaction against Christianity in the fourth century. Professor Murray's appreciation of it is based largely upon Sallustius' treatise On the Gods and on the World, a translation of which forms a very useful appendix to the book (pp. 187-214). The work as a whole, in spite of certain disputable positions, is both inter- esting and informing. American classicists will find it a valuable addition to their working apparatus.
