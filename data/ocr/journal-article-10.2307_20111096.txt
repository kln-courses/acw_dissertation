<plain_text><page sequence="1">Early Vaisnava Imagery: Caturvyuha and Variant Forms Doris Srinivasan George Mason University Otudents of the arts of Hindu India are closely fa miliar with evolving traditions of Vaisnava imagery from the Gupta period onward at such prominent sites as Udayagiri near Besnagar, Deogarh, Badami, Aihole, and Mamallapuram. The origins of these artistic traditions are less well known, however, and it is the purpose of this paper to suggest that exam ples of Vaishnava figurai sculpture and cult imagery may be dated as early as the second century before Christ. Also presented here is a description of the theological principles that gave rise to the early Vaishnava images, and an attempt is made to dis tinguish between such concepts as vy?ha and avatar by which Vaishnava theologians designated different nuances of the process of divine manifestation. This study thus touches upon a major theme in the history of Hinduism, the formation of the cult of Visnu out of three distinct schools of religious thinking. Vaishnavism developed its own theological doc trine to explain the nature of the Supreme. The con cept of vyuha (literally, "placing apart; orderly ar rangement") attempts to outline the fundamental nature of the supreme God as well as the relation ship between God and his personal manifestations. As numinous Power, God is identified with the all pervading Brahman. However, this Power makes itself manifest in a series of four successive emana tions (caturvy?ha1) that are both identical to the numen and, at the same time, are the cause for the creation of the phenomenal world. In this way, the vyuha doctrine affirms a causal relation between the numinous and the phenomenal, without assigning limitations conditioned by time, change, form, or will upon the Supreme who is the creator of all these delimitations. In this system, V?sudeva, liter ally, "the indwelling deity," is the first emanation and the fountainhead of the successive emanations, which may be represented either anthropomorphi cally or theriomorphically in Hindu art. It has recently been recognized that the catur vyuha concept was plastically portrayed in the Ma thura school of art in the Kushan period.2 The icon comes from the Satsamudri Well situated on the compound of the Mathura Museum, and is now housed in the Museum. Though fragmentary, enough remains of this important statue to identify the cen tral crowned image as Vasudeva (Fig. 1). He wears a necklace, a garland of flowers, armlets, and brace lets. His high mukuta is decorated with overlapping circles. Vasudeva is four-armed. The natural right hand is in abhaya mudr?; the raised right hand rests on a highly ornamented mace. (The sculpture frag ment of the mace, although of the same buff sand stone as the other three fragments comprising this sculpture, is not joined correctly with the other parts.) Vasudeva's raised left hand is broken; the natural left hand holds an object identified as a conch by R. C. Agrawala (see note 2). One emanating form is seen projecting from Vasudeva's right shoul der (Fig. 2). This manifestation, wearing a single earring, is shown holding a wine cup in his left hand; his right arm should have been raised in front of the existing serpent-hood canopy. Two other forms originally projected from Vasudeva. One em anated from his crown; the head and right arm of the form are now broken. The fragment of a shawl remains draped over the left shoulder. A fourth fig ure, completely lost, should have emanated from Vasudeva's left side; this may be inferred from the break above the god's left shoulder.3 A Gupta-period textual reference to this sort of emanating type, in the Visnudharmottara-Pur?na, assigns the right or southern side to the emanation known as Samkar sana (also called Baladeva or Balar?ma4), represented 39</page><page sequence="2">the Museum in 1956. It is a colossal (167 cm high and 58 cm wide) buff-colored sandstone image sculpted on four sides. Each sculpture appears above an un decorated plinth approximately 46 cm in height. Perhaps the plinth of this upright was placed into the ground, leaving the carved sides exposed for the purpose of circumambulation and adoration.7 On one side stands a corpulent figure who seems to be more important than the others because he wears a crown and heavy earrings (Fig. 4). The fig ure raises the right arm, adorned with several brace lets; the hand is in abhaya mudra, emblematic of divinity. The left arm, also decked with bracelets, is posed in a somewhat relaxed manner; a decorated jar is held in that hand. The deity wears additional ornamentation in the form of a broad, flat necklace with a large central amulet. An upper garment (ut tariya) is draped over the shoulders. The drapery folds of the dhoti fall in the center and indications of the cloth are still visible on the thighs. The dhoti is held by a girdle fitting tightly around the loins and accentuating thus the lower portion of the abdomen. On the reverse side appears another full standing figure which may be sharply distinguished from the one on the obverse (Fig. 5). The personage wears no crown and, except for a bracelet on his left wrist, the body is starkly devoid of ornamentation. Nev ertheless, there are some noteworthy features. The figure's hair is parted in the middle and falls in strands onto either side of the shoulders. Both hands are broken but probably the right was raised in abhaya mudra while the left may have held a flask (the object is too effaced to be properly identified). Fig. i.

The identification is not problematic; a snake canopy, wine cup, and single earring are char acteristics regularly associated with Kushan-period icons of this god.6 Rather puzzling, however, is the clear and direct visual expression of a complex theo logical notion; this clarity of expression implies a prior phase of artistic experimentation and concep tual familiarity wherefrom a meaningful synthesis of religious, iconographie, and stylistic idioms could result. It is therefore of considerable interest that a fourfold image in the State Museum, Lucknow, rep - resents a formative, pre-Kushan portrayal of the caturvyuha concept (see Figs. 3-7). The piece in question comes from Bh?t? (District Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh), and was acquired by 40 Fig. 2. Vishnu Caturvyuha. Photograph, Doris Srinivasan.</page><page sequence="3">The figure is bulkier than the crowned one, and the belly protrudes even more over the constricting waistband. Adjacent to the right side of the crowned figure occurs, at the level of the crowned face, another face; it is completely damaged8 (Fig. 6). There are no other corporeal details. However, the entire lower portion of this side, corresponding roughly to the region between the hips and feet of the crowned fig Samkarsana Simha/N?rasimha Pradyumna K?pila/Raudra WEST EAST Vasudeva Saumya Aniruddha Var?ha Fig. 3. Vaishnava Caturvyuha, from Bhita, disposition of vyuhas (State Museum, Lucknow, no. 56.394). ure, is allotted to the frontal image of a seated lion. Adjacent to the left side of the crowned figure, a similar alignment exists. Another damaged face oc curs in the upper portion; only traces of the ears, earrings, and a heavy V-shaped necklace remain9 (Fig. 7). The lower portion also contains an animal. The profile view is that of a boar standing with hind legs on a high pedestal. The animal raises his head in the direction of the crowned figure and his paws come together in a gesture approximating namas k?ra. The second-century-B.c. date that N. P. Joshi as signs to this piece seems to be the most reasonable.10 The image compares well with other colossal Sunga period figures from north central India. Indeed, when compared to a series of colossal yaksas, the dating of the piece may be further refined. For example, the two standing figures of the Bhita icon show, in the modeling of masses, a slight advancement over the static, bilateral Sunga Yaksha from Pratapgarh (Dis trict Pratapgarh, Uttar Pradesh). The stiff posture of the Pratapgarh Yaksha (Fig. 8), its blockish con Fig. 5. Western side of no. 56.394. Fig. 6. Southern side of no. 56.394. Fig. 7. Northern side of no. 56.394. 41 Re. 4.

Even though none of these works can be given a narrowly precise date, it may be sug gested that the Bhita icon belongs to the first half of the second century b.c., and possibly to the sec ond quarter ofthat century. Perhaps the stylistic affinities between the Bhita image and the yaksha model caused Joshi to con sider the Bhita colossus as a fourfold yaksha image. Joshi observes, however, that certain iconographie Fig. 8. Pratapgarh Yaksha. h. 1.150 m, w. 0.440 m. Allahbad Museum, AM 1.

Further, the Bhita standing figures, though affixed to a central core, exhibit a greater sense of roundness than the afore mentioned free-standing yakshas. On the other hand, the Bhita figures anticipate the stylistic developments found in the VidiS? Yaksha of the second half of the second century B.c.13 (Fig. 11). The Vidisa Yaksha displays more subtle skin tonalities, a greater relax ation and naturalism in hand gestures, and a more convincing and unified flow of corporeal masses. 42 Fig. 9. Parkham Yaksha.

The figure on the reverse, unadorned and with loosely falling hair, may, he suggests, have some connection with &amp;va. And the figure on the obverse, together with the two lateral images, may illustrate "some earlier practice of depicting Vishnu with his boar and lion forms. . . ."14 It is possible to develop these interesting sugges tions further. In this paper it is proposed that the crowned image be identified as the first vyuha, Va sudeva; that the head and seated lion panel to the right of Vasudeva, combining anthropomorphic and theriomorphic elements, be identified as Samkar shana,15 the second vyuha; and that the reverse full figure, together with the head and boar panel, be identified as the third and fourth emanations, re spectively, of the fourfold division of the supreme Godhead.16 Seen as such, the emanations are dis tributed and represented in a manner akin to both the Mathura Museum Caturvyuha (see Fig. 1) in that each emanation has a human face. They also Fig. il. Vidisa Yaksha. Photograph, Frederick M. Asher. are related to later textual prescriptions of the more developed icons of Vishnu Caturvyuha that come to be called Vaikuntha (literally, "the keen, the pen etrating irresistible") and Vishnu Caturm?rti. The name Vaikuntha, according to the textual evidence, should be reserved for those four-faced Vishnu im ages where the god, either alone or with his consort, rides on Garuda. When Garuda is absent, as for ex ample in the Kashmiri type to be discussed below, the designation Caturmurti (four-faced image) is appropriate.17 The designation Caturvyuha is ap plied to those icons that also omit Garuda and the consort and that focus on the theme of divine em anation by depicting a fourfold Vaishnava image. To demonstrate the close correspondence between the Bhita image and the Vaishnava textual sources, it is instructive to quote the aforementioned Vish 43 Fig. ?o. Noh Yaksha. Photograph, Frederick M. Asher.</page><page sequence="6">These are (given in the same order as the above names): east, south, west, and north. Banerjea seems to have erred in identifying the left or northern (boar) face as that of Pradyumna and the western one (kapila or raudra, the terrific or fierce) as that of Aniruddha.23 A comparison between Vishnu Vaikuntha and Caturmurti icons and the fourfold Sunga image from Bhita shows many iconographie parallels.24 Vaikuntha and Caturmurti icons from Kashmir of fer the closest reflections of the textual descriptions, and seem to have enjoyed a special popularity dur ing the early medieval period. A ninth-century-A.D. fragmentary Vishnu Caturmurti in the Prince of Wales Museum, Bombay, illustrates the classic Kash miri type25 (Fig. 12). The central figure has a human face wearing an elaborate triple-crested crown. The body is ornamented with earrings, a necklace, the yajnopav?ta, and the Srivatsa mark on the chest. To the right projects the face of a lion; to the left that of a boar. On the reverse appears the fierce-looking face called Kapila26 (Fig. 13). This face, devoid of ornamentation, sports only simple circular earrings and a plain chain around the neck. The hair is worn as jat?mukuta, that is, twisted and gathered upon the head, with loosely falling locks cascading on either side of the shoulders. Clearly each of the four m?rtis of this image displays iconographie traits that correlate with those of the Bhita image.27 It is only in the placement of the forms, especially in the elim ination of the rectangular dispositioning, that the major iconographie innovation occurs. The placement of forms seen in the Kashmiri Vishnu Caturmurti may stem from a type devel oped in the Mathura school during the Gupta pe riod. Gupta images from Mathura show a certain flexibility regarding the position of the animal heads. A small statuette of a standing Vishnu (Fig. 14) in the Mathura Museum, coming from the village of Khammi (six miles from Mathura city) may be cited as an example. The front visage is human; the side faces are those of a lion and a boar. There is no fourth face.28 Two of Vishnu's four arms are broken; the remaining two hold a wheel and mace placed, respectively, on the heads of a cakrapurusa and gadadev?.29 In this icon, however, the lion and boar positions are reversed, being to the left and right, respectively, of the central figure.30 The more Fig. 12.

His complexion would be like that of a cloud, laden with water. He has four faces and eight arms. The eastern face is called Saumya [i.e., placid], the southern N?rasimha [man-lion]..., the western K?pila18 [the fierce face], and the northern Var?ha [the boar face]. . . ."19 This type of icon is called Vaikuntha Vishnu in another chapter of the same text.20 The iconography of the Vaikuntha image is corroborated in the Jay?khya Samhit?, a P?ncar?tra text also dated to the Gupta period that describes the four-armed Vaikuntha type as follows: "The Lord, creator of the universe, is to be meditated upon as having four faces?Vaikuntha [Vasudeva?], Narasimha, Varaha, and Kapila?and four hands holding the conch-shell, the disc, the club, and the lotus . . . mounted on Garuda. . . ."21 The Vish nudharmottara also assigns the following names to the four faces of Vishnu: Vasudeva, Samkarshana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha.22 These are the names of deified heroes belonging to the Vrsni clan, prom inent in the Mathura region at the beginning of the Christian era. In combining the information in Vish nudharmottara m.44, m.78, and m.79, it is possible to determine the directions prescribed for the faces. 44</page><page sequence="7">Badoh and dates approximately to the eighth cen tury a.D. It cannot be called a Vaikuntha Vishnu, nor is it like the Kashmiri Caturmurti discussed above; it seems to represent a development related to both the Vaikuntha and avatara themes. Although the aforesaid Vaikuntha and Vishnu Caturmurti icons display numerous iconographie variations, they do not disagree in the area of re ligious thought. They are all expressions of the vyuha doctrine, and in each case the four configurations represent emanations of God.34 The vyuha doctrine emphasizes the distinction between God as supernal power and the concretized emanations proceeding from that power. In postulating the fourfold per sonal emanations of the One, the doctrine insists that God makes himself known in the universe through a process of emission. The assumption is that the eternal, all-encompassing One has the potentiality to bring forth from out of himself that which he encompasses. In realizing this potentiality, a chain of emanations is emitted from God. The first four of these, the vyuhas, are emitted to cause creation of the phenomenal world and give form to the Fig. 14. Vishnu with lion and boar heads. H. 29 cm. Photograph, Government Museum, Mathura. conventional arrangement, with the lion on the right, etc., occurs equally well in Gupta Mathura images.31 There is an interesting Vishnu-Caturmukha in the Gwalior Museum that reflects vestiges of the ico nography considered in this paper.32 One side shows a four-armed, well-ornamented Vishnu seated on Garuda (Fig. 15). Vishnu wears a mukuta, vana m?l?, and yajnopavita. Although the attributes are considerably mutilated, it is possible to discern that a sword was held in the upper right hand and a disc in the upper left hand. As such, the image has simi larity with several Vaikuntha images discussed by Desai;33 indeed, in that the god is mounted on Ga ruda, the image adheres to the prescribed mode of portraying Vaikuntha in the Jayakhya Samhita and the Vishnudharmottara. On the three other sides, continuing counterclockwise, are representations of Trivikrama, Narasimha, and Varaha; a lotus con figuration is carved on top (Figs. 16-19).

Basically there are two ways in which the emanative process is indicated. The first is represented by the Mathura Caturvyuha icon dated to the Kushan pe riod (see Figs, i and 2). In this icon, the vyuhas quite literally spring from the fountainhead, that is, from the central figure of Vasudeva. This seems to have been the prevalent manner of depicting the emanative process during the Kushan period; it can be noticed on several other Kushan pieces in the Mathura Museum.36 Although the process of emis sion is forcefully indicated in nos. 392-395, lost is the notion of successive emanations (that is, one en tity arising directly and only from the preceding entity). This notion, however, is well symbolized in the second manner of representation. This schema allows for a quadrilateral disposition of forms such that V (Vasudeva) is adjacent to 'b' (Samkarshana, the vyuha emitted by V), which is adjacent to V (the vyuha emitted by 'b'), etc. Interestingly, this disposition of forms can follow the pradaksina patha orientation.37 The classic Kashmiri Caturmurtis re reflect this orientation even though the forms are not disposed on adjacent rectangular panels. The Gwalior Caturmukha exhibits the quadrilateral dis position although in this case all the vyuhas are not represented. Actually the clearest depiction of the second mode is found in the Bhita image (see Fig. 3). Two factors contribute to the disposition of forms in the Bhita image. The first is purely formal or functional. By the second century b.c., it had be come common practice to carve figures on the sides of an upright. Bharhut offers several examples. A cornered pillar, described by Cunningham as part of the outer railing of the st?pa, has "a single human figure on each of the two outer faces. . . ."38 The figures, dressed in dhoti and turban and well orna mented, stand with hands in a?jali mudra.39 On the corner pillar of the North Gate at Bharhut, three of the sides contain figures of yakshas and a yaksi.40 Important examples also come from other sites. The Allahabad Museum contains a late second-century B.c. corner post (no. am 68) of a railing from Nagod (Satna District, Madhya Pradesh) which relates to this iconographie theme.41 On two adjoining sides stand nearly identical yakshas holding their hands in anjali mudra. They are similar to the two yak shas on the Bharhut outer railing pillar. From Raj ghata comes a threefold Yaksha image that shares a noteworthy feature with the Bhita upright. The plain, square base supports an upper portion that is carved with figures on all sides. On the Rajghata upright, one yaksha, perhaps the main one, straddles the axis in a squatting posture (Fig. 20). The other two squatting yakshas (Figs. 21, 22) span the re maining two corners in such a way that they occupy the rest of the space. The Rajghata threefold Yaksha image (no. 97 in the Bharat Kala Bhavan) is like wise to be dated to the Sunga period.42 These ex amples show that there existed in north central India, during the second century b.c., the practice of de picting two or three addorsed figures on the sides of an upright; it thus seems altogether artistically appropriate that all the sides of an upright should have been chosen to depict a notion such as the caturvyuha. The second factor to influence the disposition of figures on the Bhita image is a religious one. The vuyuha doctrine postulates the fourfold form of the supreme God where every vyuha, being God, is identical with Him.43 This identity is well symbol ized by the disposition, as each of the four vyuhas face in each of the four cardinal directions. Indeed the notion of extending into the four quarters is associated with the verb vy/?h (the verb from which the noun vyuha is derived) in the vocabulary of the Vedic ritualists.44 Further, the vyuha doctrine main tains a strictly monotheistic view on the nature of God; accordingly the four emanations together rep resent cosmic completeness. From the time of the Rig Veda, the idea of Taring in the four directions' is connotative of spacial and cosmic totality; Agni in Rig Veda 5.48.5 is four-faced because the god, as flaming fire, extends into all the directions on earth and possibly beyond.45 The idea of cosmic com pleteness expressed by the vyuhas is well translated into stone by the disposition of the fourfold Bhita figures. In sum, the Bhita image is a felicitous result of prevailing sculptural practices and accepted reli gious symbolism. These are used to convey the be lief that the essential Oneness of the Supreme may be realized through contemplation of the quadruple outer forms emitted by Him.46 47</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 20. Fig. 21. Fig. 22. Rajghata Threefold Yaksha Image. Photographs, Bharat Kala Bhavan. The identification of the Bhita image as a Catur vyuha icon cannot be finally accepted, however, unless it can be shown that the vyuha theory, to gether with its core notion of cosmic emanation, were known in certain circles during the Sunga pe riod. Before discussing that point, it should be noted at the outset that a full flowering of the vyuha doc trine is a development characteristic of the Panca ratra system, whose texts (beginning ca. A.D. 600 800) give clear descriptions of this doctrine.47 However, the first statement of the basic doctrine occurs prior to the Pancaratra texts; it is already found in a section of the ?anti Parvan of the Mah? bh?rata called the N?r?yaniya (xn.321-338).48 The Narayaniya enounces the basic tenets of the vyuha doctrine in connection with the epiphany of the Su preme Narayana; the divine manifestation is granted to the Sage N?rada on the White Island (&amp;veta dv?pa). Narayana grants a vision of his universal self to Narada because the latter, as a true bhakta, is with all his heart devoted solely to the Lord.49 The supernal Narayana reveals his personal aspect, which he declares to be of quadruple form. These 48 forms are called his murtis,50 the first being that of Vasudeva, the Supreme Soul and Creator who orig inates the chain of successive conditioned forms: from Vasudeva springs Samkarshana, representing the living soul; from Samkarshana comes Pradyum na, the mind; and from Pradyumna comes Anirud dha, self-consciousness.51 It is highly significant and worthy of closer scru tiny that this early statement of the vyuha doctrine is made in connection with the Supreme Narayana. To state it another way, in defining the personal aspect of Narayana, the doctrine is expounded in connection with but one out of three possible divin ities that merge, in a series of stages, to give rise to the syncretic Hindu god, Vishnu. Although a com prehensive, philological analysis tracing the merger of the three major strains forming God in sectarian Vaishnavism is greatly needed, the general charac ter of these strains is well recognized.52 Vishnu, as known from the Puranas onward, is the amalgama tion of myths, philosophic notions, and religious doctrines associated with Vedic Vishnu, Vasudeva K?sna of the Bh?gavata school,53 and Narayana, an</page><page sequence="11">important cosmic god in the Br?hmanas and ?ran yakas, who continues in the Mahabharata and Pu ranas as a supreme god, especially in connection with creation.54 Of importance for the present study is that in the Narayaniya account, the vyuha doc trine defines the essential nature of the god of one Vaishnavite strain (Narayana), but associates the ac tual vyuhas with the names of four deities belonging to another Vaishnavite strain (the Bhagavata school). It thus appears as if the Narayaniya account brings two strains together in promulgating an early state ment of the fundamental doctrine.55 This remark able feature of the statement in the Narayaniya dic tates the method by which we may attempt to answer the question posed above. In order to de termine whether aspects of the vyuha doctrine were already in existence in the second century b.c., it is necessary to see whether aspects of the doctrine may be traced back to the two Vaishnavite strains that come together in the Narayaniya. And this we pro pose to do next. Narayana, a divine being of rather early Vedic occurrence, is in some way connected with the pri meval Waters (Laws of Manu i, 10). He comes to be identified with the Upanisadic Brahman (Tait tir?ya ?ranyaka x.ii; Laws of Manu i, 9, 10). Pas sages in the Satapatha Br?hmana (xii.3.4.1 if and xm.6.1.2) enable better apprehension of the devel opments leading up to Narayana's becoming the Supreme Principle. In this text, his name is hyphen ated with that of Purusa, the Cosmic Male of the ancient Vedic tradition.56 Accordingly, Satapatha Brahmana xii.3.4 states that Purusha-Narayana, hav ing thrice offered sacrifice, sent forth from that place the Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas. When Praj?pati told him to sacrifice again, then Purusha-Narayana placed himself in all the worlds, gods, Vedas, and vital airs, and they were placed in him (xii.3.4.11). This pas sage indicates that Purusha-Narayana is a generative force. In placing himself into apprehensible forms, he is, as it were, creating them. That these created forms are also 'placed' in him is a way of concep tualizing a correspondence felt to exist between the creative force and the forms he creates. This sort of conceptualization grows out of a Vedic school of thought that considers creation to occur by a process of emission.57 The idea is that cosmic creation may be viewed as an analogue of human parturition. That is, the creator, believed to contain all forms in side his belly, causes creation when he 'gives birth' to forms.58 This notion continues to be associated with Narayana in parts of the Mahabharata. For ex ample, in Mahabharata in. 186.90-117, M?rkandeya goes into the mouth of the cosmic god and sees the whole universe inside his body. There is additional indication that the idea of cosmic emanation is con nected with Narayana. Satapatha Brahmana xm.6.2 suggests that Purusha-Narayana is the author of the Purusas?kta (Rig Veda 10.90). The Vedic commen tary tradition also considers a Rsi Narayana as au thor of Rig Veda 10.90.59 For the present study, this attribution has particular significance. The Purusha sukta postulates that the whole universe takes shape as Purusha emits materiality from out of himself.60 Therefore the Satapatha Brahmana passage implies that the concept of cosmic emanation originates from Purusha-Narayana. The implications of these ideas are not lost in the later discussions of the vyuha theory contained in the Pancaratra texts. The Ahi budhnya Samhita, for example, in chapter 59, con nects the Purushasukta with the origin of the vyuha theory.61 To summarize, the evidence from Vedic and post Vedic literature shows that the idea of creation by emanation?the sine qua non of the vyuha doctrine62 ?relates consistently to the Narayana strain within Vaishnavism. On the other hand, however, the names of the vyuhas in the Narayaniya account do not come from the Vedic tradition.63 The names of Vasudeva, Sam karshana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha are the names of important hero-gods in the Bhagavata tradition. The Bhagavata religion, in contradistinction to the Vedic religion, emphasizes bhakti: intense personal devotion to a godhead (called Bhagavat, the wor shipful One). The manner of worship differs from the Vedic sacrificial rites. Bhagavat may be repre sented and worshiped in a concretized form (murti), sheltered in a sanctuary. He may also be represented aniconically, as a plant or symbol, or theriomor phically, and in these forms likewise receive wor ship. As part of the intense devotionalism to the personal god, dramas or religious performances may take place to recount his glories and experience his presence. The gods of the Bhagavata religion may have 49</page><page sequence="12">been human heroes who came in time to be deified. This development is discernible when information from the Mora Well inscription now in the Ma thura Museum, dating to the early decades of the Christian era,64 is taken together with information gleaned from the Brahm?nda and V?yu Puranas. The Mora Well inscription refers to a stone shrine in which were placed five images (archas) of the blessed (bhagavat) five heroes (pancaviras) of the Vrishni clan.65 Vayu Purana 97.1-2 states that these five heroes were originally human and named Sam karshana, Vasudeva, Pradyumna, Samba, and Ani ruddha. They are all closely related to each other, being related in one way or another to Vasudeva Krishna: Samkarshana (Balarama) is the older brother of Vasudeva-Krishna; Pradyumna and Samba are his sons; and Aniruddha is his grandson, being the son of Pradyumna. Although the worship of Samba declined, the worship of the remaining four even tually brought them into contact with the vyuha notions. In tracing a general overview of this con tact, it is useful to determine the pre-Christian-era trends pertaining to three religious phenomena: (1) deification of the Vrishni heroes; (2) their associa tion with the god Narayana; and (3) the association of the vyuha notion of successive emanation with the four Vrishni hero-gods. Evidence for the deification of some of the Vrishni heroes exists from the time of P?nini (ca. 400 b.c.) onward. S?tra iv.3.98 in the Ast?dhy?yi has been interpreted by several scholars as a reference to the worship of Vasudeva.66 The Milindapa?ha includes the Vasudeva cult in a list of cults centering around folk deities;67 the core of this text may go back to pre-Christian times although in its present form it is several centuries later. Pata?jali's Mah?bh?sya (ca. mid-second century b.c. to the beginning of the Christian era68) is very informative on the growth of the Vasudeva-Krishna cult. In commenting on Panini's sutra rv.3.98, Patanjali states that Vasudeva is the name of Krishna, whose worshiper is called Vasudevaka;69 he also speaks of the existence of temples dedicated to Kesava (Vasudeva-Krishna), R?ma (Balarama), and Kuvera.70 References in the Mahabhashya to the binding of Bali, the killing of Kamsa by Krishna or by Vasudeva, the narration and presentation of dramas depicting Krishna's life and deeds71 show that Patanjali knew Vasudeva as 50 Krishna and also he knew of an expanded Bhagavata cult containing elements already considered old at the time of Patanjali.72 Evidence in support of developments noted in the Mahabhashya comes from a series of coins issued by the Indo-Greek king Agathocles (reigning ca. 180 165 b.c.).73 The two divinities on the obverse and reverse of this coin type have been associated with Vasudeva-Krishna and Samkarshana.74 Each figure stands under an umbrella (Figs. 23-24).

The same attributes are associated with another sec ond-century-B.c representation of (Samkarshana-) Balarama, namely, the well-known Sunga sculpture in the State Museum, Lucknow.76 The Lucknow Balarama, the Agathocles coins, as well as the fa mous Heliodoros pillar inscription at Besnagar77 (also of the second century b.c.) corroborate the textual evidence. It seems very likely that in the several centuries before the Christian era at least two of the Vrishni heroes were deified. Further, the advent of devotionalism to Bhagavata gods stimulated Bhaga vata icons, and the cult had become sufficiently es tablished to attract Yavanas and/or people under their rule. The Ghos?ndi Stone Inscription78 (near Nagari, Chitorgadh District, Rajasthan) of about the second half of the first century b.c., testifies to the associ ation of two Bhagavata gods with the Vedic cosmic god Narayana. The inscription records the erection of a stone enclosure for the purpose of worship in the Narayana compound for the blessed (bha gava[d]bhy?m) Samkarshana and Vasudeva. That is, within the sacred precinct of the god Narayana was set up a sacred object79 dedicated to the two Bhagavata gods. The inscription thus goes a long way in documenting the gradual merger of the two Vaishnavite strains. The order in which the names of the Bhagavata gods occur in the compound of the Ghosundi inscription is also noteworthy. In that Samkarshana is mentioned before Vasudeva, the ge nealogical order is being given and not the meta physical order, valid in the vyuha doctrine. The same order occurs in the N?n?gh?t (Maharashtra) inscription of about the same period.80 These inscriptions may lend support to my earlier observation that the vyuha doctrine originates from outside of the Bhagavata tradition. Were it other wise, then it would seem to me that the metaphysical order should have been recorded, given the Bhaga vata religious climate of the first century b.c. The chief text of the Bhagavatas, the Bhagavad G?ta (ca. second century b.c. - second century A.D.) substan tiates this view. The Gita displays no knowledge of the vyuha doctrine, though its teachings also do not go counter to it. It is my understanding that vyuha notions stemming from the sphere of Narayana came to be associated with the Bhagavata gods as a result of the gradual merging tendencies within Vaishna vism itself.81 That these tendencies had already be gun in the late pre-Christian period can be deduced from the following passage in the Mahabhashya, in which Patanjali probably alludes to the vyuhas in his commentary on Panini vi.3.5.82 The passage reads: jan?rdanas tv ?tmacaturtha eva?"Jan?rdhan, whose self is fourth." Jan?rdhana, another name for Krishna, is here cited as one member presumably of a group of four. It is likely that the reference is to the caturvyuha concept. In conclusion, both the artistic and religious tra ditions of the Sunga period allow for the possibility of a plastic expression of the caturvyuha concept. Some brief remarks concerning the political climate may be in order here. The Sungas (ca. 185-75 b.c.), as is well known, were brahmans and strong ad herents of Brahmanical traditions. Pusyamitra, the founder of the dynasty, celebrated, according to the Ayodhy? inscription of Dhanadeva,83 two Vedic Asvamedha sacrifices. Indeed this period witnessed a variety of Vedic rites; the Mahabhashya mentions domestic sacrifices as well as large soma sacrifices such as the Agnistoma, R?jas?ya, and V?japeya. Not only Brahmanic ceremonies but also Bhagavata ones gained prestige. To the aforementioned iconic, tex tual, and inscriptional indicators of Bhagavata ac tivity in this period, additional evidence may be cited. Another stone pillar from the region of Bes nagar carries an inscription, dated to the second cen tury B.c.,84 recording the setting up of a Garuda flagstaff of the Lord Purusottama by ... a worshiper of Vishnu. Apparently the political atmosphere in north central India favored the marked artistic and religious readiness to formulate a caturvyuha icon. The Bhita image, it is proposed, is the result of these cultural currents. 51</page><page sequence="14">Notes Editor's note.

Debala Mitra (Visnu Chaturm?rti Image in the Hari R?i Temple at Chamba, pp. 1-12) briefly discusses this Bhita image, and concludes that it represents "the earliest sculpture so far discovered ... to render the form of Chaturm?rti . . ." (p. 3). I prefer to label it as a caturvyuha image. She also identifies the boar panel as symbolic of Aniruddha, and the Kapila figure as that of Pradyumna, on the basis of Vishnudharmottara 111.78.1 and in.79 (see below). 17. P.

This sculpture, like no. 73.4, portrays the ob verse central human figure wearing an ornamental crown and numerous decorations; the reverse fierce face features similar simple earrings, necklace, and jat? with cascading locks. An un usual feature in this icon is that both the lateral faces are that of a lion. 28. The Kapila face can also be absent in Kashmiri images, as in the Vishnu bronze in the Museum f?r Indische Kunst, Berlin, discussed by H.

Gupta, The Caturvyuha and the Vis?kha-y?pa in the P?n car?tra, pp. 189 ff., discusses the formulation of the Visakha-yupa concept in the P?ncar?tra system as an aid in meditation. The y upa (pillar) to be visualized is that of the caturvyuhas; each vyuha occupies one side of the pillar. The Laksm? Tantra specifies that Vasudeva is to be visualized on the eastern section; Sam karshana faces south; Pradyumna, west; and Aniruddha, north. The central hiatus is considered to be filled with his all-encom passing, transcendental Self (Brahman). An earlier P?ncar?tra text, the Satvata Samhita, already has an allusion to the envi sioning of the four vyuhas in connection with the Visakha-yupa concept. Could the plastic representation of the caturvyuha con cept in the pre-Christian period be related to the later meditative device, the Visakha-yupa? 47.

The same school is designated around the Christian era as S?tvata, after the clan that worshiped Vasudeva-Krishna as the Supreme Being.

Bhandarkar (ibid., p. 32) emphasizes this point strongly in stating, "The burden of the whole Narayaniya section seems to be this identity between Narayana and Vasudeva." 56.

Srinivasan, The Religious Significance of Multiple Bodily Parts to Denote the Divine: Findings from the Rig Veda, p. 171, fn. 142. 57. Similar sets of correspondences are already set up in hymns of the Atharva Veda. In these hymns, creation is an emanative process. The Creator emits or emanates from his own Being the outer forms comprising materiality. See D. Srinivasan, The Religious Significance of Divine Multiple Body Parts in the Atharva Veda, Numen, 25.3 (1979), concerning the Skambha Hymns. 58. See Srinivasan, The Religious Significance of Multiple Bodily Parts to Denote the Divine: Findings from the Rig Veda, pp. 143-147; and The Religious Significance of Divine Multiple Body Parts in the Atharva Veda. 59. The attribution comes from S?yana's commentary on Rig Veda 10.90. 60. Srinivasan, The Religious Significance of Multiple Bodily Parts to Denote the Divine: Findings from the Rig Veda, pp. 171-172. 61. See Schrader, Introduction to the P?ncar?tra and the Ahir budhnya Samhit?, p. 143. It is most interesting that, in the Sata patha Brahmana xm.6.1, Purusha-Narayana is associated with a p?ncar?tra sacrifice. The passage declares that Purusha-Narayana perceived the p?ncar?tra sacrifice (a sacrifice lasting five days) and performed it in order to obtain supremacy over everything in the universe. For a brief survey of the indebtedness of the caturvyuha notion to the Purushasukta, see Gupta, The Catur vyuha and the Vis?kha-y?pa in the P?ncar?tra, pp. 194-196. 62. One name of the western face of the Vishnu Vaikuntha and Caturmurti icons affirms the integral nature of the emana tion theory in the vyuha doctrine. The face called Kapila prob ably is associated with the sage Kapila, reputed founder of the Samkhya school of philosophy. Samkhya believes that the world came into being through the successive emanation of a chain of elements. See S. Dasgupta, A History of Indian Philosophy, reprint (Cambridge, 1951), vol. 1, chap, vu; G. J. Larson, Classical S?mkhya (Delhi, 1969), esp. chap. 11. The doctrine of emanation, as described in the Samkhya system, had a profound influence on cosmogonie theories developed in the Mahabharata and Puranas; see P. Hacker, The S?nkhyization of the Emanation Doctrine Shown in a Critical Analysis of Texts, Wiener Zeitschrift f?r die Kunde S?d- und Ostasiens v (1961): 75-112. 63. The present study does not attempt to trace the origin of Krishna worship, or the association of the name Krishna with that of Vasudeva, and it does not explore the fact that a sage Krishna is mentioned in Vedic literature from the time of the Rig Veda to the time of the Chandogya Upanishad; see Bhan darkar, Vaisnavism, Saivism, and Minor Religious Systems, p. 11. Whether this is the Krishna who comes to be associated with Vasudeva is not very clear. R. N. Dandekar, in Some Aspects of the History of Hinduism (Poona, 1967), p. 95, doubts it, discerning three separate religio-ethical trends combining to produce Hindu Krishna. 64. The inscription dates to the time of So?j?sa. On the rel ative dating, and other inscriptions of Sodasa, see H.

It attests to the spread of the Bhagavata cult further south. The progress of Bhagavatism southward into Andhra Pradesh is witnessed by the second century-A.D. Chinna inscription of Yajna-S?takarni (D. C. Sir car, Studies in the Religious Life of Ancient and Medieval India [Delhi, 1971], p. 21), and the late third-early-fourth-century A.D.

Abdul Wa heed Khan, An Early Sculpture of Narasimha, Andhra Pradesh Government Archaeological Series, no. 16 [Hyderabad, 1964]). 81. The Mahabharata illustrates these tendencies. For example, ?ranyaka Parvan, chap. 12, identifies (Vasudeva-)Krishna with Narayana. In chaps. 65 and 66 of the Bh?sma Parvan, Vishnu as the Supreme Spirit is addressed as Narayana and identified with Vasudeva-Krishna. The Mah?n?r?yana Upanisad, in a modifi cation of the Gayatr? mantra, identifies (in 111.78) Narayana with Vasudeva and Vishnu.
