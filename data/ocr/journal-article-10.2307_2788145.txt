By Aj Henry Balfour, M.A. Among the specimens comprised in the splendid ethnological collection recently brought home by Mr. P. Amaury Talbot from Southern Nigeria, is a large carved and painted ceremonial paddle, wllich is worthy of special record. I saw this specimeni in Mr. Talbot's private mtuseuim at his country house, and he generously offered to presenit it to the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford, an offer which I gladly accepted. Not only is the specimen possibly unique, but it is the sole remaining relic of a once famous Juju, all the other associated cult-objects having been destroyed during the iconoclastic campaigu instigated by tlle self-elected pseudo-prophet who called himself Elijah II, and whose fanatical movement started in December 1915.1 This paddle-shaped symbolic object belonged to the Kalabari (or Awome) people, in the Degema division of Southern Nigeria (the district lying between the coast and the lower reaches of the Niger proper). The main population of the Degema division is Ibo, but the Kalabari form a considerable element, occupying in the main a position to the south of the lbo. Mr. Talbot has informed me that the paddle formed part of the cult-paraphernialia of the dominant Ifawkaw (Fouche) jttju named Arnaniiigiu (tlhe serpelnt juju). The precise function and symbolic significance of the object are niot yet determined, but it is hoped that Mr. Talbot may yet be able to shed further light uponi this interestilig specimen. The carving is in bold relief, grotesque in design, and somewhat crudely executed. The details are elaborately picked out and emphasised with the help of a variety of colours (black, white, blue, pink, red, and yellow-ochre), and the whole effect is very striking, barbaric, and effective. The general style is characteristic of Kalabari workmanship. The humani or huumanised head at the top of the loom (Fig. 1), wearing a kind of tall hat and twisted side-locks, is said to represenit the Serpent juju, Amaiiingiu. The head is repeated, Janus-like, on the back. In the centre of the loom is another carvilng (also with its counterpart on the reverse), which is said to typify the Hippopotamus spirit. An identical rendering of this theme is seen in the Kalabari woodeni mask from Abolnnema, slhown in Fig. 3, in which are well seein tlle long, stouit tusks characterising these renderings of tlle hippopotamus, associated with general anthropomorphic features. This mask, wlich is carved from the solid wood, and measures 16 iriches by 8 iliches, was not worn over the face, but surmounted a head-dress wlich was worn in ceremonial plays, iil which it represented the hippopotamus water spirit. The carved details are exactly similar to those of the carving oIn the paddle. This specimeln was also giveni by Mr. Talbot to the Pitt Rivers Museum. The blade of the paddle exhibits oni the obverse (Fig. 1) relief carvilngs of a pair of human figures wearing ornanmental head-gear; below them are two snakes tightly coiled. Conventional lozenge-shaped figures, and, at the terminial point, a radiate coronoid design, complete the decoration. On the reverse side of the blade (Fig. 2) the treatment is similar, though varying in detail ; a pair of hIiumnian heads facing opposite directionis, a pair of coiled snakes (as on the obverse), a pair of flying birds, with a "filling" of lozenge designs, scalene triangcyles, and a terminal of the same form as on the obverse. The total length of tlle paddle is just under 5 feet 4 inches; the blade measures 20 incehes by 131 inelles. The wholesale destructioln of interesting cult-objects by the fanlatical adherents of "Elijah II " has robbed ethlnologists of a vast amounlt of valuable material, whicl can never be replaced ; anid in view of tlle holocatust wlhich characterised the raids * See P.
