VI.- ffiotes on the Linyoa Geral or Modern Ttlpf of the Amazonas. BY CH. FRED. HARTT, PROFESSOR OF GEOLOGY IN CORNELL UNIVERS}TY, ITHACA, N. Y. The great Tupi Guarani stock, in its migrations over South Arnerica east of the Andes, broke up, long ago, into a largs3 nuinber of tribes, wllich, living apart from one another, developed, in course of time, more or less distinct manners and customs, religious ideas, alld languages. Of these great divisions of the stock we have, for instance, the Guaranis of Paraguay; the ApiacEs of Central Brazil; the Mulldurucus, tlle Mauds, and OmEuas (Omaguas) of the Amazollas; the Tupis proper of the Brazilian coast and the Amazonas, now almost entirely civilized; and other tribes which I shall not llere enumerate. The lallguages of these tribes appear at first sight to diffier widely from olle allother; but, so far as we know, they all have the same general structure, and tlle roots are, to a greater or less extent, the same in all. Unlike the North American Indian tongues the languages of the Tupf-Guarani family are are llot polysyntlletic in structure, and the Tupi is remarkable for abounding in general terms. When Brazil was discovered tlle Tupi was spoken along the whole coast, and this led the old writers to give it the name Linyoa Seral Brazilica, or the general Brazilian language. Tlle Tupi was adopted by the Jesuits and used ill their intercourse with the natives. The tnissionaries preached and wrote in it, alld grammars, vocabularies, catechisms, prayers,</page><page sequence="2">On the Linyoa Gerat of the Amazorlas. 59 hymns, &amp;c., by Ancllieta, Figueilla, and others, are extant, tllough exceedillgly rale alld very difficult to obtaiIl. Of modern works on tlle old Tupi we have the dictionaries of v. Martius, Gongalses Dias, and Ferreira. All of these arc based on old lTocabularies, but they admit mally modern mrords and corlupted forms writtell witll the modified prolllln- ciation necessary for their adoption itltO tlae vulgar Portu- guese of Brazil. Tlle " Chrestomathia " of Ferreira is, beside, badly arranged, carelessly edited and disfigured by innumer- able typograpllical errors. Witll tlle civilization of the Indians, the Tupi has ceased to be spoken OI1 the coast, but in its modern form, the Lingoa Seefiat, it is still in use otl the Artlazollas from Pelu to the sea, not ollly by Indians of Tupi origill, but also by mally tribes of differellt stock. It is, in fact, tlle general lallgllage of the Amazonian tribes, and in some localities it is tlle only lan- guage spoken. Alollg the maiIl river and in tOWllS, the Pol- tugllese is fast superseding it, alld, with tlle rapid progless of civilization, the TupS must soon die out. But the Lillgoa Geral of the Amazollas is not tlle old Tupi of the Jesuits. In prollunciation and structure tlle two diXer even more tllall Spanish and Italian, and the prayers, llymns, &amp;c., of tlue Jesuits are uniIltelligible to the Amazonian Indian of to-day. It is extremely doubtful wlletl-ler in the times of the old Jesuits the Tupi of tlle Amazonas was completely identical with that of the coast of southern and middle Brazil, alld it is very probable that there were important local peculiari- ties not ollly in pronullciation but also in structure. Thou^,h the modern Tupi is spoken witll great uniformity os-er a vast region on both sides of the Amazonas, tllere are foulld, as might be expected, variations, especially in pl'OllUll- ciation, peculiar not ollly to the inhabitants of localities widely separated, but also of those close to one anothel. The eXects of that lazilless, whicll leads all nations to simplify the pronunciation of words by dropping certain soullds fi om difficult cornbinations, and slloltenillt, alld alld clippillg words, are also seen in tlle Lillgoa Geral. Tlle old Tupi llsed witll great vrequellcy tlle dollble letters</page><page sequence="3">nd and mb, the latter being often initial. Thowlgh the old forms are here alld there preserved7 the general tendency has been to shorten tllem by dropping the d froln nd and tlle b frozn mb. Thus the old form of the pronoun7 second person singular, was inde. Tllis is still frequently used, sspecially in certain localities, but tlle more common form is ine. So the old form menddr, to marly, has given way to mendr; but ill no case, so far as I have observed, has tlle n beell dropped leaving the d alone; in fact, this consonallt is never found unless combitled witll n. In the case of mb the b is usually dropped, very rarely it is tlle m; thus, the old form mbae, thing, is still largely used, but more commonly it is simplified to mae; I halre afewtimes heard bae. Mbotta is snake, btlt one 11ears mobta in one place alld botta in another. It is from this word that the Englisl word boa (-constrictor) is derixed. Terminal ad may become ad or 4, and mbae may be con- tracted to m4. The termiIlation dasa (dba old Tupi) is of very frequent occurrence, alld ill many places it is contracted to 4, as k'psdava, a hammock, kfis4; apRgdavaX (appdba, old Tllpi) a maIlX appg4. The illitial x (sll) is llere alld tllere replaced by an aspirate (h). Cllanges such as tllese cause the proilunciation to vary mucll in different localities, tlloug,l they may be accompanied by no important changes in the structure of the language. Of the modern Tupi or Lillgoa Geral there exists no pub- lislled grammar or dictionary. Tlle vocabulary of v. Martius is wretclledly small and very illaccurate. Tile best vocabll- lary is that of tlle Padre Seisas, published in Para in 1853, for the use of the Episcopal Seminary of that city. It is a pamplllet of sisty-six very small pages, alld is now out of print and extremely rare. 3ei2as was, llowever, very imper- fectly acquaillted with the language, and tlle vocabulary is full of errors. Col. Faria of Obydos, province of ParE, published in 1858 a pamplllet of 28 pp., elltitled (ywompendio da linyoa Brazilica, 60 * Where the y is very guttural I add n g. Sec page 62) post.  C. F.

Four years ago in tlle preparation of a volume 44 On tlle Geology and Pllysical Geography of Brazilj" I found it neces- sary to sttldy the derivation of the indigenous geograpllical names of tllat colliltly ill 01dCZ to arrive at tlleil oltllograpllv. F1I1dirLg this a diffictllt task witll tlle books at lwarld, I deter- mined to take advaaltare of a srisit to the Amazonas in 1870, to make myself familial witll the Lingoa Geral. While traveling I made it a pointX as far as possible, to secure as guides na- tives wllo spoke Tupi and, using a phonetic alphabet, I col- lected witll their aid, a considerable socabulary. As I became some:what familial witll tlle lallguage, I wlote down frote tlle lips of tlle natives lluIldreds (lf sentences illustratint, its gl alu- matical structure, alld, fillally, hasting trailled two of my guides to dictate tv) me iI1 Lillgoa Geral, I was able to collect dialobues, storiesX legelldsn mtrths &amp;c.

In addition to the above vowel sollnds thele is another represented by the letter (@), resembling tlle Ger- man u, but pronounced with a raising of the back part of tl-le tongue, as in the prc)llunciation of the German zeh, so tllat the vowel is accompanied by a more or less guttural sound, and it is as difficlllt to pronounce as to describe. In tlle word for water, fig, this guttllral loreatllillg is s-ery marked. Tlle SOUI14 may be imitated by placing the back of the tongue in a position illtermediate betweeIl that required fortlle pronun- ciation of the ch in ich, and the ch ill Buch, and thell attempt- ing to pronounce tlle Germall u. Tllis sarne sound occurs in MundurucS? Maue, and in ses-eral other Brazilian laIlguages. The diglapllk at, au, and oz occur in Lingoa Geral. The sounds repl e3sented bJr /, g, j (English, Frellch? or Por- tuguese), 5, v, x (ks), alld z, do llot occur; b is found ollly in the compound mb, or, vely rarely, in words originally pro- nounced with mb? from wllich the m llas been dlopped; d as already stated is found only in the compoulld nd, and Ilel er alone. The aspirate h occurs ollly in those rare instances wllere it replaces x (sh). A llasal soulld (g) is of very fre- quent occurrence especially aftel a short z as merzg little. There is also the combillation ctup, whicll is exactly the Portuguese ao (am). When tlle llasal forms part c)f a syllable in the middle of a word it always terminates it, and 1lo part goes over to the 1lext syllablev thus: purdpa beautiful, is prollollnced purdp-a and not purdp-ga. This makes the lang;uag;e soinewllat difficult to protlounce. Tlle g is some- times initial, as in pandg (enganar, Portuguese), to clleat. N pronounced as in Spallish, is very columon but it tends to pass into y. Tlle sound equi-alent to our English w I represent by as, to avoid it being mistaken for a v.* The only double consonants are rnb, nd, alld nt, the first two being usually contracted to m and n and tlle latter being restricted to the word intz not, so that, as the lalop uage is rich in vowels * In adopting a phonetic alphabet {or the Lirlgoa Geral I have strisen to make it lIS simple as possible and 1 havc based it on to the l'ortuguese so as to make it available in Brazil.

There are sevelal eupllollic cllallges which are interesting.

In tllis last case I have llever met with the form tupid, but olle fizlds dupsd in Mundurucu, and fioaztchakard ruped hen's egg. In Maue it is zatpakd opad. The same change of t or s illtO r, ill many instances, takes place in verbs after tlle prefised plonoun in the accusative: as sausu, (sausSb, old Tupi) to love, Ixe neratcsu I love tllee. Otller examples of this cllanne are as follows: Sete or tete body, serete my body; YuruparS devil, bad spirit; yuruparfratd llell. Sometimes an r is added betmTeen words for the sake of eupllony, thus: 6ka house, se-r-6ka, ser6ka, tny house. Malld p are to a certain extent interchangeable and we find mptuA and pfituu, to lest, and murasei and purc6sei, to dance. I llave elsewllere remarked that tlle narne Maranoll (Spanisll form) or Maranllao (Portut,uese form) applied to tlle Rio das Amazolwas is doubtless the same as parand sea or river, aIld I have found on tlle Tapajos Maranhaozinho as the Portuguese forle fol Parand;-mtrzg, literally, a little river. Tlle Iloun is indeclinable: smprd is tree, or trees. A col- lective form is made by addint, it4: kurumt (kurum6p) boy, kurumXta boys, in general. Tlle gellitive is denoted b- position, thus: apg4doa man; apfig4fioa figdrsc the man's canoe. Many notlns are formed by adding certain terrrlinatiolls to verbs or adjectives thus: Mondp to make; rnonapdava the place wllere something is made; monagdra tlle one who makes. Am.

Tllere being no proper conjulletions ill Lingoa Geral, cir- cumlocutioIls are used or tlle Portuguese forms are employed. Sometimes and is expressed by yutr (again). Adverbs and adverbial pllrases are numerous. Tlle follow- int are examples: ike Port. aqut? llere; mfme there; asdez (an) already; rete very, &amp;c. Several adverbs are formed from the noull mae (mbae) tlling (what), by adding adverbs or post-positions, thus: mae rese ? (for what ?) why ? mae- yaooe ? (like what ?) how ? mclekfity ? (toward what ?) whither ? maesq ? (fiom wllat ?) whence ? &amp;c. Post-positions al e tlumerous. The following are among the more importallt: arama for, in order to, kfitp to, towards, sut from y?pe inside of, d;rpe on top of, ope upon, irAm with, rWre after, s?lpe to. Some of the pOst-pOsitiotls are used as suffises: as for instance, Se (-me) in; 6kape in the house, parandrne in (o on) the river. I llave already spokell of the old form-b6 to, whicll appears isl the dative sing. and pl. of ixe and ine; in * The mother calls both son and daughter, mymylra; the father says tetyl? a son, talylra daughter.

The influence of the l'upi on the Portuguese, as spoken ill Brazil, llas beell, if anytlling, greater than that of the Portu- guese on the Tupi. If the Tupi has been forced to adopt mally Portuguese words and idioms, it is, as I llave shown, so flexible a language tllat it has admitted of the creatioIl of new words from already existing roots; but the Portuguese has been forced to adopt from the Tupi tlle names of almost all tlle plallts and animals of Brazil, and to a very large extent tlle geographical llames also. The plants and allimals of Brazil being entirely diXerent from tllose of Portugal, tl)e Portu- guese colonist on llis arrival in Soutll America fouzld himself witllout names for them, and since tlle Tupi names required but little change to fit tllem for admission into tlle Portu- guese vocabulary, th-ey were readily adopted. Many Portu- guese idioms llave crept into the Tupi; but, on the other hand, tlle Portuguese, as spoken on the Amazonas, besides containing a large admixture of Tupi words, is corrupted by many Tupi idioms. To illustrate more fully the structure of tlle Lingoa Geral, I have appended to tllis paper, with interli-sear trallslationsS one of tlle shortest of the myths I collected on the Amazonas. It was dictated to me by an Indian, and I have tried to report it exactly as spoken. The asard is a species of Ibis a beau- tiful bird extremely abuledant on the island of aMaraj6 or Fohannes, and distinguished by its brilliant red plumage. The karaup is a night-bird of the goat-sucker family and noted for its sombre plumage. The story relates how the ibis, fall- ing ill love with the red coat (eamix4) of the night-bird, borrowed it, osteilsibly to.attend a feast on tlle island of Maraj6, but he never returned witll it, lvherefore thc karavy still mourlls llis treachery, clad ill the sombre-hued goat of the ibis. Tlle mytllology of the Tupis was charactcrized by great siml)licity. If we may accept tlle testimony of early writers, they l)elieved in a sort of celestial deity, Tupdn; but ullder Portllguese influence the conceptios of this spirit 11as beell so</page><page sequence="16">On the Linyoa Gerat of the Amazonas 7-3 completely merged in that of the Christian God tllat I fear it is now impossible to disentangle alld rehabilitate the old myth. A demotl, Eurupart, has, i like manner, lzecome confused with tlle Semitic devil. Althotlt,ll usually anthropomorphic this last spirit sometimes appears as a tatasA yaavdra, half hog, half jaguar, a raving werewolf. Tlle Kurupfras are anthropo- morphic, male or female, troll-like, forest spirits, characterized by reversed feet, who appear suddenlv, like a flash, before the eyes of the bewildered wanderer in tlle forest, leading him astray, and perhaps to destruction. Tlley arzw geIlerally maleficent, but may occasionally do man a good turn, and mally myths describe how tlle Indian hulltel has received from them arrows that never missed their mark. Tlle Kuru- ptras are often fond of playing serivus )ractical jokes, but they may, however, be outwitted by luan, alld, in a story that finds its counterpart in the Norse tale of " Boots who ate a match with a Troll," a llunter induced olle to cut himself open and thus commit suicide !

I have, fol illstance, found among the Illdians of tlle AmazoIlas a story of a tortoise tllat outran a deer hy posting its relations, at short drstatlces apart, along tlle road over wllich tlle race was to be run a fable found also in Afiica and Siam! A great many otller fables are related of tlle tortoise; as, for instance, llow he laid a waoer with a big fisll that l-le could pull llim oll shore, and with a tapir tllat he could pull him down to tlle river, alld llow 11e gailled tlle waU,er by tyillg the two anitnals togetller by a lliana (sip6), each becomillg exhausted ill 11is endeavors to resist, as he thought, the effort of tlle tortoise.

The Mulldurucu language abounds in dull sounds, and is very difficult to pronounce. The word for JEre I will write raxd7 but the first letter represents a dull sound tllat swings, so to speak, through r, , %7 nd7 d, to t. If a native is com pelled to pronoullce the word slowly or distinctly, he may use the sotlnd represented 1)y any one of tllese letters or combina- tions. The collection and verification of a vocabulaly is, as may be imagined, exceedingly diEcult. Tllough widely diXerent from the Tupi, ancient or modern, I am satisfied tllat the Mundurtlcu belotlgs to tlle same famity.
