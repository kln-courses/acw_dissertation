<plain_text><page sequence="1">16 "SOLOMON ISLANDS ART: A BIBLIOGRAPHY" By Mary Newman This bibliography covers the Melanesian art styles of the Solomon Islands. Present day political boundaries of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate have been ignored so that while Bougainville has been included the Polynesian outliers have been excluded. The selection of papers for inclusion in a bibliography on art is often difficult because the dividing line between art and material culture is arbitrary. Further papers on material culture could have been included here although it was felt that they were beyond the immediate scope of the bibliography. The bibliography is divided into three sections. The first part includes books and papers with a wide scope although they have been reviewed here purely for their coverage of the Solomon Islands. Then follows a section which includes many historical references. Some ethnographies are referred to but because of their large number not all have been listed here. However many snippets of in formation on art and material culture can be found in such works. Finally, there is a subject index listing particular topics and their relevant authors.
