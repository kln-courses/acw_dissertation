<plain_text><page sequence="1">WENDY DONIGER o'FLAHERTY The Dream Narrative and the Indian Doctrine of Illusion One of the most enchanting and stimulating unsolved riddles is the paradox of the dream within the dream, or the dreamer dreamt.l In its broadest outlines, this is a theme that has intrigued philosophers and poets throughout the world. Plato pointed out that it was never possible, at any given moment, to prove "whether we are asleep and our thoughts are a dream, or whether we are awake and talking with each other in a waking condition."2 The idea that we might be characters in someone else's dream?more precisely, in God's dream?recurs in many of the footnotes to Plato, notably in Bishop Berkeley. In literature, we encounter this theme in Calderone (Life is a Dream) and in Lewis Carroll (as a satire on Berkeley).3 The more specific theme of the dream adventure?of the hero who undergoes apparently real experiences for years, but awakens to find that only a moment has passed?was elaborately developed in China and Japan, and occurs in Islamic and Spanish sources as well. Roger Caillois, who has collected many dream adventures of this type, notes some of its recurrent motifs: Someone, in a dream, wakes up?or rather believes that he has awakened, although he continues to dream?and now lies expecting another awakening, which this time may be real but may also be as illusionary as the first. In this way he will be transported from one dream to another, from one awakening to another, without ever being absolutely certain whether he has finally arrived at the true awakening, the one that will restore him to the world of reality. . . . Since, at every moment of the dream, the sleeper is unaware of the fact that he is dreaming, and is even convinced that he is awake, it is clear that there can never be a moment in which a person who believes, himself to be awake does not have to entertain the suspicion of a doubt that he might perhaps at that time actually be dreaming. This problem has benefited from a long and complex philosophical history.4 Closely related to the question of whether we are dreaming or being dreamt is the corollary question of whether we are dramatists or the characters in someone else's dramas. Shakespeare was drawn back to this riddle again and again, in plays dealing with the themes of dreams and illusions (such as The Tempest, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and A Winter's Tale), or employing the device of the play within the play (as in Hamlet and Henry ?V, Part /). More recently, the paradox has been taken up by surrealist artists like Rene Magritte and M. C. Escher, surrealist playwrights like Pirandello (with his characters in search of an author) and Tom Stoppard (with Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern Are 93</page><page sequence="2">94 WENDY DONIGER o'FLAHERTY Dead serving as a play within which we may view Shakespeare's already nested plays), and in the stories of Jorge Luis Borges5 and Mircea Eliade.6 When we look more closely at the distribution of this theme, we begin to see a pattern, a complex m?ndala that has India as its center. While Plato was expounding the idealism that we think of as Platonic, Indian sages were composing the even more idealistic Upanishads. The Chinese and Japanese stories were based on tales carried to the Far East by Indian Buddhists; and the Spanish stories were retellings of tales brought by Islamic traders from India. Moreover, whereas the story of the dreamer dreamt was regarded in the West primarily as an exotic delicacy, an appetizer to titillate the mind for a while before one got down to serious philosophizing, in India it was the main course, philosophically speaking; it was taken very seriously indeed, as an elusive clue to a real truth. As Caillois remarks of the dream adventure in European romantic literature, Very frequently the dream remains a fairy tale that is dispelled by the awakening and to which at times a cumbersome allegorical value is attributed; it has nothing in common with the intellectual complications of the Oriental dream. "It was only a dream," the sleeper cries out upon awakening, occasionally disappointed, occasionally relieved, all according to whether the dream gratified or oppressed him. It is never more than an illusion, which may have been pleasing or distressing, but which the opening of the eyelids suffices to send back into nothingness.7 In India, by contrast, the dream adventure often proves the very opposite point, the "nothingness" of the world that we see when we open our eyes, or the substantial reality of the dream itself. The most complex example of this genre of fiction that I know occurs in a Sanskrit text called the Yogavasishtha-maharamayana, composed in Kashmir in the ninth century of our era.8 This text is well loved by Indians; it has been translated into many of the vernacular Indian languages and has found its way into "anonymous" oral traditions.9 It is a curious blend of abstract, classical Indian philosophy and vivid, detailed Indian folklore, a kind o? Reader's Digest or Classic Comic version of the doctrine of illusion. In it, a philosophy that often seems hollowly inhuman comes to life when the narrative spells out its wildest implications. It is as if someone took the abstract concept, "The universe is unreal," and made it somehow anthropomorphic, producing a kind of teaching device to make us understand what it feels like to realize that everything is unreal. And, of course, it can't be done; in our hearts, we don't believe it. But the narrative allows us?nay, forces us?to imagine ourselves in a situation in which we must believe it, in which we must act out the paradox. The story is about two philosophical ideas: it is about the way the mind apprehends the world, and about the way the world is. More particularly, it is about the way the two problems are related, the way our minds affect the world, and the way the world exists in our minds. It is a kind of religious parable, but more than that, it is a metaparable, a parable about parables, for it is about storytelling, as well as an example of storytelling. It builds the philosophy into the story by placing a running commentary in the mouths of several of the central characters, and it builds our minds?the minds of us, the audience, as we listen to the tale?into the text by drawing us deeper and deeper</page><page sequence="3">THE DREAM NARRATIVE 95 into the tale within the tale. In this way it embodies, as well as talks about, the paradox of the author who is a character in someone else's story, the dreamer who is a figure in someone else's dream. "The Monk Who Met the People in His Dreams" Once upon a time there was a monk who was inclined to imagine things rather a lot. He would meditate and study all the time, and fast for days on end. One day this fancy came to him: "Just for fun, I will experience what happens to ordinary people." As soon as he had this idea, his thought somehow took the form of another man, and that man wished for an identity and a name, even though he was just made of thought. And by pure accident, as when a crow happens to be under a tree when a palm fruit falls from it and hits him, he thought, "I am Jivata." This dream man, Jivata, enjoyed himself for a long time in a town made in a dream. There he drank too much and fell into a heavy sleep, and in his dream he saw a Brahmin who read all day long. One day that Brahmin fell asleep, worn out from the day's work, but those daily activities were still alive within him, like a tree inside a seed, and so he saw himself, in a dream, as a prince. One day that prince fell asleep after a heavy meal, and in his dream he saw himself as a king who ruled many lands and indulged in every sort of luxury. One day that king fell asleep, having gorged himself on his every desire, and in his dream he saw himself as a celestial woman. That woman fell into a deep sleep in the languor that followed making love, and she saw herself as a doe with darting eyes. That doe one day fell asleep and dreamed that she was a clinging vine, because she had been accustomed to eating vines; for animals dream too, and they always remember what they have seen and heard. The vine saw herself as a bee, that used to buzz among the vines; the bee fell in love with a lotus in a lotus pond and became so intoxicated by the lotus sap he drank, that his wits became numb one day; and just then an elephant came to that pond and trampled the lotus, and the bee, still attached to the lotus, was crushed with it on the elephant's tusk. As the bee looked at the elephant, he saw himself as an elephant in rut. That elephant in rut fell into a deep pit and became the favorite elephant of a king. One day the elephant was cut to pieces by a sword in battle, and as he went to his final resting place, he saw a swarm of bees hovering over the sweet ichor that oozed from his temples, and so the elephant became a bee again. The b?e returned to the lotus pond and was trampled under the foot of an elephant, and just then he noticed a goose beside him in the pond, and so he became a goose. The goose moved through other births, other wombs, for a long time, until one day, when he was a goose in a flock of other geese, he realized that, being a goose, he was the same as the swan of Brahma, the Creator. Just as he had this thought, he was shot by a hunter and he died, and then he was born as the swan of Brahma. One day the swan saw the god Rudra, and he thought, with sudden certainty, "I am Rudra." Immediately that idea was reflected like an image in a mirror, and he took on the form of Rudra. This Rudra indulged in every pleasure that entered his mind, living in the palace of Rudra and attended by Rudra's servants. But the Rudra that he had become had a special power of knowledge, and in his mind he could see every single one of his former experiences. He was amazed by the hundred dreams he had had, and he said to</page><page sequence="4">96 WENDY DONIGER o'FLAHERTY himself, "How wonderful! This complicated illusion fools everyone; what is unreal seems to be real, like water in a desert that turns out to be a mirage. I am something that can be thought, and I have been thought. "There happened to be a soul that, by chance, became a monk in some universe, and he experienced what he had been thinking about: he became Jivata. But because Jivata admired Brahmins, he saw himself as a Brahmin; and since the Brahmin had thought about princes all the time, he became a prince. And since that prince was inclined to do things in order to run a kingdom, he became a king; and because the king was full of lust, he became a celestial woman. And that fickle woman was so jealous of the beautiful eyes of a doe that she became a doe; and the doe became a vine that she had noticed, and the vine saw herself as a bee that she had observed for a long time, and the bee was trampled under the feet of an elephant that he had seen, and he wandered in and out of a series of rebirths. At the end of the round of a hundred rebirths is Rudra, and I am Rudra, I am he, the one who stands in the flux of rebirths where everyone is fooled by his own mind. For my amusement, I will raise up all those creatures who are my own rebirths, and I will look at them, and by giving them the ability to look at the matter as it really is, I will make them unite into one." When Rudra had decided upon this, he went to that universe where the monk was sleeping in his monastery, like a corpse. Joining his mind to the monk's mind, Rudra woke him up; and then the monk realized the error he had made (in believing his life as Jivata to be real). And when the monk looked at Rudra, who was the monk himself and was also made of Jivata and the others, he was amazed, though one who was truly enlightened would not have found cause for amazement. Then Rudra and the monk went, the two of them together, to a certain place in a corner of the space of the mind where Jivata had been reborn, and then they saw him asleep, unconscious, still holding a sword in his hand: the corpse of Jivata. Joining their minds to his mind, they woke him up, and then, though they were one, they had three forms: Rudra and Jivata and the monk. Though they were awake, they did not seem to be awake; they were amazed, and yet not amazed, and they stood there in silence for a moment, like images painted in a picture. Then all three of them went through the sky to the place, echoing in the empty air, where the Brahmin had been reborn, and there they saw the Brahmin in his house, asleep, with his, wife, the Brahmin lady, clasping him around his neck. They joined their minds to his mind and woke him up, and they all stood there, overcome with amazement. Then they went to the place where the king had been reborn, and they awakened him with their mind, and then they wandered through the other rebirths until they reached the swan of Brahma. And at that moment they all united together and became Rudra, a hundred Rudras in one. Then they were all awakened by Rudra and they all rejoiced and looked upon one another's rebirths, seeing illusion for what it was. Then Rudra said, "Now go back to your own places and enjoy yourselves there with your families for awhile, and then come back to me. And at doomsday, all of us, the bands of creatures who are part of me, will go to the ultimate resting place." And Rudra vanished, and Jivata and the Brahmin and the others all went back to their own</page><page sequence="5">THE DREAM NARRATIVE 97 places with their own families, but after a while they will wear out their bodies and will unite again back in the world of Rudra, and they will be seen as stars in the sky (Yogavasishtha 6.1.62.1-31, 6.1.63.1-75, 6.1.64.1-8).10 * * * This story is a highly sophisticated variant of a much loved Indo-European folk motif, which includes the story of Chicken-Licken (who told Henny-Penny who told Foxy-Loxy . . . that the sky was falling) and The House That Jack Built. The theme also appears in European literature as the motif of "Magic: Man magically made to believe himself bishop, archbishop, and pope."11 But instead of piling up barnyard animals or clergymen, the Indian text piles up nested figments of the imagination. This extraordinary story speaks directly to us, here in America in 1982, even though it is part of a text that was composed in India more than a thousand years ago. It is, I think, possible for us to ask our own questions of this text, twentieth century American questions, but before we can do this, we must first try to understand, as well as we can, what questions the author meant us to ask of it. This task is greatly facilitated for us by the fact that many of these questions are written right into the text. The story of the monk's dream is narrated by the great sage Vasishtha to Prince Rama (the same Rama who is the hero of the great Indian epic, the Ramayand), and Rama asks Vasishtha a number of questions, many of them the very questions that would occur to an American first encountering this story?literal-minded, earthbound, rather flat footed questions, it would seem. Rama asked, "How did Jivata and the Brahmin and the other forms that the monk imagined become real? How can an object of the imagination be real?" Vasishtha said, "The reality of the imagination is only partial; do not take it for something entirely real. What isn't there, isn't there. Yet the true nature of what is seen in a dream or visualized by the imagination exists at all times. Everything exists in a corner of the mind . . . (6.1.64.6 13). A person sees a dream as if it were a hard thing, and then from that dream he falls back into another dream, and from that into yet another dream, and each time it appears hard and firm" (6.1.65.6-8). Then Rama asked, "What became of the hundred Rudras? Were they all Rudras, or weren't they? And how could a hundred minds be made from a single mind? How could they be made by that Rudra who was himself made in someone's dream?" Vasishtha replied, "The monk visualized a hundred bodies in a hundred dreams. But all those forms in the dream were, in fact, Rudra, a hundredfold Rudra. For those who have removed the veil from reality can imagine things so precisely that those mental perceptions are actually experienced. And because of the omnipresence of the universal soul, something that is experienced in a particular way and in a particular place by a mind with true understanding will actually come into existence in that way at that very place" (6.1.69.1-6). On the one hand, the text seems to say, all the things that we think are real are only parts of a dream?our dream, or someone's else's dream. On the other</page><page sequence="6">98 WENDY DONIGER o'FLAHERTY hand, there is a reality in dreams, for the things that we imagine or dream are reflections of some reality that does exist at all times and in all places, and happens to get into our minds "by accident," like the accident that makes the monk think that he is Jivata. In this view, mental images are reflections of an underlying reality; there was a Jivata, and the monk dreamt of him; it only remained then for Rudra to find the Jivata that the monk had dreamt of, and introduce the two of them. Though the monk dreamed of a hundred people, those people did exist as a part of the god Rudra. Yet the text also implies that the monk had the power to dream them into existence from his mind upward, all the way up the line from the monk to the swan to Rudra; and Rudra had the power to think them all into existence as part of himself, from his mind downward, all the way from the swan to the monk. The text tells us that all the people in the dream are part of Rudra, physically; and it also says that they are part of his mind, his dream. These are not contradictions. For Rudra to think of something is for him both to make it exist and to find that it has always existed. These two kinds of creation?"making" and "finding"?are the same, for in both cases, the mind imposes its idea upon the spirit/matter dough of reality, cutting it up like a cookie cutter, now into stars, now into hearts, now into elephants, now into swans. It makes them, and it finds them already there, like a sculptor (or a bricoleur) making new forms out of objets trouv?s.n Rudra's mind is the mold that stamps out images, all of which ultimately derive from him. He stamps this mold upon the spirit/matter continuum of the universe in such a way that it breaks up into the separate (or rather, apparently separate) consciousnesses of all of us. The images that he sketches in our minds were already there?in the continuum, and in our minds?but we cannot know them until his mind touches ours, until he "joins his mind to (our) mind." Finally, when we really know Rudra, the images vanish, and the continuum is seen as it really is?devoid of the fragments of individual figures. Then the background becomes the foreground. This philosophy is made explicit at many points throughout the text, often in the form of explanatory remarks made by the storyteller (Vasishtha) to clarify what he regards as difficult or important points in the narrative, or in response to questions. It is a philosophy well known in India from the time of the Upanishads, a millennium and a half before our text was composed. Yet it may not have been the predominant cultural assumption, the shared "common sense," in India at that time.13 This is, I think, evident from the text's repeated insistence that all the characters in the story were amazed to find that the lives they had taken for real were merely parts of someone else's dreams; or contrariwise, that people they had just dreamed about turned out to be real people they could talk to. They are amazed at both implications: the implication that their real lives are dreams and the implication that their dreams are real?or rather, as real as their waking lives. They had assumed, as we usually assume, that dreams are unreal and that lives are real. Even at the very end of the story, Rama cannot understand how the hundred Rudras could become real, and the commentator explains his quandary: Rama asked his question because he did not think it was possible that the matter could be as it seemed, and as it had just been said to be, as in the verse that stated, "He awakened the monk, joining mind to mind"?that</page><page sequence="7">THE DREAM NARRATIVE 99 is, he did not think that one could awaken the monk and the others by transferring consciousness from Rudra's mind, or that in that way Rudra could make a hundred people by making the monk have a hundred dreams. (Commentary on 6.1.69.4) Even Rudra himself is said to have been amazed by his realization that his hundred dreams had thought themselves to be real, though he then conquers his amazement and carefully puzzles it all out (6.1.63.6). It must be granted that the narrator's insistence on the "amazement" of the characters in the story is, in part, a literary device (one that is well known from Christian miracle tales) to emphasize the importance of the extraordinary event and to provide us with doubting fools, fall guys set up either to be converted or to provide a foil for those who are converted. Nevertheless, these "amazed" participants and bystanders must also represent the point of view that the narrator would have expected to find in at least some of his audience. One might argue that the experience of surprise at reality-switching is more common?and hence less surprising?in India than in the West, since their epistemological assumptions make it possible to cross the borders more easily and more often. Yet such a boundary is taken for granted, even in India.14 The fact that we too in the West experience "amazement" (or even disbelief) when we first hear this story is not, I think, irrelevant. In any case, we will read ourselves into any text that we read; not only may we ask our own questions of the text; we cannot help asking our own questions. But I would argue that it must have been extremely difficult, if not impossible, for anyone, anywhere, ever to have maintained the extreme form of the belief that the entire universe, including oneself, was totally unreal. Nor does this text, finally, ask its readers to believe this. The text presents us with a rather extreme philosophical doctrine?that there is no crucial difference, or perhaps, no recognizable or testable difference, between waking reality and dream images. Thus it states that "truly enlight ened people" would not have been amazed by the monk's experience. Then it gives us a number of people who are astonished when presented with evidence that this might be true. But the paradox does not rest there. Rama asks another set of questions that moves the dilemma onto another level altogether. When Vasishtha had finished speaking, Rama asked, "Is there such a monk? Search within yourself and tell me right away." Vasishtha said, "Tonight I will go into a deep trance and search the universe to find out if there is such a monk or not, and tomorrow morning I will tell you." When they assembled again on the next morning, Vasishtha said, "Rama, I searched for that monk for a long time yesterday, with the eye of knowledge, the eye of meditation. Hoping to see such a monk, I wandered through the seven continents, and over the mountains of the earth, but no matter how far I went, I could not find such a monk; for how could something from the realm of the mind be found outside it? But then, near dawn, once more I went north in my mind, to a glorious country named Jina, where there is a famous monastery built over an anthill. And in that monastery, in the corner of a hut, there was a monk named Far-sight (Dirghadrisha), who had been meditating for twenty-one nights. His own servants did not enter his firmly bolted house, for they feared they might</page><page sequence="8">100 WENDY DONIGER o'FLAHERTY disturb his meditation. In a former eon there was once another monk of this very sort, just as I described him, and this one today is a second. Then, just in play, I searched through other universes, and finally I found, in a universe in the corner of space in the future, another monk just like that, with the same powers. And even in this very assembly there are people who will someday have the very same experiences and take on such a form and do such things, when this illusion will cast its spell over them." Then Rama's father, Dasharatha, said to Vasishtha, "Greatest of sages, let me send my men to the hut of that monk to awaken him and bring him right back here." Vasishtha said, "Great king, the body of that monk no longer has the breath of life in it; it is dissolved with rot; it is no longer the vessel of a living creature. The soul of that monk has become the swan of Brahma; during his own lifetime he has been released and is no longer subject to rebirth. At the end of a month the monk's servants, longing to see him, will force open the bolts, and they will wash his body and throw it out. Since the monk himself has left that body and has gone somewhere else, how could anyone wake up that ruined corpse in the monastery?" (6.1.65.10-20; 6.1.66.1-28; 6.1.67.1-6) What are we to make of this epilogue? Rama's question begins to consider the possible reality not of the characters in the monk's dream, but of the monk himself?that is, the reality status of a character in a story told by Vasishtha. And in his response to Rama, Vasishtha jumps out of the frame of narration and into his own story, just as the monk jumps out of the frame of his dream to meet the people he dreams of?or perhaps, as Rudra jumps out of the frame of his divine mind to meet the thoughts in it. This adds a new dimension to the nested levels of the dream?for now we have Vasishtha "thinking" of Rudra who is "realizing" the monk who is "dreaming" of Jivata and the others. It also adds another figure, Vasishtha, to the list of those who are privileged to manipulate the strings of the puppets within the cosmic drama by giving physical form to their mental images. Vasishtha is at first skeptical of any possibility that his own mental constructs could be real; as he says to Rama, "No matter how far I went, I could not find such a monk; for how could something from the realm of the mind be found outside it?" (6.1.66.6) It would appear that, at this point at least, Vasishtha aligns himself with those who are "amazed" to find their mental creations coming to life. Yet he does go to look for the monk, nevertheless. By seeking the monk, Vasishtha acts out the idealistic assumptions of the text, assumptions that have already been challenged by the skepticism of Rama, whose doubts are at first echoed by Vasishtha himself. But Vasishtha finds the monk. By finding him, Vasishtha both discredits that skepticism and greatly strengthens and enhances the idealistic argument, for he demonstrates that not only dreams, but even works of artistic creation?the stories that we make up to prove a point?reflect some aspect of reality, one that most of us do not have the powers to prove as did Vasishtha. This is an important extension, for it implies that this reality is reflected not only in dreams?which we take to be real while dreaming, but which we retroactively define as unreal when we awaken?but even in stories that we take to be unreal from the very start. From the god's-eye view, all stories are true.</page><page sequence="9">THE DREAM NARRATIVE 101 Why did Vasishtha think he could find the monk, since the monk was merely a creature in a story he had told and, supposedly, made up himself? The commentary suggests that Rama might have wrestled with this problem before framing his question to Vasishtha: Rama was full of doubt and curiosity. He praised his guru and recognized the purpose of his instruction, but he said, "Search within yourself and ask yourself this question: 'Even though I imagined this monk and spoke about him in order to enlighten you, Rama, nevertheless did he actually come into existence somewhere?' For it is simply not possible that a person that you would talk about would not have some sort of true essence." (Commentary on 6.1.65.13) Rama was amazed by the tale of the monk's dream; that is, he shared to some extent our "common sense" intuition that dreams are not real. Yet Rama's question, and Vasishtha's implicit affirmative answer?for he does go to look for the monk?suggest that both of them were at least half-convinced of the real existence of the monk; that is, they shared to some extent the philosophy set forth in the text, in flagrant violation of their common sense. Their ambivalence is explicitly stated: they were amazed, and not amazed. They wanted to find out for sure, and so Vasishtha set out to test his hypothesis. Both Rama and Vasishtha felt that there was, in fact, a possibility that Vasishtha's mental creations might have a physical reality. This is the psychology of the text. (The fact that it never occurred to Vasishtha to go and look for the monk until Rama asked him to do so, and the brusqueness of his initial reply to Rama?"How could you expect to find . . ."?probably indicate Vasishtha's belief that it does not really matter at all if one finds the specific, "real" monk of the dream; Vasishtha's didactic point lies elsewhere. Nevertheless, to please Rama, he does go and look, and he is not at all "amazed" in the end to find that the monk does exist.) The monk's existence might be explained in at least two ways, correspond ing to Rudra's "finding" or "making" the figures in his dream. Each of these explanations carries with it a different implication about the nature of reality; together they provide an expression of the ontology of the text. The first, implicit in the commentator's gloss, is the possibility that certain people might have the power instinctively to "tune in" on some real, already existing physical phenomenon?a person, a life, a city?while apparently just imagining such a phenomenon in a spirit of pure play, or by pure chance. This is what Rama means when he says, "Whatever a person like3/0? (i.e., the great sage Vasishtha) would talk about," must have some sort of true essence: such a sage would instinctively make up something real, even when constructing a hypothetical case. Later, when Rama asks Vasishtha if the hundred Rudras were real, Vasishtha replies, "The hundred bodies that the monk saw in his dreams?all of that was just thought up for the sake of explanation, and so I did not talk about them (in detail)" (6.1.69.2). Though Vasishtha did not bother to invent all the details, the details were there; Vasishtha just told Rama there were a hundred Rudras, to make his pedagogic point. In the same way, the monk dreamed of Jivata and there was a Jivata, whom he later found with Rudra's help. The</page><page sequence="10">102 WENDY DONIGER o'FLAHERTY second explanation is one that the text has already dwelt upon at some length: certain people, of whom Vasishtha is apparently one, have the power of making their mental projections, their dreams, become real physical objects?objects that had not existed until the powerful dreamer dreamed them into reality. In the context of our story, these two explanations are mutually supportive, not contradictory. Thus when Dasharatha, the king, asks Vasishtha to bring the monk to court, Vasishtha gently points out the stupidity of the question, not on the basis of the argument that one could hardly expect to find the monk at all (the tentative and quickly disproved hypothesis with which Vasishtha had at first ridiculed Rama's question about the reality of the monk), but rather because the monk's body was so very real that it had, like all real bodies, eventually ceased to exist; that is, it had rotted away. The reality ofthat body is brought home to us by the great detail in which the situation at the monk's hut is described, his name, the barred door, the worried servants. (The Commentary [on 6.1.67.4] suggests that Vasishtha said to the king, "The monk had commanded his servants not to open the bolts of the house for a month, and even your ministers cannot awaken him.") If, then, the monk is real (either as a result of Vasishtha's creation of him or as the result of some former creation that Vasishtha instinctively recognized when he made up his story), how long has he been real? To put the question more broadly: Do the people in the monk's dream exist for just the one episode that Vasishtha tells us about, perhaps a few months of an adult life, and suddenly vanish when he wakes up or dies, or do they live entire lives, from birth to death, of which the monk witnesses only a brief fragment? Before we can answer this, we must try to decide whether this is a story about dreams or a story about rebirth. Certainly it is, at least in part, a story about rebirth. When we reach the point where Rudra begins to retrace his footsteps, as it were, he refers to the "flux of rebirth (samsara) in which one is deluded by one's own mind" and the "various wildernesses of rebirth" through which he has wandered (6.1.63.21). Rudra then goes from one universe to another to find the place where the rebirth (never the birth) of Jivata, the Brahmin, and so forth had taken place, or of even greater significance, had begun; and at the end, they all wander together in the grounds of other rebirths. For samsara primarily denotes the physical world in which creatures circulate through their repeated births and deaths. The figures at the beginning and the end of the chain of the monk's dream, directly inside the outer frame formed by the monk and Rudra, are a man named Jivata and a swan. Jivata (the only character in the dream who is given a proper name) is a derivative of jiva, the ordinary Sanskrit word used to denote the individual life or the transmigrating soul. The swan is an ancient Indian symbol for the soul, and more especially, for the returning soul, the transmigrating soul, based perhaps on the natural symbolism of the swan's migration. More particularly, the swan may symbolize the memory of past lives, as in a verse from a Sanskrit poem describing the moment when a princess came of age: When the time came for her to learn, all the knowledge from her former life came back to her, as the rows of swans come back to the Ganges in the autumn.15</page><page sequence="11">THE DREAM NARRATIVE 103 In another variant of the story of the dream of rebirth, a king who has become reborn as a woman meets a friend from his previous life as a king, who tells him, "Don't you remember your old friend? You and I, my dear, were two swans who lived together in the lake of the mind, until you left me to wander on earth. I created the illusion that made you think you were a man or a woman. Our true nature is as two swans." And when the swan of the mind was awakened by the other swan, he won back the memory that he had lost.16 In this text, the swans are explicitly identified with the individual soul and the universal soul, and explicitly said to be one and the same. In this sense, each of the levels within the monks' dream is a complete rebirth of a single soul that goes from Rudra to the monk to Jivata to the Brahmin and so forth, until it subsides back into Rudra again. This mechanism is clearly at work in the second half of the cycle, when the animals die and are reborn, presumably as young animals that grow up. On the other hand, it appears that the monk transfers his consciousness into an already existent Jivata, taking up Jivata's life in medias res, as it were, and Jivata joins consciousness with an already existent middle-aged Brahmin, and so forth. This mechanism would explain how all of them continued to exist when the monk awoke, and how they were able to meet and talk together when Rudra found them all. Once again, the text says both that the soul "makes" each new life (from birth to death) and that it "finds" its new lives (in midstream). There is one single soul, and there are a hundred different souls, and yet they are the same. We do not see the entire rebirth of each of the characters; none of them is born, and most do not die within the story. The monk falls into a deep trance; Jivata passes out in a drunken stupor; the Brahmin falls asleep after a hard days' reading; the king and the celestial harlot are exhausted by pleasure; and so forth. These people dream and become what they have habitually dreamt about. Yet, near the end of the chain, some of the animals do seem to die and become what they happen to see at the moment of death: the bee is pulverized on the tusk of an elephant; the elephant is cut to pieces by a sword; the bee is trampled by another elephant. The elephant is actually (if euphemistically) said to have died, and the others experience violent accidents. The penultimate transition is explicitly said to be a death: the goose dies, shot by a hunter, and becomes the swan of Brahma. The swan then experiences the final and most subtle transition: as soon as he realizes that he is Rudra, his idea is instantly reflected like an image in a mirror?that is, it is projected outside of himself and becomes a solid figure, or if you prefer, it becomes reflected in the already existing figure of Rudra himself. The swan then takes the form of Rudra and abandons his (swan) body, just as the scent of a cluster of blossoms leaves the blossoms behind and is wafted away on the wind (6.1.63.1-3). It would appear that the figures are arranged in a kind of hierarchy, and that the higher consciousnesses merely dream of a partial rebirth, while the lower ones must actually die, must endure physically what the others have merely experienced mentally. Setting aside for the moment the monk, as a special case to which we will return, we can see that the characters form three groups that steadily descend in metaphysical acuity (Figure 1). Jivata is defined as an ordinary sort of man who loves life; hence he is the logical starting point for an Odyssey that is designed to dramatize for ordinary people (the ones who are</page><page sequence="12">Figure 1. The Strange Loop of the Dream Within the Dream "amazed" when the dividing line between dream and reality melts away) the doctrines of illusion and rebirth. He is, moreover, the random sample, the man in the street; the monk thinks of him "by pure chance" (6.1.62.7). Jivata is the literal embodiment of the transmigrating soul?of Everyman. Paired with Jivata, we encounter the highest human type: the learned Brahmin. In another story told by this same text, the tale of the Brahmin Gadhi, it is the Brahmin, not the monk, who is the pivotal figure, the dreamer of the outermost dream, but he experiences the dream helplessly, although with understanding.17 In this tale of the monk's dream, by contrast, the outermost dreamer (the monk) actively sets out to produce the dream experience and to materialize it; and this activity, as we shall see, is proper only to perfected monks, not to ordinary Brahmins. Thus the Brahmin and Jivata are rightly paired as puppets, rather than puppeteers, in this particular episode. (There is, of course, one other Brahmin in the story?Vasishtha?but his role is even more peculiar than that of the monk, and we must postpone for the moment an analysis of his status in</page><page sequence="13">THE DREAM NARRATIVE 105 the hierarchy.) After the Brahmin come the prince and the king. The royal image is divided into two, of which the first is lower than the second, as was the case with our first pair. Below the king is a triad of females who form the transition from higher to lower consciousness, one semidivine (the celestial woman), one animal (the doe), and one vegetable (the vine). These three figures are still part of the higher echelon who dream rather than die, and who become what they have always known, not what they see as they die. The text tells us that animals do dream. So too is the vine conscious; she is said to see in herself the embodiment of the loveliness that had been asleep and numb inside the doe for a long time (6.1.63.19; 6.1.62.20-21). The vine is the incarnation of the metaphor of female beauty (graceful women are always like clinging vines in Sanskrit poetry), even as Jivata is the embodiment of the soul. The next quartet, like the first, is divided into two pairs. The elephant and the bee are animals closely associated with violence and eroticism; the wildness of the male elephant in rut carries fairly obvious symbolic meaning, and bees in Indian love poetry are said to form the bowstring of the god of lust, and to plunge deep inside the flowers that ooze with sap even as the elephant's temples ooze with ichor. In our text, the bee perishes because his lust for the lotus stupefies him and makes him stick to her even in death (6.1.62.22-6). The bee and the elephant find violent deaths, over and over again. Then we encounter the last pair, the goose who becomes a swan. Here the hierarchy doubles back on itself; the lowest becomes the highest, and the swan becomes the god, Rudra. The true break comes within this pair: the goose has to be shot dead to become the swan, the only explicit death in the story and the most violent transition, but the swan merely "reflects" itself into Rudra, the least violent transition. Once we have reached the swan, we are home. At this point, there is no more dreaming; now we begin to unravel all that has been dreamt. The creatures in the monk's dream form a pattern that is a masterful combination of order and chance. They are distributed to cover the full spectrum of consciousness, a point that the text emphasizes by its overall groupings: human males, nonhuman females, and male animals and insects. These groups are, I think, meant to depict a steady general decline. Yet within each group are upswings?Jivata moves up when he becomes a Brahmin or a prince; the bee improves his lot when he becomes an elephant; and the goose becomes a very special swan. Moreover, there are switchbacks (the elephant who relapses into beehood), redundancies (several bees), and finally a catchall group of "etceteras" at the end. These irregularities convey the richness and randomness of the process of reincarnation. This random variation also characterizes the pattern through which all of us will, at some time before the end of infinity, become incarnate as that same monk, in much the same way as the monkey playing at his typewriter will eventually compose the complete works of Shakespeare. Yet, although anything can happen, certain things are more likely to happen; this is the way that karma skews and orders the chaos of the universe. As the same dream gets into different peoples' heads?in this case, the dream of the monk who meets the people in his dreams?there may be minor variations on the theme, minor changes in the manifestations of the archetype: "Again and again these lives</page><page sequence="14">106 WENDY DONIGER o'FLAHERTY revolve in creation like the waves in water, and some (rebirths) are strikingly similar (to what they were before), and others are about half the same; some are a little bit the same, some are not very much alike at all, and sometimes they are once again just the same" (6.1.66.22-4). This flexibility, together with the elements of pure chance and the gravity of karmic tendencies, make certain coincidences not only possible, but probable. Midway through the round of rebirths, the text moves from dreams to deaths, and then begins to talk of them simultaneously, using the two images to illuminate one another: death is like a dream (or, rather, like an awakening), and a dream or an illusion is experienced as a kind of death. We "awaken" from ignorance, or from sleep, or from life; the same verb covers all three. Ultimately, the contrast between creatures who dream and creatures who die is exposed as being as meaningless as the contrast between one transmigrating soul or a hundred dreamt souls. Illusion and rebirth melt together from the very start, in the short poem with which the commentary introduces the whole story: "The story of Jivata is about the way in which people wrongly perceive that they have obtained various bodies; such a wrong perception operated in the mind of the monk as a result of his various karmic memory traces (vasanas)" (Introduction to 6.1.62.1) For this is not just a story about rebirth, it is a story about karma. What are these karmic memory traces? In classical Indian philosophy, on which our text constantly draws, they are the bits of experience that adhere to the transmigrating soul and that predispose it to act in one way or another in its new life; they may also be experienced as inexplicable, tantalizing memories, the uneasy aftermath of a dream that has been forgotten by the conscious mind but that continues to haunt the deeper mind?the subconscious or unconscious mind, as the Freudians and Jungians would term it. It was the karmic memory traces that kept alive the knowledge that returned to the princess when she came of age, like swans returning to the Ganges in autumn. Our text tells us, for example, that after the bee had become an elephant and was then reborn as a bee, he went back to the same lotus pond where he had previously met with his unfortunate accident, "because people who are not aware of their karmic traces find it hard to give up their bad habits" (6.1.62.32). So too, when the beautiful woman becomes a doe because she envies the beauty of the doe's eyes, Rudra remarks, "Alas, the delusion that results from the karmic traces causes such misery among creatures" (6.1.63.17). All of the people in the dream-chain are reborn in a particular form because they want something. There is a hunger left unsated in their present lives, and this propels them across the barrier of death into a new birth, where that still unfulfilled longing leads them to do what they do. The link between dream illusions and the compulsions that make us fall again and again into the trap of rebirth is carefully forged by our text: One's own soul, making separate what is in fact a unity, becomes fragmented in rebirths; every single creature dies and experiences, as a separate existence, a life that is like a dream. It is not only the monk whose soul quickens from a previous life; our own living souls go from one delusion to another delusion, every day. Just as a cloud, that seems hard as a rock, is shattered on the tip of a mountain, so the living soul is shattered upon the Supreme Soul (6.1.65.3-7).</page><page sequence="15">THE DREAM NARRATIVE 107 The one thing that is real?firm and hard?is the universal soul, the Godhead. The experience of the individual soul, by contrast, is entirely soft, a cloud of karmic traces. The individual soul is a dream, but there is something firm in the universe, something real?the universal soul of which each living soul is a fragment. The monk is the one who understands this. He is free from the unfulfilled longings that animate the creatures of his dreams. The monk, at the top of the human hierarchy, is the point at which the dream and the rebirth converge and diverge. Rudra says that the monk was a soul that by chance became a monk; when Rudra returns to find the monk and awaken him (in the main story, before the epilogue), the monk is asleep as if he were a corpse; he is the dreaming soul. In the epilogue, however, when Vasishtha goes inside the story himself to find the monk, he finds only a dead body: the soul has escaped and gone back to Rudra, and the monk is nothing but a corpse. Thus the monk is the soul that seems to be born and die, though the soul is, in fact, merely dreaming, and being dreamt. The monk's story acts out the basic metaphor of the text: that what seems to be life and death is merely a dream and an awakening. The monk's involvement in rebirth is different from that of all the other characters in Vasishtha's story (or within the monk's dream). The text insists that the monk himself was born purely "by chance" (6.1.63.9), and that he in turn became Jivata "by accident" (6.1.62.7). That is, the monk did not become reborn to quench a thirst, but merely dreamed of another life out of pure intellectual curiosity. He becomes Jivata merely "in play," or "for amusement" (lilartham, 6.1.62.5), the word for purposeless sport being the same as the one used in classical philosophical texts to describe why it is that God, who has no desires, bothers to make the universe at all. Rudra repeats that the monk indulged in pure play when he imagined Jivata (6.1.63.10-11), and it is this same spirit of pure play that leads Rudra himself to decide to travel through the universes to wake up all the figures in the monk's dream (6.1.63.36). This is what sets the monk apart from all the others: he alone can control his mental imaging, which means both that he is not forced, willy-nilly, to become what he does not want to be (or for that matter, what he wants to be), and also that he can project his own mental images onto other minds or onto the fabric of reality itself. The text takes pains to tell us about this: it was the purity of his mind, and the powers developed in meditation, that gave him the ability to become whatever he thought of; that is, he emptied his mind of all but the one thing he wanted to become, so that he was nothing but that thought. The commentator is even more specific about the monk's powers: in the manner of ascetics (yatis), he assumed the form of another man (Commentary on 6.1.62.6), for yogis can enter other peoples' real, existing bodies. This is a common motif in Indian folk tales. Yet the monk is caught up, like the others, in his own imaginings; like them, he is astonished when brought face to face with the people in his dreams, and Rudra says that the monk became Jivata because of his still decaying karmic memory traces (6.1. 63.13). He experiences precisely what they all experience, even though, unlike them, he sets out to do it on purpose. Thus the introductory verse tells us that the monk was the victim of a mistaken perception (vibhrama) (on 6.1.62.1), for he took the people in his dream to be real and he did not, on the other hand, realize at first that he was merely part of</page><page sequence="16">108 WENDY DONIGER o'FLAHERTY Rudra's dream. As soon as he wished to become someone else, his mind lost its calm, like an ocean stirred by a whirlpool (6.1.62.6). When Rudra replays the story in his own mind, he says that the monk's form changed because of the emotion that moved him at the time (6.1.63.10). Rama is puzzled by this problem, and asks Vasishtha how a monk of such spiritual distinction could be caught up in the web of delusion (6.1.65.12). Vasishtha does not answer this question specifically, but the subsequent analysis makes it clear that the monk's great degree of mental control, though temporarily swept aside by the intensity of the dream, reasserted itself, so that the monk could realize the dream of Rudra, could become awakened. Thus the commentator introduces the last chapter with this verse: "In this chapter, the body of the monk is destroyed when he has been released through his meditation, and just as the monk was first bound by and then released from his false perception, so, too, other people become bound and are released at their own awakenings." (Commentary on 6.1.67.1) The monk is part of the chain gang of rebirth, like all the rest of us, but he is first in line, and this text describes the moment when he breaks out, to set an example for all of us. For at the end of the story, the monk is described as one who has become released from the wheel of rebirth during his lifetime (6.1.67.6). The monk is a Buddhist monk; he lives in a Buddhist monastery in a northern country called Jina, perhaps China. He is thus probably a Tibetan monk or some other sort of Mahay ana monk?which is to say, a shaman and a magician. The power that he has is one that is shared by Hindu yogis as well: "By their own powers over time and space, yogis and female yogis here can stand somewhere else, wherever they wish" (6.1.64.28). The text lists other people from the annals of Hindu mythology who have had similar powers: While Vishnu remained asleep in the ocean of milk, he was born as a man on earth (Krishna); while Indra remains on his throne in heaven, he goes down to earth to receive the sacrifice; though Krishna was only one person, he became a thousand for the many kings who are his devotees, and for the thousands of women who were his mistresses, by indulging in the game (lila) of partial incarnation. In this same way, through the power of the understanding of Rudra, Jivata and the Brahmin and all the others who had been imagined by the monk went to whatever city they had imagined (6.1.66.29-34). Even ordinary people become what they concentrate on, volens nolens; this is the power that drives the machine of rebirth. Extraordinary people, however, can do this on purpose, and without dying. Vishnu, Indra, Krishna, and Rudra are gods; the imaginings of gods are a thousandfold more powerful than the imaginings of yogis and monks. And Rudra (in this text, at least) is both the supreme god and the supreme yogi. Rudra is the warp upon which we all weave our dreams; he is the fluid in which we all flow together like the particles in a suspension. He is the place where we all meet in our dreams, the infinity where our parallel lives converge. The text tells us that the lives the monk imagined could not see one another,</page><page sequence="17">THE DREAM NARRATIVE 109 living as they did in separate universes, except through the knowledge of Rudra (6.1.64.21). This last phrase is, I think, purposely ambiguous: it means that only people who know Rudra?in particular, who know that they are Rudra? can meet the people of their dreams (or meet the people that they were in their former lives and will be in their future lives). But it also means that only through the fact that Rudra knows them can they hope to bridge the gap between the apparently separate souls; that Rudra will show them that they are one another, because they are he. For though, as Rama points out, Rudra is merely a character in someone's dream?the monk's dream, at first, and the swan's dream, at last (6.1.69.4)?he is also the dreamer of all dreams, including the dream of the one who dreams him, the dream of the monk. Thus when the text says that Jivata lives in a universe in a corner of the mind (6.1.63.41), the immediate meaning is that it is a corner of the mind of the monk. But as the tale unfolds we come to understand that the monk himself exists only in the corner of another mind, Rudra's mind. Moreover, where the monk merely dreams of Rudra, Rudra produces the monk in a more direct fashion: the monk is a partial incarnation of Rudra, an atom flowing in the veins of Rudra. Rudra is "made of Jivata and the others, the text says. Thus our story takes place on three levels of thought that are also three levels of existence. We begin on the most obvious level, with our assumption that dreams are basically different from reality; on this level animals actually change from one form to another when they die. Mind and matter are distinct; though they may interact and influence one another, they are made of different stuff. On the middle level, we encounter the possibility of transforming mind into matter and matter into mind; here is the level where people dream, or think, about assuming another form, and so assume it. This middle level has two subdivisions: truly enlightened people, who understand that mind and matter are not essentially different things, may intentionally use their minds to bring about a change in the forms of matter?or rather, an apparent change; while those who are not truly enlightened are forced to undergo what they think to be real changes of form, though these changes too are merely apparent. Finally, on the highest level, we find the undifferentiated substance that always is both mind and matter, that underlies both the apparent changes of material form and the less obvious transmutations that mental forces exert upon apparent matter. On this level, we realize that nothing ever changes into anything else, that everything was there all along, and everything was, for want of a better word, God all along. Despite Rudra's extraordinary ontological status, his actual mental processes are flawed like those of even the best of his dream creatures, the monk. The monk, who unknowingly imitates Rudra's "play" (lila), begins dispassionately enough, but as soon as he imagines a person with passions (the earthy Jivata), he is caught up in those passions himself, forced to follow the game into realms he had not intended to explore. So too Rudra is caught up in his own sport; he is "amazed" to see what creatures people the brave new world of his imagination. He too has karmic residues?more than anyone else, since he experiences everyone's lives.18 Though he is the mold that cuts the forms, those forms also create themselves, beyond his control, once the process is set in motion. Like the monk, Rudra discovers that creation inevitably leads to imperfection, to the</page><page sequence="18">110 WENDY DONIGER o'FLAHERTY self-perpetuating desire to go on creating. Like the monk, Rudra indulges his frivolity, his creative urge. Even Rudra, then, is not a true model of freedom from karma; not even Rudra can remain deaf to the songs of the sirens he imagines. For "pure" play does not remain pure for long. When Rudra acts "for the sake of play/sport/amusement/fun," or "for the sheer hell of it" (lilartham), we might also translate the term, "art for art's sake." This same "art" is implicit in the word usually translated as "illusion," maya, which may be related to the Sanskrit verb "to make" (ma). Maya is what Rudra "makes" (or "finds") when he imagines the universe; maya is his art. To say that the universe is an illusion is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. Similar concepts cluster together in English around the derivatives of the Latin word for play {ludo, as in delusion, illusion, and so forth) and around the word "play" itself (play as drama, as swordplay, as the play of light that causes mirages, as the ambiguity and double image implicit in wordplay).19 These word clusters delineate a universe full of beauty and motion that enchants us all. Yet maya is often associated with evil in Indian texts, for it is the trick of the mind that causes us to become, literally, deadly serious about what begins in a spirit of play. Maya is what makes us dream, and die. Caillois concludes his essay with a speculation about the playfulness of the dream of God, from a Western point of view: The most rugged of theologians, in every period and of every persuasion, those who have dared to venture to the brink of the dizzy precipice of metaphysics, those who are mathematically cool and precise, have all agreed in assuming (one might say unanimously) that the relation between God and the world is like that which an all-powerful Spirit?a spirit that has no need to use its power, that scorns to impose its will, absentminded, impish, overgenerous?has with its Dream (solely through an excess of excellence), without even being aware of it. The Dream is the unfathomable, the inscrutable Universe that He lets emanate from Himself, a heedless and needless fantasy, perhaps.20 India provides a challenge to the "unanimity" of this theological view, for it sees the dream of Rudra as one that he becomes aware of, and one that is not "needless" once it has begun, though it might have been needless at the very beginning of the game. If Rudra is thus caught in his own coils, is there no one who is impervious, safe, out of bounds? There seems to be one: Vasishtha. Like the monk and Rudra, he is able to make his dreams come true, and not merely his dreams, but even his conscious didactic examples. Moreover, Vasishtha is not amazed at the things that happen in his story, not even at the fact that his story turns out to be true. He creates not out of idle curiosity or even a spirit of playfulness, but to teach Rama a lesson. Unlike the Brahmin in the monk's dream, who, although a Brahmin, was not a particularly subtle theologian or accomplished sage, Vasishtha knows all the answers; he alone never seems to be fooled. Vasishtha is the key to the paradox of the dreamer dreamt. The tale of the monk involved us in what Douglas Hofstadter has called a Strange Loop or a Tangled Hierarchy.21 Each dream seems to be nested inside another, until, when we encounter the final, innermost dream, it is identified with the</page><page sequence="19">THE DREAM NARRATIVE 111 outermost dream: Rudra is the monk who is dreaming about Rudra. What we thought was a spiral turns out to be a kind of Moebius strip, which bends in on itself forever. This bothers Rama: "How could a hundred Rudras be made by Rudra who was himself made in someone's dream?" Tangled hierarchies of this sort abound in logic, as a special kind of paradox of which perhaps the most famous is the self-referential paradox of Epimenides, the Cretan who stated, "All Cretans are liars." Lewis Carroll, who was fascinated by paradoxes of this sort, dramatized the same one that animated the tale of the monk's dream: Alice dreams that the Red King dreams of her. In visual form, such tangled hierarchies appear in the etchings of Escher, such as "Drawing Hands": a hand draws a picture of a hand that draws the first hand.22 In literature and art, these paradoxes can be "solved," if one cheats by stepping back out of the frame altogether, to what Hofstadter calls the "inviolate level." The answer to Lewis Carroll's question, "Who dreamed the dream?" is, "Lewis Carroll," and it is Escher who drew the hands. In our Hindu myth, we are tempted to step back in rhythm with all the other characters who leap from frame to frame: we move from Rudra who is dreamt by the swan (who is dreamt by the goose . . . who is dreamt by Jivata) to the monk who is imagined by Vasishtha who is a character in a book (the Yogavasishtha) that is attributed to the poet Valmiki, whose work has been translated into English by me and is now being read by someone in Daedalus. When we reach Vasishtha, we think we have reached the inviolate level?but this turns out to be only the first of several such levels. I began this analysis by likening the story of the man who met the people in his dreams to the stories of Henny-Penny and The House That Jack Built. These are cumulative tales, and indeed, that is what our story seems to be at first, up to the point where we end up with all the characters crowded together. But as we look deeper, we see that the structure is not linear but concentric, that the tale is not cumulative, but nested, with causative, interlocking links that must be unraveled, not merely unpiled.23 So too we can at first depict the line of transmission on the "inviolate" level as a straight line: Vasishtha to Valmiki (in a manner parallel to the transmission from Socrates to Plato) to O'Flaherty to Daedalus reader. But one of the things that the story teaches us is that the frame can always pull back from what seems its natural resting place to reveal yet another level within which it is nested. And finally, we must consider the possibility that that outer level is in fact identical with one of the levels that we had considered to be inside, or farther down the linear sequence. If we apply this twist to the "inviolate" line of transmission, we must draw at least a dotted line from our putative ultimate point (the Daedalus reader) back to Rudra (Figure 1), implying that Rudra is dreaming of us, the readers. We may avoid being tricked into accepting the involuted twist in Vasishtha's story, the moment when the monk leads us back to Rudra, back once more into the secret heart of the labyrinth from which the characters in the story can never escape. But have we escaped after all? I think not. Vasishtha experiences doubts about the monk's nonexistence, and so he cannot resist acting in his own play, just like the monk and Rudra. Authors are caught up in their stories; and so are readers. If Vasishtha can plunge into the page and come face to face with the monk in his own story, as Rudra can go into his dream and wake up the people who are dreaming him, we cannot rest confident in our assumption that our</page><page sequence="20">112 WENDY DONIGER o'FLAHERTY level of the story is the final "inviolate" level. If there is one inviolate level, it is the level of the Godhead, the impersonal continuum beyond even Rudra. This is the level of the universal soul, the source of all mental images that assume material form. For though monks and great sages and poets and gods can project themselves into physical bodies whenever they want to, all of us?princes and harlots and bees and professors?helplessly spin, out of our desires, the lives that we have inherited from our former selves. Sooner or later, our dreams do become real, whether we want them to or not, whether they are nightmares or wishes that we long to have fulfilled. The difference between most of us and Indian sages like Vasishtha is that we are unaware of our dreams, unaware of our repeated lives, or rather, unwilling to accept the disquieting, but challenging, possibility that the former lives and dreams may be as real, or unreal, as our waking experiences and thoughts.

A variant of one of the tales from the Yogavasishtha was recorded by John Hinton Knowles in Kashmir in 1893; another variant of the same tale was told to me in August 1980, in Mysore, by Mrs. Lalita Handoo, who heard it from her great-aunt in Kashmir. 10All subsequent parenthetical citations are from this source. nStith Thompson, Motif Index of Folk Literature, revised edition, 6 volumes, (Bloomington, Indiana: 1955-58), motif D 2041.5, volume 2, p. 308. 12For the construction of lives as bricolage, see my essay "Inside and Outside the Mouth of God: The Boundary between Myth and Reality," which appeared in the Spring 1980 issue of Daedalus, pp. 93-125. 13For the argument that common sense is a cultural construct that differs in different times and places, see "Common Sense as a Cultural System" by Clifford Geertz, which appeared in Antioch Review, volume 33, 1975, pp. 5-26. 14I am indebted to David Shulman for the formulation of this paragraph, and to A.
