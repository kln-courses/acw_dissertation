<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Symbolism and Ritual Context of the Yoruba Laba Shango JOAN WESCOTT &amp; PETER MORTON-WILLIAMS THE ETHNOGRAPHER HAS OFTEN TO FACE THE PROBLEM of interpreting symbols or sym- bolic acts which, within their culture, exist without a sanctioning explanation. He must consequently decipher and explain discursively what the native intuitively perceives and responds to. In seeking to discover what significance such a symbol has, we must find first how the form is set in its institutional context; and second, how it is integrated into the religious, moral, and motivational systems within the society. In this analysis we have interpreted a symbol for which the Yoruba can offer no explanation; we have therefore tried to introduce the Yoruba consciousness much as Griaule did with the Dogon culture, and Evans-Pritchard with those of the Azande and Nuer. In a purely structural-functional type of analysis interpretation is, in contrast, limited by such direct references as can be made to the model; there the anthropologist too often assumes that the symbol can simply be interpreted reductively as having referents in his constructed pattern of social relations. In this elucidation of a complex non-verbal symbol, our inter- pretations explore a wider range of meaning, but these interpretations nevertheless may be referred to evidence that can be judged by objective criteria. Weight is added to our interpretation of the symbol under discussion by showing that its elements are given explicit meaning in other contexts such as myths, praise songs, and ritual sculpture. The symbol that concerns us here (Plates I and II) is one which decorates the laba, a flat red leather bag about twenty inches square which is part of the equipment of every priest of Shango, the thunder god of the Yoruba of south-west Nigeria.' Covering the face of the laba are the four identical symbolic panel designs for which we could elicit no verbal explanation. The bag itself is used to contain ritual objects, and is carried by the priests when purifying a spot where lightning has struck and, also, when in full panoply they join the procession of the priesthood at the main annual rite of the god.2 For the Shango devotees, the bag has symbolic value, and it seems from discussions with them that its significance lies mostly in its decorated panels. But their meaning is not perceived in rational terms, and the worshippers were only able to describe its use; they could not interpret the decoration as a whole or by parts in terms of any of their ex- planatory systems. Shango worshippers are particularly averse to intellectual approaches and their ritual symbolic forms are often preserved without explanation and even with- out a myth supporting their meaning. We are here attempting to discover by conceptual and aesthetic analysis what the panel design directly conveys to the Yoruba as a symboJ. The analysis is to be founded upon the aesthetic content of the laba, on its place in the rites of Shango, and on the resemblance of its decorative elements to those that, when found elsewhere in Yoruba 23</page><page sequence="2">24 JOAN WESCOTT &amp; PETER MORTON-WILLIAMS religion and religious art, have explanations of a kind we can interpret satisfactorily. Concluding, we shall relate the configuration formed by the combination of structural and decorative elements to the ritual use of the bag. As we shall show, this method can be applied just as rigorously as the methods of history and structural-functionalism; prolonged study of Yoruba symbols and of their functioning in their culture has con- vinced us that to understand them and to convey the underlying religious conceptions, these two analytic techniques must be supplemented. But before we can go on to the analysis, we shall have to set forth the ethnography of the laba in some detail. While we were in the Yoruba metropolis Oyo, we persuaded the High Priest of the Shango cult (the Magba) to allow us to have a laba made. It is now in the British Museum. The laba, made up of goatskin dyed in traditional red, consists of a pouch, a flap that hangs over the opening of the pouch covering its front, and a long strap which enables the laba to be worn down one side of the body while the strap passes over the opposite shoulder. Along the bottom edge of the flap are seven tassels, each a triangle with bundles of leather strips hanging from them. Except for the narrow vertical design often seen along each side of the front face of the pouch, only the flap is decorated. The elements of the decoration are four intricate panels on a ground of red cloth. Each of the four panels carries the same design, and it is substantially the same on every laba made in Oyo.3 Not only the Magba and his two deputies, but other Shango priests and wor- shippers as well, have asserted that every laba must bear this design ;4 and it is this design, traditionally repeated in each of the four panels, that contains the ritual mean- ing of the laba and has provoked the writing of this paper. The panel design itself, together with its border, is nmade up of cut-out yellow leather, embroidered with narrow strips of black and white leather, and is stitched over a red felt background. Four irregularly shaped green leather pieces mark the corners as part of the background for the central yellow motif; two leather shapes interrupt the red felt background forming a diagonal of black behind the yellow design5 (Fig. opp. Plate I). Decorated leather work is a long established craft in Oyo, and, like most crafts there, it is confined to certain lineages. The leather workers of to-day are members of one or other of three lineage groups that are segments of a lineage formerly in Old Oyo. Only one of these segments, the Otun Shona,6 literally, 'the right (hand group of) leather workers,' is authorized to make laba, and then, only to the order of the Magba. The mem- bers of this lineage group regard the making of laba as so important a task that it is closely supervised and in part done by only the most skilled and senior members among them. A newly made laba is sealed before it is delivered to the Magba, the two faces of the pocket being glued together with starch paste. The Magba alone is permitted to open it, and the unsealing is done in secret in the privacy of his shrine. While opening the one we commissioned, he worked into the sealed leather a solution of water, palm oil, and some magic black powder, of which the composition was not disclosed. He asserted that the leather would tear if anyone else attempted to unseal the bag, or if he himself neglected to use the powder. When the outside of the pocket had been saturated and softened by the mixture, he worked the solution into the pocket, gradually separating the faces. The operation was an arduous one, taking about twenty minutes and causing him to sweat profusely. Physical exertion is so rarely required of a high priest that its occurrence here points to the ritual importance of the operation.7</page><page sequence="3">THE YORUBA LABA SHANGO 25 As a sign of acceptance into the Shango cult, a new priest is required to have his own laba made. But he does not deal directly with the makers, as he does with the wood- carvers when he needs a dance staff. The Magba must commission it for him, and re- ceive payment on behalf of the craftsmen. While every new priest is expected to obtain his first laba in this way, some may later purchase others to display in their shrines. These supernumerary ones need not be opened. The laba is worn when the priest travels in his vestments to officiate at some rite away from his shrine. It is never worn while the priest is in a state of possession, when he then is dressed as the god. When they are not carried, laba hang in the domestic shrines (gbongon) of the Shango priests (Plate II A) and are used to contain only 'thunderbolts' (edun ara),8 i.e. neolithic celts, and the sacred gourd rattles (shere), which are shaken while prayers are addressed to Shango. They are never used to carry the double-axe dance staffs (oshe), which are used only in a state of possession.9 The Shango cult, compared with other Yoruba cults, is remarkable for its elaborate ritual, and the abundance and variety of its sculpture and symbols. Yet its body of myth concerning the ritual objects is particularly meagre. The myths are, for the most part, confined to stories of Shango and are concerned with his life as a king, his death and re-emergence as a god, and his relations with other gods and with mankind.10 It appears that in so restricting the subject matter of his myths, the Shango worshipper ensures that when, he contemplates his ritual object, the rational functions of his mind are silenced; as fully as he may he opens himself to emotions liberated by the visual and intuitive experience of these forms. Thus it seems to us that he is consistent in demanding that the mystery surrounding his ritual objects be preserved so that he may respond to them fully on an emotional level; an explanation would limit or vitiate their evocative power as symbols. It is especially to be noted that neither of the two most important symbolic objects in the Shango cult-the thunder-axe (oshe) and the laba-are given any explanation. The former is carried during the violent, frenzied possession, the latter on ritually sanctioned plundering expeditions. The violence of the typical Shango possession and the plundering of the priests are both in conflict with normal Yoruba rules of behaviour and moral attitudes; and they are neither of them directly described in the myths and praise songs, which ascribe violence only to Shango, never to his devotees. Since the devotees do not admit their anti-social propensities, the two objects which are associated with them are perhaps for this additional reason not explained. Among those most active in the cult, two polar types may be distinguished: one is hearty, given to noisy display and fascinated by conjuring; the other is less confidently boisterous and often temperamental. Both types are subject to violent bouts of dissocia- tion or possession, and are transvestite in this state. Unbridled emotions are on the whole shown only by the priests of those Yoruba cults that recognize states of possession; and among these, Shango possessions are by far the most frequent. Although violence, generally speaking, is not a Yoruba trait, Shango and his possessed worshippers are known to be violent. Their characteristic responses are irrational, that is, they respond to objects and form images and ideas by direct unconscious perception and production, without the mediation of reflective thought or ethical considerations. Although the worshippers conform to the conventions of Yoruba behaviour in avoiding violence and destructiveness except in possession, there is good evidence that they have fantasies of</page><page sequence="4">26 JOAN WESCOTT &amp; PETER MORTON-WILLIAMS -4 V 4'' COLOUR KEY Background White Black Black Yellow Green Red</page><page sequence="5">JOAN WESCOTT &amp; PETER MORTON-WILLIAMS The Yoruba Laba Shango PLATE I *~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.. .. .... ..- ,. ...

We have heard a possession priest (his demeanour cheerful enough) saying, in the presence of a Moslem with whom he was on friendly terms, that he would murder any daughter of his who wanted to marry a Moslem; and we have also known Shango priests who believed they had used lightning in magical warfare in undercover feuds among themselves. The cult of Shango, as distinguished from his private worship, is established only in those Yoruba areas that were under the imperial rule of Oyo before its collapse in the nineteenth century. The cult has centralized organization, the occupancy of some of its highest priestly offices being confined to members of certain Oyo lineages. The rest of the priesthood, whether in Oyo or in the provinces, is recruited locally from men discovered to be subject to states of possession by Shango. Devotees may be born into the cult, or assigned to the worship of Shango by Ifa, the Yoruba god of divination. When an individual is a member of a cult from childhood, he must take part in rites addressed to the god throughout his life. But should the cult fail to satisfy the needs of his personality, symptoms of disturbance will occur. Then, through the mediation of Ifa, he may find his way into another cult where his personality matches that ofthe god, and can be defined, canalized, and fulfilled by cult membership." Novices to the priesthood of Shango are selected and partly trained by the local associations of Shango priests, but each one must travel to Oyo, accompanied by a priest as sponsor, to receive confirmation in his calling and final instruction from the Magba. As priest, he is entitled elegun, which literally translated means 'one who becomes ridden', that is, possessed by Shango. The newly selected priest must now have his first laba made. The laba serves both symbolic and utilitarian ends in cult ritual. But since its size is larger than that demanded by its contents, we relate this to its importance rather than its use. It is worn when the priest travels in his vestments to officiate in some rite away from his shrine, particularly to places where lightning has struck. His task there is to find and 'dig from the earth'"2 the thunderbolt that dogma declares Shango hurled, then to announce what sins Shango punishes by that act and what sacrifices those who live there must offer in expiation. On this and other occasions when Shango makes visible his power and anger, the laba is carried outside the shrine and worn hanging down the left side of the officiant with the strap over his opposite shoulder and diagonally across his chest (Plate II B). For reasons which are beyond the scope of this paper to elaborate fully (Morton- Williams I960), the left side is of ritual significance to the Yoruba ;13 and the diagonal line described by the strap across the chest is, as we shall see by its repetition in the panel design and in the restatement of its meaning in other ways, a suitably consistent and not merely convenient means of wearing the laba. It may be inferred from an aesthetic consideration of Yoruba art that there, as in Western culture, the diagonal line might be an expression of energy, tension, and irrationality.14 The left side indicates in the generally accepted sense the secondary and rejected contents of a culture and the repressed contents of the unconscious. Confining ourselves to the specific context of the Shango cult, some of the evidence for this generalization may be cited; one of Shango's praise songs includes the following words:</page><page sequence="10">28 JOAN WESCOTT &amp; PETER MORTON-WILLIAMS I want to hail Shango; He helped me to rebuild my husband's house ... He shouted in the roof like a spirit; He used his left hand to carry his laba. The song, sung by women devotees, tells how Shango struck a house with lightning, and in so doing filled the laba of the priest with the victimized householder's wealth which was then used to rebuild the priest's shrine. Another instance of the symbolic use of the left hand and its association with the unconscious is important. At a point in the training of a possession priest, the Magba places his left hand on the initiate's head and recites the praise names of Shango. During this recitation, the god reveals to the initiate the specific taboo that will prevent his being sent into possession at inappropriate moments. Moreover, it is a peculiarity of possession priests that Shango appears to them and speaks to them in their dreams. The Magba of the royal shrine at Koso includes in his morning recital of Shango's praise names the words, 'the dream is father of the god.' Since it has been established by psychologists that personages in dreams are manifestations of psychic complexes, it is clear that the deity Shango corresponds to some extent to unconscious complexes typical of his worshippers. Thus the impulses to violence and caprice that make up the complex typical of Shango worshippers are illustrated symbolically on the laba panel; and the wearing of the laba on the left side may be directly consistent with the fact that these impulses, appropriate to Shango, find safe expression in his cult, though they are not accepted by the Yoruba generally. This psychic complex occurring in the per- sonality structure of the devotees can only be acknowledged when projected on to the god Shango. When Shango priests in a state of possession are identified with the god, they are dominated by an otherwise repressed need to vent their aggressive and frightening impulses. The devotee in possession may without restraint exhibit his wild emotions in uninhibited displays of power and passion, disregarding the rigid code of Yoruba social etiquette. Beyond its necessity as insignia of office, it is plausible to infer that the association of a cult artifact with the left side illuminates an aspect of the god and links it with the personality complex for which it is an appropriate symbol. In this connexion it is evident why the laba must be worn by Shango priests on their expeditions to houses struck by lightning, for there they satisfy their love of destructive power by exploiting an already calamitous situation. Here is, in fact, an example of a type of anti-social behaviour which has been socially sanctioned. The rigidly standardized design on the panels of the laba is of considerable signifi- cance in the imagery of the Shango cult, and Shango priests attribute a numinous quality to it. Moreover, the design contrasts remarkably with the relative naturalism and sym- metry of the bulk of Yoruba plastic art and is, as far as we know, the freest expression drawfi from their realm of myth.'5 Since it is so very far from other Yoruba conventions, it is particularly tantalizing that the Yoruba seem to have no explanation of its meaning. We have questioned more than thirty priests in different parts of Yorubaland including the Magba of Oyo and two of his deputies, and also the Magba of the king's own Shango shrine there. We also inquired among the senior members of the Otun Shona lineage group who made the laba. None of them could explain the design or contribute</page><page sequence="11">THE YORUBA LABA SHANGO 29 a myth about it or about the introduction of the use of the laba, although over some years rapport was closely established with most of the priests consulted, including the late Magba. When the Yoruba are unwilling to disclose a myth they will as a rule either say so or fabricate an alternative; they will seldom deny its existence. On first examining the panel, the design may appear (as it has to many Europeans) to be a variation on a swastika. If we have supplemented what is present in the form through anticipating a swastika by virtue of our knowledge of it in other cultures- particularly as a form of Jupiter's lightning in Graeco-Roman iconography,16 it is none the less strongly suggestive of a stylized lightning flash. Since the priest of the thun- der god carries the laba to places where lightning has struck, it is fitting that this design be a graphic and explicit indication of function. But many elements in both the form and colour of the panel design lead beyond this first association with a swastika as a stylized lightning flash. There is a strong and ever-present tendency to anthropomorphism in Yoruba art and religious imagery, and this design, whether or not it is derived from a swastika, has apparently been anthropomorphized. Here the pattern takes the form of a dancer; and the head-dress, the dance position, and the emblematic black, white, and yellow colours of the figure lead us to postulate that this dancing figure is a representation of Eshu (Elegbara) the Yoruba trickster god.'7 The head-dress (in the upper right corner of the panel) resembles that worn by Eshu priests, although it is oversize, just as it is on the carvings for Eshu where this dis- tinguishing mark is exaggerated for emphasis (Plate III). The dance position-upper arms level with the shoulders, forearms in opposite directions (the right raised and the left one pointing downward18) and the open posture of the legs-is like the most distinc- tive of the movements in the Eshu devotees' ritual dance (Plate IV A). Energetic and sensual, the dance for Eshu is unmistakable and stands in contrast to the tightness and restraint of movements in most other Yoruba ritual dances, including those for Shango. Lines that might be considered in excess of the dancing figure contribute to the impres- sion of movement and speed. In his myths, Eshu as the trickster and god of mischief is never in any one place, but is everywhere at once. His songs and praise names tell of the dazzling speed with which he travels and of his agility as a dancer. Although the hori- zontal lozenge-shaped head is balanced by the vertical lozenge of the torso, the less rest- ful vertical and diagonal lines dominate. The tension in these lines and in the asymmetry of the design gives an impression of chaotic disorder (a situation which Eshu delights in creating), and the dancer's flexed legs add considerably to the general restlessness of the panel design.'9 Eshu stands between men and gods as mediator and agent provocateur. The Yoruba believe that it is Eshu who tricks mankind into offending the gods, thereby providing them with sacrifices. Since the Shango priest wears his laba to the house struck by light- ning where he announces what sacrifices must be made in expiation of the sins Shango is punishing, a portrayal of Eshu, the instigator of the sin, on the bag containing Shango's vengeful thunderbolt seems appropriate enough. The Yoruba say that Eshu must be given a good part of the sacrifices made to all the orisha (gods) since it is he who pro- vides the orisha with food. Since Eshu is held responsible for human folly and vulner- ability, he is seen as the force that makes men turn to the gods in acknowledgement of</page><page sequence="12">30 JOAN WESCOTT &amp; PETER MORTON-WILLIAMS their imperfections and for aid in their endeavours. Each of those gods who, it might be supposed, could support themselves through their command of the forces of swift retri- bution is shown in myth to have come in conflict with Eshu, and to have been forced to admit the necessity of his role. In one myth, for example, each thunderbolt hurled at Eshu by Shango shattered into a thousand fragments and were flung back at him. Shango had consequently to make peace with Eshu, and thereafter sacrifices provided by Eshu were readily shared with him. In myths and rituals one sees Eshu's two-way involvement; he prompts men to offend the gods, and aids the gods in their vengeance. We have witnessed Eshu worshippers come to visit a Shango priest when he was holding an inquiry at a house struck by lightning, and accept a gift from him; and we have also seen Shango transvestites attend the annual dancing festival in honour of Eshu and receive a gift as well (Plate IV B). The head possession priest in Oyo (the Odejin) during his annual celebration in worship of Shango goes accompanied by his subordinates to pay homage at the Magba's shrine; while returning, he pauses at the central shrine for Eshu in the Oyo market where he and the chiefpriest of Eshu (the Eni Oja) prostrate themselves out of respect for each other. These examples demonstrate a recognition on the part of the Yoruba of the mutually sustaining relation between the thunder god and the trickster. If the panel design on the laba has been derived from a stylized sign for lightning, it is now becoming evident why, granted anthropomorphism, it should have been trans- formed into an Eshu-like being. Shango needs Eshu as much as do the other gods, but besides this he shares with Eshu many characteristics. Among other things they share an impetuosity and a great resistance to external authority. But the most common ele- ment in the myths and songs about Shango and Eshu is power. The mythopoeic imagi- nation does not, of course, use a symbol merely to restate an otherwise adequately de- fined concept. On the contrary, symbolic forms are an important means of formulating and communicating what the imagination is striving to grasp. The dominant concep- tion which emerges in this instance is a result of the constellation of qualities relating to power. Praise songs of Shango and Eshu show some interesting parallels in Yoruba con- ceptions of the two gods, as may be seen in these examples: Shango: Take the entrance (i.e. do not come secretly through the back of the house). ... Do not do to me what I should not like, Terrible man who sat silently amongst them, Do not do to me what I should not like, Do not let me suffer, One who suffers is forgotten. ... Mounting the roof of the unbeliever He jumped on the child, on the child's head. Warrior great enough to avenge any slight, He struck down a man's house to extend his own. ... He is the one they worship in our house. He kills so that Magba may eat freely (of atonement fees). ... Shango do not let Magba take away my goods. ... If he kills the transgressor, he also kills the informer.</page><page sequence="13">THE YORUBA LABA SHANGO 31 My husband, do not wrestle with me Your wrestling tears off the child's arm. If he lifts up the anvil stone (to hurl) he will not pant. He stretched up, he stretches out ... He has a rope in his pocket for the wicked. Eshu: He came through the gutter of the house on horseback (i.e. when people were on guard against his coming through the gate). Man of i6oo clubs, He brought out for the quarrellers a wooden rod. Eshu, you are in heaven working on the world. One whom Eshu is working on won't know it. If he leaves his own house far away A housholder's house he will take. One whom Eshu is working on won't know it ... Eshu, don't work on me-work on the child of someone else. ... He spread out a festival cloth in the house of the heedless. All in our house pay heed to Eshu. Eshu, don't spread a festival cloth in our house (i.e. a new cloth to receive gifts he has exacted). ... He stood at the pounded yam seller's and did not buy (i.e. but he kept other customers away, making the vendor angry); He stood at the pounded corn seller's and did not buy. His teeth grinding like stones, He comes out bringing his club. Eshu will beat the child and make him cry unceasingly, Greatest-to-be-seen with the big wooden rod. It would be justifiable to characterize this power as phallic, particularly since the phallus is prominent in the imagery of both Shango and Eshu. Eshu's head-dress, the first of many elements leading us to postulate a representation of him on the laba, is sometimes carved as a phallus (Plate III). The phallus alone, in fact, often suffices as a representation of Eshu. Its displacement - that is, the phallus as head-dress-implies that it is not in its procreative function that the phallus is an attribute to Eshu, a con- clusion supported by Eshu myth and ritual. In his praise songs, the penis is referred to, not in connexion with procreation, but as related rather by its autonomous nature to Eshu's caprice. One instrument of Eshu's power is a club, which in the myths he puts into the hands of those who are quarrelsome, and with which he strikes those who do no' fully respect his power. Shango's thunderbolt, another phallic instrument, appropriatel) in the hands of a kingly god, similarly takes our attention away from an association of the laba with the thunderstorm's regenerative rain, and stresses instead vengeful and destructive power. Another of the phallic qualities that dominate Eshu and Shango is self-assertion and masculine striving. All these qualities are equally responsible for conflicts with the social order engendered by individual wilfulness. C J R.A.I.</page><page sequence="14">32 JOAN WESCOTT &amp; PETER MORTON-WILLIAMS The myths of the King Shango tell of his caprices and love for power; how, for example, he had yielded to the whim to play heedlessly with his magic and in so doing had destroyed himself, his palace, and many of his subjects. His praise songs, on the other hand, emphasize a wide range of phallic qualities, including his sexuality and the fecundity he gives to his worshippers. But if the imagery on the laba serves to emphasize a particular aspect of his power, it is that in which he most resembles Eshu. The posture of the panel figure-the arms in a gesture at once of violence and like a conventionalized lightning flash-directs our attention away from sexuality towards Shango's role as avenger, in which he uses lightning, his particular expression of energy, as a punishment. The seeming randomness with which Shango hurls his bolts and Eshu demonstrates his wilfulness has, so we are told, a purpose that shows the inter-relationship if not the concern of the gods with mankind. Shango's anger and power, encountered in a natural force, is equated with Eshu's, which is manifest in human strife; they appear together on the laba because each reinforces the other. What at first seems to be a shared anti- social aspect reveals itself as a demand that individual or group take into account the plans of the gods and the requirements of the whole of society. The two gods Eshu and Shango are fused and condensed in a symbol because, at some levels, they lack distinc- tion; and that Eshu comes into this design masked and disguised is no surprise in view of his role. In the design on the laba panel, form, more than colour, reveals meaning. The colours are a relatively simple statement of forces concerned, marking, as it were, the characters involved in the drama, while the intricately subtle form is more complex and more evocative. But if we turn now from the shapes to consider briefly the colours of the panel, we see that the cut-out yellow figure is traditionally decorated in black and white. These colours-yellow, black and white-are emblematic for Eshu in his cult.20 The back- ground for the figure is red, traditionally the principal colour for Shango, which seems too apposite to the character of the thunder god to require comment.21 The patches of green in the corners with their yellow borders together make up the colours proper to Ifa, the Yoruba oracle which reveals to men their destinies as well as the relationship between the gods and both society and the individual. In Yoruba cosmology, Ifa and Eshu are companion-mediators between the gods and men; and Ifa, as the principle of orderliness and of predictability, is the counterpart of Eshu, who wilfully occasions strife and can therefore be most aptly described as the un- certainty principle.22 Eshu prompts men to offend the gods; Ifa tells men how they may placate them. In Yoruba thought, the existence of the one is necessary to the existence of the other, so it is to be expected that when we find the colours and symbols of conflict (those of Shango and Eshu) in the middle of the panel, we should find also the colours symbolic of resolution (the green and yellow of Ifa) at the peripheries. Widely known myths show how Ifa and Eshu sustain each other; their relationship is an example of the balanced dualism that permeates all Yoruba religious and cosmological conceptions.23 On the laba we find the statement that violence must be surrounded by order, and motion contained by rest. But order, for the sake of renewal and development, must neverthe- less be broken (and it can perhaps be considered a concession to Eshu that the patches of green, though they mark each of the four corners of the design within the square panel, are all differently shaped). The colours then, by stating the characters involved, and</page><page sequence="15">THE YORUBA LABA SHANGO 33 also through their emotive quality, supplement form in asserting that violence must be controlled, but that disturbance is valued positively. The turbulence of the laba panel is analogous to that of the thunderstorm. The storm itself is violent, its noisy destructiveness can be felt as uncontrollable and wanton. But the storm is limited, having its function in the rhythm of nature, marking the transitions between dry and wet seasons, and bringing the heaviest rain. The activities of Eshu, like the thunderstorm, are bounded, and do not destroy the social order, but mark in- stead the transitions between stagnation and change manifested in the competition of individuals, vested interest, and factions for advantage within the relatively stable social order. While the activities of both Eshu and Shango bring about limited destruction, both ensure the regeneration of the various forms of life. We may see in the myths of Eshu a parable to the effect that mankind without -the promptings of will would cease to strive, and society and culture would stagnate: the Yoruba say that without the inter- vention of Eshu the gods would starve and vanish; and without the storms the land would not have seasons of growth, harvest, and hunting. These analogues are all in accord with a more general unstated axiom of Yoruba cosmology, and one that is implicit in the social system as much as in the religious: that all extremes generate their opposites; and further, through avoiding the supression of conflict, and by containing it instead in a state of balance, society makes it valuable and constructive. For instance, Eshu singers after they have sung the praises of Eshu, celebrating his tricks, his spreading of disorder, and his satisfying himself and his worshippers through the sacrifices of others, follow with a hymn that they said was addressed to God, the King of Heaven (the only one so addressed that we ever heard): We cannot turn from the House of the World and live . . . Eshu's devotees ... give thanks for the market the Lord of Heaven created -(Eshu is most active in the market). The children of the dwellers on Earth are not to overthrow it. They then conclude with praise of the justice of their own king, the Alafin of Oyo, and sing his praise names and those of his most renowned predecessors. In other words, Eshu's disorder is balanced by its opposite, the just law of the king, and both are con- tained within the created world. The praise songs and myths, then, say poetically what we have rephrased (supported by much other material) as a metaphysic. We may finally consider the laba as a whole. On the front, the four-times repeated panel design representing an aspect of Shango's power is ordered into a pattern of absolute symmetry. But within the panel all is asymmetry and disorder, because oppos- ing Ifa-for whom symmetry and the number four are symbolic-is the wilful trickster Eshu, the dynamic energy that explores and promotes change. In this connexion it should be recognized that the laba is composed of squares and triangles; without going deeply into the symbolic values the Yoruba find in numbers, we suggest that the seven tassels hanging from the triangular pieces at the bottom edge of every laba (quite apart from considerations of whatever historical links with the Mediterranean or Near East they may indicate) summarize the statement made by the design on the laba-the union of threeness and fourness. To the Yoruba four itself signifies completeness and</page><page sequence="16">34 JOAN WESCOTT &amp; PETER MORTON-WILLIAMS symmetry; order and the number four are all properties of Ifa. In the realm of the sacred, four conveys the structured, comprehensible, and visible relationship between gods and mankind revealed through Ifa. The number three to the Yoruba is part of the symbol complex of the deified Earth, the home of the ancestors, and signifies mystery (Morton-Williams I960). The laba as a container for the thunderbolt that Shango hurls to the earth is symbolically equivalent to the earth which receives Shango's lightning. The number symbolism asserts that the union of four and three (each with its cosmo- logical significance) produces a number which is itself indivisible, and therefore a symbol of the creation of a new form from the union of opposites. Seven then is the summation of what is gropingly apprehended through symbols (three), and that which is intellec- tually formulated (four). Magically, the laba is equal in strength to the powerful destructive thunderbolt which can be safely carried in it. As we have asserted the thunderbolt to be symbolically masculine, so is the laba symbolically feminine. Its feminine character seems to us to have been established when it was secretly opened by Shango's high priest in the rite of dedication to Shango's service. Speculating in terms of Yoruba dualism, the potency and danger of the thunderbolt is neutralized when it is contained in the laba ;24 and we see repeated in the ritual bringing together of these artifacts the search for union of masculine and feminine traits manifested in the transvestitism of Shango priests.25 The swastika itself, which can be traced in the dancing figure of Eshu, carries these meanings too; in it are found the qualities of both tension and equilibrium which to- gether produce a feeling of dynamic balance. This dynamic balance matches the licensed abandon of Shango and Eshu. And the rotary movement suggested by a swastika speaks of the eternal change for which Eshu stands, and which is not possible without the inter- mingling of opposites. As a symbol, the laba panel operates quite differently from dis- course in that it can present a multiplicity of meanings simultaneously, and in so doing serves to channel associations and apperceptions. But symbols are by their very nature inexhaustible, and meaning can continue to be drawn from them both in terms of Yoruba and our own culture. While the Yoruba seem to have lost any explanation of the meaning of the laba, its social function, as is often the case with symbols, has none the less survived. In our analysis we have sought to make clear that the symbolism of the laba panel corresponds in every detail with its ritual meaning and use; and our argument concerning the mean- ing of the laba gains force by the consistency found between symbolic meaning and ritual function. The care with which the laba is made, the strictness with which the pattern is conserved, and the conspicuousness with which it is displayed, accord with the promin- ence it acquires through being the first and highly distinctive item of ritual para- phernalia that the new priest of Shango must obtain. We have made our analysis include every detail of the design that we can distinguish, and have shown each symbolic form to contribute to the religious meaning of the laba. Moreover, the sacra- ment of its opening by the Magba and the symbolism of the decoration clarify the reason why the thunderbolt must be carried in it. The symbolism, although complex, is constructed on only two principles, the first being that of clarification by analogy, and the second being a heightening of the experience of the given through the awareness of its opposite.</page><page sequence="17">THE YORUBA LABA SHANGO 35 The laba bears on its cover the symbols and emblems of the cultural drama the Yoruba see enacted when lightning strikes: through the provocation of Eshu, Shango's thunderbolts are loosed upon mankind; through the agency of Ifa men learn how to grow with the demands of the gods. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We wish to thank J. T. Hooper, Esq., for allowing us to photograph the carving in Plate III. Many friends and colleagues have earned our thanks by giving us their responses to the design on the laba panel. We are grateful, too, to many of them for helpful comments on drafts of the paper, especially to members of the staff of the Anthropology Department at University College London, particularly to Mr Robin Horton; and we should also like to thank Professor E. H. Gombrich and Dr Leopold Stein for their help and encouragement. NOTES 'There are many references to Shango in publications about the Yoruba, but much of the description is misleading. The best ethnographic material-well illustrated-is in (a) Frobenius (I9I2), and (b) Verger (I 957). 2 The carrying of the laba has fallen into abeyance in Oyo during the last few years. It appears that the last full dress procession of priests was in 1954 or 1955. 3 Frobenius includes drawings by Carl Arriens of a laba in The Voice of Africa. We note that he picks out the same elements of the design as the main structure as we do; and further, that these laba, made before I9I0, are substantially the same as the one made in I957. 4 In towns other than Oyo we have seen a few laba without the usual decorations in the front panels. H. U. Beier in his book The Story of Sacred Woodcarvings from One Small roruba Town (Lagos, The Nigeria Magazine Office, 1957) has included a photograph taken in Ilobu (about fifty miles from Oyo), showing two unusual laba. It is noteworthy that these two deviant specimens hang not in the shrine but over the entrance, while other conventional ones hang within. Possibly these were made, if in Oyo at all, by another segment of the leather workers' lineage-by the members of the Osi Shona perhaps, who have asserted that they know how to make them. They did not claim that the Magba ever commissioned laba from them, and the fact that they offered to make them for us without consulting him suggests that some Shango worshippers have obtained laba, probably for the decoration of their shrines, in this very likely less costly way. 5 Where exceptions to the colour arrangement do occur, we are inclined to think of them as recent and decadent variations. 6 In the Iyaji ward of Oyo. 7He declared that the fee he would ordinarily be paid for opening the laba before handing it over to the priest would be two guineas and some gin, and he would in addition require a cock for sacrifice to Shango. Alternatively, the Magba can take animals (Shango's set of sacrificial animals, e.g. the ram, he-goat, snail, and cock) and bitter kola (also appropriate to Shango) from the new priest. All this is beyond the cost of the laba itself, which was about C7. 8 The 'aradung' of Frobenius. 9 When the Dahomians incorporated the cult of Shango into their religion, they. replaced the oshe by an axe with a single blade. Examples held by devotees of Xevioso, the Dahomian Shango, are illus- trated by P. Verger (1952; 1957). It is interesting to find in these publications a photograph showing an oshe of the Shango worshippers in Brazil to be a double-bladed metal axe (Plate 55). Jean Rouche (I960) considers the Songhai thunder god Dongo to have been derived from Shango. In Songhai the thunder axe has a single blade and a bell on the back of the handle (Plates I and VI). The outward diffusion of the Shango cult from Oyo makes it particularly difficult to trace the route by which the main elements in this complex reached Oyo.</page><page sequence="18">36 JOAN WESCOTT &amp; PETER MORTON-WILLIAMS 10 Thus, not only does it appear that no myths about the laba are current, but likewise none concern- ing the double-headed axe (an implement not utilized by the Yoruba) on which the wooden dance staff is modelled. This staff (oshe) is often a carved skeuomorph. Yet, although the representation is unmis- takable, the Shango worshippers do not recognize it to be one, though with the oshe they insist, just as they do with the laba, that the form be preserved. Il This, generally speaking, is true of all Yoruba cults. The Magba, however (and other cult officials of the central Shango hierarchy), may not always exhibit personality traits matching those of the wor- shippers and the god since his post is hereditary, and generally passes by primogeniture. 12 This of course must be shammed. Shango personalities are usually very adept at this and many other kinds of conjuring. "I The left side and the diagonal line in the ritual and art of other Yoruba cults will be examined at some length in our forthcoming book on Yoruba art and religion. Evans-Pritchard has analysed the sig- nificance of a similar consciousness of the meaning of the left side among the Nuer. 14 The effect of the diagonal line can be seen most clearly in Baroque and contemporary sculpture and painting. 15 Apart from the conventionally abstract forms of the Yoruba denotative signs seen on the walls of some shrines. For an example of this type of mural art see the photographs on pages 2 I 9 and 221 with our article entitled 'The Festival of Iya Mapo' in Nigeria Magazine, no. 58, 1958. 16 The double axe is a symbol forJupiter as well as for Shango. 17 Another striking parallel suggested by the design which ought not to be ignored is that between Eshu and the West African fables of the clever and conspiring spider, particularly in view of the fact that the design itself was seen by many Westerners to resemble a spider. Since a symbol condenses and can contain many meanings, a swastika, a spider, and Eshu can simultaneously appear in a configuration which links their common features. 18 Returning again to Evans-Pritchard's analysis of Nuer ideas concerning the left and right sides, it is the left horn of a man's ox, the beast with which he is in many ways identified, which is trained down- wards. "I Of some fifty occidentals to whom we have shown this laba panel decoration, about thirty have perceived a figure in a dance position. Concerning the spirit of the dance, many moods were described: while vigour is common to all, he is seen as jubilant, violent, boisterous, threatening, jocular, and so on. Perhaps the truest understanding comes with accepting the possibility that a wide range of emotions is at once contained. 20 We have recently seen these colours worn in combination in a pattern on an imported cotton cloth which was made up as the uniform attire of the Oyo Eshu worshippers for their annual festival. (See Plate IVB.) 21 Though it does receive comment in a Shango praise song where the red is said to refer not only to the red-dyed clothes of the possession priest, but also to the blood of sacrifices, which, after some is poured on the cult objects, is poured over the priest while he is in possession. 22 This apt metaphor for Eshu was coined by Professor N. A. Barnicot in conversation with Morton- Williams in 1950. 28 Eshu (Elegbara) and Ifa are being treated at some length in other papers in progress. 24 When, after lightning has struck, the thunderbolt has been 'dug from the ground' by the priest, he puts it into a bowl of palm oil to 'cool' it. This is an interesting parallel with the Yoruba rule that the mud pillar in Eshu shrines must be kept 'cool' with palm oil poured over it daily; were it to become dry, Eshu's most destructive trickery would bedevil those within the parish of the shrine, whether house compound, or the whole town. The Shango priest carries the thunderbolt away only when all the fines have been paid and atonement made. 26 This feature, and others of the Shango ritual, will be taken up in a subsequent publication.
