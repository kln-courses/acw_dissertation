(Aratus, Phaenomena 529-33) arte Syracosia suspensus in aere clauso stat globus, immensi parua figura poli (Ovid, Fasti 6.277-8) Introduction The astronomy in the Fasti is indebted to Aratus, as was presumably Ovid's own Phaenomena ' . 1 The relationship between the astronomical material in Ovid' s Fasti and the astronomical poem by Aratus of Soli, composed under the auspices of Antigonus Gonatas in about 278 B.C., is indisputable; but the nature of this relationship has not been explored. Such an exploration may add a new layer of meaning to Ovid's poem, as an entity which responds not only to aetiological models but also to 'scientific' didactic models. My project in this paper is one part of such an exploration. My aim here is to examine a passage which, although it is not overtly astronomical in the way that Ovid's calendrical notes of the risings and settings of stars are, can be seen as representative of the dialectic between the Fasti and the Phaenomena. This is the image of the Sphere of Archimedes (Fasti 6.277), which is placed in the context of the Vestalia (Fasti 6.249^68). Ovid's treatment of this festival has been seen by critics as particularly capricious and disjunct.

A systematic exploration of the relationship between the astronomical parts of the Fasti and Aratus' Phaenomena is the subject of my unpublished doctoral dissertation.</page><page sequence="2">22 EMMA GEE describes it as 'questo fascio di piccole disannonie'. Elaine Fantham brought out the problems both of the Vestalia itself and of its structural place in the Fasti in her discussion of the reduplication of the Priapus episode of lines 3 19-46. Gareth Williams showed how a conflict in the passage between Ovid's stance as inspired uates and the derivative, literary nature of his information, serves to destabilize the poet's narratorial position; most recently Carole Newlands developed this reading to argue that the three incompatible views of Vesta that Ovid presents - rationalizing, popular, and Augustan - are part of a cumulative destabilization of the 'didactic, aetiological intent' of the Fasti ? The questions I propose to ask in my exegesis of the Vestalia are different from those of other critics. They will concern astronomy, philosophy, and allegory. My aim here is to demonstrate that the literary history of lines 265-304 of the Vestalia , which can be ascertained through the particular elements they contain and the way in which these are combined, ties them in with a Stoic tradition of cosmology and exegesis. Thus they may be seen as closely related to Aratus' Phaenomena and its Stoic subtext.3 I will argue that the Temple of Vesta presents a synoptic view of the world, an imago mundi , which functions in addition as an image of the poem itself.4 The Temple of Vesta, like the Sphere of Archimedes, its analogue, is a microcosmic representation of the universe; as well as this it acts as a microcosm of the way the Fasti functions as an artistic entity, in its juxtaposition of philosophical and mythical, Greek and Roman elements, inside the framework provided by the Roman festivals. In addition, Ovid's Temple of Vesta will be seen to be a representation of the world of Aratus' Phaenomena , which Ovid lets us see briefly, while simultaneously corroding its unity by placing it in the problematic context of the Vestalia. (i) Fasti 6.267-304 and the astronomical tradition In the first half of the Vestalia , which has been neglected by previous critics, Ovid expounds a rationalistic Vesta: a philosophical composite. Three elements occur within the frame of a double aetiology (Vesta as earth / Vesta as fire): a synoptic world-picture {Fasti 6.267-76); analogy of this world- view with the planetarium of Archimedes (277-80); and an allegorical explanation of the goddess through Hesiodic cosmogony 2 Börner (1957-8) ii. 353, Barchiesi (1994) 195, Fantham (1983), Williams (1991), Newlands (1995) 124-45. 3 Critics are divided as to the extent of Stoic influence on the Phaenomena. For a cross-section of opinion, see James (1972), Effe (1977), Kenney (1979), Bulloch (1985), Hopkinson (1988), and Hunter (1995). I believe that the poem is Stoic throughout, and that Stoic philosophy provides the best interpretative strategy for it. This view can be supported by factors such as the high degree of Stoic influence discernible in ancient Aratean interpretative scholarship, and the use of Aratus by Cicero in the Stoic book of the De natura deorum , which will be studied below. 4 For the terms of my argument I am indebted to Hardie (1985).</page><page sequence="3">OVID' S VEST ALI A AND THE PHAENOMENA OF ARATUS 23 {Fasti 6.285-6 = Theogony 453^1). Element three jars with elements one and two: the rational versus the mythical, the incorporeal versus the anthropomorphic. The juxta- position of these can be seen to be a significant factor in the articulation of Ovid's programme. The double aetiology of the goddess Vesta, as earth and as fire, is problematic. Not only does the identification of Vesta as the earth fail to be explained by a cult in which fire is central, but Ovid leaves her conflicting identities unresolved, even balancing them compositionally: 267-8 earth and fire5 291-2 fire 297-8 fire 301 fire 460 earth Ovid chooses to expound the identity of Vesta as earth as the cause of the shape of the temple, despite the fact that fire carries the greater overall weight in the passage. This aetion of Vesta as earth, with which we are primarily concerned here, is not itself straightforward. In the explanation of Vesta as the earth, the fundamental idea is that of sphericity: terra pilae similis (269), orbem (271), and, of the model adduced as her analogy, globus (278), a term which is glossed by Cicero in N.D. 2.47 by the Greek o(paiQa. This forma rotunda of the earth (280) is said to be the reason for the forma templi (265). But can a temple be spherical? Coins struck near the end of Tiberius' reign represent the Temple of Vesta as a circular structure with a conical roof.6 Let us look more closely at the progression of the argument in lines 268-80. As presented by the poet it seems logical: Ovid's object is to explain the shape of the temple (265-6) Vesta is the same as the earth (267-8) The temple is round because the earth is round (269-70) Lines 271-76 answer a question which is elided: 'But why is the earth round?'7 The answer is, 'Because this is the shape that ensures its equidistance from every part of the universe and dictates that it remain still (enabling Ovid to give the etymology 5 Compare Servius Auctus on Aen. 2.296: Vestam deam ignis, quae, ut supra diximus, terra est: quod in medio mundo librata ui sua stet et ignem intra se habeat. alii de igne diuino hoc uolunt dictum quod ui sua stet, inde Vestam. Note that the Servian etymology is the same as Ovid's ui stando ( Fasti 6.299), and that the goddess has the same dual identity as earth and fire. Is Servius following Ovid or can a common, perhaps Varronian, source be postulated? On the etymology of Vesta see Maltby (1991) 640. 6 Platner and Ashby (1929) 557-9. ' Lines 271-6 have been considered by some to be interpolated, since they do not appear in some of the best manuscripts, and have thus been excised from the text. However, as Postgate (1910) 198 pointed out, they are in the Ursinianus, which is the best authority; and as well as this the reason for their omission in the other manuscripts is obvious: the homoeoteleuton onus, which occurs at the end of lines 270 and 276.</page><page sequence="4">24 EMMA GEE ui stando in line 299) and in equipoise at the centre of the universe ( libratum , 271)'. 271 may be translated, 'Its very rotundity keeps the globe in equilibrium'.8 Having devised this progression, Ovid can now with no difficulty extrapolate to a geometrical model of the earth, the globe of Archimedes (277-80). The sphaera is a better analogy for the world- view that Ovid has just presented than for the temple, and this is what leads the poet to expound philosophy here rather than the cultic aetiology proposed at 265-6. In the progression of the argument as we have just seen it, the world- view becomes primary, the globe and temple parallel analogies for it. Ovid's association of Vesta with the globe of Archimedes is unique. Why does the poet identify Vesta with the earth and thereby create a philosophizing analogy with Archimedes' sphaera ? Why has he conceived of his aetion as an exemplum of didactic astronomy? Part at least of the answer is this: as well as making the passage astro- nomical, since its function is essentially that of a geometric aid to the practice of geocentric astronomy, the sphaera makes the passage Stoic, through the other literary contexts in which it appears.9 The Stoic/astronomical equation gives us Aratus, and this is a starting-point from which to visualize the relationship between the Vesta passage as a representation of the Fasti and Aratus' poem. With this in mind, let us look in more detail at the three elements of the rationalizing section of the Vestalia. (a) The sphaera arte Syracosia suspensus in aere clauso stat globus, immensi parua figura poli, et quantum a summis, tantum secessit ab imis terra; quod ut fiat forma rotunda facit. ( Fasti 6.277-80) These lines refer to a globe made by the Syracusan mathematician Archimedes (c.287-212 B.C.).10 Archimedes was known to Livy as unicus spectator caeli siderumque.n The sphere of Archimedes to which Ovid refers was brought back, with one other, by M. Claudius Marcellus after his sack of Syracuse in 212 B.C., as Cicero tells us in Rep. 1.2 1-2: 12 8 Postgate (1910) 200. 9 The Sphere of Archimedes occurs three times in literature before Ovid. All three occurrences are in the philosophical works of Cicero: Rep. 1.21-2, Tusc. 1.63, and N.D. 2.88. Later references include Lact. Inst. 2.5.18, Sext. Emp. Adv. Math. 9.1 15; Mart. Cap. 6.585-9. 10 Börner (1957-8) ad loc. On the globe of Archimedes, and ancient planetaria generally, see Pease (1958) on Cicero N.D. 2.88. 11 Livy 24.34.2. 12 See also Plutarch, Marc. 14-19.

The globe described by Ovid must have been a scale model of the whole cosmos (not just the earth), as we find it defined by the Syracusan himself at the beginning of his work, the Arenarius (ó Wappírqç, the 'Sand-Reckoner', an extended calculation of how many grains of sand would be required to fill the volume of the universe): xaxéxeiç àè ôióxi xaXeixai xóapoç imò p,èv xã&gt;v jtA-eiaxcov áaxQoXóyíov à atpaipa, áç èoxi xbvxqov pèv xò xãç yãç xbvxqov, à ôè èx xoõ xévxQOU toa xãi euöeiai xãi pexa^b xoõ xévxQou xoõ áÀiou xai xob xévxQou xãç yãç.13 'Cosmos is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere whose centre is the centre of the earth and whose radius is equal to the distance between the centre of the sun and the centre of the earth'.14 In Rep. 1.22 Cicero describes two types of model globes, solid and hollow. Archimedes made both kinds - a solid, 'Eudoxan' one, and a more complex 'armillary' version:15 dicebat enim Gallus sphaerae illius alterius solidae atque plenae uetus esse inuentum, et earn a Thalete Milesio primum esse tornatam, post autem ab Eudoxo Cnidio, discípulo, ut ferebat, Piatonis, eandem illam astris stellisque, quae cáelo inhaererent, esse descriptam; cuius omnem ornatum et descriptionem sumptam ab Eudoxo multis annis post non astrologiae scientia, sed poetica quadam 13 Text in Mugler (1971). 14 Trans. Dijksterhuis (1987) 362. 15 Archimedes' globe was made of either glass (Claudian, Carm. min. 5 1 . 1 ) or bronze (as here, in aere ilio). It is not clear exactly what Ovid means by in aëre clauso ( Fasti 6.277), 'in trapped air'. The poet is either visualizing the sphere as containing air trapped in glass; or perhaps clauso is better taken as the air inside being 'defined' by the bronze bands which represented the celestial circles on an armillary sphere. The probability for bronze is increased by Propertius 4. 1 .76, where the astrologer Horus is not nescius aerata signa mouere pila , not unversed in the art of moving the heavenly bodies around on a bronze planetarium; and by the fact that it is hard to imagine that such a complex thing could have been achieved in ancient glass. The simpler answer is that in his reading of this passage of Cicero, Ovid saw in aere ('in bronze') and wrote in aere ('in air'). Whatever the case, the phrase is primarily designed to strike an exact parallel between the globe and the earth itself, which in 270 was resting aëre subiecto.</page><page sequence="6">26 EMMA GEE facúltate uersibus Aratum extulisse. hoc autem sphaerae genus, in quo solis et lunae motus inessent et earum quinqué stellarum, quae errantes et quasi uagae nominarentur, in ilia sphaera solida non potuisse finiri, atque in eo admirandum esse inuentum Archimedi, quod excogitasset, quern ad modum in dissimillimis motibus inaequabiles et uarios cursus seruaret una conuersio. hanc sphaeram Gallus cum moueret, fiebat, ut soli luna totidem conuersionibus in aere ilio, quot diebus in ipso caelo, succederei, ex quo et in sphaera solis fieret eadem ilia defectio et inciderei luna tum in earn metam, quae esset umbra terrae, cum sol e regione . . . (the text breaks off). The latter must be the one Ovid is thinking of in the Fasti , since only in this type would one have been able to gain a picture of the centrality of the earth inside the mundus ( Fasti 6.269-80). The point Cicero's speaker is making about the more complex sphere built by Archimedes is that it supersedes the inventions of Thaïes and Eudoxus. Important also is his attribution to Aratus of a kind of 'commentary' on the model of Eudoxus; I shall deal presently with this latter point. Another Ciceronian passage in which the Sphere of Archimedes occurs is A.D. 2.88. The context of the passage is an argument for the rationality of the universe (as evident primarily through astronomical phenomena), which for the Stoic speaker is analogous to the rationality displayed in art, one manifestation of which (a particularly appropriate one, since it is in fact a microcosmic representation of the universe) is a sphaera made by Posidonius:16 quodsi in Scythiam aut in Britanniam sphaeram aliquis tulerit hanc quam nuper familiaris noster effecit Posidonius, cuius singulae conuersiones idem efficiunt in sole et in luna et in quinqué stellis errantibus quod efficitur in caelo singulis diebus et noctibus, quis in ilia barbaria dubitet quin ea sphaera sit perfecta ratione? hi autem dubitant de mundo ex quo et oriuntur et fiunt omnia, casune ipse sit effectus aut necessitate aliqua an ratione ac mente diuina, et Archimedem arbitrantur plus ualuisse in imitandis sphaerae conuersionibus quam naturam in efficiendis, praesertim cum multis partibus sint illa perfecta quam haec simulata sollertius. I believe this passage to be important for understanding what Ovid is doing in the passage of the Vestalia where he combines the Sphere of Archimedes and a picture of the geocentric universe. The sphere shows us Ovid in Stoicising mode. In Cicero it forms part of an explicitly Stoic argument from design for the rationality of the universe and its maker, as well as a device in the speaker Balbus' anti-Epicurean argument, according to which the misguided (i.e. the Epicureans) 'think that Archimedes' achievement in imitating the revolutions of the celestial sphere was greater than that of Nature in bringing them about, although the latter is a far more 16 This passage is the only evidence for a sphere of Posidonius. The allusion to such a sphere may in fact be a device of Cicero to indicate his Posidonian source here (Pease (1958) ad loc.).</page><page sequence="7">OVID' S VEST ALI A AND THE PHAENOMENA OF ARATUS 27 skilful artistic achievement than its imitation'. Thus Archimedes and his sphaera can be seen to have been coopted in the service of polemic: the fully and explicitly Stoic argument with which Baibus in De natura deorum 2 replies to his Epicurean opponent of book l.17 Note how, in the Ciceronian passage, Archimedes becomes the author of the sphaera , by a transition which is hardly noticeable: a kind of 'folding in' occurs, of the historical Posidonius, Cicero's Stoic source, into the quasi-legendary figure of Archimedes. Ovid must surely be taking on Stoic baggage when he imports into his Ve s talia the image of the Sphere of Archimedes. In doing this he announces his affiliation to other literary contexts in which the sphaera occurs, namely philosophical writing, particularly Stoic or Stoicizing. The technical image allows the poet to masquerade as a writer in the philosophical didactic tradition at this point in the Fasti. This argument can be supported by examination of the second element of the rationalizing part of the Vestalia , the world picture. (b) The world picture It is easier for the moment to think of Ovid's sphaera not so much as an analogy for the temple of Vesta, but as an analogy for the world- view he presents:18 Vesta eadem est et terra: subest uigil ignis utrique: significant sedem terra focusque suam. terra pilae similis, nullo fulcimine nixa, aere subiecto tarn graue pendei onus: ipsa uolubilitas libratum sustinet orbem, quique premat partes angulus omnis abest: cumque sit in media rerum regione locata, ut tangat nullum plusue minusue latus, ni conuexa foret, parti uicinior esset, nec medium terram mundus haberet onus. {Fasti 6.267-76) Compare Aratus' setting up of the structure of his world at Phaenomena 19-26, which creates the basis for the exposition of the stars in the rest of his work: oí (àoxéQeç) pèv ópwç Jto^éeç te xai àXkvb iç akkoi èóvxeç oÙQavœi ëXxovxai jrávx' rjpaxa cruvexèç aíer anxàp ö y' oů ó' òXíyov pexavíooexai, àkkà páÀ' abxcoç 17 Archimedes' own philosophical orientation is disputed. Scholars run the gamut of possibilities: Pythagorean, Democritean, Platonic, Aristotelian or Stoic (see Dijksterhuis (1987) 440). IX 'The sole point of the citation of Archimedes' model here is to illustrate the place of the earth' (Postgate (1910) 197).</page><page sequence="8">28 EMMA GEE â^œv aièv aQTļQ8v, e%ei ò' àxáÀ,avxov ájrávxr] 1ieoor1YÙç yaiav, jtepL ò5 oúpavòv aúxòv àyivel. xaí piv jteiQaívouôi òúoo jtóX-oi aļiqpox8Qa)08v a)0C ó pèv oux èmojtxoç, ô ô5 àvxíoç èx ßopeao ůipó0ev (bxeavoio . . . This world view is similar to that of Ovid in its description of the centrality, stability and equipoise of the earth. Aratus' àxáXavxov does the work of Ovid's libratum ( Fasti 6.271) and suspensus (278) in expressing this. The same picture is implicit in Ovid's etymology ui stando at Fasti 6.299, dependent as it is on the idea of the earth's stability. Aratus is a Stoic poet, and his world picture can be compared with the most detailed exposition of the structure of the universe from the Stoic book of Cicero's De natura deorum (2.1 15-16): 19 nec uero haec solum admirabilia, sed nihil maius quam quod ita stabilis est mundus atque ita cohaeret, ad permanendum ut nihil ne excogitan quidem possit aptius. omnes enim partes eius undique medium locum carpessentes nituntur aequaliter. maxime autem corpora inter se iuncta permanent cum quasi quodam uinculo circumdato colligantur; quod facit ea natura quae per omnem mundum omnia mente et ratione conficiens funditur et ad medium rapit et conuertit extrema, quocirca si mundus globosus est ob eamque causam omnes eius partes undique aequabiles ipsae per se atque inter se continentur, contingere idem terrae necesse est, ut omnibus eius partibus in medium uergentibus (id autem medium infimum in sphaera est) nihil interrumpat quo labefactari possit tanta contentio grauitatis et ponderum. This passage shows how the world's equilibrium is maintained by the striving of all parts towards the middle of the sphere, stabilis and permanendum carry the idea of Aratus' a^cov aíèv aprļpev and àxáXavxov ájtávxr] (Ph. 22). Because Aratus' earth is seen to be stable and 'in the middle' (Ph. 23), it can be said that his universe is implicitly round, like Cicero's mundus globosus , in which all things are attracted towards the centre. These elements can in turn be paralleled from Ovid. Cicero's medium locum carpessentes is like Fasti 6.273 and 276; Cicero's use of aequaliter / aequabiles / aequa- biliter conveys the same idea as Ovid's absence of anguli ('unequal protruberances') in Fasti 6.272, an absence which means that the earth is exactly central (ut tangat nullum plusue minusue latus , 274). Ovid's uolubilitas , 'sphericity' (Fasti 6.271) and globus , ('sphere') of the earth's model (278), are parallel to Cicero's globosus , sphaera , 19 See N.D. 2.54, 90, 98. The earliest Ciceronian version of this type of world picture is De orat. 3.178: incolumitatis ac salutis omnium causa uidemus hunc statum esse huius totius mundi atque naturae, rotundum ut caelum terraque ut media sit eaque sua ui nutuque teneatur; sol ut earn circum feratur, ut accedat ad brumale signum et inde sensim ascendat in diuersam partem; ut luna accessu et recessu [ suo ] solis lumen accipiat; ut eadem spatia quinqué stellae dispari motu cursuque confidant. A Posidonian source may be possible here also.</page><page sequence="9">OVID' S VEST ALIA AND THE PHAENOMENA OF ARATUS 29 conglobatur. The equilibrium of the earth - Ovid's libratum - is seen to be contingent upon this shape ( uolubilitas ): ipsa uolubilitas libratum sustinet orbem ( Fasti 6.271). The disposition of elements in concentric spheres, which is next described by Cicero (N.D. 2.11 7), marries an ongoing elemental cosmogony - the levels to which the elements constantly move as a result of their relative mass creating the stability of the universe - with the picture of the spherical universe as we have it in Ovid's Vesta passage: eademque ratione mare, cum supra terram sit, medium tarnen terrae locum expetens conglobatur undique aequabiliter neque redundat umquam neque effunditur. huic autem continens aër fertur ille quidem leuitate sublimis, sed tarnen in omnes partes se ipse fundit; itaque et mari continuatus et iunctus est et natura fertur ad caelum, cuius tenuitate et calore temperatus uitalem et salutarem spiri tum praebet animantibus. quem complexa summa pars caeli, quae aetheria dicitur, et suum retinet ardorem tenuem et nulla admixtione concretum et cum aëris extremitate coniungitur.20 This is like what we find in Achilles, one of the Stoicizing commentators on Aratus, who in his introductory work, the so-called Isagoge , describes the cosmos as a series of concentric spherical shells: rov ôè ai08Qa xai ouQavóv, eïxe ó auxoç eïxe ôiáqpoQoç, è§co0ev eivai ocpaiQixòv o/fļ^a è/ovxa. pexà òè xoñxov èvxòç aůxoíj xòv àéç&gt;a eivai xai auxòv acpaiQixíbç jteQixeípevov e^o)0ev xfji yfļi èvòoxéQO) ôè avxov XQixqv eivai acpaiQav xqv xov bôaxoç jt8QÌ auxqv xfļv yqv pexa^ù xoõ àégoç xai xfjç. èv òè xã)i peoaixáxooi xqv yfjv eivai xévxQOU xá^iv xai péye0oç èjtéxouoav [obç aí ocpaÍQai]. xai xàç pèv ãXkaç XQetç oqpaíçaç fļ xéooaQaç jteQiôiveio0ai, xqv ôè xqç yqç |xóvqv éoxávai.21 eEaxávai - the idea of stability - is what gives rise to the etymology ui stando in Fasti 6.299.

See Wheeler (1995). 21 Maass (1898) 32. Achilles was identified by Maass as a grammarian of the third century A.D. (proleg. xvi-xvii). Neugebauer ( 1 975) 666 agreed with this date. For Achilles as belonging to a group of Stoicizing commentators on Aratus see Maass (1898) proleg. xlix. The Isagoge is described by Neugebauer (1975) 95 1 . The part preserved is probably only the first chapter of a general treatise on astronomy which was adapted to become a commentary on Aratus. This seems to me to show how important Aratus was in antiquity as a way into astronomy for the layman; in order to 'sell' his work on astronomy, Achilles had to turn it into a commentary on Aratus. 22 Postgate (1914) 246-7. 23 Cf.

This is perhaps why in lines 295-6 she is said to be aniconic. Her temple is an imago mundi - a visual representation of an abstract philosophical picture of the universe - and is thus parallel to the Sphere of Archimedes. So far we have explored two of the elements in Ovid's first aition of Vesta: a world picture which could be regarded as Stoic, and the analogy for this, the Sphere of Archimedes. The combination of these renders the first part of the Vesta passage astro- nomical and philosophical, and in so doing brings it into a general relation with Aratus' Phaenomena. The coincidence of elements (a) and (b) is significant in supporting the view of a Stoic underpinning to Fasti 6.267-304. Recall N.D. 2.88. Here we saw that the globe of Archimedes was assimilated to Cicero's source Posidonius, thus appro- priating it as an image of the Stoic cosmos. The astronomical model is used to express the Stoic world-picture; and both of these elements can be seen as recurring in Ovid. Stoic exegesis, as we find it in the De natura deorum , could be regarded as the precedent. (c) The intrusion and resolution of theogony We now reach the problem of the clash between the Hesiodic mythical material which forms an alternative aition for Vesta's virginity in lines 285-90, and the rationalizing material which precedes it. Ovid's paraphrase of Theogony 453-4 marks the intrusion of Hesiodic material into philosophical discourse: TeiTļ ôè 0prļ08ioa Kqóvcoi xéxe cpatôipa xéxva, Taxíqv Af|p,rļXQa xai "Hprļv xQucrojcéôiÀov. ex Ope Iunonem memorant Cereremque creatas semine Saturni; tertia Vesta fuit. 24 Postgate (1914) 247. 25 Postgate (1918) 139.</page><page sequence="11">OVID' S VEST ALI A AND THE PHAENOMENA OF ARATUS 3 1 utraque nupserunt, ambae peperisse feruntur; de tribus impatiens restitit una uiri. ( Fasti 6.285-8) However, the opposition between physics and myth is not a straightforward one, being partially resolvable through the interpretative technique of allegory. This brings us even closer to the literary/philosophical genre to which Ovid has already tied himself by combining Archimedes and the world view: Stoic or Stoicizing exegesis. We know that Hesiodic allegory was practised from the early Stoa: Zeno, the founder of the school, is mentioned by name in the scholia to the Theogony , on lines 117, 134 and 139, Chrysippus on 135 and 459; in the De natura deorum Cicero has his Epicurean speaker describe the practice of allegorizing by Zeno, Chrysippus and others.26 Aratus himself appropriated Hesiod, even if not for specifically allegorical ends.27 The commentators on the Phaenomena seem in turn to have followed the allegorizing trend in Stoic scholarship. Ovid's connection between Hesiod and the world picture may arise in an Aratean exegetical tradition similar to that of the writings collected by Ernst Maass. 'Anonymus I', for example, begins his introductory section, TIeqí aQxfjç, with a cosmogony which emphasizes the centrality and stasis of the earth, and the motion of the universe round it: ifļv yfjv ouv ovoav ßaQUTcrcryv jxéoqv onveßq ovv a%Qr'vai ... xò &lt;yàq&gt; jiveñpa Ttavxaxó0ev jteQieAxxoav atjxqv èv péaooi axqvai xoñ Jtavxòç cpuaf|paxoç onvé/ev . . . cbç oův imooxáOpq ovoa òià xò ßapog Jtpcbxq p,exà xò xá°Ç ftéjrqyev.28 He follows this directly by a quotation of the Hesiodic cosmogony of Theogony 116-17: ôià xoñxo xai eHaíoòoç xoux' eíòcóç cpqaiv: qxoi ¡rev jTQoaxioxa xáoç yévex5, a vxaQ ejteixa yaf ei)Qi)ox8Qvoç, jkxvxoov eòoç àacpakèç aieí.

Thus we have here the constituents of Fasti 6.267-304: cosmology and connection with Aratus (the world-picture, Fasti 6.269-80, which is like Phaenomena 2 Iff.), and a Hesiodic parallel {Fasti 6.285-8). The Aratean scholia, notably on line 22 of the Phaenomena , expound a similar world- view, and follow it directly with Theogony 1 24-5 : 29 axa^avxov ájrávxrp l'orļv xai omotav xai abxq yàg otpaigoeiòqç xai ô obgavóç. eHoíoòoç* yala òé toi jcqcotov pèv èyeívaxo loov eauxfji obgavòv áoxegóevxa. Here Hesiod is being used to say something about the form of the earth and of the heavens: a mythological and poetic exemplum for a philosophical point. In both of these cases, some kind of allegorizing (the scientific explanation of myth, or the interpretation of myth as proto-science) is going on between the world view and Hesiod. Likewise, in a section of the so-called Isagoge 30 entitled Elegi àjtooxáaeooç Toi) obgavoõ aitò xfjç yfjç, the author advances the proposition that the heaven is as far from the earth as is the earth from Tartarus, and calls on Hesiod to illustrate it: ó yoõv TToloòoç cpuoixeuóp,evóę (prļoiv êvvéa yàg vúxxaç xe xai fļ(iaxa xàXxeoç âxjioov obgavó0ev xaxubv ôexáxr]i èç yaiav ïxoixo. eixa jiqòç xò ïoov (xò) ßa0og xf1ç yfjç* êvvéa ò5 ab vúxxaç xe xai fļļxaxa xáÀxeoç âx^ioov eiç yatav xaxtàv òexáxi1i èç xágxagov ïxoi.31 These lines of Hesiod could equally well be used in illustration of Fasti 6.273-6: cumque sit in media rerum regione locata, ut tangat nullum plusue minusue latus, ni conuexa foret, parti uicinior esset, nec medium terram mundus haberet onus. 29 Maass (1898) 341 gives the line-numbering as 124-5.

The conjunction of elements in the rationalizing part of Ovid's Vestalia could support a hypothesis that Ovid was following not just the De natura deorum , which provides a solution for the equation of elements (a) and (b), but some kind of Stoicizing commentary or collection of explicatory lemmata on the Phaenomena , much like that which still exists in Maass' 1898 edition of the Aratean commentaries, which uses Hesiod in an Aratean context, and thus provides us with a precedent for Ovid's combination of element (c) with (a) and (b).32 If this is so, then Ovid's programme here is to show himself as working in the tradition of Hesiodic allegory as practised by the Stoics, including the commentators on Aratus. This technique represents a method of making a straightforward connection between mythology and physics, pi30oç and À,ó yoç, the poem and the universe. Allegory and interpretative scholarship (such as the commentators on Aratus) mediate between these two different 'languages' . Ovid is discussing in the Vestalia not only the universe itself, but the different ways of talking about the universe which form part of his project in the Fasti. Involved in this is the further question of the poem's status as work of art in relation to Aratus' Phaenomena , a work which has been seen as conveying cosmological truth (the Xóyoç of the poem equating with the Xóyoç of the universe).33 (ii) Art, Aratus and the Fasti So far the relationship between Ovid and Aratus might have been expressed in terms of a binary opposition: in Aratus, the poem represents the universe; in Ovid this is replaced by reflexivity - the poem reflects a cosmos made up of previous literature, including Aratus and Aratean scholarship. Or (to use the image we have been given) the Sphere of Archimedes, which in Ciceronian philosophy was used to illustrate the 32 Most of the material in Maass is late or undated, making it difficult to make definitive pronouncements. One can say that Ovid may have been using a similar collection of scholia and isagogic works. There were many such commentaries on Aratus in existence, at least from the time of Hipparchus (c. 190 B.C.). Jean Martin ( 1 956a xi-xx; cf. 1 956b) believes it is likely that even the earliest manuscripts had an attached corpus of scholia. That Ovid may have used such commentaries is made more plausible by the technique of his Aratean predecesor Cicero, who seems to have interpolated some material from the commentators into his translation of Aratus, the Aratea (Soubiran (1972) 93). The very fact that Cicero could deploy his translation of Aratus as part of his exegesis in the Stoic book of the De natura deorum (see further below), with transitional glosses binding the poem to its Stoic context, argues for the importance of Stoicizing commentaries in Roman readings of Aratus. 33 See Hunter (1995) 5-10, 'Cosmic poetry'.</page><page sequence="14">34 EMMA GEE nature of the world, particularly the world as the Stoics saw it, becomes for Ovid an image of the poem's literary cosmos. The sphaera is used by the poet to talk about his project of describing the world. The literary underlay to the rationalizing part of the Vestalia presents us with two different ways of discussing the universe - rationalising and mythological - and incor- porates a tradition of scholarship which allows us to create a resolution between them. In a sense, the sphaera presents a synoptic image of the Aratean literary background to the Fasti. At the same time, the temple is an imago mundi , as is Homer's Shield of Achilles in Iliad 18: a synoptic view of the cosmos.34 Its circular ground-plan can allude to a sphere, the shape of the universe. Like the Sphere of Archimedes the temple is a microcosm of the mundus ,35 I propose to discuss in this section how Ovid's image of the world works as an image of the poem, and how this functions to break down the binary opposition between Aratus' poem as a direct description of the universe, and Ovid's poem as a reflexive artistic entity. Nature and art share a rational basis. Cicero seems to express this parallelism when he describes the universe and its model using identical diction in the second book of the De natura deorum36 On the larger scale, ideas of art and rationality act as the fulcrum of the Stoic world view as we have it in the second book of Cicero's De natura deorum . It is possible to see the following analogy as underlying all the philosophical argumentation in A.D. 2: (i) God exists, and his rationality is evident in the world (ii) This may be proven by analogy with the rationality of man as illustrated in art (take something like a model sphere, for example). One way of interpreting the structure of the whole second book of the De natura deorum is to see it as a series of parallel and cumulative illustrations of this nature/art analogy. The sphaera is one of these illustrations. In N.D. 2.87 the conclusion of arguments in favour of divine providence does double duty as the proposition which leads to the Sphere of Archimedes: si igitur meliora sunt ea quae natura quam illa quae arte perfecta sunt, nec ars efficit quicquam sine ratione, ne natura quidem rationis expers est habenda. The analogy between art and nature is made explicit here by the repetition of ars and ratio. 34 Hardie (1985). 35 Hardie (1985) 19: 'We remember that in Heraclitus ( Homeric Problems 43ff.) the circular form of the Shield of Achilles alludes to the spherical universe'. This provides an answer to the problem, articulated above, of how the shape of the temple can reflect the shape of world. 36 Compare A.D. 2. 8 8 (the sphere) with A.D. 2.81, 85, 87, 128, 140, 142, 155 (the world). Sollertia and ratio are the two terms which recur most often in Cicero's descriptions of art and of the ordering activity of a providential Nature.</page><page sequence="15">OVID' S VESTALIA AND THE PHAENOMENA OF ARATUS 35 This proposition generates a series of exempla , both direct and indirect, of human ratio as revealed by various arts.37 The direct illustrations are statuary and painting, the art of navigation, and time-keeping (a horologium and a klepsydra , both of which tell the time arte non casu ). The indirect exempla begin with the sphaerai of Posidonius and Archimedes at 2.88, which we have discussed above. Cicero (Balbus) then proceeds at A.D. 2. 104-15 to quote the Aratea, Cicero's own translation of Aratus' Phaenomena. In other words, the metaphor for the ordo and ratio of the universe changes from its geometric modelling by art, as exemplified by the sphere, to poetic artistry, exemplified by Aratus (Latinized). Now the celestial order is encapsulated inside a poem in the illustration of divine ratio , and the poem is thus, as it functions within the Stoic argument, parallel to the sphaera. Both, like Ovid's temple of Vesta, are images of the universe - art at the microcosmic level expressing the art of the macrocosm. If we look again at Cicero, Republic 1.21-2, we shall see that collapse of the distinction between the art of the universe and the art of the poem is already implicit in Aratus' Phaenomena . We remember that, in Rep. 1.22, Cicero's speaker seemed to be telling us that Aratus wrote a work which was a kind of poetic rendition of, or commentary on, a model globe made by Eudoxus; yet Aratus' extant work, the Phaenomena , shows no outward sign of being a description of a work of art rather than of the universe itself. Modern commentators disagree among themselves: 'Aratus of Soli . . . wrote a didactic poem on astronomy, entitled Phaenomena . . . This does not, however, contain any description of the sphere in question'.38 And conversely: 'The poem referred to is the Phaenomena , translated into Latin by Cicero in his youth'.39 This problem is compounded by the fact that Cicero, Rep. 1.22, is both the only mention of the existence of a sphaera of Eudoxus (although the attribution to him, as one of the founding fathers of geocentric astronomy, of such a device is natural), and the only association of such a sphaera with the poet Aratus. What are the possibilities? Firstly, that the description of Eudoxus' sphaera occurred in one of Aratus' many works not now extant. Secondly, that in Cicero's mind an assim- ilation may have taken place between Eudoxus' literary work as a source for Aratus and the idea of a model sphere as an aid to reading the work (just as in the manuscript tradition of certain astronomical works maps and drawings of the constellations are provided). The second hypothesis is rendered more plausible by the threefold meaning of the word acpaiQa - the globe or sphere as a geometric figure, the starry sphere of the heavens, and a shorthand name for literary works describing this starry sphere. The Roman astrologer Nigidius Figulus (98^-5 B.C.) wrote works entitled Sphaera Graecanica and Sphaera Barbarica .40 Both of Eudoxus' literary works, the 37 The same nexus as in De natura deorum 2, between the world picture and various artistic exempla of it - ships and temples - is found at De orat. 3. 178-80. 38 Dijksterhuis (1987) 24 n. 2. 39 Keyes (1928) 42. 4U Servius on Georgie s 1.19, 43, 218.</page><page sequence="16">36 EMMA GEE Phaenomena and the Enoptron , which the ancient biographies, introductory treatises and commentaries cite as the model for Aratus' versification,41 were such descriptions of the sphaera and may have gone by that 'nickname'. It is not impossible that confusion could have arisen from Cicero' s reading of a collection of scholia and interpretative nuggets such we have in Maass' edition of 1898. Consider for example Achilles' initial description of Aratus' Phaenomena : xfļv òè Oaivopevcov è^f|YT|Oiv jtQcoxov pèv éoxd)ôT1ç xfjç acpaÍQaç, pexà ôè xaõxa xivoupévqç êjToif|ôaxo "Aqcxxoç;.42 This must refer to the first two parts of Aratus' description of the universe (ocpaiQa) in his Phaenomena , the so-called 'Phainomena' and the 'Sunanatolai': first he 'maps' the stars and constellations in the sky, then he describes their risings and settings in relation to one another. But the words might equally be taken as referring to Aratus writing about a model globe, first as it stood, then as it was when moved. Literary work, universe and model globe could all be expressed by the same term - ocpaiQa. The French scholar of historical astronomy, Germaine Aujac, resolved the problem in a different way; she agrees with Cicero that Eudoxus was the first to represent the constellations on a solid ball which was a model of the starry sphere, and advances the theory that Eudoxus' Phaenomena was a description of the model globe: 'Eudoxe de Cnide aurait été le premier, dit Cicerón (Rep. 1.21), à représenter les constellations sur une sphère solide, image de la sphère étoilée. Son ouvrage les Phénomènes en était une sorte de description' 43 This is an attractive theory: Aratus' poem was a versification of a work by Eudoxus which itself described a model sphere. If, then, we read Aratus' work, the Phaenomena , as eliding the distinction between the literary and the artistic in such a way, this collapses the two poles of the Stoic argument for divine rationality, which, we recall, were as follows: (i) God exists and his rationality is evident in the world (ii) This must be so because the rationality of man as evident in art (one example of which is an armillary sphere) is indisputable. The two arms of the analogy are now implicit in Aratus' work, rather than explicit: his description of the world as made by a rational divine creator is the same as his description of a work of art made by a rational craftsman, Eudoxus. The universe and its model are assimilated, rather than the second being used as an image for the first. Implicit in this is a congruent assimilation between literature and the cosmos. Now we see that the 'universe' that Aratus is mapping in the Phaenomena is actually at one remove, mediated through either the literary works, or the model sphaera , of Eudoxus. The fact that Aratus was not himself an observer makes his world a poetic one. His poem is not directly reflective of the universe but can exist as a closed system, art relating to art, not to reality - a xóopoç èjtécov.44 41 See Attālus, Maass (1898) 23^t; Achilles, ibid. 77-8. Anonymus 2, ibid. 149, however, is clear about the literary nature of Aratus' source, referring to it as xò Enòó^ou ctúyyQOW01- 42 Maass (1898) 80. 43 Aujac (1979) 38. 44 The phrase is coined from Democntus verdict on Homer, rr.

The scholiast introduces his artistic image at the point of embarkation on Aratus' representation of the world and at the beginning of his rendition of Eudoxus' Sphaera. For the scholiast to quote Homer's Shield of Achilles at this point is for him to comment on the parallelism between art and nature, providing an artistic synopsis of Aratus' astro- nomical poem, through the pre-existing analogy between Shield and universe, and through the reader's recall of the constellations engraved on the Shield: èv [lèv yaiav èxeuî;', èv ó' oŮQavóv, èv ôè dakaooav , f|8À,ióv x' áxápavxa oeÀ,f|vr|v xe jr)aļ0ouaav, èv ôè xà xeÍQea Jtávxa, xá x' oÚQavòç èoxeqpávooxai, nAj1iáôaç 0' eYáôaç xe xó xe o0évoç 'Qqúovoç "Aqxxov 0', fļv xai "Ap-a^av 8mxX,r]aiv xaÀiouoiv, fļ x' auxou oxQeqpexai xai x 'QQÍoova ôoxeúei, oiq ô' áppoQÓç èaxi XoexQtòv 'QxeavoTo. (IL 18.483-9) The circular shield of Achilles 'stands in' for the spherical model of the universe, in acting as its artistic analogue. And Aratus' poem bears the same relation to the universe as the Shield or the sphaera : they are all, as the scholiast puts it, xóopou pipf|paxa. In Aratus' poem, the artistic analogue briefly detaches itself from the purported first- hand description of the universe, in the simile of a craftsman at Ph. 529-33: ou xcv 'A0r1vaiT1ç %eiQ(òv ôeôiôaypévoç ávqç äXkr'i KoXkr'oaiTO xuÀxvôópeva xQoxáX,8ia xotá xe xai xóaa jtávxa jt8QiocpaiQr|ôòv è^íoacov, obç xá y' èvai08Qia jtXxxyíxoi auvaQqQÓxa xúxkcm è£ f|oi3ç èjti vúxxa ôiobxexai rjpaxa Jtávxa.

The image of the poem, as in Cicero's De natura deorum , is parallel with the image of the sphere. 45 Maass (1898) 343.</page><page sequence="18">38 EMMA GEE If Aratus' Craftsman meditates on the activity of translating Eudoxus, and ultimately on the ordering of the universe in poetic diction, then one might say that, in Ovid, the globe of Archimedes, meditates on the act of translating Aratus. Its literary background allows the sphere to act not just as an image of the cosmos but as an abstract repre- sentation of Aratus' poem and its attached Stoic interpretative tradition. The fact that the sphere is placed in the problematic context of the Vestalia might symbolize the difficulty of 'translation' of the Aratean stars, and Greek scientific didactic, into the Roman calendar, which is part of Ovid's project in the Fasti. Conclusion I have discussed three elements in the 'rationalizing' section of Ovid's Vestalia {Fasti 6.267-304): the Sphere of Archimedes, the world picture it represents (in conjunction with the circular Temple of Vesta), and the Hesiodic cosmogony of lines 285-8. The conjunction of these three elements connects Ovid's Vestalia at this point with Stoic cosmological exegesis and allegory, particularly as it is found in Cicero's De natura deorum and in the Aratean scholiastic tradition. The combination of elements shows Ovid in Stoicizing philosophical mode, and may show in addition that he was aware of the Stoicizing tradition of commentary on Aratus' Phaenomena. One could say that the Temple of Vesta is an abstract repre- sentation of the Aratean background to the stars in the Fasti. Through it, Ovid meditates on his project: the incorporation of the Aratean stars into the Roman festival year. The sphaera functions as an image of the world, and is also an image of the poem. For this we have a possible precedent in Aratus' own project, the versification of Eudoxus' Sphaera : a precedent for the collapse of the distinction between art and nature as it was seen particularly in the second book of Cicero's De natura deorum. The strands of my argument can best be summed up by reference to an earlier work of Cicero, the De oratore. At De oratore 3. 178, Cicero gives the world picture precisely as we see it in De natura deorum 2 and in Ovid's Vestalia : the central, balanced earth inside the spherical revolving universe.46 But in the context of the De oratore this ideal world order is used as an analogy for verbal art, for decorum in the use of words, which sicut mollis simam ceram ad nostrum arbitriumformamus etfingimus {De orat. 3.177). Here verbal art is primary, and the parallel analogies for it are the world order, the formam et figuram of the body (3.179), trees (179), ships (180), and temples, which are constructed according to the principles not just of beauty but of necessity, ut etiamsi in caelo capitolium statueretur ubi imber esse non posset , nullam sine fastigio dignitatem habiturum fuisse uideatur (180). The word figura {Fasti 6.278, De orat. 3.179) is itself polysémie. It can mean a geometrical figure, as at Cicero, N.D. 2.47: quid ... pulchrius ea figura (i.e. sphaera ) 46 Quoted in n. 19.</page><page sequence="19">OVID' S VESTALIA AND THE PHAENOMENA OF ARATUS 39 quae sola omnis alias figuras complexa continet . . .? Likewise it signifies an image or likeness, as in Fasti 6.278, parua figura poli. But it is also a 'form' in grammar (formas uocabulorum , Varro, L.L. 9.55), and in rhetoric a figure or trope - any oblique mode of expression, including perhaps that of allegory (Cicero, De oratore 3 .212, figuram orationis). Linquamus naturam , artesque uideamus : Ovid's parua figura poli can be both his imago mundi , and the image of his poem and how it functions in relation to its linguistic and literary cosmos, a cosmos whose structures are formed, partially at least, out of Aratus and the writers in the Stoicizing Aratean tradition.
