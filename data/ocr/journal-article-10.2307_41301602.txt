Pp. xiv, 156. $35.00. Laura Brown's Homeless Dogs and Melancholy Apes is short but wide- ranging; it addresses works by authors as diverse as Cervantes and Paul Auster. Her focus, however, is on the eighteenth century, when, as she argues, "a novel engagement with animal-kind" emerged (x). For Brown, the discovery of the hu- manoid ape and the concurrent rise of widespread bourgeois pet keeping created new ways of thinking about animals and therefore also new ways of thinking about humans. The book emerged out of an undergraduate course she taught on pets, in which she and her students found that the dominant paradigms for thinking about human-animal relationships were inadequate to explain the complex representa- tions of animals in literary texts. Her first chapter thus addresses the scholarship that presents these paradigms - "the contrasting positions of anthropomorphism or alterity" (2) - and explains why she sees them as insufficient. Instead of this simple binary, she says, "the representations of animal-kind in the literary culture of this period offer a diverse range of formal, thematic, rhetorical, and generic innova- tions that resemble each other not in their adherence to either a human-alienating or human-associated perspective, but in their dissonance - in their tendency to surprise, to invert, to challenge, or to experiment with expected modes of order and stable structures of meaning" (16-17). This idea of dissonance is central to the readings she presents in the rest of the work. Each of the remaining four chapters focuses on a significant motif in the creation of the modern literary representation of animals: the humanoid ape, the lady's lapdog, the pet monkey, and the dog narrator. The themes of the chapters</page><page sequence="2">554 Eighteenth -Century Studies Vol. 44, No. 4 overlap, with particular attention given to the presence of disruption, surprise, and inversion. In each chapter, Brown focuses on a few key texts in order to explore the ways in which representations of animals complicate ideas about human nature. The impossibility of clearly defining boundaries between human and nonhuman animals, and, conversely, the possibility of affection and communication between species, form recurring themes in her study, which she develops through the close reading of both canonical and lesser-known works of the eighteenth century and beyond. Chapter 2, on the humanoid ape, examines the ways in which the ape forms a "mirror" for humans. Here Brown focuses in particular on Edward Ty- son's enormously influential Anatomy of a Pygmie and Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels: "for the English eighteenth century, Tyson's pygmy is the empirical record, and Swift's Yahoo the canonical literary representation, of the discovery of the great ape" (47). Through this mirror, people's sense of human distinctiveness was challenged. For some, the ape could offer a reassuring sense of the achievement of humans in reaching the heights of civilization, whereas for others it was a disturb- ing reminder of the beast lurking beneath the surface of humanity. The third chapter, "Immoderate Love," examines the image of "the lady and the lapdog," the distinctive eighteenth-century representation of pet keeping. The "immoderate love" at issue is thus the love of a woman for her pet, which raises the possibility of other forms of excessive or transgressive affection. According to Brown, this image fostered "a literary form that expresses the encounter with difference through a rhetoric of sudden inversion - in which ideas of alterity are instantly transformed into experiences of intimacy" (65). The characteristic literary move represented by the figure of the lady and the lapdog, Brown argues, is the forcible association of disparate concepts: human and animal, male and female, superior and subordinate. In early eighteenth-century satire, lapdogs are presented as both sexual partners and symbols of female sexual excess. By the mid-nineteenth century, Brown suggests, this image had lost its sexualized connotations. Yet the notion of interspecies love continued to call into question the boundaries of spe- cies, gender, and class. The central questions developed in chapters 2 and 3 reappear in the final two chapters of the book, on images of pet monkeys and the rise of novels fea- turing canine narrators. In chapter 4, much like the humanoid ape, the monkey creates comparisons between men and apes, while the monkey as woman's pet is sexualized in ways similar to the lapdog. Chapter 5 again returns to questions of human uniqueness, focusing on the fictional dog narrator's ability to understand and communicate with humans. By the nineteenth century, as with the figure of the lady and the lapdog, satire had been replaced by sentiment and moralizing, but, Brown argues, in all dog narratives, "species difference calls human nature into question" (123). The recurring theme of Brown's work, then, is how literary representa- tions of animals make it possible for humans to think in new ways about what it means to be human. In some cases, the questioning leads to ontological crises, as in Swift's depiction of the Yahoos, who represent the worst form of humanity, or in suggestions of human-animal love through the lapdog and the monkey. For Brown, it is no coincidence that such disruptive imaginings frequently focus on pet animals; for her, the practice of pet keeping, with its visible affection across species lines, was central in transforming ideas about human nature. These ideas cannot be confined to categories of anthropomorphism or alterity; according to Brown, not only is it possible for both concepts to be present simultaneously in a</page><page sequence="3">Single Title Reviews 555 text, but those concepts also fail to encompass the many ways in which modern literary depictions of animals transform human thought. The sheer scope of this work, from early modern natural history to contemporary posthumanism, from classical to late-twentieth-century literature, is impressive, and it enables the author to sketch out the long-term origins and impact of the changes she observes in the eighteenth century. Yet this breadth, along with the brevity of the book, makes it impossible for Brown to trace any single phenomenon in much detail. She wisely chooses to focus on a few key texts as examples of the trends she discusses, but this choice inevitably raises the ques- tion of how widespread these ideas actually were. Moreover, although the work persuasively claims a unique role for literary representations, this historian was left wishing for more attention to their social and cultural impact: did the ontological crises and boundary-breaking she identifies in literary sources transform thinking about animals and humans beyond the literary realm? Nevertheless, Brown's book is an important addition to the rapidly growing field of animal studies. Her central point about the need to broaden our way of conceptualizing human thinking about animals beyond the anthropomorphism/alterity dichotomy is extremely valuable, and the close textual readings she presents open many interesting new avenues for exploring the role of animals in human thought.</page></plain_text>
