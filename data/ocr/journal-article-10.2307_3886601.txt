<plain_text><page sequence="1">AUSTRALIAN AND SOUTH AFRICAN ROCK-ART COMPARED A. R. WILLCOX Australian Aboriginal Rock-Art (Australian Museum, Sydney) by Frederick D. McCarthy, the Curator of Anthropology, provides us with the most comprehensive and lavishly illustrated study of its subject which has yet appeared. Engravings and painting, in all its variations, are discussed and what is known of the techniques of execution, paints and purposes. The book greatly facilitates comparison of the Australian rock-art with our own in South Africa. Such a comparative study cannot fail to be illuminating and a few preliminary observations are offered here. The author classifies the subjects into six main groups: (1) Anthropomorphic; including human and spiritual beings. (2) Mythological (other than human) creatures. (3) Fauna. (4) Material culture (implements, weapons, ritual and other objects). (5) Geometric. (6) Indeterminate figures (identifiable only by the local natives). This classification might cover South African rock- art, but in order of importance we would change the sequence to 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 6, and of course have to make our own guesses about the 'indeterminate figures'. We note the curious rarity of plant life and the absence of scenery as subjects. Both are extremely rare in the Union, though trees and other plants are fairly common in Rhodesia. Mr. McCarthy accounts for the rarity of plants as subjects by their being 'in the domain of the women' and hence outside that of the men who, in Australia and as far as we know here also, were the authors of the paintings. This could be the reason for the same rarity in the rock-art of South Africa (and the Palaeolithic art of Europe), but, among the Bushmen at least, those plants which provided poisons, medicine and perhaps paint materials, fell within the province of the men. To compare first the petroglyphs, a common method in Australia of outlining was by making over- lapping punctures in the rock surface, but petroglyphs include also scratched or abraded outlines and pecked intaglios as ours do. These are executed on a wider range of stones, including quartzite, basalt, slate and limestone, and occur not only on open sites as in South Africa, but also in caves, as ours do not. The range of size of Australian engravings is much greater, some being as long as 60 ft. (18 m.). As to their age the latest were apparently done within the last century; the age of the oldest is the subject of much debate and it is perhaps significant in this regard that although some animals and birds have become extinct since the Aborigines arrived in Australia no such creatures have been with certainty identified as the subjects of petroglyphs. The same difficulties of dating present themselves there as here; patination of the cut surfaces has been shown not to be a reliable guide to age. Rock-paintings occur in great quantity in rock shelters and include monochromes, bichromes and polychromes, the commonest colours being red, white, black and yellow - all as in South Africa. The sources of the pigments were mainly ochres for the red and yellow, charcoal and manganese for the black, white from pipeclay, gypsum, or burnt selenite. Blue, which rather rarely appears, is stated in one area to be from 'an ochre', and in another area, according to Professor A. P. Elkin, to be from glauconite. A blue-grey colour, also rarely, appears in South African rock- paintings: its origin is unknown. The Australian rock-painters used dry pigments like a stick of chalk. They also made paints by mixing these with water, with animal or fish-fat, or, in one area, with orchid (Dendrobium) juice. In South Africa there is no evidence for the use of dry pigments or water-paints. Animal fats and plant saps or juices were fairly certainly used as media. Other possibilities, for which there is less evidence, are blood, urine, honey, and egg-white. The Australian methods of application were by the fingers or whole hand, a brush made of a twig chewed and teased out at the end, or feathers tied on to the end of a stick. The Bushmen on the other hand often used a brush made from animal's hair or a single small feather, which may be one reason for the greater fineness and delicacy of their painting. A development peculiar to Australia was the so- called 'X-ray painting' showing the bones and internal organs of an animal. The shading, modelling, and foreshortening of our South African rock-paintings are completely absent. A technique not known here with certainty was stencilling by holding an object against the rock face and blowing pigment from the mouth, or from a sheet of bark around the object, leaving a silhouette. The commonest subject of the stencil method was the human hand. This was also represented by daubing paint on the hand and impressing it on the rock face. These hand-imprints occur plentifully throughout Australia. Similar examples are found in France, Spain, in South America, and in South Africa. Such wide-spread and abundant distribution of hand-imprints indicates no mere idle whim on the part of the innumerable artists who made them, but rather an intuitive understanding of what their human kind owed to the possession of this flexible instrument of their minds. It seems not too much to say that the hand made Man. They felt their own individual hands to be the most distinctive part of them; in every way a fitting signature to the work those hands had wrought. 97</page><page sequence="2">As in South Africa paintings are often superimposed on others to the detriment of both layers. It is odd that the later artist did not either first apply a wash of paint to obscure the paintings already there, and provide a clean primed 'canvas' for his own, or else efface the earlier work by rubbing down the surface. That they did not do either in Australia, as well as here, is some confirmation of the suggestion I have made elsewhere that there was a taboo on the removal or complete obscurement of another artist's work, but not on painting over it. The age of the oldest paintings is undetermined but must be many centuries. Rock-painting is still practised by the Aborigines in central and northern Australia. Engraving seems to be no longer done but one tribe, at least, practised both arts. There is certainly no need to assume that the engravers and painters were different tribes or even different artists. As to motivation, hunting magic played its part, but the Australian art is more closely integrated with religion, mythology, and social customs, than was the case with Bushman art. Mythical creatures like the C Mimi, Wandgina and Malindji are commonly depicted. One especially important conclusion emerges, I think, from this brief comparative study. The close resemblance between Bushman paintings and some of those in Europe-especially in eastern Spain-is generally admitted. It has been argued, however, against the diffusionist view that primitive people in the same stage of culture using similar paints applied to rock surfaces for presumably similar purposes, must produce paintings very much alike. The Austra- lian rock-art shows that this is not so. Except perhaps for some of the Mimi stick-figures, the Australian paintings are quite unlike in style any in Europe or southern Africa. The South American paintings also are unlike the Eur-African group. Mr. McCarthy himself states that the cave-art of Europe is approached only by the Bushmen. The belief is therefore strength- ened that the Bushmen painters were the inheritors of the artistic tradition of the palaeolithic artists of Europe, whereas the cave-art of Australia seems wholly autochthonous.</page></plain_text>
