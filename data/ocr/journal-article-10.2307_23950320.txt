<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHRIST AS THE ΑΡΧΗ OF CREATION. (Prov. viii 22, Col. i 15-18, Rev. iii 14.) The main object of this paper is to point out the fact—hitherto, I believe, unnoticed—that in Col. i 16-18 St Paul is giving an elaborate exposition of the first word in Genesis, בראשית Berishiih, and interpret ing rishith as referring to Christ. This interpretation depends, as we shall see, upon an inferred connexion between rishith of Gen. i 1 and the same term applied to Wisdom personified in Prov. viii 2 2, ידווה יןנני ראשית די־כודי־כו Adonai kanant rishith darko—a passage to which there is obvious reference in -πρωτότοκο·; ■πάσης κτίσεως in Col. i 15. Since the interpretation of Prov. viii 22 has raised greater controversy than that of almost any other passage in the Ο. T., and is still in some degree un settled, we shall do well to begin with a discussion of it. Interpretation Interpretation of Prov. viii 22. The renderings of A.V. and R.V. are identical: The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, Before his works of old. R.V., however, adds the marginal alternatives ' formed ' for ' possessed', ' as' (the beginning) for ' in' (the beginning),' The first of' for ' Before'. Meaning Meaning of רןנני. In the first place, the fact needs emphasis that the verb גןנה kana always seems to possess the sense 'get, acquire', never the sense 'possess,'possess, own' simply, apart from the idea of possessing something which has has has been acquired in one way or another. This clearly appears from examination of the usages of the verb in Hebrew, and through com parison of the cognate languages. There are (if my computation is correct) 88 occurrences of the verb in the Hebrew Bible and the Hebrew text of Ecclesiasticus. The various shades of meaning which it has may be classified as follows :— 1.

Whether kind, here has the sense 'beget' or 'create' is ambiguous. If the former, the name is analogous to the frequent proper names com pounded with אב ,db ' father' in reference to the Deity, e. g. Abiel ' My Father is God', Abijah ' My Father is Yah' (cf. in Babylonian such names as Samas-abum 'The Sun-god is father', Sin-abusu 'The Moon god is his father'); if the latter, we may compare El'asa,' Asahel ' God made' (sc. the bearer of the name), 'Asaiah ' Yah made', Ya'asiel 'Yah maker' (cf. in Babylonian the frequent names compounded with bant bant ' creator ', e. g. Anum-bani, Sin-bani, SamaS-bani ' The god Anu or or Sin or Samas is creator', Uusu-bani ' His god is creator', Ilusu-ibni ' His god created', Ilusu-ibnisu 'His god created him'.') Elkana in O.T. is the name of several persons, being borne by the father of Samuel (1 Sam. if), one of David's warriors (1 Chr. xii 6), a high official in the time of Ahaz (2 Chr. xxviii 7), a son of Korah (Exod. vi 24), and several Levites (1 Chr. vi 8, 10, 11, 20, 21, ix 16, xv 23). The repeated occur rence of the name over a widespread period is important as proving that the verb קנה in the sense ' beget' or ' create' was well known in popular usage, and not an uncommon usage as might be inferred from the few cases which we are able to cite (kana verb 4 and 5, and kinydn subst. 4). In face of this evidence we must surely conclude that the ground meaning of kana is that of acquiring something not previously possessed, which may be done by buying or making it, in the case of a child by begetting begetting it, in the case of wisdom by accumulating it through mental application. The single instance of the verb in the sense ' own' (Isa. i 3), in which there seems to be no perceptible stress upon the act of acquiring, is no evidence in proof that kana ever means to possess in a sense which excludes the idea of previous acquisition. The ox of the passage in question is far from being inseparable from the man who owns it. There was a time when it did not belong to him ; therefore, when Hebrew speaks of its owner, it uses a term which properly means ' he who has acquired it קנהי) י). This is also true of the substantival forms derived from kana which bear the sense of property or possessions. The underlying idea is always that of acquired property. The Hebrew kana,kana, in fact, in so far as it contains the idea of possessing, is exactly like the Greek κτάομαι (in the perfect), and the substantives derived from it like κτήμα. A man's money, furniture, children, knowledge, are 1 Cf. instances of these names cited in Thureau-Dangin Lettres et Contrats de de Vepoque de la Premiere Dynastie babylonienne.</page><page sequence="4">NOTES AND STUDIES 163 kinyanimkinyanimkinyanim or κτήματα because he has come to possess them ; his legs and arms, for example, are not kinyanim or κτήματα because they are in separable from our idea of him as a complete man—there never was a time when he did not possess them. Of course if we shifted our point of view, and regarded the man as a pre-existing spiritual entity subsequently endowed with a body, we might think of his body as a kinydn or κτήμα, since thus the body and its members would be pictured as acquired property. Evidence Evidence from the cognate languages as to the meaning of ׳ijij. This conclusion as to the ground-conception of the verb קנה in Biblical Hebrew is borne out by the usage of the same root in the cognate languages. In New Hebrew the meaning of קנה ,קני is 'acquire, buy', and also 'create'. Cf. Rosh ha-shana $1 a, בראשון מה היו אומרין לה' הארץ על ׳ ,שם שקנה והקנה ושליט בעולמו On the first day what (Psalm) do they recite ? " The earth is the Lord's " (Ps. xxiv); because He created His world and gave it in possession, and is ruler over it.' Here קנה והקנה means literally ' acquired (by creation) and caused (men) to acquire (it)'. Cf. other instances of the use of the verb in Levy Neuheb. u. chald. Wiirterbuch,Wiirterbuch, s.v. Aramaic קנא, Syriac Joo kena corresponds in usage precisely with Hebrew. The O.T. occurrences of Hebrew kind are regularly repro duced by fna in the Targums and the Peshitta,1 and in addition Heb. רכש רכש rdkash 'gather property' is rendered by kend in the Aramaic versions (Gen. xii 5, xxxi 18, xxxvi 6, xlvi 6), and ׳ ו־ביש(gathered) property' normally by kinyana (niksin ' riches', segul/d ' treasure' also occur as renderings). The N.T. and patristic occurrences of Ue exhibit the same usage (cf. Payne Smith Thesaurus, s.v.). Arabic Li hand means ' to acquire' (e. g. sheep or goats) for a per manent possession, not for sale (Lane, Supplement to Diet.), and in conjugation VIII ' to possess' property so acquired. The verb may also have the sense 'create' (Kamus, p. 1937, »ili. *1)1 tLi). In Sabaean votive inscriptions the causative הקני haknt is the regular term for ' dedicate', i. e. ' cause to acquire'; cf. CIS. iv nos. 2', 3', 30', 37S 752. 77-91. &amp;c. In ib.ib.ib.ib. no. 37s we find the simple stem, . . . ועבדהו ... דקני ועסי, 'and his riparian property . . . which he acquired and made'. The subst. קני means 'property '; ib. nos. 3s, 29', 371. 1 Exceptions are Prov. viii 3 2, where both Targ. and Pesh. use the verb ברא י created' (see below on the Versions), and Deut. xxxii 6 where Targ. Onkelos para phrases קנך ' who begat thee' by ןאך1 דיליה ' and thou art His', doubtless in order to obviate the anthropomorphism of the original.

In Babylonian the verb kand seems to be infrequent. Meissner, however, quotes two instances of it (Supplement, p. 85); amar sa abda [z'«a] si/li sarri ik-nu-u-ni intas, ' All that my father acquired under the protection of the king he has taken away' (K. nor, 16; Harper Letters no. 152); ekle kiri tiise sa ina silli'a ik-nu-u, ' The fields, gardens, (and) slaves which under my protection they acquired' (BA. 2, 566, 24). Here we might perhaps render ' owned' in place of' acquired'; yet still the reference would be to the owning of wealth acquired during a period of prosperity. Importance Importance of recognizing that the sense ' acquire' is inseparable from from 5ןנה. The evidence adduced above as to the meaning of band is familiar to competent Hebrew scholars, and the conclusion which we have drawn as to its invariable ground-conception would hardly be called in question by them. The reason why it has seemed desirable to marshal the facts in such fullness is that, in the controversy which has raged round לןנכי in Prov. viii 22, they have not been rightly apprehended by theologians, either in the past or in modern times. Thus, for example, Dr Liddon in his Bampton Lectures (Lect. ii, 13th ed. pp. 6r f.) states that 'modern critics know that if we are to be guided by the clear certain sense of the Hebrew root, we shall read " possessed ", and not " created ", and they admit without difficulty that the Wisdom is uncreated by and co-eternal with the Lord Jehovah '.l He adds in a foot-note that ' the current meaning of the word is "to acquire" or "possess", as is proved by its certain sense in the great majority of cases where it is used'. Here it is clear that he fails to recognize the sharp distinction which exists between the meaning 'acquire' and the meaning 'possess' with the force in which he postulates it, viz. ' possess' in a sense which not only ignores the idea of preliminary acquisition, but is actually to be under stood as excluding such an idea. But, if our argument has been sound, this distinction forms the crux of the question. The idea of creation is closely connected with the idea of acquisition as being one form of it; whereas the idea of possession without acquisition stands sharply apart, 1 Similar statements as to the incorrectness of the rendering ' createdand the correctness of ' possessedare made by Newman Select Treatises of St Athanasius ii p. 370; Ottley Incarnation i p. 305.</page><page sequence="6">NOTES AND STUDIES 165 and cannot, as we have seen, be substantiated for a single occurrence of the verb. We are justified, therefore, in concluding that ,?}ζ cannot rightly be rendered ' possessed mebut must have the meaning ' gat me' in some sense still to be determined. Now the idea of buying or acquiring from an an outside source may clearly be excluded without argument, since Wisdom is certainly not pictured as something originally external to God. We thus have to choose between the two meanings ' created' or ' begat'. Does Does Does ,?JjJ mean ' created me' or 1 begat me' ? Meaning Meaning of חיללתי ,נסכתי in following verses. Our decision must be guided by the meaning which we attach to the verbs descriptive of the production of Wisdom in the immediate sequel, Prov. viii 23-25. These are נסכתי nissakti in v. 23, חיללתי holalti twice in w. 24, 25. There is no variation between the renderings of A.V. and R.V. in these verses. 23. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, Or ever the earth was. 24. When there were no depths, I was brought forth; When there were no fountains abounding with water. 25. Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills was I brought forth. Now we observe that, while there is no doubt at all as to the meaning of חיללת׳—' I was brought to the birth' or ' was travailed with', there is is more than a doubt whether נסכתי is correctly rendered ' I was set up'. Though this meaning may be supported by the single occurrence of the verb in Ps. ii 6, נסכתי מלכי ' I have installed my king' (cf. Babylonian nasakunasaku ' appoint'), and by the subst. נסיך nasik ' prince' (Babylonian naszku)',naszku), Josh, xiii 21, Mic. ν 4, Ezek. xxxii 30, Ps. lxxxiii 12, wecahnot fail to observe that the interpretation of נסכתי in our passage as the Niph'al of this verb involves an unnatural hysteron-proteron, the official installation of Wisdom being mentioned prior to the repeated figure of the birth-pangs which produced it. We notice further that נסכתי might be the Niph'al of another root נסך &lt; to weave' (Arabic nasaga), which occurs in Isa. xxv 7, xxx 1 (probably), and in the subst. מסכה masseka, מסכת masseketh., 'web, piece of woven stuff'; or, it might be Niph'al of the related סכך sakak, 'interweave' (whence New Heb. הסיך 'weave'), of the form which is illustrated by Gesenius-Kautzsch Heb. Gram. §67§67 u (נחל from חלל, Ezek. xxii 16, xxv 3; נחר from חרר, Ps. lxix 4, cii 4, &amp;c.).</page><page sequence="7">166 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES Now there are two O.T. passages in which this verb ׳&amp;בך) סכך) is applied to the weaving of the embryonic body in the womb, the thought being of the mysterious interlacing (as it were) of bones, sinews, and veins, as appears from the passage Job χ 11. ע1ר וב^ר תלבישני תלבישני ...... τ τ ובעצמות ונירים רמ1בכני: With skin and flesh didst Thou clothe me; With bones and sinews didst Thou weave me. (So R.V. rightly, ' knit me togetherA.V. wrongly, ' fenced me', marg.marg. 'hedged'). The other passage is Ps. cxxxix 13. כי־אתה קנית כליתי תסכני בבטן אפי: For Thou didst form my reins ; Thou didst weave me in my mother's womb. (Α.V., R.V. text wrongly ' didst cover me'; R.V. marg, rightly, ' didst knit me together'). The meaning of 1 1תס3?י didst weave me' is further illustrated by v. 15 רקמתי rukkamtt, '1 was skilfully wrought' or 'embroideredthe figure being that of the working of a piece of tapestry (רקסי״ rikma, Judg. ν 30, &amp;c.). Conclusion Conclusion that VQ means 1begat me If, then, in Prov. viii 23 (stage 2) נסכתי means '1 was woven' (pre natal growth of the embryo),1 and in vv· 24, 25 (stage 3) חיללתי means י I was brought forth with travail' (birth), the inference is obvious that the figure described in 2 2 .ש by (stage 1) נןנני is ׳ beget me' (act of pro creation). We notice that Job χ ίο—the verse which immediately precedes the passage which we have discussed as referring to embryonic growth—runs, Hast Thou not poured me out like milk, And curdled me like cheese ? Here, without a doubt, the figure is that of (a) procreation, and (I) con ception (cf. Gray and Ball ad loc., and for the idea underlying (V) Wisd. vii 2 raytls iv αΓ/χατι with Goodrick's note). Thus this long discussion brings us, with close approximation to cer tainty, to the conclusion that יהוה קנני means ' The Lord begat me'. 1 This is the view of Hitrig, Ewald, Zockler, Frankenberg, Toy.</page><page sequence="8">NOTES AND STUDIES 167 Interpretation of Interpretation of ראשית דרכו כןדם מפ?ליו. Passing on to consider the rival interpretations of ראשית ךךכי «the beginning of His way' as (1) an adverbial accusative 'in the beginning of His way' (A.V., R.V, text), or (2) a direct accusative in apposition to the object of ,?}ζ, י as the beginning of His way' (R.V. margin), we note that an adverbial usage of רא^ית is never elsewhere found in O.T.,1 ' in the beginning' being regularly expressed by prefix of the preposition ב (Gen. i r; Jer. xxvi 1, xxvii 1, xxviii r, xlix 34). The absence of a parallel for such a usage cannot, however, be greatly pressed ; since the adverbial usage is well illustrated with other substantives,' and is thus theoretically possible. In particular, we may notice two passages in which the synonymous substantive ותחלה &lt; beginning' seems to be used as an accusative of time: Hos. i 2 ותחיית ך3ר יהוה בהושע ויאמר ןה1ה, lit. ׳ Beginning of Yahweh spake by Hosea, and (= then) Yahweh said', i. e. ' In the beginning of Yahweh's speaking by Hosea, Yahweh said' (the construction is, however, undoubtedly harsh, and some uncertainty attaches to text and interpretation); 2 Sam. xxi 9 KPthibh ותחלת יןציר שעךים ' in the beginning of barley-harvest' (here, however, there exists a Masso retic correction embodied in the kere which inserts the preposition ב ' in' before תחלת). Jerome (Ep. cxl ad Cyprianum) cites the Hebrew of our passage in transliteration with the preposition ב before ראשית, Adonai canani brcsithbrcsith dercho. Since, however, we have no trace of this reading else where, it seems likely that, having decided that the use of ראשית was adverbial, he instinctively substituted בראשית with preposition in citing the passage from memory, because the prepositional usage was natural in this sense to a scholar with a feeling for the language. Such inad vertency would of course have been impossible had it appeared to him that a question of importance turned upon the interpretation of the phrase. This, however, does not seem to have been the case, since his whole interest in the exegesis of the passage centres in postulating for ,?}ζ the meaning ' possedit' rather than ' creavit'. In favour of the interpretation of ראשית דו־כי as a direct accusative in apposition to the object of ,Μζ, we may cite the parallel of Job xl 19, where it is said of Behemoth, הוא ראשית רלבי״אל ' He is the first of God's ways', i. e. the prime fruit of His creative activity. Interpretation of the corresponding phrase in the parallel line, קדט מפעליו, to some extent hangs together with that of ראשית דרכי · an(j thus 1 The statement of Cornelius a Lapide that ראשית is often used for בראיית has no foundation. י Cf. Gesenius-Kautzsch Grammar J 118».</page><page sequence="9">168 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES Α.V., R.V. text, having rendered רא׳^ית רךכי ' in the beginning of His way', gives to the corresponding expression the meaning ' before His works', intending doubtless to obviate the inference that Wisdom is described as one of the created works of God. R.V. margin, on the other hand, parallels the direct accusative *as the beginning of His way' in stichos 1 by a second direct accusative in stichos 2, likewise governed by קנני—' the first of His works יןדם is regularly a substantive denoting that which is in front or fore most,most, whether in place or time. Its interpretation in a prepositional sense, ' before', is unparalleled in Hebrew, and this rendering may be definitely excluded, unless we are prepared to revocalize the word as the Aramaic זקךם an expedient which can hardly be contemplated seriously. The natural interpretation of קרס מפעליי is ' the foremost (in time) of His works', Wisdom being regarded as one of the works of God, though indefinitely anterior to all other works which she was instrumental in calling into being. It would, however, be legitimate to render, ' the antecedent of His works'—a rendering which serves merely to state the priority of Wisdom to the works of God, without necessarily placing her in the same category with them. This rendering appears to be preferable, as preserving a measure of ambiguity which is inherent in the original. Lastly,Lastly,Lastly, מאז, rendered by A.V., R.V. 'of old', and referring, like the expressions which follow in vv. 23-25, to remotest antiquity, is intended to qualify קנני (' begat me of old'), and should therefore be preceded by a comma in the English renderings in order to obviate connexion with ' His works' (as though, ' His works which were of old'). We arrive, then, at the following rendering for the verse as a whole:— The Lord begat me as the beginning of His way, The antecedent of His works, of old. The The Versions.

We find αγοράζίΐν in Ecclus. XXXVli II and yewav in Zech. xiii 5 (Hiph'il).

Ibn Ezra interprets קנני in accordance with the use of the verb in Gen. iv 19, 22 ('create', which is the explanation given by Rashi in Gen.). He explains ראשית ךך3י as meaning first in order among created things, as in the passage in Job xl 19, ' He is the first of God's ways'; and states that קדם מפעליו is the equivalent of קדם לראשית ייךכי being synonymous with ראשית.

Taken absolutely, it may be referred to the mode of generation without change or passion in the Divine Generator3; or, regarded as limited by its close connexion with αρχήν όδων αύτοΰ, it refers, not to the eternal generation of the Son, but to His position in regard to creation, in a sense which practically amounts to ' constituted Me head of crea tion A very general tendency, however, is to accept the rendering 'created' in its ordinary sense, and interpret the passage as prophetic of the Incarnation.3 We find that some few of the Fathers go behind and challenge the LXX rendering of נןנני. First we may notice a group who, though not themselves authorities as to the meaning of the Hebrew, are yet aware of of other Greek translations offering a different rendering, viz. ίκτήσατο. Such are Eusebius,'who refers to Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion; St Epiphanius,7 who mentions the rendering of Aquila; and St Basil8 and St Gregory of Nyssa,9 who speak without specification of 'other 1 Cf.

' We must not', he remarks, ' ignore the fact that other interpreters, who have reached the meaning of the Hebrew more aptly, render ίκτησατό. μ* instead of Ικτισεν. This will offer them [the Arians] the greatest obstacle against the blasphemy of their creaturely interpreta tion. For he who said, "I have gotten a man through God", mani festly used the expression not as the creator of Cain, but as his generator.'1 St Epiphanius similarly cites the parallel usage of ίκτησά μψμην = יןניתי in Gen. iv ι; but then somewhat strangely rejects the explanation on the ground that ίκτησάμην υίόν describes an event which is recent,. whereas in God nothing is recent.® By this׳ objection he presumably means that יןנה = ' beget' properly implies, as in its ordinary sense ' get', the obtaining of something which at one period was unpossessed—and this, if we press the force of the expression, is of course true. The answer is to be found in the consideration that human terminology, framed to describe events happening in time, is inadequate to the description of eternal facts. But objection to the use of רןנה in the sense ' begat' might equally be aimed against the use of the terms ' Father' and ' Son' in view of their human implications, as in the Arian logic. Epiphanius proceeds to express his preference for the strange view that כ!נני js a denominative from the Hebrew IP.' nest', and give it the meaning Ινόσσινσΐ μ(, ' hatched me like a nestling'. Such a denominative would take the form קננני from and not ל!נני from ר!נה · and the verb, which occurs but five times in the Hebrew Bible, means '·to nest', and not 'to hatch'.׳ Epiphanius must presumably have obtained this suggestion from a Jewish source; for we find it appearing in later ages, together with other explanations, in Rashi's commentary on Deut. xxxvi 6 ׳ הל^־היא אביף פ!כך !s not He thy Father that begat thee ?' We come now to St Jerome, who was the first of the Fathers to apply an original knowledge of Hebrew to the elucidation of the passage. In his commentary on Ephesians ii ro (dated by Vallarsi a.d. 388) he is still dependent on the LXX, and applies the rendering ίκτισίν μι to our Lord's Incarnation, arguing that in this respect He 1 Tiarc y* μήν μηδϊ Ικΰνο άπαρασημαντον καταλιττωμίν, οτι άλλοι τStv ίρμηνίων, ot καιριωτ*ρονκαιριωτ*ρον της σημασίας των ,Εβραϊκών καθικόμ(νοι, ίκτησατο μ( άντι του Ικτιαν (κδ(δωκασιν. one ρ μί^ιστον αύτυΐς ίμπόδιον ίσται προς τήν βλασφημιαν του κτίσματος, ο ο yap £Ϊπών, Ικτησάμ ην άνθρωπο ν δια τον θ€0υ, ούχι κτίσας τον Καιν, αλλά ytwyaaiy ταύτη ταύτη ψαίν(ται χρησάμίνος τη φωνη.

' Since Wisdom in the Proverbs of Solomon speaks of herself as created a beginning of the ways of God, and many, through fear lest they should be obliged to call Christ a creature, deny the whole mystery of Christ, and say that not Christ, but the world's wisdom, is meant by this wisdom, we freely declare that there is no hazard in calling Him creature Whom we confess with all confidence of our hope to be " worm ", and " man ", and " crucified ", and "curse".' In his commentary on Micah iv 8, 9, however (assigned to a. d. 392), he has reached another view through study of the Hebrew text: ' et qui ex persona assumpti hominis ait in Proverbiis : Dominus creavit me in principio viarum suarum in opera sua, sive ut in Hebraeo scribitur : Dominus possedit me: can an i enim non creavit me sed possedit me habuitque significatSimilarly in his commentary on Isaiah xxvi Γ3 (assigned to c. a.d. 410) he says, 'Quod quidem et de Sapientia legimus, quae iuxta Hebraicum loquitur in Proverbiis: Deus possedit me initium viarum suarum, licet quaedam exemplaria male pro posses sione habeant creaturamHis strongest expression of opinion as to the interpretation of the verb is found in Ep. cxl ad Cyprianum, where he argues against the meaning י create' for יןנה on the ground that this meaning is expressed by the verb ברא, while יןנה properly means ' possess'. ' Inter possessionem autem et creationem multa diversitas est. Possessio significat, quod semper Filius in Patre et Pater in Filio fuerit. Creatio autem eius, qui prius non erat, conditionis exordium '. This is a meaning for the verb ^—possession, not merely ignoring the conception of preliminary acquisition inherent in the verb, but actually to be understood as excluding it—which, if our argument as to the usage of the verb has been sound, can by no means be sub stantiated ; yet St Jerome's verdict has satisfied subsequent theological thought, and is generally accepted by theologians at the present day. Col. i 15 πρωτότοκος πάσης κτίσεως, a direct allusion to .יהוה כןנני ראשית ךךכוךךכו I turn, now, back to St Paul, whose authority I claim in support of my interpretation of Prov. viii 22. No one can contemplate the rendering which I have, as I hope, substantiated for יהוד! כ!נני ראשית דךבי ׳ The Lord begat me as the beginning of His way' (i. e. His creative activity) without perceiving that πρωτότοκος πάχτης κτίσιως ' the first begotten of all creation ' can hardly be other than a direct reference to the Ο. T. passage. This conclusion, which at first I supposed to have been unnoticed (it is not found, for example, in Lightfoot's com mentary), I have since discovered to have been anticipated by St</page><page sequence="15">174 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES Epiphanius (c. Haer. II lxxiii 7). His words are, י In place of αρχήν the Apostle used πρώτος, in place of ytvva pt (i. e. the LXX rendering of of of חוקקתי 'I was brought forth' in v. 25) the term tokos, for the whole statement "EktutcV pt αρχήν όδων αντον and Γ(wa pt the expression Πρωτότοκος πάσης κτίσαως, instead of ϊθΐριΧίωσίν pt (v. 23) the State ment Έν ούτω Ικτίσθη τα πάντα, instead of Δό ipov1 the statement *Απ־' αιώνος, tvrt θρόνοι, tiTt κυριότητας, tirt άρχαί, ΐίτα ίξονσίαι, τα πάντα S1' αντοναντοΐι και ΐ'ις αντον ΐκτισται.' Here Epiphanius, having elsewhere, as we have noticed, rejected the meaning' begat me' for כןנני, does not recognize that this verb corre sponds to the second portion of the term πρωτότοκος, but finds a corre spondence less naturally in ytwo pt three verses later. The verses which follow in Col. i 16-18 as a development of πρωτότοκος πάσης κτίσιωςκτίσιωςκτίσιως are not simply, as St Epiphanius supposes, reminiscent of Prov. viii 22 and its context, but are based upon another O.T. passage, immediately suggested to the Apostle by the allusion in Proverbs. Without a doubt he is passing from the use of ראשית «beginning' in Prov. viii 22 as applicable to Christ, to the use of the same term in the creation-narrative of Genesis, where it occurs as the first word of the Hebrew Bible, בראשית Bereshith ' In the beginning '. That this is so I hope to prove presently through examination of St Paul's words. As a preliminary, however, we may notice that the tracing of a connexion between the Proverbs-passage and the Genesis-passage would be obvious to a Rabbinic scholar, and has in fact been made elsewhere in Rabbinic literature. In Bereshith Rabba, the great Midrashic commentary on Genesis, Rabbi Hoshaiah (c. third century a. d.) opens with a discussion of Prov. viii 30, where Wisdom states, ' Then I was with Him as 'amon ' (' master-workman'). After mentioning various proposed explanations of 'amSn, he continues as follows. ' Another explanation of 'amon is 'omen'omen " workman ". The Law says, " I was the working instrument of the Holy One, blessed be He ". In worldly affairs a human king who is building a palace does not build it by his own skill, but he has parchment plans (όιφθάραί) and drawing tablets {πίνακας), that he may know how to make the rooms and doors. In the same way the Holy One, blessed be He, was looking at the Law when He created the world. Now the Law says, ' By reshith God created '; and there is no reshithreshith except the Law; compare the passage, 'The Lord gat me as reshith reshith of His way'. This connexion between the two Ο. T. passages, which R.

Here we have an elaborate exposition of Bereshith in Gen. i r in the Rabbinic manner. Three explanations are given of the preposition be be be; then four explanations of the substantive rishith·. and the con elusion is that, in every possible sense of the expression, Christ is its Fulfiller. Let me give a running paraphrase of St Paul's words, in order to illustrate how, as I conceive, the argument developed itself in his • mind. ' Christ is the First-begotten of all creation, for it is written (Prov. viii 22 ff), "The Lord begat me as reshith of His way, the antecedent of His works, from of old. From eternity was I wrought . . . when there were no deeps was I brought forth ". This passage has obvious connexion with Gen. i r, where it is written " Bereshith God created the heavens and the earth". Now the force of the preposition be attached to reshith may be interpreted as " in " (" In reshith God created"); hence in Him were created all things in the heavens and upon upon the earth, seen and unseen, whether thrones, or dominations, or principalities,principalities, or powers. But again, the preposition may bear the sense " by " (" By the agency of reshith"); hence all things were created created through Him. Yet again it may be interpreted "into" (" Into reshith ") : from which it follows that creation tends into Him as its goal. Passing on to the substantive reshith, we note that it ordinarily bears the sense " Beginning "; hence Christ is before ah things.things. It may also have the meaning "Sum-total"; so that all things things are summed up in Him. Yet another meaning is " Head i. e. He is the Head of the body, namely, the Church. Lastly, it means "" First-fruits " ; He is First-fruits, first-begotten of the dead. Hence it follows that in all senses He is the Fulfiller of the meaning of reshith (πρωτεύων)(πρωτεύων) Putting the argument in tabular form for the sake of lucidity, it appears as follows. Prov. viii 2 2 ff, where Wisdom (i.e. Christ) is called reshith, gives the key to Gen. i 1, ' Bereshith God created the heavens and the earth'.</page><page sequence="17">176 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES BereshithBereshith — ' in reshith '—ίν αντίο ΐκτισθη τα ττάντα, κτλ.

Reshith Reshith = ' First-fruits י—os ΐστιν άρχη, πρωτότοκος ίκ των νικρων. Conclusion. Christ fulfils every meaning which may be extracted from Reshith—ινα γινηται iv πάσιν αυτός πρωτινών If this interpretation is correct, we can trace phrase by phrase the lines along which St Paul's thoughts were running. It is true that, if we look up reshith in a Hebrew Lexicon, while we shall find the meanings Beginning Beginning and First-fruits, we shall not find the meanings Head and Sum-total Sum-total; but since the substantive reshith is derived from rosh, which means Head, and which is also used with considerable frequency in the sense Sum-total\x these two additional meanings would easily be referable to it. The Aramaic resh stands for both Hebrew rosh and reshith,reshith, and is susceptible of all the meanings postulated. We have reference to the line of thought here based on the two Old Testament passages elsewhere in St Paul's Epistles. Christ as the goal of creation is referred to in Ephes. i ΙΟ άνακιφαλαιώσασθαι τα πάντα iv τώ Χριστώ,Χριστώ,' to bring all things under reshith in Christ', who is the Head and Sum-total Sum-total of creation. The reversion of humanity to its Source, which is the aim of Christianity, is the καινή κτίσις to which the Apostle refers in 2 Cor. ν 17, Gal. vi 15 ; cf. also Ephes. ii 10, αντοΰ γάρ ισμιν ποίημα, κτισθίν■κτισθίν■κτισθίν■τις ίν Χριστώ 'Ιησοΰ. When this has been accomplished in the world, creation will have reached its goal.2 We may notice that several of the Fathers adopt the interpre tation of bereshith in Gen. i 1 as referring to Christ. We find it in Origen, Homily I on the Pentateuch, the opening of which runs thus in the translation of Rufinus: '"In principio creavit Deus coelum et terram." Quod est omnium principium nisi Dominus noster et Saluator omnium Christus Jesus, " primogenitus omnis creaturae"? In hoc ergo principio, hoc est in Verbo suo, "Deus coelum et terram fecit", sicut et Evangelista Ioannes in initio Euangelii sui ait, dicens: " In principio erat verbum " &amp;c. Non ergo hie temporale aliquod prin cipium dicit, sed " in principio ", id est in Salvatore, factum esse dicit coelum et terram et omnia quae facta sunt'. St Ambrose (Hexae » Cf. Exod. XXX ι a פי תשא את־רא׳ם בני ישראל 'When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel' (i.e. their census) ; Lev. ν 24 ; Num. i 2, 49, iv 2, 2 2, ν 7, xxvi 2, xxxi 26, 49; Ps. cxix 160, cxxxix 17. a The thought underlying os \στιν αρχή, πρωτότοκος €κ των νεκρών is brought out again in 1 Cor. xv 20 απαρχή των κίκοιμημίνων (cf. also ν, 23).</page><page sequence="18">NOTES AND STUDIES 177 merortmerort I iv 15) and St Augustine (De Genesi ad litteram I 2) also give the same interpretation. Another New Testament allusion to Prov. viii 22 in reference to Christ is found in Rev. iii 14 ή άρχή της κτίσΐως τον ©eov, a title of the risen Christ which Dr Swete and Dr Charles have not a shadow of anthority for limiting in meaning to ' the Source of God's creation There is every reason to suppose that άρχή is here used with all the fullness of meaning which St Paul extracts from reshith—Beginning, Sum-total, Head, First-fruits. This at any rate fits in with the state ment of xxi 6, iyS το Α και το Ω, ή άρχή και το τέλος, where το τέλος embodies the interpretation of bereshith ' into Him' as the goal. C. F. Burney. C. F.
