Like many old saws, gap-filling contains a degree of ancient wis dom; nevertheless, the concepts behind the cliche call for some examination. The particular question arises because of the Museum's acquisition of the Gainsborough por trait of Lord Rivers, one of the largest and most commanding works in this Year in Review for 1971. Our collection of British painting is certainly small, but it consists largely of major pictures by major masters. The Ladies Amabel and Mary Jemima Yorke by Reynolds, Lady Dysart as Juno by Lawrence, and The Burning of the Houses of Parliament by Turner would be stars in any as semblage of British painting. Gainsborough and Constable-are particularly glaring lacunae in this listing. George Pitt, First Lord Rivers cer tainly "fills a gap" as well as any British regiment "closed a line" in the eighteenth century. But the real questions are: why fill it? and does the new addition hold the line? To the first question there is an obviously seduc tive answer which requires qualification, at least; even outright resistance. As one becomes more and more scientific and art-historical, one comes to think of a collection as an illustration of history. The desire for encyclopedic completeness-per haps led by the Germanic museum tradition-is understandable, but only so if ideal conditions prevail. These conditions would be the total avail ability of fine original works of art for selection into a rational historical sequence. Such condi tions have never prevailed with originals; but, they do now exist with reproductions. This was one of the major points of Andre Malraux' Museum Without Walls-that photography made the complete "museum" possible, both in a se quential sense and in the visually more stimulating method ofjuxtapositions of historically disparate, but otherwise related, pictures of works of art. So pervasive and persuasive has this vision been that many professionals have transferred the method back to original works. Too often the real work of art is considered as an illustration to art history. Hence the need to fill gaps; hence the need for encyclopedic collections; hence the misunder standing of the primary function of art. Here the layman is far closer to the truth than many art historians. Paintings were not created to illustrate history, social development, economic patterns, patronage, or taste-to enumerate only a few of the interesting byways of the study of art. They were painted to reveal something that could not be shown in any other way: visual meaning, in cluding what one used to call design, representa tion, and often symbolic meaning. The impact of any work of art lies in its originality-in all of the nuances not conveyed by a reproduction. In short, historical gaps are usually best filled by an illus tration of a classic work rather than by a poor original. This is not to say that gaps should not be filled when it becomes possible to do so with a work that measures up in large part to a reproducible classic work. The warning presented here is that the temptation to complete a sequence often leads to unjustified optimism about the candidates for in sertion in the sequence. Search one must. Prayer 3</page><page sequence="3">may be helpful. But a strong dose of skepticism about such possible acquisitions is the only spe cific for success. For more than twenty years we have had Gainsborough on our minds. Lord Rivers, we believe, takes its proper place with our other British paintings in revealing Gainsborough as the great master he is, with his own particular style and quality. It fills the gap not only as a quintes sential representation of his best achievements in figure and in landscape, but as a sensitive, sym pathetic, and striking image in the Western world of individual portraiture. (See William Talbot's article in the November 1971 Bulletin.) In other areas, we have added to existing strengths or growing strengths. The South Indian bronze Shiva, the Kushan stone Yakshis, the Chinese paintings, and the German International Gothic Pietd (Vesperbild) are examples of the former. The long lost Gentileschi Danae, the Lys Triumphant Love, and the LaHyre Kiss of Peace and Plenty are all notable additions to an increas ingly solid showing of European painting of the seventeenth century. One could continue to enu merate, but the following catalogue and illustra tions do this logically and succinctly. That so much was accomplished in 1971 at this late date in the declining history of collecting is due to con tinuous creative and scholarly activity by the cura torial staff and the unstinted encouragement of the Trustees, and particularly of the Accessions Committee. Gaps and strengths remain, while Fortune largely calls the turn. SHERMAN E.
