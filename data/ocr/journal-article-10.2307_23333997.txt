<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tim Lewens, Organisms and Artifacts: Design in Nature and Elsewhere, Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, 2004, xi + 183 pp., £20.95. There are interesting analogies between organisms and artifacts. Lewens uses these analogies, as well as the disanalogies, to cast some light on adaptation, function, and related topics. Or perhaps we should say terms, because it is traditional for philosophy to take the form of talk about talk. Fortunately he manages to get beyond mere lan guage analysis and consider what the discourse is ail about. Not so fortunately he per sists in the usual vice among philosophers of using the word 'teleology' without giving much thought to its meaning. Therefore terms like 'function', 'purpose' and 'design' are ail teleological. Lewens maintains that biologists use these words to talk about organisms in the same ways that laypersons talk about artifacts. But do we think about organisms in that way? Not if we are competent scientists, and Lewens's analysis is basically consistent with that. When we use such words as 'purpose' and 'design' we are attributing intentionali ty to something. Such intention of course exists in human behavior, including the mak ing of artifacts. Teleological thinking is something more than that however. It makes a tacit metaphysical leap and assumes that such intentionality can be presupposed in the interprétation of natural phenomena. 'Teleology' like 'anthropomorphism' is the name of an inappropriate way to conduct one's intellectual life. It would be best if the word were not used for anything else. Lewens recognizes that biologists avoid using teleological language and may treat it as metaphorical and therefore not to be taken literally. They often use scare quotes, especialîy around 'purpose' and 'design'. He also points out that teleological words are rarely used in the technical literature. Curiously, however, he says the same of 'func tion' while admitting that it seems to be respectable in certain kinds of biology. Having written a doctoral dissertation published as Reproductive Function and the Phylogeny of Opisthobranch Gastropods, I was a bit taken aback by this claim. Lewens seems not to have noticed that the term 'function' is equivocal. On the one hand it means, as in the title of the journal Functional Biology, how, say, an organ system works: how it functions. On the other hand it also means the spécial rôles of the component organ</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS - Hist. Phil.

The oviduct functions by ciliary action: its functions include secreting coverings around the egg. I strongly agree that the concept of function is not historical. Those philosophers who attempted to redefine 'function' so as to make it the product of selection failed altogether. We of course do not say that the function of the thyroid is to form a sheet of mucus that collects plankton from the seawater, though that is what it once did. Moving things into the less distant past does not work either. Even saying, as Lewens does, that the function of a trait is the contribution that it makes to fitness does not really salvage the selective causality account. It simply invokes a truism when one grants that natural selection accounts for the organisms being adapted. Adaptation, not function, is the historical concept; that means an historical narrative in which, among other things, homologous parts undergo changes in function. They have dif férent functions at différent stages in their evolutionary history, just as they may dur ing ontogeny. Lewens suggests that not ail concepts of homology are historical, but clearly the historical concept is the only one that is applicable in the context of an adaptive scénario. The point is, rather, that although natural selection can be used to account for the existence of functions it is not defining of 'function' itself. I think the work would have been much improved had more attention been given to the metaphysics of agency. The discussion on whether selection is a force and upon what it acts, makes no sense once we realize that selection is not an agent and, there fore, does not act at ail. (I usually give the example of undressing, which can affect someone by causing him to be nude, but does not act at ail.) We are told that while natural selection applies to populations, intentional selection applies to individual objects. No, that is not what happens. Organisms and artifacts are selected, but pop ulations composed of organisms and populations composed of artifacts evolve. In arti ficial selection, the selective agent, which is the breeder, may act upon individual organisms and thereby affect the population, which is the breed. There are further problems with agency in Lewens's discussion of selfish genes and related topics. He objects to calling recordings replicators on the grounds that they are not self-replicat ing in the sense of being wholly causally responsible for their faithful replication. But that is true of genes as well, including selfish chromosomal deletions. Genes do not replicate themselves. They get replicated. Too many philosophers have been duped by this kind of sophistry. In English and many other languages, the suffix -or always means the active agent, not the thing acted upon: a piece of paper is not a copier. Likewise calling the soma a 'vehicle' dupes the uncritical into conceiving of the entity therein contained as an Aristotelian 'that for the sake of which a thing exists'. That kind of talk is teleological. And one wonders to what extent it is theological. Some of the people whose views Lewens discusses are advocates of intelligent design. Others talk as if they believed that natural selection can or should take the place of God in a kind of secular religion. And no doubt many of them do view it that way, per haps without being conscious of it. The topic would be better understood if we could focus on the underlying motivations for ail this talk. mlchael T.
