ADORNMENT AND IDENTITY Shell ornaments from Formative K'axob Ilean Isel Isaza Aizpurúa and Patricia A. McAnany Department of Archaeology, Boston University, 675 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA 02215, USA Abstract Excavations in Formative and Early Classic contexts at the Maya site of K'axob have produced a sample of 2,568 worked-shell ornaments crafted from both marine and freshwater species. Predominantly shell beads, the sample also includes unique pendants, figurines, and tinklers. A high frequency of unfinished beads in Middle Formative and early Late Formative midden contexts provides strong evidence of localized shell working and trading connections with the Caribbean. Personal adornment crafted from shell is an important item in many burials, including those of children. The most lavish disposal of shell, however, occurs in one of the earliest Middle Formative interments at K'axob. An adult male—who may have been a "founder" of K'axob—was buried with 2,019 shell beads. Through time, fewer individuals were buried with worked shell as the intricacy of shell working became more elaborate and possibly iconic of roles of authority. Interpretation of archaeological patterns indicates that shell beads can provide significant insight into the construction of social identities. Within the domain of archaeology, personal ornamentation often is studied from the perspective of status grades, with greater amounts of ornamentation presumed to be indicative of higher sta tus. While this logical coupling enjoys a certain degree of empir ical grounding, other factors may play a role in the fabrication, display, and eventual deposition or burial of items of personal or namentation. For instance, indigenous conceptions of beauty and cosmological significance may condition the selection of raw ma terials, the form, and the ubiquity of ornamentation. If an item of adornment is retrieved from a burial context, as most are, then the crafted ornament most likely speaks also to the affections of sur vivors toward the deceased, particularly when the item adorns a child who may hold only the promise of great status (cf. Hayden 1995). Belief in an afterlife, moreover, often engenders the desire to properly adorn a deceased individual for the liminal journey into the afterlife. In short, the symbolic and social entanglements (following Thomas [1991] and Appadurai [1986]) of items of adorn ment may carry more weight than simple status signification. Shell, both marine and freshwater, is one of the most common raw materials used for the crafting of personal ornamentation. Re trieved from the cosmologically charged watery depths, shell is relatively easy to drill, cut, incise, and shape. Globally and through time, shell has been highly sought after and often is cited as an item of value in exchange networks and prestation spheres (e.g., Carey 1986,1991; Gould 1966; Hughes 1977; Meggit 1972; Weiner 1987). Technological studies of shell-bead production, for exam ple, have highlighted the importance of shell beads in prehistoric California (Arnold and Munns 1994) and Mississippian societies (Yerkes 1991). Shell ornaments are particularly ubiquitous in Me solithic and Neolithic contexts in the Mediterranean (Miller 1996, 1997) and the Levant (Bar Yosef 1989), as well as in Formative period Mesoamerica, the area under consideration here. The present study addresses the distribution of beads and other types of worked shell from the lowland Maya site of K'axob, in Belize. Contextual evidence suggests the perpetuation of con structed identities through the inclusion of worked shell in mor tuary contexts of both children and adults. Such identities appear to project Maya conceptions of status, beauty, and parental invest ment in children. This study is based on the analysis of 2,568 shell ornaments, which are predominantly from Formative-period resi dential and mortuary contexts. The sample was collected from seven stratified excavation locales for which a relative chronology based on ceramic complexes (anchored by radiocarbon accelerator as says) has been constructed (see McAnany and López Varela [ 1999] for details of excavations and ceramic complexes). The majority of worked shell and shell debris was found at Operation I, a 6-X 8-m trench containing closely stratified Middle and Late Forma tive deposits (see Figure 2 in McAnany and López Varela 1999). Although shell ornaments (often unfinished or broken) were re covered from midden and construction-fill contexts, the bulk of worked shell was found in mortuary deposits. Specifically, 29 burial contexts contained shell beads, whereas 14 mortuary facilities yielded other types of worked shell, such as pendants and "tin klers" (see Table 2, McAnany et al. 1999; see also for general in formation on mortuary patterns at K'axob). Before contextual and temporal patterns of K'axob shell adornments are discussed, how ever, historical trends in the study of shell working and shell or namentation are reviewed for the Maya region. HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE STUDY OF SHELL WORKING Prior to the research of E. Wyllys Andrews IV (1969), which dealt with the natural distribution of Caribbean and Gulf Coast mol 117</page><page sequence="2">118 Isaza Aizpurúa and McAnany lusks, the study of shell artifacts was restricted to individual site reports. References to the craft of shell working within these pub lications were limited, providing only classified lists of artifacts based on presumed function and raw material. Andrews's publica tion marked the beginning of comparative shell-artifact analysis for the lowland Maya region. In addition to providing a compre hensive list of 192 mollusk species used for artifact manufacture (with photographic illustrations), he offered information concern ing the modern distribution of species, as well as archaeological occurrences within 19 Maya sites. His analysis concluded with a thorough discussion of ancient lowland ecology, possible Maya trade systems, and the social significance of shell ornaments. Apart from Andrews's research, other publications that have provided an exhaustive treatment of worked-shell artifacts include Meredith Dreiss (1982, 1994), Lawrence Feldman (1968, 1969, 1972, 1974, 1976), Lourdes Suárez-Díaz (1989), and Robert Novella (1995), the last of which deals with materials from western Mexico. Following Andrews's 1969 publication, researchers involved with shell analyses obtained a greater awareness of the potential of this data class for the study of cultural behavior. Within the Maya area, subsequent site-specific studies include Hattula Moholy-Nagy (1963,1978, 1985,1989,1994) on Tikal; Rafael Cobos (1991,1994) on Chichen Itza and Caracol (respectively); Palma Buttles (1992); Meredith L. Dreiss (1982, 1994) and Daniel R. Potter (1982) on Colha; James Garber (1989) on Cerros; and Jennifer T. Taschek (1994) on Dzibilchaltun. Based on the analysis of worked shell from Tikal, Moholy Nagy detected gradual changes in artifact manufacture, species se lection, and the ritual uses of shell. Evidence of shell imports from the Caribbean coast appeared at Tikal as early as the Middle For mative period. Artifact manufacture was based on the use of fresh water species and marine conch shell, specifically Pleuroploca gigantea, or Strombus spp. By the Late Formative period, new ma rine species were introduced, such as Spondylus spp., the cultural distribution of which was restricted to elite contexts. Moholy Nagy (1989:152-155) makes special note of the correlation be tween Spondylus sp. shell and jadeite, both of which were encountered together—not only in burials, but also in cache offer ings. According to Moholy-Nagy's analysis, shell working changed very little throughout the Formative period; that is, the form of shell beads and the types of raw material remained constant. Dur ing the Classic period, new forms were introduced, and a nacreous freshwater species was exploited. Moholy-Nagy (1994:93-106) concludes that shell ornaments at Tikal functioned as social insig nia and were related to ritual offerings within different levels of the social strata; furthermore, the species, as well as the intricacy of the worked shell, were prime characteristics associated with elite contexts. Recently, scholars have focused on the identification of produc tion areas where shell working probably occurred (Cobos 1994; Jones 1996). At the Classic lowland Maya site of Caracol, for ex ample, analysis of lithic deposits and shell debris provided evi dence of locales at which shell artifacts were crafted (Jones 1991, 1994, 1996). The study of the Caracol "workshop" debris demon strates that the direct association of lithic tools with unfinished marine and freshwater shell artifacts and raw material can provide useful information on locales and methods of production that, in turn, support the recognition of the types of tools used for shell ornament manufacture (Jones 1996:146-149). At Formative K'axob, the lack of prodigious quantities of such production de bris (tools as well as cut and broken shell fragments) from Forma tive levels indicates that the crafting of shell was focused on local needs and, perhaps, gift giving. This scale of production contrasts with other kinds of production locales, such as Colha, where there exist massive Middle and Late Formative lithic-debris piles formed by the fabrication of flaked-stone tools that were traded widely throughout northern Belize (Shafer and Hester 1991). Developments in the study of Mesoamerican cosmology and iconography have engendered a linkage between shell representa tions or artifacts and such life-giving forces as rain and fertility (Andrews IV 1969; Fearer Safer and McLaughlin Gill 1982; No vella 1995). Species such as Spondylus sp. and Strombus sp., for example, are represented in the Madrid Codex and the Dresden Codex, and have been associated with deified personages—among them God N and Mam, the earth god (Fearer Safer and McLaugh lin Gill 1982). The symbolic significance of shell is further bol stered by its representation on Classic Maya monumental sculpture, where fertility is imaged as an aspect of political power. At K'axob, the symbolism of shell is particularly apparent in both the inclu sion of unmodified freshwater gastropods, Pomacea spp., in Late Formative mortuary contexts and in the Terminal Formative ap pearance of such marine-shell genera as Oliva and Spondylus, which are restricted to specific mortuary and structure-dedication rituals. One of the major problems concerning the analysis of shell work ing has been the heretofore limited discussion of the symbolic, as well as identity-forging, significance of shell in archaeological con texts. The mention of shell in the majority of monographs and in terim reports on Maya sites hardly surpasses a listing of species and a proposed typology of shell ornaments. This situation has worsened with the fact that most of the symbolic interpretations of ritual offerings emphasize the importance of ceramics, obsidian, chert, and—of course—jadeite artifacts. It is not our intention to propose that shells were primary signifiers of status, identity, or ritual practice, but we do seek to understand changes (through the Formative period) in the role played by this material in the active construction of social identity. DEFINING WORKED-SHELL TYPES AT K'AXOB The classification of K'axob worked shell includes 6 type and 18 subtype categories that define artifacts groups (Table 1). "Type" defines the worked shell by general shape and possible function (e.g., bead or pendant), whereas "subtype" classifies the artifacts according to their specific cultural modifications and, sometimes, their size. In this respect, an artifact classified as a bead is a small (less than 25 mm in diameter) pellet pierced for stringing. The subtype category ranges from beads that are irregular (generally unfinished) to regular-shaped and sometimes carved examples. The subtype category, therefore, sometimes captures information about production stage. The bead subtype "other" refers to more elabo rate geometrically carved beads. Because each artifact type presents diverse kinds of cultural modification, the subtype categories are unique within each type. Given the small size of the shell beads, most of which are less than 5 mm in diameter (Isaza Aizpurúa 1997), species—and even genus—identifications are often ten tative and, for this reason, are reported here simply as relative percentages of the dominant genera. Because of the structural com plexity of shell, it is almost impossible to determine the species of worked ornaments, unless the artifact is cut and a microscopic analy sis is performed. The temporal distribution and sample size of each type of worked shell is presented in Table 2; the defining charac teristics of each type of worked shell are as follows.</page><page sequence="3">Shell ornaments from K'axob 119 Table 1.

Beads are commonly used as necklaces, bracelets, or earrings. Most beads (81%) were crafted from marine shell, Strombus spp., but a significant portion (18%) were made of freshwater Unionidae spp. shell, which was probably acquired lo cally from the New River. Based on the unfinished margins of some of the irregular beads, these were made from the whorl of marine shells.. Disk A "disk" is a circular ornament without drilled holes. Regular disks are plain, whereas carved disks feature incised decorations (Fig ure 2f-i). Commonly fabricated from the whorl of the thicker, more durable marine shell, Strombus is a preferred genus for disks. Pendant A "pendant" is a relatively large (more than than 20 mm long) ornament pierced for suspension. Unlike a bead, the drilled hole of a pendant is located near the artifact's edges. There can be more than two orifices. Unmodified gastropod and bivalve pendant sub types (see Table 2) include pierced shells with no evidence of edge grinding (Figure li-1). "Carved" pendants are those with carved or shaped edges or with incised decoration (Figures lm-p and 2a-b). Although low in frequency (n = 21), pendants tend to be distinctive adornments that were made from either marine or fresh water shells, especially Strombus spp. Figurine or Blank A "figurine or blank" is a nondrilled shell ornament or figurine (Figure 2c-e). A blank could represent a shell artifact in the pro cess of manufacture, as represented by the presence of local Uni onidae spp., but this category also includes the Spondylus sp. and Strombus spp. figurines (see Figure 2c-d) from the "triadic" cache in Operation I (see McAnany and Lopez Varela 1999). Tinkler A "tinkler" is a bell-shaped adornment, commonly made from Oliva or Olivella shell species, sometimes pierced more than once through any part of its surface, and often cut at the base to create a flat bottom (Figures 2j-m and 3). On stela carvings, for example, the high-relief stelae from Copan (Baudez 1994:Figures 7-9, 11-13, 16-18, 26, 29-30, 39, 49-55, 61-62), and Tikal (Jones and Sat terthwaite 1982:Figures 7, 12, 14, 16, 26-27, 29, 31, and 33), medium-sized tinklers are shown as sewn on the hems of gar ments of elite personages—indicating that they were part of ritual dress. Based on the "tinkling" sound produced by their contact, these shell ornaments probably played an important role in pro ducing an effective acoustical environment for ritual dance. Other The "other" category includes worked marine shell of miscellane ous shapes, many of which are made from the remnant columella (Figure 4). TEMPORAL AND CONTEXTUAL TRENDS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF WORKED SHELL Since the Formative-period deposits of K'axob are well stratified, it is possible to discuss changes in the presence, frequency, and Table 2.

Here, the temporal and spatial patterns are presented as a basis for the following discussion of their meaning and significance in terms of identity construction. Early Chaakkax deposits (see Table 2) contain a high frequency of marine-shell beads and, to a lesser extent, disks and pendants. Beads (both finished and unfinished or irregular) were commonly encountered within primary burials, as well as in domestic deposits (especially midden) and, to a lesser extent, construction fill, pits, sherd-lined pits, and the earliest level of a "kitchen" floor (Table 3; see McAnany and López Varela [1999] for details of early Chaakkax structures). More than 80% of the shell beads from this early context were made from Caribbean ma rine shell, specifically Strombus spp., indicating reliable trade con nections with the coast. Keen knowledge of local resources is also indicated by the fact that more than 15% of the shell beads were fabricated from the locally available riverine nacreous shell, Uni onidae spp. The most spectacular deposit of early Chaakkax shell orna ments, however, occurs with Burial 43 (Operation I), the inter ment of an adult male that contained 2,019 marine-shell beads. Beads were clustered around different parts of the anatomy of this extended individual, allowing a distribution analysis (Table 4). Semiregular beads with thin walls and a semitubular shape were associated with the upper part of the humeri, whereas regular and semiregular beads with thicker walls and a discoidal shape were clustered in the carpus, head, torso, and pelvic area. The shell beads along the humeri and carpal areas were arranged in a series of five to six layers, the remnants of armbands and bracelets. Beads as sociated with the head, torso, and pelvis, on the other hand, were more widely dispersed and had probably been attached to a head band, necklace, and belt. Irregularly shaped beads were found on the exterior of the carpi and humeri, and two shell disks were scat tered in the burial fill. Throughout the Formative period, no other burial approaches Burial 43 in abundance of bead ornamentation. This fact, along with the fine quality of the two associated ceramic vessels (one of which is illustrated in Figure 2, McAnany et al. 1999), suggests that Burial 43 was an individual of high status, perhaps one of the founding ancestors of the Formative village of K'axob. Burial 43 is one of the earliest interments identified be low Structure 1, a residence occupied through most of the Forma tive period. Other evidence of distinct social identities comes from child and adult burials. Child Burial 35 (also from Operation I), for ex ample, revealed the earliest evidence of the use of 11 miniature 0/i'va-shell tinklers less than 8 mm in length (see Table 2). Three adult burials (Burials 19, 35, and the above-mentioned 43) yielded evidence of semiregular, regular, and carved shaped beads in the cranial area, indicating distinctive head adornments. Of particular relevance to the recreation of Chaakkax-complex mortuary ritual is the discovery of irregularly shaped beads scattered throughout the burial fill of primary, extended adult interments (Burials 28, 30-A, and 43, all from Operation I). Later, when irregularly shaped Figure I.

The edges of these beads are not smoothly ground, suggesting that they were not finished beads. They are found in burial fill either because they were scattered as part of a mortuary ritual, or were deposited as a result of the fact that burial pits were refilled using midden depos Figure 3. Tinkler carved into skull effigy and found in association with child Burial 14, Operation I [photograph by Matthew Bobo). its that contained debris from bead production, such as unfinished beads. The authors favor the former interpretation, but the latter cannot, at this time, be disproven. Although none of the burials with evidence of unfinished, scattered beads contained lithic arti facts that might indicate the interment of shell craftspersons, the presence of rich midden deposits with marine and freshwater shell artifacts at different stages of manufacture, shell debris, and lithic artifacts in both early and late Chaakkax middens could indicate that shell working was a frequent craft activity at K'axob during the Middle Formative period (see Table 3). Early K'atabche'kax times mark a continuation of the Chaakkax pattern of shell working, specifically the continued presence of a midden rich in unfinished shell beads and of individuals buried with shell-bead adornment (see Tables 2 and 3). The pattern of shell-bead production, primarily from marine shell (Strombus spp.) and secondarily from freshwater Unionidae spp., remains con stant but for the addition of a few new species. Subtle changes had, however, occurred. Burial and pit features from this time in clude more regularly shaped and discoidal carved beads. Unmod ified gastropod and bivalve pendants become common within burial interments (e.g., Burials 3 and 7, Operation XI, and Burial 27 at Operation I). The practice of interring distinctive and well-crafted shell artifacts with subadults, on the other hand, continued through the early K'atabche'kax complex. Five carved, discoidal shell beads were placed above the skull, possibly as part of a head adornment, of secondarily interred adolescent Burial 18.

Worked shell fragments: [a] Strombus spp.; (b-c) distal ends of columella, probably Strombus spp.; (d) gastropod (illustrations by I. Isaza A.). that of a child, contained a bivalve pendant placed over the child's pelvis, possibly serving as a pubic shield. Shell from late-facet K'atabche'kax-complex deposits reveals coeval developments among shell crafting and architectural and ritual elaboration. At this time, a raised rectangular platform was constructed at the Operation I locale, and the construction of sim ple, low structures began at many of the satellite areas. This con struction initiated the beginning of architectural differentiation that increased through the remaining time of the Formative period and resulted ultimately in Classic-period pyramid construction at K'axob. Contemporaneously, bead production from the genera Strombus and Unionidae and bead deposition within burial con texts decreased (see Tables 2 and 3). Shell ornaments crafted from a new genus of marine shell—Oliva—began to assume impor tance within a limited number of K'axob burials (Figure 21). Com monly called tinklers, complete specimens of this shell adornment were found only in such ritual deposits as burials and caches; only fragmented specimens were recovered from construction fill and floors. Unlike shell beads, there is little evidence of tinklers in midden and construction-fill deposits. Zoomorphic pendants also became popular during this time, as exemplified by the frog pen dant (see Figure 2a) from Burial 41—which bears a similarity to the more tightly flexed carved-shell toad effigy from Cuello (Ham mond 1991:Figure 8.42). The K'axob frog pendant was framed by Table 3.

Continuing a tradition from earlier times, the commu nity buried children with unique worked-shell adornments. From Operation XI, child Burial 7—clearly associated with a new con struction event—was interred with a bivalve pendant, while at Op eration I, a unique tinkler carved to represent a death's head (see Figure 3) was placed at the knees of a flexed child (Burial 14). More frequently found in Postclassic contexts (Coggins and Shane 1984), here the death's head is clearly from a Late Formative context. Burial depressions from Late K'atabche'kax interments— increasingly used for multiple individuals—contained only a light scattering of unfinished beads, particularly in Operations I and VIII. At Operations XI and XII, however, the fill surrounding seated or flexed single burials contained some scattered irregular beads. Dur ing both early and late facets of the K'atabche'kax complex, of ferings of unworked freshwater gastropods (Pomacea flagellata) played an important role in ritual deposits, both caches and buri als. For instance, in Burials 23, 32 and 39 (Operation I) and Burial 8 (Operation XI), whole Pomacea spp. shells were found as "carpet" deposits at the base of the burial. Such deposits sug gest that burial might have been conceived as placing the de ceased in a watery environment. During the terminal K'atabche'kax complex, shell working, and certainly bead production, is no longer evident at Operation I, partly because of the increasingly formalized, ritualized use of space at this locale. Two of the excavated southern structures (Operations VII and X), however, revealed scattered fragments of shell working debris (Figure 4a-b), suggesting new locations for the production of shell artifacts, albeit lacking the density of unfin ished worked shell found in the earlier Chaakkax and K'atabche'kax deposits of Operation I. Clearly evident, moreover, is the dramatic decrease in the presence of beads in any context (see Table 2); this trend is correlated with the greatly reduced presence of worked shell crafted from Strombus spp. and a total lack of shell worked from freshwater Unionidae spp. On the other hand, species diver sity peaks during the terminal K'atabche'kax complex, with 10 shell species represented, many with singular occurrences except for Oliva spp., the shell from which tinklers were crafted. Tinklers increased significantly during this time, particularly in the multi ple secondary burials found within the plaza area of Operation I (Burials 1 and 2) and a primary flexed adult (Burial 2) from Op eration XII, the latter of whom was buried with a single 40-mm long tinkler. Significantly, these mortuary contexts were also the loci of intensive ritual practice. Broken fragments of tinklers were recovered from the terminal K'atabche'kax floor of Structure 1 (Operation I), a plaza floor at Operation X, and later, from the external wall of a Nohalkax domestic structure at Operation VII. As well as a time of increased species diversity, terminal K'atabche'kax shell carving shows significant elaboration. For in stance, at Operation VII, the skillfully carved but broken quadru ped pendant (see Figure 2b) was recovered from a floor context. At Operation I, a dedicatory cache that effectively sealed earlier multiple-burial deposits contained a complex triadic-coded assem blage of anthropomorphic and comma-shaped figures, disks, and perforated shell made from Spondylus, Strombus, and Unionidae shells, as well as jadeite (see Figures lo, 2c and e; see also Fig ure 11 in McAnany and López Varela 1999); this cache marks the first appearance of Spondylus at K'axob. The presence of a sizable jadeite bead in tandem with a large carved marine-shell bead (see Figure lg) from Burial 3, Operation VIII, suggests a trend toward the manufacture of larger, finely carved items of worked shell. From the sparsely represented early Nohalkax complex (see Table 2), the presence of large, carved shell ornaments suggests a continuation with the preceding terminal-K'atabche'kax pattern of shell working at K'axob. Although small, the sample from this com plex reveals a high level of craft skill (see Figures lh and 2m) in shaping geometric beads and cutting and perforating large Oliva spp. shells. Overall and through time, deposits related to construction events (fill, floors, postholes, and walls) contained roughly half as much worked shell as did midden contexts (see Table 3). Within con struction deposits, beads are the most common shell type; they often co-occur with lithics and shell debris. Midden contexts, on the other hand, contain the highest frequency and diversity of fin ished and unfinished shell artifacts, also associated with shell de bris and lithic artifacts not yet analyzed. Chaakkax and early K'atabche'kax middens generally were located immediately adja cent to the primary, frequently renovated Structure 1 of Opera tion I (see McAnany and López Varela [1999] for plan-view images and discussion of structure renovation). This association provides direct and incontrovertible evidence of local production of marine and freshwater shell adornment, particularly during Chaakkax times and continuing through much of the K'atabche'kax complex.</page><page sequence="8">124 Isaza Aizpurúa and McAnany The presence of 25 pieces of worked shell within small pit fea tures (see Table 3) is probably a function of the manner in which depressions in an extramural work area tended to be refilled with midden materials. On the other hand, the inclusion of 22 shell ar tifacts from terminal K'atabche'kax times in a single "triadic" cache deposit represents a very purposeful and cosmologically charged use of shell. Equally significant and more abundant is shell adorn ment from burial contexts, which seems to have played a key role in creating and perpetuating the identity of individuals within the community. IDENTITY AND WORKED-SHELL ADORNMENT Hayden (1995:49) has called attention to the fact that the burial of children with personal adornment and other accouterments, while often interpreted as evidence of ascribed status, may actually be more accurately conceived of as evidence of parental investment, or what Hayden terms "child growth payments." Cited as occur ring in "transegalitarian" societies (which are ranked but not strat ified; Hayden 1995:50), child growth payments are investments of wealth in children, particularly through rituals linked to rites of passage. In this regard, Landa's references (Tozzer 1941) to the manner in which sixteenth-century Yucatec Maya parents doted on their children and the rites of passage that children underwent seem particularly applicable. Through such investments in chil dren, personal identities were forged at an early age; the pre mature death of a child more likely led to displays of wealth or identity. Through the Formative period, six subadults were buried with unique shell adornments (Table 5), and several more, while not adorned with shell, were interred with an adult in a carefully prepared burial pit (see section on multiple interments in McAnany et al. 1999). Worked shell, thus, seems to have been a marker of identity for children during the Formative period. In terms of personal adornment. Formative-period changes in worked shell—both in species exploited and type of adornment fashioned—are highly relevant to the forging of identities. During the early and late facets of both the Chaakkax and K'atabche'kax complexes, shell was fabricated primarily into beads that, judging from the distribution of shell beads around Burial 43, were worn as bracelets and necklaces, as well as sewn onto headgear. There is a certain uniformity to these beads, with gross differences at tributable to production stage as much as to stylistic variation. Per sonal identities seem to have been linked to the number of beads with which one was buried, rather than to the distinctiveness of the beads. There is a certain interchangeability and fluidity to beads; personal exchanges of strands of worked shell between trading part ners during gift-giving and other types of rituals is well docu mented for the Pacific northwest and Melanesia (e.g., Malinowsi 1961; Weiner 1987). In essence, beads are a highly convertible kind of wealth that are indicative of status only when grouped to gether in lavish quantities. Pendants and tinklers, on the other hand, are linked qualita tively to identities. Pendants were worn as a singular item that gen erally rests on the chest. During the Classic period, Maya royalty were often shown wearing jadeite pendants with the face of the sun god Kinich Ahau or the side profile of an ancestor (McAnany 1998), thus linking them with the power and centrality of the sun and with the weighty precedent of forebears. Although it is diffi cult to know the exact significance of Formative-period shell pen dants, it is clear that this type of adornment was linked to specific societal roles and was not interchangeable in the manner of shell beads. Pendants, moreover, display negative covariation with shell beads (see Table 2), becoming increasingly common during the later part of the Formative period as beads were diminishing in frequency. Pendants, however, are never as ubiquitous as shell beads. Although Classic-period carvings and paintings probably do not show the full range of uses to which tinklers were put, carved stone images do show tinklers sewn onto the hems of the ritual attire of rulers of Copan (Baudez 1994) and Tikal (Jones and Satterthwaite 1982), among others. As such, these perforated Oliva shells were not "stand-alone" items of adornment, as shell beads were, but in stead were part of specific ritual costumes. These costumes may have been worn particularly when dance accompanied ritual ac tivity, thus fully using the acoustical effect of the tinkling sound produced by shells contacting each other. At K'axob, complete tinklers—unlike shell beads—are rarely found outside of such spe cific ritual contexts as burials and caches, and were never scat tered unfinished into burial pits. These differences indicate that the crafting and wearing of tinklers was more restricted than those of shell beads. Excluding the early Chaakkax child burial with which 11 miniature tinklers were placed, tinklers were rare before terminal K'atabche'kax times (see Table 2). Like pendants, tin klers show a negative covariation with beads and assume an im portance rather suddenly and only in selected contexts. The identity of an individual wearing tinklers, moreover, was vested in the rit ual costume of which tinklers were only one of many elements of what was generally extremely complex ritual attire. Linked to rit ual performance, tinklers are indicative of the developing syner gism between ritual and political authority that so typifies the Classic period. The late K'atabche'kax complex contains the peak number of individuals who were buried with worked shell (n = 14). This com plex also contains the highest number of burials (n = 40; see Table 5), which means that only 35% of interred individuals were buried with worked shell either adorning their body, placed next to their body, or scattered through the fill of the burial pit. This percentage is congruent with an overall temporal trend of decreas ing proportions of burials adorned with shell ornaments. Mortu ary rituals conducted during the early years of the settlement of the Formative village of K'axob—early Chaakkax complex—■ resulted in the placement of shell in 86% of burial interments. From late Chaakkax times through early Nolhalkax, the percentage of community members with shell adornment diminished from 67 to 8% (see Table 5). Not only were fewer individuals interred with shell, but the type of shell changed from all-purpose, exchange able shell beads to large, distinctive pieces of worked shell that appear to be iconic of political and ritual roles. By terminal K'atabche'kax times, identification of an important community leader through adornment with prodigious amounts of shell beads (such as the early Chaakkax adult male, Burial 43, who was in terred with 2,019 shell beads), apparently was no longer consid ered to be an effective way of marking identities of authority. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Active shell-bead production documented for the Middle Forma tive and the earlier half of the Late Formative periods at K'axob agrees with patterns noted elsewhere in the Maya lowlands at such sites as Colha (Buttles 1992:156; Dreiss 1982, 1994; Potter 1982), Uaxactun (Kidder 1947), Nakbe (Hansen 1992), possibly Cahal Pech (Awe 1992:323), and farther afield in the Formative</page><page sequence="9">Shell ornaments from K'axob 125 Table 5.

From nearby Cuello, ironically, there is a "paucity of waste marine raw material" (Hammond 1991:185) and appar ently few irregularly shaped beads or shell-piercing stone tools. At K'axob, early beads were produced from both marine and fresh water shell, and thus indicate the existence of means of acquiring Ca ribbean shell (probably through trading networks) prior to the emergence of Cerros as a later Late Formative port of trade at the mouth of the New River. This finding agrees with those of López Varela (1996) and Angelini (1998), who independently determined through ceramic type variety analysis and petrographic analysis, re spectively, that early-facet Chaakkax (Middle Formative) pottery at K'axob shows large-scale regional affiliations. Many of the patterns presented here concur with those pre sented by Moholy-Nagy (1989, 1994) forTikal. For instance, that genera and species of shell were just as important as the intricacy of shell working. This statement is supported by the extremely lim ited distribution of difficult-to-acquire marine-shell species of Spon dylus and Oliva at K'axob. Like Tikal, Colha, Cuello, Cahal Pech, and Nakbe, Caribbean shell—particularly Strombus—is present at K'axob from the first settlement phase, but, unlike Tikal, in par ticular, evidence of freshwater species also is present in the earli est levels of K'axob in the form of Unionidae shell. Children were well adorned with shell during the earlier time periods, and evidence of this type of investment in children dimin ishes rather than expands during the later complexes of the Late Formative and Early Classic periods. This pattern is coincident with findings reported from Cuello (Hammond et al. 1995:121, 126), where well-adorned child burials have been excavated from Formative contexts. This trend lends support to Hayden's (1995) thesis that elaborate furnishings in child burials were common prior to the rise of ascriptive status and speak, rather, to adult invest ment in children. Variation in quantities of shell beads interred with Formative burials indicate the variety of identities of varying status that existed during the early and late facets of the Chaakkax and K'atabche'kax complexes. This fluidity is replaced, however, dur ing terminal K'atabche'kax times by shell artifacts that dia critically mark positions of status and authority. Shell continued to express identity, but within an increasingly formalized author ity structure in which ritual performance played a key role. In short, the means by which worked shell was socially and sym bolically entangled in the manner suggested by Thomas (1991) and Appadurai (1986) is shown to have been historically contin gent and to reveal more than a simple amplification of status signification. RESUMEN Los mayas utilizaron y valoraron las conchas como fuente de materia prima para la confección de adornos y prendas personales. El estudio de alhajas hechas en concha, encontradas en contextos domésticos y funer arios del período formativo en la aldea de K'axob, sugiere que los mayas elaboraron identidades eternas a través de su uso como ofrendas dentro de entierros de infantes y adultos. Tales identidades proyectan conceptos de rango, belleza, además de conductas paternales hacia los niños, patrones que han sido igualmente documentados en otros yacimientos del área maya. Nuestro análisis identificó, además, cambios cronológicos en la manufac tura de alhajas y ornamentos de concha, en la selección de ciertas espe cies y usos culturales. Al igual que en otros asentamientos mayas, tanto la especie de concha como la complejidad de la prenda son característi cas principales asociadas a los contextos de las élites o personajes prin cipales. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We wish to acknowledge the help and assistance of all those involved with the K'axob Project, particularly during the period from 1990 to 1993, dur ing which excavations were conducted into the Formative deposits of K'axob. Funding for the K'axob Project has been provided by the Na tional Science Foundation (BNS 9112310) and the Office of International Programs. Boston University. Early coding of the worked shell from K'axob that provided the foundation for this analysis was undertaken by Jessica Streibel and Sam Sweitz. The careful excavation of Burial 43 by Eleanor Harrison allowed the fine-grained analysis of 2,019 beads and their ana tomical associations. This study would not have been possible without the Organization of American States graduate fellowship (44550) awarded to Ilean Isel Isaza Aizpurua.</page><page sequence="10">126 isaza Aizpurúa and McAnany REFERENCES Andrews, E.
