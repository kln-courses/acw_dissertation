<plain_text><page sequence="1">(12) A BAS-RELIEF OF SEKHEMRE'-SEWADJTOWE SEBKHOTPE By HENRI WILD IN January I946 M. H. Dufour, antiquities dealer in Cairo, showed me two fragments of a bas-relief of which he is the owner and which he has placed just at the side of his FIG. I. shop in the garden of Shepheard's Hotel, exactly at the south-east corner of this build- ing. These two fragments, of similar dimensions, have been set at some distance from one another on either side of a window. At the first glance, however, it is clear that they formerly constituted one and the same panel, decorated with a double offering</page><page sequence="2">PLATE IV 'I . J· 1: .., I. RELIEF OF KING SEBKHOTPE III FROM AN ALTAR AT SEHEL 2. DRAWING BY W. J. BANKES OF A RELIEF AT SEHEL</page><page sequence="3">BAS-RELIEF OF SEKHEMREc-SEWADJTOWt SEBKHIOTPE scene. It seems very probable that this panel has been used recently as the base of a rotating mill. The two tableaux, perfectly symmetrical, show a king presenting a vase to the two female deities of the First Cataract, on the left, Satis, goddess of the island of Elephantine, on the right, Anukis, goddess of the island of Sehel. The two cartouches in the scene on the right, incomplete though they are, permitted me to identify the king as Sekhemrec-sewadjtowe Sebkhotpe. As the greater number of the inscriptions of this sovereign are to be found upon usurped monuments,' this bas-relief, damaged though it is, is of particular interest, since it is certainly con- temporaneous with this king; not the slightest hollowing out of the surface or any other signs of reuse appear in the cartouches. I decided to await an opportunity to make this little discovery known. By a curious coincidence, at the end of the same year, 1946, M. F. Laming Macadam brought to light, from among the Bankes MSS., a copy of the original monument made a century and a quarter ago (see JEA 32, pl. 8, bottom, with a commentary, p. 60, B). When one compares this copy with my own drawing (fig. i) and with my photographs (pl. IV, i), which M. Dufour has been kind enough to permit me to publish, no doubt remains as to the identification of the drawing from the Bankes MSS. with the original now in Cairo. In spite of the inaccuracy of many details in the old copy, this remains as a very valuable document, since it shows the bas-relief uninjured. However, a collation of it with the monument itself shows the following errors in the drawing: (a) The king in both scenes wears the uraeus on his forehead. (b) A narrow groove has been cut along the lower jaw of the sovereign who is here worshipping Satis (on the left), as though to indicate a line of whiskers. (c) In both scenes, the royal loin-cloth is completed at the front of the waist by a loop of some sort. (d) Actually the fingers of the two royal figures are not drawn in detail all their length, but the finger-tips are very slightly indicated. (e) The two royal figures were closer to one another than the sketch from the Bankes MSS. would indicate, so that the end of the tail of the one is super- imposed upon the tail of the other. (f) The bust of the goddess Anukis presents a much more feminine appearance and the shoulder straps holding her robe are wider in the original. (g) The feet of all four personages show the arch, which is not indicated in the draw- ing by Bankes. (h) Each of the two vases being offered to the deities has a rim or, more probably, is closed by means of a flat lid. (i) The cartouches in the inscription accompanying the offering to Anukis (on the right) must be interchanged. Concerning this last point, there is no doubt that it is the result of an error committed Cf. Cottevieille-Giraudet, Medamoud: mon. du Moyen Empire, pp. 8 f.; Weill, in Rev. 1g. anc. 2, 168 (list of these monuments on pp. 170 f.) and in Bull.

Moreover, the Bankes drawings show these two cartouches in their proper order in the left part of the scene (cartouches which have disappeared from the original) and upon another fragment of the same monument published by M. F. Laming Macadam (loc. cit., top). This second fragment comes from one of the smaller sides of an altar (?) of which the Bankes MSS. also contains a sketch. It shows the king wearing the crown of Upper Egypt and receiving the blessings of two anthropomorphic gods. If the one on the right is indeed Khnum, despite an erroneous writing of his name, that on the left seems to me unlikely to be a second god with the head of a ram.' It is more probably the god Seth, as the representative god of Upper Egypt ;2 the absence of a horn and the shape of the snout in the drawing would permit such an interpretation. If this indeed be the case, it is possible that upon the opposite side of the monument the king wore the crown of Lower Egypt and was attended by Khnum and Horus, the latter as the representative god of Lower Egypt.3 Moreover, a late expression kbhw Sth, 'the water-flow of Seth', seems to designate the cataract of Elephantine as the southern limit of the country.4 It is now possible to reconstruct the texts accompanying these two scenes and to give a translation of them.

An example is provided by Mariette, Abydos, I, pi. 45, No. 29 (quoted by Badawi, Der Gott Chnum, 50). But there are also texts mentioning three, six, and seven Khnums (ibid.). 2 Concerning this role of the god Setho, see Roscher , s.v. ;'Set' . , pp 7 d . f (G. Roeder). 3 Several monuments from the Middle Empire represent Horns and Seth personifying Lower and Upper Egypt: (a) on the throne of Sesostris I, they tie to the sign I the heraldic plants of the two kingdoms, Horus holding the papyrus and Seth the lotus (cf. Gautier and Jequier, Licht, figs. 33-7, pp. 35-7); (b) on two sed-festival porches found at El-Medimud and consecrated respectively to Sesostris III and Amenemhet- Sebkhotpe, Seth grants a million years to the King of Upper Egypt and Horus does likewise to the King of Lower Egypt (cf. Bisson de la Roque and collab., Medamoud, t. vii, pi. 4 = t. viii, pi. 8; t. vi, p. 59, fig. 48 = t. VIII, pl. IO). 4 Cf. Sethe, Urgeschichte, 75 f. 5 For this rendering of w;s cf.

The mention of 'Sehel' as the place of origin of these two bas-reliefs is certainly acceptable, since the gods who are represented on them are those of the First Cataract. The word 'granite' in Bankes's notes should, however, be replaced by the word 'sand- stone'. The following are the dimensions of the double fragment in the Dufour collection: height (not including the thin, roughly cut base): left, 120 cm.; right, 127 cm. width: left, 97 cm.; right, 8I cm. In the left scene the king is 852 cm. tall; in the right scene he is 86 cm. The slab is 52 cm. thick. With a view to the more or less recent use of the slab as the base of a rotating mill, the top and the left side of it have been intentionally broken off; in the middle, a hole about 14 cm. square has been cut through and a circular depression about 35 cm. in diameter has been countersunk around the hole. The arrangement permitted the builders of the mill to fix the nether millstone upon the slab by means of a central shaft. The upper millstone was held in place by means of a pivot and was operated by a horizontal bar. In order to assure the proper functioning of this mill, the slab could not exceed a certain size, so that the person or animal supplying the power might complete the circuit quickly. The thinness of the slab probably accounts for the fact that it broke in the middle; this must have happened soon after the stone was first employed for this purpose because the surface of it shows almost no wear. After it had been broken, the slab was useless and this is probably the reason why it was sold readily to the Swiss collector Bircher before it passed into the hands of the present owner.
