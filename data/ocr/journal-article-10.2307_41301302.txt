Stockholm: Svenska Institutet i Athen, 2009. Paper. ISBN: 978-91-7916-057-9. doi: 1 0. 1 0 1 7/S0009840X 1 1 00 1 752 In this volume Mycenaean figurines and figures, both anthropomorphic and zoomor- phic, are discussed with regard to contextual characteristics and possible functions or meanings. Some papers examine material excavated in a certain area while others focus more on general interpretation of the function and role of statuettes. Terracottas from particular sites and regions, including previously unpublished data, are presented by K. Demakopoulou and N. Divari-Valakou (pp. 37-53), K. Shelton (pp. 55-60), E. Weiberg (pp. 61-75), N. Petrovic (pp. 77-84), K. Pilafidis-Williams (pp. 113-24) and M.-L. Winbladh (pp. 177-91). Demakopoulou and Divari-Valakou's article is a re-examination of the figurine assemblage from the Greek sector of the Midea excavations in the light of material from the 2000-2004 seasons. Shelton provides a review of the material from Petsas' house at Mycenae, based on excavations from 1950-1 and a new project started in 2000, arguing that the figurines should be interpreted as a production deposit. Weiberg reviews anthropomorphic figurines from Mastos in Berbati, excavated in the 1930s and 1950s in the 'Potter's Quarter' area, and suggests that terracottas were produced here and then exported within the region and perhaps beyond. Weiberg argues that figurines should be studied like pottery, as made for exchange and trade. Zoomorphic figurines from the same site are studied by Petrovic. The majority of figurines, according to Petrovic, were found in their production context. Weiberg 's and Petrovic 's interpretation of the material is generally similar, but Petrovic is more cautious in drawing final conclusions. Pilafidis-Williams discusses the kourotrophos type of Mycenaean terracottas with special reference to the Sanctuary of Aphaea on Aegina. She argues that such figurines were specially commissioned, and not mass-produced. Winbladh discusses Mycenaean imports and figurines made in the Mycenaean tradition found in Khania (Crete) and suggests that imported figurines were used by Mycenaeans who came from the mainland. More theoretical and interpretative perspectives are offered in articles presented by E. French (pp. 15-21), I. Weber-Hiden (pp. 23-36), G. Albers (pp. 85-98), H. Whittaker (pp. 99-111), M. Guggisberg (pp. 125-38), L. Hammond (pp. 139-47), P. Pakkanen (pp. 149-59) and I. Tzonou-Herbst (pp. 161-75). French offers an overview of previous and current research in the field of Mycenaean figures and figurines. Weber-Hiden proposes a revised typology of the Mycenaean figurines, building on French's typology. Albers discusses figurines and figures found in the identified Mycenaean sanctuaries and their function and meaning based on spatial The Classical Review vol. 61 no. 2 © The Classical Association 201 1; all rights reserved</page><page sequence="2">584 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW distribution and context. Methodology is discussed in detail, and Albers proposes to use one based on the actual material, in opposition to methodology derived from other cultural-historical contexts. Whittaker argues that all the Mycenaean anthropomorphic figures should be interpreted as representations of deities. She highlights portability as an important factor in recognising the function of figures in cult rituals and postulates cult images being carried in processions. Guggisberg discusses the relationship between the wheelmade animal figurines from Mycenaean sanctuaries and animal sacrifices performed in these sites, differentiating between intramural and isolated sanctuaries. However, as Guggisberg notes, animals actu- ally sacrificed are mostly goats or sheep, whereas figurines usually depict cattle; this makes the argumentation less convincing. Hammond compares the functions and context of usage of figurines and miniature vessels, proposing that both types of objects should be interpreted mainly as votives connected with popular cult. Pakkanen examines figurines as agents and embodiments of social and religious power in ritual actions. This is the most theoretically focussed article. Tzonou- Herbst discusses figurines in their discard context, re-used as door stoppers or recycled in construction fills. Tzonou-Herbst postulates a use-life for figurines, with changing meanings invoked in their find contexts, and considers secondary context (discard) as providing valuable information. This is one of the most interesting articles in the volume, presenting a fresh approach to the material. Although, as is often the case with conference or seminar proceedings, not all the arguments presented are equally convincing, the overall importance of the volume is considerable. Both for presenting previously unpublished primary material and for discussing new methodological approaches the volume should be of interest for scholars studying Mycenaean figures and figurines.
