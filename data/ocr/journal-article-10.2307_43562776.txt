<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sekar Anyar: An Exploration of Meaning in Balinese gamelan Sue Carole DeVale and I Wayan Dibia The design and morphology of gamelan instruments in Java and Bali are im- portant resources for an investigation of meaning in gamelan traditions. Earlier investigations of this kind have centered on Java. The analysis of individual design elements on instruments from many gamelan in Java has revealed that they, along with the music itself, are cosmological symbols.1 Vetter (1 986:1 36-7) draws our attention to a particular gamelan, Kangjeng Kyai Kancilbelik ("Most Venerable Mouse Deer in a Pond"), a gamelan pelog in the Kraton Yogyakarta. Its name is depicted in the unusual design theme on its wood stands, cases and resonators. Vetter relates the lore surrounding the origin of this gamelan, point- ing out that it explains the gamelan' s unusual name and its decorative motif and, that it exemplifies the relationship between gamelan and magical, supernatural powers. Only one gamelan has been explored in detail through the entirety of its design and morphology; namely, the gamelan from Cirebon (west Java, near the central Javanese border) brought to Chicago in 1 893 for the World's Columbian Exposi- tion and since housed there at Field Museum of Natural History.2 This gamelan has been shown to depict an image of the Hindu-Javanese triune cosmos, the triloka, and man's spiritual role within it (DeVale 1 977, 1 978). It was further inter- preted as a uniquely Javanese form of Hindu-Buddhist mandala, a spatial icon of the cosmos which incorporates the process of its continuous regeneration, an icon which is recreated temporally in Javanese gamelan music (DeVale [forthc.]).</page><page sequence="2">6 ■ the world of music 33(1) -1991 Investigation of this kind on Balinese gamelan has just begun. The basic prin- ciples and concepts underlying the morphology of all Balinese gamelan and the structure of Balinese music in time have been shown to be analogous to those underlying Balinese architecture and human movement in space (DeVale 1991). This paper represents a first attempt to investigate meaning in Balinese gamelan through the exploration of a specific gamelan. The gamelan that serves as the subject of this paper is Sekar Anyar, a gamelan gong kebyar acquired by Mantle Hood, in 1958, for the program in ethnomusicology at the University of California, Los Angeles.3 Mantle Hood shared with us his memories of the provenance of Sekar Anyar.4 Hood's search for a Balinese gamelan for UCLA was kindly guided by Cokorda Agung Mas. In their search through Bali for a gamelan, they discovered that a man from Kesiman had a gong kebyar, the one to become Sekar Anyar, made on speculation in 1 958. (The gamelan maker is unknown.) The man allowed Hood to choose whichever gongs he wanted from a group of 6 or 7, and Hood commis- sioned the man to have a pair of gender rambat and a trompong made by the same maker to add to the gamelan in order to expand its possible repertoire. In addition to its sound, Hood was delighted with the carving on the gamelan in which the main designs were larger in size than in many other gamelan he had seen; i.e., in his concern that the visual beauty of the gamelan be as accessible to the audience as its aural beauty, Hood knew from experience that the larger designs would read better on stage than a gamelan with intricate carving which can become unreadable at a distance. The "life giving" ceremony for the gamelan was held in the small village of Teges, near Peliatan, and, upon hearing the gamelan, someone remarked to Hood that it happened to be tuned in Colin Mc Phee's favorite variant of Balinese pelog scale, selisir. The privilege of naming the gamelan was given to Hood who studied the gamelan' s design very carefully before naming it. For some reason, which Hood does not recall, the performers for the ceremony were from north Bali. With Hood seated in the place of honor, the first piece began with a fortis- simo attack played simultaneously on most of the instruments. Hood said every- one present jumped in their seats, and for him "it was the loudest sound in my ears I had ever heard." As the first subject for an exploration of this kind, Sekar Anyar is ideal. Most newer gamelan are highly elaborate, contain multiple design themes, and are painted, gilded and carved with three-dimensional figures. Their complexity makes them less suitable as models for exploring the basic concepts that Inform gamelan. Sekar Anyar is unpainted, and the carving on all of its instruments is</page><page sequence="3">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar ■ 7 unified in design; i.e., the gamelan as a whole depicts a single conceptual matrix expressed through the use of relatively few and similar elements on most of its instruments. Thus, in its simplicity, Sekar Anyar serves as a clear model for a first exploration of meaning in gamelan through the design of its instruments. Process and Purpose This paper is as much about process as about product. It arises from a year- long discourse between two scholars with complementary points of view: insid- er (Dibia) and outsider (DeVale). We hope, in sharing our complementary per- spectives, that we may both inform and clarify the understanding of meaning in gamelan in ways that cannot be accomplished from only one perspective. We are by no means the first pair to cooperate in such a way. Studies that immedi- ately come to mind in the worlds of gamelan and dance are that of Hood and Susilo (1967), McDermott and Sumarsam (1975), and Bandem and deBoer (1 981 ). We wish to stress that we believe joint theoretical analyses of these types to be fundamentally important in their very nature.5 The discussion began with DeVale wishing to extend her investigation of sym- bolism and meaning in gamelan from Java to Bali, both for Bali itself, where Hindu-Buddhism is active, and to better understand the ways in which the Hindu-Buddhist underlayer still informs gamelan in now Muslim Java. Both scholars were aware of the corpus of work on symbolism and meaning of game- lan instruments and music in Java, and those few contributions to the same in Bali. From this corpus arose many of the questions that we sought to answer about Balinese gamelan.6 Throughout both the research and writing processes, there was constant feedback, input, and cross-checking by the two scholars; thus when either of them wished to propose an aspect to incorporate or contemplated an interpreta- tion, it was immediately and thoroughly debated with the other. DeVale asked about the terminology for the parts of gamelan instruments and the individual designs carved on them, which Dibia provided. DeVale conducted a detailed analysis and interpreted what they mean in their totality, an analysis Dibia corrob- orated. Then, based on DeVale's interpretation that the tiger-lion family of metal- lophones in the Field Museum gamelan from Java represents a human family physically, spiritually, and in their musical function (DeVale 1989b:101-6), Dibia explored the musical function of instruments in Balinese gamelan for evidence of family and social structure. Dibia has received corroboration for his resulting interpretation from other musician/scholars in Bali. Finally, DeVale applied the</page><page sequence="4">8 • the world of music 33(1) -1991 concepts underlying the terminology, morphology, and the design imagery on the instruments to the realization of gamelan music, an interpretation Dibia fully supported. We hoped our study would further exemplify DeVale's (1 990:22-7) theory that in order to fully understand meaning in musical instrument traditions, investiga- tion should begin with the instruments themselves. Such a study should open with analysis of the simplest physical aspects of the instruments, and end with the extension of the concepts uncovered through the instruments into an explo- ration of orchestration and musical structure. Dibia has a similar theory that in order to fully understand meaning in dance, one must study the concepts that underlie costumes, masks, and dance props as well as the movements per se (cf. , for example, Dibia 1 984 and 1 989). As a result of our study, our interpretation concludes that Balinese gamelan instruments are, through their design, symbol- ic depictions of macrocosm and microcosm ; and are, through their function and the music performed on them, icons of processes within and between them. In explicating, in this paper, how we arrived at our conclusions, we begin by explaining multiple cultural concepts that underlie the investigation of meaning in gamelan. We will then explain how these concepts operate in the function of the name given to the gamelan, Sekar Anyar, and in the morphology and termi- nology for gamelan instruments including their wood stands and cases, and their sounding parts. We follow with our investigation of how those concepts are expressed in the individual design elements and united into a single religio-aes- thetic theme. We will then turn our attention to the concepts that underlie the nature and function of Balinese gamelan music, and conclude our analysis with an investigation of those which underlie the musical function of instruments in the structure of Balinese gamelan music. The Primary Concepts that Underlie Meaning in Balinese gamelan Balinese gamelan traditions, including musical instruments and music, exhibit numerological concepts, especially an overwhelming "three-ness." They are examples of the myriad Balinese tripartite classifications underlying everything from cosmology to daily life. For example, one of the most prominent is the Tri- murti, the Hindu-Balinese Trinity of Brahma, Wisnu and Siwa. In the terminology of Balinese gamelan traditions, anthropomorphic and bo- tanical symbolism are evident. The tripartite anthropomorphism (primarily head, body and foot) demonstrates the metaphorical expression of the human body</page><page sequence="5">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar ■ 9 (from which all concepts and relationships initially arise) in architecture, musical instruments, and music.; i.e., human products in the human microcosm. The botanical terminology provides evidence of the metaphorical association of songs, musical sounds and musical instruments to flowers, leaves and trees. We focus further on tripartite systems which govern spatial relationships at both the macrocosmic and microcosmic levels. The Balinese macrocosm, the triloka, is seen as having three worlds, vertically ordered: the upper world of the gods, the svahloka ; the middle world of man, the bhvahloka' and the lower world of the spirits, the bhurloka.7 The concept of triangga (three parts or three places), which can further subdivide the middle world of man into three areas, is basically a horizontal ordering, but with altitude associations: mountain ( utama : lofty, exalted, or highest and purest place), middle land ( madya : middle or neutral place), and sea ( nista : least important, smallest or lowest and impure place). While the concept of triangga may not be commonly known by the Balinese general public, it still governs the basic layout of villages and the placement of houses and the temples within them, as well as the internal layout of house com- pounds and temples.8 For example, the temple of origin (dedicated to Brahma) is always built at the mountainward end of the village; the community temple (dedi- cated to Wisnu), the center of village activity, is in the center; while the temple of death (devoted to Siwa) is located at the seaward end. Similarly, the most sacred corner of each temple (and house ; i.e. the family shrine) is also the mountainward corner. This mountainward-center-seaward axis is technically named for compass directions (kaja-kelod, lit. "north-south"), but it is movable; it depends on which of the two sacred Balinese mountains one is referring to, and where the sacred mountain is in relationship to the village. Thus kaja-kelod is functionally hori- zontal; i.e., even if the mountainward end of the village is its lowest point physi- cally in terms of altitude, the temple for Brahma will still be built there. In addition to pure "three-ness," "nine-ness" (3x3) is also common in gamelan traditions. This is because Balinese tripartite classifications are often further subdivided by three. A simple example of the way in which "three-ness" be- comes "nine-ness" can be seen in the triangga ; its three major divisions of utama, madya, nista can be further subdivided by those same qualities into the highest, middle and lowest places (or pure, neutral, and impure places) within each. Nine-ness can also be seen in the center-periphery arrangement of eight around a center. This can represent the sanga mandala ("nine regions") or nawa</page><page sequence="6">10 • the world of music 33(1) - 1991 sanga ("nine nine;" i.e., nawa = Sanskrit nine, sanga = Balinese and Old Java- nese nine), the compass rose or rose of the winds, which delineates the eight cardinal directions plus center (Budihardjo 1 986:41 -2). The nawa sanga is more than earthly directions; it is a map of cosmological orientation and process which incorporates the deities assigned to each of the nine directions, and their atten- dant attributes including specific colors, days of the week, and organs of the human body (Zurbuchen 1987:51-4). Sekar Anyar: Name, Morphology and Terminology We begin our exploration of Balinese gamelan traditions by focusing on instru- ments of Sekar Anyar as objects of material culture. We investigate the names that are given to the gamelan as a whole, the structure and morphology of the instruments and the terminology for their parts. The Function of Names for Balinese gamelan Balinese gamelan ensembles and groups, like central Javanese gamelan, are frequently given names that in themselves have meaning. These names are often metaphors for the function or power of the sound of the gamelan. The meaning of the name "Sekar Anyar," that of the gamelan that serves as the model for our study, illustrates the prevalent metaphorical association in Bali between songs or musical sound and flowers. This will be further seen in this paper in the botan- ical references inherent in the terminology associated with gamelan instruments and musical structure. There are two possible translations for Sekar Anyar: "new flower" or "new song." Sekar can be translated as "flower" or "song;" anyar means "new." Since gamelan names relate to sound metaphorically rather than directly, the better literal translation of Sekar Anyar is "new flower;" i.e. newly bloomed flower. Its meaning may be interpreted as signifying that when this gamelan is played, it will have the power to entertain through the eyes and ears just as the beauty and fra- grance of a fresh blossom does through the eyes and nose. Morphology, Structure and the Terminology of Parts In this section we concentrate on identifying the "three-ness" and "nine-ness" in the basic morphology and structure of the instruments and in the terminology of the parts of instruments, both of the plawah, the wood stands, frames and</page><page sequence="7">DeVale/Dibia, Sekar Anyar ■ 1 1 III. 1 Schematic of a metallophone resonator case from Sekar Anyar showing its division into nine sections. III. 2 Schematic of a gong chime frame from Sekar Anyar showing its division into nine sections. cases for the instruments, and the bronze sounding parts. Both "three-ness" and "nine-ness" are seen in the basic morphology and structure of the plawah. "Three-ness" is prominent in the terminology in which both anthropomorphic and botanical symbolism are evident and sometimes combined. (1) The plawah Each plawah, whether for a gong chime or a metallophone, is divided into three primary sections both vertically and horizontally (3x3 or nine in total) (Illus- tration 1).9 Vertically, each metallophone has a central section and two end pieces. Horizontally, each of those sections is divided into three main sections. Each gong chime is similarly constructed (Illustration 2).</page><page sequence="8">12 • the world of music 33(1) - 1991 III. 3 Schematic of a metallophone resonator case from Sekar Anyar with the concept of triangga interpolated on its nine sections. The nine basic sections of gamelan instruments can be interpreted as repre- senting the concepts of triangga (Illustration 3). Most simply explained, each of the three vertical sections (right-center-left) represent the triangga, while the three horizontal divisions (top-middle-bottom) of the latter represent the division of the triangga into utama, madya and nista. The horizontal divisions also sug- gest the triloka with its upper, middle and lower worlds. The nine sections can also be interpreted as a center-periphery arrangement of eight around a center, representing the sanga mandala or nawa sanga, the compass rose or rose of the winds, which, we have explained above, incorporates cosmological orientation and deities and their function in cosmic process along with the eight earthly car- dinal directions plus center. The triangga, triloka, and nawa sanga underlie the construction of every Balinese house and temple.10 They also appear to underlie the basic morphology and structure of gamelan instruments.11 Theendpieces on all plawah are called tenggakpapah ; i.e., "bottom of a coco- nut leaf that sticks to the tree." The endpiece is so named because its shape resembles that of the leaf of a coconut tree when it dries on the tree. The termi- nology (both botanical and anthropomorphic in nature) for the three horizontal sections of the endpieces on all plawah are (1) bunga (lit. flowers, considered the head), (2) awak (body), and (3) batís (foot). Each of these three sections can be divided into three subsections (Illustration 4).</page><page sequence="9">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar ■ 13 III. 4 Schematic of the endpiece (tenggak papah) of a metallophone resonator of SekarAnyar showing its three major divisions further subdivid- ed into three parts. The three horizontal divisions of the center of the metallophones on Sekar Anyar are also each subdivided into three subsections (Illus- tration 5):12 the top (A) includes (1) the bronze bars, (2) the piece of wood below them into which the pins, upon which the bars are sus- pended, are inserted, and (3) the thin strip of wood which separates the top section from (B) the central section, which consists of (1) top border, (2) central panel, and (3) bottom border, and (C) the base, including (1) the thin piece of wood separating it from the central section, (2) the thick middle section of the base, and (3) the bottom strip. This nine-part subdivision of the endpieces and center sections of the metallophones is an example of how Balinese tripartite classifi- cations are expandable virtually infinitely by threes (3, 9, 27, etc.); thus the total number of sections on the metallophone plawah is 27. Other plawah also exhibit "three-ness" and "nine-ness." The center of the trompong, a two-octave gong chime with ten gongs, is also divided into three sections, each with three subsections. Gongstands (tungguh or canggah), too, are tripartite in every aspect (Illustration 6). The yoke consists of three parts: two vertical stanchions and the cross-beam (sanan; i.e. "the stick to carry the gong on"). The base is also tripartite with two endpieces and a cross bar for support. Looking at a gongstand from endview again reveals tripartite symmetry, from low to high, the endpiece of the base, the vertical stanchion, and the decorative finial (jampongarr, lit. "bunch of flowers") through which the cross-beam is threaded. Like the metallophone and gong chime plawah, the gongstand, with</page><page sequence="10">III. 5 The sideview of a kantilan, a metallophon in SekarAnyar. the gong, can be interpreted as incorporating the triangga, the triloka, and the nawa sanga : the eight pieces of the stand surrounding the gong as center. (2) The Bronze Gongs In Balinese gamelan, like Javanese gamelan, there are two kinds of bronze sounding parts: gongs and bars. The Balinese name three parts for each gong, whether it is one of the vertically hung gongs, or one of those that is horizontally suspended either individually or in one of the two gong chimes, reyong and trom- pong (cf. Illustration 7a): (1) the boss of a gong is called moncol (lit. "knob"), (2) the shoulders or flat surface surrounding the boss is called lambe (lit., the "lip" as of the mouth), and (3) the sides are called batís gong (lit., "foot of the gong"). These three parts can also be interpreted as anthropomorphic representations of head, body and foot.</page><page sequence="11">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar ■ 15 III. 6 Schematic of a gongstand from SekarAnyar showing its tripartite divisions. Each of the individual hanging and horizontally suspended gongs within a Balinese gamelan has its own name, while the gong kettles of the gong chimes are known as don reyong{"re- yong leaf") or don trompong (" trom - pong leaf") as the case may be. (3) The Bronze Bars In the same way that a gong is con- sidered to be tripartite with boss, shoulders, and sides, we suggest that the bronze bars can also be viewed as tripartite with (1) top and (2) sloping sides, and (3) outer vertical sides (Illus- trations 7b and 7c).13 We interpret the bottom of the bar ( bilah , lit. "bar" or "slab") as no more a separate part than is the underside of a gong. Each bar is suspended over an individual bamboo tube resonator fitted inside the plawah. Because of their suspension, the instruments with five or ten bars in Sekar Anyar are called gangsa gantung (lit. "hanging bronze"). There are two other metallophones added to Sekar Anyar to be used for a genre known as "legong" dances. These instruments are known as gender rambat, i.e., the term gender is the name of the instrument perse, while rambat ("weaving vine") refers to the technique performers use to expand the melody on it. Each bronze bar within a metallophone in a Balinese gamelan is known as bunga gangsa (lit. "flower of bronze"), don (lit. "leaf"), or don gangsa (lit., "leaf of bronze"). The Artistic Design and Decoration of the plawah In this section, we analyze the artistic designs carved into the frames, stands and resonator cases (plawah) for the instruments: individually and together as a design theme.14 In its totality, the artistic design of Sekar Anyar represents the Balinese macrocosm, the triloka, with its three worlds: those of the gods and dei- fied ancestors, humans, and evil spirits. The imagery inherent in Sekar Anyar is interpreted as parallel to one of the most vital icons of the macrocosm in Balinese culture: the Kayonan, the most important and powerful shadow puppet which</page><page sequence="12">16 • the world of music 33(1) - 1991 rV f III. 7a-c The three elements of the bronze sounding parts: A the gongs, B the higher- pitched metallophone bars, and C the lower-pitched metallophone bars. incorporates the cosmic tree of life. As will be shown, it is not only the decoration of the plawah which are symbolic through the terminology and meaning assigned to them, the sounding parts of the instruments are also essential components of tree of life imagery. The Design on the plawah of the Metallophones In this section, the individual design elements on the plawah of the metallophones are identified and analyzed. These designs, some endogenousiy Balinese, some syn- cretized from designs with Western or Indian origins, are shared by all sixteen metallophones in Sekar Anyar. The totality of the design on the metallophones is then interpre- ted as parallel to that of the Kayonan.15 (1) The Individual Design Elements The decorative carving on the plawah of each metallophone falls into three groupings, those on its base, center and endpieces. We begin with the base of the metallophones, by which we mean its entire base, including the bottom of both center and endpieces. On the very bottom strip of each metallophone is a border pattern of circle and rod designs called batun timun, "seeds of the cucumber" (cf. Illustrations 8a and 9 bottom). The seeds of the cucumber represent seeds planted in the ground. On the next and thicker section of the base are carved snail designs (kakul-kakulan, "representing snails") interspersed both with water bubbles and Balinese-style single flower (bunga) blossoms, the latter seemingly unattached from stem and plant (cf. Illustrations 8b, 8c and 9).16 The snails are creatures of both land, the middle world, and sea, the lower world. The single blossoms can be thought of</page><page sequence="13">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar ■ 17 III. 8 Individual design elements carved on the instruments of Sekar Anyar. as those which fall upon the ground, either naturally or through human action: those which purposefully fall from the hands of worshippers after praying (muspa) in a temple, or those deliberately placed upon the ground (along with rice) as offerings to conciliate the evil spirits of the lower world. In their combined imagery, the snails, water bubbles and floating flowers could also be called tata- manan, (lit., "representing a garden or park") a pond or water garden, where snails live and flowers grow: blossoms sometimes falling off their stems and floating on the water, or literally blooming on the surface of the water as lotuses do. Thus the seeds, the snail, water and flower designs on the base of the metal- lophones signify the middle world of humans and suggest the lower world of evil spirits. The large center panels of all the metallophones are carved with a complete plant including flowers, branches and leaves in a pattern known as patra blanda ("blanda pattern") (cf. again Illustration 9). This style of rendering flowers and leaves is taken from Dutch designs that the Balinese acculturated; the root of</page><page sequence="14">18- the world of music 33(1) - 1991 III. 9 Closeup of the central panel of an ugal, a metallophone in Sekar Anyar. blanda is quite probably blanda ("blond"), a term the Balinese use to refer to all Westerners. The pattern is also referred to as "patra olanda" ("Dutch" or "Hol- land pattern"). The central flower and leaf design is completely surrounded by a border composed of patra mesir ("Egyptian pattern"), known in the Western world as a form of "Greek key" design (cf. Illustrations 8d and 9). The border itself is studded at its four corners and the centers of both its top and bottom with a self-contained design known as emas-emasan ("representing gold") (cf. Illustra- tions 8e and 9); gold is a symbol of dignity and wealth. The long narrow strip at the top of the center section of the metallophone cases, just below the bronze bars and into which bronze pegs are hammered (pegs from which the bars are suspended on thin ropes), is also carved with patra blanda (cf. Illustration 9). A plant design is most appropriate for the center section of a metallophone where the bronze bars are suspended; they are bunga and don gangsa : flowers and leaves of bronze. The remaining two primary sections of the endpieces of the metallophones to be analyzed are their heads and bodies (the third, its base or foot, has already been described above). The heads and the top of the bodies of the metallophone endpieces (Illustration 10) are carved in patra blanda-, however, the heads are</page><page sequence="15">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar ■ 19 III. 10 Endpiece of a kantilan, a metallophone in SekarAnyar. deeply carved with flowers and leaves, while the narrow body tops are more shallowly carved with them; i.e., the shallow carving of the latter is identical to the character of the patra blanda carving on the central panels. The bot- tom of the bodies of the endpieces are carved with designs unique to them among the gamelan's instruments; each is carved with the face of two mythological crows (karang guak, lit. "face of a crow"), complete with eyes and canine teeth, each face placed so that its center is exactly on a corner of the foot and is wrapped around it (Illus- tration 11). Thus if one looks at the bottom of the body of a metallophone endpiece from front or back view, one sees only the profile of a single crow; if one looks at the body from endview, one sees the profiles of two crows' heads back-to-back; but if one looks at the body from corner view, one sees a complete crow's face in three dimen- sions. The faces of crows are found in other art forms in addition to the endpieces of gamelan. They are sometimes carved into the tops of the pillars in buildings. The heads of birds are also found as ornaments on shadow puppets and on dance costumes. These represent Garuda, the mythological sun eagle, or the crow, who the Balinese often say is Garuda in another form (Hobart 1 987:95). As artistic designs, the heads of these birds are known as karang guak as we stated above, and Garuda mungkur, literally "Garuda at the back."</page><page sequence="16">20 ■ the world of music 33(1) - 1991 III. 1 1 Crow's faces on the foot of the endpiece of a jublag, a metallophone in SekarAnyar. The "back" is exactly where the heads of these birds frequently occur on the headdresses of powerful figures in wayang, whether performed by puppets or human actors. The birds also face backwards on the headdresses, as if they were guarding the powerful figures from the rear. Hobart (1987:95) informs us that "these bird heads primarily connote supernatural power." (2) The Metallophone plawah and the Kayonan Considered as a totality, the design elements on the metallophones of Sekar Anyar can be seen to be parallel to those of the Kayonan, the image of the triloka vital to wayang. We begin our comparative analysis of Sekar Anyar/Kayonan imagery by re-examining the central panels on the metallophones which are filled with flowers and roots carved in patra blanda (cf. again Illustration 9). While patra blanda is a style of rendering flowers adopted from the Dutch, their execu-</page><page sequence="17">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar • 21 III. 12 The elements of the Hindu composite tree of life as they appear in art (after Bosch 1960).</page><page sequence="18">22 • the world of music 33(1) - 1991 tion on the central panel of the metallophones appears to imply a deeper level of meaning ; i.e., the form and arrangement of the branches, flowers and leaves can be interpreted as a Hindu form of cosmic "tree of life" with both male and female elements. F. D. K. Bosch (1960:50-60) explains that in Indo-Hindu and Hindu-Javanese art and literature, the tree is represented as a composite of male ( agni : creative breath, fire) and female ( soma : primeval waters) elements. He adds (Bosch 1960:79): it is an indivisible cosmic unit, which does not, however, exclude either of them from having its own organs or from following its own habits of growing. Thus the tri-lobed root of the fig-male element (the upper half of the tree)(cf. Illus- tration 12) grows in heaven and its branches curl down to earth, while the tri- lobed root of the lotus-female element (the lower half of the tree) grows in water and its leaves, stems, and flowers point upward. The Kayonan (root = kayu, tree), the leaf-shaped shadow puppet and primary prop of wayang kulit (shadow plays), is an icon of the cosmos, and the Hindu- Baiinese tree of life is the primary image upon it. In his preparations before a way- ang performance, the dalang (philosopher, puppeteer, "priest") recites the man- tra Kayonan to himself as one of the last of a series of private "'unheard' lan- guage acts" (Zurbuchen 1987:125-34) to direct cosmic power through himself "just prior to the first appearance on the screen of the Kayonan, the 'world tree'" (Zurbuchen 1987:132) with which he opens a play. Zurbuchen (1987:132) ex- plains: "Nowhere is this function of directing cosmic forces toward immediate dramatic and vocal ends clearer" than in this mantra. She adds (ibid.)-. Holding the elaborately carved tree-figure before his face, the dalang begins a counterclockwise naming of the nawasanga deities, which are said to one by one merge together, ultimately becoming part of the Kayonan which itself "returns to," or is subsumed by, a transcendent cognitive and creative force The Kayonan mantra is thus a distillation of the various directional forces into one vocal power in the service of wayang performance. The Kayonan is thus both a powerful vehicle for, and an icon of, cosmic process, incorporating the nawa sanga within it. The "elaborate carving" of the Kayonan, in which the deities of the nawasanga with their attributes merge into one, is that of a composite Hindu tree of life, but in Bali, the male and female elements share a single tri-lobed root and trunk. While Kayonan vary from one another in subtle details of design, basic elements, such as those on the Kayonan described here, are common to most. We begin with the upper part of the Kayonan (Illustration 13). Shooting upward from the</page><page sequence="19">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar ■ 23 III. 13 Schematic of the designs on a Kayonan (drawn after one in the private collection of Sue Carole DeVale). trunk is the upper part of the tree (male) with all of its primary branches curling downward, its innermost and outermost sub-branches each encircling a single leaf or flower bud. Below the male elements of the tree, and at the base of the same trunk, a second plant emerges, the female lotus which grows in cosmic waters: its giant flower on the trunk, its stems extending outward with their huge leaves pointing upward. On this Kayonan, the tri-lobed root at the very base of the trunk is represented by a tri-lobed design (here with gilding added) known as gunung-gunungan ("representing mountain"), a symbol of the sacred mountain. On either side of the root are two pairs of additional (but not gilded) gunung- gunungan. At the lower end of the Kayonan is the gate at the top of the sacred mountain; that is, the gate to the upper world where the tree of life grows and where the gods reside. At the base of the mountain symbols on the Kayonan, and just above and to the right and the left of the gate, are profiles of the head of Garuda in crow form, with only a single eye. Along the entire base of the gate are kakul-kakulan ("representing snails"), symbols of the earth and sea, the middle world of man and the lower world of evil spirits, both outside the gates.</page><page sequence="20">24 • the world of music 33(1) - 1991 The designs on the metallophones can be seen to also represent the compos- ite cosmic tree (cf. Illustration 1 4). The flowers and leaves on the center panel are arranged so that they too have downward curling branches (male) and upward pointing buds and fully-opened blossoms (female), arising, like the cosmic tree on the Kayonan, from a single tri-lobed root. On the metallophones the root is symbolized by a leaf with its tip turned upward against itself, just below the giant flower at the bottom of the central panel and just above the tatamanan, with its watery pond from which the root seems to grow, carved along the base. Thus, it appears that the Dutch style of rendering flowers and leaves has been interpolat- ed on an ancient androgynous Hindu-Balinese form of tree-of-life with its partic- ular arrangement of male and female components (compare Illustrations 1 2 and 1 4). The crows' heads near the bottom of both endpieces of the metallophones, and the kakul-kakulan along its entire base, seem to mirror their placement on the Kayonan (compare Illustrations 1 1 and 13). It has already been shown that the composite nine sections of the metallo- phones could well represent the nawa sanga and the triloka/triangga as the Kayonan does. In their botanical imagery, their fertile ponds, their snail patterns, and their crows' heads, the designs on the metallophones are strikingly similarto those on the Kayonan. As such, like the Kayonan, they can be interpreted as indi- vidual or multiple icons of the universe. The Designs on the Remaining plawah The designs on the rest of the instruments of Sekar Anyar all include imagery of the tree of life like that found on the metallophones. The two gong chimes, trom- pong and reyong, also incorporate the faces of powerful figures who are guard- ian/protectors. Finally, the decoration on the gongstand represents the Indo- Hindu padmamula (Bosch 1960:42, 106 ff.), the tri-lobed root or tri-lobed jewel, the symbol of the Trimurti: Brahma, Wisnu and Siwa. (1) The Design Elements on the Smaller Individual Instruments The smaller individual instruments to be discussed here are those that have their own stands or are otherwise separate instruments: the kajar (from ajar, "to teach") the single horizontal gong which marks every beat of a gamelan compo- sition ; the ceng-ceng, the cymbal sets which add rhythmic accents; and the ken- dang, a pair of truncated conical, two-headed drums which lead tempo, duration and dynamics. The stand for the kajaris decorated with patra blanda flowers and leaves which represent the tree of life (Illustration 1 5A). The base of the ceng-</page><page sequence="21">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar • 25 III. 14 The floral design on the central panel of a pemade , a metallophone in Sekar Anyar.

The body of the ceng-ceng stand, to which the bottom halves of the cymbal pairs are attached, is incised with a leaf design (karang don, face or pattern of leaf) strongly reminiscent in shape of the leaves carved in patra blanda elsewhere on the gamelan. The two kendang in a Balinese gamelan are not carved or decorated in any way; however, for perfor- mance, they are dressed: their bodies wrapped entirely in cloth, either with a large black and white check design, or solid black cloth with a red border, both symbolizing the myriad dualities of the universe such as good/evil, male/female, macrocosm/microcosm etc. (2) The Design Elements on the Gong Chimes The two gong chimes of Sekar Anyar, the trompong and the reyong, are our next subjects for analysis. Most of the individual design elements are present on both gong chimes; thus we will thoroughly analyze the trompong (Illustration 16), and then point out only the differences on the reyong. Since the center sections of the gong chimes of Sekar Anyar do not touch the ground like they do on many gong chimes in other Balinese gamelan, there is no continuous base on the gong chimes of Sekar Anyar.17 Therefore the design elements on the gong chimes are discussed in two rather than three groups; i.e., as those on the central panel and those on the endpieces, each with its own base, center and top. The central panel of the trompong can be seen as having nine layers of designs, three each for its base, center and top (Illustration 1 7). Starting from the bottom, the base of the central section has a border row of a scalloped or wavy pattern probably signifying water. The second is kakul-kakulan interspersed with water bubbles, in the same form as we saw it on the metallophones; it is the tata- manan again, but on the trompong, no blossoms float on the pond. The third row is batu-batuan ("representing rock") (Illustration 1 8a), often used as a border pat- tern, which signifies the earth. The fourth row, which begins the center section, is the widest strip of design on the panel and consists of patra blanda, again sug- gesting the tree of life with primarily downward curling branches and upward</page><page sequence="23">III. 1 7 Closeup of the central section on the trompong. pointing flowers. The fifth row is thin and carved in a simple design (ceracap), with downward pointing leaves of alternately large and small size (Illustration 18b). The sixth row appears to be an elaboration on emas-emasan. The seventh row, which begins the top portion of the central panel is a thin row of kakul-kakulan ("representing snails"), here in its form as a border pattern. The eighth row is patra mesir, the Greek key design. The ninth and top row consists of sixteen triangular pieces, alternating large and small sizes of them, filled with patra punggal, a traditional Balinese herbaceous design composed of densely placed curls and swirls. In the bottom center of each piece is a tripartite "spade- like" design (Illustration 18c), representing what is called in Indo-Hindu culture padmamula (Bosch 1 960: 42, 1 06 ff.), the tri-lobed root of the cosmic tree, which in turn, symbolizes the tri-lobed jewel, the Trimurti: Brahma, Wisnu, Siwa. These triangular pieces at the top of the trompong, with their rounded sides, could be interpreted as leaves pointing to the upper world. They are also strongly reminis- cent of the shape of the top portion of the Kayonan and, especially with the pres- ence of the padmamula, could be interpreted as individual representations of the tree of life and the primary gods in the upper world. The reyong is nearly identical to the trompong. However, the reyong has only seven instead of nine rows of designs on its central panel, because it is shorter in</page><page sequence="24">28 • the world of music 33(1) - 1991 III. 1 8 Individual design elements carved on the gong chimes of Sekar Anyar. height (and longer in length because it has more gongs) than the trompong. From the bottom the rows of designs on the central section of the reyong (Illustration 19) are: (1) batu-batuan, (2) what appears to be second form of batu-batuan, (3) patra blanda, (4) emas-emasan as a border pattern, (5) kakul-kakulan as a border pattern, (6) patra mesir, and (7) at the top, are the rounded triangular pieces of patra punggal but without the padma- mula. In the very center of central panels of both trompong and reyong, and nearly as tall as the entire panel, Is the three-dimensional carving of the face of Bath. The image of the face of Bath is also known as karang sae ("face of sae").18 Bath is a powerful guardian whose image is often found in temples on the doors, all sides</page><page sequence="25">III. 19 Closeup of the central section on the reyong of Sekar Anyar showing the face and hands of Bath. or bases of sacred shrines; he thus protects them. On shrines, where he bars the entry of impure or evil spirits, his face is often depicted with his hands on either side, palms showing and fingers pointing up in the nearly universal "stop, do not come closer" signal. In his depiction on the center of the reyong ( cf. again Illus- tration 19), Bath is seen with his hands grasping the leaves which represent the tree of life, and at the very top of his headdress is incised "1 958," the year Sekar Anyar was made. The feet of the endpieces on the trompong are decorated with three layers of design. Starting from the bottom (Illustration 20) is (1) a row of batun timun, (2) a row of scalloped or wavy water designs, and (3) a row of kakul-kakulan interspersed with water bubbles, again the tatamanan imagery. The body of the endpieces also has three layers of design. The bottom layer consists of batu-batuan as a border pattern. The middle layer is carved with a very thick row of gunung-gunungan (representing mountain) found also on the Kayonan at the base of the tree of life. In the center of each representation of gunung-gunungan on the trompong is the padmamula (Illustration 18d). They constitute a triple symbol of</page><page sequence="26">30 • the world of music 33(1) - 1991 III. 20 The endpiece of the trom pong ; sideview.</page><page sequence="27">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar ■ 31 (1) the sacred mountain, (2) the tri-lobed root of the tree of life, either of which in turn can represent (3) the tri-lobed jewel, the Trimurti. The narrow top layer of the body of the endpieces is carved with patra mesir. The head of the endpieces, from sideview, are carved with patra blanda. From end- view, however (Illustration 21), we again see a three-dimensional carving of the face of Bath. Like the central sections, the endpieces of the reyong are almost identical in design to those of the trompong. Because the reyong is much shorter in height than the trompong, the feet of the reyong endpieces differ; they consist of only a single row of batun timun, which is, however bordered on top and bottom with a thinner uncarved row. There is no water or kakul-kakulan on its feet. The gunung- gunungan designs on the lower part of the body of the reyong do not incorporate the padmamula, and its narrow upper body is decorated with emas-emasan instead of patra mesir. However, the face of Bath is carved into each endpiece of the reyong, just as it is on those of the trompong. The presence of the images of Bath, the protector, on all exposed sides of the gong chimes, and that of the tri-lobed jewel representing the Trimurti, strongly suggests that the space within the gamelan (i.e., that outlined by its instruments set up for performance) is a sacred or at least a protected space like Balinese sacred shrines. (3) The Gongstand and Gongs There are four identical gongstands (tungguh) in Sekar Anyar, two large and two small (Illustration 22), from which all the individual hanging gongs are suspended. For performance, the four gongstands are set up in a square; a single performer sits in the center of the square and plays all the gongs. The two large gongstands, on each of which hangs one of the two gong ageng, are set up opposite each other, as are the two smaller gongstands, one with the bende (the only Balinese gong with an inverted boss), the other with the similar-sized kem- pur and the small kemong. Except for the bende which provides rhythmic accent, the hanging gongs are used for the colotomic structure of Balinese gamelan music. The two gong ageng alternately mark the ends of each phrase as well as the beginning and ending of each composition; the smaller hanging gongs punctuate and thus subdivide the phrases. As we analyzed above, the nine-part morphology and structure of the gongstands (including the gongs as</page><page sequence="28">32 • the world of music 33(1) - 1991 III. 2 1 The endpiece of the trompong : endview showing the face of Bath.</page><page sequence="29">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar ■ 33 III. 22 Gongs, gongstands and drums of SekarAnyar. center), like those of the plawah, may be interpreted as representing the tri- angga, the triloka, and the nawa sanga. Only two parts of each gongstand are decorated, the pieces ( ¡ampongan , lit. "bunch of flowers") which top each of the two stanchions, and through which the sanan (lit. "the stick to carry the gong") is threaded. The carving on all the jam- pongan is identical (Illustration 23). On the surface, it is composed entirely of patra punggal, with padmamula symbols at the centers of both top and bottom; but there is more to the jampongan than those design elements. The carving on the jampongan appears to serve as a classic example of the practice of hiding faces in vegetative forms in Hindu-Javanese and Hindu-Balinese art. The jam- pongan can be seen to hide the face of Kala (Illustration 24), complete with horns, eyes, nose, beard and mouth, the latter the hole for the stick that carries the gong. Kala, an offspring of Siwa, often represents Siwa's destructive side. Thus the patra punggal and the padmamula on the surface of the jampongan symbolize the tri-lobed root/tri-lobed jewel of Brahma, Wisnu and Siwa (in Bali-</page><page sequence="30">34 • the world of music 33(1) - 1991 III. 23 The decorative piece (jampongan ) at the top of a gongstand stanchion in Sekar Anyar. III. 24 Outline of the top piece (jampongan) of a gongstand stanchion interpreted to reveal the hidden face of Kala.</page><page sequence="31">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar • 35 nese thought, all aspects of the one God who is Siwa), while it hides the face of Kala, Siwa's destructive side. This is fitting imagery for the gongstand. From the roots of the cosmic tree which grows in the center of the upper world of the Gods, all life arises and returns continuously through life, birth, death, and rebirth. In their musical func- tion, the gongs are musical icons of that same cosmic process; as the roots of gamelan music, all sounds arise and return to them.19 The Nature and Function of gamelan Music The "three-ness" which informs the structure and design of the plawah and the bronze sounding parts is also inherent in the nature and function of gamelan music. We begin at the most obvious level with anthropomorphism suggested in the three sections of a composition: (1) pengawit (root = kawitan, beginning; i.e. the head), (2) pengawak (root = awak, body) along with pengisep (root = isep, to inhale, another essence), (3) pengecet (root = ngecet, additional) including the penyuwud (root = suwud, end); i.e., the foot, the closing section like the suwukof a gamelan composi- tion in Java. Gamelan music functions in all three levels of the triloka, the macrocosm and the microcosm within it: (1) it is sounded in the middle world by the humans who enjoy it and play it (2) to invite the gods and divine spirits of the upper world who hear the music to descend, and for whom the music serves as the mode of inter-world trans- portation, and (3) to appease the spirits of the lower world who also listen. Moreover, the sound is used for specific rituals for the beings of all three worlds. Gamelan is played for macaru, rituals to placate the evil spirits of the lower world; it is played for rituals of the human world such as weddings; and it is played for temple ceremonies, rituals for the gods and divine spirits in the upper world. Balinese gamelan is one of the examples of instruments or ensembles which simultaneously participate in ritual in both receptive and transitive modes.20 In the context of performance, gamelan is in the receptive mode via the incense, rice, and flower offerings placed at the base of the gongstand that function to</page><page sequence="32">36 • the world of music 33(1) -1991 c# E £ X X X X 2 • « CD « co CD 2 « o S a a¡¡ s C ° O xx xx aa xx xx aa 2 C 2 a O • XT) O ■'J X xxx LÊ a ■g xxx xxxx a" a.j&gt; ā a» 2 ? ^ X ^ a 3 a. a. à o» c c Il 1 H 3 3 C aas I a 33 xxxx a a n n .5 5 2 X X E E e • ..g 3 3 X XX X JC J£ a a JC JC c a Ex xxx a S s a ?

As literally a performed temporal offering, gamelan music operates in the transitive mode; it is an active agent in insuring the efficacy of the rituals in which it is per- formed for the beings of all three Balinese worlds.21 Musical Function and Orchestration We turn our attention here to musical function and orchestration in gamelan. The instruments are divided into five groups by musical function, and the instru- ments belonging to each group are explicated. Gender in gamelan instruments and musical function is then explored. We follow with an interpretation of the musical function of the individual instruments in gamelan performance (orches- tration) as parallel to the social function of individuals in banjar, the neighbor- hood sub-communities in a village which communally own their gamelan. Finally, we explore the relationship between cosmic process and the realization of melody in Balinese gamelan. We especially focus on the cosmic tree and ex- plore the simultaneous realization of a single melody in gamelan music as a musical metaphor for the recreation of the tree. The Musical Function of the Instruments The instruments in a gong kebyar ensemble, like Sekar Anyar, are tuned to a five-tone scale, known as saih lima or salh gong which is derived from a seven- tone pelog system. The instruments can be organized into five groups by their musical functions: (1) leading tempo, rhythm, and dynamic changes, (2) colotomy ; i.e. marking the overall structure of the piece and phrases within it, (3) playing the pokok, the nuclear melody, (4) playing the fully expanded melody based on the pokok, and (5) melodic, rhythmic or melodi-rhythmic ornamentation of the melody. In group one (leading tempo, dynamics and rhythm) are the two kendang(Xhe drums), and the kajar, the one individual gong resting horizontally on its own stand. The two drummers play interlocking rhythmic patterns and, in so doing, control tempo and dynamics; when other instruments provide rhythmic orna- mentation, such as the ceng-ceng (cymbals), their part is related to kendang rhythms. The kajar marks or equally subdivides every pokok beat of a gong kebyar piece and is thus of primary importance as a time-keeper.</page><page sequence="34">38 ■ the world of music 33(1) -1991 Group two (colotomic structure) is comprised of individual hanging gongs: two gong ageng, the kempur, and the kemong. The two gong ageng alternate in marking the beginnings and endings of all pieces, as well as phrases within them which are usually 8, 16, 32, or 64 beats in length; the kempur and kemong punc- tuate or subdivide the phrases. Group three {pokok: nuclear melody) fundamentally consists of the family of three pairs of large single-octave (five bars) metallophones, each pair with its own range, the three pairs in three successive octaves from lowest to highest: jegog, jublag, and panyacah (not found in Sekar Anyar, but used frequently in gong kebyar these days). The individual pairs usually play equirhythmic parts in unison; that is, without syncopation, each note the same in duration as the one before and after it, except (of course) during tempo transitions. The jublag play the pokok per se, the jegog stress the pokok at a 1 :2 or 1 :4 density to the jublag, and the panyacah usually doubles the pokok at a 2:1 density to the jublag. Other kinds of instruments can also sometimes provide a po/co/c function and thus can also be considered as members of group three; however they may do so in a syncopated fashion and at a faster density than the jublag, usually 2:1, sometimes 4:1 . These include the lowest two-octave metallophone, pangugal; the gong chime, trompong; and the pair of gender rambat, the only multi-octave (fourteen bars) metallophones in Sekar Anyar. The trompong and the gender rambat are not always used and rarely together; in fact, gender rambat are pri- marily used only for legong dances (where they replace the pangugal), while trompong is never used for legong.22 Other occasional members of this group are the suling (endblown bamboo flute) and the rebab (two-string bowed spike lute); however, while they can begin a piece as melodic leaders, they soon settle into a role of melodic ornamentation. In group four (playing the melody fully expanded from the pokok) are the family of two-octave (ten bars) metallophones, also with three members in pairs. The lowest member, also the largest in size, is the pangugal (ugal = "to begin," "to lead"), the middle member is pemade (lit. "the one in the middle"), and the highest, also the smallest, is kantilan (either indicating its small size or derived from kanti, "to support" or "to assist"). The three pairs having overlapping ranges with a total range of four octaves; i.e., the tuning of the upper octave of the pan- gugal is the same as that of the lower octave of the pemade etc. Sekar Anyar has one pair of pangugal, and two pairs each of pemade and kantilan. The density of the pangugal melody can vary, although it is frequently half that of the pemade and kantilan, and, as indicated above, it can also serve a poto/f function, belong- ing to group three. The syncopated and interlocking, elaborating technique of</page><page sequence="35">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar • 39 the pairs of pemade and kantilan is called papayasan ("to elaborate," or "elabo- ration"). Each half of a pair interlocks with the other, and all pairs frequently play in unison, usually at a combined density of 8:1 , sometimes 4:1 , of the pokok (jub- lag). The instruments in group five are primarily concerned with ornamentation. This group includes the gong chime, reyong, which provides melodi-rhythmic ornamentation often related to the pemade and kantilan figurations; the ceng- ceng (usually two sets of cymbals, their bottom halves attached to a single base, their upper halves held in the hands of the performer), which provide rhythmic ornamentation; and the bende, a medium-sized hanging gong struck with a wooden mallet, used for rhythmic accent. The reyong and ceng-ceng usually play at 4:1 or 8:1 of the jublag; the bende density varies. As stated above, the slower moving rebab and suling are primarily seen as melodic ornamentors in Bali and thus, perhaps most properly, belong to this group.23 Gender in Balinese gamelan Balinese gamelan incorporate female and male gender associations in their instrumentation and in the musical function of instruments. In all the instruments that are paired, one is male (lanang) and the other female (wadon). This includes the two gong ageng, the two kendang, and, in some parts of Bali, all the pairs of metallophones (gangsa gantung and gender). In these instruments, the one designated as the female of the two is always lower in pitch than the male. On the metallophones, the difference between the slightly lower-pitched tuning of the female {pangumbang, root = kumbang, "bee," "the hummer") and the higher male {"pangisep," "the sipper") (McPhee 1966:30) of a pair are just enough so that when the same bar is played simultaneously on the pair, one hears audible pulsating "beats" between the tunings; these beats account for the "shimmer- ing" quality of Balinese gamelan. The gong lanang and gong wadon are played alternately within a composition to mark the beginning and ending of a piece and all phrases within it. The ken- dang lanang and kendang wadon create a single interlocking rhythmic pattern between them. Of the metallophones, the single-octave jegog, jublag, and pan- yacah (the family with primary responsibility for the pokok), the two-octave pan- gugal, and the multi-octave gender usually play in unison pairs. The two-octave metallophones which expand the pokok ( pemade and kantilan) most frequently play in interlocking, the male and female instruments together creating a single melody; they can also play simultaneously, depending on the type of composi-</page><page sequence="36">40 • the world of music 33(1) - 1991 tion and the composition itself. It does not matter whether it is the female or the male of the pemade and kantilan which plays the on-beat part (polos) or the off- beat part (sangsih), nor are the two parts usually gender associated. As can be noted, what is important is that the female and male instruments together make one melody or otherwise fulfill a single function together. Gender in one more instrument must be discussed here: the reyong, a gong chime with twelve pot-gongs spanning just over two octaves. Although the re- yong is a single instrument, it requires four performers, two for each octave, each octave pair combining together to play a single interlocking melodi-rhythmic ornamentation which is duplicated by the other pair. Gender in reyong perfor- mance techniques may be interpreted as similar to pemade and kantilan ; how- ever, in the case of the reyong; it is, the interlocking parts in each octave of the same instrument which may be viewed as a pair consisting of a lower-pitched female part and a higher-pitched male. In Balinese gamelan, as has been explicated, male and female pairs of instru- ments exist side-by-side, while in their musical functions they are alternating, interlocking, or simultaneous. These shared musical functions are manifesta- tions of Balinese concepts of cosmic, divine and human gender. As we have seen, the cosmic tree of life is simultaneously male and female, each with its own roots, branches, leaves and flowers and its own habits of growing. Dibia (1 989: 1 2) explains that Siwa, the Supreme God whose three aspects are Brahma (creator), Wisnu (preserver) and Siwa (destroyer), is androgynous, or better, Siwa is simultaneously male and female, and each of his male aspects has a female counterpart. Similarly, male and female humans, as fellow human interlocking creators who work alternately or simultaneously in their various roles as support- ers or preservers of life on earth, are fundamentally one in Balinese society, it is these concepts of cosmic, divine and human gender that are symbolized in gamelan. Male and female, as a simultaneous manifestation, exists in all aspects of Balinese culture; thus they are also similarly symbolized as such in other Bali- nese arts including dance, kris (sacred daggers), and dance props (Dibia 1 989).24 Orchestration and Social Structure The orchestration of gamelan can be explored as a musical icon of social structure; i.e., the function of the instruments in performance may be interpreted as parallel to the function of individuals in a banjar, the small hamlets or subcom- munities (in which gamelan are communally owned) within a village, town or city. We begin our investigations by reminding the reader that the names of the three major parts of all the instruments and gamelan compositions are anthropomor-</page><page sequence="37">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar • 41 phic in nature; they can be seen to represent head, body and foot. We turn now to an interpretation of the individual instruments as members of society. The klian is the leader of the banjar. In a gamelan, the female and male ken- dang can be seen as co-musical leaders of the gamelan ; in reality, the klian of the gamelan, is often one of the drummers. However, in a banjar, even the klian bows to the most respected elders to validate all major decisions. In a gamelan, the most respected elders are the male and female gong ageng who begin and end all pieces and all phrases. Other individual gongs, the phrase punctuators, are like individual adult sub-leaders; the adult leaders of the banjarwho rotate in function as heads of committees or leaders of ritual preparations who help make decisions in the community etc. The kajar, which marks every beat, is like the kesinoman who spreads the news throughout the banjar, including newly made decisions. The two families of metallophones, the single-octave family that plays the pokok, and the two-octave family that plays an expanded melody based on the pokok, are like complete families: each with slow moving, low-voiced elders (jegog and pangugal); faster moving middle-voiced adults (jublag and pemade); and high-voiced children, the fastest moving liveliest members of the family (panyacah) or at least ones who make adults keep up with their pace (kantilan). The single-octave pokok metallophones are like a family responsible for rein- forcing the rules of the banjar; the two-octave metallophones are atypical family who follows or lives by the rules. The reyong with its energetic interlocking melo- dic-rhythmic ornamentation played simultaneously in each of its two octaves by two pairs of musicians, is like two teenage couples, either courting following Balinese mores, or playing a team game. The ceng-ceng with their exuberant interlocking rhythmic patterns can also be seen as teenagers. Finally, the trompong, suling, rebab, and bende, in their roles as melodic lead- ers, melodic ornamentors, or for rhythmic accent roles not used in all gamelan compositions - can be seen as individual adults in the community who contrib- ute his or her own special talents whenever they are needed. The male and female gender, who replace pangugal in their occasional use for leading melody, can be seen as elders who do likewise.25 Melodic Realization and the Cosmic Tree A Balinese gamelan composition, like a Javanese, can be thought of as the simultaneous realization of a single melody (Balinese: pokok) by an ensemble of instruments, each with specific functions in that realization. The realization of</page><page sequence="38">42 ■ the world of music 33(1) - 1991 melody in Balinese gamelan music, including its structure, has been explained as an aural Hindu-Buddhist processural mandala (DeVale 1991), a form which Ellingson (1980) refers to as "psychocosmogony;" that is, the spatio-temporal recreation of the self and cosmos through body, voice and mind, with or without outside physical objects or media of support such as sand, dance, music, paint, cloth or wood. We investigate here the relationship between the realization of melody in gamelan and the cosmic tree of life. The tree of life is the primary religio-aesthetic artistic theme on the carving of the instruments of Sekar Anyar. We remind the reader that sekar means both "flower" and "song" and that there is often a metaphorical association between music and botany in the names of gamelan, in the terminology for bronze sound- ing parts, and in musical terminology in general. This metaphorical association has been expressed repeatedly in Hindu literature; for example, in the following two stanzas from the dialogue of Kresna in the "Bhagavad-Gita" {" The Lord's Song") XV, 1 -2 describing the cosmic tree:26 There is a fig tree In ancient story, The giant Açvattha, The everlasting, Rooted in Heaven, Its branches earthward: Each of its leaves Is a song of the Vedas, And he who knows it Knows all the Vedas (spiritual knowledge) Downward and upward Its branches bending Are fed by the 'gunas' (qualities) The buds it puts forth Are the things of the senses, Roots it has also Reaching downward, Into this world, The roots of man's action. We believe the simultaneous realization of melody in Balinese gamelan music by all the instruments can be interpreted as a musical metaphor for the tree, and</page><page sequence="39">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar • 43 si ® c . . 1 13 ¡flslJ üfllJH iflfjj ig~| 2 O ™ «:|f silili! «¿«SH'SSQ'C si! ® c . . 13 ig~| 2 O ™ «¿«SH'SSQ'C |£ .2^ §2 «a, aas§ï# s§ 3§ 3§P«O ff« O-« *'§" §| i C ! § I § O ? m 5-^g-Sg-S «Aggira Ira S wests ff« O-« S i i|3| !

For the purposes of our discussion, we have interpolated the musical functions of the instruments on the Kayonan (cf. Il- lustration 25).27 The male and female gongs (gong ageng) which begin and end all pieces and mark the phrases of the melody, can be seen as the primary male and female roots of the musical tree from which all sounds arise and to which they return. The other individual gongs that punctuate the phrase (kempur and kemong) are like secondary roots. The kajar marks every beat, as if it were delineating each petal of the multi-petaled lotus that grows on the trunk of the tree. The male and female kendang, are like the strongly rhythmic leaves of the lotus. All of the above functions can also be seen as together representing the musical source, support or "foot" of gong kebyar. The nuclear melody is called pokok (lit. "tree trunk") in Bali (as it is in Sunda or west Java). Along the trunk of the tree are all the instruments that do or can pro- vide the pokok : jegog, jublag, panyacah, pangugal, trompong, and gender. The functions of the pokok instruments on its trunk can also be interpreted as to- gether representing the "body" of the musical tree. On the small inner branches of the tree, those nearest the trunk, are those less important instruments which sometimes lead melody or ornament it: suling, rebab, and reyong (the order of their placement from high to low on the tree is purely arbitrary; i.e., by their range). The pemade provide the major branches of the tree; they fill out and thicken the structure of the tree. On the outer branches of the tree, its newest, smallest, and most visible branches, are the high-sound- ing, fast-moving and audibly piercing kantilan, ceng-ceng, and bende. The melodic, rhythmic and melodi-rhythmic figurations performed on all these instru- ments are the flowers (bunga) and leaves (don) that completely and densely fill out the musical branches of the tree. They can also be seen as the "head," of the musical tree. And, finally, in the orchestration of the melodic realization/recreation of the tree, (the musical interaction of the functions of individual instruments), Balinese gamelan, like the tree described in the "Bhagavad-Gita," "reaches into this world, the roots of man's actions" as an icon of social structure and the interac- tion of the functions of male and female humans in society. Summary and Conclusions In the terminology for their parts, both wood and bronze, gamelan instruments incorporate anthropomorphic symbolism of head, body and foot as well as either</page><page sequence="41">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar • 45 III. 25 Gamelan instruments interpolated on the Kayonan by their musical functions in metaphori- cally recreating the cosmic tree (cf. Illustration 13). separate or concurrent botanical symbolism, especially for the heads. In their nine-part morphology, the wood frames, resonator cases and gongstands of a gamelan, together with their bronze sounding parts, have been interpreted as simultaneous symbols of the triangga, triloka, and nawa sanga. Through an analysis of the carving on its instruments, Sekar Anyar has been shown to share its imagery with the Kayonan, the most important and leaf- shaped shadow puppet in wayang. In so doing, the instruments of SekarAnyar, both individually and in their totality, like the Kayonan, are icons of the universe, both macrocosm and microcosm within it. The presence of Bath, the protector/ guardian, indicates that the area enclosed by the instruments of the gamelan is sacred or protected space, like that of the shrines inside the temples in which</page><page sequence="42">46 • the world of music 33(1) - 1991 gamelan is played: temples which are reconstructions of the macrocosm within the microcosm. In their musical function, male and female gamelan instruments reflect con- cepts of gender at cosmic, divine and human levels. The function of individual gamelan instruments has been interpreted as parallel to the function of individu- als, couples and families in the banjaranó the orchestration of gamelan music as an icon of social structure. This seems very appropriate, because it is in the ban- jar of the villages where gamelan functions as essential to the efficacy of rituals performed by humans for the beings of the triloka: the enjoyment of the people themselves, the invitation and mode of transportation for their gods, and the appeasement of evil spirits. The cosmic tree, with its composite male and female elements, grows at the center of the universe; it is that source from which all life arises and to which it all returns. It is very fitting for the tree to be the primary religio-aesthetic theme of the carving on the instruments of a gamelan : its image is on the Kayonan which the dalang uses as a vehicle for the Gods to enter his body during performance, just as gamelan music serves as the vehicle upon which the Gods descend to the middle world and re-ascend to the upper world during ritual. In both cases, the imagery of the tree of life in the upper world provides a most appropriate environ- ment in the middle world to welcome and receive the Gods. As an aural mandala, gamelan music is an icon of the continuous cosmic process of birth, life, death, and rebirth symbolized by the tree. Explored as a metaphor, gamelan music, with its composite male and female elements, can be seen to continuously recreate the tree: the gongs are the roots of the tree; the kajar, its multi-petaled lotus flo- wer, the kendang, its rhythmic lotus leaves, the pokok instruments, its trunk; the melody and rhythm instruments, its large and small branches; and its bronze bars and gongs are its "flowers" and "leaves." The exploration of meaning in Balinese gamelan through Sekar Anyar exempli- fies the theory that in order to more fully understand meaning in musical instru- ment traditions, a study should begin with the simplest physical aspects of the instruments themselves, exploring terminology relating to the construction of their parts, their morphology and their design. The study should then extend the investigation of the cultural concepts uncovered through analysis of the instru- ments themselves into an exploration of orchestration and musical structure. In this way, musical instruments serve as windows to our understanding of culture.

Due to the nature of the cooperation, a word about the authors' backgrounds and training seems to be in order. Sue Carole DeVale is a Western-trained musician, ethnomusicologist and systematic musicologist, on the faculty of the University of California, Los Angeles. She is a specialist in theoretical and conceptual issues in organology which she exemplifies with instruments from African, Asian and Pacific cultures, particularly African harps and the gamelan of Java and Bali. She has taught Javanese gamelan for thirteen years, played Balinese gamelan for four, and has conducted fieldwork in Java and Bali, most recently in Bali from June- September, 1989. 1 Wayan Dibia is a renowned Balinese dancer, choreographer, musician, composer and scholar, and a faculty member at Sekolah Tinggi Seni Indonesia (College of Arts of Indonesia), Denpasar, Bali, where he has also served as Dean of Academic Affairs. He has performed and lectured around the world and published on the arts of Bali, especially dance and dance-drama. We wish to note, however, that he has also received extensive Western training. He holds an M. A. in Dance from UCLA where he is currently completing his dissertation on aria toward a special Independent Ph. D. combining ethnomusicology, dance and theater. 6 We referred particularly to Bandem 1986; J. Becker 1979, 1981 , 1988; A. and J. Becker 1981 ; DeVale 1976, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1984, 1989a, 1989b, 1991; Probohardjono 1984; Sastrapustaka 1984; and Vetter 1986:32-6, 130-3. 7 These three loka have also been explained as parallel to "heaven, sky, earth" (Hooykaas 1966:66, 68), and "atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere" (Budihardjo 1986:33). 8 Cf. Budihardjo 1 986 for additional information about the ways in which the triangga governs Balinese archi- tecture. 9 We gratefully acknowledge Donn Allen Carter for rendering all the figures for this paper, all but one of them on computer. 10 Cf. Budihardjo (1986) for further explanation of the application of sanga mandala/nawa sanga in Balinese architecture. 11 For a more complete explication of these three concepts as indicators of the relationship between architec- ture and gamelan instrument design, cf. DeVale 1 991 . 12 All photographs in this paper were taken by Sue Carole DeVale. 13 In some other types of Balinese gamelan, there is an additional kind of bar which is flat on the bottom and rounded on the top, like a more or less flattened "D" lying on its straight side. The instruments they belong to are called saron or gangsa jongkok (lit. "resting bronze"); i.e., the bars are fastened with nails and rest on the surface of either a trough resonator or a case with individual resonators, either of which is usually carved from the solid. Saron, with similar kinds of resonators, are also found in Javanese and Sundanese gamelan. 14 It is also quite possible that the painting and gilding of Balinese gamelan also informs meaning and that sym- bolism lies in the choice of colors used to paint them. While these days there is a trend toward elaborate carv- ing and coloration, many gamelan constructed in the 1950s and before, were left unpainted, some even uncarved. Since Sekar Anyar is carved but not painted, an exploration of color symbolism in Balinese game- lan will be dealt with in a future article. 1 5 The design of the Cirebonese gamelan at the Field Museum (accessioned 1 893) in Chicago has been found to incorporate, in its totality, the imagery of the parallel Javanese shadow puppet called kayon or gunungan (DeVale 1977:132-47). 1 6 A note here about the terminology for design elements: they sometimes take a special linguistic form in which the root word is repeated, and the nominalizing suffix -an added, to indicate "imitation of" or "representation of;" thus kakul-kakulan, for example, means imitation or representation of snails. 1 7 The function of the central panel on gong chime frames is to act as a cover for the lower bodies and feet of the performers; i.e., so the audience instead sees a beautiful piece of wood: carved, painted or not. Whether or not the central panel actually touches the ground does not matter; those on the gong chimes of Sekar Anyar come to within an inch of touching the floor and thus provide the usual body coverage. 1 8 Sae is most probably derived from the Chinese word "shi, " meaning "lion."</page><page sequence="45">DeVale/Dibia, SekarAnyar • 49 19 Cf. Table 1 for a summary of the location of individual designs on the instruments of Sekar Anyar. 20 In the receptive mode, the instrument itself is the subject of a ritual which may take place in any of twelve posited stages in its "life cycle" from before construction to after its last use; in the transitive mode, the instru- ment is essential to the efficacy of a ritual for a person, place or thing other than the instrument itself. Cf. DeVale 1988 for further explication of the receptive and transitive modes including examples from African, Asian and Pacific cultures. Dibia (1 990) found these modes to be equally applicable as the conceptual frame- work for his investigation of rituals practiced in Balinese theater. 21 Cf. Harnish 1 991 for further explication of gamelan music and other performing arts as offerings. 22 Gender rambat are not usual instruments for a gong kebyar. They properly belong to gamelan pelegongan (for legong). Conversely, trompong, are not included in a gamelan pelegongan. Mantle Hood had the gender and trompong specially made for Sekar Anyar so that UCLA's set of Balinese gamelan instruments could be used as either ensemble, thereby increasing the possible repertoire for both teaching and performance. For similar reasons, he had additional instruments made to add to Kyai Mendung, UCLA's primary Javanese gamelan. 23 For more specific information on the function of individual instruments, cf. Dibia 1978. For more information including transcriptions in Western notation, cf. McPhee 1966: passim. 24 The alternation of male and female characteristics and mannerisms in movement can be seen as forms of androgyny in Balinese dance, especially those which are considered the dances of puberty: legong for fe- males, and baris for males. Dibia (1 989:1 3) further explains "the main types of dance in Balinese tradition, igei mwani (male dance) and igei eluh (female dance), are identified not based on the sexual types of the perform- ers, but rather, on a set of symbols and codification embodied within the various aspects of the dance." 25 Cf. Table 2 for a summary of the instruments in a gong kebyar, their number, type, gender, musical and social functions. 26 Translated in Moebirman 1960:24. 27 In so doing, however, we do not intend to indicate the exact number of instruments in a gamelan ; rather, we placed the instruments in symmetrical arrangement to mirror the symmetry of the Kayonan. For example, al- though there are two jegogeXc., only one is listed on the trunk; conversely, there is only one rebab or reyong in a gong kebyar ; but, for the sake of symmetry, we labeled branches with their names on either side of the trunk (cf. Illustration 25). References Bandem, I Made 1 986 Prakempa: sebuah Lontar Gambelan Bali. Denpasar : Akademi Seni Tari Indonesia.
