      <p>On a Saturday afternoon Sue and Arthur Snyder drive two hours north from their suburban home with their three‐year‐old son and six‐year‐old daughter to visit the National Western Stock Show and Rodeo. Sue grew up on a farm in South Dakota, but this is her first time here. It was Arthur’s idea to bring the kids to see the animals, she tells me, adding that she especially likes seeing all the products for sale and the exhibits. They both say it is important to expose their kids to the western style of life. As Sue explains, “Animals are special. I think all kids love animals—it’s a natural affinity they have. I think it’s good to expose them and teach them how to treat them and to respect them.”</p>
      <p>The American West enjoys tremendous currency in the United States and abroad, as illustrated in this vignette. As an imagined, but very real site in our national cultural memory (Anderson 1983; Dorst 1999), the American West conveys powerful meanings in a range of consumer products and activities (Arnould, Price, and Tierney 1998; Belk and Costa 1998; Goetzmann and Goetzmann 1986). As examples of its international appeal, the popular Fritz Walter’s Old Texas Town in Berlin features an Alamo memorial and a rock dedicated to John Wayne (Fesperman 1994), while rodeos are popular in Brazil, with lucrative prizes that draw U.S. professional rodeo cowboys (Brooke 1995).</p>
      <p>Central to this trade show is promoting the beef industry, yet its animal performances and exhibit booths appeal to consumers as entertainment. In this research, I examine consumers’ entertainment activities and interactions with other people and animals as a form of cultural production. Preliminary field work showed consumers actively engaged with western culture—cognitively and experientially learning its history and acting out cultural elements of language, dress, and customs, as they tour the animal pens, shows, and sales; browse through merchandise booths; and enjoy the trained animal performances. Historical references are widespread, raising questions regarding their use by consumers in producing cultural memory. Finally, because it is a trade show, I address questions regarding how consumers relate to the beef industry.</p>
      <p>I begin by theoretically framing the study, bringing together historical work on the American West with cultural aspects of consumer behavior. The ethnographic account draws from participant observation, depth interviews, and photographic and material artifact analyses in demonstrating consumers’ cultural production processes. Consumers negotiate cultural meanings and memories regarding competition, naturalism, freedom/independence, and family tradition at four levels. First, consumer behavior entails a blend of entertainment, education, and business activity. Consumers stroll through the site, spectate and participate in various elements of the show, interact with others, learn about the nation’s western heritage, and role‐play, hence, the subtitle of this article, animating cultural meaning and memory. Second, consumers’ urban or rural residence and experience with animals and with western cultural products, including films and novels, influences their meaning‐making processes. Third, consumers interact with many others, primarily ranchers, in making distinctions between urban and rural ways of life. Finally, consumers interact with beef producers and marketers in generating entertaining, educational, and commercial experiences related to the beef industry.</p>
      <p>The implications emphasize the active, yet constrained, nature of consumers’ cultural production. Consumers produce cultural meanings and memories as they experience the show and, in doing so, grant cultural legitimacy to the beef industry, although industry practices heavily influence their behavior here. Second, this research shows how consumers’ cultural production processes mediate their experience with market agents, offerings, and the material marketplace. Such production is much more than associations; consumers constitute their very understandings of the market in and through the meanings and memories they produce in relation to its agents and offerings. Finally, this research explores issues in consuming another culture. Most consumers are not members of the culture that they consume here. Many lack ranch experience, while others no longer live on a ranch, raising particular research challenges and suggestions for further research.</p>

            <p>Delineating the western region of the United States and reviewing its cultural impact is important in building the theoretical framework for this work. In writing about the western United States, I refer to the region and corresponding ways of life west of the Mississippi River (Riebsame 1997).1 The West functions as a regional subculture (Costa and Bamossey 1995) and imagined community (Anderson 1983; Dorst 1999) that is shaped by a history of business activity with an impact on social relations and the natural environment. In turn, each of these areas offers promising theoretical exposition in making sense of consumers’ behaviors at this show.</p>

               <title>The Importance of Historical Framing.</title>
               <p>All cultures have creation myths; they are important for cultural members in working through complex realities (Fernandez 1986; Lévi‐Strauss 1969). Historian Patricia Nelson Limerick (1987) credits the creation myth of the American West in explaining its currency and its resilience in resisting fact and experience. Writes fellow historian Dayton Duncan,<disp-quote>
                     <p>From its beginning, the story of the West has in great part been the story of different people seeing whatever it was they wanted to see there, often to the exclusion of harder truths and messier realities. … Some have looked at the majestic landscape and seen objects of reverence and worship; some have seen a warehouse with stockpiles of treasure available on a first‐come, first served basis. People have seen the West as the place to lose themselves, or find themselves; to save others’ souls, and sometimes risk their own; to get rich, get lucky, or get away; to chase adventure and court danger; to be brave and free or left alone. (1996, p. 427)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
               </p>
               <p>Over a relatively short history, the U.S. West has become a utopian sanctuary of freedom, abundance, and opportunity. In many ways the region represents all the promises of capitalism with few externalities: free land for homesteaders; freedom from the social constraints of eastern cities; rags‐to‐riches wealth in gold and minerals from the 1840s into the early twentieth century; and an increased standard of living from industrial, service, and high‐tech jobs, and from glimmering celebrity careers, from the mid‐1900s to the present (Limerick 1987; Slotkin 1985; Ward 1996). To this day, the legacy of this myth remains in understandings of our political‐economic system; particularly noteworthy are conflations of capitalism with democracy, and personal liberty with economic freedom.</p>
               <p>Unraveling fact from myth has proven to be a formidable challenge for western historians. Over the past several decades they have critiqued heroic accounts of exploring virgin territory, battling hostile Native Americans and Mexicans, and discovering gold and silver, highlighting omissions of daily life and the experiences of those not male or white (Harris 1987; Limerick 1987). More recent historical work brings forward the significance of Native Americans (Churchill 1993; Deloria 1998), Latinos/Latinas (Acuña 1988; Poyo and Hinojosa 1991), African Americans (Broussard 1993; Flamming 1999), Asians (Chen 1980; Matsumoto 1999), and women (Johnson 1999; Scharff 1999) in the U.S. West.</p>
               <p>Particularly resilient is Turner’s (1893) frontier thesis, which attributes the uniqueness of American civilization to the taming of the West. In a series of forceful challenges, Limerick (1987), Limerick, Milner, and Rankin (1991), and White and Limerick (1994) note profound historical continuities: the denial of unbridled aggression in killing people and taking their land, which is masked as victimization; the denial of widespread dependence on the federal government in capitalizing supposedly independent business accomplishments, such as building the railroads, fighting Native Americans, constructing massive irrigation systems for growing crops and raising cattle, and assembling vast networks of roads essential for the transportation of products, minerals, and timber; the denial of the interdependence of politics and business, as many western politicians were businesspeople who benefited from enacted legislation; and the denial of the widespread diversity of western inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Coming to grips with these continuities is a valuable lesson in American history. Omissions of the centrality of business activity leave in their wake distorted understandings of national culture, and a profoundly mystified sense of our economic system. Yet there is an additional sense in which this historical work is relevant; it is invaluable to consumer researchers in exploring how consumers use history in reproducing cultural meanings regarding their heritage and what is important to them as a people. This consumption of history is distinct from previous studies employing history as a research method (Savitt 1980) that tracks changes in marketing thought (Fullerton 1988) and consumer behavior (Witkowski 1989). At the stock show, many events and activities are linked to the romanticized western past. Consumers' use of popular western cultural products and performances featuring historical references to the Old West raises important questions regarding their roles and those of marketers in blurring lines between fact and fiction, and between the imaginary and the real in cultural production.</p>

               <title>Fundamentally a Business Enterprise.</title>
               <p>Most relevant for our purposes is historians’ increasing attention to the importance of business activity in the West. In challenging th West's creation myth, historians replace popular notions of individual miners, lonesome cowboys, and hearty pioneers spreading their ideals and ways of life over empty land with well‐documented accounts of business transactions. This work brings a new level of understanding by highlighting interrelationships between whites and Native Americans as well as conflicts (Smith 1987; Van Kirk 1987), the losses as well as the gains of individual and corporate mineral and land speculators (Morrissey 1997; Skaggs 1986), and pervasive politics (Limerick 1987; Slotkin 1985; Ward 1996).</p>
               <p>The market incentives of free land and minerals fueled western expansion, although often speculators benefited from individual miners and family homesteaders (González 1987). Early evidence of the global economy is pervasive, as many land, cattle, and mineral speculators came in the 1800s from foreign countries such as England and Scotland, as well as the eastern United States (Limerick 1987; Skaggs 1986). Regarding minerals, surface prospecting did benefit some, but it was short‐lived; more often the beneficiaries were traders charging outrageous prices for basic necessities (Ward 1996). Ultimately, most gold and silver profits accrued to large corporations dependent on thousands of low‐paid wage workers, and the investments of easterners who unknowingly paid several times over the worth of many mines (Limerick 1987).</p>
               <p>Attention to business by western historians is a welcome step. Yet for the most part, their emphasis has been on production, and successful production at that. Yet for every celebrated rancher and railroad baron stood thousands of small farmers, ranch hands, waitresses, mine employees, and prostitutes, and incorporating them into western history is integral in forming a more complete understanding of our economic system.</p>
               <p>While widespread, the experiences of unsuccessful settlers and miners is only beginning to gain historians’ attention. Emblazoned by their beliefs in the divine sanction of their presence on western lands, settlers fought desperately against drought, insects, weeds, and Native American raids to grow poorly adapted crops. Regarding mining, rags‐to‐riches stories attracted tens of thousands of Asians, South Americans, and Europeans (Ward 1996), despite the hard, monotonous, and often unrewarding work of digging, stooping, and bending in cold water (Limerick 1987). Firsthand accounts of hardship by pioneers, settlers, and miners led Limerick to conclude that western expansion was a lot of work: “Only a few Americans utterly lost in myth and symbol could have imagined that life in the West was labor‐free” (1987 p. 97). Yet while production is important, consumption commands an equally important role in righting the historical record.</p>

            <sec id="sc1.1.3">
               <title>Consumption as an Overlooked Motive for Western Expansion.</title>
               <p>The prospect of a better life lies at the core of western history and myth, although neither is recognized as a consumption epic. Yet, without this dream neither historical accounts of western development nor their mythic variations are intelligible. Central to historical accounts of the U.S. West is the consumer dream of attaining material abundance and personal freedom; in less glossy terms, the dream entails the steadfast desire to make a quick buck and an obsession with the good life (Limerick 1987). This is where the myth stops and recent historical work takes up relating widespread experience to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Fundamental to the lifestyles of early ranchers and settlers was subsistence agriculture, a way of life based primarily on home production, with limited consumption of products from the local mercantiles, traveling merchants, or fairs. Women’s work consisted of cooking; canning meat, fruit, and vegetables; sewing; washing; child care; gardening; and, depending on class, caring for animals and taking on boarders (Harris 1987). Because of less‐rigidly defined gender roles on farms and ranches, as well as the importance of women in bolstering population numbers for statehood, women enjoyed relative autonomy in the Old West as compared with women in the eastern United States (Roach 1990; Stefanco 1987).2 Further, because the population ratio was many more men than women, it was not uncommon for men to take on women's work (Johnson 1999). Add this to the effort and cost of the journey west, an estimated $1,500 alone to supply a wagon (Jameson 1987), and it appears that the move entailed a step down in social mobility for many.</p>
               <p>Nor was mining an inexpensive venture. Passage from the eastern United States and other nations cost several hundred dollars, with several hundred more in supplies. At $1 a pound for potatoes, 50¢ an egg, $20 for a bottle of rum, and $2 to receive a letter (Ward 1996, p. 146), expenses added up quickly. To pay their debts and earn passage home, many miners took jobs they never would have had back East, digging in the deep underground shafts of large mining corporations (Limerick 1987).</p>

                     <p>Women first gained the right to vote in Wyoming, followed by Colorado. Historians cite several factors: the need for more people to satisfy federal requirements for statehood, a less rigid gender‐based division of labor on homesteads, and women’s suffrage organizations (Harris 1987; Stefanco 1987).</p>

               <title>Consumption as a Blur of Fantasy and Reality.</title>
               <p>Consumption of the Old West literally in land and minerals, and figuratively in popular cultural products, is important in fueling the blend of fantasy and reality that remains today. A prime example is Buffalo Bill’s Wild West. At the turn of the century consumers in cities across the United States and Europe flocked to see reenactments of Bill Cody killing buffalo and battling Native Americans and Mexicans. Actual Native American and Mexican people and exotic live animals gave further authenticity to the large traveling productions sponsored by the <italic>Denver Post</italic> newspaper.3 Today, the accuracy of representations of Buffalo Bill are routinely challenged by historians (Slotkin 1993; White 1994); nevertheless, he remains a celebrated hero in museums across the West.</p>
               <p>Hostile Native Americans and Mexicans doing violence to white settlers abound in early western film and novels (Goetzmann and Goetzmann 1986; Slotkin 1973), although a minority of Native American (Churchill 1992) and Mexican (Acuña 1988) people were violent. Historians credit the popularity of these products among European settlers and their beliefs in “manifest destiny” (i.e., that the western United States was promised to them by God) in providing moral justification for taking lives and land (Limerick 1987; Peña 1998).</p>
               <p>Blurs between fact and fiction in the Old West are confounded by marketing activity as well. Wrobel (1999) documents the <italic>speils</italic> of land developers in the late 1800s and early 1900s in promoting frontier land as already settled. Some went so far as to alter the climate, claiming that the coming of the railroad and increased farming activity had turned the arid plains then known as the Great American Desert into fertile lands (Ward 1996, p. 265). While it is hard to fathom now that people then could have believed the outrageous claims, they were supported by unusual amounts of rainfall in the 1870s and 1880s. Hard times and years later, thousands gave up lands claimed under the Homestead Act of 1862, unable to reside on such dry land the required seven months a year (Limerick 1987).</p>
               <p>Despite ample historical and contemporary evidence to the contrary, the potency of the “American dream” continues, although somewhat transposed to include immigrants (Peñaloza 1994) and emigrants (Dodds 2000). As Duncan notes, “An important part of the reality of the West is the dream—or more accurately, the dreams—of the West. Its history can only be understood with that in mind. And the same is true of the present. Separating myth and dream from reality is as impossible now as ever. They are distinguishable, but inseparable” (1996, p. 427).</p>
               <p>Now as then, the impact of the West goes well beyond those who live it. Western images and themes in art, books, and performances have had a tremendous impact in building the western imaginary for westerners and nonwesterners (Belk and Costa 1998; Goetzmann and Goetzmann 1986; Slotkin 1973, 1992; Tompkins 1992). The gaps and overlaps between historical accounts, representations in popular cultural products, and popular understandings of the West comprise a fertile ground for consumer researchers interested in cultural production in the contemporary marketplace.</p>

            <title>Consuming the Trade Show</title>
            <p>In studying consumer behavior at this stock show, it is important to retain its status as a trade show. Whereas previous work emphasizes sales and business‐to‐business interactions, I direct attention to its cultural functioning. In terms of scope, trade show expenditures are second only to advertising in most marketing communications budgets, with annual expenditures of over $53 billion in the United States alone (Gopalakrishna et al. 1995). Among the largest in attendance are the COMDEX Computer Exposition and the International Housewares Exhibition (Webster 1994).</p>
            <sec id="sc1.2.1">
               <title>Behavioral Orientation.</title>
               <p>Because consumers come here as a leisure activity, one key is analyzing the dynamics of their entertainment (Project on Disney 1995). In this research I approach cultural meaning‐making as something that consumers do that informs, and is the result of, their behavior at the show (De Certeau 1984). Particularly salient are the activities and narratives through which consumers construct a fun experience at this trade show, which combines beef marketing, education on cattle production, and spectacular animal performances reenacting the Old West. As important is examining how consumers position themselves within this market space vis‐à‐vis their actual interactions with other people and with imagined notions of the West.</p>
               <p>Several researchers have argued that performance is central to many consumption behaviors (Deighton 1992; Sherry 1998). Yet further empirical work remains to be done regarding the specific processes and outcomes of consumers' market performances. In this work I use the term “animate” to refer to the ways that consumers give life to cultural meanings and memories. The term denotes movement and illusion as well, in the contrasts of myth and reality in references to western history and present circumstances, that consumers invoke and enact in consuming the West at this show.</p>
               <p>Further, while spectacular consumer behavior is most often depicted apart from daily consumer behavior in the literature, at the show these two domains are brought together in ways that merit theorization. Previous work describes cultural production either in daily consumption practices and rituals, such as grooming, possession, product use, and disposession (Belk 1988; McCracken 1988; Rook 1985; Tani and Rathje 1995); or in spectacular consumption sites and experiences, such as expositions (Rydell 1993), festivals (Lavenda 1992; Prosterman 1995), and theme parks (Davis 1997; O’Guinn and Belk 1989). In contrast, this show employs western spectacles at the rodeo and animal performances, even as much show activity entails the promotion of a product, beef, that is consumed daily. Thus, in this work I explore the possibility that the cultural meanings consumers produce in show spectacles are the means through which they constitute their understandings of the day‐to‐day functioning of the market.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="sc1.2.2">
               <title>A Relational Approach.</title>
               <p>The show is not an autonomous cultural domain but, rather, a physical marketplace site characterized by particular social and historical relations (Frenzen and Davis 1990; Sack 1992). When taking a relational approach to cultural meaning‐making, it is important to investigate the mix of people at the show and how consumers interact with them (Sherry 1990). Like other consumer subcultures, the western consumer subculture consists of a regional way of life that is manifest in and outside of the marketplace in the activities, language, foods, music, and dress of a group of people, and in their relations with others (Costa and Bamossey 1995). Of particular interest here are relations between meat consumers (“visitors”) and meat producers (“ranchers”), as well as distinctions in race, ethnicity, and gender.</p>
               <p>In coming to the stock show, consumers cross a contemporary manifestation of the western frontier in the contrasts between their way of life and that of rural ranchers. Here consumers enthusiastically confront beef producers, their animals, and the western way of life. Important distinctions are found in how the two groups think about their lifestyles, particularly in relation to food production, given that the focus of this show is on cattle. As the result of industrialism and urbanism, most U.S. consumers have little or no experience producing food. Contributing further to their separation from food production, marketing technologies of cutting, packaging, and labeling leave meat products virtually unrecognizable as a previously living being (Robbins 1987).</p>
               <p>Significantly, consumers’ interactions with producers at the trade show have not been touched on in the consumer socialization literature, which instead focuses on consumers’ purposeful, direct learning, as it is influenced by parents, and more subtle, indirect learning, as it is influenced by peers, schools, the media, and retail businesses (Moschis 1987; Peñaloza and Gilly 1999; Shrum, Wire, and O’Guinn 1998). In focusing on the trade show as a site of consumer socialization, this article adds to emerging work investigating the ways that producers provide consumers with substantive cultural meanings and values (Peñaloza 2000), as well as products and services.</p>

            <sec id="sc1.2.3">
               <title>Cultural Meaning and Memory.</title>
               <p>Importantly, the cultural meanings that consumers express at the show are not just contemporary but extend back to the past by comparing contemporary life with that in the Old West. Themes of development and modernization are particularly acute (Lears 1981; Limerick 1987). As of 1900, roughly two‐thirds of the U.S. population lived in rural areas, compared with less than one‐fourth today (Russell 1993). Settlements of wealthy urbanites and suburbanites seeking the space, tranquility, and community of rural life currently are transforming the West, raising real estate prices well beyond the reach of most farmers and ranchers (Berry 1977; Cohen 1998). Yet, while the rural lifestyle remains viable only for a small segment of the population, its appeal for consumers in coming to the show may be to experience cultural meanings considered lost in urban life, such as being closer to animals and living more naturally.</p>
               <p>Consumers’ relations with animals at the stock show provide an excellent setting for exploring contrasts between the Old and New West. A vital part of western myth and history relates to the natural abundance of animals, intense encounters with wild creatures, and imaginative accounts of taming them for sustenance and entertainment (Wilson 1992). Prolific deer, buffalo, and feral cattle and hogs sustained popular notions of the West as a living cornucopia (Skaggs 1986; Ward 1996). Yet here consumers pay to see domestic animals meticulously groomed, shown, and performing imitations of human behavior as the result of rigorous regimes of animal husbandry and training.</p>
               <p>Previous work on the consumption of animals focuses on pets (Hirschman 1994), yet no less significant are consumers’ relations to the animals routinely used for food (Arluke and Sanders 1996; Douglas 1966; Leach 1982). Consumers’ amusement in viewing the animals possibly reflects a celebration of humans’ triumph over nature (Ritvo 1987), as well as some anxiety and humor in defusing uncomfortable truths regarding eating animals (Freud 1905 [1960]; Leach 1982) and their own perceived disassociation from nature (Davis 1997; Wilson 1992). In relating to animals here, consumers may invoke a conflation of cultural meanings. Consumers may claim their role as beef consumers and acknowledge the work of ranchers in producing beef for them. Alternatively, consumers may deflect these roles, instead relating to the animals as pets, identifying with the ranchers as Old West cowboys or exhibiting combinations of these meanings and memories.</p>
               <p>Finally, race, ethnic, and gender relations in the Old West are especially challenging in their juxtaposition of civilizing impulses with the violence and domination of conquest. The West is experienced in different ways by whites and nonwhites, each with a mixed legacy. For whites, popular depictions of adventurous explorers, miners, and ranchers accompany those of land thieves, murderers, and forced religious converters. For Native Americans, popular depictions of hostile savages stand beside romantic naturalists and spiritualists, wealthy casino owners, and movement activists fighting ongoing battles for land, mineral, and water rights (Churchill 1992). For Latinos, representations of ruthless conquerors accompany hardworking immigrants and sexy lovers (Rodríguez 1998). African Americans and Asians most often are missing in depictions of the West, although thousands of Asians came to work in the mines and railroads and thousands of African Americans came seeking freedom during the antebellum years. The contributions of Asian workers and business owners and those of African‐American Buffalo Soldiers and cowboys are emerging in revisionist history (Broussard 1993; Matsumoto 1999). For women, the greater autonomy of the Old West more often translates to rural gender roles more traditional than those of their urban counterparts (Prosterman 1995). Of interest is the blend of historical and contemporary race, ethnic, and gender relations that consumers express at the show, thereby producing western culture.</p>

            <p>The National Western Stock Show began in l899 as a livestock market organized by livestock merchants, stockyard executives, meat packers, and cattlemen (Simms 1981). From the start they attracted the public with baby contests and “rough riding” animals. Over time events have been added and dropped based on industry and public concerns. As examples, horse shows were added in 1907, and bull riding was dropped in 1912 for being inhumane, only to be resumed in 1931 to highlight the rodeo (Simms 1981).</p>
            <p>By 1906 the show gained billing as second only to the Great International Exhibition in Chicago. Important to its growth was the development of the local beef industry (Skaggs 1986) and the financial support of local businesses and media. The Burlington train ran discounted rates on long‐distance routes, and local businesses offered show specials. The <italic>Denver Post</italic> listed notable attendees in its society pages—East Coast beef barons in bowler hats and topcoats, ranchers from Mexico in sombreros, city dignitaries, and prominent businessmen (Simms 1981).</p>
            <p>Today the appeal of the show continues in its portrayal of ranch life, business activity, and the excitement of the rodeo. Over the past 100 years, its mix of cattle business and entertainment has been boosted by ardent merchandizing—buying and selling everything from cattle, semen, and feed to western clothing and art to household appliances. In 2000, 631,800 people attended the show, and there was a rodeo purse of $520,000. The show's annual stimulation to the local economy is estimated at $7 million in livestock sales, with another $55 million in sales of various products and services (Smith 1997).</p>

            <p>The data set consists of field notes from 210 hours of participant observation, verbatim transcriptions of 88 interviews, and collections of hundreds of photographs and material artifacts. Interviewees were selected to represent the range of participants and perspectives at the event. Informants include 29 consumers, 29 ranchers, and 30 exhibitors, although this article focuses on consumers.4 While there is some overlap, as some consumers and booth exhibitors also operate ranches, all are classified according to their primary show activity. I use the terms “consumer” and “visitor” synonymously, and “ranch” and “nonranch” consumer to distinguish those with and without ranch experience. Informants vary with regard to gender, age, occupation, rural/urban residence, and type and level of involvement with stock animals (see table 1). Informants answered questions on their reasons for coming to the show, their activities, their perspectives regarding what goes on here, their beef consumption, and selected sociodemographic characteristics.<table-wrap id="tb1" position="float" seq="1">

            <p>In addition to the transcribed interviews, I logged participant observation at 21 cattle sales, 20 cattle shows, 14 visits to Children’s Ranchland, 13 rodeos, over 200 exhibit booths, and 20 entertainment performances, including wagon competitions, horse and dog pulls, riding contests, and cow and sheep cutting contests. Artifacts analyzed include over 300 brochures, business cards, and trade publications, in addition to a large file of general interest newspaper coverage. Completing the data set are 550 photographs of participants, events, and merchandise booths.</p>
            <p>The analysis began after the first year with summaries of findings organized by type of data—interviews, field notes, artifacts, and photographs. I then derived preliminary categories based on patterns in the data. Categories were formed for types of agents (visitors, ranchers, and booth exhibitors), events (rodeo, booths, sales, and shows), and consumer behaviors (spectating, petting the animals). In subsequent years, as I gained familiarity with show elements and noted repetition in informants’ responses, I shifted attention to generating and evaluating themes and cultural principles. I derived themes from the substantive content of the data across the categories (freedom, nature, competition, etc.). I derived cultural principles from an analysis of relationships among themes and across participants and events. Evaluation methods included triangulation across data categories (agents, events/activities, and booths) and data sources (interviews, participant observation, and artifact and photograph analysis), with particular attention to contrasts in what consumers said the show meant to them and their activities.</p>
            <p>In addition, as part of the iterative nature of the analysis, I asked subsequent interviewees to comment on the emergent categories and themes. This procedure approximates a dialogue between the researcher and those interviewed, potentially achieving a richer understanding of the phenomena, as points of conversion, diversion, and contradiction are investigated further (Fontana and Frey 1994). Finally, I sought outliers and counterevidence. For example, visitors expressed the theme of competition even as they gave evidence of cooperation among ranchers. In reexamining the data on each of the themes with attention to the research objectives, I was able to generate insight as to how consumers’ behavior and interactions with various agents and with imaginary and real show events come into play in their cultural production.</p>

            <title>Researcher Subjectivity</title>
            <p>Because the ethnographer is the primary data collector and analyzer, I will provide a few comments regarding my experience with the West. I grew up as a Mexican‐American in a small, predominantly white town in central Texas, in a suburban area surrounded by farms. An annual highlight in our community was the Heart of Texas Fair and Rodeo. My earliest memories of the West are being scolded at school for giving my family’s version of the battle of the Alamo. While I did not grow up on a ranch or farm, I went to school with those who did (commonly and fondly referred to as “pig farmers” and “shit kickers”) and have had a fascination with western culture ever since.</p>
            <p>Though I have seen economic growth and recession, and appreciate good times, my penchant for open land squares me well within the western imaginary. Regarding beef consumption, I have moved from being a regular meat‐eater to eating chicken, grains, and vegetables to being a strict vegetarian and then back to eating all of the above in moderation. I now eat meat infrequently, although I find that plate of barbecue or chicken fried steak tough to resist, especially when visiting family in Texas, where, to this day, a meal is not considered a meal without meat. This research began with the question of how the West is consumed. Addressing it has led me to explore how consumer entertainment is historically situated, with cultural and economic traditions that affect our quality of life and sustainable ecology.</p>
            <p>The ethnographic account is best described as impressionistic, as it combines interviews and photographs with researcher observation and analysis (Van Maanen 1984). The purpose for this writing style is to bring readers to the field site, as the means of communicating the findings. My account begins with an overview of the show and proceeds through its major elements in the order of visitors’ priorities, with descriptions of show events interwoven with photographs, consumer testimony, and interpretive analysis. The account closes with consumers’ assessments of the show.</p>

            <title>Overview</title>
            <p>The stock show is held on a large plot of land northeast and downwind from downtown Denver. The facilities include a coliseum, stadium, exhibition hall, horse events center, several livestock arenas, scores of indoor and outdoor animal pens, and a dozen parking lots. The old Stock Exchange Building and a water tower with a fading emblem of Cudahy Bar S Meats are what remain of the huge slaughtering operations that peaked here in the mid‐1900s and have long since relocated. Today, the show grounds are surrounded by specialty packing houses, a cemetery where some of Denver’s finest were buried at the turn of the century, trucking operations, a Purina Dog Chow factory, a few topless bars, low‐income houses, and a Latino cultural center.</p>
            <p>Most visitors arrive at the Education Hall on complimentary bus rides from the remote parking lots. The first thing noticeable is the musty smell of animals. Typically, visitors walk through the exhibit booths and up to Ranchland. From there they go through the animal pens and out to the stockyards, with brief stops at a show or sale, and then to the rodeo. Others go directly to the rodeo or entertainment events held in the stadium, such as the dog pull and horse hitch competitions. I note these traffic patterns in informants’ reports of their activities and my observations. There are variations depending on the weather and the amount of time consumers spend here. “Stock show” weather refers to freezing temperatures and snow, although clear, sunny skies are just as common. While most consumers come to the show for a few hours, some spend most of a day.</p>

            <title>Consumers</title>
            <p>My informants are a varied group—16 women and 13 men, seven in couples and 15 as individuals (table 1). Ages range from 20 to 72 years, with an average of 44.6 years. Most informants are here with family and/or friends; only Hispanic Alejandro Nuñez is here alone. Of the 10 visitors with children, three bring their young children, three bring their teenagers, one brings her nephew, and two bring their grandchildren. Occupations include teachers, ranchers, nurses, delivery persons, students, housewives, a firefighter, an engineer, an advertiser, a retired lawyer, and a business manager. They come from nine U.S. states. Of the 17 Coloradans, seven are from Denver and 10 are from small towns. Regarding race, 26 visitors are white, one is Hispanic, one is Native American, and one is African American, which approximates the racial composition here. I observe very few African‐American visitors; one works as a rodeo bullfighter, and another shines shoes in the booth area. Latinos/Latinas are slightly more prevalent, especially at the Charro Extravaganza, a special event added in 1995 featuring Mexican vaqueros (cowboys), a Mariachi band, and an emcee speaking Spanish and English.</p>
            <p>Informants give multiple reasons for coming to the show. By far the most common is to see the animals. Of the 16 visitors with this purpose, 10 single out the cattle and bulls, four mention the horses, and two highlight the youth showing their cattle. The rodeo is next in popularity, with seven visitors, while six come expressly to see the product booths and exhibits. Five visitors have come for their children to experience the show. The remaining responses include entertainment (4), learning about the industry (3), people watching (1), as a vacation (1), and the show is a “must see in Denver” (1). “I love these $67 family outings,” jokes visitor Alan Banks, counting the money he as spent so far, “$32 to get in, $25 for lunch, $5 to park, and still counting!” Alan has come to the show with his wife, Heather, and sons Jeff and Cody, four and eight years old, to see the animals. Cody says he especially likes the bulls. Heather says the booths “make the show” for her.</p>
            <p>Typically, visitors come to the show as a leisure outing. Many children and adults don western wear—jeans, denim shirts, boots, a hat, and a bandana, while others purchase them here. Some of the children, boys especially, wear toy pistols in holsters around their waist or carry pop rifles. Visitor Sarah Cain has been coming to the show for two years, since she moved to Denver from Houston, and says she loves coming here to see the animals and the mix of children, old people, city slickers, wannabes, and the “actual thing,” her term for ranchers. Most informants distinguish between urban and rural ways of life. For example, visitor Jenny Reynolds portrays city people as caring less about the land and showing less individualism.</p>
            <p>Regarding informants’ relations with animals, 12 have raised cattle. Beverly and John Miller used to show animals here, as did James Night, and James and Matilda Night’s children carry on the tradition in showing animals here. Two competed in rodeos: Walter Emory is a former bull rider, rodeo clown, and judge; Fred Johnson rode saddle‐broncs. Fifteen visitors have no experience with the cattle industry, although four have pets, two have horses, two say that they love horses, and one hunts.</p>
            <p>Yet these distinctions between ranch and nonranch consumers are not as clean as they would appear. Of the 14 informants with ranch experience, seven no longer live on a ranch. Shelly Kessler, Walter Emory, Sue Snyder, and Linda Daniels left ranching when they left their parents’ homes. Marvin Caldwell left ranching years ago when the price of beef fell, and he now raises horses as a hobby. Alejandro Nuñez raised cattle 10 years ago and now works as a teacher. Mary Hawkins worked as a ranch‐hand.</p>
            <p>Conversely, many nonranch visitors claim a strong affiliation for rural life. Jenny Reynolds credits her husband’s ranch background in Montana for their two daughters now keeping a horse. Sarah Cain and her husband have a horse and are “pretend to be country‐livers.” She did not grow up on a farm, although two different farms have been passed down through several generations in her family. Ed Canelli dreams of having a few acres some day. Roger Adler is making arrangements to raise cattle with three other men. He figures they will need $45,000 to get started with a small herd of cows, and they will then go from there.</p>
            <p>There are important generational dimensions in show consumption as well. Ranch and nonranch informants recall parents, grandparents, and other family members living on farms and ranches, reflecting the fact that most Americans are but a few generations off the farm. For those who grew up on farms and ranches, coming to the show reclaims their cultural heritage, and many bring their children and even grandchildren to transfer cultural traditions and memories. Shelly Kessler, who grew up on a farm in Iowa, notes that coming here brings back her past, a time when people were more down‐to‐earth, friendly, and relaxed. She adds that every once in a while she runs into someone she knew then. Marvin Caldwell has come to Denver from Wyoming to see the show and explains his long‐standing family ties to western culture, “My grandfather was half Cherokee, and homesteaded in Wyoming. His son, my father, was a blacksmith.” Oklahomans Beverly and John Miller used to come to the stock show regularly with their children. Fifteen years later they return with granddaughter, Lynn, who is showing sheep.</p>
            <p>Yet even those without ranch experience find elements of the nation’s agricultural heritage and beef industry appealing and worthwhile. Heather and Alan Banks have brought their children, “so they’ll know where their food comes from,” as Heather explains. Darlene and Bob Lawrence have come “to see the kids show off the animals they’ve raised.” African‐American Marilyn James has come to “learn all kinds of things, to look at the animals and watch the people, see how the whole ranch thing works, see where meat comes from. It’s like a little culture—very interesting type of dress, distinctive. It’s a big social gathering, a family thing.”</p>

            <title>Attending the Parade</title>
            <p>Each year the show begins with a short parade through downtown Denver. Spectators wave and cheer the participants. Police officers lead the parade on horseback, followed by the Westernaires, a riding group wearing enough red, white, and blue to dispel any doubts as to what country we are in. Next, in horse‐drawn buggies, come show organizers, celebrities, and sponsors: the mayor, Miss Rodeo America, and representatives of a local restaurant, a radio station, a country‐and‐western bar, and Coors brewery. Adults point out the various animals to small children. Workers on lunch breaks gawk and giggle as icons of the Old West pass between modern buildings. There is a Buffalo Bill impersonator riding a longhorn steer and a cowboy atop a llama. Last is a Safeway refrigerated car, a fitting reminder of the destination of the cattle shown here.</p>

            <title>Consuming the Animals</title>
            <p>Seeing the animals is the main objective of most visitors. Unlike a zoo, there are domestic animals here, primarily cattle, and their display and treatment at various show venues is noteworthy. In the stockyards visitors walk past scores of cattle and other animals. At the Children’s Ranchland visitors enter a large pen and pet varieties of baby animals. Most typically, consumers are spectators, sitting away from the action in the stands and watching the rodeo, the stock competitions, and other entertainment events.</p>
            <sec id="sc3.4.1">
               <title>Ranchland.</title>
               <p>This animal exhibit is part of a large area for children, which includes miniature train rides, a climbing gym, a snack bar, and several booths. There are several kid goats, sheep, and lambs walking about, and two piglets and a calf are kept in wooden crates that allow the children to reach in and pet them. The exhibit is sponsored by the <italic>Denver Post</italic>, and student volunteers from the Future Farmers of America (FFA) monitor the area to ensure the safety of the children and animals. It is quite popular, often with a line to get in, and from time to time I see groups of children on school‐sponsored field trips. “Coming to the show is the best thing that can happen to these kids,” says ranch visitor James Night, “Some of them never see an animal and here they see ’em right close!” Nonranch visitor Denise Matthews brings her three‐year old nephew because the animals are the boy’s favorite. “Teaching kids about animals fosters the western atmosphere,” she explains (fig. 1).<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg1" position="float" seq="1">

               </p>
               <p>Across from Ranchland are several booths. One gives pony rides, complete with a souvenir photo set against the backdrop of a western landscape, for $10. Others feature a honeybee hive, a figure of a cow showing its four stomachs, and a feed box listing what a cow eats every day to produce 6 gallons of milk: 15 lbs. of alfalfa, 45 lbs. of silage, 10 lbs. of cottonseed, 15 lbs. of rolled corn, 1 lb. of vitamins and minerals, and 65 gallons of water. While an excellent outreach to children, beef cattle production dominates in the show and in the West.</p>
               <p>Here, too, are baby animals with their mothers in cages. On each cage is a sign with the animals’ names and a short tale with information on their productive uses. An example is Calamity Jane, the goose that likes to travel in the back seat of a car and whose feathers are used in jackets and quilts. Interestingly, none of the signs mention the use of these animals for food.</p>
               <p>Interactions between adults and young children are particularly noteworthy. I observe parents guiding their children through the show, reading the signs to them, and passing on the industry‐supplied bits of information. Later, many buy their children souvenirs—guns, ropes, and cowboy hats—and take photographs of them with the animals. Edible treats, ice cream and cotton candy, further mark the outing as festive.</p>
               <p>The way in which young people are encouraged to identify with the animals at the same time that they are taught their production uses is significant. In featuring baby animals, many of them with their mothers, and telling stories that personalize them, the displays encourage children to make attachments to the animals (Arluke and Sanders 1996; Leach 1982). In naming these animals, as with the breed stock, the tenuous line between humans and animals is smoothed over, casting them into the category of pets. Yet, their display in the context of productive uses simultaneously shifts them away from pets, providing visitors with a disjointed experience. States nonranch visitor Sara Cain, “I think ranchers realize that in the end it’s a business, but that doesn’t mean they can’t get attached.” Nonranch visitor Jenny Reynolds’s 15‐year‐old daughter, Karen, offers a more pragmatic comment on the animals here, “I’d rather be fed than not.”</p>

               <title>The Stock Pens.</title>
               <p>Out in the yards, consumers peruse hundreds of cattle, along with various breeds of horses, sheep, and hogs, which are in pens, tied to posts being groomed, or awaiting their events. Walking through the pens, I recall nonranch visitor Mary Hawkins’s use of the term “westernity” to describe the stock show. “Everybody is here,” she notes, “it’s a cultural thing. You see lotta western wannabes as well as hard core ranchers that live the lifestyle. You see the Denverites come out and wear their cowboy boots for a day and hop around in cow shit. It’s entertainment!” She has worked as a wrangler and ridden in the Westernaires, and she explains that “the cattle business is more advanced than they make it out to be here. There’s a lot of technology.”</p>
               <p>Many cattle are held such that their rear quarters are displayed prominently in order to emphasize their prime cuts of meat. In grooming the animals for show or sale, ranchers shave, shampoo, and blow‐dry their fur. Most cattle here are purebred, and their production by ranchers for particular genetic qualities is the more prestigious part of the industry. In contrast, the majority of cattle are crossbred and produced for beef by commercial ranchers.5</p>

                     <p>The beef industry has evolved over time, such that most ranchers raise animals for sale to a few feedlots, where they are fattened and sold to packers, and from there they are slaughtered and packaged for sale to grocery stores and restaurants (Peñaloza 2000).</p>

               <title>The Stock Shows.</title>
               <p>Twenty‐two breeds of cattle are shown here. Ten breed associations hold national shows; others are regional in scope. The dominant breeds of U.S. cattle, Angus and Hereford, are shown, as are other well‐known breeds, including Charolais and Limosin, and rarer breeds such as the Scotch Highland. “The purpose of the shows is competition—to find out how well you’re standing,” explains ranch visitor John Miller, “the ones who show animals strive to make them as good as they can be.”</p>
               <p>Curious visitors wander in and out of the shows, and ranchers are helpful in answering their questions. Though consumers rarely purchase meat by breed, there is a growing trend in the industry to differentiate them.6 Comments nonranch visitor Marilyn James, “it’s interesting to see how docile the big animals are. They’re there for a purpose—it’s about competition and camraderie. It’s not that big of an industry, so they all know one another. There’s that friendship. Everybody I’ve met is really nice. The whole camraderie brings people in.”</p>
               <p>The breed associations are important social communities for ranchers; they can share concerns regarding the breed and exchange news about their families and businesses. Other activities include board and general membership meetings, electing officers, and filling the one post reserved for women, the breed association queen.</p>
               <p>The queens are part of some intriguing gender dynamics at the male‐dominated shows. I gain some insight into the role by talking to Kim Dugan, the 1993 Miss Polled Hereford. The humor I felt at initially seeing her banner and tiara turns into admiration as she describes what getting the job entailed—knowledge of the breed, animal handling skills, and public relations. At the shows the queen presents awards to the winners.</p>
               <p>Stock shows are categorized by the status of the handler, professional or junior, together with various divisions of stock by sex and age. The animals are led around the ring by their owner or an agent, and both animal and handler are judged (fig. 2). Ranch visitor John Miller stresses the handlers’ care of the animals, “the ones who show animals are showing their animals with love.” Adds ranch visitor James Night, “It’s a good show, shows the man and the animal—sometimes we get better animals than cowboys!”<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg2" position="float" seq="2">

               </p>
               <p>Each show is judged by a specially qualified team or individual. The intimate relation between the cattle industry and agricultural educational programs is evident in their training, which often includes FFA, 4H (Head, Heart, Hands, and Health), and collegiate judging teams. Judges examine the build and carriage of each animal and the skills of its handler. Cattle are led by a rope, hogs are directed with a stick, and lambs are handheld, with their neck braced along the handler’s thigh to encourage the animal to flex its rear quarters. Junior competitors work their animals, while adults either show them or pay professional cattle fitters to do so. Most are men, but some women groom and show animals.</p>
               <p>The resemblance between the animal competitions and women’s beauty contests is striking, with both types of contestants positioned before the eyes of the judge and the viewing public (Cohen, Wilk, and Stoeltje 1996).7 Additional parallels include the descriptions of contestants, the use of makeup to cover flaws, and the use of Preparation H in shrinking puffy eyes. For example, in one show the judge describes the winning heifer, distinguishing its “large shapely udders, smooth facial features, and ability to attract a mate.” Later I write in my field notes, “How does he know what attracts a bull?”</p>
               <p>Also related to gender is the interreferentiality of human and animal traits. In a fascinating expression of anthropomorphism, bulls are often referred to as men by visitors and ranchers, just as cows are referred to as women. This, combined with incessant talk of animal reproduction, reflects and further reinforces traditional human gender roles. Perhaps this observation results from my outsider status; a key feminist principle is recognizing that human gender is not solely a biological imperative but also reflects social norms. At any rate, the talk of cows as the essence of motherhood, and bulls as manly in their strength, vitality, and seed production, gives some indication of the importance that traditional family values have for this subculture.</p>

Another example is Coleman beef, produced without pesticides and hormones (Voynick 1998).</p>

               <title>The Stock Sales.</title>
               <p>Each sale begins with introductions of the breed association president, the queen, an auctioneer, a veterinarian, and two or three spotters who note the bids. Brochures list information on each animal’s owners, past winnings, and growth statistics, as well as those of its ancestors. Like the shows, the sales are organized by the age and sex of the animals, individually, in groups, or in car‐ and pen‐load sales (fig. 3).<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg3" position="float" seq="3">

               </p>
               <p>At the pounding of the auctioneer’s gavel, the bidding begins. The auctioneer barks out the upped ante of the bids, in between chattering the bid's present mark in virtually undecipherable, rapidly repetitive monosyllables. From time to time he stops, goading the crowd into offering more favorable bids by reviewing the animal’s characteristics.</p>
               <p>The sales are open to the public and attract curious visitors. Advises ranch visitor Marty Patton, “The focus of the show is on the animals, the rodeo, and the entertainment for the people from the cities. You have to look harder for the commercial activities.” He also intimates the traditional gender roles in ranch families, “Here [at the show] she picks the cattle for him to bid on, and then goes shopping at the [exhibit] booths.”</p>
               <p>Like the shows, this is no mere entertainment. The audience comprises mostly ranchers and cattle dealers intent on the sales, with many making notes in their brochures. The bidding is quite subtle, involving the tip of a hat, a lifted finger, or simply a head nod, and it takes me several sales and some help by the ranchers to follow the action. Visitors comment on not wanting to make a bid by mistake, and they seldom stay long, their curiosity satisfied. After a sale, the buyer’s number and price are recorded. There are gasps at high prices, over $100,000 for some animals, and disgusted shakes of heads at low ones, less than $1,000, for as the ranchers explain, each animal listed will be sold, and not all sellers will get their desired price. Even ranchers admit they do not always understand the differences in prices. Notes ranch visitor Marty Patton, “I don’t understand why one bull will bring $15,000 and the next, $4,000. They look identical to me.”</p>
               <p>Of all the sales, the Junior Livestock Auction of Champions garners the most visitor participation. The philanthropic affair showcases Denver elites in fancy western dress supporting the junior ranchers. Broadcast live on local television, the event begins with music by the Barnstormers and features renown cowboy poet Baxter Black as emcee, an auctioneer, a veterinarian, and four spotters in tuxedos to note the bids.</p>
               <p>Sale prices are a good indication of the health of local businesses and of the beef industry overall. In 1992 Jerry Tucker and his grand champion steer Fonto drew $18,000 from Paul's Place Restaurant and Lombardi Meat Packers. Two years later Sarah Lewis’s steer Montana went for $50,000 from the same sources. The event was mired in controversy in 1995 when Ryan Rash’s steer Badger was disqualified for steroids a few days after it had sold for $37,500 to the same donor. In 1998 Dee Lincoln of the Del Frisco Double Eagle Steak House outbid Paul's Place Restaurant and Lombardi Meat Packers, paying $80,000 to Justin Lauridson for his grand champion, Taz.</p>
               <p>In a twist of corporate philanthropy, Paul’s Place Restaurant and Lombardi Meat Packers not only have paid top dollar five of the previous six years but each year donate the meat to the homeless. At 700 lbs. per carcass, that comes to a donation of roughly $70 per pound of low quality meat. The inefficiency of this tax break is beside the point; more important is the publicity and goodwill gained among ranchers and the public.</p>
               <p>Informants are mixed in their reactions to the animals at the shows and sales. Nonranch visitor Doug Daniels reports his belief that there is more public concern for the plight of the animals than there was 50 years ago. For nonranch visitor Marilyn James it is hard seeing the “sales aspect of the animals,” as she refers to it, but then she pauses and adds thoughtfully, “I guess it’s no different than going to the pet store. But I don’t like the thought of the kids raising the animals and having them slaughtered. I mean, I can’t believe they don’t get attached to it. But I’d rather not know. If they keep calves in pens I’d rather not know. I don’t want to see pictures. I think they should have humane conditions as for the treatment of animals though.” Others are less concerned. “People are raising the animals. They’re gonna be slaughtered anyway, so why not win a prize and make more money off it?” shrugs nonranch visitor Bob Lawrence.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="sc3.4.5">
               <title>The Rodeo.</title>
               <p>The rodeo is a big draw for visitors. Nonranch visitor Ed Canelli describes it as “a tool to bring more people to the show.” Nonranch visitor Bob Lawrence describes it as “fun to watch.” His wife, nonranch visitor Darlene Lawrence, is less sure, explaining that when she told people at work that she was going to the rodeo, they told her it was cruel. “I don’t think it’s cruel, necessarily, it’s more entertainment now,” she says, emphasizing its present form.</p>
               <p>The rodeo events are anchored in history, as they feature particular skills that cowboys have developed over the years, yet the events are modified for dramatic effect. Announcers and the rodeo program report that it began as a competition among cowboys, with no mention of its Spanish roots. Scholars emphasize the rodeo as a ritual celebration of animal domestication (Lawrence 1982) and the working‐class status of the cowboys (Allmendinger 1992), yet it also serves important commercial functions here. Although much of the wild in the rodeo is human‐induced, its symbolic role at the stock show is significant in retaining elements of the Wild West, in contrast to the thoroughly rationalized beef industry shows and sales.</p>
               <p>Twice a day during the week and three times daily on weekends, folks file into the coliseum. With few exceptions, the rodeos sell out, with booth exhibitors attentive to traffic flows before and after each performance through the Education Hall. A stage band greets entrants with well‐known western songs, such as “The Rose of San Antone.” Spectator groups include young and old couples and extended families, many with children. Huge banners list the sponsors: Dodge Trucks, United Airlines, and Pepsi Cola, with the logo of Skoal Chewing Tobacco lighting the scoreboard.</p>
               <p>The rodeo begins dramatically, with the lights out. Suddenly, the Westernaires thunder into the arena on horseback, red lights atop their hats bobbing in unison. The volunteer riders fan out in geometric formations not unlike a band’s halftime performance at a prep football game. The 1997 performance is particularly suspense‐filled, as the emcee informs us of a collision the previous year that killed one rider.</p>
               <p>My observations of a dozen rodeo performances reveal a marked regularity in their sequence of events, with prize money reflecting the degree of difficulty and risk of injury in individual events. Each event is branded, in the sense that each has a corporate sponsor.8 Prior to each event, a rider on horseback carries a banner sporting the company's logo around the arena. Afterward, the winner accompanies the rider on a victory lap, banner flying high.</p>
               <p>The first two events are saddle bronc and bareback riding, with total earnings of $64,000 each. For the latter event there is no saddle to hang on to; instead, the cowboys grip a leather strip bound around the horse’s middle, just behind its forelegs. In each event riders mount their horses, await the opening of the gate, and ride in proper form for the allotted time, with their score based on the quality of the horse’s bucking and the rider’s form. Making the horse buck is a cinch pulled tight over its lower pelvic area—and its breeding, notes rodeo cowboy Darryl Jackson, whose family raises rodeo stock.</p>
               <p>Not a minute of time is left idle between events. While the cowboys and rodeo staff prepare for the next event, rodeo bullfighters entertain the crowd. The term “bullfighter” has come into use only recently; most people continue to call them rodeo clowns for their colorful dress and makeup. Their humor consists of jokes about dumb animals, animal sexual habits, fat wives, ugly mothers‐in‐law, and the black skin of one of the bullfighters. Over the years, the audience has responded to the humor in a range of mild amusement to scattered outrage and complaints, to the point that one bullfighter was fired and the other two bullfighters and the emcee resigned in protest before the 1998 show. Explaining their action, organizers cited their need to respond to an increasingly urban audience while appealing to ranchers (Booth 1997).</p>
               <p>Next, calf ropers and steer wrestlers compete for $78,000 each in prize money. In calf roping, a cowboy on horseback pursues a calf that is let out of a chute, ropes it by the neck, dismounts, throws it on the ground, and ties three of its four legs together in the shortest time possible. In steer wrestling, a cowboy on horseback pursues a young steer released from a chute and rides alongside it, leaning over and grabbing it by the horns, twisting its neck, and using his weight to fell the steer. Although former cattle rancher Alejandro Nuñuz likes the rodeo, he expresses dislike for these events for breaking the necks of some of the calves. Nonranch visitor Jenny Reynolds, who says she likes the rodeo, describes the calf roping and steer wrestling as mean.</p>
               <p>Only one event is open to women, barrel racing, with earnings totaling $58,000. Each contestant races against time, entering the arena on horseback at full gallop, circling three barrels as closely as possible without toppling them over, and then speedily racing out of the arena to the cheering of the crowd. Members of the audience are particularly boisterous for the contestants from Colorado.</p>
               <p>Midway through the rodeo are other performances: the Westernaires, the skilled drivers of three specialty horse hitches, and a well‐known animal trainer. The Westernaires deftly form figure eights in one direction and then the other, with a finale consisting of three riders standing in their saddles as their horses gallop around the arena. Next, drivers direct a beautifully matched team of miniature horses, an impressive team of black regular‐sized horses, and the gigantic Budweiser Clydesdales. The audience cheers loudly in greeting each team, and the drivers take turns speeding the horses around the arena and skillfully turning, stopping, and even backing them up. The emcee adds drama to the events by explaining their difficulty. Other performances have varied over the years, ranging from a man who rides a buffalo to the top of his 18‐wheel trailer to the horse used in the Disney film <italic>Black Beauty</italic>, with his trainer, to a horseman who twirls a rope in a circle large enough for his horse to ride through it.</p>
               <p>The rodeos are not all professional entertainment, however. Toward the end of each one, local youths compete in contests. In mutton‐busting, young children, approximately four–six years old, don a football helmet and attempt to ride a sheep. The audience cheers heartily in amusement at each child's attempt, and most slip off into the dust. All contestants receive large trophies, some taller than they are; winners receive passes from United Airlines to fly four people anywhere in the United States. In the catch‐a‐calf contest, 30 or so junior and senior high school students entertain the audience by scrambling to catch one of 20 calves in a roped off area in the main arena. Winners agree to raise the calves and compete in next year’s show (fig. 4)<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg4" position="float" seq="4">

               <p>The climax of the rodeo is the bull riding, featuring Brahman bulls with medium‐sized horns and a characteristic hump between their shoulders. At $100,000, this event has the highest payoff and poses the greatest danger. The goal is to ride the bucking bull in proper form for eight seconds (fig. 5). As with the bucking bronc events, a cinch drawn tight over the lower pelvis makes the bulls buck, and the riders are judged based on the quality of the bull’s bucking and the rider’s form. Over the years I have seen several cowboys injured; most limp away, although some are carried off in an ambulance. The crowd, suddenly somber, claps loudly in support as he exits. Bullfighters earn their salaries in this event. Although they joke throughout the rodeo, it is their physical acumen in distracting the angry bulls after riders have been thrown off or finish their rides that routinely saves riders' lives. Also helpful are two riders on horseback who watch for an opportune moment to ride alongside the agitated bull, providing the cowboy an escape. Once he is safe, they ride abreast the bull to loosen the cinch and guide it out of the arena.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg5" position="float" seq="5">

               <p>Noteworthy at the rodeo are its Wild West spectacle and the athleticism of the cowboys. Visitor Mary Hawkins compares it to the Olympics, saying that “it’s a chance for people who are the best in their sport to compete.” Darryl Jackson, the 1993 World Bareback Bronco Riding Champion, explains that while the events originated from the need to develop and show off skills used on the range, over time they have evolved into crowd‐pleasing, money‐making activities. Like other professional athletes, rodeo cowboys begin in local, amateur events and advance to become professionals, with only a few earning enough to live. Jackson expresses strong connections to the animals he rides, “They are born to buck. A good rider knows he’s dependent on the animal to get a good score, and respects him. The actual life we lead is so different from what you see here or in Hollywood movies—like when it’s cold outside and 2 <sc>a.m</sc>. we’re the ones making sure that cow doesn’t lose that calf.” He says he is thrilled to see city folk walking around here in western wear, because they are showing their appreciation.</p>

               <title>Other Entertainment.</title>
               <p>The remaining attractions celebrate animal domestication in other ways. Horse events are held in the Equestrian Center, a $10 million facility added in 1997. Nonranch visitor Donna Aiello’s favorite attractions are the Percheron horses and the unicorn hitches, which arrange three horses in a triangle pulling a carriage. A nurse, Donna has come to the show from a nearby town with a friend expressly to see these attractions. As we watch, she points out the drivers’ skills in using voice commands and flicking the reins from atop the carriages in directing the horses.</p>
               <p>The Coors draft horses are another favorite, as measured by the large enthusiastic audiences. The drivers reenact delivering beer to a loading dock, turning and backing up the large animals in maneuvering the wagons. Cutting horse competitions are less popular, with a scattering of spectators watching men on horseback separate a calf from its herd. Somewhat related is the sheep dog contest, in which dogs herd a flock of sheep. Finally, horse and dog pulls are quite popular, with large spirited crowds watching dogs and horses compete for prizes in trying to pull the heaviest load.</p>
               <p>The few events not tied to the West are the English riding competitions, which include hunter/jumpers, high‐stepping Morgans, Arabians, and thoroughbreds. Hundreds of local and regional horse and carriage competitors wear formal English jodhpurs, blazers, boots, and top hats. Their posting style of riding contrasts with the western riding style, just as the exclusivity and restraint of the audiences at the English riding events contrasts with the easygoing populism of the boisterous audiences at the western events.</p>

            <title>Touring the Merchandise Booths</title>
            <p>The final element of the show consists of the 600 exhibit booths filling the aptly named Education Hall. Here, retail stores, entrepreneurs, and federal and state nonprofit agencies pay $500 and up to place merchandise and/or ideas before 600,000 plus attendees. Prime sites line the route from the shuttle bus stop to the rodeo coliseum. Exhibit space is so popular that despite expansions there is a three‐year waiting list for space.</p>
            <p>Booth exhibits feature a range of products and services. Industry‐related offerings including cattle chutes, trailers, feed, and inoculation and breeding services add authenticity to the show for consumers and are an important part of their entertainment. Nonranch visitors Shelly Kessler, Alison Wright, Heather and Alan Banks, and Ed Canelli especially enjoy walking through the exhibits, as do former ranchers Marvin Caldwell and Walter Emory. Alison finds the displays interesting. Walter enjoys seeing the exhibits, particularly the machinery and western clothes. Caldwell buys socks; Alan Banks buys an axle for his trailer. Even so, ranch visitor John Miller, who has been coming to the show for years, laments that the increased booth merchandising is making the show too commercial. His concern is shared by a few ranchers.</p>
            <p>Importantly, visitors consume the West as much by strolling through the exhibit booths and purchasing items, as by being a spectator at the rodeo and petting the animals. This is partly because most of the booths have a western tie‐in. An example is a booth capitalizing on the Old West theme by selling “instant ancestors” (fig. 6). For $15, consumers are photographed in the attire of a western gunslinger or barmaid against the backdrop of a saloon. Other examples include “stock show specials” on cowboy hats, boots, snakeskin belts, and even purses made of bull’s scrotal sacs. Also featured are booths for western cultural activities, such as the local dance halls; events, such as the Cheyenne Frontier Days; and tourist destinations such as Deadwood, SD.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg6" position="float" seq="6">

            </p>
            <p>Yet even those booths not related to western culture gain some association by being here. There are booths featuring jacuzzis for the home in various styles and colors. At another booth women try out that exercise “miracle,” the Thighmaster. A similar layout is used by Ralph Sims in selling massagers. The mix of general interest booths and industry‐related booths encourages interactions between visitors and ranchers.</p>
            <p>Notably, the winners of the West, white ranchers, and their rural way of life is celebrated in the booths in art, humor, country music, clothing including gold lamé appliquéd jackets, crafts including homemade jellies and relish, and crocheted items. These artifacts are intermingled with Native American and Mexican styles of jewelry, clothing, and home furnishings, commonly referred to as “Southwestern” items, a term that appropriates their cultural origins.</p>
            <p>Western artwork appears in several booths and in a gallery sponsored by Coors brewery. Although depictions of Native Americans grace much of the artwork, Native Americans are conspicuously absent at the show. Their absence here is countered by a large exhibit of art produced by Native Americans, which is held across town.</p>
            <p>Several of the booths feature western humor. While some of it has general appeal, much is irrelevant, misunderstood, or even offensive to nonranchers. The humor plays on the ironies of rural life, a good part of which revolves around managing the reproductive behavior of animals, and scoffs at traditional human gender roles. Examples include T‐shirts objectifying cowboys and cowgirls. For the guys (gals), “Kneel (Lie) down and do exactly what the good cowgirl (cowboy) tells you to do.” Another mimics a personal ad in a newspaper, listing criteria for a desired man as large amounts of land and cattle, and tight buns. Other jokes feature conflicts with out‐groups. An example is the Ford booth featuring a sleek black four‐wheel drive truck to be raffled off and a T‐shirt that taunts Chevy owners, “This is your brain Ford, this is your brain on drugs, Chevrolet.” Another example is the bookstore booth featuring the bumper sticker, “Tofu Free '93!” in reference to conflicts between ranchers and vegetarians.</p>
            <p>A final category of booths relates to food and beef consumption. The demonstrations of cooking appliances are consistently popular. The salsa maker, stove‐top grill, and no‐stick pan booths share this successful strategy in attracting a crowd: they set up on a stage above the floor so that the work space is easily viewed by passersby. Each is located at the end of an aisle, and each demonstrator uses a microphone headset (fig. 7)<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg7" position="float" seq="7">

            </p>
            <p>I watch again and again, fascinated, as the pitches become predictable. The demonstrators begin by making small talk to passersby as they ready the materials. Once a person stops, it is only a matter of time before others do so to see what s/he is looking at. At times onlookers number as many as 15 persons, but more often there are six–eight. The demonstrators are skilled entertainers, cracking jokes at themselves and the audience and working to create a dialogue as they use the equipment to make salsa, grill chicken, or fry an egg. Typically, they make references to traditional gender roles, with the woman in charge of cooking and pleasing her man, and he in charge of spending decisions and pleasing her. The demonstrators then hand out samples and field questions from the audience. Finally, they work to close the sale, looking directly at the persons most closely watching and asking how many they would like, emphasizing that the special prices are good only at this show. This is the moment of truth, as most in the audience walk away, yet one or two people usually buy an item.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, very few of the 600 booths directly refer to consuming beef. The Colorado Cattlewomen’s booth distributes information and recipes for 20‐minute meals to feed the family that are provided by the Beef Council, the major national promotional agency. Here, Jane Chapman informs me that only in the last couple of years has the number of people in Colorado surpassed the number of cattle, and that over 1 million cattle are slaughtered annually at the nearby Con Agra meatpacking plant.</p>
            <p>Highlighting the Safeway booth at the exit of the Education Hall is an exhibit comparing meat produced in the l940s and 1950s with that produced in the l990s. The contrast is dramatic: the 1950 cuts of meat had a three‐quarter inch layer of fat that is missing in the 1990 cuts, and today’s steer is lean, almost anorexic, in contrast to the robust 1940s animal. Like several booths, the Safeway booth keeps its prime location each year. Midway through the show the winners of the Junior steer competition are featured here, hanging from a meat hook, with placard listing their weight, 711 lbs.; quality grade, low choice; and breed, cross (fig. 8). Posted by the exhibit, I note a range of reactions. Notes visitor Doug Daniels, “here’s a cow (<italic>sic</italic>) and a person who worked together—it’s very hard to become the grand champion and that’s the lot for the cow.” Several parents instruct their children that this is where hamburger comes from. Many children react by showing surprise and disgust, while a few simply nod their heads. There are gender distinctions, as men typically joke about how the sides of beef make them hungry, while women and children grimace. Watching, I recall the Beef Council’s long‐running advertisement, “Beef—It’s What’s For Dinner.”<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg8" position="float" seq="8">

            <p>In response to my questions regarding diet, six ranch and seven nonranch visitors say that they eat meat regularly. Asserts ranch visitor James Night, “There’s nothing better for you than beef.” Nonranch visitor Ed Canelli describes his family as beef eaters, “We need a balanced diet—meat and dairy are essential.” As she tells me that she eats meat regularly, nonranch visitor Marilyn James adds that “somebody’s got to do it—it’s a dirty job. I don’t want to do it. But they [animals] were put on this earth for a reason—to eat, and I like to eat them.” Three additional ranch and three nonranch visitors say they feel they should cut back their meat consumption but have not done so; this group includes former cattle rancher Alejandro Nuñez, who says he ate meat during every meal last week.</p>
            <p>Of the six nonranch and four ranch visitors who eat less red meat, two have a heart condition, and one has problems with cholesterol. Nonranch visitor Sarah Cain no longer eats veal, while nonranch visitor Jenny Reynolds prepares less red meat for her family, adding that her two teenagers will not eat pork. Nonranch visitor Linda Daniels describes her and her husband Doug as health‐conscious. Since he developed a cholesterol problem, they have curtailed their beef consumption, but “that’s not what people here want to hear!” she jokes. Ranch visitor Walter Emory has changed his diet because of a heart condition, but he admits that “it’s pretty hard to get away from this red meat when you’ve lived on it all your life.” Ranch visitor Beverly Miller says she cut most cholesterol out of their diet after husband John had a heart attack. Nodding, John informs me that ranchers here are breeding cattle for less fat.</p>
            <p>Three visitors say that they believe the industry is responding to their health concerns. Notes ranch visitor Walter Emory, “Everybody here is pushing for leaner meat.” Notes nonranch visitor Cindy Patterson, “The industry has responded to health concerns by making meat simple to prepare and by presenting it as part of a healthy, modern lifestyle.” Even so, she admits that seeing the animals here makes her uncomfortable, adding that after seeing chickens crowded together in cages, she could not eat chicken for weeks.</p>
            <p>Five nonranch visitors raise concerns about ranchers’ use of chemicals and the impacts of ranching on the environment. Marilyn James says that at times she worries about chemicals in the meat. Cindy Patterson criticizes ranchers’ use of pesticides and large amounts of water. Heather Banks is concerned with the use of hormones and chemicals as well: “I wish they wouldn’t pump the animals up,” she sighs, “but it’s all yield. You’re talking about people’s lives. I don’t know where the mark‐up comes—ranchers don’t make that much per animal.” Yet while visitors’ concerns are concentrated among those without ranch experience, several ranchers raise similar concerns, pointing out that they eat the meat that they produce because it does not contain chemicals.</p>

            <title>Consumers’ Assessments</title>
            <p>In discussing their thoughts on the show, consumers highlight its commerce and depictions of the West, particularly of rural life. Regarding its commercial purposes, four ranch and four nonranch visitors describe the show as mostly business in buying and selling cattle. “It’s a culture of competition,” says nonranch visitor Cindy Patterson. “The purpose of the show is to make money!” states nonranch visitor Jenny Reynolds. Ranch visitor James Night is more specific, “You can double or triple your money if you do well in the shows.” Five ranch and one nonranch visitors say the show promotes agricultural practices, while five nonranch and three ranch visitors emphasize its roles in teaching the public about raising cattle. Nonranch visitor Ed Canelli emphasizes the wonderment of nonranchers, “People are fascinated with the animals—cattle, sheep, goats, and especially horses.” At the same time, he describes the show as “an opportunity for the cattle people. Not often do you get so much exposure for your product.”</p>
            <p>Most ranch and nonranch visitors make associations between the stock show and the West, listing such qualities as friendliness (8), the distinct characteristics of the land (4), freedom (4), pride in work (4), cowboys and roughing it up (3), a slower pace of life (3), the way things used to be (3), and family (2). For former midwestern farmer Shelley Kessler, the West is “a kind of friendly, laid down attitude related to the land, the mountains, prairies. It's a style, a way to dress. It's an attitude, the kind of attitude that comes with the cowboys … it's kind of difficult to explain … it's in how they treat people, how they treat women and kids … they're honest and very trusting.” Says nonranch visitor Donna Aiello, “The West is wide open spaces, friendliness, informality—the openness of the land and the people, a more relaxed environment and a slower pace of life.”</p>
            <p>Informants’ comments jump back and forth in contrasting city and country life, East and West. James Night links the show to the West in emphasizing its distinct work ethic. “We grow the grain,” he explains, “we grow the beef that goes all over the world. The West is still free. We don’t have the kind of crime they do back East. People don’t have that kind of time on their hands. They’re working. It’s catching up in Denver, though.” In showing fascination with their rural other, and alternatively idealizing and criticizing the rural lifestyle, nonranch and ranch consumers enact the well‐known children’s allegory, the “Tale of the City Mouse and the Country Mouse.” Urban people revel in getting back to nature at the show, citing its romantic qualities of beauty and balance, even as they take issue with the inhumane treatment of animals in the rodeo and the use of pesticides and hormones in raising beef cattle.</p>
            <p>Their comments jump temporally as well, in describing the Old and New West. Nonranch visitor Denise Mathews describes the show as “representing U.S. history. It typifies America. It is wholesome, honest and friendly. It’s where I was born and where I want to die.” Nonranch visitor Darlene Lawrence, who recently has moved to Denver with her husband from St. Louis, says, “It’s still very new to me. I’m intrigued by people going across the mountains and traveling through Kansas. I had the boots and hat before I got here!” In contrast, ranch visitor Mary Hawkins describes the contemporary West as “a type of dress, a type of speech, the bars you go to.”</p>
            <p>Visitors with ranch experience describe nostalgia for a simpler time when they knew their neighbors, never locked their doors, and helped each other out. Others are less idealistic about the hard work. Laughs Marty Patton, “Why I’m just as handy as any old‐time cowboy!” Like Darryl Jackson, Patton's image of the West is “pulling a calf in zero degree weather.” Former rodeo cowboy Walter Emory moved to Colorado from Michigan when he was a boy and loves the atmosphere here, “It’s a wide open space, friendlier.” Laughing, he adds, “Of course, everybody has an idea that out West it’s wild country.”</p>
            <p>Former ranchers Marvin Caldwell and Alejandro Nuñez challenge the theme of individualism so widely associated with the West. As Caldwell states, “The West is an attitude about work and brotherhood and treating women with respect. You’re not afraid to cross the river and help—it’s not every man for himself.” Nuñez recalls growing up poor on their ranch: “It’s about family ties, freedom, self‐sufficiency. But it goes against the myth of individualism—there’s a lot of conformity here.” Despite Nuñez’ view that urban people do not value nature as much as they should, he enjoys seeing visitors walking around in awe of the ranchers and animals, adding, “It’s not like John Wayne in the movies! Animal production is not in balance with nature, but then nobody is. The business does keep us working, though.”</p>
            <p>Many nonranch visitors note ties between the West and the cattle industry as well, expressing their criticisms even as they animate the beliefs and culture of the West. Cindy Patterson says she feels seduced by the myth of the West, adding that “ranchers are making money, yet the business sustains a climate of poverty by limiting access to resources.” Still, she comes to see the rodeo and loves looking at the animals. For Doug Daniels, the West is “open spaces and being able to go out and ride horseback and go, you know, up in the mountains and get lost … it's getting away from the big cities, really. Basically, the West—it's got abundance and well, there's a lot of controversy—some saying the Old West has gotta go. It's cruel and inhumane and, you know, that we need to see a New West … these are the type of people that come here and try to change the way we live, but there’s a lot of tradition here.”</p>
            <p>Regarding gender, informants highlight increasing opportunities in the industry while noting that barriers remain. Nonranch visitors Jenny Reynolds, Sarah Cain, and Cindy Patterson and ranch visitors Alejandro Nuñez and Marty Patton describe the show as male‐dominated. Nonranch visitors Bob Lawrence and Marilyn Jones emphasize traditional gender roles. Says Lawrence, “Judging by the show, I’d say it’s still men are men and women are women.” Notes James, “I haven’t seen many women up front, but as many men as women are behind the scenes.” Others point to the work women that do. Says nonranch visitor Ed Canelli, “Women played an important role in western history. Here, I think our society tends to believe women are weaker, weaker physically, but that’s not the case.” Says former farmer Sue Snyder, “Women in the West are stronger and more independent. They’ve had to rely on themselves because that’s the nature of the ranching business.” Noting that his wife, Barb, keeps the (accounting) books and keeps him in line, ranch visitor Marty Patton admits ranching is “still a man’s world. Women work hard, but most are still doing traditional roles.” Nonranch visitor Denise Mathews observes that women’s participation in ranching has increased a lot over the years. Ranch visitor James Night agrees, adding that he believes it will improve as more women show livestock.</p>
            <p>Regarding race, ranch visitors Mary Hawkins and Alejandro Nuñuz and nonranch visitors Sue Snyder, Sarah Cain, Linda and Doug Daniels, and Darlene and Bob Lawrence describe the show as mostly white. As Hawkins says, “Just look at the demographics—you just don’t see too many who aren’t white,” but she does mention the Association of Black Cowboys and does note that there are some Hispanics here. Nonranch visitor Ed Canelli mentions the Latino roots of rodeo. Ranch visitor John Miller says that “I think anybody who wants to work in the industry is welcome. You’ve got Black and Indian ranchers in Oklahoma.” Former rancher Walter Emory says he never thought about it but can only think of one African‐American calf roper, “They just don’t seem to go into it.” Adds nonranch visitor Bob Lawrence, “It would be difficult to come and get involved. It's not a racial thing, I think people who have been here first and got the biggest chunk of the action are reluctant to give it up.” Nonranch visitor Marilyn James’ comment is similar: “Can’t say I’ve ever met a Black farmer. It seems like the show is more of a white ethnic thing. I mean, the Wild West—John Wayne, he’s white. I just don’t think there’s been a large minority interest to be involved with cattle.”</p>

            <title>The Nature of Consumer Behavior at the Stock Show</title>
            <p>The ethnographic account presents a range of consumer behaviors taken from consumer interviews and my observations: consumers strolling through the animal pens and promotional booths, examining and touching the animals and other products out of interest and curiosity; cheering at the rodeo, other entertainments, and animal sales and shows; interacting with family and friends they have come with, as well as ranchers, other visitors, and booth exhibitors, laughing and sharing stories; reading but a part of the vast array of information provided; role‐playing cowboy and city slicker; eating the available foods; and buying and using various products and services. Consumers exhibit a range of behaviors here that are common to many other consumption venues, such as theme parks (Davis 1997; O’Guinn and Belk 1989; Project on Disney 1995), sports events (Holt 1995), and music performances (Lipsitz 1994). However, the significance of consumers’ behavior here is somewhat distinctive, as this is a trade show for cattle.</p>
            <p>At a descriptive level of analysis, I organize consumers’ behaviors into three nonmutually exclusive categories. First, consumers experience the show primarily as entertainment. Consumers are not consuming the stock show as a trade show where they buy cattle or periphery equipment. For them, strolling past the animal pens and exhibit booths is an amusing pastime. Consumed in this way, the stock show exhibits qualities of a western‐themed mall and harvest festival celebration. Such strolling, seeing products and people, is reminiscent of the behavior of flaneurs studied by Walter Benjamin in the Arcades in Paris in the mid‐nineteenth century (Benjamin 1968; Buck‐Morss 1997). There is an important difference, however. Whereas many people came to the arcades from the country to see the novelties of the urban markets (Miller 1981), many people here are urban residents who come to see the trappings of rural culture. In each case, it is significant that consumers’ production is based on the contrasts between their cultural world and the one they are consuming.</p>
            <p>Spectating is an equally important consumer behavior at this show. The way that consumers find entertainment in the mix of the rough‐and‐tumble antics of the rodeo and the business activities of ranchers and booth exhibitors is striking. Reviewing the data, I find such spectating to be neither passive nor cleanly divided into fantasy and reality attributes, as Deighton (1992) suggested. Instead, in consuming this market performance, consumers actively make cultural meanings in blending fantasy with reality as they stroll and spectate at the various elements of this cattle trade show.</p>
            <p>Second, consumer behavior here is educational. Consumers learn about animals by wandering through the booths and watching the animal performances. They learn from ranchers and show and sales announcers how animals are handled and what is important to the industry. They learn about the rural way of life at the rodeo by watching the valued skills and frivolous antics of cowboys. They learn about the latest appliances and household furnishings for ranch and home from the booth exhibitors and their brochures and displays. They learn about the productive uses of the animals at Ranchland and in the materials provided by the breed associations. As importantly, consumers learn from each other, as they share what they learn here—parents to children, children to parents, booth exhibitors to consumers, consumers to booth exhibitors, ranchers to city folk, and city folk to ranchers.</p>
            <p>Third, much consumer behavior here is commercial. Business activity occurs at many levels, in the millions of dollars exchanged every year within and across the categories of ranchers, consumers, and exhibitors. There is buying and selling of animals, equipment, supplies, ranch and home furnishings, clothing, foods, and drink. There are pervasive marketing strategies designed to promote the show and its events to visitors and ranchers, such as the animal showing and grooming techniques at the breed shows and auction sales, and the exhibitors' booth design and merchandise displays.</p>
            <p>At a deeper level of analysis, I draw the fundamental dimensions of consumer behavior across this typology. Consumer behavior here is transactional, as consumers pay money to attend the entertaining and educational events. It is agential, as consumers direct themselves through the site, experiencing a panorama of the sights, sounds, and textures of the animals and inanimate products. It is didactic, as consumers educate themselves and their children about the mechanisms and institutions of food production. It is participative, as consumers involve themselves with the attractions and other people, and it is imaginative, as consumers incorporate the plethora of historical images into their activities in producing a fantastic, yet nonetheless very real culture of the West.</p>

            <title>Consumers’ Negotiation of Western Cultural Meaning and Memory</title>
            <p>The analysis of consumers’ cultural production proceeds in examining the substantive meanings consumers give to the show in relation to the previous typology of their behavior. Because the show is primarily amusement for consumers, one key is examining what makes the show fun and what takes away from it being fun for them.</p>
            <sec id="sc4.2.1">
               <title>Western Cultural Meanings.</title>
               <p>The following themes, while not exhaustive, represent the most prominent substantive meanings distilled from the interviews and observational data (fig. 9). Each of these themes represents a complex bundle of related and contradictory subthemes (Fernandez 1986). They are depicted as clouds to represent ethereal imaginings of the Old West in relation to very real market activities.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg9" position="float" seq="9">

                  </fig-group>
               </p>
               <p>First, cultural meanings regarding the place of humans and animals in the natural world are central to the cultural functioning of the show. Specifically, an inversion of naturalism over meat production captures the complicated relationship between humans and animals, and between consumers and producers here. At the show consumers reproduce naturalistic values that are virtually extinct in urban settings, except in gardens or on park outings. At the same time, they acknowledge the domestication of animals that is showcased in the language of custodianship and the techniques of high‐tech animal husbandry.</p>
               <p>Although many of the entertainment activities evoke the wild for visitors, most of the business activities center on its taming, as in the rodeo, or outright domestication, as in the animal husbandry. A benign domestication prevails here, such that consumers are able to pet the animals while accepting their use as food and raw materials. This benevolent naturalism is most visible at Ranchland. Yet, it also is evident in the shows, sales, and the rodeo, where consumers take pleasure in watching ranchers handle the elite breeding stock, impeccably grooming them and expertly managing their production.</p>
               <p>A second theme, market competition, occurs between breeders, between rodeo contestants for awards and prize money, and between exhibitors for the attention and dollars of thousands of people milling about. Further, such market competition occurs for breeders and rodeo contestants with their animals, in working with and against the animals' genetics and wills in showing them and performing the rodeo events, respectively. Competition is both a process of judgment and the basis for awarding prizes here, even as it plays an important role in negotiating industry and societal truths for consumers—regarding ranching activities and what constitutes a healthy diet. Yet, there is irony in consumers’ talk about ranching as exemplary of the positive legacy of market competition in this country, in emphasizing its efficiency in making money and feeding people. For this inverts the negative aspects of competition evident in the decreasing number of farmers and ranchers nationwide, which government subsidies seek to remedy. Notably, the small independent rancher celebrated here represents two‐thirds of cattle industry participants yet only 4% of sales, while 40% of beef is produced by large firms representing 2% of industry participants (McClain 1997).</p>
               <p>Third, the value of freedom and independence is commonly listed by visitors, ranchers, and booth exhibitors. The freedom and independence to live one’s life as one sees fit maintains an important place in visitors’, ranchers’, and booth exhibitors’ associations with the West, inverting the highly regulated social life in rural communities and the increasingly demanding competitive market conditions for beef production.</p>
               <p>Finally, family and community tradition is emphasized by visitors, ranchers, and booth exhibitors as an important part of the West. This theme captures the close social ties in families and rural communities. However, these ties are manifest in fairly rigid social hierarchies structured by age, gender, and race. Regarding age, deference to older people by youth is a commonly claimed by ranchers and attributed to them by visitors. Regarding gender, women are revered as queens and put on a pedestal, even as their hard work is a mainstay on most family‐owned ranches and remains behind the scenes at the show. While gender and age roles have changed over the years, their strong tradition prevails at the heart of this culture and is admired by many nonranch visitors. Regarding race, the show reflects the mythical version of western history, as it is populated predominantly by whites. Few visitors volunteer the racial composition of the show. When asked, their responses acknowledge few Native Americans, Latinos, African Americans, and Asians here and attribute this to a lack of interest and a lack of ancestors in the business.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="sc4.2.2">
               <title>Western Cultural Memory.</title>
               <p>Significantly, consumers’ cultural production at the show is not restricted to the present. Western meanings extend temporally back to the past, as consumers actively employ them in keeping alive important cultural traditions and values regarding nature, competition, freedom, and community, which are associated with the past development of this country. Meanings extend forward from past to present as well, as consumers invoke elements of the romanticized Old West in their comparisons of elements of rural and urban life. As such, the show serves as an exotic spatial‐temporal site for consumers, as old and new come together and apart, adding and taking away historical associations in producing western culture.</p>
               <p>Thus, cultural memory is a significant part of consumers’ cultural production here and contrasts with the loss of history in postmodernity and its proliferation of free‐floating signs separated from their referents (Baudrillard 1988; De Bord 1977; Firat and Venkatesh 1995). At the show, consumers consume history as a source of cultural authority that grounds the show activities. Yet, while historical tradition is fundamental to consumers in constructing cultural memory at the show, they evoke and recreate it selectively, and such cultural production cuts across sociotemporal domains.</p>
               <p>Here the dominance of ranchers over nonranchers, West over not‐West, men over women, adults over children, whites over nonwhites, and humans over animals is invoked, reinforced, and, to a lesser degree, contested. Notably, consumers’ cultural production here inverts some relations expressed in larger society (nonranchers over ranchers, East over West, children over adults), while reinforcing others (whites over nonwhites, men over women, humans over animals). Much production entails consuming another culture, one removed in time and/or space: nonranchers consuming ranch culture, whites consuming the western past of their ancestors and others, and, to a lesser degree, people of color consuming white rural culture.</p>
               <p>In this sense, the show shares characteristics with other Old West popular cultural products, such as the settlement promotions (Wrobel 1999), Buffalo Bill’s Wild West, and early western novels and film (as well as more contemporary novels and films). The show serves as an ongoing renegotiation of the past, even as western themes and values justify, legitimize, and even alter agents, activities, and relationships in the present.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="sc4.2.3">
               <title>Relational Cultural Production.</title>
               <p>Turner’s (1982) concept of inversion describes contradictions between the espoused values of members of a culture and their social practices. While helpful in labeling the contradictions between what consumers say the West means to them and their sense of show activities, my analysis goes further in focusing on the relational dynamics through which such inversions occur in this market.</p>
               <p>Consumers produce the West relationally, in negotiating between show activities and their imagined meanings. One key is to recognize that consumers distinguish between show activity and its imaginary elements, even as they combine them in making meanings (fig. 9). In the diagram part of figure 9, each bundle of cultural meanings is depicted inside the stock show (show activities), with another part depicted beyond it (imaginary realm). Importantly, it is a double inversion, as consumers retain the consumer dream over the realities of production in the Old West, whereas they emphasize the marvels of beef production over the realities of beef consumption at this show.</p>
               <p>As importantly, this is not a question of expectation/confirmation here (Alba and Hutchinson 2000), as consumers combine real and imaginary elements in producing cultural meaning and memory. That is, the inversions do not occur in the sense of a switch, but rather in the emphases consumers give to some imaginary or real elements over others, while maintaining both. Further, consumers do not make distinctions between the imaginary and the real in the same place. There is much variation, as some consumers give precedence to imaginary elements over activities that they observe at the show, while other consumers give precedence to show activities, discrediting elements of the imagined Old West. Thus, consumers’ distinctions between imagined and real show elements demonstrate collective and individual properties that vary within and across individual consumers.</p>
               <p>In taking a relational approach to consumers’ cultural production, I highlight four levels of negotiation in figure 9. The first level emphasizes the complex roles of consumer behavior. At the show consumers animate the Wild West, bringing it to life as a mythical and imagined, yet very real place in their dress, language, and interactions with other people and animals. Thus, such consumer animation goes beyond adjusting to a new retail location (Wallendorf, Lindsey‐Mullikin, and Pimentel 1998) to include producing cultural meanings and memories. Yet, this show is not the Old West, far from it. Missing in the gloss of this show is much of the contemporary reality of ranchers’ lives—the technical challenges of beef production, the dependence on the market, the difficulties of competing economically, and the obligations to family and community.</p>
               <p>Cultural meanings and memories are not only expressed in consumer behaviors; as importantly, consumption behaviors are the means through which consumers produce such cultural elements. That is, consumers produce cultural meanings and memories in animating a dialectic of imaginary and real components in their discourses and practices. Further, cultural meanings and memories are the means through which consumers experience and negotiate with market agents and offerings. In figure 9, cultural meanings and memories are depicted in the middle of the figure to represent their mediations between consumers and marketers. Specifically, consumers experience market agents and offerings in and through the cultural meanings and memories that consumers play an integral role in producing here at the show.</p>
               <p>The second level identifies personal, experiential, and historical influences on cultural production. Consumers’ production processes are influenced by their individual socio‐demographic characteristics, such as occupation, age, gender, and rural/urban and East/West residence; by experiential characteristics, including the purpose of the visit, companionship, and previous experience with western culture; and by familiarity with western history, including media representations, historical accounts, and family stories.</p>
               <p>Important at this level are the differences between the subject positions of ranch and nonranch visitors. At most show events, visitors are clearly marked as outsiders; they touch the animals, read the posters explaining the animals’ economic purposes, interact with the ranchers, and explain various aspects of ranch life to their children. In contrast, at the general interest merchandise booths, consumers are positioned as insiders. Strolling through the booths normalizes the otherwise exotic cultural event for visitors by placing them in known, comfortable consumer roles. In viewing, judging, selecting and purchasing—or not—merchandise in the Education Hall, consumers occupy subject positions similar to the ones they inhabit in shopping malls. Yet, consumers are implicated in this show as much more than outsiders. Although they resemble tourists of the beef industry at the show, it is their demand for meat that ultimately drives beef production. This sobering point remains just below the surface of the show spectacle, although it is most evident at the Safeway booth, where sides of beef are displayed with packages of meat.</p>
               <p>Further distinctions in the cultural production of ranch and nonranch consumers blur somewhat, although the imaginary components are skewed toward nonranch consumers since they lack direct experience and knowledge of ranch culture. Consumers watch the modern‐day cowboys against implicit and explicit backdrops of John Wayne movies and Louis L’Amour novels. In short, they bring the whole mythic‐historical aura of the West into play—literally in the rodeo and figuratively in their make‐believe antics and the many popular cultural references to the Old West that they bring to the show. Yet, elements of the imaginary and real West are just as important to ranchers staying in the industry, as evident in their testimony emphasizing naturalism, their faith in the market, and their beliefs in freedom and community and family cohesion (Peñaloza 2000).</p>
               <p>The third level highlights the interactions—and lack thereof—between various subgroups. The bringing together of visitors and ranchers is central to the cultural functioning of the stock show, with additional distinctions between those from the West and outside it, men and women, adults and children, whites and nonwhites, and humans and animals, as previously discussed.</p>
               <p>For visitors, a fun‐filled afternoon of stock shows, booths, and rodeo is a temporarily shortened and idealized form of the more gradual socialization ranchers undergo and transmit over periods of several years. The Ranchland and Safeway exhibits, in particular, mark key points of convergence and divergence for visitors and ranchers in negotiating western imaginary and real realms. For adults, Ranchland is somehow comforting, if only for a brief respite from the rest of the show. For visitor Marilyn Jones, knowing where our food comes from simply is not fun for most consumers; it is much more fun to relate to the animals as overgrown pets or wild beasts to tame. Petting the animals alongside the children brings adults in, too, and in helping their children through the show, they redirect attention to celebrating the West and the animals, and away from the specialized efficiency of beef production and meat processing.</p>
               <p>For ranchers, the show is fundamentally business—buying, selling, and promoting cattle—and it is these activities that attract visitors here to consume the West. In ways similar to Goffman’s front stage, beef producers—ranchers and marketers—give consumers a view of how they want their industry to be seen. Yet, for consumers/visitors who are interested in probing the industry beyond its Wild West elements, its inner workings are accessible in the sales and shows and in ranchers' activities and testimony.</p>
               <p>There are separate shows for consumers and ranchers—as exemplified in self‐selected activities, experiences, and perspectives on events—although the two groups overlap. Consumers’ activities are concentrated as visitors at Ranchland and at the animal pens, sales, and shows; spectators at the rodeo and stadium entertainment; and shoppers in the merchandise booths. Ranchers’ activities are concentrated as workers in the animal pens, shows, and sales; shoppers at the merchandise booths; and spectators at the rodeo and other performances. When consumers and ranchers do get together, they play different roles at the animal pens, shows, and sales; and similar roles at entertainment events, such as the rodeo and other entertainment, and at the merchandise booths. Thus, consumers most often see ranchers engaged in beef marketing or off duty, and not engaged in potentially more disturbing beef production activities.</p>
               <p>These separations and overlaps are important in understanding the roles of visitors’ relations with ranchers and booth exhibitors in producing western cultural meaning and memory here. Significantly, visitors tend to subordinate their roles as beef consumers at the show, instead emphasizing a mix of nostalgia for the Old West and marvel at ranchers' high‐tech animal domestication and reproduction technologies. Conversely, ranchers point to consumers as the primary force in bringing about the animal industries as we know them, while downplaying their desires to play cowboy.</p>
               <p>The fourth level captures the market interactions of consumers with marketers, producers, and industry. First, there are sponsored activities and promotions everywhere. Marketing is so common here as to be the guiding principle for the show. As such, the show is in sync with larger social trends regarding marketing as a predominant cultural activity and institution of our time (Firat and Venkatesh 1995). Further, in consuming this trade show, consumers play important roles in relation to beef producers and the beef industry. Manifest as entertainment, consuming the show carries out socialization roles for consumers via an intricate mix of economic and cultural activities. Industry practices are a primary source of the show’s authenticity for consumers, as the presence of ranchers and their animals is an important marker of the West. Conversely, in consuming the show, consumers constitute an important social legitimacy for the industry.</p>
               <p>That the activities and narratives here are skewed in favor of the beef industry is to be expected of a trade show. Indeed, the beef industry takes an active cultural role here in the selective provision of information by producers and production associations and in the manner that industry participants go about their business. Another part of the way in which this happens is in the show’s emphasis on small, independent ranchers over large agribusinesses and in nostalgic portrayals of the rural West. Yet, while consumers produce cultural meanings here that align with the interests of marketers, beef producers, and the beef industry, such cultural production goes beyond the interests of the market agents. While some aspects of raising cattle, such as living in close harmony with nature and the wild independence of the cowboys, are attractive and appealing to consumers in contrast with their own lives, other aspects, such as the use of hormones and mass production at the feed lots and slaughterhouses, are less so. Ultimately, consumers’ cultural production of the West both supports and indicts beef producers and production.</p>

         <title>Implications</title>
         <sec id="sc5.1">
            <title>Consumers’ Active but Constrained Cultural Production</title>
            <p>Consumers exhibit tremendous agency in producing culture at the stock show. As strollers and spectators, consumers actively engage in meaning‐ and memory‐making in this marketplace. But while consumers playfully produce culture in juxtaposing elements of market reality with elements of the western imaginary, such production processes demonstrate a disjointed structure and are constrained by the interests of beef marketers and producers. Further, while consumers' cultural production provides an important social legitimization for industry, this, too, is incomplete. The production of proindustry cultural meanings is resisted by those consumers who refuse to attend the show. For those who attend, their acquiescence to the industry is partial, as they go to the show on their own terms, providing their own narratives of entertainment by accepting some industry information while counterarguing and rejecting other information.</p>
            <p>The gaps and contradictions in consumers’ cultural production provide an important site of analysis as noted early on by Marx ([1859] 1904) and later by members of the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer and Adorno 1986; Marcuse 1969) and contemporary cultural theorists (Zižek 1994). However, while their term “false consciousness” addresses the way in which consumers eclipse some elements of meaning over others, this work highlights the way in which consumers combine contradictory elements in disjointed ways in producing cultural meanings and memories in and through their marketplace relations.</p>
            <p>By examining the intricate, contradictory structuring of consumers’ cultural production, we are better able to understand the workings of the contemporary marketplace. It is particularly important to consider industry constraints on consumers' productions of cultural meaning and memory. This stock show is a private space, controlled and regulated by members of the beef industry to include only proindustry activities and materials. At the same time, consumers exert constraints on the industry here, in the sense that show practices and discourses ultimately must be acceptable to them.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="sc5.2">
            <title>Cultural Production as Market Mediation</title>
            <p>It was important in the early growth of the field of consumer behavior to move beyond the reductive study of consumers from the perspective of marketers (Belk 1984; Tucker 1974). Yet, in carving out the study of consumer behavior as a separate field of inquiry independent of marketing activities, consumer researchers may be losing sight of the ways in which consumers and marketers negotiate cultural meanings in relation to each other in the marketplace. The many contrasts and overlaps between consumer cultures and market cultures here create a prime setting for exploring the mediating roles of cultural meanings for consumers in relation to market agents and institutions.</p>
            <p>Consumer behavior is an important means of cultural knowledge. Through the cultural meanings and memories they produce here, consumers mediate their sense of market agents and institutions, with contradictory sentiments being an important factor in their inversion of romanticized western cultural meanings over meanings related to meat production. It is significant that so many visitors want to see and touch animals and to watch them ridden and roped in rodeos, but are uncomfortable with both the idea of killing them for food and their own roles as meat consumers. The preservation of the Wild West is important in making possible consumers’ continued participation at this show. The struggle for survival recreated at the rodeo and other entertainments provides a more suitable alibi for consumers otherwise engaged in pleasurably touring the rational apparatus of meat production at the shows, sales, and booth exhibits.</p>
            <p>In asserting a formative place for production in consumer culture, this research implements the postmodern refusal to split consumption from production (Firat and Venkatesh 1995). Yet, while the postmodern paradigm has made advances by drawing attention to the ways that consumers produce and marketers consume, it has a tendency to perpetuate modernist limitations in obscuring the cultural workings of producers. In examining consumers’ cultural production, it is important to look at how consumers experience production activities and industry as well.</p>
            <p>There is irony in the ways that consumers produce western culture at this show, and in countless restaurants, films, and theme parks, as their activities bring other very real economic ups and downs to ranchers (Berry 1977; Russell 1993). Despite recent increases in annual beef consumption to 66.2 lbs. per person, this figure is well below its peak of 78.3 lbs. in 1983 (Day 1994; Raabe 2000).9 Further, urban and suburban growth and development bring about the very New West that many consumers strive to leave behind in coming to this show. Thus, it appears that the more consumers’ daily lives depart from traditional western meanings and memories, the more they value the recreation of these meanings in market spectacles, with the market serving as an important arena that both drives social change and works through it. By examining the intricate relations among consumers, marketers, and producers that underlie long‐standing market traditions, we are better able to understand the complex and contradictory effects of consumers' cultural production.</p>

                  <p>Several factors account for these decreases and increases in U.S. beef consumption. Traditional meanings accorded to beef consumption, including social status, vitality, masculinity, and heterosexuality, began to lessen somewhat in the 1970s (Heinz and Lee 1998), as the environmental (Wilson 1992), animal rights (Singer 1990), and feminist (Adams 1990) movements popularized grain‐ and vegetable‐based diets through the 1980s and 1990s. Recent increases are attributed to economic growth and consumer indifference to health concerns (Raabe 2000). Even so, U.S. beef consumption remains high relative to most other countries; by 1997 per capita annual beef consumption in pounds totaled 26.8 in Japan, 46.9 in Brazil, and 84.9 in Australia (U.S. Department of Agriculture 1997).</p>

            <title>Consuming Another Culture</title>
            <p>The final contribution of this work is its attention to the consumption of another culture as a fundamental, contemporary market phenomenon. Consumers’ production of western culture is intriguing, as it involves a business and subculture with a way of life, language, and aesthetic that all cut to the core of Americana. The significance of such production lies as much in the ways that it cuts across the temporal present and past, as in the way that it cuts across relations between and within social groups.</p>
            <p>A major source of theoretical insight regarding cultural interaction comes from anthropology. Ethnographers have documented how our cultural experience and knowledge is inevitably and intricately interwoven into our experiences with other cultures (Clifford and Marcus 1986). Part of the reason western culture captures consumers’ imagination so artfully is that it is in contrast to their everyday lives. In making western cultural meanings and memories, consumers both draw from and reinterpret rural white subculture via their projections of present and past hopes for what they do not have and want, and of fears of what they do have and do not like.</p>
            <p>Consumers' cultural production in consuming the artifacts and experiences of another culture raises questions regarding the relative contributions of their own and the other culture. Issues of cultural ownership and appropriation by consumers and marketers are important, as are the related issues of market and social power—being able to stake one's cultural claims and disavow those of others.</p>
            <p>The degree to which consumers have knowledge of the other culture and whether they are provided such cultural knowledge by marketers are also important. The more consumers lack such knowledge, the more they may employ their own cultural references and those provided in the marketplace. Marketers, in turn, have much leeway in providing consumers with cultural references, which at times serve as a source of cultural authenticity and which at other times may become obstacles to consumers' provision of their own cultural references. The point is not that marketers are historically inaccurate; in no way should ranchers or trade shows be expected to reflect historical or contemporary demographics and social relations. As providers of culture, marketers are only partially cast in the role of social arbiter. The more telling issue is that consumers rely on the market for cultural and history lessons.</p>
            <p>At the show ranchers provide their culture for consumption by those who have (ranchers) and those who do not have (nonranchers) cultural knowledge. Notably, the presence of ranchers lends cultural authenticity to the show for nonranch consumers, with ranchers and the descendants of ranchers working to carry on the integrity of past cultural traditions. However, consumers are somewhat autonomous in carving out their own cultural meanings and memories, and visitors coming here to reconnect with nature says much about our society’s alienation from it. Animating western culture is one way of recuperating aspects of the rural life that have been lost as American society has modernized. The West, with its romanticized naturalism, market autonomy, freedom, and community, is the antithesis of contemporary life in the urban United States—East and West.</p>
            <p>There is an additional sense in which this research sheds light on the consumption of another culture. In examining how white rural culture is consumed at this show, this research adds to work on dominant cultural forms (Lipsitz 1998). Specifically, this research suggests that white rural culture plays important roles within the larger configurations of white culture and U.S. culture, as consumed by members and nonmembers in negotiating elements of the imaginary and the real. In their position as the mainstream, whites are absent in most cultural studies of consumer behavior, as researchers tend to focus on nonwhite cultural forms. Documenting the consumption of white culture is an important contribution to our understanding of how it maintains its very powerful but implicit position at the center of U.S. culture.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>Because it combines business activities with consumer entertainment, the trade show is an invaluable venue for studying contemporary consumers’ cultural production. Consumers negotiate western cultural meanings signifying naturalism, competition, freedom and independence, and family and community cohesion in concert with, and against, proindustry exhibits and information. In turn, business activities and references to the Old West are significant for consumers in giving the show authenticity. In blending elements of the historical past, the Wild West imaginary, and sophisticated meat production selectively, consumers negotiate past and present cultural relations.</p>
         <p>In examining consumers’ cultural production at the trade show, this work raises issues regarding relations between consumers and industry interests. Suggestions for further research include the consumption of other animal shows, such as the Houston and Kansas City stock shows, as well as horse and pet shows, for regional variations in history and content, and for the theoretical insights such studies generate into consumer behavior. Further work at other trade shows, such as the COMDEX computer show, automobile shows, house and garden shows, and expositions for New Age and <italic>Star Trek</italic> fans held internationally and domestically, potentially offers insight into their roles in casting regional and national cultural meanings and building global consumer culture.</p>
         <p>Finally, further research is called for regarding the many market avenues for consuming other cultures. Buying and selling the artifacts and activities of other cultures in tourism, film, museum visits, music, restaurants, clothing, automobiles, and home furnishings, to name a few, is arguably the single most prevalent consumption phenomenon in the world today. Such further work could examine variations in the cultural knowledge of consumers and in the provision and absence of such knowledge by marketers. Of particular interest is whether marketers’ omissions of cultural references facilitate consumers’ projections of their own cultural references on the artifacts and experiences of other cultures. Mapping out the nuances of ownership and the use of cultural artifacts by member and nonmember consumers and marketers would also make important contributions. By bridging sociotemporal and disciplinary divides separating consumers from marketers and producers, we gain insight into the particular roles of each, as well as the ways that they together constitute the multicultural world, as consumption emerges as an increasingly powerful culturally productive force.</p>
