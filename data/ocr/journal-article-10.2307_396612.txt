<plain_text><page sequence="1">METZ, CHRISTIAN. L'Enonciation impersonnelle ou le site du film. Paris: Meridiens Klinck- sieck, 1991. Pp. 228. At the end of this dense study that compares theories of enunciation to film, the author concludes that "l'6nonciation filmique est impersonnelle, textuelle, m&amp;tadiscursive, et qu'elle commente ou r'flkchit, selon le cas, son propre enonce" (210). Which means: in cinema, Emile Benveniste's law of communication, where acts of speech imply human subjects in the form of shifters (I, you, he, she, they), does not hold true. Film subverts deixis, the process of exchange that locates subjects and their positions in language and space. Enunciation exists only partially in cinema because the receiver (l'hnonciataire) is not in dialogue with any localizable or subjective other. Film collapses anthropomorphic paradigms of communication. Montage, a complex process that diversely concatenates visual and aural material, creates an often unknown and imponderable mixture of signs that "evolves in its own place" (203). Metz works toward these conclusions in three movements. In part I, "L'6nonication anthropoide" (9-36), he reviews classical treatments of enunciation and their application in film theory. To obtain a more objective model, Metz replaces "interlocutor," "sender," or "receiver" with foyer and cible, and instance d'incarnation to describe the function allocated to shifters when seen in film. Metz loosens traditionally fixed points that equate emission and reception of informa- tion with human exchange. With the new terminology we can follow more poly- valent "directions inside the geography of film" (34). In part II, "Sur quelques paysages d'6nonciations (visite guid&amp;e)" (39-172), the author constructs a mobile topography of effects that film exploits to draw atten- tion to its "metadiscursive" process. Among others, these include figures address- ing the spectator as if they were the camera; voice-off or uncanny sounds that cannot be located on the image-track; mirrors that splinter filmic space; self- conscious presence of the filmic apparatus in the narrative; frames within frames; films within films, including transverse characters, flash-backs, recording devices, and entire remakes; attention to point of view that underscores who and what sees or speaks in relation to narration; voice-over that impugns illusion of transparent chronicle; transitions (fades, dissolves, wipes) that accentuate the presence of the foyer enunciatif; tensions of "style" as both signature of an auteur and an impersonal mark of enunciation; absence of any "neutral" images in film in general. Part III, "Quatre pas dans les nuages (envolke theorique)," responds to different critics who work in the same area (Genette et al.) and see film as a text multiply creased along complex ridges of a surface of enunciation. In his earlier writings Metz sought to define cinema through principles of lin- guistics. Discovering that the "shot" ultimately shares little analogy with either words or morphemes and phonemes, he then compared cinema to psychoanalysis. Like Langage et cinema (1971) and Le Signifiant imaginaire (1977), L'Enonciation imper- sonnelle is an essay built upon an analogy destined to fail. It studies the basic linguistics of subjectivity in a medium whose controlling strategies, as Walter Benjamin stated in the 1930s, aim at constructing the imaginary lives of its public.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 549 Metz arrives at the threshold of an effective tactic by which analysis shows how media fabricate illusions of communication. Metz refuses to project his work beyond the confines of formalism. The findings are enclosed within a circle of appointed colleagues and specialists with whom he dialogues at length. A human presence returns, as if it were something repressed, in the space of an implied seminar. Thus an aura of defensive narcissism prevails as the book plods by moving from concept to example and summary to rejoinder. Where Metz calls in question the force of enunciation in cinema, he embodies the concept in his style and, like the many formalists cited, he fails to implement his hypotheses in the art of writing. The form of the book is fixed at the antipodes of its conclusions. By different means the author arrives at findings identical to those of Derrida on kcriture and speech-act theory (1967 and 1972), that long ago sug- gested how impersonal enunciation in cinema is identical to that of writing in general. The aim to find general laws is framed by the author's avowed history that fixes the Liberation (1946) and the advent of formalism (circa 1968) as stages in his intellectual journey. But patient and generous readers will welcome the book. Metz coins voix-je to generalize "voice-off" in a way that recalls Bakhtine's dialogic principle. He hints that ideology is produced from "subjective images lacking subjects" (130), and notes that contemporary film brutalizes meta-filmic forms with the violence of une machine A secouer le monde, comme il existe dans les foires" (132). Metz remarks that "weakened deixis," a concept meaningless for linguists, is crucial for any grasp of cinema. Appealing to figures of folds and mobile geography, Metz unconsciously shares affinities with the work of Gilles Deleuze and the late F61ix Guattari. In the sequel that he promises Metz would do well to explore those affinities. This is an annoying but rich and rewarding study. University of Minnesota Tom Conley</page></plain_text>
