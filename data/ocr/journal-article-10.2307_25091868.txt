<plain_text><page sequence="1">CM. Mayo Lay Thine Hand Upon Him Lay thine hand upon him ?Job 41:8 UPan ingnacio is a whale watchers' paradise," purred the O copy for the Baja Expeditions five-day tour that appeared in my Mexico City mailbox. "Our'safari-styled' camp is awaiting your arrival." In the photo a skiff-load of tourists in candy-colored life jackets was reaching out their hands to pet the muzzle? humongous, glistening gray cone?of a whale. Here was an example, as a Mexican friend wryly put it, of el ecoturismo industrial en su m?xima expresi?n. In other words: the Cadillac of ecotourism. I had long wanted to visit Laguna San Ignacio, one of the most remote bays on Baja California's Pacific coast, and the n?mero uno place on earth to watch gray whales. I wasn't so much interested in the whales, however, as I was in their watchers?the eco tourists. I was in the midst of traveling the length of the nearly one-thousand-mile-long peninsula, trip by trip, and writing about what I found. A narrow land of stunning yet egg-shell fragile beauty, large swaths of Baja California are being over grazed by goats and cattle, its aquifers running down, its waters polluted and over-fished. Almost everyone I'd talked to?ranchers, marine biologists, fishing fleet owners, artists, environmental activists?told me they hoped to see more ecotourism. But what was this new-fangled class of tour like? Who were the people who went on these ecotours, and did their attitudes change as a result?And what about the people for whom ecotourism was a job? If ecotourism was to play a role in the salvation of Baja California's endangered ecosystem, it seemed to me that these were questions worth exploring. And here, if I were willing to burn a deep hole in my bank account, was my chance. 359</page><page sequence="2">The Massachusetts Review A few weeks later, I found myself having landed on a dirt air strip midway down the peninsula's Pacific coast and, along with twenty other ecotourists, hanging onto my seat as we jounced in the Baja Expeditions' school bus down a washboard road toward Laguna San Ignacio. This was the western edge of the Vizcaino Desert, a vast flatness of sandy ground encrusted with shells. There were no cactuses here, only low scrubby bushes and skele tal ocotillo not yet in bloom. The afternoon sky was light and scraped with thin licks of salt-white clouds. In the distance a coyote bounded away, kicking up scuffs of sand. Chris Peterson, one of our two naturalists, had to shout to make himself heard over the roar and rattle of the bus. Fortyish with a clean-shaven face, Chris wore a Day-Glo pink and orange anorak with purple sleeves, and a baseball cap that said "WILD AMERICA." "Everybody has their own technique for finding whales," Chris shouted. "Some people tap their foot against the bottom of the boat. Some people sing, Here, kitty kittyV With that, the bus kiltered into a pothole, and I had to grab the seat in front of me to keep from bouncing into the aisle. Slowly, gears screeching like a wounded animal, the bus hauled itself forward and, as if nothing had happened, Chris resumed. "One lady finds whales by standing at the front of the boat and singing 'Amazing Grace.'" Laying his hand on his chest, our guide dropped his jaw to sing "Ama-a-a-a-a-a-a-zing gr-a-a-a a-a?Ah!" He pointed out the window to an imaginary whale. "Ah, ah!" We were driving across a muddy depression now, nude of any vegetation.The road had become an uncertain trace of tire tracks, filled in here and there with puddles of saltwater sparkling in the sunshine. A flock of sanderlings flew low to the ground beside us, flashing their white bellies as they flittered back and forth. "By the time you leave," Chris boomed with a radiant author ity, "all of you will have your own technique." I hadn't known anything about these whale-finding techniques, 360</page><page sequence="3">Lay Thine Hand Upon Him but I had done a bit of research. The adult gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), a medium-size baleen cetacean with a mottled, shoe leather gray appearance, ranges from thirty-nine and a half to forty-six feet from nose to fluke tips, that is, the length of a four story building laid on its side, and may weigh anywhere from fif teen to thirty-five tons. Summers they spend feeding in the plankton-rich Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas; in early January, after a migration of some five-thousand miles?the longest of any mammal?they begin arriving in Baja California, where in the warm, shallow waters of the peninsula's inner Pacific bays, cows give birth to their ten-foot-long half-ton calves. Their three main calving grounds are Bah?a Magdalena, Laguna San Ignacio, and Laguna Ojo de Liebre (Scammons Lagoon); of the three, Laguna San Ignacio is the true mecca for the modern whale watcher, because there the gray whales will swim right up to the skiffs and allow the whale watchers to touch them. In the past, however, whales were considered extremely dan gerous. When one Yankee whaler first attempted to hunt the grays in Baja California, they destroyed two of his catcher boats and staved the others fifteen times. Of the eighteen men he'd sent out, six were seriously injured, one with both legs broken. Nearly a century later, the few Americans who ventured down in airplanes and jeeps found the recovered population of "devil fish" as devilish as ever. When a researcher tried to attach a wire to a basking gray to record its heartbeat, with a single slap of its flukes, the whale smashed the rudder, knocked off the propeller, and bent the drive shaft at a forty-five degree angle. Then, hav ing swum away a short distance, it charged again and smashed in the hull. When Erie Stanley Gardner, the intrepid traveler and detec tive novelist of Perry Mason fame, visited in the early 1960s, he thus had good reason to caption one of his grainy photos of a gray whale, "In Dangerous Proximity." But Gardner's was a mild, even amusing encounter: a lost calf nosed up underneath one of the skiffs, letting it slip off his back. Not long after, Jon Lindbergh, swimming in a wetsuit, found himself being butted 361</page><page sequence="4">The Massachusetts Review by a playful calf. Something was changing: was it the whales, or the people? By the early 1980s encounters with "friendlies" had become an almost daily occurrence during the calving season in Laguna San Ignacio. And U.S. tour companies like Baja Expe ditions were Johnnys-on-the-spot, marketing trips that featured the chance to pet the friendlies from a skiff. The sun hung low over the Pacific when our bus, casting a long shadow, finally ground to a halt up on a slight rise over the southern shore of the lagoon. We clambered down onto the sandy ground. Scattered over about an acre stood a dozen gray dome-shaped tents and two nearly house-size regulation-green army tents: our "safari-styled" camp. The sky had paled and was nearly white at the horizon, but Laguna San Ignacio was so blue it looked like one great brush stroke of Joan Mir? cerulean. A ragged file of pelicans headed inland, silhouetted against the peaks of the Sierra de Santa Clara that rose beyond the far shore. And the whales? "Where are you whales?"This was Lisa, a middle-aged blonde who wore wooden earrings with oreas painted on them that bobbled in the breeze.1 "Oh, I'm just dyin' to touch a whale!" "Here, kitty kitty," someone joked. All we saw was water. A flock of cormorants. "Look!" Lisa giggled as a pair of heart-shaped sprays burst up from the middle of the lagoon, perhaps a mile away. Like a good shepherd, Chris was with us. "You can actually hear them breathing when it's calm." We stood for a while, all twenty of us, watching the enormous landscape. It was extraordinary, the thought that such creatures would let us touch them. But it was even more extraordinary, I thought, that we would want to. We were fed, introduced to the smiling staff, given a tour of the camp, and shown to our tents.This was all done with such smooth efficiency that I couldn't help feeling we were being shunted 362</page><page sequence="5">Lay Thine Hand Upon Him along on a conveyor belt, as at Disneyland, ever closer.. .To touch a whale, writes Roger Payne in Among Whales, "It's the kind of experience that can change one's life." Marvels Michelle Gilders in Refections of a Whale Watcher," Ask me to describe the emotions of the experience and I cannot. Ask me to say how I felt during the encounter, and I can only smile and laugh at remembering the episode. How does it feel to be in love? Sheer elation." Sheer elation? An experience that might change my life? When we regrouped in front of the mess tent, the stars had begun to come out, impossibly close. In what seemed like a mat ter of minutes the Milky Way ribboned above us in a sparkling canopy. There appeared only a sliver of a moon, but it was bright enough to cast our shadows on the sand. Chris was holding a plastic model of a gray whale, showing us how it "spyhops," resting its flukes on the lagoon's muddy bottom as it raises its head straight up out of the water. A little girl named Holly trained her flashlight on it so we could see. "We are too anthropomorphic," Chris was saying. "We say the whales 'spyhop,' but why should we think they want to look at us? If you watch closely you'll see that most of the time when whales do this, their eyes don't even come out of the water." I couldn't help thinking, as Chris arced the plastic whale over his other hand, that he would have made a wonderful kinder garten teacher. He went on, "This is what dolphins do,'bowing,' or 'porpoising,' as if they're going through a hoop. But whales 'breach.' They thrust up?" he showed us with the toy?"they twist around and crash back on their sides onto the water. Whales also show their tails when they dive, but not so much here because the lagoon is shallow. If they tried to dive like that here?" he smashed its nose into his palm?"they'd hit their heads." "Ow," Holly winced. In the mess tent we were served a supper of tuna casserole, then given more instruction. Glenn Neumann, the deeply tanned and ponytailed Baja Expeditions base camp director, led this session. For nights, he handed out lanterns; for whale watching, wading boots and, as featured in the brochure, candy-colored life jackets. 363</page><page sequence="6">The Massachusetts Review Mine was cherry-red. As we tried them on, someone joked that it was like wearing the cushions of his sofa. Little Holly wanted to know: How do you touch a whale? "That's a good question," Glenn said in his beautiful voice, deep and mellow as melted caramel. "I'm glad you asked that." Not around the eyes, he explained, the blow hole, or the flippers. "Their flippers are really powerful, and they could slap you up the side of your head. Some whales like to have their baleen stroked. When you pat them, you can rub really hard. These guys are huge! And we are really small. So rub away!" Holly gripped the edge of her plastic chair and bit her Up. Suddenly the only sound was a faint whap whup of the wind against the canvas of the tent. The lantern swayed slightly from its pole. "I know," Glenn said with a fatherly chuckle. "Everybody's dyin' to touch the whales! But I have to stress that I hope you won't be disappointed if you don't actually touch one." "Gotta cover themselves," muttered one man to his wife. Lisa nodded, bobbling her little wooden orea earrings. All through the night the frame of my little dome of a tent creaked in the wind and gusts of numbingly cold air whistled through the cracks between the panels. I slept fitfully, with the sleeping bag pulled over my head. Near dawn I woke to the sound of the tent's entrance flap slapping loose against the ground. I found my sleeping bag sodden with dew. I reached my bare toes into the chill for my sneakers: they too were sodden. I shuffled, miserably, out into the fog. In the army-green womb of the mess tent I poured myself a mug of steaming-hot coffee. I sat at the table, cupping its warmth in my hands. Breakfast was hearty, a thick eggy cake with Mexican pastries and fruit salad. Lisa sat with me. In a moment, another middle-aged woman named Brenda joined us. Brenda had a grandmotherly, apple-cheeked face. A lace-edged, pink flowered flannel nightgown peeked out from beneath her rain coat. When she sat down, the nightgown's hem dragged on the 364</page><page sequence="7">Lay Thine Hand Upon Him sandy ground. Her friend, who wore a helmet of permed yellow hair and designer glasses, was named Rennie. Divorc?es from Los Angeles, Brenda and Rennie traveled together. "Our kids are all grown up now," Brenda said. "Last year we went to China," Rennie said. "It's better to travel," Lisa said. "Why leave your money to your kids?" "Yeah," said Brenda. "That's what I tell my dad," Lisa said. "I don't want your money, Dad. Take a trip. Enjoy life." Rennie said, "He's got some problems with walking, but I'm going to book my dad on a Princess cruise to Scandinavia. It goes to Norway, Sweden, and... what's that other one there?" "Finland?" I suggested. "Yeah. Then it goes on up to Russia and you get a tour of St. Petersburg." Lisa wrinkled her nose. "Oh, but St. Petersburg, the crime?" Brenda said, "The food in Russia is terrible. It's just rotten onions and cabbage, and God-knows-what they put in the sausage." Holly's dad, Hal, joined us. Hal was an orthopedic surgeon with a strong-jawed and fleshy face not unlike the young Teddy Roosevelt's. A better trip, Hal informed us, would be to go to the Galapagos. "You do two islands a day.You get to stay in these lit tle cabins, and they all have hot water." "Hot water?" Lisa said. "Lord. I don't know how I'm going to manage without hot water." "Me neither," said Brenda, and she drew the lapels of her rain coat tight at the throat and shivered. By ten o'clock the sun had burned through the fog. In all my whale-watching gear, I felt like a clown: over my clothes, I had on a lemon-yellow rain poncho, the cherry-red life jacket, a ban danna, a baseball cap, and sunglasses; over my shoes, enormous rubber wading boots; and swinging around my neck, a camera, binoculars, and a canteen. "Laguna San Ignacio!" Chris yelled as he hugged himself tight. "It's SO GOOD to be back!" And we were off, the spray flying in our faces. At last, we were 365</page><page sequence="8">The Massachusetts Review heading out toward the mouth of the lagoon, to the Designated Whale Watching Area. There were eight of us in this panga, as they called the skiffs, plus the Mexican driver. Everyone was smiling wide, clutching their cameras and video cameras beneath their rain ponchos as we sped over water dancing with sun. Behind, we could see the the tallest volcanic cone of the Tres Virgenes, clear on the other side of the peninsula. Ahead of us, a flock of cormorants flew in a wedge, onyx-black against the jewel-blue of the sky. At the horizon, a whale was breaching, hurling out waves of silver as it crashed down again and again. Lisa splayed her hand out into the wind, as if for practice. We passed several pairs of cows with their calves. The calves were smooth and dark, unlike their mothers, who were blotched with barnacles and whale lice. The cows swam close to their calves. When they surfaced, they spurted tandem heart-shaped blows ofmist, one big and one?just a piff-?very small. "We've got to get farther out," Chris shouted. "We want to find more single adults because the calves are newborns and the cows are going to be too protective."This was only the last week in January, the first of the tour season. We'd gone two or three miles from camp when the driver slowed the engine to a burble. All of a sudden, not ten feet from the prow, a massive snout rose up out of the water straight as an obelisk, twenty feet high. Covered with barnacles and clumps of lice that looked a gelatinous pink in the sunlight, thick rivulets of water rushed down; the skin glistened. The line of the whale's mouth curved slightly, as if in a rueful smile, and the baseball-size eye, only inches above the water, swiveled in its socket. Then the whale turned, slowly, and opened its jaws, revealing a comb of flax-yellow baleen. It stayed like this for perhaps thirty seconds. Then, noiselessly, it slipped back down into the lagoon. So this was "spyhopping." I'd been too stunned to take a pho tograph. How had the driver known to stop here? "You look for the fluke prints," Chris said, "a circle of what looks like grease floating on the water. The fluke prints don't tell you where the whale is, but they tell you where the whale was. 366</page><page sequence="9">Lay Thine Hand Upon Him Then you can guess where it might come up." We waited for a while to see if another whale would surface. About a quarter mile to our left, two other Baja Expeditions pan gas had found what looked like a friendly. The hump of its back filled the space between the boats, and the people were leaning out, tipping the gunwales dangerously close to the water as they tried to touch it. Lisa raised her binoculars for a better look. "I'm so jealous," Rennie sighed. "Two pangas to a whale, that's the rule," Chris said. "We can't go over there?" Brenda said. "No." Chris chuckled. "And you'll see, you'll get very posses sive about your whales." After another ten minutes, a cow and her calf approached our panga. Chris plashed the water with his hand. "Here, kitty kitty!' Rennie and Lisa leaned out and plashed the water too. "Try this," Chris said, tapping his foot dup-dup-dup against the floor of the boat. But rather than come closer, the cow settled just beneath the hull. She was big and dark as a submarine, and we could see her splotchy white barnacles through the jade-green water. "She's so close," Lisa said, clenching her fists. The calf poked its nose out of the water, tantalizingly near. "Oh!" Rennie reached out, her hand like a fat white star. "Oh, oh, oh!" The cow surfaced and blew. The wind carried the mist away from us, and the sunlight shining through it prismed into a rainbow. Back in camp, we compared notes. None of us had had the luck to touch a whale, although in three hours of whale watch ing, we'd all had at least a dozen close encounters. The big news at lunch was that the panga with the Carpenter family?Jim, Joanne and their two boys?had filmed a live birth. "The cow was lifting her tail and slamming it down and lift ing it up," Joanne said. "We couldn't figure it out, it looked so strange." Jim said, "And then suddenly, there was all this blood on the 367</page><page sequence="10">The Massachusetts Review water and out it came, a little calf1." Spirits were high when we hiked back down to the pangas for our afternoon whale-watching session. Along with Chris, I switched pangas to go with the Carpenters. I told Jim, "My tech nique for finding whales is to go with you guys." He patted his video camera, a Sony as big as a shoebox, and grinned. But again the whales proved shy. We would see a blow or a flipper, motor up close, and then the whale would dive away. We seemed to be going in circles around the Designated Whale Watching Area. After a while, Jim left his video camera on his lap with the lens cap on. It was torture sitting in the afternoon sun in all this rubber gear, the boots, the rain ponchos. The life jacket felt bulky and hot as being sandwiched between two boards. We'd seen what there was to see, the birds, the sandy shore, the mountains bleached pale in the distance. Sometime around four o'clock, another Baja Expeditions panga motored by. Little Holly was lying prostrate across the bow in an agony of boredom. We'd motored up to yet another whale that swam away from us when Chris seemed to come out of suspended animation. "Look at that!" Hadn't we noticed its flukes, crisscrossed with deep white scars? "Those are orea bites. Oreas hunt in pods, and they'll hunt grays. One takes a flipper, one takes a fluke, and then?" He had our full attention. "One goes in and bites out the tongue!" "Oooooh," Johnny Carpenter said. A skinny-armed thirteen year old, he wore a sports watch that bristled with dials. Chris said, "There was a gray whale that came here for several years that had no flukes on his tail. They were all bitten off by oreas." "Oooooh," Johnny said again. This seemed to please him immensely. "There are two things in the ocean," Chris said. "Oreas and orea food." Now that we were on the subject of food, was it true that the Japanese ate whale meat? 368</page><page sequence="11">Lay Thine Hand Upon Him "Oh, yes," Chris said brightly. He'd been a Mormon mission ary in Japan. "I ate whale meat when I was there. You can buy it in the supermarket." What was it like? "Purply red, like beef except that it's got these huge blood vessels?" he made a circle with his hands. "When you cook it, it falls apart like fish." "I ate whale meat once," Joanne Carpenter volunteered. She was sitting in front of us and she swiveled around to join the conversation. A handsome woman with cropped champagne blonde hair, she wore gold button earrings and a touch of pink lipstick. "I didn't really want to eat it, though. We were in Japan. Jim was there on business, and I didn't want to offend our hosts. They kept saying please, please, try some." She laughed nervously. "It was three chunks of sushi arranged on a plate with three dif ferent sauces." "Remember the zebra steak we ate in Africa?" Jim grinned at his wife. "Oh, yes, that was really good." "That was great! Barbecued." It was a sad score: No one had touched a whale in the after noon either. At dinner, as we lined up in the mess tent to serve ourselves from an iron pot of fish stew, we were sullen, like pas sengers on an overseas flight wedged into tourist class, with hours yet to go. I sat off by myself at the far corner of the table. "Do you like it?" This was Alejandro, one of the cooks. He meant the fish stew. It was wonderful, I said, and I meant it. Chunks of tender flounder were tossed with chopped fresh tomatoes, onion, sprigs of or?gano, and a delicate lacing of garlic. I'd made a taco with a floury grilled tortilla. He had a beard, but it seemed to me that Alejandro was very young. He was wearing a T-shirt with whales on it. So he liked whales? 369</page><page sequence="12">The Massachusetts Review "I love the whales! I can't wait to go out!" Alejandro seemed to rocket around in his chair with enthusiasm. "I get to have a turn when there's room on the boat. I made a video of the whales," ?he was breathless with happiness?"and I sent it to be edited, and I sold it for twenty-five dollars." We stopped talking because Chris had started his slide show. It was an expert slide slow, zippy and informative. In a little less than an hour, he'd covered the feeding and mating habits of the whales, what we know and what we don't know. Finally, why was it that some of the grays allowed people to touch them? Apparently because grays like to rub, perhaps to remove barna cles and lice. "The whales probably don't even know that we're human," Chris said. "They see our boat and they probably think, what a funny hard white animal that is floating up there. When you swim up close all these little tentacles come waving out at you?" he wriggled his fingers?"and it goes Ah! Eeee! Oh, oh, oh!" At dawn, the rim of the sky bled like a wound. A white bird swooped low over the water, as if an invisible hand had pushed it down from the sky. When I stepped outside my tent I was nearly flung over by the wind. It rushed at my ears and made my eyes water. Too much wind, Glenn said, when we'd all arrived in the mess tent. It would be a long wait this morning before we could go out whale watching?if we could go out at all. After breakfast Sergio Flores, our other naturalist, joined me killing time in the mess tent. Younger than Chris, he was in his mid-twenties perhaps, and his English was spiced with a Mexican accent. He specialized, he said, in cetaceans. He'd just finished his masters in oceanography at the University of Baja California in Ensenada; in the fall, he would be going to do his doctorate in biotechnology at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He told me all this with a crisp self-assurance, lean ing forward with a smile to punctuate this point or that. Why had he chosen to study whales? 370</page><page sequence="13">Lay Thine Hand Upon Him Sergio flashed a smile. "I could write a poem about whales. Whales are super! But I could Uve without them in my academic career. I could write about, say, abalones. How do they respond to their environment? Their predators? How are they distrib uted, why are they there, how have they adapted? For me that's the chaUenge. If we understand ecology we can make better decisions, manage our resources better.That's what I want to do: research and help formulate and carry out policy." When he finished with his doctorate in Canada, would he come back to Mexico? "Of course!" Sergio drew himself up taU."I cannot be disloyal. I owe it to my country." By ten-thirty the wind had died down enough for whale watching. Chris poked his head into the mess tent and shouted, "You snooze you lose!" Out on the water, we motored to the Designated Whale Watching Area. A whale was breaching, but so far in the distance that it looked like a potato bug. We passed a cow and her calf; they dove away from us. I was sitting in between two women from Los Angeles, the wiUowy Amy and KeUy, who had blunt-cut hair and a dimpled Peter Pan face. They had met in Italy seven years ago; ever since, they vacationed together. "Twice a year," KeUy said. Our driver steered us into the middle of a fluke print and cut the motor. We waited. The boat rocked gently. "Look!" KeUy nearly jumped out of her seat as three fins slid by. "Dolphins!" Amy said, "Last year we went snorkeUng with the dolphins in St. Croix." "Yeah," KeUy said. "Remember those funny signs there underwater?" "Yeah, like, Here's some coral, in case ya didn't know." "ActuaUy" KeUy said, "my favorite marine mammal is the penguin. I love dolphins, but I really love penguins. We went to 371</page><page sequence="14">The Massachusetts Review the Galapagos Islands to see the penguins. Did you know that the penguins that live on the Galapagos are the northernmost penguins in the world?" I confessed I hadn't known that. "You should see them swim." Kelly made a gliding motion with her hand. "They are so beautiful." And what was their next trip? "Australia," Kelly said. "The Great Barrier Reef," Amy said. "But first she's gotta learn to dive." Kelly elbowed Amy in the ribs. "She can't even swim." "I get around with my flippers on," Amy said. So whose idea was this whale-watching trip? "Mine," Kelly said. "If it were up to her, we'd be in a Holiday Inn somewhere in the Caribbean doing nothing." "Oh, yeah," Amy said dreamily. "My next vacation is gonna be in a hotel with hot water." "Well," Kelly said, "it would be great to swim with the dol phins in the Bahamas." She picked up her camera. After a while, she said to no one in particular, "I really love dolphins." The morning, like the two whale-watching sessions the day before, was, friendly-wise, a disappointment. On our way back, we saw a coyote trotting along the shore, its tail between its legs. I skipped the afternoon whale-watching session. The heat, the waiting; it was too exhausting. And now, as it apparently did every night, the wind was picking up and the temperature began dropping rapidly. The sides of the canvas mess tent shook, and the tent poles rattled as we lined up for dinner. There was only one more day of whale watching, Kelly said as she took a plate. "And gosh darned if I'm not gonna touch one!" "They're shy right now," Lisa said. She was standing behind me in line. "Chris says they're more friendly by about mid February" "Now they tell me," Amy laughed. 372</page><page sequence="15">Lay Thine Hand Upon Him "So you didn't touch one either," I said, spooning chopped steak onto my plate. "We saw a whale trying to mate with a dolphin," KeUy said. "Poor dolphin!" Lisa said. "That kind ofthing happens," Amy said darkly. "Yeah," a woman named Cheryl said. "You know those Earthwatch trips where you get to help with the orangutan research in Borneo? They teU the women not to walk in the jun gle alone." "Eew," Lisa said. She held the spoon in mid-air. "No lie," Cheryl said. "Orangutans." Amy said, "Sounds like some men I know." The talk about other tours: it didn't stop. I found a place at the table next to HoUy's dad, Hal. "What you want to do," Hal was saying in a loud professorial voice, "is go on one that has a barge."Those were your first choice for a biking tour in HoUand, because then if you got tired of biking, you could just ride along on the barge. "And the food!" his wife said. Her name was Rhonda. She was a petite woman with a riot of frizzy red hair. "Great French food," Hal interrupted. "ReaUy great, and they give you wine with every meal." "It's so rich you couldn't possibly bike it off," Rhonda said. "We tried!" Hal patted his stomach. "WeU, I dunno."This was Sam, a retired dentist from Salt Lake City. He and his wife were celebrating their forty-fifth anniver sary with this whale-watching trip. "I'd do the biking thing in HoUand, but Dotty s got a mind to go see the polar bears." "You mean one of those tours out of ChurchiU, on Hudson Bay?" Rhonda asked. "Yeah," Sam said. "They have these vehicles, kind of like armored trucks? You can get real close." As I walked back to my tent I winced in the chiU. The night was like the others: the stars so bright and close, the stiff damp wind blowing in from the ocean. A cloud blew across the face of the moon, thin like a scarf. I remembered then something that Chris had said in his slide show, that as recently as ten thousand 373</page><page sequence="16">The Massachusetts Review years ago, Laguna San Ignacio did not exist. A million years ago the sea flooded the Vizcaino Desert, turning the peaks of the Sierra de Santa Clara into islands. That was why everywhere around the bay?even on the floor of our tents?there were shells and bits of shells embedded in the sandy soil. Three million years before that?yesterday by the scale of evolution?the Sea of Cort?s did not exist either. I thought of another thing Chris had said, that the whales first emerged twenty-six million years ago. An uncanny sight: with the lanterns on inside, our tents looked like a string of glowing orbs half-buried in the sand. The tents creaked and flapped in the wind, a sad sound, like little ani mals crying. I ducked into my tent, yanked off my shoes, and with all my clothes on zipped myself into my sleeping bag and curled up tight into a ball. Dawn was a dim gray glow that didn't seem to be coming from any one direction. I made my way through the swirling murk to the kitchen tent. Inside, a gas-powered lamp cast weak blue light over a jumble of crates and coolers stacked on the sandy ground. Alejandro, the cook who had told me about his whale video, was cracking eggs into a skillet. He wore an apron, but otherwise he was dressed for a ski resort in a heavy flannel shirt and deerskin snow boots. Next to the stove were a basket of brown eggs and a tub piled high with tiny limes. A kettle of coffee boiled noisily on the back burner. Alejandro poured me a mug and brought me a chair. The menu this morning was omelettes, and he was making two at a time. I'd been impressed by his enthusiasm for the whales, I said, his whale T-shirt, the fact that he'd made a video. What was it that was so special about the whales? He frowned as he sprinkled a handful of cheese over the eggs. "For me, whales are something that have to do with work." He was from La Paz, and he'd worked on a variety of Baja Ex peditions trips?cruises, bike tours, diving, and kayaking. "I like kayaking best because there's snorkeling, hiking, volleyball, lots of 374</page><page sequence="17">Lay Thine Hand Upon Him activities. But diving?" He shrugged. "Diving is just diving." And whale watching? "I started with the whale trips seven years ago." And what did he think about the whale trips? "You feel desperate because you start at a low level. If you're married it's difficult. You've got to be single. We work for eight months. We do various things. I like what I do. If you like what you do, that's best." He puUed down the oven door, eased an omelette onto a cookie sheet, slid the sheet back in and pushed the door shut, aU in a single graceful motion. "There's salary differentials," he went on. "You go from C to B to A to double A and then triple A. Head guides are almost always Americans, like Glenn and Chris. They have a university education and a lot of experience. You've got to speak English." But his English was very good, I said. "Oh, but perfectly, you have got to speak English perfectly. Or you've got to go to university, like Sergio. To move up with experience alone is reaUy difficult. But I learn a lot here. I've always had this idea that I want to be a chef in a hotel in La Paz. So I have to learn to cook with more elegance. That's why I'm trying new things, like using or?gano." And the whales? He'd seemed so thriUed when I'd asked him about them the other night. "The whales.. ."Alejandro cracked another egg into the skil let. He stirred thoughtfuUy "WeU, they are very special because they come here. They need this shaUow lukewarm water." I tried another tack. "When you were growing up in La Paz, did you know about the gray whales?" "No. I didn't know that the whales came here or why they would come here?and I was living one block away from the sea! When I came here with Baja Expeditions, I was surprised that tourists would pay to come see this?that there was work in this, that's what reaUy surprised me." He folded another omelette and slid it into the oven. "I used to be the panga driver. But now I have to wait a turn to go out. Maybe I'U get to go out today." And at the thought of this, Alejandro was transformed, suddenly happy as a Uttle kid, waving 375</page><page sequence="18">The Massachusetts Review his spatula like a wand. "I hope today! I hope I can go out today and find a whale!" How did it feel to touch one? "Smooth, smooth." His voice trailed off to a whisper as he lid ded his eyes. "Oh, very smooth!' Luckily, today the sun had burned off the fog by the time we were ready to go out whale watching. Like everyone else, I was keen to touch a whale; but I just could not bear it, the thought of sitting out there for another several hours in the hot sun, motoring around in circles. We still had one more whale-watch ing session in the afternoon; I decided to skip the morning ses sion and read. I settled into a chair by my tent on the bluff overlooking the lagoon. It was hard to concentrate; the breeze ruffled the pages, and the water sparkled like a carpet of jewels. After a while, I left the book in my lap and closed my eyes. A fishing boat roared by, heading out toward the Pacific. I could hear pots and pans clat tering in the kitchen tent, and scrubbing. Someone (Alejandro?) was singing, but with the shifting breeze, I could only make out a few words, mi coraz?n... cuando fui al otro lado... te quiero. A bird cried out: caw-ki-ki-ki; someone in the kitchen tent whistled sharply. Soon the breeze began to calm and the air warmed. I dozed. CHU! A whale was spouting, out in the middle of the lagoon. Another: louder.Where? Another! This time I spotted the puff of vapor towards the mouth of the lagoon, perhaps two miles away. A moment later, a blow shot up so far east, towards the head of the lagoon, that it looked as though it were coming from the base of the Tres Virgenes volcano?yet I could hear it full and clear. CHU! The blows came singly and in pairs, a few seconds to more than a minute apart. Chris had said that there might be as many as four hundred whales in the lagoon at any one time. I'd found that hard to believe until now. For a long while, I scanned the hard blue shimmer: listening. 376</page><page sequence="19">Lay Thine Hand Upon Him "You snooze you lose!" Chris shouted. It was time for the after noon whale watching session, our final one. HoUy had touched a whale in the morning, a calf, right on the tip of its nose. And not only that, HoUy bragged, her dad had filmed it, too. Sheer elation? An experience that might change my life? It stiU seemed possible that I might actuaUy touch a whale. The panga driver motored us out to the Designated Whale Watching Area. It was hot. We saw a whale; it swam away. We saw a cow and calf; we motored up; they swam away. We saw the hump of a gray's ridged back; we saw it blow. It sank down and disappeared. The bench felt hard as cement. In our rubber boots and rub ber ponchos and thick bulky life jackets, we began to sweat. Jimmy and Johnny Carpenter sat at the front of the panga, their elbows on their knees, moping. An hour passed. And another hour passed. The engine burbled, the water sloshed gently against the huU. The sun was sinking; flocks of pelicans began to fly inland, one after the other. Another whale surfaced, blew, and sank down. Lisa, who I'd imagined to be a comrade-in-suffering, her jaw grimly set, eyes glinting narrowly over the waters of our foUy, blurted: "This is so great!" Beneath the halo of her floppy white golf hat, she smiled beatificaUy. "It's like when I was on the tour in Canada offVancouver Island to see the oreas? We went out on little Zodiacs, and we were right up close, surrounded by whales, just like this." She pointed her video camera at yet another ridged hump, perhaps fifty feet away. "The funny thing is, there was a big cruise ship nearby? They sent out a guy in a Zodiac with a camera so he could feed back a live video of the oreas to everybody on board." She turned to me. "Isn't that just awful?" There was a little red square on her forehead where she'd pressed it against the viewfinder. "TeU me," she said. "Why would anyone pay to go aU the way to Vancouver Island and then watch the whales on video?" 377</page><page sequence="20">The Massachusetts Review Now she had her Nikon camera out. She adjusted the zoom lens and started clicking: a whale was swimming towards our panga. It dipped beneath us, came up on the other side, and blew, GHU/The mist rained to the water. The whale came back again, sinking down to glide below. In a moment, its head bobbed up again just?barely?beyond arm's reach. "A friendly!" Johnny cried, and he stood up, wobbling the boat. His mother, Joanne, leaned out and lightly plashed her hand in the water. Jim began filming, swinging his big box of a video camera first right, then left as the whale swam back and forth, each time passing just a shade closer to our panga. "Ah!" Lisa said as it bobbed its head up, inches?tantalizing inches?beyond her fingertips. "Oh! Oh!" The panga listed as Lisa, Joanne, Johnny, and Jimmy all leaned out, trying to touch the whale. It sank down; it surfaced on the other side. CHU! We all reached out with a chorus of "Oh, oh, oh!" My God, I thought as I reached out my hand, I might actually touch a whale! This wild, living thing the length of a four-story building! The boat listed with our weight, its rim falling to inches from the water's surface. My fingers stretched long until my shoulder ached. And my fingertips were not three inches from the table of slick, glistening skin when?out of nowhere it seemed?another panga came roaring up. With a foot on the prow like Washington crossing the Delaware, a burly man in a camouflage jacket and a cowboy hat aimed his video camera like a weapon at our whale. Three hefty blondes were in the boat with him, all in black biker's shorts and big sloppy T-shirts that hung down from underneath their life jackets. Painted on the hull of their boat was the name KUYIMA?the cheaper Mexican tour operator. Within spitting distance from our panga, the trio of blondes leaned over the sides, butts in the air, and started shoveling the water with their hands. "HERE!" They shouted at our whale. "HERE! Get over HEM!" One of the blondes pounded her fist against the hull of the boat. "Come ON!" 378</page><page sequence="21">Lay Thine Hand Upon Him Stunned, we sat on our benches and watched as our whale bobbed around the interlopers. One of the blondes started snap ping pictures?with a disposable camera. Lisa hissed: "Trailer people." "That's it," Joanne huffed. "Now I don't want to whale watch anymore." "I hope they faU in," Johnny said. "Vultures!" Jim chuckled, as he started videotaping them. Perhaps we hadn't tried hard enough, I thought, as I watched the blondes so vigorously thrashing their arms in the water, shouting and banging. Like almost everyone else on the Baja Expeditions tour, I'd been content to simply sit, as if I were on some genteel amusement ride, and wait. Chris was right: by the end of the week I did have my own technique for finding whales. Not that it worked. It was smaU consolation, but before any of the blondes could touch it, our whale lost interest and swam away. "Served them right," Joanne harumphed. We watched the panga roar away, our own panga rocking in its wake. The sunlight had faded to a rich gold. It was nearly six; time to head back to camp for dinner. Flock after flock of seabirds was heading inland after the day's fishing: a line of pelicans, a crowd of fork-tailed terns, a wedge of cormorants, white-tailed brant geese, more pelicans. Here and there, a straggler flapped by low over the water. "It's just not fair!" Lisa said. We'd come aU this way, sat hour after hour in a panga; we'd slept in tents, we'd baked, we'd frozen, we'd put up with having to use a latrine, we'd had no hot water. "Why, even"?she laughed at herself as she said this?"the driver feels sorry for us!" Without a word, he cut the engine. He'd spotted a whale loUing on its side, one flipper in the air, maybe twenty feet away. It was a long shot, but worth one last try. We bobbed on the chop of the lagoon for a minute or so, waiting. Dup-dup-dup, we tapped our feet against the bottom of the boat. I plashed the water with my hand, halfheartedly. And then, with a great lazy slap of its flukes, the whale sank down and disappeared. The wind 379</page><page sequence="22">The Massachusetts Review was blowing now, and the water moved by swiftly, carrying its fluke print away. The driver had just revved the motor when Joanne spotted a tern that was standing on something in the water. As we approached, the bird fluttered up and hovered, its bright-yellow legs dangling like twigs. "It's a turtle ?"Johnny shouted. "The bird was standing on the back of a turtle!" Lisa pursed her lips. "That's just a buoy." The driver let the panga drift in closer. A grayish-green oval was floating there?an oval with flippers and a head. It was a tur tle. The tern alighted again on its perch. We all started filming and photographing. "Cool," Johnny said. But the turtle wasn't moving. I said, "I think it's dead." "Si," the driver said. "Est? muerta." "Dead!" Joanne slumped her shoulders. The bird flew off. We sat for a moment bobbing on the water in peevish silence. "Well, I don't care," Joanne finally said. "If I can't touch a whale?" She turned around and gestured at the driver. "Come on, pull right up." He angled the rudder and let the boat drift closer. Jim shoul dered his video camera and began taping as his wife leaned out and rapped the carapace with her knuckles. Thook. "I did it," she said, and she sat back down. "And I filmed you doing it," Jim said nicely. She turned to her boys. "Don't tell anyone it was dead." They rolled their eyes. The next morning we were back on the bus heading for the airstrip. "So," said Sam the retired dentist from Salt Lake City. "Did you touch a whale?" "No," I confessed. "And you?" "Nope. But we had a good time anyhow." 380</page><page sequence="23">Lay Thine Hand Upon Him His wife, Dotty, patted his hand. "Yes, we did," she said. "It was a great trip." It was hard to talk. We were bouncing over the washboard road, the bus scranching loudly in low gear. I looked out the window: pickleweed, ocotiUo, the great bowl of weepy sky. An osprey sliced low through the air, heading toward the water. HoUy was the one member of this tour who, as far I knew, had actuaUy touched a whale. She was an experienced traveler, she'd told me on the first day. She'd already been to many places in Mexico: Cabo San Lucas, Costa Rica, and Ecuador, for instance. She seemed a happy, talkative child, but now that the trip was finished?we were at the airstrip now, waiting for our luggage to be unloaded from the bus?she stood away from everyone else, scowling and kicking at the sandy ground with her sneaker. "How about you?" I asked KeUy. "Did you touch a whale?" She hadn't. "But I did," her friend Amy said. "FinaUy." What was it like? "Slick like a stingray." Amy shrugged. "I loved the dolphins," KeUy said as Glenn, the camp director, joined us. "You know what?" she said to Glenn. "This was even better than seeing elephants in Africa." "Oh, yeah," Amy said. "In Africa you see so many, it's Uke, ele phants, elephants, elephants, aU the time. You totaUy get sick of elephants." "But this was great," KeUy said. "This was even better even than the Galapagos." "Oh, yeah," Amy said. "WeU," said Glenn in his deep and meUow voice, a broad smile crinkling his sun-weathered face. "I'm glad you liked it." aTo protect their privacy, the names and some of the identifying charac teristics of the tour members have been changed. 381</page></plain_text>
