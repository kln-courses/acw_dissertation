<plain_text><page sequence="1">can" may have to do with the manner in which sex- ual relations and sexual organs are seen, as well as with the ancient placement of sexually related con- cerns within a sphere close to identity. In any case, Green suggests, the categorization of STDs as "Afri- can" goes hand-in-hand with healers' claims to be able to treat these diseases. Such a claim need not be taken literally, although it is a factor that needs to be entertained in planning any campaign. This is because African healers expect, and their publics assume, that an STD will be better treated by a healer than by a clinic because of the alignment of the disease's categorization with the expectation that the healer will know what to do with this "Afri- can" disease. Too many STD and AIDS campaigns have totally ignored the healers' or the public's ex- pectations, opting instead to work around what is already being done. Condom distribution, the most prominent of the treatments coming out of Western health circles, has yet to become fully effective in any known program in Africa. The litmus test for this issue of involving healers in health campaigns may be based on the answers to two related questions. First, if healers' treatments for STDs result at least somewhat in the reduction of infection rates (or in the improvement of health in- dicators), should this information be used as the ba- sis for AIDS prevention and control programs? Sec- ond, if the first question is answered affirmatively, then should the medicines they use be identified and tested with regard to the treatment of (or at least positive effects on) HIV-positive or AIDS sufferers? This book has some of the characteristics of a re- port on numerous disease-prevention and health- promotion projects. Nevertheless, the focused na- ture of the investigation, and the related evidence the author marshals to assess both sides of the ques- tion of the use of healers in health campaigns, makes it valuable for policy debate. The readable prose and vivid case-study format, coupled with the book's reasonable price, should also make this book an asset in courses in international health, medical anthropology, and African Studies. Objects: Signs of Africa. LUC DE HEUSCH, ed. Tervuren, Belgium: Musee royal de I'Afrique centrale, 1995. Charts, figures, photographs, color plates, maps. WYATT MACGAFFEY Haverford College Books commissioned to accompany art exhibi- tions usually group together papers attendant on the theme of the exhibition itself, chosen on curatorial grounds. This collection of essays, although pub- lished on the occasion of the important exhibition, Treasures of Tervuren, differs from the associated book of that name (and from most such books) in that it has a theme of its own-that of securing a new footing for an aesthetic approach to African objects. It is time, declares de Heusch in his intro- duction, to do away with arbitrary distinctions be- tween form and function, and to restore to objects plucked from their context a sense of the meaning they originally had. De Heusch's stricture appears to be directed against art dealers and "a certain type of art history" (p. 10) in which separate chapters on form and function evade the task of relating the two; yet de Heusch mentions none of the many eth- nographers of African art in the United States and Britain who, one would have thought, have already done much to fulfill his objective. But let us not be too competitive; it is a rare pleasure to read a book so lavishly provided with the sort of striking photo- graphs one usually finds only in catalogs, and to have available photographs of objects so well sup- ported by ethnography. Pierre de Maret provides a comprehensive and highly readable account of copper crosses from Katanga. Dunja Hersak summarizes the signifi- cance of colors, stripes, and projections on the se- ductive kifwebe masks of the Songye in eastern Zaire before exploring the enigmas presented by shields from the same area that carry bosses in the form of kifwebe. Pierre Petit explains the Luba fig- ures that show a kneeling woman hearing a bowl: the bowl or calabash contains the white porcelain clay (mpemba) that signifies that the chief or diviner who owns it has been authenticated by the water- dwelling vidye spirits responsible for prosperity and clairvoyance. The female figure represents the (male) owner, described as the "bride" of the spirits, in an idiom widespread throughout West and Cen- tral Africa. Still in Zaire, but this time on the Atlantic coast, Mulinda (the only African contributor) pro- vides by far the best available account of the masks used by the bandunga, members of a sort of police association among the BaWoyo (western Kongo). These masks can only be "read" in association with proverbs indicated by discrete signs on each type of mask. The extraordinary leaf-masks of the Bwaba in Burkina Faso (neighbors of the Dogon), together with the commentary on them derived by Michele Coquet from Bwaba mythology, go far to support de Heusch's contention that to understand such ob- jects "we must start with death and work our way backward to the origins of the world" (p. 1 1). Before the end of the dry season, when the first leaves ap- pear, so do the leaf masks-mysteriously spherical masses that rush through the village to announce the opening of cult of Doo, the first-born of the Sun and the Moon and the central figure in Bwaba cos- mogony. Masks that emerge later in the ritual cycle take on anthropomorphic features, but are also linked to complex ideas about birds, bees, porcu- pines, hornbills, pottery, and smithing. The ritual cycle is clearly and explicitly linked to the indige- nous model of Bwaba social structure, but the masks also "translate as much by their plastic con- ception as by their behavior the different stages of certain cosmogonic events, from the creation of the world to the creation of the human face" (p. 32). Philippe Jespers gives a comparably complex analysis of Komo society masks among the Miny- anka in Mali, but unfortunately makes no reference to the work of Patrick McNaughton, who presents such masks in a very different light. Viviane Baeke shows how, among the Wuli of Cameroon, masks permute with musical instruments, wooden statu- ettes, and clay figurines as the ritual instruments of 490 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="2">the exclusively male associations that fight witch- craft, theft, and other wrongdoing. The contributors are all friends, students, and col- laborators of De Heusch, whose spirit (or, less gen- erously, special preoccupations) presides over the whole. A gradient can be discerned from concerns that are primarily documentary, historical, and cu- ratorial, to those that ascend to an empyrean of cos- mology, metaphor, and aesthetic rapture, as in R. Devisch's pursuit of the multiple associations of the Yaka diviner's slitdrum. This kind of writing-lack- ing the discipline that might be imposed by respect for indigenous commentaries, including myths- arouses the kind of unease that is also aroused by high-art photographs of African objects, striking though they are. Filters and careful lighting appeal to a particular aesthetic and compensate for the loss of the sort of emotional energy that in the real world such objects, like rituals and cosmologies, derive from the human problems with which they deal; the seductive results are nevertheless reinventions and appropriations. De Heusch concludes the volume with a detailed analysis of Tetela and Nkutshu traditions of origin from an area of the forest north of the Songye. He seems to be settling scores with authorities who have misattributed Songye masks to the Tetela, and perhaps with other scholars as well, but his discus- sion leads into an account of the use by the Tetela of certain figures used in the rituals of the nkumi as- sociation, and to the elaborately painted faces- virtual "masks"-of its dancers. Finally, A. B. West's translations from the French are both colloquial and unidiomatic, with fre- quently disconcerting results. The remaining trans- lations by Michael Novy are much easier to read. Nuer Dilemmas: Coping with Money, War, and the State. SHARON A. HUTCHINSON. Berke- ley: University of California Press, 1996. xviii + 408 pp., illustrations, appendix, bibliography, index. SALLY FALK MOORE Harvard University This is a remarkable book that makes innovative contributions, both informational and methodologi- cal. It not only tells us what Sharon Hutchinson ob- served of Nuer life at the time of her fieldwork (a 21-month period in the early 1980s with some brief revisits in 1990 and 1992), but it also tells us a great deal about what the Nuer themselves have to say about their situation. More than that, Hutchinson's book fills some of the historical space between Evans-Pritchard's field data and her own with an artful use of materials that draw both on Howell's work and on a variety of official records, including some rich data from the courts. But as if this were not enough, she does more, pointing to striking contrasts between the Eastern and Western Nuer, and explaining these contrasts on the grounds of differing historical experiences. Since all Africanists and many other anthropolo- gists know E. E. Evans-Pritchard's classic ethno- graphic work backwards and forwards, this new material will be of wide professional interest. Evans- Pritchard's trilogy (The Nuer [Oxford: Clarendon Press 1940], Kinship and Marriage among the Nuer [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1951], and Nuer Reli- gion [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1956]), based on fieldwork done during the 1930s, is deep in the consciousness of the profession. Thus Hutchinson has set herself the daunting task of providing a run- ning commentary on the difference between her "now" and Evans-Pritchard's "then," her own re- flections and interpretations of these contrasts, and how they came about. The great thing that she does at the same time is to give us a rich sample of the self-reflexive commentary of her Nuer friends and acquaintances. What emerge are the contradictory practices and convictions that exist side by side. In one of Hutchinson's minor examples, for instance, the sons of the literate political elite refused to submit to the scarification of initiation (p. 270). The wider community continued to require this ritual. There were clearly different views of what it meant to be initiated, what it meant to be a man, and what re- jecting scarification signified. Nevertheless, the very fact that a powerful group was against the practice must have let skepticism seep into the at- mosphere. Cultural and social assumptions once tranquilly accepted by most people became points of speculation, disagreement, and contention. Hutchinson has made these "disturbed assump- tions" her focus, and therein lies the striking origi- nality of her book. This is a brilliant device: it is a means by which cultural transformation may be de- picted in process, permitting many quite different types of information to be integrated into the story. It permits Hutchinson both to give specific details about actual events and sequences of change with dates and places when she has the details, and to leave it at "then" and "now" when she does not. The focus on "disturbed assumptions" not only saves Hutchinson from a year-by-year history that most likely cannot be reconstructed anyway, but also saves her from other totalizing efforts, such as trying to describe the workings of the larger econ- omy or the polity of the Southern Sudan. But Hutchinson is not all poetics. She interrupts the vivid language and the metaphors of the Nuer to address the reader directly with horrifying informa- tion-intermittent reminders of tragedy and strug- gle: civil war, death and fighting, modern weapons, repeated shortages of food, high infant mortality, massive losses of cattle, and the increasing role of migrant labor and cattle markets. Hutchinson also never lets the reader forget that these unending cri- ses and radical changes were accompanied by deeply unsettling ideas. The thematic technique of presentation in Nuer Dilemmas is a spectacular tour de force. Hutchin- son is dealing with many different time periods, many different types of evidence, and many inevita- ble gaps; and the populations among which she worked had been radically disrupted by the first civil war (1955-72) and, later, by the resumption of the civil war (1983). As Hutchinson reminds us, this was not a conflict innocent of economic motives: there were considerable oil reserves in the South.
