<plain_text><page sequence="1">WEISS'S DOCTRINE OF CONCERN ROBERT W. BROWNING O et in a metaphysics of evolution, expressly devised to avoid both reductionism and "unwarranted addition," Paul Weiss offers us a new De Anima.1 His speculative system a attempts both to recognize the general continuities which are presumed by evolutionary naturalism and the discontinuities which seemingly do emerge at various levels, perhaps most vividly apparent in cognition and moral activity.3 The resulting cosmological scheme is at once an organicism (taking account of sensitivity, reflexes, instincts, habits, perception and intelligence) and a quasi substantialism (explaining persistence, expression, the unity of response, consistency of purpose, mind, self and guilt). I In order to stay within bounds, the present essay must be severely restricted. I have elected to focus on the notion of concern. Further, with respect to it, I aim?in addition to offering some exposition?chiefly to do two things: first, to raise queries about the evidence for the exemplification of the general notion; second, to focus more specifically upon the nature of alleged human concern and upon its relation to ethics. In both cases, the prime value of what is said may be to incite Weiss to a greater definiteness of articulation. As a background notion commonly ascribable to all actual beings, the idea of "concern" affords Weiss continuity; in the operation of its actual exemplifications it accounts for novelty 1 Perhaps most evidently in his Nature and Man (New York, 1947). 2 Begun in Reality (Princeton, 1938), and carried further in subse quent writings. 3 See particularly Man's Freedom (New Haven, 1950).</page><page sequence="2">WEISS'S DOCTRINE OF CONCERN 329 and sometimes for radical discontinuity. The major concept of freedom in Weiss's cosmology is not an infinite, wholly vacuous freedom, a completely pure chance, lacking reference to any object or objectives; it is specified in concerns which do have reference both to other entities and to internal demands. Concerns are thus also strategic in the description of actuality and possibility. The notion of concern is not only an interesting portion of Weiss's ontology; it is employed in determining the nature of selves, and is therein the ground of the ethical dimension. Indeed, derivatively, it seems to serve for Weiss as a theory at once of obligation, motivation and sanction. In it, somehow, man's duty and interest are universally reconciled; thus, one presumes, the old moral problems of egoism and of non-prudential regard for others are supposedly solved. What Weiss offers here is at once something associated with a major tradition and something marked by much novelty, sufficient for drawing a good deal of criticism. To go to human nature for a basis (or the basis) of ethics is an old and respectable current in Western reflection. Perhaps this foundation is particularly appropriate to "naturalism," and possibly when naturalism gets a relatively adequate conception of how selves emerge and what they are, the stock-in-trade of idealists, existentialists and various artists of the realm of subjectivity will no longer be such a rich source of embarrassment as it still is. However, one may doubt the propriety of referring to Weiss as a naturalist. In any case, he contributes a number of slants to the long dialogue of systems, and some of his challenge to reconstruc tion is made at a deep level. If one uncovers very little proof, one does find much suggestiveness. One may offer the blind guess that Weiss seized the originality in Whitehead's notion of subjective aim 4 and acclimatized it to a quite different sort of epochalism 5?an epochalism which is a quasi-substantialism. Presumably Weiss has felt that "creativity" must be assigned its locus in the acts of beings; such beings are 4 See Process and Reality (New York, 1929), particularly pp. 74 f., 108, 329-44, 420. 6 See Reality, pp. 184, 203-17, 230, 232 f., 259 ff.</page><page sequence="3">330 ROBERT W. BROWNING not to be conceived as primarily actual in one creative pulse of inheritance plus subjective aim, but are beings normally antecedent to and normally continuing after each act, which nevertheless to some degree is an occasion of free self-formation. He found a conception of "concern" in Whitehead, but seriously amended and extended the notion in a reconstruction designed to meet what he felt were grave defects. Weiss has been moved by the feeling that an atomism of occasions destroys responsibility and guilt. Some of his objections may have had their origin far from ethics; some plainly arose in the metaphysics of ethics. Weiss may have underestimated the role of formal inheritances and non substantial continuities in Whitehead's cosmology; in any case, Whitehead was highly alert to the problem (although perchance he was stimulated to be so by some of his bright students).6 No specific paternity is needed for Weiss's desire to embed his Of Whitehead, Weiss has written: "Though he has dressed his flux in rhythms he still has no entity which really persists. If the fundamental reality is creative passage, things can be but momentary accidents decorat ing events, and no matter how old a thing may be, we are bound to say that it is entirely new" (Reality, p. 208). The question which Weiss thereupon implicitly raises concerning responsibility is at least a legitimate query as to the locus of responsibility. For if, as Whitehead says, "No thinker thinks twice; and ... no subject experiences twice" (Process and Reality, p. 43), this would seem to separate the doer of the crime from the arrestee. If responsibility is to be charged, it will have to be to the "enduring object" or more specifically to the inherited form of personal order and not to the momentary experiencer. Weiss, in effect, joins all those critics of Buddhism who argued the breakage of responsibility between the non-substantial lives of different so-called "incarnations" connected by a transfer only of energy and form. To intimate that Whitehead was unaware of the problem would be gross distortion. It was one of the burdens of his later thinking; it enters into some of those passages which give one the same feeling as Part V of Spinoza's Ethics (e.g., Adventures of Ideas [New York, 1933], p. 267). He is ingenuous about it: "In our account of human experience we have attenuated human personality into a genetic relation between occasions of human experience. Yet personal unity is an inescapable fact" (ibid., p. 239). Cf. pp. 240 f., 262 ff., 271; cf. also Nature and Life (Chicago, 1934), pp. 38 ff. Again: "We cannot dismiss Personal Identiy without dismissing the whole of human thought as expressed in every language" ("Immortality," The Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead, ed. P. A. Schilpp [Evanston, 1941], p. 690).</page><page sequence="4">WEISS'S DOCTRINE OF CONCERN 331 theory of conatus in an evolutionary account. If the De Anima is not quite a precedent, evolutionism is ubiquitous in the mother sea from whence our intellectual questions come wriggling, and Peirce ( f ragmen t arily ), Alexander and WTiitehead had set examples II Weiss's doctrine of concern may be followed in each of his three major works, Reality, Nature and Man and Mans Freedom. In the first book, the conception is not yet baptized; the middle book is the best source for presentation of the general notion; the last book is necessary for further delineation of the differential properties of man's concern. Let us at once introduce a few points from the first of these volumes, both to justify our intimation that some notion of concern is implicitly present and to indicate a few lines of orientation. In our author's ontology, there is a plurality of real individual beings. Temporality is taken seriously; change occurs since these beings "act"; their respective presents are tensional toward the future, or toward the distributively possible futures. Individ ual things, inorganic and organic, "act" in order to realize the object of their "concern," whether it be so labelled or not. For present purposes, the reader of Reality should underscore the discussions of the ontological individual, its persistence, its privational possession and its "mellontological" causation. He should recognize the intent, in a philosophy of process, to acknowledge substantial individual being, and note the contention, in a world of the multiplicity of such beings, that each real unit is in some sense "unlimited in its total spread." 7 The individual 7 P. 182. Also, "Were there no individuals, there would only be the abstract which, because there were no individuals, could not be at all" (ibid., p. 176.) "We cannot say what individuates an individual . . . because individuals . . . are not consequences of the combination of aspects of themselves. . . Like living and dying, sleeping and waking, the being oneself is a private matter . . ." (pp. 177 f.). The privacy, however, does not mean that the individual is a Ding an sich; it is continuous with its characters.</page><page sequence="5">332 ROBERT W. BROWNING being is said to have a "focal region of maximum intensity" where the individual is actual; it also is said to be "outside itself in the shape of an extensively ordered series of intensities, pointing to other actualities beyond; a mark of the fact that the actuality is contingent and incomplete, incapable of standing entirely alone" (p. 183). Here the quasi-substantialism is already qualified with an organicism or universal relationism, and the basic postulate of the present incompleteness of the individual is affirmed. To each real entity the rest of the world is the counterpart in some sense?perhaps (as we shall later note) in the sense of being the field of objects for its uninhibited aggrandizement. The virtual aspect of the individual is peculiarly declared to be "entirely pri vate," while its actual aspect is at once private and public. I say "peculiarly," because in some phrasings it seems that the virtual vectoral spread of the individual is not only inner but is the presence, so to speak, of the individual to other individuals in its being the "ground for all the extensive relations which may stretch between them." 8 "Were an individual to appear in the farthest corner of the universe, every other would be instantly related to it," not because of an antecedent space but rather because of the reciprocal capacities of such individuals for the relations which constitute fields and space. If this language may seem to a reader to speak of an aspect which is simply "there" and not "dynamic," let him be reminded that the individual beings are striving entities, continually effecting change. ifTo be is to be incomplete; an actuality with its equilibrium outside itself; a reality whose boundaries lie some where in the future. . ." (p. 209). And: "Because to be is to be incomplete, each being must fail to complete itself and time must go on without end " (p. 215). Again: "All individuals, organic or inorganic, are in process because all are engaged in the attempt to make the privationally possessed actually part of themselves" (p. 261). Privational possession seems to be approximately 8 P. 182. One notes, for example, the phrasing in the following: "An actuality in which another's virtual region terminates is abstractly future for the actuality out of which that virtual region vectorally originates" (ibid., p. 223; italics added).</page><page sequence="6">WEISS'S DOCTRINE OF CONCERN 333 synonymous with a generalized notion of need, and each being apparently is held to need all other beings; thus, "The rest of the universe is now privationally within it; whatever lies outside it is but a part of its abstractly complete nature." * It would not be rash interpretation to say that here is something very like the doctrine of concern; here is the context that contains or calls for it, or at least here are notions closely associated with it. Perhaps the abstractly complete nature is the ground of the concrete demand and nisus to grow toward fulfilment, and such a demand is ineffectual unless it is specified with respect to the possibilities co determined by its nature and that of circumambient other real entities. In the later books, the notion of concern would seem to have differentia in some way requiring it to be more specified, or at least allowing it to become more specific, than a promiscuous privational possession of all things. (Also, possibly only selves are held to be so all-comprehensive in their concerns.) Already in Reality, however, Weiss talks about degrees of pertinence of differ ent items in an abstract future, and proceeds to sketch the frame work of a theory of valuation in the form of four different dimen sions or hierarchies of the bearing of entities and possibilities upon a given entity (pp. 251, 256 ff.). But we cannot go into these details here. The account of process is a "mellontological" theory of pro ductive causation. "The effects in the actual future are produced in the process whereby a being becomes actually future; they are the product of an actuality's effort to make its abstract future part of its being" (p. 236). The scheme is not devoid of some affinity with an Aristotelian doctrine of final causation, as Weiss himself notes, but it is without the fixity of an unchanging formal cause and without?it would sometimes seem?characteristic limits to what is demanded by a member of a species. Instead, as Weiss later explicitly notes, the final causes?considered in other than the P. 247. "The actual future is not . . . part of an endless, fixed chain of discrete extensions relentlessly moving towards us; it is a partly unpre dictable result, produced by the action of beings endeavoring to assimilate others now abstractly future to them" (p. 224).</page><page sequence="7">334 ROBERT W. BROWNING most abstract way?change with the content of the universe." And whether each being is infinitely predatory, or whether each being (in contrast, it seems to me) contains consciously or unconsciously "mystical experience," or whether in some fashion both of these assertions are maintained, as different texts suggest, is one of the questions we shall later wish to ask of Weiss. For our present inquiry, Nature and Man is the best source. It is the first of the major works in which the notion of concern is self-consciously pursued; in Reality, it had not yet risen to genuine explicitness, and in Man s Freedom it is presupposed and used. In Nature and Man the evolutionary role of mutation in concern is delineated. Reality was almost atemporal in its perspective ?above deciding whether once there existed only simple units without supervening wholes, whether eventually there will only be indivisibles, whether there always have been supervening individuals as well as incorporated indivisibles, and when the divisible unities have been inorganic and when "organic." xl Nature and Man is a philosophy of evolution, sketching at least the progressive development of some characteristic formations of our cosmic epoch. For answers to important questions about man's concern, however, and how it is the ground of the moral dimension, recourse must be had to Man s Freedom. Ill Before centering attention upon the concern distinctive of man, it is desirable to take a synoptic glance at the notion of concern in general and at its matrix meaning in Weiss's evolution ary cosmography. A concern?and each being has a concern?is a "way of reaching from the concrete present into the abstract future," enabling the being to focus on that future (which is common to all 10 Nature and Man, p. 55. 11 Reality, pp. 196 ff.</page><page sequence="8">WEISS'S DOCTRINE OF CONCERN 335 beings) in an individualized way, "in the shape of a limited, pertinent possibility." 12 When an inanimate thing is "frustrated," it is most likely to change into some other kind of inanimate thing; but it may change its concern in a certain way?such that it is "able to act on others in terms of the goods it prescribes for them"?and thus become a living thing, expressing a "concern for goods pertinent at least to offspring or kind." 13 Thus is the origin of life explained. In affirming that the living can arise from the non-living, Weiss cautiously points out that he is not dogmatically asserting that there was a time when there was no life, for there may have been living things "whose bodies cannot be or were not fossilized." He observes the paradox that Aristotle, in non-conformity with his supposition of fixed divisions, asserted spontaneous generation and thus was "right in principle," whereas Pasteur, right in selected detail, held what was contrary to "the essence of modern science." "Higher living beings," in Weiss's philosophy of evolution, "arise from lower ones for the same reason that the living arise from the non-living?the bodies of the lower beings effectively resist the expression of their concerns." 14 Weiss observes that useful little variations do not force a change of essential nature, whereas radical changes in the organism "remain useless or dan gerous unless accompanied by a change within." Contrary then to the theory of evolution by the preservation of random useful variations, he concurs with Bergson and others that some different account is needed for the origin of complex organs. Indeed, "It is thus not the useful but the useless or dangerous mutations which mark the points at which new types of beings first emerge," for their shock "challenges the being to change its nature" (p. 101). Much of this sounds quite anthropomorphic, or at least reminiscent of Whitehead's extension of "higher" categories 12 Nature and Man, p. 53. 13 Ibid., pp. 70-76. 14 Weiss rightly asserts that just because there is "no place where a clear line can be drawn between the lower and the higher subhuman beings" does "not mean that we cannot distinguish the more obviously higher from the more obviously lower. . ." (Nature and Man, p. 100).</page><page sequence="9">336 ROBERT W. BROWNING downward in an effort neither to deny features of experience which are lived nor to have a dualistic (bifurcated) break in nature. Most understandably, Weiss, like many of the rest of us, wants both continuity of explanation and recognition of discontinuity of the natures of things. His philosophy of evolution is then not too shocking in being both mutationistic, in asserting sudden jumps, and Lamarckian, in counting upon an inner adaptive responsive ness to the challenge of ineptitude of body or resistance of environ mental obstacles. Almost in the tradition of "bathmism" and of Erasmus, Darwin and Goethe, the treatment of the steps of real evolution is suggestive of Lamarck's second law, concerning the origination of new organs from felt inner want, and is not wholly devoid of similarity to Schopenhauer's allegation of the objectified presence of differentiated will in the body. One recalls the "ups and-downs" of this notion, re-incarnating in new forms, through more than a century. Accordingly, one is not unprepared to meet new revivals of the theme, although one recalls, for example, a man with the authority of T. H. Morgan coming to a strong anti Lamarckian position in his Theory of the Gene, after having obtained initial superficial evidence in its favor. Despite the abstract continuity affirmed by his doctrine of the ubiquity of freedom, and despite his denials of the body-mind dualisms of Descartes and Kant,15 Weiss recognizes that organisms differ "radically" from the inanimate and he asserts that man differs from other organisms by an equally wide gulf "because of his capacity to grasp the total nature of things."16 Indeed, he declares, "Nature is more an affair of fits and starts, of breaks and bumps, than of smooth and easy passage, of continuity and harmony." 17 In living beings, unconscious and conscious valuation arises. When their structure is somewhat stabilized, living beings "have a native wisdom driving them outside situations which have no 15 "We cannot put a man's body into a determined world and keep his soul outside, without making him, as both Descartes and Kant were forced to do, into two distinct beings" (ibid., p. 27). Cf. pp. xv, 110 ff. 16 Reality, p. 285. However, there is a sense in which he seems to hold that all things prehend all things?though of course not consciously. 17 Nature and Man, p. xvii.</page><page sequence="10">WEISS'S DOCTRINE OF CONCERN 337 pertinence to their welfare, towards those which would benefit them, and away from those which would harm them." This wisdom is "rooted deep within them, quite below consciousness, untaught by either parents or experience." Weiss rejects the view that this wisdom lies in "the juices and tendons," for it "seems to concern the welfare of the whole" organism. Thus he espouses the view that "the organism has a set of native and unlearned drives appropriate to the welfare of itself and its kind." 18 One wonders if these drives are part of the denotation of "concern," or are the native springs of concerns, or neither. Probably they are conceived as manifestations of concern, although questions of relative generality and relative specificity thereupon follow. One is also curious as to whether some of these characterizations are held to apply to plant life; except for the physiological reference to "tendons," restriction to animal life is not apparent. "Sensitivity" names the condition of being keyed to act in terms of one's decisions?decisions that define how much one will adhere to one's own concern and how much one will accept the prescriptions which the concerns of other beings lay upon one. The range of sensitivity is not exactly confined to the realm of competent action (there would then be no distress and despair), but there is a general correlation. Extent of range is a rough measure of the level of life. The elm is "sensitive to soil, air and sun," but insensitive to axes and men.19 Apparently man's con cern includes?or perhaps, uses?much sensitivity and purpose. Sensitivity, of course, need not convey any eulogistic flavor of sympathy; it need not even be conscious. A body can be sensitive 18 Ibid., p. 91. Of course, this wisdom is not "complete"; it is tinged with "folly." Lack of opportunity, including engrossment in the struggle to exist, prevents as much folly from occurring as would otherwise obtain. Successful habits normally check folly (as well as exhibit it in highly novel situations). Similarly with the emergence of an order of dominance among needs. As one moves up the ladder of life, sensitiveness and purposiveness are seen to play greater roles in checking folly (pp. 93 f.). w P. 96. Oddly, purposiveness names the tendency of an organism "to act in the light of what it sensitively discerns, so as to realize an unknown good" (p. 97). A living being below the level of man "is blindly purposive, purposive without a purpose, and therefore does not act with the nicety which the fulfillment of its ends requires" (p. 98).</page><page sequence="11">338 ROBERT W. BROWNING without being conscious; a minimum sensitivity is necessary in order for it to be alive (p. 103). All living beings have some kind of tension between their concerns and their changing bodies. In conscious beings the changes in tension are explicitly felt?in pleasure and pain. Consciousness requires an organism's capacity at once to vary its approach and to adhere to and to change its concern (p. 106). "Consciousness arises when sensitive beings freely keep their con cerns steady despite changing bodies" (p. 102). Pain is said to register the fact "that the being no longer controls the destiny of that which it had made an intimate part of itself, that its concern cannot be expressed where it had been expressed before." Pleasure "is a sign that one's concern is being expressed in one's body more adequately than it had been before. . . Pleasure is predatory." 30 Perception is discriminated as a "response to a distant object through the agency of a sense organ" rather than through the vague sensitivity of the body as a whole; apparently perception does not occur without an interest. And the role of consciousness, functionally speaking, seems to be to bring highly relevant spon taneous responses to bear upon the tensional situation?and thus to secure a "free" response. Although Weiss makes no deferential remarks directed toward the patent rights of various functionalists, the reader does think at this point of the cluster of ideas associated with the instrumentalists' phrase, "creative intelligence." Weiss's emphasis is that consciousness (which arose "because the body resists a sensitivity") "is a means by which an ineffective sensi tivity becomes effective once again" (p. 116). There is presumably more psychical apparatus being deployed in Weiss's account of man than in that of the more behaviorally minded pragmatists; but it is appropriate to recall on occasion that Tufts, Dewey and Stuart recognized the emergence and reconstruction of ends as well as the adaptive action of habit-intelligence in service to presiding goals. *? p. 107. Strangely, ecstasy is declared a harbinger of death no less than anguish; perhaps this is hyperbole for saying that traumatic expe riences are stimuli for starting beings on new careers (pp. 116 f.).</page><page sequence="12">WEISS'S DOCTRINE OF CONCERN 339 Space does not permit even the briefest sketch of Weiss's account of the organs, reflexes, instincts, habits (including the use of signs), emotions, will, intelligence and mind.31 With a 21 It may however, be useful to devote a footnote to some highly condensed remarks upon signs and upon mind. "Because a concern is expressed in the body, there is life in that body, and eventually habits and techniques" (p. 164). Among the techniques which Weiss recounts is the employment of signs, upon which he makes a number of interesting definitions and assertions (cf. Ch. IX). However, he strangely says: "Man's ability to use signs, verbal or nonverbal, provides no clue to the existence or nature of his mind" (p. 193). The basic orientation, of the discussion seems to exhibit that "futurism" which is supposedly a pragmatic characteristic. "A sign is any entity, the acknowl edgement of which prompts one to attend to something else" (p. 166). "A sign signifies something general, indeterminate, the future as it now is" (p. 167). "The object of every sign is thus a part of the future. . . A sign is referred to an object through the medium of an expectation, bodily or nonbodily" (p. 168). But Weiss amuses himself at the aspect of Mead's theory whereby the lion's roar must scare the lion a little (p. 181). Cries, calls and words are to be distinguished. "Vocal occurrences are outcries." Calls are "vocal salutations accompanying signs of expected possible acts of others" (p. 178). "We cry out at things, call to animals, and use words with men." Although the same sounds might be used, the sign-functions are of course radically distinct (p. 179). The ability "to use signs with intelligence" is "the result of a high-grade ability to be sensitive to the concerns and objectives of others" (p. 177). Of particular interest is his discussion of "metaphysicals"?terms which indicate what it is to which a complete expression is to be referred. They may be nouns, conjunctions, verbs, metaphors, etc. They convey universes of discourse (p. 183 f.). Mind presupposes intelligence. Intelligence is said to be the ability to relate what is perceived to what is sensitively discerned. Minds are not inherited; each man must acquire his own (p. 204). They are usually acquired in infancy, and can be acquired only in society, for they require at once vital social sharing and intellectual independence. With mind, what is "sensitively discerned is treated as having a different weight for others than it has for us. . . A mind is man's reward for being faithful to his own intelligence while living as a vital member of a group" (p. 207). There are levels of mind. The infant learns to "treat perceived beings, in whose concerns it does not vitally participate, as beings concerned with what it expects" (p. 208). The scientific, the artistic, the philosophic minds emerge as the diversity of experience "drives the individual," under pain of internal division, "to find a higher ground in terms of which he can bring the separated items together" (p. 211). The object of the philosophic mind is "the unitary truth which all beings and activities exhibit," which seems to be, basically, that "every actuality is finite and is concerned with a possible future good (p. 210). "The work of mind is inference"?and</page><page sequence="13">340 ROBERT W. BROWNING discussion of the concept of mind and of the notion of the self, one moves above the animal level. Possession of a psyche is not distinctive to man; animals ?apparently all animals?have psyches. Psyches are "unified feelings, correlates of pleasurable and painful objects," and are existent only when conscious (p. 119). Possession of a self, however, is denied to animals. The focal summary point is that living beings are distinguished from the inanimate by the character of their concern; and selves are distinguished from animal psyches by the character of their concern. Although the "frustration" of inanimate things some times results in living beings, and although a self comes to be in the natural course of things, it would be difficult to exaggerate the significance of these leaps. With life there has emerged a con cern for offspring and kind (presumably this holds for vegetable as well as animal life) ; with the self there has emerged a "concern for an all-embracing good." 22 IV A "human" embryo is started by the "concerned cells" of the parents; it is at first a "low-grade living being" but becomes "a new type of being, a being with a psyche" when it becomes conscious (p. 143). But, due to the growth of the body, it ?whatever the "it" is?is forced almost immediately to change its concern, which it does, with a degree of uniformity which would seem surprising to us, by achieving selfhood. It becomes a being able to "use its body for non-bodily ends." "The change is from a concern directed to the good of the individual or its kind inference is conceived very broadly to include all termini of mental activities, using "countless contingent principles," so-called "necessary inference" being an "ideal rather than a fact" (pp. 211 ff.). 23 P. 253. "The subhuman are unconcerned with what other beings need in order to be perfected. . . It is of the essence of man, in contrast, to endeavor to help all others to be as perfect as possible in consonance with the perfection of the rest. . ." (p. 264).</page><page sequence="14">WEISS'S DOCTRINE OF CONCERN 341 to a concern directed to a good pertinent to other beings as well" (p. 144) Weiss considers as similar the questions, "How did man first arise?" and "How does an individual come to be?". "Unless men were nothing more than animals the bodies of the first human embryos must have resisted their concerns in ways which the bodies of previous embryos did not. " The resistance "forced those concerns to change" and, consequently, the embryos "matured as previous embryos could not" (p. 140). Freedom was exhibited in the change. In view of this account of how we become men, one might express (though one's basis for estimate must be very rough) surprise that foetal acts of freedom do not produce many more sports and monsters. People do not impress one as very adventurous when they are older; yet statistically they must have, by and large, been highly "free" when "they" were animal bodies, although happily this freedom is usually exercised in a similar direc tion.23 I am in sympathy with Weiss's expressions in which idiots are spoken of as "unfortunate," but on Weiss's own basis it is not clear that he should so refer to them. It would be plausible for him to assert that idiocy is due to a grossly deficient employment of one's freedom, or to an atavistic response to challenge, particularly when "one" was foetal or embryonic. There is, to be sure, a theory current in psychiatry that some feeblemindedness is a regressive response rather than a symptom of deficient endow ment. It is interesting that Weiss wishes to treat man as "natural," but is anxious not to class him as an "animal." After rightly observing that man's animal origin does not entail that "he is nothing but an animal," he declares: "It is possible for an animal to become a man, though a man is not and cannot become an animal" (p. 124). Again: "Man cannot be an animal in whole 23 The doctrine is not clear to me here. Much of Nature and Man suggests the real free adventure of each foetus, each embryo, each infant. In Man's Freedom, Weiss on one occasion remarks that man's existence is due to "the effort of an ape-like being which in the face of hindrances once made itself subject to a possibility more comprehensive than those which it had ever faced" (p. 24; italics added).</page><page sequence="15">342 ROBERT W. BROWNING or in part." This surprising Statement is predicated upon affirmation of the hypothesis that man's body is "nonanimal in nature" since it is "quickened by a single human power" (p. 128). Weiss reviews many apparent differences between man and (other) animals, but most of these fail to mark man as "a radically distinct type of being" in accord with the criterion that "one type of being differs from another by virtue of a capacity which all its members and no other beings have." 24 To elucidate the "essential" nature of man, he cannot resort to specific abilities, "for then idiots and children would not be human," but to "a single power which is the source of these diverse abilities." a* As he had done in Reality, he follows the clue of personal identity. There he found that identity could not be defined in terms of the body, nor yet in terms of the mind (pp. 248 f.). Then he plausibly (though fallaciously, since he neglected the possibility of defining it in terms of a psycho-physical combination) argued: "If refuge is not to be taken in a transcendent spirit indifferent to the passage of time. . . there is but the alternative of acknowledging some third factor. . ." (p. 250). In Nature and Man it is made explicit not only that there must be some constant factor,36 but that this factor is to be called the "self." "A man is not a body," but a body is said to be "necessary" as well as "desirable" (p. 133). Neither reason nor memory nor will is the constant sought; the constant is the self which underlies all three (p. 138). Selves are "neither momentary nor non-temporal substances," for we know that we are both constant and that we change.87 34 P. 125. Since actual performance is depreciated, one fails to see why Weiss is so sure that, if a dog does not have a capacity to talk, neverthe less an idiot does, or that, if an idiot does have the capacity to talk, a dog does not. 25 P. 127. He urges, "Everyone has at least a dim awareness of the fact that the child is merely too young and the idiot too unfortunate to be able to bring their singularly human power to adequate expression." 26 "All changes presuppose something constant. Either, then, men are but passing shadows across the face of some more constant thing, or there is within them a constant factor which is expressed as a fluctuating life in a changing body. But men act on their own and are self-same throughout their careers" (Nature and Man, p. 136). 27 P. 135. He continues: "A man is guilty of a crime he committed</page><page sequence="16">WEISS'S DOCTRINE OF CONCERN 343 The self, Weiss argues, is not a body, for it is not located in space, does not have bulk, and is not limited to the performance of physical actions (p. 241). Nor is it a state of the body as a whole at a moment of time, for then there would be no self identity and no control of the body by the self. Nor is it a form for the body, unless this form be ascribed a "being and status of its own," for self-discipline and self-criticism require a self with some degree of independence and with the non-bodily power of knowing (p. 243). Animals have psyches, man has a self. The animal's concern can express itself adequately as a bodily power; man's concern, however, can never be adequately expressed in his body. Being "too rich" for his body, the object of his concern has required "the use of at least a mind and a will" (p. 140). When selfhood is achieved there is capacity to use the body for the promotion of "what ought to be realized" (p. 144). Even a baby or an idiot "is concerned with some goods that do good neither to him nor even to mankind" (p. 138). It would seem to us to be an empirical question whether Mrs. A and Mr. B and Infant C and Idiot D each have a concern of the sort ascribed. Can it be shown that all who are considered to be selves are, as a matter of fact or as a matter of probable theory, concerned with realizing "a good pertinent to others," and that our pets are never concerned with a good beyond their species? One suspects that Weiss will at least have to endorse a doctrine of man's real will, or real concern, as distinct from actual concerns, in the face of some of the phenomena. If?and this hypothesis is to be held open and to receive discussion lateii?Weiss does hold that all men have a real altruistic concern for other kinds of beings, then it is incidentally a little surprising that a writer who is so generous in his estimate of man is not apparently ready to exhibit a similar generosity in his estimate of the motivations of some animals. To be sure, a sensible naturalist is not an arbitrary reductionist, and does aim to deny no distinctions that he finds; still one has a feeling that perchance Weiss is a bit more a year ago. His guilt is not decreased but in fact increased if he changes his face and fingerprints in the meantime."</page><page sequence="17">344 ROBERT W. BROWNING zealous in guarding his distinction between man and animal than a "naturalist" ought to be. If a self is defined as an interested being concerned with goods beyond its own species, one must, as we see it, at least be prepared for the contingent possibility that, pathetically, some biological descendants of human beings are not selves, and for the possibility that eddies of evolution in other than the human current may produce selves. An apriorism concerning fact and a rigidity ?allegedly Aristotelian?concerning species would ill fit the pro ponent of an epochalism at this point. It would seem more like a "naturalistic" and "epochal" theory if selfhood were talked of as a potentiality of most men?and a potentiality which we find it desirable morally and (usually) legally to assume to be present in all "human" cases, even though we do not have good evidence that it is always a real potentiality. In view of the facts of generation, as well as in deference to human sentiment, it is easier to draw the line between biological species than to draw it somewhere in the human species. But this sort of pragmatic justification of the ascription of universal human rights (even though our legal and medical institutions cannot wholly embody them) is not the way of Weiss, who takes in his new terminology the more traditional outlook. One may like the good old moral notions, but one is not quite sure of their ontological grounding. If, however, a critic objects that Weiss or any epochalist is not entitled to speak about "natures," it is to be observed that?uni lateral impositions of certain empirical criteria of meaning to one side?the objection does not hold. Adherents of emergence may legitimately talk about the "nature of a species" or the "nature of man." By their promulgation of so general an "epochalism" they are not thereby inconsistently committed to asserting a material fixity of species in the world; the implication of their phraseology can be satisfied by a present relative stability of species. On the provision of presuming a considerable continuity of a core of proximate defining traits?a "core" which may itself undergo partial modification?one may speak, for instance, of human nature "changing," not just in the sense in which the manifestations of actual (conditioned or "cooked") human nature are altered through learning, but also in the inner or native</page><page sequence="18">WEISS'S DOCTRINE OF CONCERN 345 meaning, pertaining to real (or "raw") human nature. To be sure, one would be bound for purposes of careful theory to go beyond a proximate listing and finally to specify what essential characters of a core?or what alternative cores*?define human nature; then one would be conceptually equipped to answer the question of when human nature emerged, and would also be formally prepared to answer the question of when human nature evolves or devolves out of itself into something else. It is to be admitted that the latter contingency has evoked, as far as I know, no anticipatory deployment from Weiss. Doubtless the few citations which have been given excite a number of questions; let the reader be assured that a closer perusal of the text generates a host more. There are, first, the ranges of queries in pursuit of the evidence for the doctrine of "concern" in general and for the theory of the "self" in particular. Secondly, there are, from the sympathetic reader, demands for a great number of clarifications as to the inner structure of the theory. Articulations of the latter would undoubtedly induce a proliferation of the former. Space does not permit our running through the permutations and combinations of the questions con cerning details held and types of support for holding them. The preliminary portion of the doctrine of the self, which maintains that selves are "neither momentary nor non-temporal substances," nor states of the body as a whole at a moment of time, seems not out of accord with common sense. For this cause and for better reasons, it is credible. Weiss has here put forth considerable weighty argument, although it is given in capsule form. Selves are not momentary, and selves do engage in "self-discipline" and "self-criticism." It is quite appropriate to appeal to, and to attempt to develop, what is involved in selves as beings that do science, are responsible agents and are lovers. Of course, whether some knowings are bodily powers, or whether all knowing is a "nonbodily power" will depend in part upon one's definitions of knowledge and of body. And so, mutatis mutandis, for some other considerations. The portion of the theory of the self which goes on to invoke definition in terms of its alleged characteristic concern cannot be</page><page sequence="19">346 ROBERT W. BROWNING profitably discussed further until we come into possession of a more adequate comprehension of the definiens. Surely Weiss is engaging in a proper and highly significant activity in seeking for the distinctive characters of man. Surely he is right that, owing to the success of natural and biological sciences, habits are extant which tend to ignore some of the data and to "reduce" man. Weiss has cautioned against both reduc tionism and its polar fallacy which he labels "unwarranted addi tion." He intimates that the latter has much better moral effects, but is equally bad intellectually. We have not concealed a sus picion that Weiss himself is guilty of "unwarranted addition" in attributing not minds 28 but "concerns" to inanimate entities. One might suggest tentatively that Weiss ought to: (1) scrap the application of concern to inanimate entities, until there is some positive evidence in support (unless, indeed, the term is going to be made to stand for some relation like "possibility of having a causal transaction with") ; (2) discriminate actual con cerns as specified sorts of behavior-tension s and conscious mental sets ?9 towards certain signs and possibilities; and (3) distinguish such actual concerns from domains of concerns, which may characterize a species. This is suggested on some such analogy as "attention" affords; there are acts of attention, which select from a larger field of possible attention. Indeed, one needs conveniently to distinguish a valuing being's conscious valuations at a moment from his dispositional valuations or interests which may lie momentarily latent; and one needs to separate both of these from the quantitative regions and the qualitative realms of values which typify a species. The domains of concerns will be functions of urges, sensitivities and powers; the "effective environ ment" of most species?one remembers James's dog in his master's 28 Panpsychism?moved "by the laudable desire to avoid the deep dualisms which have made mysteries of the union of mind and body and of the origin of life and thought"'?"attributes minds, feelings and life to atoms, rocks, oceans and stars" and thus commits the "error of unwarranted addition" in "loading down the rest of nature with human characters there is no reason to believe it possesses" (Nature and Man, p. xvi). 29 I am frankly embarrassed as to how one should deal with apparent telic behavior in plants, with tropisms, etc.</page><page sequence="20">WEISS'S DOCTRINE OF CONCERN 347 library?is far smaller than the total cosmic environment; and one may use the extent of the ranges of such regions as a rough index of?or, indeed, as definitionally indicative of?the "level" of a species in the evolutionary and valuational hierarchy. If Weiss wishes to say with Plato, Aristotle and various mystics that man has some capacity (as manifested by a few men) of referring to, and wanting to comprehend or become acquainted with, the total environment, we can go along. V However, it is plain enough that Weiss is working toward the articulation of a more strategic metaphysical notion than is entertained in these desultory recommendations; and it is more fitting that we address ourselves to what Weiss does mean than to instructing him on how we would have simplified and neglected his business. The task is not easy. One can, however, tenaciously raise certain questions against a textual background; in addition, one may proffer certain distinctions which may aid communica tion. If a "concern" is a being's way of reaching into the future, I find myself very ignorant of the concerns of most beings. Of course, I should like to testify for the edification of any old fashioned strict behaviorists that I do live through felt concerns and do infer that other human beings undergo like experiences. Mr. Smith is concerned with how to meet his bills, is concerned with a new opportunity, is concerned with his children's education, is concerned with the stability of his nation or of the world. In these instances, there is always some awareness of one's solicitude ?whether it be an excitement about a pleasing prospect or an anxiety about unfavorable portents. Now one trusts that this familiar meaning goes a way in illuminating Weiss's meaning of "concern"; for it conveys the future reference and the present dynamism of orientation to prospects which are value-charged. However, the meanings are not equivalent, perhaps because the familiar use sometimes denotes</page><page sequence="21">348 ROBERT W. BROWNING fears of evils 30 and because it always (unless amended by some acquaintance with depth psychology) includes occasions with some degree of conscious awareness?whereas Weiss's need not. For our author's application of the general category goes far beyond the higher animals. Moreover, at least some of his allegations about man universally would be empirically false if such an inter pretation were made, and it is much more sensible to attribute a wider meaning than to ascribe material falsity to the account of our philosopher. Indeed, perhaps it would be appropriate to ask: Must concern remain behind the scenes, unconscious? Both Weiss and Whitehead apply the concept far beyond the conscious human context. However, its concrete specifications presumably become conscious in intentional devotion to objectives; and the philosophical anthropologist at least attempts to raise the source or sources of motivation into discursive consciousness if not into direct awareness. In so far as we claim empirically to discriminate or infer the concerns of other men, it is not plain to us that all men's actual concerns are such as take account of all things and of their possible futures in an all-comprehensive future. The most that could be urged with confidence is that these selves never know when some new factor may not prove to be relevant to their actual concerns or future concerns, that by the principle of the connectedness of nature they are "involved" with things they do not now know, and that consequently they had better take more account explicitly of what is thus implicit. If the "concern" covers every way of thus being "involved," and is not restricted to habit, physical "set," disposition and explicit consciousness, then speculatively one may ask whether other beings than men are not ultimately concerned with everything. A Spinoza would argue for a sense in which all the items of "nature natured" are necessarily and wholly involved. Other thinkers, 30 One wonders if Weiss's usage includes "concern" lest evils happen, or whether concern, as such, is only directed to goods, whatever emotional accompaniments may attend frustration. Much of his theory of value would suggest that all evil is only privation of good. However, one does note that not only are there natural evils (Man's Freedom, p. 248), but that bad will is possible (ibid., p. 237).</page><page sequence="22">WEISS'S DOCTRINE OF CONCERN 349 holding to the idea of temporally isolated causal chains, would urge a meaning in which involvement does not obtain with respect to y when x appears and disappears without positive connection with it. The discussion then becomes a retail project of the special sciences; but we would now be prepared to acknowledge that a normal man is involved more extensively in circumambient nature than is a dog in the sense that he interprets a much wider range of stimuli, and that the man is less embedded in nature than the dog in the sense that he can play more strands of causation upon other strands to avoid or secure even remotely envisaged outcomes. I am unclear as to how concerns are known, how (if they be actualities) they arise, and what they are. I do not know for sure whether some of them or all of them are disclosed as relatively complete actualities of direct experience, or are abstracted aspects of observed behaviors, or are constructs of scientific hypothesizing, or are posited on very general systematic ground. One may wonder whether a concern is held to be the "nature" of an entity, the dynamic aspect of an entity, some directional aspect of its vectors, or what. Should statements of concerns be framed as laws of dynamics and of motivation? If inanimate things have concerns and if a concern is the way a thing has of reaching from the present into the future, it may seem plausible that a being's concern is identical with the whole striving or dynamic aspect of a thing, although not with its whole nature. "Things have natures so far as they allow for some occurrences and preclude others." 31 Then "nature" could be used with respect to an entity inclusively to name both the positive aspect of concern and the resistant recalcitrant aspect. However, one will not invest much confidence in this line of thought, not only on grounds of doubt whether such a distinction of positive and negative properties can be carried through, but because Weiss may be read as intimating that a thing's "resistance" expresses its con cern as much as does its "insistence." S2 The inquirer would also wish to know the relation of concern to?as cause or effect of, matrix of, emergent from, or even in 31 Man's Freedom, p. 18. 32 Nature and Man, p. 56; cf. pp. 45 ff.</page><page sequence="23">350 ROBERT W. BROWNING contrasting independence of?affective tone, desire, expectation, interests, dispositions. One may read Reality as suggesting that concern be viewed as some sort of tensional relation which affective tone takes toward "items outside the reach of the senses." Inevitable insatiation or partial frustration is intimated as the source of exploration and inquiry (one does not know the counter part of these in the activity of "lower" entities). However, the dis cussion is not simply biologically practical in orientation with respect to man; perhaps there are even overtones of mysticism in which the "interrelated whole of reality" is "an appropriate counterpart" of the "unexpressed core" of a being; the fine arts are definitely ascribed to the attempt to reproduce "in more favorable media" what is deeply felt but dimly apprehended in the "field of stimulation." 3S One is not sure whether concern is here confined to a tensional response to what is beyond the reach of the senses; one supposes Weiss's later teaching to have no such restriction, although concern is dynamic reference to where dynamism moves?into the future. What is the relation, in the case of a man, between his concern and his "expectations"? Probably this, that expectations aid one in specializing a concern.34 What is the relation of concern to "interests"? Weiss's own definition of interests is a peculiar one; interests are selected dispositions charged with "spontaneity" and "made flexible"; they convert the objects of disposition into "bounding parts of us" thereby "limiting our expectations." s5 Man's concern is certainly wider than his actual interests; possibly it is coextensive with the whole domain of his possible interests; probably it extends farther and denominates the whole realm of his possible dispositions. An actual disposition "is a bias delimited in reference to but a few contemporaries; it is a bias quickened not by the all-comprehensive possibility but by an expected situational version of it." 36 It might seem that our "dispositions" are ways of deploying energies in moving into the 83 Reality, pp. 283 f. 34 Man's Freedom, p. 169. 35 Ibid., pp. 170 f. 36 Ibid., p. 170.</page><page sequence="24">WEISS'S DOCTRINE OF CONCERN 351 future. Yet it will hardly do to say that a concern is a solicitous way of reaching into the abstract future and dispositions are ways of concretely reaching into a more definite future, for?sometimes at least?man's concern suggests an impartial universality which used to go with the idea of "reason," whereas a disposition is a bias. Perhaps Weiss means to treat dispositions as moving specifications of active selves with static concerns. Possibly, however, a disposition is an animal reaction (reaction of the psyche) to situational factors, and man's concern, in contrast, determines a supra-animal reaction, resident somehow in the emergent self. VI If one encounters difficulty in getting clear one neat con sistent doctrine of concern, still one had better be very hesitant about positively affirming inconsistency, for there is much ma chinery around for making distinctions which can be used for effecting reconciliations, e.g., such possible distinctions as (a) conscious vs. unconscious concern, (b) native vs. learned concern, (c) ideal vs. actual concern, (d) real vs. apparent concern, and (e) universal general vs. specified concern. In addition, we have suggested a distinction between actual concerns of an entity and domains of concerns which are characteristic of a species. If he will use them, Weiss will find no dearth of handles for setting his furniture in an orderly pattern, although one may still be dis tressed by the awesome complexities of the phenomena. Brief attention has already been directed to the fact (a) that concerns are held to exist in non-conscious entities and that in some form certain concerns do become conscious. Texts, however, are troublesome over (b), whether or not concerns may be acquired and expanded in a learning process. Most of our author's discussions sound as if?apart from the mutation wherein the new concern emerges?the concern is a constant, existing wherever the species exists, it being part of the defining essence of that species. Nevertheless, a few passages speak not only as if ontogeny were recapitulating phylogeny in each entity's becom</page><page sequence="25">352 ROBERT W. BROWNING ing a member of its species, but as if the live concrete human being were continually effecting small mutations of its concern in its process of "self-education." "Every one of us is not only helped but blocked by others .... To meet such frustrations we try to concern ourselves with more comprehensive possibilities than we did before. If we succeed we will be able to act from within in ways which take more adequate account of what frustrates us from without. We will change our concerns, evolve." 37 One aspiring to be an educated man is counselled "to learn ... to internalize" the absolute good, "for only in this way can he con dition himself adequately by what controls him." 38 Most of the time however, the discussion probably sounds to the reader as if the moral learning that takes place is not a process of changing the concern (which is always constant) but is something else, such as the progressive mastery of the body by the concern.39 Some times, in compromise phrasings, the sense of universal respon sibility is treated as an "hypothesis"?but as an "inescapable" one ?of the creative moral self. Perhaps the passages which represent men as already con cerned with an all-comprehensive possibility and those?not infrequently in close proximity to the former?which represent men as being jogged progressively to move toward it are to be reconciled by some such distinction as that between implicit and explicit, latent and overt, or potential and actual. Man has to learn his proper end; like Augustine and Faust, he may make many false starts, although he is never completely in the dark and is led by some light. Such an interpretation banks upon the validity of distinction (c) or (d). "Unknowingly, unconsciously, privately, and steadily, from birth to death" man is said to have the most general of possibilities "in steady focus." 40 Apart from some pre established mechanism which one feels is surely irrelevant, to assert that something is unconsciously held "in steady focus" sounds uncommon to the ear. Likewise it seems odd?in addition 37 Man's Freedom, pp. 23 f. 38 Ibid., p. 89. 39 E.g., Nature and Man, pp. 139 f. 40 Man's Freedom, p. 24.</page><page sequence="26">WEISS'S DOCTRINE OF CONCERN 353 to the overtones of reification?to refer to selves as unconsciously clinging to the all-comprehensive possibility as their defining essence. Presumably this is an alternative locution for affirming the inalienable distinctive moral freedom of selves. (Of course, it is not at all strange to say that something unconscious is steadily present. Indeed, one recalls familiar facts regarding attention, and the observation of Peirce, which is also a perennial theme of Whitehead, that the ubiquitous greater generalities are more dif ficult of apprehension.) Probably the solution of questions about distinction (b) will have relation to distinctions (c), (d), and (e), if these are em ployed, and may further bear upon the egoism-altruism polarity, since a normally developing human being might be said to move from preoccupations which are dominantly egoistic toward a genuine sociality. Distinctions (c) and (d)? ideal vs. actual concern 41 and real vs. apparent concern,42 respectively? can serve more clearly to bring out the normative property of the doctrine. If concern is constituted by, or is a direct function of what would express man's nature or what would fulfill and satisfy man, it is plausible that each individual Faust is experimenting in life with various "apparent" goods in trying to find his "real" object. One might also make a social application with respect to the course of human 41 Is concern the posited and ideal resultant of a given multiplicity of drives rendered harmonious? Is its unity that of a distributive need, like that of individual men in Hobbes and like that of individual passions in Santayana, resulting in a "social contract" or "reason"? Or?as seems textually more likely? is concern held to be antecedently unitary? 42 Weiss refers to man's "true concern" for the all-comprehensive possibility. If this be its proper object, one does not suppose that the concern is exhaustively constituted by a wertfrei intellectual apprehension of logical possibility. Perhaps the entertainment of such possibility is the primary form of man's recognition of his freedom, but on systematic grounds?including Weiss's too facile assimilation of the future to the good?one hazards the assumption that man's concern contains also springs of some sort of positive passion for the realization of value. However, the obscurity of the sense in which this ur-disposition is impartial, and of the sense in which it objective is universal, if any, is a matter for current complaint.</page><page sequence="27">354 ROBERT W. BROWNING history, as objective idealists and James have done; 4S men col lectively have been pushing, thrusting, fighting and dreaming to find an adequately fulfilling way of living together. The distinc tion of real vs. apparent concern is useful for parading the correc tive effects of experience to which allusion has been made, and for plausibly exhibiting a sense in which Weiss holds that the creative good life is its own reward and sanction. Distinction (e)?that between an indeterminate all-com prehensive possibility and less indeterminate possibilities which are specifications of the former?is explicitly made, and repeatedly used, by Weiss. The general idea of this procedure seems quite legitimate and?in the present milieu?important. Indeed, the notions of general regulative ideals, like "the truth" and "the good," meaningful but empty of concrete content, seem to me to have a role in cognition and practice?though, to be sure, only a latent functional role; yet some pragmatists in epistemology and some empiricists in morals seem to have supposed it to be their functional duty to attempt to erase these vague formal meanings out of deference to the sovereignty of denotable methods, proce dures, psychical contents and social institutions. The distinction is important to Weiss in a further sense. With the multiplicity of perspectives of his windowed monads, the idea of specification of a universal is apparently employed as a way to bridge the gap between the "good" as a common universal 4a With a vivid sense of the "unshareable material or social prizes" and of the "exuberant mass of goods with which all human nature is in travail, and groaning to bring to the light of day," James nevertheless manifested an optimism at least equivalent to that of the appreciative traditionalist: "... society has shaken itself into one sort of relative equi librium after another by a series of social discoveries quite analogous to those of science. Polyandry and polygamy and slavery, private warfare and liberty to kill, judicial torture and arbitrary royal power have slowly suc cumbed to actually aroused complaints; and though some one's ideals are unquestionably the worse off for each improvement, yet a vastly greater total number of them find shelter in our civilized society than in the older savage ways." The unbroken struggle between conservatives and various radicals is "simply deciding through actual experiment by what sort of conduct the maximum amount of good can be gained and kept in this world." From "The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life," Essays in Faith and Morals (New York, 1947), pp. 198, 204 ff.</page><page sequence="28">WEISS'S DOCTRINE OF CONCERN 355 of their respective vistas upon the future and a particular good policy enacted by a specific agent, adopted in accord with his own provincial lights. The theory of perspectives, whether in Leibniz, Whitehead or Mead, is recondite, although we feel that we derive some glimmers of insight into the meaning of sociality therefrom; however, here also we encounter certain difficulties. The com monness of the unspecified or empty universal does not necessarily spell genuine mutuality. If all the content is egoistic when spe cification is made, then conflict is not removed by noting that the disparate objectives are pursued under the form of the good. Besides re-emphasizing the importance of determining the character and objectives of man's concern, this gives one pause about referring to what allegedly must be biased as a "spe cification" of what must be unbiased, the greatest possible good.44 The biased is not a specification of the impartial. In reading Man's Freedom, we seem to find two quite dif ferent ethical systems. The first leads dialectically into the second, but one may arrest it for discussion before the transition is made. Let the first be called the "ethics of consistent policy." It allows the agent freedom to choose his ultimate end, imposing only practical consistency upon him; conscientiousness is con ceived as consistency with one's previous commitments, whatever these may be. Now one feels that one understands how a doctrine of distorting perspectives may fit congruently with the "ethics of consistent policy." But one may make the old-fashioned sug gestion that the object of the moral man's deliberate concern is not just any all-comprehensive possibility but the best all-com prehensive possibility, or any of those which are equally in the best discernible category of ultimate ends. The advocacy of this latter we suppose to be the teaching of Weiss's eventual ethics. In it the ultimate end is assigned by man's vocation. One does not readily find how the thesis of distorting perspectives is rendered 44 E.g., Man's Freedom, p. 167. In what sense is our concern genuinely directed to the ultimate good when we have so distorted it as to "make it take a shape which is singularly pertinent to ourselves and the limited things which interest us . . ."? Does not the doctrine of such a concern become a doctrine of a hidden "real will" (or real concern) as against our "actual will" (or actual concern)?</page><page sequence="29">356 ROBERT W. BROWNING coherent with this normative ethics. To be sure, Weiss does have a doctrine of guilt?of inevitable guilt?and perhaps man bears the incoherence with this brand of Cain. VII Let us now focus upon some of the many questions which have been suggested or asked above. 1. What evidence is there for concern in the sub-animal realms, especially in the region of the inanimate? (This is acute, since apparently Weiss wishes to affirm more of a distinction between the living and the non-living than Whitehead evinced, and is expressly wary of extending anthropomorphic patterns downward.) 2. What is the evidence for man's alleged concern? The doctrine is (apparently) inferentially posited and is not a sum of the phenomena of apprehensiveness, eagerness, worry, tension, ambi tion, tenacity, loyalty, etc. 3. At least with respect to the dynamism of the higher an imals, does Weiss not make?or need to make?a distinction be tween apparent actual concern and implicit real concern, somewhat as idealists distinguished actual will and real will? 4. Did man become man all at once or does each embryo (biologically derived from human parents) have to become a man by the exercise of its own freedom in the direction of the enlarge ment of its own pre-human concern? 5. In view of the account of the emergence of selves, is it not strange that more "human" embryos do not fail to become selves? Why do not occasional embryos of anthropoid apes employ their freedom to become selves? 6. Is it perchance by definition that a self is said to have a concern for the perfection of all beings? Is it then conceded that many beings who are ordinarily called "selves" are not selves, and that conceivably the definition lacks exemplification in fact.</page><page sequence="30">WEISS'S DOCTRINE OF CONCERN 357 7. Is the doctrine of human concern empirically grounded on what a few men seem capable of reaching for? Are the capa cities of some persons good evidence for the capacities of others? e.g., of idiots?and good ground for the obligations of these others ? 8. How is the doctrine of distorting perspectives related to man's permanent obligation to the absolute good?his obligation to effect the maximal perfection of all other beings as well as of himself? 9. How is (static?) concern related to the dynamic aspect of a thing, and to the whole nature of the thing? 10. What is the matrix relation, or other relation, of con cern to affective tone, desire, expectation, interests, dispositions, sentiments? 11. How general or how specific is a concern of a species supposed to be? How general or how specific is the concern of an individual? 12. Does each individual have a presiding concern in com mon with all other members of the species? Does he have a unique instantiation, specification, or realization of it? Does he have different specifications of it at different phases of his career, when dominated by different purposes and even during different complete acts? 13. Is one farther removed from a proper approach to the notion of human and animal concern if he conceives it as an energy needing discharge than if he envisages it as the conditions of ful filling a being's nature, or than if, in turn, he pictures it as a response to a lure? 14. If man's concern, or its object, is something upon which men "focus," is it an unconsciously held ideal? Does philosophy have the role of a midwife to bring it to consciousness? 15. Can human concern be educated, or is it a constant? Can conscious specifications of concern be corrected? What are the tests of satisfactoriness and unsatisfactoriness ?</page><page sequence="31">358 ROBERT W. BROWNING I have assumed that a concern need not have a highly specified material content but that at least it is not totally amorphous with respect to what it requires for fulfillment. (If any beings run into "frustration," surely there must be some definiteness to the form or objects of their tension.) Is the frustration of concern only a dam against the release of energies or of drives which are con ceived as totally indifferent to the form that the release takes? I think not. Presumably there are satisfactory forms of expression ?and unsatisfactory discharges?even if the forms of satisfactori ness are highly general. If man's concern is simply an apprehen sion of a universal which remains ever empty, the trend of this interpretation is in error. Admittedly the concrete objects of here and now enter only derivatively and as specific materials in the actual deployment of vector forces in accord with policy, but presumably the forces have ideal ends in the shape of what would be really satisfactory. A normative role of concern is then assured. One would like a more detailed treatment of the relation of con cern to the formal and material aspects of motivation. Perhaps Weiss will provide such a treatment of human psychology in the future. Northwestern University.</page></plain_text>
