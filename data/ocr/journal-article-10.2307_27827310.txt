<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERE AND THERE By the Board of Editors and the Membership of the Sigma XI RESA Societies With the first issue of 1959 {March) the Editors decided to inaugurate a feature dedicated to the publication of interesting quotations from both current and older books. In this way we hope to do more for our readers than is possible through the Scientists' Bookshelf, giving them some of the actual flavor of a book that a review cannot easily convey. The existence of this feature will offer to all the membership an opportunity to bring to the notice of fellow-members passages from their readings which they deem of particular interest. The Editors will be glad to receive suggested passages, typed double-spaced, with the name of the book, the author's name, the location of the quote (page number) and the publisher of the book. The Board of Editors will undertake to secure, if possible, from the publishers the necessary permission to publish such excerpts as are selected for use. The Editors and others submit the following excerpts from recent works as ex amples of what they have in mind. Contributors7 names are italicized. In The American High School Today, Copyright (c) 1959 by James Bryant Conant, published by the McGraw-Hill Book Company, 330 West 42nd Street, New York, New York, $1.00, the author, on page 40, concludes : "The number of small high schools must be drastically reduced through district reorganization. Aside from this important change, I believe no radical alteration in the basic pattern of American education is necessary in order to improve our public high schools. If all the high schools were functioning as well as some I have visited, the education of all American youth would be satisfactory, except for the study of foreign languages and the guidance of the more able girls. Most of the schools which I found unsatisfactory in one or more respects could be come satisfactory by relatively minor changes, though I have no doubt that there are schools even of sufficient size where major improvements in organization and instruction would be in order. If the fifty-five schools I have visited, all of which have a good reputation, are at all representative of American public high schools, I think one general criticism would be in order: The academically talented student, as a rule, is not being sufficiently challenged, does not work hard enough, and his pro gram of academic subjects is not of sufficient range. The able boys too often specialize in mathematics and science to the exclusion of foreign languages and to the neglect of English and social studies. The able girls, on the other hand, too often 290</page><page sequence="2">HERE AND THERE 291 avoid mathematics and science as well as the foreign languages. A correction of this situation in many instances will depend upon an altered attitude of the community quite as much as upon action by a school board or the school administration." On the duty of citizens in these matters, Dr. Conant writes on page 96 : "I am convinced American secondary education can be made satisfactory without any radical changes in the basic pattern. This can only be done, however, if the citizens in many localities display sufficient interest in their schools and are willing to support them. The improvements must come school by school and be made with due regard for the nature of the community. Therefore, I conclude by addressing this final word to citizens who are concerned with public education : avoid generalizations, recognize the necessity of diversity, get the facts about your local situation, elect a good school board and support the efforts of the board to improve the schools." About bats when they "leave the belfries" and what is the nature of an experiment we learn from the 1959 Copyright (c) of Stanley D. Beck in his The Simplicity of Science, reprinted by permission of Double day &amp; Company, the following interesting views on page 24 : "The bat is the only known mammal that is a true flier. Some other mammals?such as the flying squirrel?can glide, but only the bat flies. Almost everyone has seen the common brown bat as it wends its irregular fluttering flight in the failing light of dusk. The most common species is little bigger than a mouse, and is sometimes known as a 'flittermouse' or a 'fledermaus.' From common observations of bats by many people over hun dreds of years, we know that bats are expert fliers, catching flying insects and eating them on the wing. And yet, it is also known that they have very poor eyesight, a fact which has given rise to the expression 'as blind as a bat.' Bats are famous for their visual shortcomings. But then, they fly only at night when it is too dark to see anyway. They spend daylight hours hanging upside down in a dark cave or hole, wrapped up in their own thin furry wings, presumably sleeping. If bats fly only at night and eat only flying insects, how can they catch the insects if they cannot see them? And, being blind as bats, what prevents their crashing into things like trees, rocks, and buildings? It should be possible to set up experi ments which would yield some information on how bats navi gate with the skill that they show."</page><page sequence="3">292 AMERICAN SCIENTIST Experiment shows that : (page 28-29) : "I. Normal bats can avoid collision while in flight. 2. Normal bats utter frequent shrill cries while in flight. 3. Blinded bats can avoid collision while in flight. 4. Deafened bats do not avoid collisions. 5. Muted bats do not avoid collisions.'' "A logical interpretation of our bat data would be that the bat flies by a biological equivalent of sonar. Sending out short shrill cries, it adjusts its flight direction and behavior according to the echoes it receives from anything?prey or obstacle? which happens to be in the vicinity. This explanation is con sistent with all of the observed facts. It also has the added appeal of being consistent with what is known of the physics of sound waves." Next comes a caveat (page 30) : "There is a temptation to speculate on what the bat experi ences, how it lives in a world of echoes, how it identifies objects by how sounds bounce off them, how it is unaware of the world of colors and lights, and how it 'sees' with its ears. Such temp tations must be resisted. They must be resisted because we know nothing of the feelings, impressions, and mental experi ences of bats. In our experiments, we have dealt only with how bats behave. To speculate on these other matters is to ascribe human characteristics to the bat and to try to put our own minds and personalities in the bat. This is called anthropo morphism, and is one of the cardinal sins that may be committed by a scientist. Avoiding anthropomorphism is sometimes difficult, nevertheless. In the interpretation of experiments, in the simple description of behavior, even in the definition of terms we include in a scientific vocabulary, avoiding anthropo morphism is far from easy." On chain reactions Professor Beck writes (page 106) : "A series in which the numbers are doubled each time soon leads to fantastically large numbers. The chain reaction in an atomic bomb involves the release of energy, and the rapid build-up of the energy in a confined space results in a horren dous explosion. The rapid build-up of a chain reaction may be illustrated by a little story about a cowboy and a crafty blacksmith. The cowboy wanted the blacksmith to shoe his horse, but he did not want to spend much money on the operation. After dicker ing over the price and not coming to an agreement, the black</page><page sequence="4">HERE AND THERE 293 smith said, 'Tell ya what. It takes eight nails to put on a shoe. That makes thirty-two nails all together. I'll give you the shoes for free. I'll charge you just two cents for the first nail, four cents for the second, eight for the third. Each nail will cost just twice as much as the one before.' The cowboy agreed to this plan. When the blacksmith finished shoeing the horse, he presented the boy "with the bill." Guess its size! The bill was for $85,899,345.90. The importance in physics of the historical method is the topic discussed by Pierre Duhem in his The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory, translated by Philip P. Wiener, published by Princeton University Press (Copyright 1954). On pages 269-270 we read: "To give the history of a physical principle is at the same time to make a logical analysis of it. The criticism of the intellectual processes that physics puts into play is related indissolubly to the exposition of the gradual evolution by which deduction perfects a theory and makes of it a more precise and better ordered representation of laws revealed by observation. Besides, the history of science alone can keep the physicist from the mad ambitions of dogmatism as well as the despair of Pyrrhonian skepticism. By retracing for him the long series of errors and hesitations preceding the discovery of each principle, it puts him on guard against false evidence; by recalling to him the vicissitudes of the cosmological schools and by exhuming doctrines once triumphant from the oblivion in which they lie, it reminds him that the most attractive systems are only provisional repre sentations, and not definitive explanations. And, on the other hand, by unrolling before him the con tinuous tradition through which the science of each epoch is nourished by the systems of past centuries, through which it is pregnant with the physics of the future; by mentioning to him the predictions that theory has formulated and experiment realized : by these it creates and fortifies in him that conviction that physical theory is not merely an artificial system, suitable today and useless tomorrow, but that it is an increasingly more natural classification and an increasingly clearer reflection of realities which experimental method cannot contemplate directly. Every time the mind of the physicist is on the point of going to some extreme, the study of history rectifies him by means of an appropriate correction. In order to define the role that history plays with respect to the physicist, we may borrow from history the following words of Pascal: "'When he praises</page><page sequence="5">294 AMERICAN SCIENTIST himself, I lower him; when he lowers himself, I praise him.' " History thus maintains him in that state of perfect equilibrium in which he can soundly judge the aim and structure of physical theory." On page 334 Duhem concludes : "When the physicist after submitting his science to . . . careful examination returns into himself, and when he becomes aware of the course of his reasoning, he at once recognizes that all his most powerful and deepest aspirations have been disappointed by the despairing results of his analysis. No, he cannot make up his mind to see in physical theory merely a set of practical procedures and a rack filled with tools. No, he cannot believe that it merely classifies information accumulated by empirical science without transforming in any way the nature of these facts or without impressing on them a character which experi ment alone would not have engraved on it. If there were in physical theory only what his own criticism made him discover in it, he would stop devoting his time and efforts to a work of such meager importance. The study of the method of physics is powerless to disclose to the physicist the reason leading him to construct a physical theory. No physicist, no matter how positivistic, can refuse to admit this. However, his positivism must be very strict, stricter even than that demanded by M. Rey, if he does not go beyond this admission and affirm that his efforts toward a physical theory increasingly more unified and more complete are reasonable, although the logical scrutiny of physical method was not able to discover the reason for it. It will be very difficult for him not to posit this reason in the correctness of the following propositions : Physical theory confers on us a certain knowledge of the external world which is irreducible to merely empirical knowl edge; this knowledge comes neither from experiment nor from the mathematical procedures employed by theory, so that the merely logical dissection of theory cannot discover the fissure through which his knowledge is introduced into the structure of physics; through an avenue whose reality the physicist cannot deny, any more than he can describe its course, this knowl edge derives from a truth other than the truths apt to be possessed by our instruments; the order in which theory arranges the results of observation does not find its adequate and complete justification in its practical or aesthetic charac teristics; we surmise, in addition, that it is or tends to be a</page><page sequence="6">HERE AND THERE 295 natural classification; through an analogy whose nature escapes the confines of physics but whose existence is imposed as certain on the mind of the physicist, we surmise that it corresponds to a certain supremely eminent order. In a word, the physicist is compelled to recognize that it would be unreasonable to work for the progress of physical theory if this theory were not the increasingly better defined and more precise reflection of a metaphysics; the belief in an order transcend ing physics is the sole justification of physical theory. The alternating hostile or favorable attitude that any - physicist takes in regard to this affirmation is summarized in Pascal's words: " 'We have an impotence to prove invincible by any dogmatism, and we have an idea of truth invincible by any skepticism.'"?C. C. Gillispie N. R. Hanson's Patterns of Discovery, An Inquiry into the Conceptual Foundations of Science (1958) tells us on page 158 about intelligibility. We quote with permission of the publisher, Cambridge University Press. "Intelligibility is the goal of physics, the fulfilment of natural philosophy ; for natural philosophy is philosophy of matter, a con tinual conceptual struggle to fit each new observation of phenom ena into a pattern of explanation. Often the pattern precedes the recognition of the phenomenon, as Dirac's theory of 1928 pre ceded the discovery of the positron, the anti-proton and the anti-neutron, and as Pauli's neutrino-hypothesis preceded the actual discovery of the particle by more than a generation. But then Dirac's pattern was itself the issue of an effort to find a suitable explicans for prior phenomena, i.e., a unified, rela tivistically invariant theory of electron spin which would give the correct fine structure formula, the Zeeman effect of the doublet atoms, a description of Compton scattering and a model of the H-atom. This resembles the way in which the anomalous behavior of Mercury at perihelion vexed all New tonians after Leverrier, being made intelligible only in 1915 by general relativity. It is like Newton himself struggling up from Kepler's three laws?apparently distinct and independent? to universal gravitation, which gave these laws a coherence and integrity they never had for Kepler. The planetary-ellipse in its turn had done the same thing for Kepler's thinking about the chaotic heap of Martian data he had inherited from Tycho Brahe ; Kepler's observations of Mars acquired something that those of Brahe and Galileo never had. And for the Galileo of 1638 freely falling bodies were not what they had been for the Galileo of 1604. These were all great advances in physical</page><page sequence="7">296 AMERICAN SCIENTIST science. In principle they are like the advances Tycho and Simplicius would have made had they come to appreciate the sunset as did Kepler and Galileo. 'Though the aether is filled with vibrations the world is dark. But one day man opens his seeing eye, and there is light.' "?C. C. Gillispie How the new synthetic adhesives were applied to an historical object is recorded by Sir Harry Melville in his fact-packed book, Big Molecules, copyright Sir H. Melville 1958, used with permission of The Macmillan Company (page 153) : "One of the interesting applications of the new synthetic ad hesives to an historical object concerns the Royal State Coach built nearly 200 years ago. The iron-shod wooden wheels be came uneven by as much as an inch, giving a very uncomfort able ride in the coach. The problem therefore was to true up the wheels and to provide a solid rubber tyre as a running surface. The original iron tyre could not be removed from the wheels, so a cotton bandage impregnated with resin was wound round the tyre and the whole assembly cured in posi tion by infrared lamps. Next, the wheel was rotated past a cutter which removed the high spots in the resin/cotton layer until the wheel was truly circular. The tyre for the wheel was then made by bonding a strip of rubber to a steel strip with synthetic resins. Finally the steel/rubber strip was bolted to the original iron tyre as an anchorage. In this way a truly circular and quiet-running wheel was made, so that the State Coach could be used with comfort during the Coronation." On chance and mathematicians and mathematical discovery, Dan Pedoe tells us on page 35 in The Gentle Art of Mathematics, copyright Dan Pedoe 1959; $3.50; The Macmillan Company, 60 Fifth Avenue, New York 11, N.Y., used with permission : "Questions relating to chance interest everybody. During the war a B.B.C. Brains Trust was asked : 'What is the law of averages?' Without the slightest hesitation, and without even a pro visional 'It all depends on what you mean by law or average,9 the late Dr. C. E. M. Joad answered: 'The law of averages says that if you spin a coin one hundred times, it will come down heads fifty times, and tails fifty times.' The oracle had spoken. There was no discussion. If the reader feels that this is a correct statement, he should spin a coin one hundred times. If he does get fifty heads and fifty tails exactly, the experiment is worth repeating. If he</page><page sequence="8">HEBE AND THERE 297 continues to get exactly fifty heads and fifty tails, the law will not be working in his case! In fact, the law of averages is not a law, but expresses the feeling that unusual events do not occur frequently." From page 137: "What kind of human beings become mathematicians? In some cases it is probably true that a man turns to mathematics as a compensation for an inability to face the external world. But there are mathematicians of all sorts?mathematicians who are genial giants, mathematicians who look like rotund Rotarians, mathematicians who are tone-deaf, mathematicians who adore Bach, mathematicians who play jazz, mathematicians who dance the samba, mathematicians who are obviously mathe maticians, and nothing else, and mathematicians you would never suspect of bdng mathematicians. The one faculty com mon to all mathematicians is the capacity for abstract thought." On page 139: "Let us see what Poincar? says about this in his 'Science and Method.' " 'What, in fact, is mathematical discovery? It does not consist in making new combinations with mathematical entities that are already known. That can be done by anyone, and the combinations that could be so formed would be infinite in number, and the greater part of them would be absolutely devoid of interest. Discovery consists precisely in not construct ing useless combinations, but in constructing those which are useful, which are an infinitely small minority. Discovery is dis cernment, selection. " 'Mathematical facts worthy of being studied are those which, by their analogy with other facts, are capable of leading us to the knowledge of a mathematical law, in the same way that experimental facts lead us to the knowledge of a physical law. They are those which reveal unsuspected relations between other facts, long since known, but wrongly believed to be un related to each other.' "No mathematician would wish to add anything to this state ment."</page></plain_text>
