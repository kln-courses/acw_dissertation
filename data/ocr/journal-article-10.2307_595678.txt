Cressey, Divisional Dean of Social Sciences, for his address of welcome on behalf of U.C.L.A. That the members particularly wish to express their gratitude to outgoing President of the Branch, Prof. Wolf Leslau, U. C. L.A., for his exemplary leadership, culminated so effectively by his Presidential Address, a model of scholarship, both interesting and amusing in presentation. That the members wish to record their special ap- preciation, again to Prof. Leslau, who, by carrying out single-handedly and so successfully the duties usually performed by an Arrangements Committee, has set a commendable, if bold, precedent in this age of committee proliferation. That Prof. Mantle Hood should be accorded a funda- mentally inexpressible vote of thanks for adding a new dimension to Oriental studies as well as to Oriental entertainment, and for proving again that there is noth- ing amateurish in being an amatelbr, nor dilettantish in finding delight in sounds that have moved most of man- kind in the expression of joy, the assuagement of grief, the incitation to fun, and the invitation to love. That the members especially wish to express their gratitude to the Near Eastern Center, the Department of Near Eastern Languages, and to Prof. Richard C. Rudolph, U. C. L.A., for graciously entertaining the members and guests at dinner Friday evening. That the members express sincere gratitude to Richard G. Irwin, U. C., Berkeley, for his devotion to the efficient execution of the duties of Secretary-Treasurer during the past year, and particularly to the preparations for this, the Eleventh Meeting. That the members also wish to thank Prof. Denzel Carr, U. C. Berkeley, for his selfless service to the Branch as Vice-President, as well as the members of the Esecutive Committee and all other persons directly or indirectly responsible, for the efforts which assured the success of the past year for the Branch and its annual meeting.
