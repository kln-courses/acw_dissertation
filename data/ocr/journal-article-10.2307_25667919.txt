<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL of SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY. Vol. XVI.] July, 1882. [No. 3. PHILOSOPHY IN EELATION TO ITS HISTORY.1 It has occurred to me that no topic could be more usefully or appropriately dwelt upon, at the opening of the present session of the Aristotelian Society, than the relations which obtain between the History of Philosophy and Philosophy itself, the light which they reciprocally throw upon each other, and the assistance which the study of each may derive from the study of its complementary member. The Society wisely determined to begin its labors with an outline of the History of Philosophy ; and this was carried in our former session down to the end of the Greek or classical period. I venture to say wisely, because the method imposed upon us by our circumstances being that of self-instruction, and therefore tentative, and not dogmatic, the very first outlines of the subject-matter of philosophy itself are best learnt from its his tory by seeing what sorts of questions have occupied thef attention of philosophers, or those reputed to be such, and not from any manual or general view of the problems of philosophy, or of the distinction of its various branches. We are now, in the present session, about to enter upon a simi 1 An address delivered before the Aristotelian Society of London, October 11,1880, by Shadworth H. Hodgson, Hon. LL. D. Edin., President. 1 S * XVI?15</page><page sequence="2">226 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. lar outline of the remaining part of the history of philosophy; and the occasion seems opportune for bringing forward into dis tinct consciousness what sort of assistance we may expect, what sort of information we may derive, what sort of questions, rela tively to philosophy itself, we may look to have raised, and how far these questions are to be answered, by a general conspectus of the course which philosophical speculation and philosophical inves tigation have followed down to our own times. Taking these points, then, as the text of the following remarks, we must, in the very first place, begin by asking ourselves what, in the most general and provisional manner, is our conception of philosophy; what is that subject-matter the history of which we are to trace; in short, of what is it the history ? I say, in the most general and provisional manner'we must answer this ques tion, because a more definite answer would trench upon contro verted ground, and would, in fact, involve some theory or other about the nature of philosophy, which is among those very ques tions which we are going to the history of philosophy to get light thrown upon. Now, I think we may best avoid dogmatic assumptions if we imitate the method of our great Eponymus, Aristotle, in setting out on an inquiry, at the very origin of it, by asking what we ourselves, and reasonable men in general, mean by the term in question. If we ask what we, and reasonable people in general, mean by the term philosophy, I apprehend we shall find it some thing of this kind. In any subject whatever, great or small, we come to the philosophy of that subject when we come to explain to ourselves the facts or the conceptions which lie at the root of the laws governing it, or at the root of the axioms, if any, upon which its laws depend; facts or conceptions, therefore, which con nect that subject with higher or larger subjects, at the same time that they are presupposed by the laws and by the axioms which are appropriate to the subject itself. The axioms and the laws of that subject are its science, the connection of its axioms and laws with a higher or larger field of thought is its philosophy, showing whence it comes and whither it tends. In order to have the philosophy of a subject, it is not enough to have an intelligent knowledge of the facts and laws and method of the subject itself; it is requisite also to have its rationale?that is, its connection with</page><page sequence="3">Philosophy in Relation to its History. 227 other subjects, and its place and title to its place in the order of nature. For instance, a man may be a thorough master of the art of brick-making, he may know what bricks are, what sort of clay is the best, and what are the best methods of making them; but lie does not possess the philosophy of brick-making until he connects brick-making with architecture. So in verse-making; a man may have a perfect knowledge of metres.and rhythms, of sounds long and short, rough and smooth; but he does not possess the philosophy of verse-making until he connects it with poetry, until he sees the place which verse-making holds in the greater art of conveying and enforcing imaginative pleasure by means of the articulate sounds of language. Again, in mathematic, a man may be an excellent mathematician if he possesses the axioms, the definitions, the methods, and the practice of calculation founded on them ; but he does not possess the philosophy of mathematic until he connects the axioms, defi nitions, and methods with certain most elementary and ineradica ble notions of the human mind, and with the more general method of logical thinking. Every subject, from the least to the greatest, both in practice and speculation, has its rationale?that is, its philosophy?or, in other words, its rational connection with a larger whole, a whole of greater comprehensiveness, of more elementary conceptions, of simpler, fewer, and, at the same time, more fundamental and more universal facts. Every special branch of knowledge thus leads up, by its philosophy, to a sphere of knowledge wider and more gen eral than itself; and since this is the case with every special branch of knowledge, while the branches together constitute our picture or conception of the universe at large, and this universe is neces sarily seen by us, who look at it mentally from within, as one single universe and not several (which indeed is expressed by the name universe), therefore it happens that philosophy par excellence is the highest and largest rationale we can frame to our minds of the facts which the universe contains, and of the connection be tween its parts; and also points forward to a higher and larger rationale still, which is ex hypoihexi beyond our reach, but which also ex hypothesi would, if we could reach it, contain the rationale of that rationale, and be the philosophy of our philosophy, what</page><page sequence="4">228 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. ever the height or largeness of comprehensiveness our philosophy may at any time have reached, or may yet reach in the future. I feel myself, gentlemen, to be here verging on controverted ground, and therefore I shall say no more on this point. I mean that the nature, scope, and powers of philosophy, of our human philosophy, are matters of great debate and contention, especially whether we are or are not justified in taking into account, in any way, the possible existence of a knowledge beyond our human philosophy; that is to say, whether our human philosophy has anything whatever to do with the possibility of an existence be yond its own reach; or, again, in other words, whether that infinity, which is apparently involved in the conception of ever-widening spheres of knowledge, is or is not an illusion to which it may be pernicious to attend. This is one of the questions which are to be answered, if at all, only by a thorough investigation of philosophy itself. For what ever may be the answer, it is clear that philosophy has no other branch of knowledge beyond or larger than itself. Its rationale can be given at any rate only by itself; or, in other words, philos ophy and the rationale of philosophy are one and the same thing in point of kind. I say no more, therefore, on this point. But I would suggest?and this brings me back to the more immediate subject of the present address?that this question should be kept present to the mind in studying the History of Philosophy as we are about to do in the present session. I mean that it will form a useful clew or light, in reading any philosophical author, to keep asking ourselves, from time to time, how his views bear on what I may perhaps call the question of the infinite or finite char acter of philosophical truth. In taking, then, the History of Philosophy as our subject, we are really taking the series of those writers who have made it their aim to discover what I have described as the Rationale of the Universe. This aim it is which constitutes them philosophers, and the series of their theories the history of philosophy ; tor it is the history of the progress made towards a satisfactory rationale of the universe, as mentally visible from a human centre. Now, two things in this progress seem to call for special remark. The first is, that there is a definite progress in it, and a definite direction; there is a main highway, and there- are side-ways</page><page sequence="5">Philosophy in Relation to its History. 229 branching out from it, consisting either of subsidiary and auxiliary inquiries, or it may be of false routes struck into and followed from time to time, which seemed or seem promising, but in reality do not lead to the satisfactory rationale which is the final aim. This, then, is another question which ought to be present to the mind in reading the history of philosophy: Is the work or the theory before us in the highway of philosophy, or is it a subsidi ary inquiry, or is it a false start ? The second thing to be noticed is the essential and inevitable anthropomorphism of all philosophical theories. It is not only in theology that anthropomorphism is found, but in all philosophical speculation also. Everything comes to man through the medium of his faculties, through modes of his sense-perceptions, through the mode in which he thinks, or his logical faculty, and also through the modes of his more inward sensibility, his sensibility to emo tions, as well as to the various kinds of pleasure and pain both of emotion and of sense, and, most important, perhaps, of all in its influence on philosophy, through his moral sensibility or percep tion of what is morally right and wrong. It is mainly by noting the consequences of this latter circum stance that we can trace a progress in a definite direction in the history and distinguish the character of the various theories in the series. The aim of a Rationale of the Universe was at first per ceived but dimly; I mean that what it involved was not clearly perceived at first. But the conception expanded, and disclosed differences from within, in proportion as thought was fixed upon it, and as former theories supplied a starting-point and pabulum for new speculations. We have at the beginning the physical theories of the Ionic school. Even these were anthropomorphic in the sense that cer tain constructions of the sense-faculties of man, I mean material substances, were taken as realities which were considered, at any rate tentatively and provisionally, as ultimate realities. The an thropomorphism of the theories was not the less real because it was naive and unsuspected by the theorists. It was a step in advance when moral conceptions, such as love and hate, were brought in to complete the materialism of the ear liest theories, notwithstanding that these conceptions were derived directly from the innate mythological and imaginative tendency</page><page sequence="6">230 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. of the mind, and, when combined with the materialistic theories,, robbed them of their strictly scientific character. The moral ele~ ment thus introduced gave the theories a more comprehensive and, therefore, a more philosophical scope, separated them from theo ries which were scientific only, and sent the streams of science and philosophy to flow thenceforth and forever in different but con nected channels. It was again a great advance when logical conceptions were brought in, as they were by the Eleatic school, the conceptions of the One and the Many, the Permanent and the Changeable, and real existence sought for only in the former. This was logical anthropomorphism. Moral considerations of a higher order were made the staple of philosophy by Socrates; and by Plato these were combined with speculative considerations, in his theories regarding Ideas, depend ing on the one supreme Idea, to ?/, which was also to aya&amp;ov. This may be called the issue, result, and transfiguration of the lower and cruder forms of love and hate. Moral Good, accord ing to Plato, had originally ordered and continued to rule the universe. Aristotle presents us with a further elaboration of these concep tions. His definite distinction of four kinds of causes?the mate rial, the efficient, the formal, and the final; the conceptions of substance and attributes; his great distinction between potential ity and actuality, as, respectively, the terminus a quo and the ter minus ad quern of every strictly natural process ; and the full sep arate treatment which he gave to so many branches of the world of thought?mark the culminating point of Greek philosophy. Systems there were, also, which made moral considerations the centre of speculative theories ; such were Stoicism and Epicurean ism. This was a transposition of the speculative centre of gravity, which marks, as it seems to me, a side-way of philosophy, leading to no final rationale of the universe. I do not wish to dogmatize on the point. I would merely suggest, on the occasion of men tioning these two great schools, the question which they seem to raise for students of the history of philosophy?the question whether a practical principle can be made the centre, pivot, or basis of a theory of the universe, which, as something far trans cending man's minute powers of affecting it, is to an enormoua</page><page sequence="7">Philosophy in Relation to its History. 231 extent removed from the practical application of that principle,, though remaining always the object of theoretical inquiry. In Neo-platonism we have an attempt to combine theology and morals with philosophical speculation in one comprehensive theory based upon Plato's to wya&amp;ov. What are we to think of a system of this kind ? I know not whether I am right, but two things occur to me which seem to militate against its sufficiency. In the first place, it was already ruined beforehand in its base, inasmuch as Plato's own theory had been already transcended by Aristotle's analysis. The theory that Ideas were efficient forces was no longer tenable ; the realistic doctrine, as it was afterwards called, namely, that universals were real things, real forces, was no longer tenable. It was one thing to say with Aristotle that the real thing was to be apprehended by way of definition?that is, by the intersection of two universals?and quite another thing to say with the Realists that a single universal could express a single reality. In the next place, Neo-platonism, supposing itself to be the true philosophy, aspired to make this philosophy into a religion, to exhibit it as the truth of mythology and of cult us, from what ever origin they might have sprung, whether Greek or Oriental. Now, it is one thing, having a religion to begin with, to formulate it in philosophical language, to clothe it with a philosophical creed; and it is quite another thing to formulate first a philo sophical system, and then to bring religion into it and make it serve as a creed. Religion will not be at home in a dwelling so fashioned. These things seem, in my eyes at least, to be flaws which mark Neo-platonism as a by-way, leading away from any final rationale. The first affects it in its character of a philosophy the second in its character of a religion. We are now at the point reached by the Society in its former session. And we stand also at the threshold of a renovation in philosophy from a totally different source. We have traced it in its Greek stream ; and we have traced it to its glorious result, the elaboration not merely of a theory, but of a system of theories, a philosophical system of many theories, some strictly and solely scientific, others strictly philosophic, but all connected into a great philosophical whole, the work of our own Eponymus, Aristotle. In Aristotle we find a system of various branches. First, there are his Physics, then his Astronomy, then his Natural History,</page><page sequence="8">232 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. then his Psychology; this series begins with matter and ends with mind; then we have another series which begins with mind and ends with the universe; first, the Organon, that is to say, the theory of Logical Thought, and the theory of its application to the discovery of the Laws of Nature; then we have the practical sci ences of Ethic and Politic, and the subsidiary science of literature in the Rhetoric and Poetic; and finally we have the crown of the edifice in the unfinished treatises of the Metaphysic, or First Philosophy, or, as Aristotle also named it, Theology. We have in Aristotle's system the very type and mould of all genuinely philosophical speculation. But was this system final, in the sense that it required only filling up of its outlines, and cor rection of details by fuller knowledge and further discoveries ? Did it so take in all human knowledge as to be secure from being overturned in its principles ? I put these questions not as being about to suggest an answer to them, but, on the contrary, to re mark that, in my opinion, the true answer is yet to be given by the course of philosophical history which is to us at the present fay future. We have not yet seen, mankind has yet to see, what the result upon the main principles of Aristotle's philosophical system, as a system not of science but of philosophy, what the final result will be, of the introduction into human life and thought of that moral and emotional principle, of that spiritual power, which is designated by the word Christianity. It may be that the Aristotelian outlines will expand to contain it; it may be that a new system of conceptions will .be demanded for the purpose. That principle of spiritual life which we call Christianity had its own battle to fight, with internal or at least intimately con nected foes; in struggling against which it was compelled to cast itself into the mould of a philosophical creed or theological phi losophy, in which form it was, when reached, that it imposed itself upon the nations composing modern Europe, after the breaking up of the Roman Empire. The struggle which resulted in its being constituted as a theological philosophy, the battle fought by the Christian principle of spiritual life, was fought against Gnosticism, and such heresies, as they were called, of the first few centuries, as were more or less of a Gnostic character. Gnosticism also was a theological philosophy, and had its home in the East, on the</page><page sequence="9">Philosophy in Relation to its- History. 233 border-land between the Greek and the Semitic intellect, a terri tory which was long debated between it and Christianity. The nature of this struggle you may read vividly depicted by one who was himself involved in it, in its later stage, by St. Au gustine (a. d. 354 to 430) in that part of his Confessions which relates his inner struggle with, and final conversion from, Mani chseanism. This little book, the Confessions of Augustine, ought to be familiar to every student of philosophy. Besides the deep personal interest of it, and besides its historical interest, the direct and searching philosophical analysis which it contains on many points, the theory of Memory and Association of Ideas, for in stance, renders it most instructive. By St. Augustine's time the battle had really been won. Chris tianity had in the course of it invested itself in the panoply of a theological philosophy, which in later times was destined possibly to be more of an encumbrance than a help, when the enemies of the spiritual life which is its essence were of a totally different order. But such as it was, it was a system which was capable of harmonizing with the Aristotelian system, or at least with a par ticular reading of that system, which by the fusion of the two became fixed and authorized as the true one. The system which arose from the union of the Aristotelian and Church philosophies is that system which is known as Scholasticism; the great philo sophical construction which employed the intellectual energies of the Middle Ages, and which still looks down upon us like a vast cathedral of thought, promising itself a duration even longer than the material cathedrals which are its coevals and its counterparts. Here I will pause for a moment to remark that the title by which the new spiritual life of Christianity comes into philosophy lies in its containing new facts in human nature. There were certain phenomena in human nature which were developed in the consciousness of the Hebrew nation, and were all but unknown to the Greeks, all but unknown to the Romans. These phenomena are generally summed up in the word Revelation. But it makes no difference, for the present purpose, whether we call them a revelation from God or not; they are at any rate facts in human nature and human character. And facts in human nature and character are as much facts upon which philosophy is to be built as are facts in the physical constitution of the material world.</page><page sequence="10">234 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. Man as well as nature, or, in other words, nature in all its branches?inorganic, organic, and consciously organic?is the sub ject-matter of philosophy, which aims at a rationale of the uni verse. It would be the play of Hamlet without the part of Ham let to omit them. That is not only why we have a theology in place of a philosophy in modern Europe, but also why we cannot contest the right of this theology to be really a philosophy. Phi losophy must make room within itself for a religious philosophy just as much as it must make room for a philosophy of morals, or for a philosophy of poetry and poetical imagination. I will mention one of the most cardinal of the facts which I have spoken of as developed in the consciousness of the Hebrew nation, and necessitating a renovation of philosophy. It is that sense of standing in immediate relation to an Infinite and Om niscient Power, a sense which made humility appear as the true attitude of man, the creature of a day, a finite and imperfect Being, in the hand of a Being infinite and perfect. Humility towards God became thus a distinguishing mark of Christianity, and, regarded as a virtue, was a virtue unknown to Greek ethic. And the change thus wrought extended not only to man's rela tions with the Divine; it modified also the whole aspect of his relations to his fellow-men. But it was not in the character of an ethical theory that this sense of the Divine Infinity necessitated the renovation of philosophy; it was in the character of afact in human nature which had to be accounted for and made room for in speculative theories. Human nature was a different thing, in respect of this fact, from what it had been conceived to be by Greek philosophers. The question was, What was the origin, what the permanence, what the bearing on other facts, of this pro found sense of a personal relation to the Divine Infinity ? This was one of the new ingredients which entered into Christian phi losophy, and finally combined with Aristotelianism in the great system of Scholasticism. The question concerning Scholasticism is not whether it is a philosophy ; for its aim and scope of being a rationale of the uni verse guarantees this, just as the same scope guarantees the same title to Hegelian ism, or to Agnosticism, or even to Comtian Posi tivism ; though with regard to this last it must be remembered that, since Comte expressly repudiates the attempt to deal with</page><page sequence="11">Philosophy in Relation to its History. 235 the universe, and substitutes the expression world, as the proper object of philosophy, we can only bring Comte's system under our present large definition of philosophy by adding a limitation and defining it, say, as a rationale of the universe so far as such a ra tionale is profitably to be sought for?a limitation whereby a prac tical consideration is made the pivot upon which that philosophi cal system turns. The question, I say, with regard to Scholasti cism is not whether it is a philosophy; the question is simply this ?and this ought to be present to our minds in considering its history?whether its rationale of the universe is a true and suffi cient one. Its claims are actually present claims. We are too apt to for get, in Protestant conn tries, that it survived the Renaissance ; sur vived it not only in Roman Catholic countries, where it is still taught officially, but in Protestant countries also, our own for in stance, where the ordinary notions current on philosophical topics being derived from Church teaching, are all of a Scholastic char acter, fragments, so to speak, of Scholasticism, though we have forgotten out of what rock it is that they are hewn. Every one at the present day who has, or rather thinks he has, no philosophy at all, and does not aim at having one, not being at the same time a pronounced sceptic, is really an adherent of Scholasticism. And hence also in some cases it is, that those who reject either Scholas ticism, or the previous theological philosophy on which it was partly based, are sometimes taxed by their adherents, not with philosophical error only, but also with the religious error of infi delity. The term infidelity is an easily discharged missile, but one that is rarely discharged by artillery of precision, for it is an ambiguous term, meaning both disloyalty to God and disbelief of a creed concerning him. It is a fact which throws much light on the present situation, that every religion, the moment that it clothes itself with a creed, clothes itself with a philosophy, and to that extent becomes amenable to philosophical criticism. Now, the line between a religion and its creed is a line not easy to draw. The history of philosophy entered on another phase at the time of the Renaissance, along with all other branches of knowledge and culture. Partly the general development of thought, partly the new acquaintance made with classical antiquity, partly the</page><page sequence="12">236 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. new progress made in scientific invention and discovery, gave a new impulse and direction to philosophical speculation also. Vari ous currents arose and crossed or blended with each other. The activity of thought was immense. The reaction against Aristotle which was so prominent a feature in the turmoil, in Giordano Bruno, for instance, and in Bacon, was at bottom far less a reac tion against Aristotle than against Scholasticism, with which his great name had been identified. Thus was opened the modern era in philosophy?an era of mental activity recalling, and indeed repeating, on a higher and more complex stage, with new ingredi ents in philosophical questions, ingredients more especially of a spiritual or religious character, the philosophical activity of Greece before Aristotle. In reading this part of philosophical history it will be well to keep the question constantly before the mind, In what precise ways these three, or other similar causes, operated to change or broaden the current of philosophical ideas, I mean Religion, Greek Literature, and Scientific Progress. What were the relations of the Reformation to philosophy? What those of general culture ? What those of science ? The effect of the last seems to have been, and still to continue in our own days, most marked and definite. Everywhere, in instance after instance, in explaining the proper ties of things, the scientific conception of relations took the place of the Scholastic conception of causes?causes which were inherent in the nature of substances and destined for the production of their specific effects. Gravity, for instance, was no longer regarded as a specific property, inherent by nature in heavy matter, causing it to fall; but the phenomena of rising and falling bodies were shown to be resolvable into the relative composition of volumes or masses of matter and the relative movements of their parts ac cording to certain laws. Everywhere the short and easy solution apparently offered by occult causes, inherent in the nature of par ticular classes of things, was shown to be delusive. And while in this way our apparent knowledge vanished and our real knowl edge grew, the prospect of an ultimate solution became ever more and more remote; the philosophical horizon receded, and the philosophical problem had to be restated. A rationale of the universe was still the problem before the philosophers of every school and every tendency. In this point</page><page sequence="13">Philosophy in Relation to its History. 237 the modern philosophy differed not from the Greek. But was there not some general and pervading difference between the two, common to all the modern schools, and differentiating them all alike from the ancient, besides the difference of the higher stage of scientific knowledge on which they stand, and besides the pos session of the new religious ingredients in the problem ? The general difference between ancient and modern philosophy is a question well worthy of being kept before the mind in reading its history. How does a modern differ from an ancient in his way of viewing philosophical questions; or is there no other differ ence besides those I have mentioned? It has been often sug gested, and I think correctly, that an increased predominance of subjectivity is the general mark distinctive of modern philosophy; by which is meant, that we moderns approach philosophical ques tions not so much by asking what the things are into which we inquire, as by asking what we know about them, and what they appear to us as being. Here, as it seems to me, is the distinctive and general mark of modern philosophy. Observe where and at what point, or rather at what period, in the history of philosophy the distinction assumes reality and manifests itself as operative. It was during the period of the Renaissance, it was when men's minds assumed the attitude of self-guided inquirers, tentatively learning to see and read the book of nature and of man, instead of the attitude of developing a dog matic system from principles supposed to be beyond the reach of doubt. It was, in other words, during the period when men turned away from the elaborate system of Scholasticism, based upon the Aristotelian conception of Substances, and asked them selves what in fact either they, or Aristotle himself, knew about substances; asked, in short, not what substances were, but what they were known to them as being. The importance of this change of attitude, as bearing on the history of philosophy, consisted in this, that it turned mdn's atten tion inwards, to the analysis of the mind's endowments and modes of operation. It turned men's attention to what is sometimes called psychology as distinguished from metaphysic. It sent them to look at the facts of consciousness as such ; instead of deducing endless strings of conclusions from the definitions of the various entities, or substances, their attributes, accidents, and relations. It 1 6</page><page sequence="14">238 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. sent them again to facts, and this time more especially to subjective facts. I do not myself adopt the terms psychology and metaphysic in the meanings I have just assigned to them. But that is matter of nomenclature. The facts indicated are, I think, indisputable; the study of the definitions of abstract entities, treated as realities, was neglected for the study of the facts of consciousness as they lay open to introspective analysis. The connection of this analysis with physiology was another step in the same direction. And this is a branch in which, as I need hardly remind you, the most significant discoveries are being made by modern research at the present time. Physiological psy chology is an indispensable auxiliary of philosophy proper. It is not by itself philosophy, for its purpose is not to find a rationale of the universe; but as controlling the speculations which are directed to that end, by showing what the material and organic conditions are upon which all feeling and thought depend, it fur nishes an aid to philosophy which is daily and yearly becoming more considerable and more definite. From Descartes downwards, through all the series of philoso phers of the seventeenth and the greater part of the eighteenth cen tury?in Gassendi, in Spinoza, in Hobbes, in Malebranche, in Leib nitz, in Locke, in Berkeley, in Hume, in Wolf, in Mendelssohn? the problem which chiefly occupied attention, and upon which the rest were made to hinge, was the large and complex one of the Relation between the Soul and the Body. It was a vast problem, including many subordinate ones, which presented various faces for examination, and gave rise to various theories, as, for instance, those of " physical influence," of "occasional causes," of " pre established harmony," of " innate ideas," of the " ideality of mat ter." I do not mean that this problem was taken as the whole of philosophy, but that it was that part of philosophy upon which men's minds were predominantly engaged. Not only the subjec tive, but more particularly the psychological, side of philosophy was therein uppermost. But the most decisive step in the direction of subjective analysis, and away from the method of deduction from definitions of enti ties, was taken at the end of the last century by Kant. The time was ripe, and the man appeared. I will not dwell upon what he did for philosophy, or how he did it. We shall no doubt have</page><page sequence="15">Philosophy in Relation to its History. 239 this well discussed when his turn arrives, in the course of the present session. I wTill content myself with remarking that, so closely do wTe still stand under the shadow of Kant's great theory of the nature and mode of knowledge, for us the study of phi losophy and the study of its history almost coincide in the stildy of Kant. Kant, we may say, brought entities to the surface, made the irreducible, insoluble, foreign matter in the body of knowledge show itself in its true colors ; but he did not himself expel it from the system. I allude, of course, to the Dinge-an-sich, lhings-in themselves, of which he gave us the subjective theory in his " Critic of Pure Reason." From that time to this, what we have had in philosophy is either attempts at systems or rationales of the uni verse constructed without Thing s-in-themselves, or attempts at bringing in Thing s-in-themselves again by systems of an openly or covertly Scholastic character. I do not know that it is needful to enumerate the principal philosophies which are urging their claims at the present day ; nevertheless, for the sake of precision and definiteness, it may be advisable to do so. First, there is Scholasticism, of which we have already spoken ; then there are the two German systems, Hegeli anism on one side, Schopenhauer's system, and Schopenhauer's system as modified by Von Hartmann, on the other ; then there is Comtian Positivism ; then there is what may be called Philosoph ical Phenomenism, of which M. Renouvier is the chief exponent; then there is Mr. Herbert Spencer's system, which, having " The Unknowable" for its basis, may fairly, I suppose, be called Agnos ticism. All these aim at some rationale of the universe, and therefore come within the description of Philosophies ; the ques tion, of course, being reserved, how far any of them is a true or sufficient rationale, or capable of being developed into one. Besides these there are numerous philosophical theories or sys tems, which it would be impossible to enumerate here, even if I could do it, associated with the names of distinguished writers, and founded some mainly upon Leibnitzian, some upon Spinozistic, others upon Kantian or upon post-Kantian ideas, and striking out lines and methods of inquiry more or less important and original. The post-Kantian epoch, to which we belong, has been, and has not yet ceased to be, fruitful in speculations, the issue of which is</page><page sequence="16">240 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. not at present visible; it is comparable, in complexity at least, to* the Renaissance period in philosophy. Finally, there ought to be mentioned, to make our sketch com plete, two tendencies rather than systems of philosophy, always at least latent in the world, and sometimes prominent; I mean, first, philosophical Scepticism, which denies the possibility of any ten able philosophical theory at all; and, secondly, philosophical Ma terialism, which regards solid resisting matter as the be-all and end-all of existence. Such is a brief, necessarily a very brief, sketch of the chief features in the philosophical world in which we live. Such is the last and now present stage of that course of the history of philoso phy which we either have traced in our former session, or have now to trace in the present one. I have made no mention of the philosophies or philosophers of other times or countries than those which are our*own immediate forerunners; have said nothing of the systems of China, or of ancient India, or of ancient Persia. Not that these are not of extreme interest in many ways, or that they do not throw great light on our own philosophical history ; but that I think it is of prime importance to realize this great fact, namely, that philosophy itself, at any stage, and therefore our own philosophy at the present day, is the outcome and the product of its own previous history, and that this history at every stage has been influenced and conditioned by the social and po litical circumstances surrounding the men who devoted themselves to philosophical study. Just as in any other branch of history, just as in social and political history at large, so also in the history of philosophy, the past is the parent of the present, and both together of the future. Students of philosophy, those who labor either at discovering some new fact which may be built into a rationale of the universe, or at removing some old error or dispelling some old obscurity, are in fact helping to make philosophical history as well as to make philosophy; are making philosophical history in the same sense as those are making political and social history who take part in political and social life with the view of promoting some distinct line of policy. Let no one think that he is not philosophizing un less he produces a system of philosophy.

The study of philosophical history is, therefore, chiefly impor tant for this, for the light it throws upon the state of philosophy itself at the present time; it shows us the significance and the drift of philosophical questions, just as the history of a nation is important as throwing light upon the significance and the drift of institutions, laws, and political measures. That is the main and immediate use of the History of Philosophy; that is the main service which it renders to the students of philosophy itself. And this it is, this point of view it is, which it is important before all things to keep in mind while studying the history. The his tory serves as a lantern to show us where we are going, and what we are doing, in philosophy. We may learn much, no doubt, from the writings of philoso phers, from their controversies, from the method in which they handle philosophical questions. But in so using them we are using them not as history but as philosophy, we are taking them not on their historical but on their philosophical side. The works of the great masters, Plato, for instance, or Aristotle, or Kant, are in this respect imperishable and indispensable sources of in struction. They form trie mind for philosophy, and are as fresh and living now as they were when they first saw light. The sys tems perish, the methods remain: " The form remains, the function never dies." But, I repeat, there is a wide difference between studying the works of those who have made a name and a place for them selves in the history of philosophy, as works of philosophy, and studying them as parts of the history. In the former case we are really studying, not the history of philosophy, but philosophy itself. Such is the true connection, gentlemen, in my opinion, between philosophy and its history. But before concluding I will briefly contrast this with two other ways of studying the history, which will bring out my meaning perhaps more clearly. In the first place, the history of philosophy being, as we have seen, a part or branch of the general history of mankind, we may study it in that 1 6 * XVI?16</page><page sequence="18">242 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. character. We may study it, I mean, not so much in connection with its subject-matter, philosophy, as in connection with other branches of general history, and in order to throw light on the general history rather than on philosophical problems. This would be treating it as a portion of general mental development, and in this way it is part of the general field to be trodden by the historian of mankind. It is then studied without any express reference to the truth or error, the sufficiency or insufficiency, of the rationales of the universe which are or have been proposed from time to time in the course of the history, but solely with regard to the fact that such and such theories have been pro posed. It is not needful to a student of this kind to have any interest in philosophy as such; to him a philosophical system may have the interest which a rare plant or animal, or a curious fossil in some geological formation, has to the mere amateur in zoology or geology. But though this way of studying the history of phi losophy is not only perfectly legitimate, but also has a great value and interest to the student of the general history of mankind, I question much whether a real and true understanding of any part of philosophical history is attainable in this way; I mean without the interest which springs from the subject of philosophy itself. Just in the same way I should be inclined to distrust the depth and accuracy of a history, say, of Literature or of Poetry, which was written by one who took no direct and immediate interest of his own in the beauty of a literary or poetical style. I should think him apt to be a Dryasdust. The second way of treating the history of philosophy which I will mention is the very opposite of this. It consists in treating philosophy as already attained, the true rationale of the universe as already known, and from that height contemplating the prog ress made by the history as a progress up to the attainment of the true philosophy, and looking forward to its future history as a further development of the same theory. This way of looking at the history of philosophy is, of course, only possible to those who think that they have attained, at least to some considerable ex tent, a grasp of the true and final and sufficient theory of the universe. Their philosophical theory, their rationale of the uni verse, then furnishes them with a clew to the history; they judge every event and every stage in it, attribute importance or unim</page><page sequence="19">Philosophy in Relation to its History. 243 portance, look on it with favor or disfavor, according as it leads np to or away from the establishment of that philosophical posi tion on which they have taken their stand. This way of looking at the history of philosophy must be more or less, in greater or less degree, adopted by every one who'be lieves himself, I do not say in possession of, but even on the high road to, a true theory of philosophy. In proportion as he is con vinced of his theory, and in proportion as that theory is a com plete one, will he be led by it into a dogmatic treatment of the history of philosophy. Any knowledge really attained becomes the stepping-stone to further knowledge?that is, becomes the basis from which you start, as an a priori foundation; that is, originates a method to some extent dogmatic. Extreme instances of this way of treating the history of phi losophy are those of Hegel and of the Scholastics. The latter make all history centre round the doctrines and discipline of the Church, and judge every theory and every event in history by its leading either up to or away from that central system. The for mer sees in all the history of philosophy, as in every other branch of history also, the development of the Logical Concept, Begriff, in its three stages, his theory being that the development of the Logical Concept is the true rationale of the universe. Similar to these in some degree, but by no means so strictly or minutely dogmatic, is Comte's reading of the history of philosophy by the light of his " Law of the Three States," which supposes that the final stage of thought?that of positivism without meta physic?has been reached and is possessed by the true leaders of thought, and will be finally taken possession of, with fuller knowl edge, by mankind at large, who are to follow in their steps. But this law is not originally due to a theorem in philosophy itself, like those of Hegel and the Scholastics; it was in the study of the history of philosophy that it came to light, and, what is more im portant, not in the study of the history of philosophy as such, but in the study of it as a branch of general human history. On the one hand, therefore, it does not prescribe so minutely as the other two theories the course which philosophy has taken or is to take in the future; but then, on the other hand, it is not like them a law founded on a theorem of philosophy itself. It thus stands midway between the two modes of dealing with the history of</page><page sequence="20">244 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. philosophy, which I have signalized, and draws some of its char acteristics from the one and some of them from the other.. I think, gentlemen, that neither of these two ways will recom mend itself to us for practical adoption in the present session. As to the dogmatic method, we are not yet, as a Society, in a position to accept any philosophical theory sufficiently complete to afford us the necessary vantage ground. And as to the other method, that of treating the history of philosophy as merely a part of the .general history of civilization, we are, I presume, bent, as a So ciety, to trace out and to use the history of philosophy with the aim, and for the end, of deriving from it light upon the great sub ject of our study, philosophy itself. No other ultimate aim than this is expressed by the name which the Society has adopted. Our purpose, I apprehend, is to make out, and by combining our efforts to help each other to make out, whether any Rationale of the Universe is attainable; to what degree, whether of compre hensiveness or of minuteness, such a rationale can be carried; and what system or set of principles has the best claim to be such a rationale in both respects; I mean, in respect both of the com prehensiveness of its range, and of the thoroughness and stability of its principles of explanation. Adopting, then, the position and aims of inquirers in this whole matter, and keeping this position and aim in view, let us proceed to the study of the efforts of former laborers in the same field, to gather from them what help we can towards the attainment of the one common aim, theirs and ours, a complete and true philosophy, so far as it is attainable by human powers.</page></plain_text>
