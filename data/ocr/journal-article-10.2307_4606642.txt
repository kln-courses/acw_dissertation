<plain_text><page sequence="1">ADVENTURES IN LIVING PLANTS, by Edwin B. Kurtz and Chris Allen, University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1965, 120 pp., $4.95. Adventures In Living Plants is an ap- proach to the study of botany in which the young reader (ages 10-12) is invited to swallow a special reducing pill for the purpose of having "adventures" in- side a plant. In this attempt to take the reader inside a cell, an ovary, a stomate, and inside the "plumbing system" of a plant, the authors distort concepts, ob- scure scientific meanings, and include misleading analogies. Chemical processes are described as mechanical processes. For example: "Enzymes (pictured as a handsaw) are the machinery of respiration. They cut food molecules into smaller pieces, and energy is released." "See those molecules of carbon dioxide and water going behind the molecules of chlorophyll ? Sugar and oxygen mole- cules will come out from behind the chlorophyll." Meanings are further distorted by the illustrations. In one instance, "the ad- venturers" witness molecules of gas being expelled from the stomate with at least the force of a volcanic explosion; and,</page><page sequence="2">Bios 23 in another instance, respiration is de- picted as a factory-type process by which energy is produced and packaged-com- plete with a face and label. Many experiments are included some of which are designed to promote a high level of skill development on the part of the reader. The experiments, however, do little, if anything, to clarify the mis- conceptions developed in the "adven- tures." Instead their main purpose ap- pears to be that of "doing" observation, measurement and graphing. In addition, the experiments often require equipment not likely to be readily accessible. The authors' suggestion that ashes and other materials be weighed on the scale at the grocery store may appeal to neither the experimenter nor the grocer. The style of writing and the attempts at levity do little to develop the literary quality of the text. For example, the pun: "What's an anther? Well, I'll tell you the anther!" Unfortunately, there is very little to recommend this book. The vocabulary load is heavy and in most instances is introduced without adequate development. Statements lack precision throughout the text, anthropomorphism is common, and incomplete sentence structure can be found. Alphoretta S.
