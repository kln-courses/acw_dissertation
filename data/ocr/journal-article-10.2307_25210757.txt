<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTICES OF BOOKS Le Vi?disme. By Louis de la Vallee Poussin. Paris, 1909. Professor Louis de la Vallee Poussin disclaims in the preface to this little book any originality as regards exegesis or " documents", but these matters are of no importance in a brief sketch of Vedic religion, and he brings to the work a profound knowledge of the general principles of religious interpretation, strengthened by application to the special problems of Buddhism which he has made so peculiarly his own. The result is that he realizes, as clearly as does Professor Hopkins,1 the complex nature of Vedic religion, and makes no effort to reduce it to a simple origin. In particular he recognizes (p. 120) that such questions as that of the priority of magic or religion cannot be settled by philology or the history of religion, but belong to the philosophy of history in the broadest sense of that term. Hence he combats on firm ground (pp. 60-8) any effort to deduce the Vedic pantheon, which he insists, as against Winternitz, is not a mythologj' in the making, but a system of which the origins are already far past, from either the "mythological" or the " evolutionary" basis. Aditi, as she is conceived in the Rgveda, is in no sense derived from a cow fetish,2 even if the goddess were at times conceived as present in such a fetish (zoomorphism); nor is the moral conception of vta derivable from the observance of physical order,3 nor the theology of Varuna a logical development of the simple myth of the sky by night. To tell the truth, these are 1 See especially India, Old and Xeio. 8 Cf.

This is not to say that Professor de la Vallee Poussin ignores the presence in the Vedic religion of lower elements. He calls due attention (pp. 57-9) to the fetishistic1 use of animal and material objects in the course of the sacrifice, but he rightly emphasizes the fact that these uses are not the most primitive, and that the sacrificer distinguishes between the god and the temporary presence of the divine spirit in the animal or the instruments. If, then, he denies idolatry (p. 56) to the Rgveda, it is not that he ignores the fetishistic use of a talisman of India,2 but that this again is different from the later paraphernalia of temples and idols, while, it may be noted, the Homeric poems likewise ignore idols, save in their latest parts.3 1 The terminology of writers on religion is very confusing. By fetishism I mean the respect paid to some object, or animal, or man, because the deity is?usually temporality, and always only in part?present therein, e.g. as in the wheel worship of the sun, see JRAS., 1908, p. 1098, or in baetyl worship, Conybeare, Trans. Third Inter. Congr. Hist. llel., ii, 177 seq. Theriomorphism (e.g. Indra as a bull) may be merely "mythological", but tends to fetishism. Zoolatry and chrematheism should perhaps be reserved to describe the worship of "natural forces", including animals, as directly and per se divine, a view older than "animism" in Tylor's sense (cf. Marett, Threshold of lleligion, Trans. Third Inter. Congr. Hist. Rel., i, 46; Clodd, ibid., i, 23), which develops into the anthropomorphism or theriomorphism seen in the llgveda, in which, however, moral con ceptions ore intricately blended. Totemism, which Poussin does not find in the ltgveda, implies at any rate, besides worship, a belief in a bond of blood with the divinity, and a social system based on that belief. It is very possibty a back path of religion, not primitive;cf.Toutain, ibid., ii, 121. A counterpart of zoolatry and chrematheism is demonolatry (cf. Farnell, Evolution of Religion, ch. iii), while abstract deities are present in the oldest religions we have. It may bo added that Hopkins {Religions of India, p. 135), who distinguishes chrematheism and pantheism and fetishism, regards some of the ritual veneration and, no doubt in part rightly, the non-ritual veneration of the drum, etc., as chrematheism. Gompcrz {Greek Thinkers, i, 522, 523) keeps the older use of fetishism as equivalent to chrematheism. 2 Hopkins, op. cit., p. 95. 3 Cf. Murray, Rise of the Greek Epic, pp. 148 seq.</page><page sequence="3">LE VEDISME 471 Again, though he believes in the existence of primitive high gods?a theory of Lang'sl?he does not find one in an Indo-European sky-god, for Dyaus is, he recognizes (p. 73), not represented in any such position by Indian sources. There are many other happy touches, like the recognition (p. 120) that with all its degradation the Atharvaveda is an aristocratic book, or the brief but complete summary of the nature of Rudra (pp. 99-101), where his Aryan and Hindu characteristics are forcibly presented.2 On a few points we would accept other views than Professor de la Vallee Poussin's. One or two of special interest may be mentioned. He accepts (p. 15) the view that it was an Indo-European rule to marry within the curia or phratria or caste (varna), but at the same time not within the circle of agnates or cognates. But this is a very bold hypothesis, and rests on little evidence. It has not the support of the Homeric poems nor of the Vedic Sanihitas. It is true that Senart3 in his interesting study of the origin of caste has attempted to prove that these rules of endogamy and exogamy are essentially Indo-European, but the evidence he adduces is quite insufficient to prove his point. As against the view based on Plutarch and an examination of the gentile names of women in Rome, it is sufficient to point out that ennptio gentis4 was usually forbidden, and that there is no evidence that connubixim among the patres included originally intermarriage between the different gentes, so that when the Plebeians obtained rights of marriage with the Patricians the transaction probably was aided by the 1 Making of Religion (1898); cf.

In Greece,1 again, there are only a few cases? based on special considerations?of close yevq; as a rule intermarriage was allowed. Of early India we can saj nothing positive ; our authorities2 tell us nothing, and later even the varna rule does not apply generally,3 while the gotra rule can be traced as growing in strictness4 in India itself. The most we can fairty say of Vedic India is that it disliked marriages of brother and sister5 and that this dislike extended itself. The same state of affairs can be seen in the Homeric poems.0 The fact may have helped the growth of caste, but, as against Senart, differences of race, geographical position, and occupation are equally important factors. Again, Professor de la Valine Poussin discusses (pp. 29-37) in a very interesting way the age of the Rgveda. He is inclined with Barth and Winternitz not to reject as wrong Jacobi's great chronological argument: we think this is to be much too favourable to it. It cannot survive Whitney, Thibaut, and Oldenbcrg's onslaught. On the other hand, he lays stress on the fact that the Buddhist lists do not seem to recognize colour distinctions of Aryan and non Aryan, which the Rgveda. does, and on the geographical change of scene. On the latter point we prefer the view of Pischel7 which finds the Vedic Indians settled on the Saras vat!, with the Indus no more an immediate presence, 1 Smith, Did. of Ant., i, 940; ii, 134; Cilbort, Greek Constitutional Antiquities, pp. 18(1 socj. 2 Cf.

Again, the argument from language is a dangerous one : we have no secure measure of the time taken for language to develop; the Latin of Cicero is only some three or four centuries later than that of the Duenos Inscription, and the close connection of Avestan and Sanskrit must be explained.2 Further, Professor de la Vallee Poussin seems (p. 87) to accept the finding of Iranian names in a thirteenth century Cuneiform tablet, where Aruna is suggested to be Varuna, but he lays no stress on this fact, and we have elsewhere questioned these attempts,3 on the general ground of the great uncertainty of the identifications. Professor de la Vallee Poussin promises a similar sketch of Brahmanism, the appearance of which will be awaited with interest.4 A.
