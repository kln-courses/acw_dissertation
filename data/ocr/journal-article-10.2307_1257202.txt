<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PROBLEM OF CHANGE IN THE ANCIENT WORLD' S. G. F. BRANDON MORE than a century has now passed since the scholars of Europe began their investigation of the sites of ancient culture in the Near East. Originating in the sporadic and unofficial ventures of consuls and travel- lers to obtain notable anticas, the process of research gradually became scientifically organised as learned societies, museums and universities, in Europe and America, stimulated by increasing success in the decipherment of various ancient languages, accepted responsibility for its conduct. The history of this investigation is significant as a record of the suc- cession of motives which inspired it. From the beginning the archaeo- logist has naturally been prompted by the hope of finding some superb " museum piece " such as the colossal winged-bulls which Layard brought back from Nimrud, or the beautiful limestone head of Queen Nefertiti which the German excavators of Tell-el-Amarna succeeded in smuggling out of Egypt, or the magnificent and costly funerary equipment with which the late Lord Carnarvon and Mr. Howard Carter amazed the world when they discovered the tomb of Tut-ankh-Amen in 1922. But experi- ence steadily taught that such spectacular " finds " had to be regarded rather as the chance rewards of a patient search after all forms of evidence of mankind's cultural past than as the main objects of that search. But before this lesson was learned another factor began to disturb what should have been the ideal equilibrium of a scientific quest. In 1872 a young assistant at the British Museum, George Smith, who was working there on the great collection of inscribed tablets which had been assembled from the early diggings in Mesopotamia, found a fragment of an Assyrian version of the Deluge Epic. The communication of his discovery to the Society of Biblical Archaeology on December 3rd of the same year caused so great a sensation that the Daily Telegraph actually financed Smith to go to Mosul in search of other fragments. And so the quest for written records which might confirm or illustrate the narratives of the Old Testament became for a time a dominant motive in the field-work of Near-Eastern archaeology.2 The influence of such sensational discoveries upon the interests of the earlier archaeologists can easily be understood and excused, even when today we lament the destruction of so much valuable, if unspectacular, 1 The thesis put forward in the latter part of this article has been elaborated, with a full discussion of the relevant material, by the author in a forthcoming book entitled Time and Mankind (Hutchinson). 2 cf.

Parrot, Archdologie mtsopotamienne (Paris, 1946), pp. 94 sq. 88</page><page sequence="2">The Problem of Change in the Ancient World 89 evidence which was caused by their frantic diggings into ancient sites hitherto undisturbed. Fortunately a more scientific spirit gradually asserted itself, especially in consequence of the devoted work of (Sir) Flinders Petrie in demonstrating the value of potsherds as chronological indices,3 and so today, as is well known, the greatest care is given during the process of excavation to cataloguing all data relative to even the most apparently insignificant objects which may be unearthed. The work of interpreting the rich abundance of archaeological material which the excavations in the Near East produced has similarly been conditioned by a priori interests. This has meant in particular that the task of understanding the Weltanschauungen of the various ancient cultures has severally been bedevilled by those who have believed that their views of the Bible must find confirmation from beneath the soil of Palestine, Egypt and Mesopotamia, or by the protagonists of some all- embracing theory of the superlative importance, as an interpretative principle of life, of sun-worship, or of the mystery of the annual cycle of Nature, or the perverse promptings of the sex-instinct. However, the scientific instincts of the professional students of these ancient cultures have prevailed and attention has accordingly been austerely limited, perhaps in reaction, to the analysis and classification of the ever increasing data available. The result has been that the stan- dard studies of Egyptian and Mesopotamian religion, which have appeared during the last few decades, have been essentially descriptive accounts of the relevant beliefs and practices; scarcely any attempt has been made to understand the basic ideas and emotions of which the various cults were the formalised expressions.4 But now a notable lifting of this self- denying ordinance has been effected by a distinguished archaeologist in America. Last year Dr. H. Frankfort, Research Professor of Oriental Archaeology in the University of Chicago, published two books under the 3 cf. W. F. Albright, From the Stone Age to Christianity (Baltimore, 1946), pp. 20 sq. 4 In the interests of exactitude this statement requires certain qualification. The masterly volumes of the late Professor J. H. Breasted (The Development of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt, London, 1912 ; The Dawn of Conscience, New York, 1935) contained an important measure of interpretation of Egyptian ethical thought. In the field of the comparative study of religion the symposium Myth and Ritual (ed. S. H. Hooke, Oxford, 1923) may also be cited as an exception, and so may the recent Schweich Lectures of C. J. Gadd (Ideas of Divine Rule in the Ancient East, London, 1948). However, the statement is justified when such standard works are considered as those of A. Erman, Die Religion der Aegypter (Berlin und Leipzig, 1934) and E. Dhorme, Les Religions de Babylonie et d'Assyrie -R. Dussaud, Les Religions des Hittites et des Hourrites, des Ph~niciens et des Syriens (Paris, 1945), and J, Vandier, La Religion Ogyptienne (Paris, 1949). G</page><page sequence="3">90 The Problem of Change in the Ancient World titles respectively of Kingship and the Gods5 and Ancient Egyptian Religion,6 in which he maintains that the time has now come to interpret some of the essential religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians. II The most interesting feature of Dr. Frankfort's interpretation is with- out doubt the thesis to which the latter of his two books just mentioned is devoted. This thesis is in brief that the Egyptian Weltanschauung was built upon the basic conviction that the universe is essentially static and that, therefore, only that which is permanent is significant. Dr. Frankfort claims to trace the ramifications of this basic belief in almost every reaction of the ancient Egyptian to the experience of life. Hence he writes in general definition :' " While the natural phenomena are distinct and irreducible, several among them may be significant for one and the same problem; for instance, the problem of life and death is correlated with the sun's daily rising, but also with the circumpolar stars which never set, and, yet again, with the annual sprouting of the grain. Conversely, one single natural phenomenon may be significant for several distinct problems: for example, the sun's life-giving power makes him appear as the creator, the source of all existence; but his daily rising indicates a victory over the darkness of death, and his unalterable course through the sky exemplifies justice." The consequences of the belief are especially important so far as they concern ethics and the estimate of the individual's final destiny. The concept of Maat, usually identified with Truth and dramatically repre- sented in the typical Osirian Judgement Scene as the feather against which the heart of the deceased is balanced,8 is regarded by Dr. Frankfort as a concept belonging to cosmology rather than to ethics, in that it connotes the basic order of the universe which was divinely established at the creation. The concept, however, had important moral implications, for it logically followed that only in so far as it was lived in conformity with Maat, could a man's life, in the fullest possible sense of the term, be " good ". Hence for the Egyptian success meant attunement to the basic order of the universe, and in this light Dr. Frankfort is well able to 6 Chicago, 1948. 1 New York (Columbia University Press, 1948). See also The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man (Chicago, 1946), to which Dr. Frankfort contributed. 7 Ancient Egyptian Religion, p. 16. 8 One of the best examples of the scene is to be found in the Papyrus of A ni in the British Museum; cf. E. A. Wallis Budge, The Papyrus of Ani in the British Museum, a v1ols., (London, 1895).</page><page sequence="4">The Problem of Change in the Ancient World 91 explain the apparent moral complacency of such a series of moral pre- cepts as those of Ptahhotep : " From this point of view a man's success in life appears as proof of his frictionless integration with that order. The successful man possesses a remarkable quality and disposes of an impersonal force because of his harmonious attunement to society and nature. Hence those who are less fortunate should attempt to profit and improve their situation by a closer association with such a man."9 And it necessarily followed from this view that the Egyptian could have no sense of sin, as the Hebrew, but rather, as Socrates later taught, he looked upon moral evil as the outcome of ignorance of the true nature of things. The evaluation of individual destiny in terms of the belief that the basic order of the universe was static inspired, according to Dr. Frankfort, the manifold endeavour by magical means at assimilation with various entities which were regarded as eternal by the Egyptians. Hence the elaborate rituals whereby the deceased was identified with Osiris; for Dr. Frankfort sees in this deity a cosmic concept modelled on the per- manence which the Egyptians perceived in certain natural phenomena, e.g., the annual sprouting of the grain and the annual rising of the Nile. But behind this Osirian cultus there lay, he also maintains, a more funda- mental and primitive belief, namely, that the transfigured souls of the dead, the Akhu, could take their place with the imperishable stars which circle the pole. Accordingly, Dr. Frankfort concludesxo that, " whether the dead man's aim is the solar circuit, or that of the circumpolar stars, or the life of Osiris, the essential wish is the same : to be absorbed in the great rhythm of the universe ". However, after thus expressing himself, Dr. Frankfort hastens to anticipate an obvious criticism in freely admitting that in the extant texts there is " no plain statement that man will find blessedness as an immortal participant in the rhythm of natural life. For such a formula possesses a degree of abstraction which is totally unknown to Egyptian thought." Nevertheless, he maintains, the view which he has put forward may be fairly deduced as " the common denominator of the various imaginative conceptions which alone possessed significance for the Egyptians ". And he goes on to find further support in what he claims to be a significant lack of descriptions of the nature of the after- life in the Egyptian documents, for, if the dead were believed to be living in the great cosmic circuit of the sun and the stars, their state could * op. cit., p. 70. 10 op. cit., p. io6.</page><page sequence="5">92 The Problem of Change in the Ancient World not well be describedn---it is unfortunate in this connection that Dr. Frankfort makes no reference to the graphic scenes of celestial bliss which are depicted in several of the vignettes of the Papyrus of Ani in the British Museum. III The interpretation of the Egyptian Weltanschauung which Dr. Frank- fort has thus advanced is of great importance, if it be well founded, because it implies an extraordinary attitude towards the phenomena of temporal change. It would mean, in short, that in one of the earliest of human cultures, and one moreover which influenced and was influenced by the neighbouring cultures of Mesopotamia, Syria and Crete, there was developed a view of life which contradicted that which normally ex- presses the innate teleology of the human mind, namely, that though all is flux, man can exercise some measure of control towards the attainment of ends which he may choose. Moreover, this interpretation of the Egyptians' attitude towards life is significantly without parallel in the Ancient World. We may indeed grant that an early people, as they struggled from savagery to the beginnings of civilised living, might be very conscious of the fundamental necessity of law and order and in consequence might assert that there was an eternal pattern of law and order, divinely decreed, to which the whole of nature conformed. And such a supposition is in fact endorsed by the importance of the motif of the slaying of the Dragon of Chaos in the Mesopotamian Creation myth and by the idea of a primaeval over- throw of the Giants by the Gods in Hellenic mythology.12 Furthermore, there is abundant evidence from the astrological beliefs of the Meso- potamian peoples that among them there prevailed the conception of a predestinated scheme of events, while the belief that the temporal pro- cess was a series of recurrent cycles was a basic principle of Stoic cosmo- logy.13 However, the holding of such ideas did not contradict the in- stinctive teleological moulds of human thinking, for, even where some form of transcendent predestination was accepted, sufficient scope was given for human action to be significant-omens could be taken, magic 11 op. cit., pp. IO8-9. 12 cf.

Mancini, L'Etica stoica da Zenone a Crisippo (Padua, 1940), pp. 119-30. The idea of the time process as one of recurrent cycles was held widely by others than the professed adherents of Stoicism, cf.

Seen in this context, the Egyptian Weltanschauung, as propounded by Dr. Frankfort, would therefore not only have been unique in ancient thought, but also expressive of an evaluation of life which would make the Egyptian achievement in civilisation a truly inexplicable problem. Such general considerations, accordingly, render the soundness of Dr. Frankfort's conclusions suspect. But the importance of those con- clusions, should they be justified, prompts a closer investigation of the religion of Ancient Egypt, especially since, as the present writer believes, in Egyptian faith and practice there appears to be revealed in its clearest form a fundamental pattern of human reaction to the experience of temporal change. IV It is significant that in his book Ancient Egyptian Religion Dr. Frank- fort speaks almost exclusively of Osiris as a hypostatisation of certain natural phenomena, e.g., the annual revivification of Nature, the fructi- fying waters of the Nile's annual flood. In so doing he neglects an aspect of this great Egyptian god which is of profound import for any evaluation not only of Egyptian religion, but also of ancient thought generally throughout the Near East. This aspect of Osiris is expressed in the essential anthropomorphism of both his iconography and his myth, and it is of extreme antiquity. For example, on an ebony tablet of Semti, a Pharaoh of the First Dynasty, Osiris appears as a mummy invested with the insignia of the pharaonic monarchy, the form in which he is ever thereafter represented.14 Simi- larly in the earliest literary records of Egypt, namely, the so-called Pyramid Texts (circa 2400 B.c.) and the Shabako Stone (circa 3000 B.c.)15 Osiris is depicted as a man, howbeit divine, who is slain by his evilly- disposed brother, Set, and later restored in some way to life by Isis and her sister, Nephtys. The anthropomorphic drama, which is thus so early found as an established doctrine of Egyptian theology, is abundantly attested as a matter of profound concern to all ranks of society throughout the following three millenia, and latterly not in Egypt only but through- 14 See Guide to Egyptian Collections in the British Museum, (19o09 ed.), p. 19o. 16 The actual monument, which is now in the British Museum, was made at the orders of the pharaoh Shabako (716-701 B.c.), but it is generally regarded by Egyptologists as preserving a document of the First Dynasty; cf. G. Roeder, Urkunden zur Religion des alien Aegypten (Jena, 1915), pp. 164-8 ; J. H. Breasted, The Dawn of Conscience, pp. 30-1.</page><page sequence="7">94 The Problem of Change in the Ancient World out the world of Graeco-Roman culture'6-indeed our most complete account of the myth is contained in a tractate (De Iside et Osiride) written in Greek by Plutarch of Chaeronea (A.D. 46-125). Now the origin of this anthropomorphic conception of Osiris is obscure, and the fact has naturally stimulated much speculation. Among the various theories advanced it is notable that that which suggests that behind the god Osiris lay the memory of an ancient king has the support of at least three distinguished Egyptologists, namely, Professor K. Seth,"~ Professor A. Moret,18 and the late Sir E. A. Wallis Budge.19 Clearly, at this space of time and dependent upon the chance survival of the relevant evidence, it is impossible for us to prove definitely either way the case for the existence of some historical prototype of Osiris; we can only note the strong probability in favour of there having been such a prototype. More important for our purpose here, however, is the indisputable fact that from the beginning the Egyptians certainly be- lieved that Osiris had once lived in their land and undergone such crucial experiences. And the raison d'6tre of the preservation of this belief is equally sure and definitive. It is that the Egyptians believed that the immortality once gained by Osiris could be acquired by others through magical means. These means are well known, being variously set forth and alluded to in innumerable inscriptions and funerary papyri. The devotee was ritually assimilated to Osiris, so that, by being identified with him in his sufferings and death, he would be one with him in his resurrection from death.20 Now the important point for us to note here is that by this ritual identification the Egyptians in effect believed that an event which had taken place once in the remote past, i.e. the Death and Resurrection of Osiris, could either be magically re-enacted or its original benefits could be evoked from the past to avail in the present. It is impossible, of course, for us now to analyse the logic of ancient Egyptian thought in this matter, so that we cannot tell whether the original efficacy of Osiris' experience was conceived of as perpetually existent and ready to be utilised on the correct performance of the necessary rites, or whether it was believed that 16 cf.

However that may be as to the mode of the operation, the essential fact is clear, namely, that the Egyptians attempted to avert or reverse the change implicit in the death of an individual person by the magical evocation of what was believed to be an ancient event of superlative significance. Hence also in this crucial Osirian cultus the Egyptians gave proof of their conviction that temporal change is irrevocably significant, unless its decree were negated by the exact performance of a specific ritual of supreme magical potency. V Contrary then to Dr. Frankfort's view, we find the ancient Egyptians acting in response to the challenge of Time implicit in death in a way wholly consistent both with the fundamental teleological pattern of human thought and with the undoubted concreteness of conceptual thinking current at this early stage in the development of culture. And the evidence which we have deduced here from the cult of Osiris is sup- ported by the witness of other Egyptian practices. For example, it has reasonably been suggested that the curious and repulsive custom of embalming the bodies of the dead originated from the shock of finding Predynastic corpses, which had accidentally been preserved by the dry desert sand, subsequently uncovered and mutilated by beasts of prey; such discoveries thus surely affording a terrifying revelation of the ravages of Time.21 Then there is another aspect of the Egyptians' reaction to the spectacle of temporal decay which must be briefly noted. The late Professor J. H. Breasted has described in an eloquent passage"22 the profound impression made upon the Egyptians of the Middle Empire (circa B.c. 2000) by the sixty-mile rampart of ancient pyramids and ruined funerary temples which extended along the fringe of the Western Desert-an impression which indeed finds sombre voice in a hymn reputed to have been inscribed on the tomb of Antef, a pharaoh of the Eleventh Dynasty: 21 cf. G. E. Smith-W. R. Dawson, Egyptian Mummies (London, 1924), pp. 5-6, 23-4 ; A. Gardiner, The Attitude of the Egyptians to Death and the Dead (Frazer Lecture, 1935), P. 8. 22 The Development of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt, pp. 179-81 ; cf. The Dawn of Conscience, pp. 161-2. See also the comments of O. Spengler, The Decline of the West (New York, 1926), vol. I, pp. 12-13; A. J. Toynbee, A Study of History (Oxford, 1939), vol. IV, pp. 410-12.</page><page sequence="9">96 The Problem of Change in the Ancient World Bodies pass away and others remain since the time of them that were before, The gods that were aforetime rest in their pyramids, and likewise the noble and the glorified, buried in their pyramids. They that build houses, their habitations are no more, What has been done with them? 23 Accordingly, from an examination of the extant data of ancient Egyptian culture there appears to be evidence of a twofold attitude towards the phenomena of temporal change. The one we may thus describe as pessimistic: the spectacle of the decay of human life and institutions filled the Egyptians with a sense of hopelessness about the possibility of there being any abiding worth in this world-this view did not, however, lead generally to a morbid melancholy but rather to a philosophy of carpe diem, to a fierce grasping at the fleeting joys of this present life, as so many Egyptian pictures vividly attest.24 The other attitude we have already described, namely, that implicit in the belief that immortality could be attained by magical identification with Osiris. The importance of the elucidation of the Egyptian Weltanschauung in this respect is very great, for therein is presented in its clearest form the general pattern of ancient thought about the significance of life; the notable exception thereto being, of course, Hebrew thought in its post- Exilic formulation. The pessimism of Egypt can be strikingly paralleled in the Mesopotamian and Greek records, and also indeed in several of the Hebrew documents.26 The belief that Time's inexorable decree of death on all living could be either held off or circumvented by acquiring the virtue of some ancient hero's revivification by the magical simulation thereof finds expression in the various mystery-cults current in Levant; and indeed the belief has been handed down to the modern world in the Christian rites of Baptism and the Eucharist, for in the celebration of these rites it is believed that the faithful by ritual lustration are united with Christ in his Death and Resurrection,26 while the saving efficacy of his death on Calvary about A.D. 29 is continuously made available by its 23 Translated by A.

In that reaction will be found a significant anticipation of the attitude of hopelessness which is held to characterise much of the prevailing outlook on life; but the recognition of it will also indicate in turn that such an attitude is not necessarily fatal to the survival of the culture concerned. Then too, by way of contrast, the unique significance of the dynamic Hebrew interpretation of Time will be realised and also the effect of its peculiar legacy to Christianity in the building up of the Weltanschauung of Christian Europe- that traditional evaluation of which the apparent obsolescence now constitutes the major intellectual crisis of Western society. 27 I Corinthians, xi, 26-30, cf., E.
