<plain_text><page sequence="1">Volume XXXII, number 1 ASIAN MUSIC Fall/Winter 2000/2001 The Dhak, Devi Amba's Hourglass Drum in Tribal Southern Rajasthan, India' by David Roche As it is when a drum is beaten, the source of the emanating sound cannot be determined until the drum or drummer is revealed. -- Brhadaranyaka Upanisad, 11.4.8. [ca. 800 B.C.E.] In Mina villages of Udaipur District in southern Rajasthan, the word dhak refers to both an hourglass drum and to a spirit-possession ritual involving the drum. The singular naming is indicative of the cultural significance of both the drum and the ritual. In the Amba Devi Dhak ritual, maintained in select Mina villages, a designated medium (bhopa) is possessed by the spirit of a goddess, Amba Devi, during the course of a night of drumming and the sung recitation of Her miracles. It is notable that the Mina alone perform the Dhak ritual. The Mina and other tribal groups (adivasi, or "first people") of the four corners border region of the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra, are part of what I term the "Bhil culture zone" because they once shared a common language, Bhili. These adivasi communities continue to share common cultural performance practices. The Mina or Bhil represent a majority population in many tehsils or subdistricts of southern Rajasthan, and yet their cultural contributions have not been recognized by outsiders. These groups are typically marginalized from mainstream Hindu ritual praxis although they retain archaic traditions that may have had a much wider provenance than is commonly accepted as part of the general history of the region. It is my intention to examine this rich deshi or regional cultural expression in order to establish the authority of its voice. This paper focuses on the drum itself, taking a phenomenological approach to its organology, including a discussion of its construction, playing technique, origin myth, local history, and the broader context in which it exists. The drum accompanies ritual performance throughout the Bhil culture zone, including contiguously joined districts of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Maharashtra and among not only adivasi communities but also among other non-elite service or agricultural castes. Finally, the widespread existence of this drum can be interpreted through a model based on the idea of reciprocal acculturation espoused by D.D. Kosambi. My interpretation of Kosambi's "culture performance" model (after Singer) is built not on positing an essentialized hierarchy of "Great" and "Little" Traditions, but on the process by which South Asian culture is transformed and survives in palimpsestic fashion as an oral, or, in the case of the dhak drum itself, a material iconic record.</page><page sequence="2">60 Asian Music: Fall/Winter 2000/2001 The Drum as Emblem The ethnographic source data for this article was collected during dissertation field study that took place between 1981-83, principally among Mina adivasi villages in southern Rajasthan, India.2 At the same time, pulling the focus back from the Mina village that was the central site for this study to the next level of context necessarily references previous ethnographic and archaeological studies suggesting a wider provenance for the dhak drum and its ritual role among other related adivasi communities in western India. Again, at the next outwardly concentric level, the argument can be made that the range, complexity and continuity of cultural performance involving an hourglass drum in southern Rajasthan and contiguous areas of western India can be viewed as part of an even larger cultural continuum, a continuum of "reciprocal" or "mutual" acculturation.3 From scanning the relevant ethnographic and Sanskrit musicological literature, in particular the literature concerned with adivasi and caste- musician traditions in western and middle India and texts such as the 13th- century Sangit Ratnakara that catalogue the existence of a ceremonial hourglass pressure drum (the hudukka) in this region, the sense that organology in South Asia offers a real opportunity to travel along some surprising routes of acculturation is startlingly clear.4 Roderic Knight (1985) drew attention to this phenomenon in his study of the South Asian harp and its survival among only a handful of Pardhan musicians, self- identified to Knight as "cousins" of their patrons, Gond adivasis in eastern Madhya Pradesh. The present article travels some of these same routes for the dhak hourglass drum in its various loci of survival and comes to some explicit conclusions about the possible process of transmission of the dhak through and across cultural and community borders. This process, in itself, may reveal a startling and previously unremarked unity of culture expression in what I term the "Bhil culture zone." Theodore Grame (1973), in a thoughtful article on the symbolism of musical instruments, makes an important distinction between a functional, technological approach to musical instruments as, "tool[s] made to produce musical sound," and the more mythically connected approach by which societies shape instruments, "after [their] own symbolic preoccupations." Grame cites several instances as examples of the latter approach. Many societies preserve myths with motifs of an instrument's magical origin: a divinity descends, deus ex machina, and presents an instrument, machina ex deus, to a typically startled human, the first player, who then proceeds to play it flawlessly, winning the right to establish a line of hereditary musicians who continue to own and/or play it, to the exclusion of others. As Grame noted, "the instrument itself possesses the magical property." This is certainly the case in the story of the dhak among the Mina.5</page><page sequence="3">Roche: Hourglass Drum in Rajasthan 61 In the idiosyncratic working definition used here, an emblematic musical instrument is a material realization of divinity, geometric (i.e., aniconic) or anthropomorphic in shape, which, in Gilbert Rouget's (1985:126) apt description of the shaman's drum, functions as a "locus of all the symbols." It is an iconic musical instrument, an attribute of divinity and therefore, an emblem of cultural authority. In the various sacred musics of popular Hinduism, iconic instruments are believed to embody sakti (power). For the Mina of southern Rajasthan, the dhak signifies divinity as clearly as does the ritual iron trident on the altar or the peacock feather bundle wielded by the bhopa. It is an important component of the basic ritual theatrical properties. The dhak of the jagaran (all-night ritual event) is the sounding icon, the venerated icon, and its ritual role as the drum for accompanying the chanted narrative of Devi Amba's miracles signals an anticipated arrival of the divinities in the act of spirit-possession.6 The dhak, as an icon of immense phenomenological significance, triggers a personal, psychological response, an individual's rekindling of the Mina collective cultural consciousness. Viewing the dhak for the first time as the jagaran commences initiates a process of receptivity and anticipation for the action of ritual performance. The jagaran takes place inside the devra (gods' room), a rectangular roofed Mina temple, distinct from the open-air altars that are typical of southern Rajasthan, in which a flagstone platform supports ancestor stones and other ritual markers. In the devra, two dhaks are used. They rest on a shelf beneath the altar, under the wall of hingans (fired clay tablets with images of the deities in relief). The ritual event begins when the dhaks are carefully lifted off the shelf and taken outside where their heads are tuned by warming them over the hot coals in the devra courtyard fire pit. For the Mina, the chanting of the Devi Amba narrative is addressed to specific powerful beings. The intent is to call them down, to home them in on thejagaran event and the bhopa's body by "ritual radar." The dhak is the instrument of ritual control in this communication system, an instrument of and for the divinities. Moreover, the dhak is iakti, in the sense of projecting an immanent magical aura for Devi Amba, the goddess as dynamic power personified, as Sakti herself. The dhak is an icon that organizes and conditions ritual experience on both cultural and physiological levels. As Oliver Sachs (1985:141) notes in his explanation of the icon, the mind organizes naturally, almost holographically, through icons: Experience is not possible until it is organised iconically; action is not possible unless it is organised iconically. 'The brain's record' of everything -- everything alive -- must be iconic. This is the final form of the brain's record, even</page><page sequence="4">62 Asian Music: Fall/Winter 2000/2001 though the preliminary form may be computational or programmatic. The final form of cerebral representation must be, or allow, 'art' -- the artful scenery and melody of experience and action. In other words, Sachs' sense of the iconic process as a neurobiological act by which an individual gains "experience" parallels the dramatic process of unveiling and deploying the dhak at the jagaran. The ritual instrument is the icon and experiencing it visually signals a crossing of a threshold into numinous territory. The inseparability of drum, drum sounds, chant and divinity is further signified in the name assigned to the chant performance of the Devi Amba narrative and all its ancillary ritual activities. In Bhilvari dialect, it is amba devi ro dhak (Devi Amba's dhak). While naming a ritual complex by making the nomenclature indicating "ritual" or "ceremony" synonymous with the name of a drum is a common worldwide phemonenon, here it is unique: there is no other rural religious ceremony performed by any community in southern Rajasthan that represents both the name for the event and the name of a specific drum. The iconicity of the dhak is thus further reinforced by a semantic system coding an unambiguous message. When there is dhak drumming at a jagaran, the deepest Mina narrative of all, the recitation of the miracles of Devi Amba, is being performed.7 Construction and Playing Technique of the Dhak Most of the dhak drums found in circulation throughout the entire Bhil culture zone' in western India are constructed of black teak (Tectona grandis). They average 15 inches in length and 13 inches in diameter across the goatskin heads (see Figure 1). Newly constructed drums, such as those purchased from Dabgar-caste drummakers in the village of Ahar, adjacent to the city of Udaipur, may be constructed of a softer wood known locally as dudhi or khanni. Jyotindra Jain (1973:22), in describing the dhak of the Mina community of Pratapgarh tehsil [subdistrict], Udaipur district, Rajasthan, claims that the construction of the drum is bound to certain ritual restrictions. In particular, a magic time is associated with the drumskins and ligatures: the leather can only be worked in darkness (ideally the middle of the night or early morning) if it is to maintain potency as the favored signaling device between the natural and spirit worlds.9</page><page sequence="5">Roche: Hourglass Drum in Rajasthan 63 Figure 1: Dhak from Rajasthan. Photo: Rupayan Sansthan, courtesy Komal Kothari. The dhak, as found in the mountain villages southwest of Udaipur, is generally slightly smaller than the Gujarat and MAdhya Pradesh models, averaging 11 to 13 inches in length with a drumhead diameter of 6 to 8 inches. The heads (khal or samra) are made of goat hides which are attached to oversized circular bamboo rims (mali) by rolling them under while wet and allowing them to dry. Cotton twine (rassi) is threaded from one rim to the other in a zig-zag fashion around the drum. The twine is then pulled tightly and wound several times around the waist of the drum, over the zig-zag configuration, before it is secured with a knot, leaving a loose end of about a yard in length. This loose end is then tied to the twine central belt, forming a large loop which is placed over the drummer's bent and raised left knee as he sits (see figures). Generally, one or two large brass pellet bells are permanently attached to the central belt around the waist of the drum. (Dournon, membranophone classification #212.15, hourglass drum, hooped, cross-laced, variable tension caused by squeezing the lacing). The adivasi playing technique for the dhak in the Bhil culture zone is unique and differs from the technique of any other musicians playing hourglass drums in South Asia. In southern Rajasthan, among the Mina, two bhopa drummers performing for the ritual sit on a cotton rug, facing out</page><page sequence="6">64 Asian Music: Fall/Winter 2000/2001 from the northeast corner of the devra, the west wall with the main altar on their right, and the single, eastern door on their left. They sit with their left knees raised and their right legs either stretched out to the side or curled in front of the drum. The drum rests on the left foot. The twine loop is slipped over the raised left knee and the big toe of the left foot is hooked into the central twine belt. The drummer controls the variable pitch of the drum by pressing his foot toward the floor (tightening the lacing and raising the pitch) and lifting his foot again to lower the pitch. ...... ;= :.;;. % ,,, Figure 2: Bhopa Kaoa Pargi Mina playing the thali in closed (damped) position; village Undri tehsil Girva, Udaipur district, Rajasthan (1982). In their right hands, the drummers hold lightweight, curved wooden sticks about 18 inches in length, known in Bhilvari as vazam khebalo.? The left hand is used for damping the left drumhead. The Mina playing technique demands precise intonation, precision being an important factor in its signaling power. In southern Rajasthan, a single brass thali (rimmed plate) is turned face down on the floor and beaten by a third musician with a stick in the right hand (see Figure 2). A metronomic timekeeper, the thali player generally maintains a steady pulsation of alternating damped and undamped beats, in contrast to the more complex drumming performance. The strike tone is damped with the left hand touching the thali on the accented beat while the right hand maintains steady eighth-note strokes. The thali performance pattern balances the drumming pattern by emphasizing strong, ringing offbeats (see Example).</page><page sequence="7">Roche: Hourglass Drum in Rajasthan 65 - 118 thali 707 Shak ' w w thali D'O &amp;"" D 7 1 7 7 dhak 01 thali o 0 Example: Typical Mina dhak meter in a 32-count cycle. The first count of each measure is accented. The voice enters at measure three, finishing each phrase as the cycle repeats, then beginning again at measure three. The structure may be conceived as follows: a phrase of 14 counts followed by a three-count cadence and four-count rest, the three-count cadence and four-count rest repeated, followed by four single strokes on the dhak to end the cycle. Punaji Pargi, Mina Bhopa Drummer The Mina bhopas who play the dhak maintain a stature in the community as ritual celebrants specially chosen for their musical avocations. In one village of southern Rajasthan, Undri, the senior dhak player and chanter is Punaji Pargi (see Figure 3). He is the brother of the head bhopa. the late Nathu Pargi. Recounting his lifetime association with the dhak and with the Devi Ambajagaran, Punaji Pargi described to me his own initiation as a bhopa: it resulted from a severe childhood fever in which his life was spared on the condition that he dedicate it to the service of Devi Amba. Noted for his prodigious memory, Punaji learned his ritual art by constant attention to his elders, specifically to an uncle who was a well-respected chanter before him. Punaji, like all bhopas, does not keep a drum at home for practice nor did he first learn the chant through any specific, didactic process. The dhaks always remain in their enclosure at the devra until they are to be played at appropriate rituals. The art of dhak playing is passed down through observation, not instruction. While Punaji is recognized by Undri villagers for what we would call "talent," he is not praised for his artistic expression, nor for his technique, though these are exemplary. His ritual function as a bhopa is to drum. It is clear that his chanting and his drumming represent the traditional</page><page sequence="8">66 Asian Music: Fall/Winter 2000/2001 old ways, and represent the language and culture of the adivasi world in the old feudal state of Mewar. Within his own community, Punaji is acknowledged as the most knowledgeable drummer and chanter of the Devi Amba narrative, but this is not a special distinction that singles him out from his kin and fellow bhopas. His brothers and cousins each have their own ritual specialties as well. In other words, a special ability or avocation for ritual music confers no special social prominence but is considered of equal ritual status to any other function performed by the bhopa brotherhood. The iconic drum, not its player, is the centrally important feature of the ritual. ?? ?I, ?, ?c, ?,, ? d P q ; I i; t r r r ,t Figure 3: Bhopa Puna Pargi Mina playing the dhak; village Undri, tehsil Girva, Udaipur, Rajasthan (1982). The Origin of the Dhak The centrality of the dhak is beautifully illustrated in the story of Devi Amba. In one canto of the narrative, both the drum and its first player, Dharua Bhil, the "Bhil from Dhar" (in Madhya Pradesh), are suddenly elevated to iconic status. In a canto that recounts the rebirth of agriculture after a devastating famine, Devi Amba, at her palace on Mala Devala mountain, teaches the other devis the art of sprouting seeds. It is a scene reminiscent of Frazer's (1963: 397-99) classic description, in The Golden</page><page sequence="9">Roche: Hourglass Drum in Rajasthan 67 Bough, of the "gardens of Adonis." It is also a common motif throughout the Mediterranean world and wherever the Great Goddess ceremonial complex survives. Her planting is accompanied by the sound of large dhol (barrel) and nagara (kettle) drums. Devi Amba notices that the smaller dhak drum is without a player and so conceives a plot to entrap the unwary Dharua Bhil for the role. Two other devis, Rambu and Hulan, change themselves into hedgehogs and begin to gobble up the grain in Dharua's fields. Chasing after them, he runs unsuspectingly into a deep, pitch-black cave in hot pursuit. As he reaches the back of the cave, he becomes dazzled and blinded by the suddenly illuminated brilliance of Devi Amba on her throne, surrounded by her court of divinities. Paralyzed by fear, Dharua begs for his life. Disregarding his groveling, Devi Amba presents him with the dhak. He is ordered to chant the miracles of Devi Amba for nine nights (today called nobarta; i.e., nortan, or navaratri [in Hindi], and celebrated annually). In a state of panic, Dharua stammers that he is unable to comply. Devi Sharda, sitting at the right side of Devi Amba, leans forward and slaps Dharua firmly on his left cheek. From that timeless, signifying moment in Mina cultural history, Dharua gains complete musical comprehension and memory. [The following passage is a translation of the relevant lines from cantos 14 and 15 of the Devi Amba narrative relating to the origin of the first dhak player, Dharua Bhil. The chanters were bhopas Puna, Amar and Vesa Pargi. Recorded by David Roche, in situ, at the mai sat jagaran of February 18, 1983, at Ina Gor devra, Undri].

First, the dhak exists, a priori, in this telling. It is part of the ritual equipment already in place at Devi Amba's palace at Mala Devala. The scenario, in keeping with the entire narrative to this point, is one of recovering a lost tradition and revitalizing it, symbolic perhaps of the actual process of Sakta revitalization of local devi rituals, pre-1000 C.E. in central India. Early cantos of the Devi Amba narrative suggest that the revitalization occurred in response to a devastating famine and a re-peopling of the earth, an all-too-common occurrence in dry Rajasthan as in other parts of monsoon-dependent South Asia. In other words, the narrative encapsulates historical reality whose specific chronology is lost in myth. Second, the devis need a human drummer in order to celebrate nobarta. The drummer is essential to the ritual. But who is the drummer? Though described as a subsistence farmer who falls asleep while watching his fields (a South Asian Rip Van Winkle), more importantly, given the ethnicity of the present day bhopas chanting the tale, he is identified as Dharua Bhil, i.e., a Bhil from Dhar. Dhar district in Madhya Pradesh lies southeast of Undri and Udaipur district in southern Rajasthan, a distance of well over two hundred miles. None of the bhopas in Undri in 1982 knew of or had visited Dhar, nor were they aware of the magnificent palatial ruins at Mandu, south of the city of Dhar, a court culture highly influential in the region for centuries.-</page><page sequence="12">70 Asian Music: Fall/Winter 2000/2001 While the imagery illuminating the chasing of the devis-disguised- as-hedgehogs into a cave has distinct underworld overtones,12 what is most interesting is the role of Devi Sharda, devi of the Himalayas and an alternate name for Sarasvati, patroness of learning, as the divine music teacher. Devi Amba, as the supreme queen of the devis in Mina reckoning, does not directly intervene but allows her devi "Minister of Culture" to impart instruction with one whack of her hand. The functional hierarchy at the divine court of devis, like that at the Rajput court, is thus well-established and stable. The image of Dharua Bhil recoiling from the blow, magically transformed, is retained in contemporary performance practice: dhak drummers in southern Rajasthan to this day invariably perform with their heads turned sharply to the right, a body memory of the devi's primal slap. The Dhak, Icon of Devis Narrowing our focus to the ritual deployment of the drum as an icon of the devi (its principal role among the Mina) raises questions regarding its ritual role in other communities, beginning with those utilizing the drum in other adivasi communities within the Bhil culture zone. Certain parallels involving the divine origin of the drum and its affiliation with a devi establish a broad cultural pattern of signification. From rural Rajasthan to Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra come tales of iconic hourglass drums and devis. These stories are pan-adivasi within the region, and also maintain the instrument's primal iconicity signaled through rituals culminating in spirit- possession. Koppers (1948: 108-09), in his ethnography of the Bhil of Jhabua, refers to the dhak as the drum of the Zauberer ("magician" or "sorcerer") [known as barvo, in the local Bhili dialect], utilized during the "Durga- Novene" [sic] in the autumn. Played by the drummer while sitting, with the central ligature looped over his knee, the drum itself is tied to his foot in exactly the same manner as is found in southern Rajasthan. Evidently, Koppers, in the 1940s, is writing about the same drum utilized for the same jagaran-like ritual events that I witnessed in the 1980s. Koppers' assignment of the dhak to Durga, rather than Amba, may simply be a matter of confusion on his part of the Devi Durga, the so-called "Great Goddess" of Saktism. Or it may, indeed, be an accurate description of local religious practice. Koppers does mention, in a note, that the drum, also known as tak, dak, dhakli, or dhak by the Jhabua Bhil, is found among the "Bhil of Udaipur-Kherwara," the Bhilala in Barwani, and the Bhil in West Khandesh. He also notes, specifically, that it is not found among the Bhil of Ambapara. This kind of ethnographic detail is important in cultural mapping, if accurate. Koppers published a plate (1948:#5, photo 4) with a caption indicating that the dhak depicted in the photograph was collected from a member of the Korku (a Munda adivasi community) of Chikalda tehsil, Madhya Pradesh; again, an important ethnographic detail. The dhak</page><page sequence="13">Roche: Hourglass Drum in Rajasthan 71 described by Koppers was made of sivan or a local black teak, known variously in the Bhili-speaking area as hagun, sagun, or sag (Tectona grandis), as is the case for the Mina dhak to the west of Jhabua. Jungblut (1943:59-70), a Catholic missionary mentored by the missionary-ethnographer Koppers, presents the myth of the origin of the Jhabua Bhil dhak, associated exclusively with the Damor lineage, in a synopsis titled "Eagle Girl and Seven Daughters." The central motif of the story involves the creation of the dhak by seven devi sisters, acting as the first barvos, in order to control diseases spread by other devis in the district of Dhar, (n.b., the home district of Dharua Bhil in the Undri Mina version given above). The story of the drum's origin and its first performance (as dance accompaniment) touches on themes that remain integral elements of pilgrimage performance today among such neighboring communities as the Balai in Nimar (a designated "scheduled caste," see below) and the Gond adivasis further to the southeast in the Dravidian language zone. The section titled "the story of the drum" is translated by Jungblut (1943:67) as follows: ...they [the seven devi sisters -- Hunwara, Patwara, Dudhwara, Katwi, Kazal, Luli Langri, and Hulagar] all went to a gardener and said: "Give us the yellow flower-tree of your garden." He said: "Why should I give you the yellow flower-tree of my garden? It is still green." They went off (from there) and having departed they rolled some bodydirt and of it they made some white ants, which they put between the roots (of that tree). (Then) they said to the gari ["cattleherder" caste]: "If you've got a hide, give it to us." (One) says: "I've got no hide." Now they sent diseases among the goats. All the goats suddenly died of phatakri ["hoof and mouth disease"?]; also the yellow flower-tree of that garden dried up. Hereupon the gardener said: "If it is of any service to you, take it." They went back and cut it. They made a dhak of it. The gari people said: "If a hide is of any service to you, take it along: many goats have died." They went and brought a hide. They brought it, tightening it across the drum. -- Now all the sisters took up the thought: Let us go to Dhar to give a performance. The dangerous power of devis is emphasized here in Jungblut's rendering -- devis able to shrivel trees and wipe out herds, devis who need to be propitiated and treated with respect, lest they do great harm. Most importantly, they are devis who require a drum for ritual performance, a dhak. Just to the south of Jhabua, across the Narmada River and still within the Bhil culture zone, lie the two Nimar districts (East and West),</page><page sequence="14">72 Asian Music: Fall/Winter 2000/2001 predominantly populated by multi-caste villages, rather than the majority adivasi villages that are often found in Jhabua and parts of southern Rajasthan. One of the most populous groups resident in the Nimars, the Balai (or Balahi), are traditional weavers and animal-skinners. Stephen Fuchs, in his ethnography of the Balai (1950), presents a synopsis of an origin myth for the dhak drum and links it with actual ritual practice of that time. In the Balai cult of Dhaj Mata ("mother"), the dhak is presented to four Balais by Surasa, mother of the Nagas (Snake Dynasty), who is also considered to be the daughter of the demon, Dhaulagir. In an episode clearly indicating cross-referencing from the mainstream canonical Hindu text, the Ramayana, Ravana orders his female guard Surasa to watch Sita, the abducted wife of Rama, imprisoned in his fortress at Lanka. Surasa is tricked by the monkey king and Rama-ally, Hanuman, into opening her mouth wide. Hanuman changes into a squirrel and leaps between her teeth, then sails out her ear. Having gotten past her, Hanuman turns and cuts her to shreds with his sword. Next, flying over South Asia, Hanuman scatters her flesh and bones. Part of her spine falls at the foot of the meditating divinity, Siva Mahadev, in the Satpura Range (Mahadev Hills) near present- day Pachmarhi, Madhya Pradesh, almost the exact center of the sub- continent and, significantly, a common border for the three major adivasi culture zones of middle India: Bhil, Gond, and Munda. Another part of her spine falls in Lanka, causing Surasa to revive. She pleads desperately with Siva to return the missing part of her spine, but he claims total ignorance of the whole affair: After that, Surasa called four Balahis [sic.], dressed them in red dancing garments, and gave them two drums [dhaks] and a brass plate [thali]. (1950: 250 ) The four Balais go on their way, searching for the missing section of Surasa's spine, all the way to Pachmarhi (a distance of approximately 225 miles from West Nimar district). On their travels they play the dhaks and thali and carry a ritual 16-foot bamboo pole, the dhaj [derived from Sanskrit dhvaj, "pole"], which gives the sect its name and represents the part of Surasa's spine that fell on Pachmarhi. Fuchs' account of the Balai origin myth that became the basis for a lengthy origin myth performance pilgrimage is a further demonstration of the connection of ritually iconic implements (the dhak, thali and dhaj, in this case) with a female divinity, this time, the ogre Surasa. Furthermore, the search for the missing section of Surasa's spine is reminiscent of Tantric Sakta philosophical treatises with their important focus on the chakras (energy centers) linked along the spinal column. The Balai pilgrimage may, in fact, be an annual re-enactment of these teachings, a finding not antithetical to the idea that Sakta thematic material can be found in the Devi Amba narrative, as performed in southern Rajasthan.</page><page sequence="15">Roche: Hourglass Drum in Rajasthan 73 Fuchs describes the commencement of the pilgrimage from the town of Kandhwa, in West Nimar, where the sacred dhaj is kept by an elite-caste Bharuri Ahir family, i.e., by a non-Balai, a relationship once again indicative of hierarchical acculturative social processes in South Asia. However, the officiating priest is a local Balai youth, who, in the past, is said to have been ritually sacrificed to the service of Surasa, another theme with links to the Mina example. A secret ceremony sets the pilgrimage in motion as the musicians, known here as bhagats, shout "Mahadev ki jai" ("Victory to Mahadev") while others blow on the sing (an S-shaped bugle) and beat hourglass-shaped drums with lizard-skin heads. Fuchs further reports that the pilgrimage terminates at the Mahadev temple at Pachmarhi, the pilgrimage group having wended its way, dancing and singing, for many weeks over a great distance, a major sacrifice in terms of human effort. While not as closely linked as the adivasi traditions from Jhabua and Undri, this Balai pilgrimage contains many similar elements in yet another local variant form. Its additional references to more elite Hindu religious traditions and caste society may also indicate mutual acculturative practices now integrated into ritual practice by several communities. The origin of a second Balai goddess sect, that of Kati ("Cotton") Mata, also mentioned by Fuchs (1950:260 ff), is particularly noteworthy for its demonstration of exactly these same kinds of acculturative continuities. The Kati Mata sect is considered by its devotees to be the older of the two devi traditions in Nimar since, as the argument goes among caste traditionalists, Dhaj Mata must not be a Balai devi if her iconic pole is now kept by an Ahir. The myth of Kati Mata's origin, as with Dhaj Mata, also features a thematic interpolation from the Ramayana. In the central myth, summarized by Fuchs, Kati Mata is the sister of Ravana who, after quarreling with him at Holi, throws herself onto the bonfire, a clear variant on the mainstream Hindu story of Holika and the origin of the springtime Holi festival. Ravana runs to gather her bones. When he touches them, they turn into a bamboo pole and a branch of the pala.s tree (known, rather significantly, as the dhak, Butea monosperma, ["flame of the forest" because of its bright red flowers, red being the color of the devi's sari in iconic depictions], considered to be an adivasi axis mundi). Ravana throws them away angrily, thinking them worthless, but a Balai, secretly looking on, takes them home convinced of their great magical power. In a dream, Kati Mata appears to the Balai and says, "Why did you pick up my bones? Now that you have done so, you shall worship me by a yearly sacrifice." Kati Mata teaches the appropriate ritual performance to the Balai, a performance featuring an iconic pair of sticks (of Butea monosperma) crossed and tied with red cloth, topped with attached peacock feathers and referred to as "the mata's hair," and the iconic dhak hourglass drum and thali. All of these ritual materials, or variations, can be found in the Mina ritual of the Devi Ambajagaran in southern Rajasthan as well.</page><page sequence="16">74 Asian Music: Fall/Winter 2000/2001 What links these Balai goddess sects is a set of common features: the iconic pole, the dancing costumes and dances, the closing ceremony on Sivaratri ("Siva's night," a bacchanalian holiday with perhaps a more distinctive linking to Sakta rituals than most), the myths of origin involving a connection to Ravana, the dismemberment and magical restoration of a devi and, not the least for our organological purposes, the important and iconic dhak and thali percussion. The Balai examples are noteworthy since they demonstrate the principle of conservation of important cultural motifs despite significant acculturative social changes within the community. If the Balai are a mixed adivasi group that became a village service community on the lowest rungs of the caste system (almost a foregone conclusion given the evidence linking them to adivasi ritual culture on the one hand and pan-caste popular Hinduism -- the Ramayana -- on the other) the dynamics of acculturation are well-indicated by these examples of dhak within a related system of devi ritual iconicity. Fuchs (1950:322) also describes the presence of the dhak at the "Bhavani Navaratri," which includes a procession to the river to immerse the baskets of seedlings grown during the nine-day cycle. This ceremony is almost identical in structure to the Mina nobarta of southern Rajasthan. Once again we are provided proof that the local occurrences of ritual involving a devi, her icons and sympathetic fertility magic can be viewed as part of an expanded cultural current, popular culture at the village level, restricted to or "owned" by a single caste or adivasi community. To the northwest of Nimar, and bordering Jhabua and Dhar, in the neighboring districts of Panch Mahals and Vadodara (Baroda) in Gujarat, the dhak or daklo is played not only by adivasi communities apparently self- identified as Bhil, but by other more acculturated service and agricultural- caste communities. Englebert Stiglmayr (1970:18-19), reflecting on the ethnographic observations of Josef Haekel (1966:13) and his own work among the community he identifies as Rathva Bhilala, is convinced that the dhak is not the product of gesunkenes Kultur, ("sunken culture") but that, the direction of diffusion [is] more likely to be the other way around: from the tribes to the civilization. Stiglmayr bases his opinion on the fact that the Rathva myth of the drum's origin at the same time describes the parallel myth of the origin of agriculture by a culture-hero, the first barvo, who holds an iconic dhak drum in his hand. The antiquity of the drum, in his very literal reading, is taken to be co-terminus with the simultaneous Neolithic birth of agriculture. The Rathva myth of the origin of the dhak, agriculture and the barvo institution, according to Stiglmayr (1970:160), is set in the vicinity of the sacred mountain, Pavagarh, near Baroda, site of a famous Kalka Devi temple complex. According to the Rathva myth, the first barvo, who is also the first</page><page sequence="17">Roche: Hourglass Drum in Rajasthan 75 to chant the myth, is named Malka. He travels to Pavan Dungar ("divine wind mountain") with the first carpenter, Saula, to search for a dhak drum. He finds an old one, but since it lacks ligatures and drumheads, he is required to procure deerskin from his maternal uncles who turn out to be none other than the divine brothers, Ram and Laksman of the Ramayana epic. The teaching of ritual procedures to honor the devi is transmitted at Pavagarh through "trance and dreams." In a second myth, Stiglmayr (1970:173) mentions a different singer, Jibala Kunver, as the original spirit chanter who, by singing the song renews, in a mystical way, the happenings mentioned in the song. Stiglmayr (1970:146) refers also to the Bhilala origin myth of the sag tree, the black teak [Tectona grandis], from which the traditional dhak is constructed, as the "tree of blood and milk." The tree of blood and milk motif is also found in the Mina chant narrative. It is from this tree that the seven most important Bhilala cultural implements were first magically constructed. Construction of magical instruments from a tree of life again suggests a deeper, common shamanic theme across Asia. Jyotindra Jain (1984: 91-93), also reporting from the Rathva community, transcribes an episode from the myth of the Rathva culture-hero, Pithoro, descriptive of the divine construction of instruments, including the dhak. According to this myth, the carpenter Havlo makes instruments for the worship of Pithoro on the demand of the king.'3 Havlo cuts the jethi jhad (most sacred) hagun (teak tree) and, with the hide of a rojuna (antelope), he makes the nagara, dholadi and dhak drums for Raja Bhoj, who offers them up for the worship of Pithoro. Havlo, the carpenter- blacksmith of Rathva myth, is also celebrated as the maker of the first tools and the carver of the Rathva khutada (sacred wooden poles), icons of the ancestors and divinities. But very significantly and contrary to other reports among adivasi groups in the Bhil culture zone, Jain does not associate the dhak with any surviving devi ritual among the Rathva. It is, in fact, associated with Baba Ind, whom Jain identifies as the Vedic deity, Indra. However, as elsewhere, in the ritual performance of the Pithoro myth studied by Jain, the barvo becomes spirit-possessed with the playing of the dhak and the chanting. Moreover, the chant form itself is very closely related to the Mina chant. What appears to be changeable in these archaic appearing rituals are the narrative details of plot and characterization, dependent on local histories of acculturation and the social level of the community in question. The myth focuses on either a devi or a culture hero. The musical instruments and the music remain the same, or very close variants of one another, close enough for an ethnomusicologist to discern that one is listening to the same traditional music in variant melodic and rhythmic forms. Though the ancient Vedic god Indra survives triumphantly and significantly in Jain's study of ritual art of the Rathva (1994), the lack of a</page><page sequence="18">76 Asian Music: Fall/Winter 2000/2001 prominent devi figure in the main chant narrative itself (also involving extensive and elaborate wall painting) appears anomalous for an adivasi community in the Bhil culture zone. It may well be that the dhak drum has been incorporated from a parallel ritual complex into one that centers on Pithoro and Baba Ind. Or that the lineages represented in Jain's village maintained a special traditional repertoire not so prominent or entirely erased elsewhere, a situation remarkably similar to the one in Undri, mentioned above, where the Pargi lineage maintains the Devi Amba jagaran ritual exclusively. Shifting the focus farther to the west in Gujarat among other non- adivasi communities in the Bhil culture zone, Eberhard Fischer, Jyotindra Jain and Haku Shah (1982:122, plate 254) present a photograph from Hirapur, near Ahmedabad, of a dakalu hourglass drum played, along with long trumpets, by the Rawaliya caste. The same authors contend that the Bhangi caste of Mohammadpura, Gujarat, also play the dakalu. As in the other non-adivasi examples, there is no indication that the playing technique involves leg flexion. More likely, the dakalu is held in the hand and danced, as is the case with other South Asian hourglass drums. The Vaghri community of northeast Gujarat and southern Rajasthan, mentioned above, has a shared ethnic and cultural heritage with the Mina and Bhil adivasis. Like them, the Vaghris are noted for their use of the iconic dhak or daklo in devi rituals. James Campbell (1901:511-12) offers a narrative of the origin of the daklo that is also a myth of origin of the first Vaghri. The myth, as summarized by Campbell, begins with Vihat Devi tricked and defeated by an evil king and entombed on the coast of Bharuch (southwest of Baroda) at the mouth of the Narmada River. While entombed, from the sweat of her breasts, Vihat made a man and gave him the small hourglass-shaped daklo or Vaghri spirit- compelling drum. At the sound of the drum, the entombed Vihat began to sway backwards and forwards like one possessed till the Kakaria bastion [where she was entombed] shook and burst in two. In a related Vaghri myth, Vihat Devi lies sleeping for twelve years. Meanwhile, a buffalo demon tricks Siva Mahadev into giving him extraordinary powers, a local variant of the famous canonical Hindu Mahisasuramardini story associated with Durga. Mahadev, concerned over the potential destructive power of the buffalo demon, sends the Vaghri drummer, the man "made of Vihat's sweat," to waken the goddess and ask her to relieve him from his difficulty. The drummer carried a pair of khakra (Butea monosperma) leaves which by the power of Mahadev turned</page><page sequence="19">Roche: Hourglass Drum in Rajasthan 77 into a daklo or hourglass-shaped drum. At the sound of the drum, Vihat awoke... The nature of this awakening (jagara) is commemorated during the ritual performance of the myth, characterized by spirit-possession. But Campbell (1901:514) refers not to an oracular spirit-possession ceremony, as is more common among the Mina, but to an exorcism rite, almost shamanistic in nature: They believe that their daklo or hourglass-shaped drum has power to force the possessing spirit to give its name and state on what terms it will leave the possessed. The Vaghris then, despite the possible difference in ritual function, like the neighboring Mina, have a long history as the chosen musicians of the devi. Their myth of the origin of the daklo from a sacred tree and the establishment of their ancestors as the first drummers has an exact parallel in the Mina episode from the Devi Amba narrative cited above, and echoes episodes already mentioned above from Jhabua, Dhar, Panch Mahals and Vadodara, the heart of the Bhil culture zone. Needless to say, this confluence of similar narrative themes throughout the Bhil culture zone is noteworthy, if not definitive for a thesis suggesting unitary ritual activity featuring a nearly identical iconic hourglass drum and similar chant and drumming patterns but with variants in narrative detail and characterization. That this thesis represents new scholarship -- dredged up through a combination of archival research and ethnomusicological field-work -- points to the appalling dearth of documentation regarding regional and ethnic cultural histories for non-elite communities in South Asia. Hopefully, it points toward an area ripe for further research for those wishing to fully articulate South Asian history by documenting and collating extant oral traditions. Contemporary urban Vaghris in Ahmedabad continue to produce an important iconographic ritual textile known as the matani pachedi, a block- printed, white-cotton sheet covered with anthropomorphic figures painted in red alizarin and black iron-oxide colors and hung as a chandarva (canopy roof) for a temporary temple ritually constructed for the worship of Devi Amba. The Vaghris also act as bhopas in this worship. The central figure of Devi Amba is hand-painted and is flanked by horizontal printed panels depicting her miracles. One panel, seen on a traditional matani pachedi from the 1930s [Dhamija (1985:82-83)], portrays a procession of musicians trailing a sacrificial bull. The procession is led by a bhopa carrying an urn to catch the blood, his sword raised overhead. Immediately behind the bull, a bhopa playing the dhak or daklo is shown striking the drumhead with a curved drumstick.</page><page sequence="20">78 Asian Music: Fall/Winter 2000/2001 With this final example from the ethnographic literature, we end our organological journey tracing the dhak among adivasi and ancillary service caste communities (the Balai and Vaghri) within the contemporary Bhil culture zone, i.e., in districts where Bhili language is still spoken and adivasis make up if not a majority, then a near majority of the population. It is fitting that this portion of the story ends in Ahmedabad, the largest city and commercial hub of western India north of Mumbai and home to thousands of migrant adivasi families. Hourglass Tension Drums Among Non-Minas Within the Bhil Culture Zone Shifting our geographic focus slightly from its center in southern Rajasthan among the Mina and then to the districts of the Bhil culture zone, to contiguous districts and then to regions of South Asia as a whole, reflects a methodological design that should be viewed primarily as organizational, not ethnocentric and diffusionist. While geographic, historical and ethnic patterns can emerge from the known data regarding the distribution of the hourglass drum known as the dhak or other similar names, the idea of pinpointing a specific place and time of origin is an ultimately futile exercise in South Asia with its dearth of historical records on non-perishable materials. On the other hand, locating the dhak hourglass drum, with its ritually iconic role, in the heart of contemporary adivasi territory is not meaningless or simply convenient. In the immediate vicinity of the Rajput-era (ca. 900-1100 C.E.) temple town of Jagat and its temple dedicated to Devi Amba near the city of Udaipur in southern Rajasthan, it is only the Mina who have the dhak. But farther away, in all directions, other communities have hourglass drums used for ritual purposes other than the invocation of a devi figure. The specific example noted earlier was in the nominally adivasi Rathva community. For example, from northern Rajasthan, Komal Kothari (1977:10; 1982:22; 1984:5) describes the deru, the hourglass drum held in the left hand and played with the right (without a stick), associated with the Goga Cauhan epic. It is played by great numbers of men at the Gogaji Mela held at Ganganagar near the Rajasthan-Panjab-Pakistan border. Although the performers of the Goga epic are unspecified in Kothari's texts, it is assumed that they are from the "Gujar, Jat, Gayari and tribal Bhil" communities present at the fair. Gujars, Nayaks, Thoris and other professional caste musicians, including "Gayari, Kumhar, Mali, Bhand, Turi, Bhat and Balai" perform a second epic, the Dev Narayan or Bagravat,14 also accompanied by the hand-held hourglass drum, but in this case known as dhak, according to Kothari. Both of these epics involve culture heroes, eulogized by caste musicians.</page><page sequence="21">Roche: Hourglass Drum in Rajasthan 79 In other words, as with Jain's Rathva example from Gujarat, in Rajasthan as well, the functional use of the dhak appears to have been de- linked from devi ritual. In this case from northern Rajasthan, the dhak may have been transferred at some point from a ceremonial performance cycle instrument to one accompanying the historical, epic entertainment cycle of culture heroes, as common to Rajput-dominated, multi-caste society -- that is, if the dhak can be considered originally a Mina instrument. For the Mina community of Jaipur and Alwar districts, as Kothari notes, it is the devi, rather than a culture hero, who is the focus of ritual attention. This is an important distinction in linking an ethnic relationship between the northern Rajasthan Minas and the Mina of Udaipur and other districts of southern Rajasthan. It also, once again, links the dhak to the devi. Kothari questions the commonly held supposition in Rajasthan that the Mina have been influenced by the oral traditions of outside, higher-status groups and that the dhak, which accompanies these oral traditions, is a non-adivasi instrument. Attributing the dhak drum to non-adivasi sources, as is generally assumed, obscures the possibility of the reverse being true: that the direction of transmission for the dhak drum may in fact be just the opposite -- from adivasi to non-adivasi.'5 Rashid Ahmed Pahari (personal communication), a folklorist working in the Kota district of eastern Rajasthan, claims that, in the Kota district, the Gujars play the dhak (without the thali) to accompany the "Hiraman" epic (named for the Gujar culture hero, Hir), while the Koli and Kachi agriculturalist castes chant "Mataji" stories with dhak accompaniment at Navaratri. Jyotindra Jain (personal communication) also mentions the existence of a Navalakha ("900,000") Devi Temple in eastern Rajasthan where Gujar caste musicians play the dhak. In other words, given all the evidence gathered here from ethnographic accounts, the use of the dhak in the service of the devi should not be considered an exclusively adivasi cultural trait. By the same token, the culture-hero performance form cannot be considered an exclusively non- adivasi trait either. Perhaps the most consistently logical conclusion that may be drawn from this panoply of referents is the truism that certain culture groups within the Bhil culture zone area and beyond perform epics and/or ritual music in honor of the devi, such as Devi Amba in southern Rajasthan, or to honor caste culture-heroes, such as Goga Cauhan of the Gujars and Pithoro of the Rathvas. These performances are accompanied on the dhak or deru, and the proliferation of such performances may indicate a South Asian cultural nexus centered on ritual ceremonial performance utilizing an iconic hourglass drum. Further ethnographic research in other regions of South Asia corroborates this view of specific instrument iconicity and local or regional devi/culture-hero referent.'6</page><page sequence="22">80 Asian Music: Fall/Winter 2000/2001 Making Sense of the Dhak in Local History As a historical reminder of the binary relationship of the adivasi to the Rajput, according to Tod and other accounts," we know that the adivasi chiefs of the Kotra Bhomat region, in the remote mountains southwest of Udaipur, remained powerful throughout the period in which Devi Amba became a dominant iconographic figure, during the 10th to 13th centuries. In Mewar, the principal feudal Rajput state in southern Rajasthan, the alliance between the Rajput and adivasi communities to repel Muslim and Mughal invaders has a long and checkered history. This history is coterminus with the rise (and demise, at least in regard to Rajput kuldevi or clan goddess affiliation) of Devi Amba, and is prominently and publicly acknowledged by the emblem of state adorning the Udaipur City Palace: an adivasi and a Rajput, each with signifying weapon in hand (the Rajput sword and the adivasi bow-and-arrow). The two stalwarts stand side-by-side, a partnership surely suggesting reciprocity. Similar alliances, indicative of the close, if not exploitative, relationship between the two communities, were no doubt common throughout the Bhil culture zone. The point to remember here is that both Rajput and adivasi communities revered and continue to revere devis. The relationship of one group to the other is best explained as paradigmatic of South Asian cultural reciprocity generally, i.e., a processual, dynamic model for framing an ongoing discourse on acculturation and political and economic hegemony. What light does this sidebar on Mewar ethnic history shed on the history of ritual performance employing the iconic dhak? Are we convinced that a unicultural ritual complex was once shared by what appear to be multiple ethnicities in the region, a ritual that now survives only among local adivasis? Certainly, the dance pavilion at the historic Amba temple at Jagat and the ceremonies held there must have influenced the ritual practices of the surrounding villages during the period of its greatness, regardless of their social and economic distance from royal celebration. But the reverse is also possible: since a local kuldevi may have been elevated to become the regional Devi Amba patronized by Rajputs and wealthy merchants, her traditional form of worship, including the deployment of a ritual drum, may have accompanied her hypergamous ascent. Were Mina bhopas the temple drummers at Jagat for Sakta rituals? Was the ritual ur-text at the Jagat temple an earlier form of the Devi Amba narrative as it has been preserved in southern Rajasthan, as I recorded it in its entirety at the devra in Undri? Was the iconic dhak the principal instrument played by adivasi musicians at this temple at that time? The search for an unimpeachable bit of corroborating evidence regarding the origin of the dhak, its drummers, and its role in historic ritual performance at Jagat remains richly, if mysteriously, suggestive -- another Indian labyrinth.</page><page sequence="23">Roche: Hourglass Drum in Rajasthan 81 A Bigger Picture: South Asian Hourglass Drums in the Ethnographic and Historical Record The double-headed tension hourglass drum struck with a stick and accompanying devi worship (as opposed to the iconographically "classic" pellet rattle drum, the damaru, associated with Siva) survives among lower class, caste musicians of southern India, the western Himalayas, and Nepal. It survives as well among the adivasis and other service or agricultural castes like the Balai, Gujar and Vaghri of the Bhil culture zone, discussed above. In all cases, the iconicity of the hourglass drum signs the material embodiment of Jakti.'8 The idea of iakti as an invisible force iconizing a musical instrument (or other ritual object) has a long heritage in South Asia. The dhak's association as a sakti materialization may also explain its connection to non- devi rituals among the adivasi communities of the Bhil culture zone since Jakti is not an exclusive power but takes polymorphic shape. It is animation. The multiple referencing of Jakti may also explain if not its conceptual origin in adivasi and menial service caste communities, then its borrowing from formal Tantric Saktism back into the sacred music repertoire of other adivasi and service castes for ceremonial occasions. Whatever the direction of acculturation, it is the Jakti of the instrument itself that helps to define the event as sacred. But Jakti, for the Mina of southern Rajasthan, resides not only in its materialization, in the form of ritual implements made iconic, but immaterially in the spirit world in general, among the multitude of spirits of whatever rank, be they ancestors or divinities. Spirits are considered to be pure, invisible slakti. These spirits, it should be remembered, may be invoked and humanly embodied by the playing of an hourglass drum. Sakti is brought down into the human body. From the evidence at the ancient temple town of Jagat, the phenomenon of the dhak as an icon manifesting Jakti in rituals that are dedicated to Devi Amba certainly has an historical date ante quem at some period during the renaissance of Tantric practices, among the Sakta sect. That sect itself has been succinctly defined in acculturative terms as "the result of a fusion between brahmanical religion and tribal or folk religions... [with the] absorption of aboriginal mother goddesses..," by Nandi (1973:171). In other words, the antiquity of the devi as an indigenous divinity seems unassailable. Why not then the idea of the dhak, the hourglass drum, as indigenous and therefore an iconic survival among contemporary adivasis? Unfortunately, locating a verifiable date of origin for the dhak from the archaeological record at specific Tantric Sakta ritual sites across medieval South Asia must remain conjectural, linked to the</page><page sequence="24">82 Asian Music: Fall/Winter 2000/2001 dating of temple iconography in general. This is to say, the dhak associated with Devi Amba in the Bhil culture zone may date from the turn of the first millennium C.E., but the dhak associated with other divinities may precede or follow that date by centuries. The hourglass drum throughout South Asia is generally found today among communities who maintain its ritual use with a tenacity born, I believe, from a faith in the drum's continuing iconic potency or from the strength of a functioning system of caste service reciprocity in which the drummers maintain a crucial role. It is also instructive to note the presence, absence or disappearance of the hourglass drum, particularly in any areal study mapping instruments from the musical cultures of other adivasi populations of middle India beyond the Bhil culture zone, i.e., among communities of the Gond and Munda culture zones. In doing so, an important piece of the puzzle is revealed. The iconic singularity of the hourglass drum among adivasi communities in the Bhil culture zone, at least up through the 1980s, appears to be an inexplicable anomaly contra- indicating any idea of pan-adivasi performance practice.19 Claiming origin for the drum as part of an all-adivasi cultural pattern appears suspect from the evidence of our data, incipient as it may be given the dearth of organological studies in middle India. Other commentators have confidently assigned the hourglass drum in this region to non- indigenous social institutions that entered the Bhil culture zone during the medieval period. Koppers (1940/41: 806), for instance, is adamant that the hourglass drum among the Bhil of Jhabua district derived from an "outside" influence, i.e., Saktism, by which he implies high-caste Hindu ritual of the Rajput Kingdoms Era. Rahmann (1959:726), unfamiliar with the evidence from the Bhil culture zone, unknowingly reaches the same conclusion as Koppers by voicing an identical theme from the opposite perspective. Rahmann believes that the rarity of the hourglass drum among most indigenous tribes of middle India is due to the "comparatively weak influence exerted on these tribes by Shaktism [sic]." In other words, by this reckoning, the presence or lack of the drum indicates the influence or lack of influence of Saktism among adivasis of middle India. While this argument has great merit on the surface, it is an oversimplification to assume that adivasi musical culture equates to primitive or naively simple musical culture lacking in sophistication, i.e., uninfluenced by such elite cultural trends as Saktism. For instance, the unique style of drumming and the evidence of other equally complex, ceremonial musical instruments throughout the Bhil culture zone are indicative of the subtlety and sensitivity of adivasi musical culture. Whatever the origin of the hourglass drum in South Asia, the adivasis of the Bhil culture zone have nurtured its development as a ceremonial musical instrument, developed a unique playing technique for it, and kept it sacred as an important signifying</page><page sequence="25">Roche: Hourglass Drum in Rajasthan 83 icon. The fragility and survivability of such a unique cultural contribution as the dhak hourglass drum and its performance practice by the most adept Mina bhopas does not guarantee its continued existence beyond the lifetimes of the present generation. How it changes and transmutates, or disappears, perhaps never to resurface, must, necessarily, remain a re-study for the future. Sonoma State University Rohnert Park, California Notes [The omission of most diacritical markings throughout the body of the article and notes, with the exception of footnote 1, follows the request of the author and is intended to both promote readability and to de- emphasize the primacy of literary rather than oral authority. Pronunciations in Bhili, for example, vary widely from perceived Sanskrit-based norms.] Regarding the etymology of the word dhak (a1"r) in Bhili, there are multiple referents. Bhili is an Indo-European language, the only one of that family spoken by a designated adivas-i group as their primary, native language in South Asia (Gondi is a Dravidian language, Munda is an Austroasiatic one). From Sanskrit, Monier-Williams (1964:431) lists as one of the variants dhakka, "a large drum," i.e., the ancestor of the Bengali elongated barrel drum of the same name. Other associated terms include dhakkari, an epithet of the goddess Tara, another example of the association of a major goddess figure to an iconic drum, the gajadlhakka, "a kettle-drum carried on an elephant," and the jayadhakka, "a large drum of victory." In contemporary Hindi usage, Chaturvedi and Tiwari (1975:272) list dhak as "the tree Buteafrondosa," i.e., Butea monosperma. This tree is also known as palas, the "Flame of the Forest," featuring bright red flowers that blossom in the late spring. It should be noted that the traditional emblematic sari color for Devi Amba, Durga, and many other devis, more than a coincidence, is also red, like the dhack flowers. Tod (1971:32) states that the hills of southern Rajasthan, all the way to Dungarpur and Salumbar, now largely denuded, were covered with "deep forests" of bamboo and dhazk in the early 19th century when Tod was the local British regent. Direct etymological reference to the dhak as a drum in Rajasthan remains elusive. Even the Sakariya's Rajasthani-Hindi dictionary (1984:I, 521) has no entry for dhajk indicating a drum, although dhakko is given as "a big dhol" or "nagara." There is not a single reference to an hourglass-shaped drum of this name. 2 Augustine (1986:16) tabulates the following demographic information about the seven most populous "scheduled tribe"-inhabited districts of southern Rajasthan from the Census of India 1981: District Total population Tribal population %Tribal Udaipur 2,356,959 809,156 34.33 Kota 1,559,759 231,316 14.83 Bhilwara 1,310,379 121,664 9.18</page><page sequence="26">84 Asian Music: Fall/Winter 2000/2001 Chitorgarh 1,232,494 223,864 18.16 Banswara 886,608 643,966 72.63 Dungarpur 682,845 440,026 64.44 Sirohi 542,049 125,245 23.11 The densest tribal pocket in this region, Kushalgarh tehsil (subdistrict) of southern Banswara district, lists tribal communities as constituting 91.31% of the population. The greatest number of "scheduled tribals" by tehsil is found with the 118,182 community members from Kherwara in Udaipur district (72.72% of the total). The greatest density of "tribals" in Udaipur district can be found in Kotra tehsil with 86.68% of the total population. Ethnographic accounts of Bhil and Mina tribal communities in Udaipur district include those written by Hendley (1875), Carstairs (1954), McCurdy (1964), J.K. Doshi (1974), and Kumar (1984). For Sirohi and the Udaipur district borderlands, Dave's study of the Garasia (1960) confirms their cultural connection to neighboring Bhil and Mina communities. Chauhan (1967) adds ethnographic information from Chitorgarh district. S.C. Doshi's sociological study (1978) refers to tribal communities of Dungarpur and Banswara, as does N.N. Vyas's (1980) important study of sagri (bonded labor) among tribal communities in the same area. Just as the politically loaded term "scheduled tribe" demands further explanation, the names of the "tribes" themselves remains problematic. Most of the ethnographic monographs written on tribal populations in Udaipur district reference the Bhil as the primary tribal population. However, the Mina, better known as a powerful tribal constituency farther north, in Jaipur and Alwar districts, have a) either moved south in great numbers since earlier census accounts, b) have been misnamed in poor census accounting of the past, or c) have appeared on the current census reports due to fictive naming strategies practiced by formerly Bhil tribals who wish to associate with the more strategically, politically powerful Mina, or who wish to right the record. Clan names among the Bhil and Mina indicate identical surnames for the most part and may, in fact, mark marriage alliances between two once-separate tribes in southern Rajasthan, if the naming has not been totally fictive. However, socially hypergamous strategies involving political decisions made by the community leaders to rename themselves as a social unit to distinguish themselves from more rural relatives of lesser social status remain an important technique in hierarchical South Asia. In Undri, the central village in southern Rajasthan where this study was conducted, all the tribal families add "Mina" to their given and surnames on legal documents, a widespread practice in the area, despite the insistence of local ethnographers and the general population in the city of Udaipur to identify them colloquially as Bhil. Kosambi (1970), a polymath Sanskritist and authority on numismatics, utilised this terminology to indicate an acculturation process marked by reciprocity, while referencing the political economy of colonial relationships between stronger and weaker elements. In regard to animistic religious beliefs, the idea that an older population at a continuously sacred location has better access to the deities and ancestor spirits of place remains a continuing system of belief in rural South Asia. As an example of Kosambi's process of reciprocal acculturation, though that term and its author are not referenced explicitly, Sontheimer's description of the transformation of a chthonic snake deity into the form of three contemporary gods (Biroba, Mhaskoba, and Khandoba) in the Maharashtra region is especially instructive. "Sadhus, Gosavis, Brahmans, and the influence of tribal rulers, rather than destroying the cult, add new layers of imagery... By emulating the</page><page sequence="27">Roche: Hourglass Drum in Rajasthan 85 model of the rulers, the Khandoba cult spread into even the smallest villages... An essential characteristic of Indian culture makes itself felt: new notions and images, often those belonging to an upwardly mobile dominant group, are taken over without the old ones being given up. Thus original notions are retained in the cults, although they may be reinterpreted: that is 'Brahmanized' or 'Ksatriya-ized.' There often arise endless 'contradictions' between notions about the original deity on the one hand -- still found at their purest among the residents of forest and pasture areas and among the lower classes in established settlements and on the other hand, the deity as he has emerged under the influence of the new notions." (Sontheimer 1989:205). 4 The term adivasi ("first inhabitant," i.e., aboriginal), is a coined Sanskritized political term now found (from 1980) in common usage among tribal populations in southern Rajasthan. It replaces the British colonial term "scheduled tribe" in most political discourse. First popularized in the 1940s by A.V. Thakkar, a social worker in the Chotanagpur region of Bihar, it came to be accepted by tribal populations across middle India as a non-pejorative term to generically describe themselves. See Hardiman (1987:11-17) and Roche (1996:xxiii-xxviii) for more complete discussions. The adivasi population of India, over 400 designated communities, is estimated at 8% of the total population, or approximately 67 million individuals, according to 1991 figures. ' See Thompson and Balys (1958: 122) for listings of Motif D1211, "magic drum," common to adivasi tales collected in middle India, according to data in the citation. 6 Warrior and fertility goddess worship has a history in South Asia that reaches back at least to the Neolithic. Steatite seals found at Harappan sites (ca. 2500 B.C.E.), for example, depict thin-waisted, heavy-breasted females strongly reminiscent of similar female icons of the Minoan culture and pan-West Asian Great (Grain) Goddess sects of later millennia. While it remains conjectural to imagine a direct link from the past to the present and from the Mediterranean to the mountains of southern Rajasthan (pending definitive translation of the Harappan script, among other intangibles) the jagaran performance of the Devi Amba narrative, at the very least, suggests a local staging of a much older ritual complex form. On an etymological level, Monier-Williams (1964 [1899]:83) defines the word amba (mother) [ aMb; ] as derived from an Indo-European language. He states that "in the South Indian languages, amba is corrupted into amma and is often affixed to the names of goddesses, and females in general." The prevalence of such familiar Dravidian goddess names as Mariamma or Yelamma in western India, Mariamman and Icakkiamman in southern India, and Amman, (mother goddess of the Vedda tribe of Sri Lanka) and Kiriamma (milk mother) in the former Kandyan kingdom of central Sri Lanka, lends support to the idea that the Indo-European term references "mother" only within a certain cultural and historical context. It may be that the epithet amba, though originally referenced as a "name of Durga" (Monier-Williams, ibid.), may have referred to both virgin warrior goddesses and "mother" in non-Indo-European sources. Goddesses functioning without spouses, as in the Mina conception of Devi Amba of southern Rajasthan, represent divinity within a local ritual praxis. The prevalence of singular, warrior goddesses in adivasi communities in the Bhil culture zone, in this case, is a significant feature. Kosambi (1962:60), in a chapter entitled, "At the Crossroads: a study of mother-goddess cult sites [in Maharashtra]" reviews the origin of the name Amba in South Asia from the Vedic Era to the period of the Mahabharata: Amba, Ambika, Ambalika. All three names mean 'mother' and are connected with water by the words ambu and ambhas. One should</page><page sequence="28">86 Asian Music: Fall/Winter 2000/2001 guess that they might be river-goddesses...their names are particularly notable because of their joint invocation in the horse sacrifice...According to the Mahabharata 5.187.39-40, [Princess] Amba [of Kashi] became a river with half her body. This river is given as flowing in the Vatsa country [referencing a Vedic Aryan tribe located in the environs of present day Allahabad]; a rocky tortuous stream filled with crocodiles... The use of either of the names Amba Mata or Devi Amba encapsulates a complexity of historical acculturation forever knotted, always mysterious. The religious history of Amba as a deity is best approached at the local level. Tod (1971 [1839]), in an appendix, includes a translation of an inscription from the Hindu temple complex at Girnar in Junagadh, Gujarat (1148 C.E.), "in praise of the Goddess Amba," at a point in history where Amba was considered the kuldevi (clan goddess) of the Guhilas, the ruling Rajput clan of Mewar: The destroyer of all doubts and fears, the donor of all human desires and wishes; she who causes to be completed the designs of the devout; such Goddess Sri Mata Ambica [sic.] is the sole power whereby the prayers of mankind are fulfilled. Be praise and glory unto her! Two major historical Hindu pilgrimage sites dedicated to Devi Amba lie in the vicinity of Undri, though none of the bhopas in Undri speak of them today. The most active one, the mountain temple of Ambaji on the border of Rajasthan and Gujarat southwest of Mount Abu, is attended in droves by urban pilgrims from Ahmedabad and other parts of Gujarat. The priests are now Brahmans. A brief history of Ambaji is recounted in Forbes' annals (1924 [1856]: 398-406). He identifies the Amba worshipped there as Amba Bhavani. The Forbes account mentions adivasi devotees, as does the other 19th-century ethnographic account of tribal populations of the Kotra Bhomat region, T.H. Hendley's description of the Mewar Bhil (1875). Hendley mentions "Ambao Mata of Limbarwara" as a prominent deity. While Carstairs (1954), on the Bhil of Kotra Bhomat, and McCurdy (1964) and J.K. Doshi (1974) on the Bhil of Ratakote and Pai, fail to mention the temple site of Ambaji, P.C. Dave (1960), writing on the Garasia of Sirohi, mentions the site as an important one for that local adivasi community. The other prominent historical site, located only 28 miles southeast of Udaipur city and near the famous Zawar Mines (where the Rajput culture hero, Rana Pratap, once hid his wealth from Moghal armies), is the town of Jagat. Undoubtedly a well-known pilgrimage site at one time, the Amba temple at Jagat was also the center of musical performance activities. Sculpted musician figures adorn the walls in great numbers. Its iconographic and historical importance is described in detail in K.C. Jain's study of ancient Rajasthani towns (1972: 446-449) and in an article by R.C. Agrawala (1964). The fact that no male divinity is depicted amidst a plethora of devi figures in a temple of this stature is, in itself, a remarkable rarity in India. An important, functioning, urban Amba Devi temple exists just beyond Chandpol, the southwestern gate of the old walled city of Udaipur. This temple, on the road leading out to the adivasi territory of Kotra Bhomat, has always played a significant role in symbolically mediating between the Rajput Guhila and Sisodiya clan leaders, the denizens of the city, and the adivasi laborers of the rural hinterland. At the southern gate, it is the first temple the adivasi women woodsellers see as they trudge into the city in the early hours of the morning, piles of precious firewood balanced precariously on their heads. A new low-cost housing colony development, populated by adivasi and other service caste families, sprang up adjacent to the temple in the 1980s bearing the evocative name of "Amba Mata Scheme."</page><page sequence="29">Roche: Hourglass Drum in Rajasthan 87 The northern range of Amba's influence has been reported by Sontheimer (1989:185) to include the Mathura-Jaipur area as well. He reports encountering semi- nomadic Gujar herders on the road between these two cities who cite "Amba Bhavani" as their "primary deity." This corroborates the idea that the goddess originally enshrined by Minas at the famous "Amber" Palace outside of Jaipur was, in fact, Devi Amba in her destructive aspect of Bhavani, though she is identified in the tourist literature simply as Kali, the better known pan-Hindu goddess of destruction. Further to the south, in the geographic center of the Bhil culture zone, lies the devi-temple complex at Pavagarh, Gujarat, another mountain stronghold dedicated to Devi Kalka, the Guhila kuldevi during the Chitorgarh period. Legends surrounding historical figures associated with Rajput rule in the Panchmahals District northeast of Baroda, Gujarat, and connected to miracles associated with the Devi Kalka of Pavagarh, figure thematically in certain cantos of the Devi Amba narrative, as chanted in southern Rajasthan, as well as playing a featured part in historical, multi-caste folklore in Gujarat and western Madhya Pradesh. These themes may be cited as part of a larger devi tradition that encompasses both Devi Kalka and Devi Amba, or, as she is referred to farther north in a syncretic combination, Devi Amba Bhavani. This hybrid devi tradition may reflect an historical situation in the 14th-c. C.E. when the Guhila Rajput clan of Mewar shifted eastward to its new capitol at Chitor and changed its allegiance with Amba toward a second, newer kuldevi, Kalika. Famous battles over the next several centuries eventually forced the return of the Guhila clan, by then known as the Sisodiyas, back to their original Udaipur environs, in the late 16th-c. C.E. At that time, both Kalika and Amba Rajput kuldevis seem to have been combined into the figure of devi Ban Mata, so named for her victory over the demon Banasur. (See Harlan, 1992). 7 See Edith Turner, et al. (1992: 192) for an African point of view: "The word for 'drum' is used by most central and southern Africans as the same word 'ritual' itself... It used to be unthinkable to hold a public ritual without drumming." 8 "Bhil culture zone" signifies a concept of provenance, a sense of abiding regional cultural influence by the prominent adivasi community and adivasi language in western India. Corroboration for this terminology was first expressed to me (personal communication), by the eminent authority on Bhil ethnography, T.B. Naik, Principal of Gujarat Vidyapith, Ahmedabad. The Bhil culture zone, in my estimation, lies in the uplands of four major river drainages: the Mahi, the Sabarmati, the Narmada, and the Tapi (Tapti). From north to south, the Indian government has designated four large political divisions within this territory: Udaipur, Indore, Vadodara, and Bombay. According to the 1981 national census, the state political districts inhabited by Bhili speakers and/or communities identified as "Bhil" or some form of hyphenated Bhil (i.e., Bhil-Mina, Rathva-Bhil, Bhilala, etc.) include the following: in Rajasthan -- Udaipur, Dungarpur, Banswara, Sirohi, Chitorgarh, Bhilwara, Kota, Jhalawar, Pali, Ajmer, Jalor, and Jodhpur; in Gujarat -- Vadodara (Baroda), Panchmahals, Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, Bharuch (Broach), Dangs, Surat; in Madhya Pradesh -- Jhabua, Mandasor, Ratlam, Dhar, West Nimar, East Nimar, Dewas, Ujjain, Indore, Shahjapur, Rajgarh, Sehore; in Maharashtra -- Dhulia, Jalgaon, Nasik, Akola, Buldana, Amravati, and Aurangabad. 9 Jyotindra Jain (1973: 22) claims that the dhak found in Pratapgarh tehsil is also assembled by Dabgars of Ahar, the village adjacent to the city of Udaipur and home to its royal Rajput cenotaphs. Pottery recovered from Ahar dates back to the time of the Indus Civilization. The location of the royal cenotaphs and the traditional cremation grounds are found here, several hundred yards away from the Dabgar workshop. These drum makers today construct many types of folk and classical drums. Their dhaks appear to be turned on wood lathes. However, the old age-blackened dhaks still found in the devras of</page><page sequence="30">88 Asian Music: Fall/Winter 2000/2001 southern Rajasthan appear to be instruments hand-chiselled from single blocks of wood by makers of the past. The dhaks at Undri have been in the devra longer than any present bhopa can remember. 10 In Pratapgarh, according to Jain (1973:22), the drumstick is known as vajeno. In Dangs district, Gujarat, it is known as babali. "1 The reference to Dhar in a narrative being recited more than 200 miles away from that city is noteworthy. It should he remembered that a fully operative communications infrastructure in this part of India does not exist. The one-lane road that passes out of Udaipur city southwest to the dense adivasi regions on the way to the Kotra Bhomat was first paved only in the 1970s. More importantly, there is no direct marriage alliance system that extends beyond twelve villages distance from any single adivasi village in southern Rajasthan. In other words, geographical reference to a Bhil from Dhar remains as obscure to the older generation of bhopas in Undri today as if the reference had been made to a Bhil from Mumbai. What is important is that Dharua is the first dhak player and that he is not any anonymous Bhil from Dhar but presumably an ancestor from within the Pargi clan lineage. Yet self-defined as Minas today, the Pargis of Undri may also be referring to their own more rural past, as they sometimes refer to "wild" adivasis beyond their kinship network as rough, black-magician Bhils. Regarding the connection of contemporary Minas in southern Rajasthan to Bhils of Dhar, it is important to note that the Hindu kingdom of Dhar, in western Madhya Pradesh, was famous for producing several stellar and widely influential rulers of the Rajput Kingdoms Era. One example is Raja Bhoja (1018-1060 C.E.), a noted patron of Sanskrit learning and the "ideal Hindu prince," according to Smith (1967: 204). He is the eponymous founder of Bhopal and is referred to in Jyotindra Jain's (1984) transcription of the chants for the Rathva Pithoro ritual. Though names can be misleading (there was an equally famous Raja Bhoja at Kanauj, 840-890 C.E., for example), Jyotindra Jain corroborates this view, based on contemporary miracle chants collected in the Bhil culture zone, that indicate that the turn of the millennium was a crucial period in the history of the region. A unitary history of adivasilRajput relations may one day be reconstructed from the region of Dhar, dating from the downfall of the Dhar kingdom, which could clarify the issue. We do know that nearby, in the hills leading toward the Narmada River, the beautifully preserved 14th-c. C.E. Muslim court city of Mandu was established on the site of a former Paramara Rajput fortress (700-1200 C.E.). For the Bhil of Dhar, there seems to have been a mass exodus from the region at some period, due to loss of protection from outside enemies, inlternal famine, or war. In 1983, in adivasi villages near Mandu, what may have earlier been the site of Amba worship has now been replaced by worship to the pan-Hindu mainstream Devi, Durga, if the report of a Bhil elder met on the road while leaving Mandu was indeed accurate (personal communication). 12 Hedgehogs were considered magic animals, as evidenced by archaeological discoveries of hedgehog fetishes from the Neolithic period in eastern Europe. See Gimbutas, 1991:256-58. 13 He is undoubtedly identical to Saula, the first carpenter of the Rathva myth cited by Stiglmayr (1970: 160). The differences in dialect on the Madhya Pradesh-Gujarat- Rajasthan border may have resulted in the variation of initial consonants that continue to be spoken today. The sibilant "sa," of Hindi is replaced by the aspirate "ha" in most Bhili dialects.</page><page sequence="31">Roche: Hourglass Drum in Rajasthan 89 14 Komal Kothari (personal communication), states that the Dev Narayan/Bagravat story is identical to the hir epic sung by the Mina (he, however, identifies these singers as Bhil) of southern Rajasthan, among others. The portion of the hir that I recorded in Undri village in 1982 and the summary of the hir plot given by J.K. Doshi (1975:139), recorded from bhopa chanters in the neighboring village of Pai, does not sustain Kothari's claim, differing markedly from the summary of the Dev Narayan/Bagravat plot provided by Kothari (1980). 15 For example, the important serving girl, Hira, in the Devi Amba narrative, may have been modeled on or influenced by the character of Hira Dasi, the servant to Rani Jaimati in the Dev Narayan/Bagravat epic. Jyotindra Jain (1984), in his translation of the Pithoro story, also indicates that caste characterization is an important poetic component of the adivasi oral tradition for the Rathva. 16 As an example of the processual dynamics inherent in the theme of reciprocal acculturation relevant to this discussion, the prominence of the hourglass drum known as the hudukka at the period of the medieval Rajput Era Kingdoms, known from multiple references to it in the 13th-c. C.E. Sangitaratnakara (and later, in the 16h century Ain-i- Akbari), attests to the elevation of devi rituals to a position of royal, court-supported prominence. Abul Fazl's Ain-i-Akbari lists hurkiyas as musicians in Akbar's court. Powers (1980) cites the hudukka as the third most commonly mentioned drum of the medieval period. The drum itself, played by a male musician, is depicted in paintings of the period accompanied by female manjira (small brass hand cymbals) players. Abul Fazl refers to the hurkiyas as dhrupad singers, referencing the well-known classical vocal music of the period. The Mughal court setting, for a drum with obvious Hindu association, likely indicates Rajput cultural influence along matrilineal lines -- an historical reality with Hindu princesses wed to Mughal princes. Literary evidence preserving ritual texts of a Sakta ritual dedicated to Devi Amba or Ambika, possibly utilized in the region of the Bhil culture zone and involving the dhak, include the Il h century C.E. Jain Tantric Jambusvami carita which describes an Ambadevi rasa. The reference is cited in Vatsayan (1980:125), and is written in an early form of Gujarati. Nandi (1973:156) describes a Jain Tantric sect of Ambika which he says dates from the 7'" century C.E. He also cites Mallisenasuri's Bhairavapadmavati kalpa, chapter six, verses one and two, as descriptive of Tantric ritual in Devi Amba's service. But Kothari (personal communication) sums up the social praxis of devi ritual transmission when he reframes the entire devi/culture hero complex in terms of a metamorphic process in which family and lineage ancestors transform into spirits and eventually become divinities: males being regarded as heroes, females transforming into devis. See also Harlan (1992). 17 See Tod (1971 [1829]: 182-184), on the supposed origin of this ritual of fealty. According to Tod, the "Oondree Bhil," named "Dewa," had the privilege of holding the "salver of spices and sacred grains of rice used in making the teeka," while his companion, "Baleo," of Oguna, drew blood from an incision on his thumb to mark the ascension of the first Guhila Dynasty Rajput leader mentioned in the Mewar chronicles, Rana Bappa Rawal (ca. 728 CE). Bappa, Baleo, and Dewa were alleged companions in the forest during Bappa's hidden exile. Simply put, the connection between Rajput and adivasi is again shown to be longstanding and noteworthy in Rajasthan. A similar tale of camaraderie between a Rajput future king and his Bhil companions (and saviors) marks the history of the 16'h century C.E. prototype of the ideal Rajput prince, Rana Pratap. "8 It should be emphasized that historical speculation about the origin of the drum, its iconographic history, its development, and other musicological preoccupations, are not part of the typical bhopa's purview or vocabulary. The drum he plays is an article of</page><page sequence="32">90 Asian Music: Fall/Winter 2000/2001 faith. Many of my questions along these lines of inquiry, posed from time to time out of enthusiastic curiosity, would be deferred. The elder bhopas in Undri always restated the obvious for me: the dhak's sakti is considered a matter of simple observation. Its origin is fully described in the miracle of the establishment of the nobarta ceremony in the Devi Amba narrative, oral scripture. Mina historiography, among the elder bhopas, remains a sacred matter, a passing down of received oral wisdom. 19 Verrier Elwin, according to Marcuse (1975b: 141), is cited for his statement that the Muria hulki mandri is equivalent to the "damru" [sic]. Adivasi communities immediately to the east of the Bhil culture zone in Madhya Pradesh, the Gondi-speaking Gonds and the Munda-speaking Korku of Hoshangabad district, from my own investigations, do not have the hourglass drum today. S.K. Jain (1965) mentions no hourglass drum for the Gonds, nor does Kaufmann (1961), Knight (1983) or Furer-Haimendorf (1948, 1979). Genevieve Dournon (1980), in her liner notes for an album of music of Gond-related tribes of Bastar, Madhya Pradesh, notes a "clay or wooden hourglass-shaped drum" played by the "Kondagaon Muria" but has no photograph or recording of it. Kondagaon is a large town, a subdistrict headquarters, and Dournon may simply have been reporting the existence of an udukkai or other South Indian hourglass drum among an urbanized adivasi population. The Baiga, a smaller community within the Gond culture zone, according to Elwin (1939: 431-58), have four drums, none of them hourglass shaped. Farther to the east, in the upper region of the Narmada Valley near Amarkantak in the Mandla district of Madhya Pradesh, Shamrao Hivale (1946: 65-6) reports on a caste he names as Dhulia who sometimes serve as musicians for the Gond. The Dhulia, from his description, play a drum that may be shaped as an hourglass. The name Dhulia may refer to a community that originated in Dhule, a heavily Bhil district of Maharashtra. In the same region, according to Hivale, the shaman/priests (ojhas) of the Gonds and Pardhans, are said to play the dhank drum, which may or may not be hourglass-shaped. R.V. Russell and R.B. Hiralal (1916: IV, 296), also give this name, dhank, to the drum which, if it is an hourglass drum, would represent its most easterly point of location. However, the drum in question may, in fact, be the large Bengali laced-headed cylinder drum, the dhakka. Further to the east, among the Santal and other Munda-language tribes, there appear to be no hourglass drums, according to Joseph Troisi (1978). Other studies of Munda and/or Santal music or musical instruments -- Hoffmann and van Emelin (1950), Babiracki (1984), Prasad (1985), Raha (1967), Satpathy (1980), P. Sinha (1970), make no mention of an hourglass drum. References Cited Agrawala, R.C. 1974 "Khajuraho of Rajasthan: the Temple of Ambika at Jagat." Arts Asiatiques 10/1:44-65.
