WAYNE PENN University of Kansas Using data mostly from American politics and comparative studies, Professor Penn argues that general systems theory "is often regarded as appropriate as the most general framework for political science. " But he feels also that we need to be far more careful and sophisticated in our use of it. Reading it in conjunc- tion with Weltman's article which follows, one is struck with the degree to which Weltman anticipates Penn's arguments. Is he right? Doubtless Penn or others will return to the attack; nor in any case can one expect a single article to kill an entire move- ment. A Ph.D. from Claremont Graduate School, A. Wayne Penn has taught at Claremont Men's College and Pomona, and subse- quently at Kansas. He is interested in developing frameworks for the analysis of political order and change, concentrating on ways of overcoming the opposition between equilibrium and dialectical frameworks.

WAYNE PENN 273 Systems theory is one of the latest in a series of "new" approaches in political science.' These began to appear in conjunction with the decline of the traditional paradigm, with its focus upon the formal institutions of government. In effect, the fall of this paradigm occasion- ed a crisis in political science which has yet to be resolved. We are still in the midst of what Gabriel Almond calls a "scientific revolution," 2 in the course of which many new approaches have arisen, each said to provide a new framework for political science.3 In most cases, the new approaches have clearly failed in this regard. They have included "par- tial theories" aimed at attacking particular deficiencies of traditional theory in the light of certain newly discovered facts, rather than the comprehensive "general theories" which their adherents aimed at.4 In most cases, these approaches have gained an important, young, and talented following; yet they have not carried the field. Over a period of time, they have been integrated with other partial approaches in a somewhat uneasy (often conflict-ridden) division of labor in the disci- pline.5 It is now argued by some that systems theory goes beyond these 'Perhaps postbehavioral approaches are beginning to emerge; however, this is not yet clear. 2Thomas Kuhn has popularized these terms-paradigm and scientific revo- lution-in his brilliant analysis of the development of scientific theory. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1962). He defines paradigms as ". . universally recognized scientific achiev- ements that for a time provide model problems and solutions to a community of practitioners," p. x. The relevance of his analysis to the behavioral revolution in political science is argued by two past presidents of the A.P.S.A.: David Truman, "Disillusion and Regeneration: The Quest for a Discipline," American Political Science Review, LIX (1965), pp. 865-873; Gabriel Almond, "Political Theory and Political Science," Contemporary Political Science, ed. by Ithiel de Sola Pool (New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1967). 3 See Oran R. Young, Systems of Political Analysis (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice- Hall, Inc., 1968), pp. 93-106. He assumes the competitive character of these approaches in arguing that their proponents should see them as complementing each other. 4Kuhn, op. cit., pp. 82-83. He describes the divergent nature of partial solutions to a crisis-evoking problem. David Easton has discussed this problem quite extensively. See: The Political System (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1953), pp. 52-59; and A Systems Analysis of Political Life (New York: John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1965), pp. 6-8, 474-477. 5 Consider, for example, the history of group theory as it has been incorporated into the discipline. Compare the early view of Arthur F. Bentley and those of Earl Latham at the height of the theory's popularity with the assessment of more recent commentators such as Harmon Zeigler. Arthur F.

The general systems model provides a set of abstract concepts which may be used to delineate the theoretical boundaries of any empirical subject matter and to describe its inter- related activity patterns as it evolves within an environment.9 The model is highly abstract in its general statement and extremely flexible in that its conceptual elements may be arranged in many ways to fit the contours of the various subject matters to which it is applied. 10 Its flexibility is such that at a lower level of generality, when substantive elements have been added to it, the model takes on many quite diverse forms. Thus, in the realm of empirical studies it becomes meaningless to refer to the system model; for, in fact, there are many different models. Only on the most abstract level does any singular systems model emerge. I will reserve the term general systems model for that level of analysis. In this paper, I shall explore some typical kinds of systems models found in the literature of political science. I shall argue, with special 6 Easton, A Systems Analysis, pp. 9-13. 7Systems theory and functionalism are not wholly synonymous; yet their convergence is so broad and basic in many areas that for some reasons they may be treated as one. Easton refers to systems theory as a form of functionalism, while Oran Young believes structural-functional analysis to be a derivative of systems theory. See Jerome Stephans, "The Logic of Functional and Systems Analysis in Political Science," Midwest Journal of Political Science, XIII (1969), pp. 367-394, and Young, op. cit., Chapter III. Even conflict theory can be developed in functional terms within a systemic framework; see Chalmers John- son, Revolutionary Change (Boston: Little, Brown, and Co., 1966), Chapters 2 and 3, pp. 15-58. SThis is attested by Eugene J. Meehan, Contemporary Political Thought: A Critical Study (Homewood, Illinois: Dorsey Press, 1967), p. 111. Two classic outlines of systems theory are: James G. Miller, "Toward a General Theory for the Behavioral Sciences," The American Psychologist, X (1955), pp. 513-531; and Kenneth E. Boulding, "General Systems Theory-The Skeleton of a Science," Management Science, II (1956), pp. 197-208. 9Throughout the paper, I shall use the term "model" as it is used by Abraham Kaplan. He writes, "Broadly we may say that any system A is a model of system B if the study of A is useful for the understanding of B without any direct or indirect causal connection between A and B ... The resemblance is in terms of the pattern or order exhibited in each system...." The Conduct of Inquiry (San Francisco: Chandler Publishing Company, 1964), p. 263. 10 Boulding, op. cit., pp. 197-198.</page><page sequence="4">A. WAYNE PENN 275 emphasis upon the study of national politics, that no one systems model is adequate for the study of politics on a particular level, much less for the discipline as a whole. Thus, I shall urge greater flexibility in the use of systems models, with the recognition that various systems models will bring out differing aspects of a particular subject. l In particular, I shall attempt to show that the cybernetic model, generally adopted in the study of national politics, has some serious deficiencies. It overly stresses the importance of central political processes, to the neglect of competing, decentralized power centers. Because of its con- stricted focus, many important political events occur outside its bound- aries. 12 This deficiency is met by systems models developed in the study of international integration. These models include many decen- tralized political processes excluded from the cybernetic model; for the boundaries of the political system have been expanded in these models through a redefinition of what is political. I shall document the need for this more inclusive approach on the national level by drawing upon evidence of political fragmentation in national politics. The development of this position will involve a substantial departure from generally popular systems approaches to the study of national politics. The boundaries of the political system will be somewhat altered, and a competing systemic definition of politics will be sug- gested, if not fully developed. From a systemic perspective, this shift may not seem necessary. Yet, without such a shift, much of the data from lower level empirical studies cannot be incorporated in a systemic framework; for the data does not fit within the constricted focus of the cybernetic model. Many have implicitly recognized this in their analyses of particular political systems. In effect, they have included decentral- ized and fragmented political processes by simply moving outside the restrictions of their explicitly developed cybernetic models. The sys- tems models suggested in this paper make this unnecessary, because they broaden the scope of the political system without losing its central focus. Thus they represent a needed step toward integrating systems theory on a national level with diverse patterns of empirical research conducted in lower level studies. A brief discussion of general systems " Cf. Young, op. cit., p. 12. 12 Jon Heggan tells me, for example, that most studies of politics in Peru have focused primarily upon national politics in the capital city, Lima, neglecting partially autonomous power centers in the provinces. Thus, when a group of generals led by Velasco engineered a successful coup d'etat, most experts were at a loss to explain their political bases of power outside the army. It would seem that much of their support comes from provincial power centers which these studies have largely ignored.</page><page sequence="5">276 NEW GENERATION OF SYSTEMS MODELS theory and derivative models will establish a setting in which these various political systems models can be examined. I. The Development of Systems Models As in the case of most important social concepts, "system" is used in many different ways. Perhaps the simplest definition is provided by the biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy, who defines a system as a set "of elements standing in interaction." 13 Beginning from a starting point similar to this, general systems theorists develop a series of proposi- tions. It is usually assumed that the parts of a system form an inter- dependent whole, so that changes in one part bring about changes in the others. Thus, the parts are associated in functional relationships among themselves and with the system as a whole. As an obvious and often used example in reference to organic systems puts it, the healthy heart contributes to the operation of the other parts of the body and to the operation of the body as a whole, while a defective heart will have detrimental effects which ramify throughout the system. Further, the system interacts with an environment. Within some range of environ- mental conditions, the system can adapt to changing situations in its normal operation (that is, with the retention of its main structural elements), while outside that range are conditions which would force its radical alteration or destruction. Within a fairly static environment, a system may persist with little adaptive capacity. Still, the adaptive capacity of the system will determine the range of conditions in which it can survive. Over time, of course, its adaptive capacity may change, if the system has morphogenic capacity. 14 The general systems theorist is particularly interested in knowing what system processes maintain the stability of the system in the midst of a changing environment. What maintains the stability of the atom? How does the body maintain a constant temperature in an environment with changing temperatures? Likewise, what factors favor the survival of an international organization in a changing environment? On the other hand, the theorist wishes to understand systemic processes of change-those changes which involve basic structural changes in the 13 Ludwig von Bertalanffy, "General Systems Theory," General Systems Year- book, I (1956), p. 3. See also: Young, op. cit., pp. 13-26; and Walter Buckley, Sociology and Modern Systems Theory (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, Inc. 1967), pp. 41-80. 14 Buckley, op. cit., pp. 58-66. Buckley presents a good case for the use of morphogenic models; however, he does not suggest how they should be construc- ted in any detailed manner.</page><page sequence="6">A. WAYNE PENN 277 system. 15 Some of these processes adapt the system to changing conditions by modifying and perhaps amplifying internal structures of the system. For example, some fundamental changes are required in a political system as a society modernizes. Other processes of change, however, are quite disruptive and may bring system breakdown or transition. By focusing upon the whole of a system, a theorist can relate particular and limited processes to the ongoing state of this system as a totality-for example, the rise of a new super power in the international system may change the general complexion of the system. An obvious and important distinction is generally recognized be- tween a natural system, that is, one existing "out there" in nature, and an empirically oriented theoretical system, constructed by the theorist to help him interpret what is "out there." Controversy does arise, however, in regard to how far the researcher must go toward establish- ing the existence and contours of a natural system before he may legitimately construct a theoretical system model to interpret the subject matter. While there may be little dispute over conceiving the human body in system terms, a systemic approach to the study of international relations may provoke the argument that no international system in fact exists. To what extent, for example, do all nation states stand in interaction with each other over a particular period of time to be studied? Thus, the social scientist may have genuine difficulty establishing the existence of the natural system which he describes in theory. 16 David Easton meets this problem in two ways, both of which involve a "constructivist" approach to theory building. On the one hand, he suggests, "Any set of elements selected for description and explanation may be considered a system of behavior." 17 What is important is only that the theoretical system is "interesting," in the sense that it helps in the understanding of a theoretical problem. 18 On the other hand, he recognizes that his theoretical system will only approximate the empir- ical subject matter. 19 In other words, his theoretical system may be no 15 I avoid here any discussion of differences between changes in the system and changes of the system. See Talcott Parsons, et al. Theories of Society (New York: The Free Press, 1961), pp. 37, 70-71. 16 I also avoid a discussion of the distinction between concrete and analytic systems. While this distinction is a crucial one, it is not immediately germane to the present discussion. See Marion J. Levy, The Structure of Society (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1952), pp. 122-126. 17 David Easton, A Framework for Political Analysis (Englewood Cliffs: Pren- tice-Hall, Inc., 1965), p. 30. 18 Ibid., p. 30.

Thus, he sidesteps some rather sticky issues without abandon- ing the desire that a theoretical system be at least indirectly related to the ongoing "real world," while the exact nature of this relationship is left open. The immediate point to be drawn from this discussion is that the social scientist, in constructing a theoretical system, must necessarily focus upon selected aspects of the subject matter he means to study. In no way does he, even with a systemic frame of reference, encompass the whole of the subject within his theoretical system. In fact, the social scientist may have only limited knowledge of the true contours of his subject matter. Presumably this point should not have to be made. Beginning texts on empirical theory make this clear in regard to all theoretical constructs. 20 However, there is a tendency for political scientists to forget this and to talk of the political system as if their constructs clearly and completely described the reality under study. Further, I emphasize this point because in the following analysis I underline the need for a more flexible use of systems models in political science. Historically, social scientists have borrowed many of their models from the seemingly more successful hard sciences. 21 Such models have the advantage that they refer to concrete processes that can be studied empirically. Further, each of the models is an integral part of an advanced theoretical system which has been verified empirically. Thus, the models provide a well developed perspective which has been found useful in at least one field of science. Three of these models have been particularly influential in the development of systems theory in polit- ical science and should be alluded to briefly. They are the mechanical, the organic, and the cybernetic. 22 The mechanical model derives from Newtonian physics and from the earlier development of clockwork. It rests upon the assumption that the interaction of a set of interrelated elements can be reduced to a set of laws which govern their dynamics. When these energized elements produce mutually counterbalancing forces, a state of equilibrium is achieved. When this is not the case, their relationship will continue to 20 Cf. Abraham Kaplan, op. cit., pp. 284-288. 21 Buckley, op. cit., pp. 8-41. 22 Karl Deutsch, The Nerves of Government (New York: The Free Press, 1963), pp. 26-34, 75-97. Use of the term "mechanical" in this typology is misleading in one sense: we have machines which are homeostatic and those which are cyber- netic. As the typology is a widely recognized one, it is easier to note this fact than to change the typology.</page><page sequence="8">A. WAYNE PENN 279 change according to stable rules of motion until a new equilibrium is achieved. Thus, the state of the system can be represented at any time by a set of force vectors showing the relative balance among the various active elements. In some ways the "laissez faire" model of an economic system approximates this model, while the Newtonian model of the universe is its classic example. The classic organic model is the organism: a system of functionally inter-dependent parts which give the system the capacity to adapt to a changing environment while maintaining a basic organizational struc- ture, necessary to a somewhat prepatterned lifecycle. The organism lacks the instability of the mechanical system, in that it is homeo- static-that is, it has processes which maintain its structure in response to a changing environment. The bodily thermostat is often referred to as a good example of a homeostatic mechanism. Durkheim extensively developed an organic analogy of society in his analysis of the division of labor in society. Functional theories of society are often related to this organic analogy. The society is seen as an evolving system of social life, in which the life functions of the whole are performed by many specialized subsystems (read organs). Somewhat disillusioned with the idea of a systemic life cycle of development, maturation, etc., most functionalists have retreated to the concept of system survival. In what ways, they ask, do the parts contribute to the persistence of the system as a whole? The model differs from the mechanical in that competition among the parts is moderated by their normative (or natural) commit- ment to the system as a community (or social organism). Durkheim stressed this view of society in going beyond the "laissez faire" model of economics.23 The cybernetic model, deriving from communications engineering, portrays a self-modifying communication network which is organized in such a way that it can monitor its progress toward system goals, adjusting for errors in previous calculations. The radar controlled anti- aircraft gun is a classic example of the cybernetic system. The decisions of a central control unit come in response to the continuing informa- tion provided by the radar. The control unit accordingly sends orders repositioning the guns to follow the changing movements of the target. Successful system adaptation will attain the goal of shooting down the plane. The complex cybernetic model stresses the higher levels of organic existence in which self-consciousness, purpose, and learning capacity have become dominant. 24 The model allows the development 23 Emile Durkheim, The Division of Labor in Society (New York: The Free Press of Glencoe, 1964), pp. 226-227, 256-282. 24 Karl Deutsch. op. cit., pp. 80-82, 98-109.</page><page sequence="9">280 NEW GENERATION OF SYSTEMS MODELS of goal-oriented theory. It may be used to describe how systems typically proceed in the attempt to attain system goals, 25 or it may be used by system participants to prescribe how they should go about attaining system goals. In both forms, it has been an important addition in the theoretical arsenal of political scientists. 26 Systems models in political science typically involve combinations of perspectives derived mainly from these models. 27 There has been a tendency, however, for particular kinds of systems models to be associ- ated with particular levels of analysis. The contrast between the most widely recognized models of the international system and the differing models of national political systems is particularly instructive in this matter. II. National and International System Models: A Contrast Models of the international system usually have national actors as their basic active units. A typical international model includes system rules which predict the normal inter-actions of these actors. 28 Thus, in one sense, system norms are predominant; yet the partially autonomous status of national actors is preserved. To some degree, their capacity to mobilize coercive power is seen as the basic resource these actors bring to the system. Thus various configurations of power set the context in which system processes evolve. Offsetting power constellations both inherit and modify the rules governing their interaction. Within this interactive process, the major control mechanisms in the system are established and stabilized. Thus, control is seen as somewhat decentral- 25 In some cases with cybernetic models, it is convenient to describe systemic developments in anthropomorphic terms-for example, the system does this or does that. This practice should be understood as convenient shorthand for the description of more complicated processes of activity. It should not be construed as naive reification. 26 The obvious success of economists in controlling certain facets of the national economy has been influential. Attempts to develop comparably fruitful social indicators have been increasingly important. See: Raymond A. Bauer, ed., Social Indicators (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1966). 27 Buckley discusses a number of such models in sociology, op. cit., pp. 7-40. 28 For example, see Morton A. Kaplan, "Balance of Power, Bipolarity, and Other Models of International Systems," American Political Science Review, LI (1957), pp. 684-695. Cf. George Modelski, "Comparative International Systems," World Politics, XIV (1962), pp. 662-74. See also Oran R.

WAYNE PENN 281 ized in the international system, being the product of partial accom- modations among some number of competing power groups. 29 To an important degree the system is unit dominant: that is to say, the system lacks cybernetic control patterns which centralize dominant power in the system. If such control is exerted, it emanates from various of the units (or groups of units) themselves. 30 International systems theorists have gone beyond this approach to the analysis of international relations. They have introduced models which involve substantially greater centralized power in the system. 31 (The import of such models will be discussed below.) However, most students of international relations are still strongly influenced by the realist school of international politics, with its emphasis upon national interest and power. 32 While systems builders add system norms and emerging universal actors, they continue to stress the primary impor- tance of the national actor and the international distribution of power in their analysis of the modern period. 33 Balance of power, bi-polar, and multi-polar systems models generally reflect the different config- urations of power in the international system. Some would argue that such systems are mechanical; yet Morton Kaplan argues that stability in his models of the international system is produced by processes resembling homeostasis in the organism-that is, the units change to offset changes in the environment. In any case, international systems models revolve about equilibrating processes which stabilize the system in response to disruptive outbreaks. Kaplan, for example, records basic international changes in a diversity of system models rather than in the mechanics of change integral to his models themselves, although in- creasingly he seems interested in system transforming changes. I shall 29 Control is not, however, as decentralized as it was in the classic freemarket model in economics. The models proposed remind one somewhat of those found in oligopoly theory. See Kenneth E. Boulding, Economic Analysis (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1955). Cf. Richard N. Rosecrance, Action and Reaction in World Politics: International Systems in Perspective (Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1963), pp. 219-275. 30 This fact, of course, is seen by many to be the major deficiency of inter- national law. It should be noted that my use of the term "system dominance" differs from that of Morton Kaplan.

This is permissible, since homeostasis is actually a form of equilibrium. National political systems are typically portrayed with a different mix of system components. Centralized control mechanisms typically predominate in this form of systems theory. Various distinguishing characteristics of the political system, such as "the authoritative alloca- tion of values for a society," emphasize the cybernetic quality of political control in the systems being studied. 34 Political dominance is further emphasized in the argument that control over the legitimate use of physical force is normally monopolized by the political system. 3 By definition then, these political systems encompass the central and manifest control mechanisms of their host social systems. However, this does not suggest that the mechanisms of the political systems will fully control social change in the societies. Rather it is to say that when attempts at public control are made, organizational units in the political system are involved as the authoritative vehicles of society. Coercive power is often reduced to a background condition in this form of systems theory. Consensus and exchange among the politically active replace it. Thus, the capacity for central political control rests upon the ability of the political system to respond to at least some number of political demands in politically legitimate ways. The input- output structure of the model parallels that of models used to describe a brain or a computer control system. 36 However, only minimal goals of system persistence are assumed to be universal; so political control in the social system is not conceived to be fully dominant as would be the case in a fully computerized system. Thus, the areas in which political control dominates will vary from system to system: political control 34 This definition was created by David Easton and is rivaled in popularity only by that developed by Almond and Powell.

In all cases, the relative emergence of the political system measures the extent to which the social system has developed a central- ized and self-conscious capacity for controlled adaptation.37 This model of politics, then, emphasizes the highly morphogenic quality of more advanced social systems. 38 There are obvious differences between these examples of inter- national and national systems models. The decentralized transactional character of the international model contrasts with the cybernetic structure of the national model. Coercive power relationships among partially autonomous, often hostile, units predominate on the inter- national level. 39 On the other hand, the model of the national political system tends to subsume power relationships within a dominant politi- cal community characterized by a set of common values and authorita- tive institutions. 40 Further system adaptation through cooperative con- flict-reducing processes is stressed on the national level,41 while on the international level, systemic processes which promote stability among contending power groups are stressed. Thus in regard to relative em- phasis the international model is decentralized, force oriented, and 37 Deutsch makes this parallel quite clear in his discussion of higher level learning processes and political self-awareness. The Nerves of Government, pp. 163-213. 38 The stress upon cybernetic control finds classic expression in the manage- ment science approach to administration. More recently, the operations research model has provided refined empirical procedures for promoting controlled system adaptation in the attainment of dominant system goals. It should be noted that formal organizations make ideal subjects for such controlled developmental models. Cf. Robert Boguslaw, The New Utopias: A Study of System Design and Social Change (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1965), pp. 31-34, 49-55. 39 "Partially autonomous" signifies not a lack of interdependence, but rather a partial interdependence, which involves a limited number of dimensions of com- mon concern. Though I arrived at this formulation independently, it parallels that of Oran R. Young, A Systemic Approach to International Relations, op. cit., pp. 7-8. 40 Conflict theorists attack this form of systems analysis, which they depict as consensus theory. See Ralf Dahrendorf, Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1957), pp. 157-165. In defense of consensus theory see William Mitchell, Sociological Analysis and Politics: The Theories of Talcott Parsons (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1967), pp. 37-48. An attempt to combine the two schools of thought may be found in Chalmers Johnson, Revolutionary Change (Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1966), pp. 15-40. 41 For example, Almond and Powell, op. cit., place great emphasis upon "differentiation" and "secularization" as basic to political development, both of which are aspects of the growth of a cooperative division of labor.</page><page sequence="13">284 NEW GENERATION OF SYSTEMS MODELS equilibrating, while the national political model is centralized, coopera- tive, and morphogenic. Still, both of these models place great emphasis upon the sovereign political system. It is the most basic unit of analysis in each case, while other patterns of interaction-both formal and informal-are woven about it. In this way, these system models share much of the traditional framework of political science, although they also make more provision for including the findings of behavioral research. In each case, these models relate behavioral findings to the analysis of traditional units- sovereign governments and the political cultures which support them. The power of other political units on a lower level may be considered, but only in a subordinate capacity as these units influence the ongoing process of central policy-making in the state. No attention is given to the authoritative capacity of these lower level political units. That is to say, they are not seen as rival centers of political power which may compete for authority with the central political units of the society. 42 Thus, sovereign states are the dominant actors in both of the models under consideration. 43 This formalistic bias, with a stress upon sovereignty, is not in itself problematic. All systems models distinguish sharply between environ- mental and systemic variables. This distinction allows important bound- aries to be drawn-boundaries which delimit the scope of study in a theoretically rigorous fashion. Intrasystemic variables are viewed as if they were interdependent while external variables are seen as ranging from independent to dependent. This strategy of research encourages the discovery of systemic interrelationships which otherwise might be easily ignored. The strategy is often a long-range one in the sense that it stresses the slow accumulation of knowledge of a great number of these systemic inter-relationships. 44 Boundaries help to delimit systemic in- quiry without radically isolating the system from its environment. 42 Easton would probably argue that lower level political units are political systems for their own social systems as well as subordinate parts of the national systems model. Certainly this is true; however, it does not meet the objection that rival centers of power are excluded from the cybernetic model. 43 I recognize that Easton's model applied to the international system would present a very different picture which I have not chosen to investigate. It is not that these theorists are wedded to the concept of sovereignty, but rather that their systems when applied on these respective levels reinforce the emphasis upon the sovereign state, however much they wish to avoid this. 44 Parsons' early article, while characteristically difficult, is still the best dis- cussion of the subject.

This strategy then creates a broad but bounded research focus without wrenching the subject matter from its natural environment. Thus, to argue that systems theory is defective because it establishes a specific range of system variables and limits the consideration of environmental variables is to ignore the strategic goals of the approach: for these limitations are integral to its success. Still, the scope given a system must be related to the questions being asked of it. If one wishes to investigate the nature of the family system in a culture with extended kinship ties, then to study only the nuclear family system could be misleading. If one wishes to know "who gets what, when, how," then it may be a mistake to limit political study on any level to those actions oriented toward "the authoritative allocation of values" for that social unit as a whole. 45 By doing so one restricts the political to those instances when a social consensus (among the politically active) has defined the system of legitimate authority. In the absence of social consensus, no politics exists from this point of view. Yet, so much political conflict, as normally defined, takes place in the absence of agreed upon authority. Certainly this is the case in international politics. In like manner, however, it may be misleading, on the international level, to emphasize such a limited set of formally defined actors as national actors. In both instances, units at one level of analysis have been made the central actors of the system, leading on the international level to a decentral- ized equilibrium model and on the national to a cybernetic model. Further, both models have focused centrally upon the cybernetic capac- ity of the national actor alone. If a broader set of power centers were to be included in either model, this cybernetic capacity of the nation-state would be compromised by the inclusion of rival power centers at other levels of analysis. To compromise the cybernetic character of the national political 45 Here, of course, I have juxtaposed Lasswell's early definition of the subject matter for political science against Easton's definition of the political system. Harold D. Lasswell, Politics: Who Gets What, When, How (New York: McGraw- Hill Book Company, 1936). Easton, op. cit., p. 50. Lasswell's definition stresses the distribution of social power throughout the society, while Easton's focuses more upon the politically authoritative institutions of the society. Easton's analysis leads toward determining how and why these institutions persist. Lass- well's, on the other hand leads toward determining the relative position of authoritative political institutions within the overall mix of social power struc- tures.</page><page sequence="15">286 NEW GENERATION OF SYSTEMS MODELS system model by including such rival power centers is to set aside the usual distinction between mechanical (or low level organic) and cyber- netic models. Where numerous decentralized processes are included, emphasis is generally placed upon the equilibrating processes of the system. Change is not excluded, but it is external to the central processes of system control and is introduced in a random fashion by lower level units or forces external to the system. While the equilibrium may be dynamic, the fundamental analytic emphasis is upon system stability. On the other hand, central actors of the cybernetic system commit that system to processes of controlled change. Thus, the cybernetic system model is appropriate for more advanced systems which have developed a sophisticated capacity for self-directed change, while the equilibrium of the mechanical model applies in the case of more primitive systems which lack a pronounced capacity for change. For this reason, centralized and decentralized systems models do not seem to mix well. Consequently, as political scientists have moved from static to dynamic models of national political systems (with the stress upon political development), they have generally moved toward the cybernetic model of the political system. With the current emphasis upon political modernization, the cybernetic model seems well en- trenched. The immediate question then becomes, "Does a develop- mental approach to politics demand a cybernetic model?" The answer to this question will depend upon what models are appropriate for the analysis of systemic change. The striking fact, upon reflection, is that the capacity of a system for change is not directly related to the degree of centralized control in the system. In fact, some system theorists have made a quite different argument. They suggest that centralization of control makes for greater capacity to change in a limited number of ways consistent with the dominant mode of systemic organization. 46 On the other hand, how- ever, the greatest capacity for numerous modes or patterns of systemic transformation is associated with a loosely organized system which has numerous partially independent points of change; for such a system is not constrained by a singular and predominant organization. 47 Buckley goes so far as to argue that the adaptability of a species suggests the most highly developed model of systemic flexibility-a model in which numerous semiautonomous control centers make a great number of uncoordinated changes, the effects of which only slowly and selectively 46 Karl Deutsch, The Nerves of Government, pp. 165-166. 47 Ibid.</page><page sequence="16">A. WAYNE PENN 287 ramify throughout the system.48 Models of decentralized control, then, are not necessarily less morphogenic than models of centrally con- trolled change. Perhaps different kinds of change are more clearly described by one or the other of the models. With this in mind, it is possible to classify the above set of political system models in a somewhat different fashion. Suppose the main emphasis were placed upon the structure of control (or power) centers found on the system-wide level.49 One might ask, "What configuration of control centers move the system in the last analysis? Does this configuration have a central tendency provided by a dominant control center, or are the patterns of control sufficiently autonomous of each other that patterns of change caused by particular power centers are only indirectly related to those caused by others, although the system as a whole is altered by change of both sets?" In a simple dichotomous typology, I would describe the first pattern as tending toward a mono- centric system model, while the second tends toward a polycentric model. Either of these models could take many configurations in the other regards; however, they record basically different patterns of system control (see Figure I for diagrams of these models). Most national systems models are monocentric. While they include a wide variation in the level of system control over contextual variables as well as in the specificity of system goals, these models mainly focus upon a central systemic capacity to react to and to mold an environ- ment. 50 In contrast, the international systems model described above is certainly polycentric. Yet, international systems models are increasingly morphogenic: for changes of the international system are recognized to be as dramatic as those of its unit parts, which are of course conceived 48 Walter Buckley, Sociology and Modern Systems Theory, p. 16. 49 I particularly emphasize the systemic level here. Only those power centers whose activities may create major structural changes of the system are of interest here. Thus, while the system may include all manner of lower level power configurations, which influence these systemic power centers, they are only indirectly related to those activities which may move the system. For this reason, they are not included in this discussion. 50 While Almond and Powell explicitly deny that their systems approach applies a cybernetic model to politics, their analysis is generally monocentric. They are concerned with the political system, with systemic "conversion functions" which aggregate articulated interests, and produce outputs which may be described in terms of system capabilities. Thus, their system is framed in a manner generally consistent with the cybernetic model. When they depart from the cybernetic approach, they primarily rely upon ideas from the traditional paradigm. Further, they envision a convergence with cybernetic theory in the future.

Stu- dents of international integration have begun to develop models which, in fact, do this. 3 I shall describe developments in this area before considering whether or not they apply on a national level. III. Political Integration and the Bimodal System Model: A Synthesis Students of international cooperation have recently focused upon movements toward political integration among particular groups of nations. 54 Like the earlier functionalists and students of federalism, they are interested in developments which move groups of legally independent states toward the formation of a common political com- munity. Some, such as Karl Deutsch, have focused upon examples of limited cooperation, as in the creation of international defense com- munities. 55 Others, such as Ernst Haas and Amitai Etzioni, have been concerned with broader developments toward political unification. 56 51 Kaplan presents a series of static models which depict various conceived states of the international system. Singer chides him for not seeing these models as differing states of one morphogenic model. Kaplan, op. cit.; J. David Singer, "The Global System and Its Subsystems: A Developmental View" in Linkage Politics, ed., by James Rosenau (New York: The Free Press, 1969), pp. 30-31. Increasingly international systems theorists are moving in Singer's direction. 52 Charles A. McClelland, Theory and the International System (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1966), Chapter 2 "Transformations of International Systems," pp. 33-60. 53 So also have students of organization in their shift from management oriented works to those concerned with complex organizations viewed as systems. See James D. Thompson, Organizations in Action (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1967). 54 See Earnst Haas, Beyond the Nation State: Functionalism and International Organization (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1964).

In the course of their analyses, they have created an amalgam of the two types of models. In some ways, their models are polycentric, in recognition of the continuing autonomy of the participating states. Yet, the growth of organizations with some degree of system-wide authority suggests the monocentric model of the national political system. Still, this model cannot be adopted wholesale; for the participating nation-states are not mere interest groups vying for political favor. They retain broad areas of independent prerogative. Thus, the models of politics created by these political scientists are combinations of the mono- and polycentric models. The models created may be called "bimodal" in the sense that some political processes are treated in a monocentric system model and others in a polycentric model. Diagramatically, bimodal system models could be presented in many ways. For one version of a bimodal system model see Figure II. Certainly the structure of analysis is complicated by this approach, yet probably not unnecessarily so. The European Coal and Steel community should be treated with a monocentric model for some purposes: it has political authority to make policy decisions in some very important areas. In many other areas of political policy, the participating nation states should be seen as independent centers of political power. For example, in the development of a nuclear strike force, France acted alone. No adequate representation of Western European politics can ignore this divergence beween system-actor-con- trolled and unit-controlled policy areas. The bimodal design of these models creates a perspective which encourages some particularly interesting questions. To what degree has policy-making power been centralized, or conversely, what policy areas remain decentralized? Are certain modes of organization more con- ducive to stability than others? Is there a "spillover" effect from areas centrally coordinated into others? Which processes lead toward greater unit autonomy? What kinds of units are most likely to move toward unification and why? What arguments are there in favor of continued unit autonomy? 57 Unlike the interest groups in national systems models, these units are recognized to be capable of independent po- litical action. This recognition in turn shifts the perspective of the observer and opens up a range of questions otherwise ignored. Models of this sort are especially provocative in their combination of central and unit control centers. All of these patterns of control are included within a partially integrated regional system by means of some variant of the bimodal system model. 57 Questions of this kind are contained in Haas, Deutsch, and Etzioni.</page><page sequence="20">A.

It should be recognized that the number of satellites could be multiplied indefinitely in the creation of polymodal systems models. David Rosenbloom deserves credit for this representa- tion of the bimodal system.</page><page sequence="21">292 NEW GENERATION OF SYSTEMS MODELS These theorists include various levels and aspects of political integra- tion in their models. Haas, for example, analyzes the degree of integra- tion within Western Europe, focusing particularly upon the emergence of supranational organization. 8 Basically he is concerned with the extent to which monocentric processes emerge from within a poly- centric context. He is concerned with those areas of social policy-mak- ing in which supranational organization has become important; the degree to which its decision-making processes are independent from national control; the sanctions it can bring to bear on those who defy its mandates. With probes of this sort, he is able to explore the relative balance of monocentric and polycentric processes.59 His approach stresses the importance of emerging supranational political structures in the process of regional integration. While earlier functional theorists assumed that growing economic interdependence among nations would automatically lead toward political unification, Haas has emphasized the need for monocentric political structures to spur the process of integration. 60 Etzioni, on the other hand, distinguishes three aspects of political integration in social systems. His argument suggests that political organ- ization may be characterized by the fact that it: has some degree of control over the use of the means of violence; is a center of decision- making that is able to significantly affect the allocation of resources and rewards throughout a system; and is a "focus of political identifi- cation" for a large group of politically aware citizens.61 Political scientists have long stressed the importance of control over violence and political identification, although they have usually assumed that both of these pertain exclusively to one political unit within a territorial area. By regarding these as variables which may pertain to more than one political unit within a territorial area, researchers can encompass a greater variety of political situations. Further, new measures of political identification, deriving from survey research and content analysis, lend it increasing precision as a concept. 62 Likewise the allocation of re- 58 Haas, op. cit., pp. 20, 36-37. 59 Ibid. 60 Ibid.

Recently William and Joyce Mitchell, among others, have added important empirical substance to this focus. 63 In each of these three areas it has been possible to develop empirical indicators which describe the mix of political units in a social system. It is understood, for example, that a high degree of integration in one area does not preclude low integration in another. 64 Moreover, Etzioni complements these static categories with an analysis of the dynamic processes of unification and de-unification. 65 He, along with these other students of international regionalism, has gone a long way toward developing con- cepts and empirical indicators for bimodal system models. 66 IV. A Bimodal Approach to National Politics? That such a model has utility on the international level has been amply demonstrated by these theorists and others. It breaks into the unit dominance presumed by the polycentric model and allows the analysis of supranational organization without moving wholly to a monocentric focus. Whether this model would be useful on the national level is not so immediately obvious. The monocentric system model has been used almost exclusively by those applying systems theory on a national level. This fact relates to the nature of the shift toward dynamic analysis described above, but it also relates to the continuing theoretical dichotomy between the state and civil society so dominant in the traditional paradigm. This dichotomy emphasizes the exclusive nature of sovereignty and the limitation of politics on a national level to those activities affecting the exercise of sovereign power.67 In addition, however, functional theories of the social system have lent further support to this monocentric model of national politics. 63 See particularly Joyce M. and William C. Mitchell, Public Policy Making and Political Science (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1969). 64 Etzioni, op. cit., pp. 7-11. 65 Ibid., pp. 51-63, 80-88. 66 It should be noted that similar system models have been developed in the study of metropolitan politics. Cf. Scott Greer, The Emerging City (New York: The Free Press, 1962) Philip E. Jacob and James V. Toscano, eds., The In- tegration of Political Communities (Philadelphia and New York: J. B. Lippincott Company, 1964). 67 Max Weber's classic definition of the state suggests this approach, since it emphasizes the capacity to maintain ". . . the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force...." in the enforcement of a social order. The Theory of Social and Economic Organization ed., by Talcott Parsons (New York: The Free Press, 1964), p. 154.</page><page sequence="23">294 NEW GENERATION OF SYSTEMS MODELS The structural-functionalists have been active systems builders in sociology and anthropology. Among their leading theorists, the social system has been viewed organically as a highly interdependent set of activities, which, through a complex division of labor, contributes to the maintenance of a harmonious and stable system in the face of continuing conflict and change. 68 Major social structures contribute in various ways to the system as a whole. One of the major tasks of the theorist is to determine what systemic functions are performed by particular structures. From a complementary perspective, the theorists may first determine what functions are essential to the survival of the system and then go on to discover what structures perform these functions. It is by this latter approach that the theorist describes a subsystem as all those structures which perform a particular crucial function. Thus Parsons describes the polity as the subsystem which is mainly concerned with "goal attainment" for society, that is, socially coordinated efforts toward societal problem solving. His model of society is highly integrated, in the sense that all major subsystems perform their particular vital roles. 69 Thus, the polity must be seen as essentially monocentric vis-a-vis society, although society itself is poly- centric as a system. 70 Without such a highly integrated model of society, the political system could be viewed differently; however, Parsons supports the view that the nation-state is the predominant level of social organization and should be modeled as a highly integrated system. For whatever reasons, no equivalent of the bimodal systems model has been recognized as appropriate on the national political level. National political systems are almost always cast in a monocentric model. Yet, what societies are so well integrated that there is a clearly defined and operationally coherent political system-in which authori- 68 As is often noted, one of Parsons' fundamental question is, "How is order possible in a world of conflict?" This is a starting point similar to that of Thomas Hobbes. See William Mitchell, Sociological Atralysis Politics: The Theories of Talcott Parsons (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, Inc., 1967), pp. 9-11. 69 Dennis Wrong argues that Parsons' model presents an "over-socialized" view of man. "The Functional Theory of Stratification," American Sociological Re- view, XXIX (1964), pp. 772-782. Parsons' model also presents an over-integrated view of society. 70 It is ironic that sociologists with their highly complex models of the social system have imparted a monocentric model of politics to the political scientists. See, for example, Talcott Parsons, Societies: Evolutionary and Comparative Perspectives, (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1966), and Amitai Etzioni, The Active Society: A Theory of Societal and Political Processes (New York: The Free Press, 1968).</page><page sequence="24">A. WAYNE PENN 295 tative societal action is clearly distinguished from that which is not, in which political power is so clearly delineated that the political system in fact guides society in a cybernetic fashion? No actual political system, to my knowledge, meets these criteria, though perhaps some specific political processes approach such a standard. Yet, if the po- litical scientist were to focus only upon these processes, he would radically diminish the scope of political science. Politics on any level involves a complex mix of processes some rationalized and centralized, others contradictory and lacking any central coherence. As E. E. Schattschneider argues, politics seems to involve contradictory strains toward the public and the private. 71 In addition, that which is public is broken into numerous power centers some of which are substantially independent or autonomous from central control. A bimodal (or per- haps polymodal) model can reflect this complexity more adequately than a monocentric model, which portrays conflict within the system as basically controlled by the cybernetic processes of the system. Numer- ous studies suggest the need to add polycentric patterns to the mono- centric model of national politics. Discussion of a few of these will help to clarify my position. Analysis of specific administrative policy areas in national politics occasionally leads to the recognition that they vary quite extensively in regard to the set of actors involved, the location of the arena of action, and the degree of arena autonomy from central control. Grant McConnell argues that American political power is highly fragmented, that the political system is characterized by numerous decentralized administrative power centers, often captured and controlled by private clientele groups with which they interact. 72 Central political control is virtually nonexistent in numerous areas of public policy for much of the time. A colleague of McConnell's, Theodore Lowi, extends this analysis to hypothesize that there are various kinds of policy-making arenas with varying degrees of central control typically associated with them. 73 Indeed, some processes approximate the cybernetic model of 71 E. E. Schattschneider, The Semi-Sovereign People: A Realist View of Democ- racy in America (New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1960). 72 Grant McConnell, Private Power and American Democracy (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1966), pp. 336-352.

Such decentralized and contradictory processes are better han- dled in a polycentric model. In a monocentric model, the theorist would portray these political arenas as subsystems which emerge as the political system develops greater differentiation of functions. From a polycentric perspective, the theorist would also recognize the "segmentation" of power-the emergence of semiautonomous power centers with some capacity to allocate values independently of, and even in opposition to, central leadership. 74 He would argue that they may link up with important private power centers, whose interest often conflict with those which dominate the central political system. Fred Riggs argues impressively that most developing countries lack a well integrated national political culture. Hence, nationalizing elites have only partial support throughout their societies or even within their governments. 75 Numerous local, regional ethnic, or functional elites have historically controlled their traditional societies. To the degree that central governments existed in the past, they entered into elabo- rate accommodations with these special elites, even allowing them to capture portions of the governmental bureaucracies. Thus, modernizing elites which attempt to centralize and extend governmental power find themselves in a struggle with rival political elites who control competing power centers. Riggs relates these competing elites to the existence of diverse communities within one legal state; hence, he calls this frag- mentation of political power "polycommunalism." 76 In many in- stances, the cybernetic qualities of a central power center are quite weak in the face of such powerful competition. Instead of a mono- centric political system, there are a series of partially interpenetrating, partially autonomous power systems, one of which has to some degree 74 Talcott Parsons makes this important distinction between "differentiation" and "segmentation." Differentiation involves the division of labor, in which different units perform complementary functions. On the other hand, with segmentation different units perform the same functions for their respective members from different somewhat autonomous organizational bases. The im- portance of segmentation in political systems is largely unexplored from a systemic frame of reference, except in the case of political parties.

WAYNE PENN 297 emerged as a central power system. 77 The legal governmental structure may extend across a number of these power systems, so that as various political elites conflict with each other, various parts of the government work at cross-purposes with each other. The usefulness of a bimodal approach is quite evident in the case of many such developing countries. Recently international systems theorists have been attempting to trace links between the international system and the internal politics of the national systems which are its units. 78 So long as nation-states were treated as singular actors, this was not necessary. Foreign policies of the national governments could serve as the input from the units to the international system. Thus, while on the national level the theorist could analyze the decision-making process out of which foreign policy is created, on the international level the theorist would deal only with the policy outputs of the national systems. Increasingly, however, international theorists have recognized the polycentric character of the individual states. In order to attain more precision of analysis, it has become necessary to recognize the existence of numerous semi- autonomous, intranational power centers which are not fully under the control of formal governmental leaders. J. David Singer expresses the emerging point of view: 79 If we think of nations as very complex and often unstable social coalitions, in which the formal leadership may not always exercise effective control over the coalition members, it becomes reason- able to expect that a fair amount of world political interaction will take place directly between and among intranational associations other than formal ministries, or any official agencies at all for that matter. He argues that this proposition is as true for modern nations as for developing systems. Numerous, semiautonomous power centers coexist with official organs of foreign policy and develop foreign policies of their own. Thus, the international system theorist should include intra- national as well as national units in his system. With this shift, he has eliminated the concept of full unit sovereignty without undercutting the importance of the nation-state in his model. 7 Note the similarity of Riggs' "polycommunalism" and Oran Young's "d- iscontinuities model" of the international system. In both, various subsystems only partially interpenetrate each other, and no one subsystem is clearly domi- nant. Young, op. cit. 78 James N. Rosenau, ed., Linkage Politics: Essays on the Convergence of National and International Systems (New York: The Free Press, 1969). 79 J.

The model includes a cybernetic political process in the system under study with- out according it primacy. Likewise, it recognizes diverse semi- autonomous power centers without becoming simply a decentralized equilibrium model. Thus it can accurately reflect the partially in- tegrated character of most political systems. In the final analysis, however, my argument is not that this model should be the system approach on the national level. I reiterate the point made above that our theoretical systems are highly simplified representations of a much more complicated reality. Our interests in political science are suffi- ciently diverse that no one systems model will highlight all the dimen- sions we wish to analyze. An analysis of revolution, for example, might pose the conflict between the regime and the revolutionaries in a bicentric model. 80 Or this bicentric model might be combined with a polycentric model which focuses upon lower level but partially auto- nomous power centers in the system. On top of these levels of analysis might be grafted a level indicating the influence of intervening great powers. 81 These great powers could be included within the system of analysis, or their relevant actions could be handled as inputs. In any case, many different system models could conceivably apply in the analysis of revolutionary change. V. Summary and Conclusion In summary, then, the general systems approach has been shown to 80 This is what Andrew C. Janos has done in his description of revolutionary change: "Authority and Violence: The Political Framework of Internal War" in Internal War, ed., by Harry Eckstein (New York: The Free Press, 1964), pp. 130-141. This view contrasts with the analysis of Chalmers Johnson, who posits a "power deflation" in society prior to the spread of revolutionary influence. He does not discuss the possibility that revolutionary organization could flourish in one portion of a society while a developing regime was securely settled in another. Janos does a better job of theorizing about the territorially based civil war: for example as in the United States or Nigeria. Johnson, Revolutionary Change, pp. 27-33. "' This "levels of analysis" approach has been important in the study of international subsystems; however, the clash between the super powers is usually seen as the dominant systemic pattern with other unit relationships conceived as subsystem patterns. The bimodal model would not necessarily give predominance to either.

WAYNE PENN 299 have great flexibility in the different forms it may take. The mechani- cal, organic, and cybernetic models were shown as typical examples of systems model building. It was argued that they have often been seen as varying on a continuum from static to morphogenic, with the distinc- tion between equilibrium and cybernetic control expressing the alterna- tive poles and with homeostasis somewhere between. It was suggested that those using systems models in political science have generally held decentralized equilibrium models apart from centralized cybernetic models. International and national systems models were shown as respective examples. In pursuing this issue, I showed that system morphogenesis is not epitomized in the cybernetic model, and proceeded to demonstrate how models of international integration combine central with partially autonomous control processes,-thus combining monocentric and poly- centric processes in a bimodal system model. Considering the relative fragmentation of political power in national political systems, I argued the usefulness of such a model on this level. In conclusion, what can be said about systems theory as a prospec- tive paradigm for political science? Very little of a definitive nature. This article has not assessed the adequacy of general systems theory as a comprehensive theoretical framework for political science. 82 It has, however, suggested that no one substantive systems model is implied by the existence of such a comprehensive paradigm. No one internally structured model will adequately encompass the complexities of po- litical life, nor can it even serve as a comprehensive net to catch the myriad of lower level findings. For different patterns of political power seem best approximated by divergent models. Only by defining politics as a limited dimension of social activities viewed on the most abstract level might all models reduce to one general systems model. But unless this general systems model avoids the delineation of internal system structure, it will restrict politics to a realm more limited in some ways than that which political scientists have traditionally accepted as their subject matter. Easton's cybernetic model is a good example of a model with too much internal structure to attain the level of a general systems model for political science. In it, for example, the interaction of independent rival power centers is at most peripheral, although, for many political scientists, such conflict is central to the study of politics. 82 It should be noted that some highly negative critiques have been published recently. See A. James Gregor, "Political Science and the Uses of Functional Analysis," American Political Science Review, LXII (1968), pp. 425-439. Jerome Stephens, "The Logic of Functional and Systems Analysis in Political Science," Midwest Journal of Political Science, XIII (1969), pp. 367-394.</page><page sequence="29">300 NEW GENERATION OF SYSTEMS MODELS It is far better to recognize the flexibility inherent in the general systems approach and to develop a set of systems models appropriate to various situations seen from differing perspectives. 83 If general systems theory is appropriate as the most general framework for political science, it will necessarily show this complex and variable character. 83 In this regard, models which have been developed in one area are often useful in others.
