<plain_text><page sequence="1">VERNON YOUNG From Ken-Speckle to a Pig in a Poke "They [the Tales] are a panorama which remains ken-speckle upon the mental retina." -Sir Richard Francis Burton, in his Essay on the Book of a Thousand Nights and a Night. THE FAIRY TALE IS A CRUCIBLE OF DELIGHT and, if you care, a vessel of instruction: it epitomizes all the powers of life which define for us the course of destiny as we prefer to imagine it, robbed of final castastrophe or anti-climax. It accompanies our earliest steps into a world we later call that of literature, in which we are introduced to a society we suspect does not exist but is likely to be more gratifying than the one we inhabit: more gratifying, more beautiful, even more cruel-but the cruelty in it is recon- ciled by the beauty and by a system of rewards and punishments we fail to question closely until we are grown and rational. Upon returning to these tales, after the age of innocence, we may have to admit that the seeming inequities are obscurely just. Among the Grimm Fairy Tales, which Pamela Travers, in her review of the Pantheon edition, 1944, called "this one book-other than the Bible-that has truly made Western man," there is a short, disquieting tale, Frau Trude. A young peasant girl, suspicious of old Frau Trude's noc- turnal visitors, no less than of the hag herself, is so indiscreet as to in- timate her suspicions. Whereupon, the witch-for so she is-changes the girl into a block of wood and throws her on the fire. Warming herself at the mounting blaze, she cackles contentedly, "That shines bright for once in a way." And the story ends: no wizard, prince or dwarf to the rescue, no retribution for the witch. For the wretched girl's fate, the sole justifica- tion is the brief opening description of her as "obstinately inquisitive." To be curious is to be damned. And how confidently will a present-day reader rush to deny that here we have a rustic miniature of the Pro- metheus or Faust legend? They open vistas, these stories, but we should not be eager to reread them as sermons in disguise (at least, I should not) if they had not the essential rudiments of the story-teller's art: a setting, a social hierarchy, an inherited rhythm in the structure of the telling, a mesmerizing repetition of motifs and an invariable object (as Padraic Colum has expressed it, "They put a thing in the center of the story") which returns the eye and the ear to an informing correlation: the golden slipper in Cinderella; the looking-glass of the Wicked Queen in Snow- White; the spindle in Briar Rose; the long hair in Rapunzel; the Juniper Tree in the tale of that name. They are not quite "timeless"; the form in which we receive them has been historically and culturally modified. At which mo- ment, it would be interesting to learn, did Frau Trude enter that chronol- ogy of tales which had been accumulating for perhaps a thousand years before the Thirty Years' War? Might it be as old as the forests of Ger- many after the Goths had moved in, before a touch of chivalry from Cel- tic romance which might have contrived saving spells for the girl, or could it have been a late-comer when, as the Age of Reason (and Calvin-</page><page sequence="2">THE HUDSON REVIEW ism) dawned, the folk and fairy tales were stricken at the source or ren- dered fanatical and, in Spengler's immortal sentence, "Witches were burned because they were proved, not because they were seen in the air o' nights"-? Setting, for my mind's eye, is indispensable; the more I compare notes, the more I realize that our mature reaction to the fairy tale-indeed, our consent to react-is wholly conditioned by our cultural experience of it. My personal associations with the fairy tale (the fable, the legend, the ad- venture story) are inseparable from a place, a teller, a ceremony in my early childhood; so much so that I can't cleanly sort one epiphany from another: the church in red-and-white, snow and Christmas carols; Bible stories told by our vicar in his own words (impeccable and without cant); visits to Battle Abbey; Robin Hood reenacted under the oaks of Sussex; Beauty and The Beast performed (by our matrons and prefects) in the Vic- arage; pantomimes in London (i.e. Ali Baba or Cinderella staged by profes- sional actorsfor children). All overlap. I am unable to distinguish, in ret- rospect, Christian ethic from Royalist noblesse oblige, Christian miracle from the Good Fairy-or Nuremberg from Bexhill-on-Sea! It took me half a lifetime to discover that there is such a town as Hameln, site of my earliest favorite story (favored because, I suppose, under the aspect of pathos, poetic justice was done and I was early a friend of the dramatic proprieties!). As soon as I could arrange it, I went there. Unwahrschein- lich!-there it was as I had dreamed it: encircled, it is true, by a modern clump, where electrical units and baking powder are manufactured; but within that circle, the Hameln of my story-book illustrations: the half- timbered houses, the belfries, the Rattenfdngerhaus, powdered with snow, as it happened. Lovely! and quite hair-raising. That year, Hameln was still in the "British Zone"; no giant-size imagination was demanded to recall the late Happenings when a piper had again presented his unpaid bill and half the population had disappeared under a mountain! ...... This, if not the only, is the ideal way to recapitulate the fairy tale on your pul- ses and if you were a Grimm child Germany and Austria are more prolific for you than England and Wales with survivals of the dark tower, the walled town and the moated grange. Of all this I find no trace in Roger Sale's book': no spectacular en- chantments, no alien milieu, present or distantly sighted (save in Kim); no castled towns, no Hallowe'en. Neither goblins nor unawakened princesses are much to Mr. Sale's liking and history is too unpalatable an affair to be long conjured as the matrix of generic legend. His title is misleading; plainly, it is the And After that turns him on, rather than the originals. By roughing in the Fairy Tale, proper, and some elegant variants of the 17th century, he appears to have been doing his duty by his publisher or his Department; he surveys the territory but chooses not to embrace it. Al- though he insists, at length and glumly, on the broken continuity whereby the child became a special object for whom animal and fairy sto- 'FAIRY TALES AND AFTER: From Snow White to E.B. White, by Roger Sale. Har- vard University Press. $11.00. 314</page><page sequence="3">VERNON YOUNG ries were written, with an adult (mainly Victorian) preconception of what constituted the child, in the long run he approves of the specialization. Why else, if, as he says, it "seemed important to concentrate on books with which [he felt] some marked imaginative sympathy," would he de- vote fully half his investigation to tales of Kenneth Grahame, Beatrix Pot- ter, L. Frank Baum, Walter R. Brooks and E. B. White? Patently, none of these was designed for adults. His inclusion of Kim seems incongruous to me (except that it includes animals and Mr. Sale favors the animal world, when thoroughly domesticated); if Kim, why not Treasure Island or Robin Hood or the Arabian Nights, none of which receives a mention? Here, Mr. Sale is no help, for he doesn't make clear how old he, or his children (who have partly determined his choice), were when they read the several sto- ries. (I must say that the reader for most of this stuff would have had to be born yesterday!) Mr. Sale fittingly approaches Kim as if it were a social novel but the other fables, in which cats are shopkeepers and frogs drive motor-cars, cannot support such an approach and his attempt to give them all the solemn English Department treatment leads him into strange and puckered moments. Mr. Sale is half aware that national distinctions account for something but his effort at defining them is very odd. Dr. Seuss, obviously a hero to him, is emblematically American not only for his "guying at monarchies" but also for "his uninquisitive sense that evil is probably nothing more than someone acting like a naughty child." One wonders what Haw- thorne or Melville might have made of such a definition. Mr. Sale sub- sequently assures us that he himself, was "a daylight reader, seeking to live in a daylight world." Very healthy, I'm sure, but it raises a problem; if he was never tempted by nor deeply feared the dark, he failed to appre- ciate those insights which can be earned only at the heart of darkness. Jean de Brunhoff, author of the Babar stories, is distinctively French, in Mr. Sale's reading of him, because he is "passive, civilized, both aware of the anthropomorphism implicit in racism and racist himself, never enjoy- ing a plot and never likely to yield to the temptations of melodrama." Much seems to be going on in that sentence, under cover, which had best be left obscure; as a description of the generic Frenchman, the terminal statement is wild, recklessly disposing of a few million nationals raised on Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, Guy de Maupassant, Prosper Merimee, Gaston Leroux, Jules Verne and Georges Simenon! A. A. Milne, whom Mr. Sale once loved but later rejected, is "an arrested child" [who] "be- lieves that if one learns how things are done, and named, and spelled, everything will turn out all right." Well, that's not a bad beginning for a coherent life in society. If Mr. Sale intended this as a profile of the Eng- lishman at large-forgive my smile-he was clumsily forgetting his pre- vious (or later, depending on whether he wrote his introduction first or last) commitment to four British writers who claim a lion's share of his book (Carroll, Grahame, Kipling and Potter). Perhaps he was avenging himself for the confession wrung from him as he ground out the lesson of "growing up" which "the snobbish Milne" had nonetheless instilled. 315</page><page sequence="4">THE HUDSON REVIEW So they went off together. But wherever they go, and whatever happens to them on the way, in that enchanted place on the top of the Forest, a little boy and his Bear will always be playing. To these, the closing sentences of The House at Pooh Corer, Mr. Sale adds: I do not think it particularly sentimental of me that I still find it hard to say these words without beginning to cry [he does not think it particu- larly sentimental!] though I am aware that my tears are for the lost boy I was who also wept over them. The lies they tell are known to be lies, and that saves everything. Pooh and Christopher Robin do not go away together and we know it. The Forest is forever closed, except to the memory, and that is not a sentimental fact. Must I remind an English teacher that a fact cannot be sentimental? Senti- mentality is an attitude. His final remark, quoted, is no kind of fact; if I may push the monomyth, The Forest is never closed, which an attentive reading of Grimm would reveal. Throughout these pages, Mr. Sale employs a bewildering diversity of tone. One is never sure how securely, in the books he examines, he is dis- playing the reasons for their appeal to a child reader, how far he is using the literature as autobiography, to what extent he is exercising his pre- rogative as a democratic literary critic for whom all material is impar- tially enfranchised. Mr. Sale finds it "unfortunately true" that for many people the justification of criticism is its elucidation "of what would oth- erwise be obscure and there is nothing obscure .... about The Tale of Peter Rabbit or The Wizard of Oz." Why is this "unfortunately true"? Because, to someone who is at that moment launched on elucidating the un-obscure, it is inescapably embarrassing? To my ear, many of Mr. Sale's critiques hover at the border of parody; often they cross the border. Pocketing the ethical content of The Wind in the Willows, he surmises: Perhaps he [Toad] is chastened at last, but the book must end lamely since a chastened Toad is of no interest; and the unchastened Toad has had too many tales told of him already. In The Sun Also Rises, He- mingway handles his outsider insider, Robert Cohn, with greater tact and never allows Cohn to occupy the center of the stage, as Grahame does .... You just can't do that! Criticism, like art, has due scale and perspective. Disparate modes of being or of expression my run parallel; they can only be merged at the price of absurdity. Mr. Sale has no greater fear of sounding absurd than he has of seeming sentimental. I should prefer not to think of his concluding essay, "Two Pigs," as conclusive in any other way, for it brings his subject to the zenith of bathos (or can bathos have only a nadir?). The most immediate instance of my discomfort is Char- lotte's Web; its hero is a pig, being fattened for slaughter without knowing 316</page><page sequence="5">VERNON YOUNG it, comforted by the farmer's daughter, Fern, and by Charlotte, a spider the size of a gumdrop who, in the event, dies before he does, leaving him lachrymose but impenitently eating. Before this juncture is an interlude when Wilbur (the pig) awaits a visit from Fern; since it is raining, he fears she will not come. Mr. Sale, goaded to sadness by Wilbur's ordeal, has this (and much more) to say. As I write this I watch my cat, staring out the window on a rainy morn- ing. Usually he goes outside and sniffs about in the yard at this time but he hates rain. Is he lonely, bored, disappointed? .... certainly if he feels something like these feelings, he does not respond to them with the same impatience or mournfulness that I would. But when I read about Wilbur's loneliness I think I don't understand my cat very clearly be- cause my patience and imagination are weak. Think what a long day it would be-"I have no real friend here in the barn, it's going to rain all morning and all afternoon and Fern won't come in such bad weather." If you were telling this to a five-year-old, I suppose this might be one way of explicating the text. I am trying to visualize Mr. Sale reading his paper to a seminar of English professors and graduate students, wiping away their tears as the Seattle rain darkens their window-panes. Where are we? Far, far, from a "ken-speckle panorama" that comprises the vengeful chafe of time, the hour-glass and the scattered bones, the thousand and one palaces in which golden-haired ephebes are immured or caliphs reign for a day, the dragons with two hundred teeth, the chil- dren of Hameln shivering into oblivion at the beck of pipes. We are in the fairyland of Suburban Renewal, with a pig-in-clover mooning over a dead teenage spider, where poetry, having lost the obscure atavisms, the consciousness of the malevolent, the shadow and the alchemy, can only become poesy or a bucolic anecdote. Mr. Sale will find on page 453 of Daryl Hines's The Poetry Anthology, 1912-1977, a happily recovered poem by Robert Siegel entitled "Ego." Mr. Siegel's purpose may not have been identical with that of a children's-story writer, but his vignette is a vital challenge. Here is some of it: Has thrust his nose under every board, smelt out every wild carrot and white grub .... chuffs down the white meal raising a cloud around his ears, and cleans each cob with the nicety of a Pharisee tooth for tooth, squeezing contentedly his small bagpipe voice as he mashes corn with a slobbery leer and leaves turds like cannonballs across a battlefield. Meanwhile his little pink eye is periscoped on the main chance- 317</page><page sequence="6">THE HUDSON REVIEW the gate ajar, the slipped board, the stray duck that flusters through the wire- saliva hanging from his mouth like a crown jewel. That is a pig! Exactly as Ted Hughes's otter is an otter and his thrush a thrush, undreamed of by Kenneth Grahame or E. B. White. Mr. Sale has missed the most fruitful vein of the fairy-tale and beast-fable heritage; it is in the poetry of our time. I think of Jarrell's terrifying Marchen poems, and Howard Moss as mouthpiece for King Midas, or Daryl Hine for Blue- beard's wife; Gene Baro's whimsical defence (in "Lament For Better and Worse") of Medusa with insomnia, of princesses who "perhaps are shriek- ing and not shrinking," of an ogre with an ulcer; of Sylvia Plath's under- leaf and unnerving world of mushrooms and moles; of the scathing, mar- vellous Fairy Tales of Anne Sexton. I don't know what the anxious anatomists are exposing these days as they fumble Anne Sexton's tripes but when the disinterments are completed I hope someone recognizes that her fairy tales, as poems, are not only food for speculation on the sources of her angst but also are among the best she ever wrote, tough-minded and musical. And then there is James Thurber. I might chafe yet remain tolerant at the omission of anybody else from a treatise on the fairy tale; to exclude Thurber, the winning fabulist of our day, I would name an act of treason. Mr. Sale refers to him once, passingly; for reasons that required an ex- planation, he never gets back to him. On grounds of pedagogy alone- since Mr. Sale seems very exercised about the constructive content of tales for children-he could have credited The Wonderful 0 with being the most inventive and painless vocabulary builder in the world of didactic works for the kiddies. Not primarily concerned with the instructive aspect of these fables, my exemplary Thurber fairy tale is The Thirteen Clocks. This small masterpiece of respectful travesty honors the whole spectrum of the traditions: the castle where the dark Duke has killed Time, the fair princess and her princely suitor, the triad-form of contest and reward- these are European at root; the sudden rhyming within the prose line, which was an Arabian contribution; the pseudo-Elizabethan or just Thurberian argot-"I'll slit him from his guggle to his zatch!"; the syntax that mates with itself, as in Lewis Carroll-"He called himself Xingu, which was not his name, and dangerous, since the name began with X- and still does." There remains the prose text, incomparably euphuistic, as it should be. It was cold on Hagga's hill, and fresh with furrows where the dragging points of stars had plowed the fields. A peasant in a purple smock stalked the smoking furrows, sowing seeds. There was a smell, the Go- lux thought, a little like Forever in the air, but mixed with something faint and less enduring, possibly the fragrance of a flower. or this: "Is the Duke afraid of laughter?" asked the Prince. "The Duke is not 318</page><page sequence="7">THE HUDSON REVIEW afraid of anything. Not even" said the guard, "The Todal." "The Todal?" "The Todal." "What's the Todal?" A lock of the guard's hair turned white and his teeth began to chatter. "The Todal looks like a blob of glup" he said. "It makes a sound like rabbits screaming, and smells of old, unopened rooms." If I have committed the key solecism of the reviewer by implying that Mr. Sale should have written another book than the one he wrote, I plead the Duke's excuse. "We all have flaws," he said, "mine is being wicked."
