MATHUR IN progress the history in science of India, and technology as in the has history not been of steady. nations, It had the progress in science and technology has not been steady. It had its ups an downs, like the rise and fall of nations. The scientific investigations have been dependent upon several factors: eras of war and peace, foresight of rulers, political stability in a country, religious attitudes of the people, freedom exercised by individuals. The most ancient archaeological records that go back to C.2500 B.C. unveil the remnants of a highly technological society, the Harappan civilization. Such progress could only have been attained by efficient administrators and superb technicians. Since the economic levels of the people did not exhibit great disparities, it can be assumed that the political conditions remained stable for a long period of time. Few religious restrictions probably gave the people freedom of movement in meeting their social and political responsibilities. The figures of mother-goddess and the phallic symbol inscribed on the seals indicate the religious trends. The Siva-lingam represents the idea of creation, and the mother- goddess denotes energy responsible for creation. A similar tradition developed in China, the principle of Yin and Yang representing the female and male agents of creation. The creator in plain, natural form, became the emblem of worship. A prayer to the Goddess, "You, the energy of the flowing waters and the rotating universe, I prostrate before you," might have come down from that distant period of history. Thus, the most ancient religious traditions in India consisted of a simple form of worship to the forces of creation, which provided a stable political system conducive to the growth * A paper presented at the 18th International Congress of the History of Science, 1st - 9th August, 1989, Hamburg, Munich, West Germany.</page><page sequence="2">68 THE TIBET JOURNAL of science and technology. The Harappan civilization which lasted from 2500 to 1500 B.C. was followed by the Aryan Conquests. The Rig Veda, the compilation of the Aryans and one of the most ancient documents of history, contains verses praising certain gods (Indra, Varuna, Agni and Soma), but there is no indication that their images were worshipped in temples or that the founders of religious rites, the priests, occupied a high place in society. The Aryan tribes were rural, agricultural warriors, constantly fighting the local, darker races, who they held in contempt. The political system was a monarchy. They were great philosophers. Some parts of the Vedas and the Upanishads in particular demonstrate their depth of vision in understanding the nature of man and universe. The Aryans knew certain technologies, the metallurgy of iron, and produced heavy ploughs and sturdy chariots and tools. They were adept archers. With these exceptions, their technological accomplishments are not as impressive as of the Harappans. Piggott thinks that the Aryan infiltration among the Harappans, "was the arrival of barbarians into a region highly organized into an empire based on long established traditions of literate urban culture." The Era of Brahmanism By 800 B.C. change took place in the civilization of the Aryans. Their discriminatory practices that were restricted to the darker people were now extended to their own tribes. They invented the doctrine of Purusha Sukta (i.e., Brahmins came from the head, Kshatriyas from the arms, Vaishyas from the thighs, and Sudras from the feet of Brahma), to legitimize caste and racial differences. Caste became hereditary, and inequality official doctrine of Brahmanism. These differences created social problems and internecine wars rather than scientific progress and individual freedom. Belief in multiplicity of gods and goddesses, animistic and anthropomorphic tendency towards syncretism, performance of animal sacrifices and complex rituals directed by the priests produced a society that lost initiative and became more and more dependent upon the spurious religious practices</page><page sequence="3">THE IMPACT OF BUDDHISM UPON INDIAN SCIENCE &amp; POLITICS 69 designed by the Brahmins. It is highly probable that the ancient scriptures were re-written, records of history destroyed, and new works compiled, primarily to enhance and enforce the prestige and power of the Brahmins. There were no further inquiries into astronomy, geometry, law and philosophy. The Brahmanical era was the end of the scientific age. The growing power of the priestly class resulted in economic and political upheavals. A new merchant class arose independent of Brahmanical control. Monarchies were dismantled. Republican forms of government emerged with elections of heads of state and assemblies. There was revolt against tradition, rituals were challenged, and claims of supernatural authority questioned. Kasyapa (700 B.C.) proposed the Doctrine of Akriyavada (amoralism), that nothing survives after death, neither body nor soul. Kapila (600 B.C.) expounded the Sankhya philosophy of atheism, that the universe was not created by God, but originated by Prakarti (matter), and Purusa (soul) forms a part of it. Mahavira (527 B.C.) taught that soul undergoes rebirth because of bad karmas (actions) in past and present life, and cannot be altered by divine interference. The Era of Buddhism In refuting the Brahmanical concepts of caste, inequality and divinity, Buddha applied scientific methods to understand the nature of God, man and universe. He said, and we now believe, that the universe consists of innumerable visible and invisible objects: suns, moons, planets, galaxies, stars, dust, and myriads of particles moving and interacting with each other. He compared the world system to the chemical system in which nothing moves independently of the other. The small, minute particles of matter, like the larger ones, are also constantly in motion and ever changing. In other words the atom is in a state of flux, it is divisible. This theory was different from the atomistic doctrine of Kannada, Epicurus and Democritus, who maintained that the atom is the smallest, indivisible part of matter. Buddha also enunciated two other theories: the theory of impermanence (aniccam), that all forms of life undergo</page><page sequence="4">70 THE TIBET JOURNAL continuous change; and the theory of spontaneous generation, that life began when right catalysts interacted with matter. The interactions go on ad infinitum, as there is no beginning nor end of the universe. This means that man evolved in the process of becoming, and was not created by God in his own image. Man too is a dynamic continuum, whose life and destiny are governed by the law of continuity and the law of karma. Happiness and misery are not rewards and punishments assigned by God to a good or evil person, but a result of one's own action, the effects of a cause. It was taught at the University of Nalanda 1500 years ago: "The world is neither governed by a God creator nor by blind chance, but by the law of spiritual and metaphysical interrelatedness which is neither simple causality nor metaphysical determinism." The focal point of Buddha's inquiry was not the religious concept of God nor the nature of the universe, but the cause of pain. To find the solution to the miseries that man has to endure from birth to death, Sakyamuni Gautama Buddha (563 - 483 B.C.) left a home, wife and child at age 29, and after intense search and meditation received enlightenment at age 35 in Bodh Gaya under a pipai tree. Through introspection by use of sense receptors and gaining true knowledge from personal experiences, Buddha cured pain (dukha) and suffering and brought relief to the sick and mentally ill. His prescription was freedom from emotional stress, subjugation of sensual pleasure, elimination of passions, maintenance of celibacy and service to the poor and needy. He advocated the middle path of righteousness, i.e., avoidanoe of extremes in both physical and mental practices as a road to peace (shanti) and bliss (anand), in the attainment of nirvana (salvation). He discovered natural laws by the scientific method of observation, formulation of hypothesis and testing the hypothesis through experimentation, experience and meditation. He said that one can draw right conclusions only after exploring all avenues. In search for truth he ignored no information, rejected no method, condemned no believers, but subjected all phenomena to a comprehensive, logical, objective analysis. It is for this reason that Buddhism rejects all dogmas and supernatural concepts of</page><page sequence="5">THE IMPACT OF BUDDHISM UPON INDIAN SCIENCE &amp; POLITICS 7 1 revelation and authoritarianism. Buddha was not opposed to Hinduism. He agreed with the Upanishad dictum: "Law is the power of the kingdom; nor is there aught higher than the law." He observed that original Vedas contained good doctrines, but were corrupted later with the establishment of hereditary priesthood, incorporation of unfounded stories about unknown Gods, and introduction of worthless ceremonies which never accomplished anything. He rejected the idea that only the Brahmins are the compendium of knowledge and said, "The measure of man is his worth and not birth. As the shadow follows the form, and the smoke comes from the fire, so effect follows cause and suffering and bliss follows the thoughts and deeds of men." The Impact on Science The fundamental principal of the Buddhist doctrine: that inquiries should be based on the scientific investigation of mind and matter, on experience and experimentation rather than blind acceptance of any theories and systems of philosophy or religion, was the one that prompted people to test the validity of the experimental method. Since Buddha proclaimed that his ideas were open for discussion and critical examination, the Brahmins were the first to take him up on it. When they found Buddhist ideas convincing and realized the weakness of Brahmanism, they converted to Buddhism, and assisted in the development of new thinking and new technologies in the country. It is for this reason that Buddha's impact on science, education and politics has been profound. The great king Bimbisara of Magadha, who became a follower of Buddha, built schools for training in vocational subjects and hospitals for the treatment of humans and animals. Monasteries were established to produce kind, gentle, enlightened human beings who could achieve salvation through education, meditation and experimentation. Great universities of Nalanda, Vikramsila, Valabhi and others were established by generous endowments from emperors, kings, and wealthy merchants. The Chinese scholar I-tsing was greatly impressed by the professors he met there. At these universities both spiritual and scientific</page><page sequence="6">72 THE TIBET JOURNAL subjects were taught: grammar, metaphysics, theology, logic, Upanishads, Vaisesika and Nyaya systems, as well as mathematics, astronomy, music, painting and architecture. Astronomical observatories recorded the motion of sun, moon, and planets, which led Aryabhata to propose the epicyclic theory of planetary motion. It was the scientific aspect of Buddhism that generated technological progress in India: construction of artistic stupas, erection of huge statues of Buddha, and production of implements of copper, bronze and iron by master craftsmen. The pillar of wrought iron built near Delhi in the fifth century is considered "a triumph of skill in handling a refractory metal." The cave temples of Ajanta are a marvel in painting. Nagaijuna mastered the art of surgery in the second century B.C. At the university of Nalanda, which lasted from the fifth to the thirteenth century, research in medicine included several branches: circulatory, respiratory, digestive, muscular, nervous and reproductive systems. From the non-technical, authoritarian age of Brahmanism, India was transformed into the practical, experimental era of Buddhism, which greatly contributed towards the progress of science and technology for a thousand years. The Political Impact This scientific progress was a result of political encouragement and financial support received from several rulers for a long period of time. This, in turn, demonstrated that the countries where scientific developments are taking place tend to introduce a political system that encourages freedom of thought and a democratic way of life. Conversely, far-sighted rulers seek advice of able scholars who encourage the pursuit of scientific activities. Asoka (247 B.C.), the great Buddhist emperor said: "The emancipation of the mind and spirit is a necessary preliminary Tor the political emancipation of the people." It was the influence of Buddhist monks upon kings and potentates that resulted in administrations conducive to the welfare of the society. Among the enlightened rulers were the Greek king Menander of Punjab (147 B.C.), a disciple of</page><page sequence="7">THE IMPACT OF BUDDHISM UPON INDIAN SCIENCE &amp; POLITICS 73 Nagsena, his political advisor. Emperor Kanishka's eminent rule was guided by the famous Ashvaghosa. King Yajusari Gautamiputra of Andhra's benevolent regime was advised by Nagaijuna. Emperor Samudragupta donated extensive territory to the king of Sri Lanka for the construction of sangrahms and monasteries at Bodh Gaya for the students of his country. The Gupta emperors successively subsidized monasteries and universities. The Palla kings of Bengal founded and funded the great university of Vikramsila for centuries. King Ajatastru, who succeeded the throne of Magadha by threatening to kill his father, and had supported Devadatta's unsuccessful scheme to kill Buddha, sent his Minister Varsakara to obtain Buddha's blessings on his design of attacking the state of Vrji, which was denied and the project abandoned. The kings of Tibet regularly communicated with the Indian monks, sent students to the Buddhist universities, and invited eminent professors to instil the right spirit of Buddhism there. The appearance of Atisa, the High Priest of Vikramsila at a conference held by Lha Lama Changchub Od of Tibet in 1038 is recorded thus: "there came Lord Atisa, the venerable of venerables, in all his glory, at whose sight, the eyes felt no satiety... There was brightness mixed with simplicity of expression, which acted as a magical spell upon those who beheld him." We have already seen that protests against Brahmanical practices in the seventh and eighth centuries B.C. contributed toward the emergence of Republican forms of government. These governments were the reservoirs of future development in science and technology. Buddha was acquainted with those democratic governments and implemented the concept of equality of men by establishing Republican forms of government in monasteries. The governing structure of the university of Nalanda was similar to the modern parliamentary practice of electing a speaker and whip. Buddha advised the monarchs to heed the recommendations of elected assemblies, uphold justice, appoint efficient administrators, expand industries, prevent poverty, punish the wrong-doers, and to be gentle, tolerant, and kind. The</page><page sequence="8">74 THE TIBET JOURNAL celebrated Chinese pilgrims, Fa Hian, who came during the reign of Chandragupta II, and Hiuen Tsang during the reign of Harsha, give a striking account of the wealth and prosperity of the people in a country well governed by able and just rulers. The message of Buddha was not always relished by the rulers, nor did the Buddhist emperors relinquish war and become peaceful. But whenever a few precepts were followed, the kingdom remained relatively peaceful and progressive. Despite the intermittent invasions of Huns, the political situation generally remained stable, because of the implementation of a governmental system based on justice and the support of the people. The Rise of Hinduism and the Demise of Buddhism Hinduism, which had existed alongside Buddhism, was always conspiring to gain political power, and to re-establish the caste system. One of the first attempts to gain power was made when the last Mauryan emperor, Brihadartha was murdered by his Commander-in-Chief in 187 B.C., who brought anarchy throughout the empire. Until the time of Harsha (187 B.C. to 647 A.D.). attempts were made to gain power, but without any marked success. After poisoning Harsha in 647, the Brahmins maneuvered to dismantle the empire and install under their tutelage foreign young puppets from Central Asia as kings of small territories, such as Ajmer, Delhi, Kanauj. In the East, Bengal was usurped in 700 A.D. by Adisura, an orthodox. Adisura was a despotic king and was overthrown by the people who elected Gopal, a Buddhist king. The Palla dynasty ruled until 1158 A.D., when Valla Sena, another Hindu fundamentalist, came to power. The atrocities committed by the Senas were responsible for the conquest of Bengal by the Muslims. By the eighth century A.D. the laws of inequality were re- enforced, the epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata re-structured to impress the superiority of the priestly class, exquisite temples were constructed and idols placed representing a pantheon of gods and goddesses, and the untouchables were de-humanized in accordance with the Laws of Manu: "If a Sudra spoke ill of a</page><page sequence="9">THE IMPACT OF BUDDHISM UPON INDIAN SCIENCE &amp; POLITICS 75 Brahmin his tongue should be cut off, if he listened to the recitation of the Vedas the ears should be stuffed with molten lava, and if he remembered Vedic texts his body should be split in two." There was no support for universities, no open discussions were allowed in temples, no scientific programs sustained. The sack of Somnath of Sultan Mahmud clearly indicates the state of degradation of Hindu society. Alberuni, the great Muslim scholar, who accompanied Mahmud to India in 1023 A.D., praised India's past accomplishments in science and technology, but faulted the contemporary Hindus as ignorant, vain and unscientific. The end of Hindu rule was imminent. In 1199 Bakhtiaruddin Khilji, a General of Muhammad Ghori, burnt the great university of Nalanda, and the other universities soon after, along with the monasteries, priceless libraries, unique observatories, the sleeping monks, students and faculty. A few who survived ran away to Tibet. Thus ended the last flicker of science and technology and the republican forms of government that subsisted as a consequence of Buddhist teachings. India remained independent as long as it was ruled by Buddhist monarchs. When India became a victim to the doctrine of inequality and the worship of innumerable gods and goddesses, when the burden of defense was placed upon a small minority of Kshatriyas, the wheels of progress were turned back. The end of freedom was the fruit of Hindu fundamentalism. In conclusion, the Buddhist period in India, which lasted a thousand years, was based on the principles of equality, justice and righteousness. It promulgated an era of scientific investigation, and created democratic forms of government in which decisions were made in consultation with the elected assemblies of people. But when priests become victims of lust, greed and political power, and create a society based on hereditary inequality, the governments become corrupt, scientific research takes a back seat, and autocratic rulers curb individual freedom as they become pawns in the hands of religious leaders. This is how a country disintegrates, people lose their freedom, and true religion suffers. This is the inference that we derive from the study of Buddhism in Indian history.</page><page sequence="10">76 THE TIBET JOURNAL References: Ahir, D.C. India's Debt to Buddhism.
