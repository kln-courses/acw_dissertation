<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS * AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. II, No. 4: Oct., 1965 Causes and Conditions, J. L. MACKIE A formal analysis of both singular and general causal statements is given, which relates them to incompletely known universal laws of the "regularity" type. It is shown that this analysis overcomes many well known difficulties for a regularity view (for example, it resolves problems about the "covering-law model" for causal statements and explanations in history) and also that it fits in exactly with our basic methods of dis covering causal relationships, as formalised in an improved account of the Method of Difference. It is indicated how this analysis of causal state ments can be extended to cover those that are based on functional depend ence rather than necessity and sufficiency, and how this extended analysis fits in with the discovery of causal relationships by the Method of Con comitant Variation (of which a correspondingly improved account is sug gested) . There are brief remarks about the direction of causation. Symposium on Inductive Evidence, WESLEY C. SALMON, S. F. BARKER, H. KYBURG Salmon's lead paper has two parts. Arguing that an adequate analysis of inductive evidence presupposes a justification of induction, the first part attacks the view that the problem of induction dissolves because of the intimate relationship between the concepts of rational belief and inductive support. In defense of Strawson et al., Barker objects that the problem of justification cannot even be formulated coherently without an understanding of inductive correctness. Rejecting the claim of Carnap et al., that inductive intuitions are analogous to "seeing" that modus ponens is valid, Salmon's second part attacks the view that inductive intuition is the final arbiter of inductive correctness. Kyburg replies that satisfaction of intuitive require ments is all that can sensibly be demanded of inductive methods. Salmon's answer to both critics is a challenge to show how rationality can be ex plicated if it has nothing to do with inductive success. * Abstracts of articles from leading philosophical journals are published as a regular feature of the Review.

S. CHIHARA, J. A. FODOR This paper explores some lines of argument in Wittgenstein's post Tractatus writings in order to indicate the relations between Wittgenstein's philosophical psychology, on the one hand, and his philosophy of language, his epistemology, and his doctrines about the nature of philosophical analysis on the other. The authors maintain that the later writings of Wittgenstein express a coherent doctrine in which an operationalistic analysis of confirmation and language supports a philosophical psychology of a type the authors call "logical behaviorism." They also maintain that there are good grounds for rejecting the philosophical theory implicit in Wittgenstein's later works. In particular, they first argue that Witt genstein's position leads to some implausible conclusions concerning the nature of language and psychology; second, they maintain that the argu ments Wittgenstein provides are inconclusive; and third, they sketch an alternative position which they believe avoids many of the difficulties im plicit in Wittgenstein's philosophy. A Vindication of Scientific Inductive Practices, BRIAN ELLIS In this essay, it is shown that the rational preferability of using certain inductive rules (e.g., the straight rule) might be demonstrated by argu ments of the kind used by Reichenbach and Salmon, only if it is assumed that the things we are dealing with are theoretically isolated. However, if this assumption is made, then a further argument shows that a knowledge of which inductive rules we must follow does not help us at all to make predictions about the unknown. Hence the theoretical involvement of the subject-matter of our inductive arguments (as opposed to its theoretical isolation) appears to be a necessary condition for the possibility of making rational predictions about that subject-matter. It is then argued that if a given sequence of events, as it stands, conforms to currently accepted scien tific theory, then we are faced with two and only two rational alternatives for projecting this sequence (e.g., into the future): a) to project it in such a way that the projected sequence conforms to currently accepted scientific theory, or b) to devise an alternative theoretical framework, that is equally acceptable on the basis of what has happened, and project the sequence in conformity with it. Various objections to this thesis are considered. Propositions as Answers, J. E. LLEWELYN An examination is made of Collingwood's criticisms of so-called 'prop ositional' logicians like Cook Wilson and Russell who are charged with assuming that meaning, agreement, contradiction, truth, and falsity do not belong only to propositions as the answers to strictly correlative questions. It is doubtful whether these logicians do assume this. Anyway, they would be correct to do so or to assume that these semiotic predicates can be known to apply to propositions without one's knowing to which strictly</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 395 correlative question each proposition could be an answer. Failure to dis tinguish accurately what a person says from the topic of his remark and the reference of a word or phrase that he uses leads Collingwood to overlook the difficulty that ambiguity of reference can infect questions no less than asser tions. He is himself prey to the fallacy that the logician's proposition is a double of the indicative sentence of traditional grammar. Can a Smell or a Taste or a Touch be Beautiful?, FRANCIS J. COLEMAN At the risk of eccentricity, I have argued that the sensations of taste, smell, and touch can be beautiful, and that the beauty of some experiences would be diminished if reference to them were omitted. I considered the chief arguments against this thesis: such sensations cannot be beautiful because (1) they are not spoken of that way; (2) they are simple data; (3) they cannot be combined to form unities; (4) they only give pleasure; (5) they cannot have internal relations; (6) they are utilitarian; (7) they vary greatly in appeal; (8) *they are the "lower senses." My arguments for the thesis are: (1) that the blind do not infer but directly experience the beauty of, e.g., the Elgin Marbles; (2) that the analysis of some expres sions, e.g., "a beautiful dinner," entail reference to the "lower senses"; (3) that our experience of some objects of art is as unintellectual and sensuous as our experience of a rare odor; (4) that certain beautiful expe riences involve all the senses; (5) that some persons refer to these senses when giving reasons for aesthetic judgments. Seeming to See, CLEMENT DORE * DOCUMENTACI?N CR?TICA IBEROAMERICANA Year 1, No. 1: Oct.-Dec, 1964 Philosophical Criticism: Theory, Situation, Purpose, J. ARELLANO Scientific criticism has its ontological basis in knowledge as capable of universalization. In the absence of authentic criticism some inauthentic forms of criticism will inevitably obtain. Such are for instance common adulation, opposition without genuine intellectual comprehension, defining one's own position in contrast with those of others without attempting to build a positive doctrine, or simply using any form of kinship to make acceptable "our own" opinions against "alien" ones. Historically we have in the immediate future an urgent task: the liberation of theory from ideology. Existence as dedicated to interpretation (theory) must be sub stituted for all present vital interpretive compromises (ideologies). Subse quently theory will show itself as capable of supporting an ideological pluralism. Scientific dogmatism and ideologism generally invert the terms in which pluralism takes a form. They make impossible the intrinsic, constitutive freedom of interpretive existence which is the only guarantee for * This abstract appeared in the September issue.</page><page sequence="4">396 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS an adequate ideological freedom. The purpose of criticism however has to be a passing beyond "cultural nominalism." From Substantiality to Substantivity in X. Zubiri, PEDRO CEREZO GALAN The study of essence is carried out by Zubiri, in his latest contribu tions, in constant dialogue with Aristotle; but Zubiri insists that the moment of substantivity must be prior to that of "being a subject." This is not the case in Aristotle's determination of a substance which is always a function of being a subject, either in the logical sense or in the physical sense of supporting properties (substanding). As a subject?continues Zubiri?sub stance is per se specific; and therefore concrete being is not free in Aristotle from the abstract character given to substance by Plato. There seems to be, however, some injustice to Aristotle in these remarks according to the author of this article. The subject as a substantive structure is as individ ualized in Aristotle as Zubiri would demand. The true problem of essence in Aristotle has been rightly pointed by Owens: "It cannot be a universal, and yet it has to be the basis of the specific identity of singular things. It cannot be singular, yet it has to cause the individual unity in the sensible thing. Under all these limitations can the sensible form be the primary instance of Entity?" (The Doctrine of Being in the Aristotelian Metaphysics, p. 236). The Idea of a Transcendental Order in X. Zubiri, J. ARELLANO Zubiri's investigations on essence coincide with recent trends of phe nomenology in their transcendental realism. Essence is given here a tran scendental function which explains its categorical function as a substantive structure. As transcendental, essence places the individual reality known as a structure in an order of inter-related properties which is the order of reality. In its categorial function essence specifies an entity; in its tran scendental function essence gives us an "impression of reality" which consti tutes the continuity of the living world. Both the scientific notion of sub stance as a structure and the philosophico-phenomenological notion of essence as a com-ponent of the world are coordinated in Zubiri's theory. Transcendental realism however must itself be placed in a systematic con text of philosophical positions integrated by materialism at the spontaneous, critical, and absolute levels, idealism which can also be spontaneous, critical, and absolute, and realism which tends to crystallize at the same three levels. The critical position in all three tendencies would always substitute reality? a naked fact?for being, and so does science. The existence of absolute positions in all three tendencies points however to metaphysics as an in escapable perspective of the transcendental order from the standpoint of being. Unity and Respectiveness in Zubiri, JOAQU?N FERRER The conception of essence, the elaboration of the character of sub stantiality in reality, are possible in Zubiri thanks to a theory of unity which underlies the assemblage of the essential notes. Essential notes must be</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 397 differentiated from other inherent notes and from causal relations in that they are foundational notes and therefore they cannot be referred to any other foundation. These notes are constituent moments of the reality of the essence qua reality. But if these notes cannot be referred to any other foundation they are referred to each other as system constituents. What is this inner orientation of essential notes to each other? It cannot be a rela tion proper since relations presuppose their terms as already constituted and not as constituent of anything. Relations also must have a ground objec tively established, but the essential notes are not in relation to each other, they are intrinsically respective to each other. Here we have a unity which is superior to composition, addition or coordination. Nor are we faced here with a unity of inherence. Substantial notes are not therefore in a relation as between determinable and determinating factors, they are in a mutual respective codetermination factors, they are in a mutual respective codetermination, founding a special type of unity that Zubiri labels as unity of coherence. The inner and outer continuity of essential notes as world-forming properties is an original contribution of Zubiri's which sanctions philosophically a theory widely held by science. Year II, No. 2: Jan.-March, 1965 Effective Philosophical Dialogue, EUGENIO FRUTOS Philosophical dialogue has proven over the centuries to be less effective than scientific dialogue and as a result philosophy "has not found the sure path of science" as Kant wanted, nor has it constituted itself as "a rigorous science" as Husserl advocated. Difficulties in philosophical dialogue orig inate both in the dialoguing individuals and in the unverifiability of the conclusions. There are however great strides to be made in the techniques of philosophical meetings and conventions. The short duration of these, the lack of a joint approach to the questions proposed, and even the arti ficialities of a not thoroughly thought out agenda all point to a vast room for improvement. The tradition of dialogue by correspondence seems to be disappearing fast. The difficulty of effective dialogue seems to have made a decisive impression in contemporary minds. Our readiness will likely yield abundant fruit.

The second covers the whole evolution of thought in Argentina up to con temporary schools. With the independence, the question of the identity</page><page sequence="6">398 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS of Argentinian thought becomes an issue about which bibliography is still fragmentary. A complete examination of the period is anticipated by the preliminary efforts of Diego F. Pro, efforts which will no doubt bring forth a comprehensive study of that transitional period. What follows is an analysis of contemporary Argentinian thought summarizing a previous work by the author of this article, viz., La Filosof?a Argentina Actual (Universidad de Cordoba, 1962). All the tendencies of a rich and well diversified philo sophical present are critically reviewed. A great wealth of bibliographical notes is given in every page and a selected list is added at the end. Problems in the Philosophy of Science and Nature in the Soviet Union, SIEGFRIED MULLER-MARKUS This article reflects the philosophical positions of the most eminent thinkers of the USSR as collected in the 1958 communications to the general convention on philosophical problems of the natural sciences in Moscow (German ed. [Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1962]). This collection is the first expression of positions reconciling dialectical materialism with quantum mecanics and the theory of relativity after the rigid philosophical stand of the Stalin era. The positions closer to dogmatic dialectical mate rialism are those of Mittin, official philosopher since 1932, I. V. Kutsnesof, and Omelyanofskii. On the other hand there are those who would in corporate conclusions from the latest scientific theories into dialectical mate rialism. Among the latter the most influential are Fock and the math ematician A. D. Alexandrof, Chancellor of the University of Leningrad. The main areas discussed are cosmology, cybernetics, biology, and psy chology. The contributions of the physical scientists reveal a considerable freedom of thought, especially those of Alexandrof on the absolute structure of space and time, Ambarsumian on methodological aspects of cosmology, and Fock on elementary states in quantum mechanics. Finitude and Guilt in the Philosophy of Paul Ric ur, BERNHARD WALDENFELD The main influences in the thought of Ricceur are Merleau-Ponty, Jaspers, and Marcel. His position within the phenomenological movement reached a high point after his translation of and commentary on the Ideen in 1950. His is a metaphysics of the will which is acquiring systematic form in his latest sizable treatises, three of which have already been com pleted and the fourth of which awaits publication. In Le volontaire et l'involontaire, we have a fundamental ontology of existence in three parts, dealing with existence as a free design, the free use of body and its powers (operational embodiment), and consentment to the circumstance. In the subsequent works the theme of finitude and guilt is seen through the prism of "free variation." Evil is critical experience par excellence, since it carries with it the danger of dissolution of the ties of man with the environ ment of the holy, and therefore brings forth with the greatest intensity the dependence of man upon the power of the holy.</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 399 INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. V, No. 3: Sept., 1965 The Axiological Theism of W. M. Urban, J. PRESCOTT JOHNSON Professor Urban developed three relatively distinct theories of value. A psychological theory defines value as the funded affective-volitional mean ing of an object for a subject. According to a philosophical approach, value is an objective ought-to-be which transcends being. In a theological theory value is identified with being. In this article I show how, meth odologically, these three approaches to the value problem are to some extent unified as based upon the principle of sufficient reason. I then show how, substantively, the former two axiologies give way to and are complemented by the theological view, that of axiological theism, in which value and being are identified. Finally, I discuss certain epistemological problems involved in the identification of value and being, both as such and in the context of Urban's earlier, provisional value theories. An Impasse in Philosophical Theology, PETER BERTOCCI An impasse in philosophical theology exists when certain knowledge is demanded of a necessary and perfect God. For, as Kant argues, there is no certain access to the "ideal without a flaw" either by cosmological or teleological arguments. Tillich backs out if this impasse by holding that reason presupposes the unity of knower and Reality. For him, either rational and mystical certainty or skepticism; either identity or estrange ment. Yet the certainty that is presumably guaranteed by this "onto logical" approach is undermined because all the symbols man uses to describe such a God are imperfect. Is the "ideal" of indubitable knowledge of a "flawless" God a worthwhile ideal if its very nature sets up an im passable chasm between the conditioned and the unconditioned? A way out of the impasse is suggested. Religion and Contemporary Philosophical Thought, C. A. QADIR The anti-religious tendency of contemporary philosophical thought is strengthened by the Logical Positivistic criterion of meaningfulness, accord ing to which the language of religion is nonsensical and absurd. In com mon with the Logical Positivists, Prof. Braithwaite, holds that, of all the three conditions by which the truth of a statement can be determined, religious discourse does not fulfill any. It is asserted, accordingly, that religious language is either anthropomorphic or it means nothing. The article subjects the criterion of meaningfulness to a searching analysis and exposes its hollowness. It is contended that all that the Logical Posi tivists can say, on the basis of the criterion, is that the Language of religion is neither tautologous nor descriptive, but the further conclusion that it is meaningless is, to use legal terminology, excessive. It is also argued that the dilemma posed above can be "escaped." The meaningfulness of the religious language can be discovered in the context of analogy, obedience,</page><page sequence="8">400 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS and encounter. Distinctions are made between analogies of attribution and proportionality, and also between what Sayyid Ahmad Khan calls, lan guages of first and second import. In conclusion it is maintained that though analogy, obedience, and encounter, taken alone would not be free from defects, taken together, they furnish an existential context within which the meaning of religious language can be sought. Toward an Integral Philosophy of Man, AGUST?N BASAVE FERNANDEZ DEL VALLE The Imagination in Plato, RAY L. HART Four views of the imagination in the Platonic corpus are discriminated. The fourth is defended as that of the "mature" Plato. 1. The imagination is aesthesis, the undifferentiated awareness of phenomena. A distinctive mental operation having as its object a meta physically homogeneous class of images, it makes no cognitive claim and involves no judgment. 2. The imagination is mimetic, phantastic, and sophistic. Thrice removed from real being, it copies appearances with a view to stimulating passions and so involves a false claim to cognition. 3. Imagination is necessary for the cognition of some real structures. Icastically, it expresses non-imaginal apprehensions in lively figure; dia noetically, it makes accessible through specific images essentially rational structures otherwise inaccessible. 4. Imagination is the mental form of maximum cognitive participa tion in "process." Directed toward "becoming," imagination intends the order of things and events in their concreteness. Through its images the harmonic soul is maximally involved in the order of the "mixed," which is inaccessible thinking and rational intuition. On Caring, MILTON MAYERHOFF Caring, in the most significant sense, is to help the other to grow and realize itself. The other may be a person, a "brain child," a com munity, etc. Concepts such as identity-in-difference, devotion, growth, trust, humility, patience, hope, freedom, and responsibility are used to make caring intelligible. In the context of a man's life, caring has a way of ordering his other activities around itself. When a man's carings are comprehensive enough to fruitfully order all spheres of his life around them, he is in place in the world. In place contrasts with being "out of place" and insensitivity to any sense of place. The natural expression of being in place is gratitude. Psycho-Chemistry and the Religious Consciousness, JEAN HOUSTON This paper attempts to explore the phenomenon of psycho-chemically evoked states of consciousness similar to those attendant upon religious experience. It describes one of the research programs of The Foundation for Mind Research: the creation and clinical evaluation of religious-type</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 401 experiences induced through the ingestion of LSD-25. Involving over one hundred case studies the program reveals that 40 % of the subjects become involved in symbolic or phylogenetic experience wherein significant myth and ritual themes appear to be experienced or "lived" with dramatic clarity. Only a few subjects would seem to undergo religious or mystic-type expe rience. Those who have, however, report a remarkable similarity in the structure and development of their experience?often speaking in terms of well-known religious and mystical analogues. The paper concludes with a descriptive phenomenology of the religious consciousness as it is evoked in the LSD experience. Reflections on Heidegger's Development: Apropos of a recent Book, ALPHONSE DE WAELHENS After a brief commentary on the monumental new work of William Richardson, s.j., Heidegger: Through Phenomenology to Thought, the author presents his own analysis of the development of Heidegger's thought throughout his works, for the most part agreeing with, but sometimes signif icantly differing from, that of Richardson. He examines the two points of view of Heidegger, early and late, one considering Being from the point of man, who gives utterance to it, the other considering man from the point of view of Being as primary. Admitting the continuity in Heidegger's own thought, the author questions seriously the philosophical viability of the later point of view. An immanentist account of Being through man, right or wrong, is a consistent philosophical position which can be expressed in human terms; whereas to speak of man from the viewpoint of Being is a task beyond the capacities of man or his language, at least of his philo sophical language. THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. LXII, No. 13: June 24, 1965 The Logic of Change, Action, and Norms, HECTOR NERI CASTA?EDA This is an attempt to clarify some points in the logic of norms via a critical examination of G. H. Von Wright's Norm and Action. In this book Von Wright makes an admirable attempt at formulating the formal prop ositional logic of norms and assertions about actions. To this end he successfully develops four beautiful calculi: (a) one for the elementary logic of change, (b) one for the logic of action, (c) one for the general logic of norms, and (d) one for the logic of hypothetical norms. The examination of these calculi yields the following conclusions: (a) is an excellent formalization of a small part of the logic of change, and it should be developed further; (b) suffers from a serious ambiguity in the inter pretation of the operator *T,' but it can be corrected along the lines of a</page><page sequence="10">402 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS suggested operator 'T*'; it should be improved and developed further with both operators; (c) is in need of greater revisions, but it may repay to revise it and extend it; (d) is based on the serious misunderstanding that a norm or command includes as essential ingredients its conditions of application; besides, its operator '/' has an ambiguity; as deontic calculus (d) is seriously inadequate, and should, perhaps, be tested for non-deontic interpretations. The Methods of Ethics and the Methods of Science, J. J. C. SMART This paper discusses the methodology of ethics from the point of view of an act utilitarianism, though it is hoped that much of it will be relevant to the methodology of other systems of ethics. The question is whether gen eral ethical principles should be tested by their particular consequences, or whether, rather, our particular moral feelings should be assessed in the light of general principles. Most writers on ethics suggest that the former is the case, but it is contended that this may rest on a false analogy with science. However the paper shows sympathy for both points of view, and it is sug gested that no moral theory (whether utilitarian or deontololgical) may be able to appeal to all sides of our nature. Criticisms of act utilitarianism by Landesman and McCloskey are discussed. Vol. LXII, No. 14: July 15, 1965 Ontic Commitment and the Empty Universe, CHUNG-YING CHENG, MICHAEL DAVID RESNIK In standard quantificational theory the validity of a quantificational schema such as (3 a?) (Fa; v^ Fx) is defined over nonempty universes. The objection has been made, however, that, because of this, logic will force existence claims upon us. To avoid this objections, it has been suggested that Quine's criterion of ontic commitment be modified in such a way that quantificational logic should not commit us to at least one thing. The pur pose of this paper is to show that this problem is not as serious as it appears. After accepting the standard definition of quantificational validity, one can always make a distinction between defining quanticational validity and inter preting quantifiers in a quantificational schema, and then there need be no alarm that the standard quantificational theory should force any particular existence claims upon us; for the exclusion of empty universes from the stand ard definition of quantificational validity does not entail ontic commitment to particular things. Indeed, for any consistent theory formalized in quantificational logic, if there is at least one true existence statement, the adoption of standard quantificational theory will lead to much simplicity. Questions concerning the use of the idiom "T is ontically committed to x" and identity conditions of ontologies are probed. It is suggested that since ontologies require stronger identity conditions than classes, an ade quate formulation of these would be a challenge to logical philosophers.</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 403 Implicit Definition Once Again, FRED WILSON The claim that uninterpreted axioms "implicitly define" the primitive descriptive signs they contain could only be based on the belief that there exists some fairly close analogy between a sign's being ("explicitly") defined and a sign's occurring as primitive in an axiomatic system. In Part I, I show that the two kinds of "definition," so-called, differ in two respects which are so crucial that the use of the same word cannot but be mis leading: Quine has recently presented himself as a defender of "implicit definition." However, his real purpose is to argue that the analytic-syn thetic distinction cannot be explicated. He claims to be able to find for every true scientific theory an axiomatic development of the same theory whose truths follow deductively from those of arithmetic. In Part II dis tinctions are made which show that the two axiomatic developments are not of the same theory. Thus, Quine 's argument fails. Vol. LXII, No. 15: Aug. 5, 1965 Memory, JANET A. KOURANY I attempt, in this paper, to offer a new reason for a belief in memory, in the form of a demonstration of the necessity of its existence for an explanation of present experience. Beginning with a consideration of issues concerned with the nature of events, the present, and, in particular, the rela tion of the present to the occurrence of an event perceptually involving change, it is found that the last can be adequately described only by analysis of the event into a series of "static situations" whose consecutive occurrence is perceived during the series of times consecutively characterized as "now." Consequently, for the observer to comprehend that some temporally finite continuous process of change is occurring, he must relate each individually perceived static situation with those preceding and succeeding it, a feat which necessitates, with his present observation of some one static situation of the event, his memory of previous, temporally-ordered observations. Vol. LXII, No. 16: Aug. 26, 1965 The Analytic and the Non-empirical, J. M. E. MORAVCSIK In surveying recent attempts to clarify "analytic" it is pointed out that the formula ('x is analytic if it is true in virtue of the meanings of its constituents" is unintelligible by the substitution of either 'proposition' or 'sentence' for '#.' Against Donnellan it is urged that non-detachable pred ication relates only determinates and determinables, not species and genera. Against Putnam it is argued that there are no one-criterion terms, and against Quine it is urged that one cannot both deny the existence of a priori (analytic) propositions and maintain the unintelligibility of the a priori empirical (analytic-synthetic) distinction. Constructively, it is argued that</page><page sequence="12">404 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS there is a variety of non-empirical propositions and that within this we can locate some philosophic propositions. The traditional notion of analyticity is regarded as a cluster-concept in which not all of the parts entail each other. Vol. LXII, No. 18: Sept. 23, 1965 Two Arguments against a Private Language, MORELAND PERKINS LW's argument of #202, #258- #259, Investigations, occurs as a formal deduction amounting, informally, to a proof that the falsehood of R, "Smith uses 'E' to refer" is entailed by truth of U, "No one else can under stand Smith's use of 'E'," given these three premisses: (1) If (Smith's use of 'E' is part of a practice), then not U. (2) If not P, then not (Smith either uses 'E' correctly or incorrectly). (3) If P, then C. But a dilemma arises: If 'practice' means "social practice," (2) is false, by LW's own #243; if 'practice' allows "solitary practice," (1) is ungrounded; #206-#207 give possible grounds for (1), but these are not original in LW. So a new argument is offered (not in but grounded in LW) that limits itself to inner mental events (IME), construes capacity to refer to IME as (roughly) entailing occasional verbal communication of IME, and so con cludes that no "solitary practice"?hence no private language?could gen erate reference to IME, nor, therefore, to the self (nor, therefore, to any thing?). Performatives, ALEXANDER SESONSKE Functions of language are distinguishable via the effects of speech acts on human relations. Utterances alter three sorts of human relations: 1. Psychological relations: one person has knowledge of or some feeling or attitude toward another. 2. Generative relations: an action of one person brings about some act or state in another. 3. Formal relations: persons are formally related when appropriate or permissible interaction between them is defined or determined by implicit or explicit conventions or rules accepted within a community. Formal rela tions guide a major portion of our activity. Performatives are utterances whose point is to alter format relations. In the proper context an utterance constitutes an event which renders some actions permissible, prohibited, or obligatory. Once the utterance occurs formal relations are different. To utter an ostensible performative sin cerely, implies that the necessary conditions for its propriety are fulfilled; hence the speaker may be held responsible for fulfillment of these conditions. Vol. LXII, No. 17: Sept. 9, 1965 Modality and Identity: A Defense, N. L. WILSON If a two-place predicate is symmetrical, transitive, and reflexive and conforms to Leibniz' law of universal substitutivity, then and only then</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 405 (how else?) does the predicate qualify as an identity sign. Now let a modal language contain *p = h' (for 'Phosphorus is necessarily identical with Hesperus'), 'p^h' and fp = h.' The sign ' = ' is Leibnizian, the ' = ' a non Leibnizian, extensional equivalence sign, 'pfh' is true and entails (3x)(3y)(x^y &amp; x = p &amp; y = h) which looks uncomfortably as if it says that Phosphorus and Hesperus are two distinct things. Reply: lp = h' can be shown to be a word for word translation of 'Phosphorus is identical with Hesperus' from the non-modal metalanguage. Hence ' = ' in the modal language is a translation of the Leibnizian 'identical with' and ' = ' is the "counting" sign. Proposal: A sign is an identity sign if it is in a simple language and is Leibnizian or (it is in a complex language and is not Leibnizian but) is a translation of a Leibnizian sign. MIND Vol. LXIV, No. 294: July, 1965 Category Mistakes and Rules of Language, BERNARD HARRISON Does the mistakenness of category-mistaken utterances consist in their ignoring the cleavages between distinct Modes of Being, or simply in their "breaking the rules of our language"; and if the latter, what sort of lin guistic rules do they break? The limitations of Ryle's account of category differences are discussed; these suggest the conclusion that the notion of category is, after all, philosophically uninteresting. Arguments for resisting this conclusion are advanced; fresh criteria for distinguishing category mis takes from mistakes of usage and grammatical mistakes are proposed, and the problem of the nature of category mistakes connected with the problem of the nature of philosophical discovery. A tentative solution to the former problem is developed, involving the notion of a "linguistic device," none of the rules of which are either straightforwardly "syntactic" or straight forwardly "semantic." Emotion, GEORGE PITCHER A traditional view of the emotions, according to which an emotion is a special kind of inner feeling or experience, is attacked on the grounds that it cannot account for the intentionality of emotions, nor for their degree of reasonableness. Another view of the emotions is then presented and de fended. According to it, emotions typically consist of some combination of the following: certain kinds of cognitive elements, evaluations, and sensa tions. (Sensations are alleged to be characteristic of most, but not all, emotions.) Some uses of emotion-words are then discussed. The author's view of emotions, it is contended, can account for these uses, for the inten tionality of emotions, for their reasonableness or unreasonableness, and for the degree of control that reason can exercise over them.</page><page sequence="14">406 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Counterfactuals and Subjunctive Conditionals, M. R. AYERS Philosophers talk of a special problem about the analysis or verification of a category of statements they call either counterfactual or subjunctive conditionals. But neither counterfactuality nor the subjunctive mood can affect either analysis or verification?or, therefore, category. It is presupposed in the "problem" that a conditional cannot be verified or falsified unless it is fulfilled. Even if this were true, it would not generate separate categories of verifiable and unverifiable conditionals. Since it is false, not even "If p then q, but not p" raises special difficulties. Sceptical presuppositions, plus the desire to eliminate unverifiables, lead to a truth-functional analysis of empirical conditionals, which in turn relies on the spurious division into two categories. The multiplication of types of statement is also an inheritance from the distinction between "actual" and "merely hypothetical" entities. Empirical conditionals must be explained without such a bogus bifurcation. The Theory of Descriptions, etc., present suggestive parallels. Abstract Entities and Universals, MANLEY THOMPSON Aristotle's Syllogistic and the Fourth Figure, LYNN E. ROSE Just as Aristotle represented the single proposition with two letters (e.g., AB), and meant the left to be the predicate and the right the subject, so he represented the syllogism with three letters (e.g., ABC), and meant the three pairs of letters (AB, BC, and AC) to represent the three proposi tions. Such a notation precludes any fourth figure. Where P is the major, M the middle, and S the minor, the terms can be arranged in only three ways: PMS, MPS, and PSM?the first, second, and third Aristotelian figures. This interpretation explains in a single way both Aristotle's manner of presenting counter-examples and his manner of describing the positions of the terms in each figure. It also illuminates the convention of writing the major premiss first, Aristotle's choice of letters in each figure, and his failure to discuss the distribution of terms and the rules of the syllogism. Time, Truth, and Modalities, KEITH LEHRER, RICHARD TAYLOR It often happens that one does not do what he can do, and thus forfeits, through neglect, some end for which that act would have been the unique means. We describe a situation of this sort which, though perfectly commonplace, is such that our description entails the contradiction that the agent both can and cannot achieve the end in question. We exhibit the necessity of accepting a solution to this problem that overturns a presupposi tion of philosophy that is rarely doubted. For, we find it essential to reject the principle that, if an agent can perform an action that is a certain and unique means to some end, then the agent can achieve that end. In the case we describe, the agent cannot achieve his end even though he has suffi cient means.</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 407 Facts and Rudeness, ANNE LLOYD THOMAS MONIST Vol.49, No. 3: July, 1965 Law and Force, NORBERTO BOBBIO Punishment for Thoughts, HERBERT MORRIS The Acceptance of a Legal System, WILLIAM LEON McBRIDE This notion of acceptance is taken from Hart's Concept of Law, where, I show, it serves to reinstate the long-suppressed distinction between validity and effectiveness. Hart, however, has not explored the notion suffi ciently. "Acceptance" may mean a long-term dispositional attitude, or a single act of choice, or something in between. A factual and a normative question arise: (a) What sort of acceptance characterizes modern legal sys tems? (b) What attitude is desirable among officials and subjects of such systems? I show that acceptance even among a highly passive citizenry could not conform to a legal theory of extreme behaviorism, and, para doxically, that it is undesirable to encourage either total passivity (which would suppress what legal systems logically presuppose) or maximum choosing by subjects (which would destroy the law's value). This result is explicable, I maintain, if we question the alleged autonomy of legal sys tems, especially in the light of revolutionary situations, and reaffirm law's ultimate dependence on the broadly moral phenomena of responsibility and choice. The Expressive Function of Punishment, JOEL FEINBERG This paper argues that punishment, in the strict sense that interests the moralist, is distinguished from other (non-punitive) penalties by its reprobative symbolism. Punishment is more than mere "hard treatment"; rather it is hard treatment of a kind that expresses condemnation. It is the expressive function that enables punishment to perform its various symbolic roles: disavowal, non-acquiescence, vindication, and absolution. It also accounts for the distinction, so important in constitutional law, between regulative and punitive sanctions, and explains why some but not other forms of "strict liability" offend the sense of justice. Finally, the distinction between hard treatment and condemnation allows preservation of the plausible element in retributivism without commitment to its incoherences. It is incoherent to say that a certain amount of pain is required by a certain amount of wickedness; but it is sensible to claim that certain crimes deserve the condemnation that is expressed by punishment.</page><page sequence="16">408 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS On the Nature of Legal Deliberation, CLAUDE PREVOTS Edward H. Levi is taken to be claiming in An Introduction to Legal Reasoning that decisions in law courts are determined by a process of com paring cases to generate and apply implicit rules, rather than determined by appeal to the meaning of pre-established, comprehensive rules of a legal system. He maintains the ambiguity of concepts in established rules of law makes such concepts, as against reasoning by appeal to example, ineffectual in controlling the result of legal deliberation. His argument is held to be insufficiently warranted. The nature of legal deliberation is explored with reference to reasoning by appeal to example, and it is argued that such an appeal may be seen as an attempt to establish that two cases or sets of cases are of the same legal type. The Basis of Positive Law: An Essay toward the Advancement of "Inte grate Jurisprudence," JOHN UNDERWOOD LEWIS This paper makes an attempt at an initial integration of philosophy and legal theory. The integration is effected through the presentation of a fundamental theory of man-discovered law?that law which is charac terized formally by a justice which, as Ernest Barker says, "human authority expresses, or ought to express?but does not make. ..." In the presenta tion of the theory, three points are discussed: (1) it is shown how the notion of man-discovered law can be said truly to constitute a species of law. (2) Next, the reality of man-discovered law and man's purported knowledge of it are considered. (3) Finally, the relations between man-made and man-discovered laws, on the one hand, and man-discovered laws and moral precepts, on the other, are made explicit. Punishment, Justice, and the Separation of Issues, MILTON GOLDINGER This paper is a discussion of several interrelated factors that have lead to confusion in recent discussions of the moral justification of punishment. Since it is argued that the answers to various questions concerning punish ment (How is the general practice of punishment justified?, Who should be punished?, and How much should we punish?) are logically related, the claim that one question can be given a utilitarian answer while another is given a retributive one is rejected. The basis of the mistaken belief that these questions are logically separate is traced to the failure to understand properly the role of the concept of justice in various theories of punish ment. It is shown that the opposing concepts of justice that underlie the retributive and utilitarian positions result in definite and conflicting answers to the questions listed above. The Juridical Notion of Freedom as Seen through the law of Contract, MICHAEL REITER What is meant by saying that a person is not free to enter into a partic ular contract? In an effort to answer this question the author examines such legal concepts as a valid, void, voidable, illegal, and an unenforceable</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 409 contract. In so doing he concludes that traditional analyses of freedom in terms of restraints (punishment or prevention) upon one's behavior fail to account for legal prohibitions to contract, and hence, at least in this respect, are inadequate. Having established this, the author goes on to consider a more fruitful method for analyzing what is meant by a legal prohibition to contract and he concludes that we must differentiate purely legal relations from the physical and mental facts which call such relations into being. From this it becomes clear that it is not the physical and mental part of the relation that is voided when it is said that a person is not free to enter into such a contract, but instead it is the legal relationship that is declared void. Scientific Discovery and Legal Change, A. R. LOUCH Behavioral scientists, who claim to know the causes of crime, want their scientific know-how applied in the administration of criminal law, so that punishment will be replaced by therapy. But their alleged expertise turns out to be moral appraisal masquerading as scientific truth, giving to their testimony the illegitimate force of fact. Nor is the therapeutic method more humane: it treats the offender as an object to be manipulated accord ing to the interests of others, while imprisonment at least allows the offender a degree of moral autonomy and stresses reform less than the preservation, through penalties, of conditions of fair play in the social game temporarily upset by the infraction. The therapeutic aim would not implement but destroy the procedure of criminal law in a civil society. The Relation between Civil Law and Higher Law: A Study of Spinoza's Legal Philosophy, GAIL BELAIEF Spinoza's claim that civil law has a moral end is provisionally sub stantiated by an analysis of his notion of the function of law. The condi tions necessary for a law to be valid indicate that, although civil law must conform to the conditions embodied in the natural law of human beings, both just and unjust laws may be valid. Spinoza then attempts to justify evil laws by an appeal to their moral function as part of a valid legal system, but his principles allow the possi bility of an unjust legal system that has no value either in itself or in helping the state achieve the moral emendation of the individual. There is then in Spinoza's theory no intrinsic connection between civil law and the achievement of morality; although there is a necessary relation between civil law and natural law this relation does not guarantee material justice. THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. XV, No. 61: Oct., 1965 Truth: A Reconsideration of Austin's Views, P. F. STRAWSON Austin's 1950 dictum is reconsidered as an attempt to elucidate the notion of empirical statements other than those of unrestricted generality.</page><page sequence="18">410 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS After some preliminary amendments it is faulted on three major counts: 1) there is no such dichotomy of semantic conventions as is required by this dictum; 2) there is not, in general (as the dictum requires there be), for every statement, such a thing as the historical situation which the statement refers to and which can be specified independently of the truth value of the statement; 3) when the notion of conventional semantic cor relation is made fully explicit, the dictum is seen to be either circular or misleading. Synonymy, B. L. BLOSE The interpretation of synonymy as sameness of illocutionary-act potentials is surveyed and is defended against the charge of uninformative ness. Nevertheless, one grave flaw belonging to this interpretation, and indeed to any interpretation that makes synonymy hang on sameness of job-use, is identified: The job-use of the word "synonymous" itself is not in fact what it should be if the interpretation were correct: in other words, the interpretation is not reflexively consistent. This observed, an effort is made to discover a view of synonymy which is reflexively consistent. One interpretation that seems to hold promise is sketchily introduced, but no extended argument in its favor is offered. Degrees of Knowledge, GERSHON WEILER The aim of this paper is to re-state the problem of the title which has been neglected because analysis of knowing normally begins with "I know p entails 'p is true.' " As there are no degrees of truth it has been assumed that there are no degrees of knowledge either. This analysis links knowing p with understanding p. It is claimed that from there being degrees of understanding it is possible to give meaning to "degrees of knowledge." Moore's A Defence of Common Sense is criticized for its notion of correct analysis and it is argued that there is only partial analysis or partial under standing. Understanding here is not understanding the words only but the general context and truth conditions of p. In this sense, it is meaning ful to say that one knows p more or less, depending on understanding p more or less. Aristotle's Logic of Analogy, MARY HESSE The paper attempts to establish three points: 1) That at least one sense of what Aristotle called analogy is what is used and called by that name in modern scientific argument, and that his analysis throws some light on this; 2) That there is an essential continuity between Aristotle's "scientific" and "metaphysical" analogies, but that in metaphysical analogy he is forced to introduce it as an irreducible "third way" between univocity and equi vocity, which seems not to be required in scientific analogy; 3) That the way forward is to question, not the notion of analogy, but the notion of univocity, and that both scientific arguments and ordinary language employ analogy as the normal and not the exceptional case.</page><page sequence="19">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 411 Hobbes, Mechanism, and Egoism, BERNARD GERT My primary aim is to show that since psychological egoism is a theory about motives, Hobbes's mechanism cannot entail egoism. My article is divided into three sections. First I show that having a motive in doing an action entails having a belief which (a) you regard as your reason for doing the action, and which (b) provides an adequate explanation of your action. Second I show that there is no plausible interpretation of Hobbes's mech anism such that it entails that you have any belief which you regard as your reason for acting. Thus I show that Hobbes's mechanism cannot entail egoism. In the third section I generalize this conclusion and show that no causal explanation of human behavior can entail egoism. I show that unconscious motives should be regarded as more like causes than motives, and conclude that explanations in terms of unconscious motives also cannot entail egoism. PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Vol. LXXIV, No. 3: July, 1965 Wittgenstein on Privacy, JOHN W. COOK It is argued that Wittgenstein's treatment of the idea of a private language has been widely misunderstood because of a failure to recognize that he rejects not only the idea that we could invent names for private objects but also the very idea that there are such objects. Sections 246-254 of Philosophical Investigations are elaborated in an attempt to show that Wittgenstein, far from accepting the received view that sensations are essentially private, is exposing the false grammatical analogies that give rise to that view. It is also argued that it is no escape from these false analogies to say that it is logically impossibe to have (or feel) another person's sensa tions. Two current views about the nature of "logical impossibilities" are discussed, and both are found to be incoherent. Physicalism, THOMAS NAGEL (see p. 418). Descartes' Proof That His Essence Is Thinking, NORMAN MALCOLM Are True Numerical Statements Analytic or Synthetic?, ERIK STENIUS To find out for what number x the statement 7+ 5= # is true, we have to apply a certain procedure, called addition, to 7 and 5, and observe what number we obtain. Prima facie such a procedure has the character of an experiment; and that this is so, is an argument against the analyticity of (true) numerical statements. The author examines counter-arguments, as offered by Ayer; and he arrives at the conclusion that they show merely that it is analytically true that the result of an arithmetical calculation is unique. It follows that numerical statements can be interpreted as (essentially)</page><page sequence="20">412 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS singular, synthetic statements, which, being verified by one correct obser vation, are neither a priori, nor the result of inductive generalization. The author thinks, however, that a numerical statement can also be interpreted as analytic, and characterizes the relation between these two interpretations. PHILOSOPHY Vol. XL, No. 153: July, 1965 Locke as an Empiricist, DOUGLAS ODEGARD Although clearly an empiricist on the origin of ideas, Locke does not (a) confine experience to sense-experience, (b) treat reflection as representa tional, (c) claim merely that all meaning is empirical, (d) contend only that it is possible to experience the object of any idea, (e) view a non-empirical idea as self-contradictory, or (f) neglect ideas which "terminate" in exper ience. Locke is largely a rationalist regarding knowledge and truth. He insists that general knowledge must be non-empirical and confines empirical knowledge roughly to objects actually or immediately present to the mind. Even where he thinks knowledge impossible he feels reason has an impor tant role to play. He subscribes to a whole range of non-identical necessary truths in mathematics, ethics, natural philosophy, and metaphysics. And he for the most part refrains from reducing the knowledge of such truths to mere linguistic knowledge. Locke and the Intuitionist Theory of Number, RICHARD AARON, PHILIP WALTERS To what extent does Locke in the Essay, II. xvi foreshadow modern theories of number, particularly the intuitionist? Hey ting speaks of con ceiving the notion of an entity and adds: "We also recognise the possibility of an indefinite repetition of the conception of entities. " At first sight this is like Locke's account of number in II. xvi, 1 and 2. But if the matter be looked into further there are also big differences. Locke's account of 1 as a simple idea and all other natural numbers as simple modes (i.e., complex ideas) would not be acceptable to Heyting. Can Locke be said to have fore seen the principle of mathematical induction? The suggestion of it does seem to be present in Locke's chapter, but only in an ambiguous way. Berkeley and God, JONATHAN BENNETT Berkeley's theories raise questions about (a) objects' continuity through gaps in our perception of them; and (b) reality, which Berkeley defines in terms of the regularity and involuntariness of some of our "ideas," and not in terms of (a). He cared deeply about (b) and?the commen tators notwithstanding?hardly at all about (a). Only once, desultorily, does he argue from (a) to God's existence: other supposed presentations of that argument have simply been misunderstood by the commentators.</page><page sequence="21">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 413 Berkeley's ambiguous use of "independent," failure to grasp which has led students of him to muddle (a) with (b), is also the clue to two striking mistakes which Berkeley himself made. Berkeley's Impact on Scottish Philosophers, G. E. DAVIE Berkeley's philosophy was much discussed in Scotland a decade before Hume's Treatise was published. Berkeley corresponded with the Rankenian Society of Edinburgh which included Turnbull (who was Reid's teacher), Colin MacLaurin, and John Stevenson, appointed to the Edinburgh Logic Chair in 1730. Stevenson set his class essays on Berkeley, three of which survive, the earliest dating from 1737. PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. XXV, No. 4: July, 1965 And the Whithering Away of Social Philosophy, DONALD CLARK HODGES Four problems are raised in this essay: Why has social philosophy become impoverished? In what respects is it withering away? Does its dissolution contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the social sciences? What effect has its eclipse had upon the humanization or dehu manization of knowledge? Briefly, the following answers are offered: (1) social scientists have appropriated everything of scientific interest in social philosophy while philosophers have reduced it to a branch of logical and linguistic analysis; (2) social scientists have made philosophers super fluous as liaison agents between the social sciences, as analyzers of the generic traits of group life, as methodologists and social theorists; (3) the elimination of normative and metaphysical subject matter has contributed to increasing specialization of knowledge; and (4) social scientists have yet to develop a science of human wants or a concern for socially significant problems to take the place of now obsolete normative theories. John Dewey and Ancient Philosophies, JOHN P. ANTON Three aspects of Dewey's relationship to Greek philosophy are dis cussed: the polemical, which refers to his earlier rejection of the classical tradition as being incurably dualistic; the historico-critical, which focuses on his cultural relativism as the context for his more judicious assessment of philosophical movements; and the cumulative, which examines certain cen tral features Dewey shared with Plato and Aristotle and extended signif icantly. Dewey's development in approaching the Greeks is examined and his oversimplifications and assumptions exposed. On the whole, funda mental to any evaluation of Dewey's treatment of the Greeks is the fact that his critique of traditions in general is at once instrumentalist and romantic. Dewey acknowledged a deep affinity to Plato while for Aristotle he showed marked reprobation. The main reason for Dewey's limited insights into</page><page sequence="22">414 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Greek philosophy must be primarily attributed to his failure to extend to his historical accounts the same contextual analysis he considered central to his pragmatic methodology. Immediacy, Privacy, and Ineffability, RAMON M, LEMOS Since immediate experience is necessarily private to the person who has the experience, a question arises as to whether it is necessarily ineffable. To say that an experience is ineffable is to say either that it is indescribable, that it is inexpressible, or that it is incommunicable. Whether an experience is indescribable or not depends upon whether it is simple or unanalyzable, not upon whether it is immediate. Since some immediate experiences are simple and some are not, some are indescribable and some are not. Whether an experience is expressible or not never depends upon its intrinsic nature, but upon one's ability to talk. Therefore no immediate experience is intrinsically inexpressible. And since the communicability of an expe rience never depends upon its intrinsic nature, but upon the appropriateness and clarity of the language of the speaker and the experience and intelligence of the hearer, no immediate experience is intrinsically incommunicable. Three Logics, or the Possibility of the Improbable, PETER J. CAWS Pervasive Subjectivism, MARVIN F?RBER The various forms of subjectivism proceed from the Cogito, or acknowl edge its primacy. That allows for considerable ingenuity of operations, while insuring a basic relatedness in the outcome. The need to account for the world on that basis presents the most serious difficulty to pure sub jectivism. Covert or mixed forms of that philosophy face the same diffi culty in so far as the principle of subjectivity is assumed. Merleau-Ponty is of interest in this connection. The critical reaction that has developed has been due to the unresolved difficulties, as illustrated by Fink; but also to the many functions philosophy must perform. Artifactualism, JAMES K. FEIBLEMAN The two factors which played the largest role in human evolution were languages and material tools. The philosophical study of languages has been vigorously pursued by Wittgenstein and his followers, but the equally important philosophical study of material tools has been neglected. The humanization of the man-ape consisted in the process of externalization : learning to do outside the body what had formerly been done in it. This had the advantage of greater efficiency and it could be passed on to successive generations through a kind of learning inheritance. Tools accounted for the upright posture, with the freedom of the use of hands, and, in com bination with signs, for the incraese in cranial capacity. Civilized man lives in a world largely composed of material tools. He has altered every thing in his immediate environment. He has brought this development to the point where he is now a victim of it, for he responds to the stimuli of the artifacts with chain-learned behavior. The process of evolution should</page><page sequence="23">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 415 be accelerated rather than stopped by this development, but we do not yet know where it will take us. We shall not be on top of the problem until we have acquired the ability to plan tools in terms of the anticipated con ditioning to which they will subject us. Karl Mannheim and Contemporary Functionalism, THELMA Z. LAVINE Contemporary sociological functionalism stems from two distinct nine teenth century sources: (1) biologistic organicism (conventionally assumed to be the single source), utilized in the positivistic systems of Comte and Spencer; (2) the relatively unknown Romanticist-historicist concept of the unity and uniqueness of spirit of a social group, utilized in the dialectical, historicist, anti-positivist systems of Hegel and Marx. Mannheim is shown to derive from (2), and the historicist-Romanticist meanings he gives in the development of his thought to structure and function, the key words in the language of contemporary functionalism, are noted. Mannheim conse quently avoids certain difficulties of biologistic functionalism (e.g., with regard to needs, adaptation, structure-function symmetry) but takes on the metaphysical difficulties of Romanticism-historicism. He abstracted the same set of formal concepts as biologistic functionalism (structure, func tion, system, interdependence, equilibrium, disfunction) but his use of these concepts is for the most part historicist, evaluative, and diagnostic in sharp distinction from the formalistic neutralism which prevails in con temporary functionalism. The Concept of Mental Health, HENRY A. ALKER This article presents three standards for adjudicating current disputes about the terminology of mental health and mental disease. 1) Ontological adequacy: Acts and personality organization described in this terminology must be identifiable in terms of relevant contrasts with physical disease, malingering, etc. 2) Technical adequacy: Well-formed concepts must meet further appropriate tests when used in contexts of scientific explana tion. 3) Non-morality: Despite the understandable attractiveness of teleo logical concepts for use in a naturalistic ethic such considerations should not determine their justification in scientific contexts. Some difficulties in explicating and testing these concepts may be resolved when they are viewed as disjunctive rather than conjunctive concepts. This disjunctive character of the concepts leads to easy distortion of their meaning in moral contexts but may still be particularly relevant for their use in scientific theory construction. RATIO Vol. VII, No. 3: Dec, 1965 Reflections on Scepticism, Pyrrhonian and Other, G. RADNITZKY Pyrrhonian scepticism is used as a point of departure. Some major interpretations are discussed. (1) Theoretical scepticism such as the denial</page><page sequence="24">416 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS of the possibility of knowledge of the external world, of certain or absolute knowledge, of presuppositionless and holistic knowledge, of comprehensive knowledge organized in "Euclidean" form, of "metaphysical" (existential) knowledge. Certain versions of scepticism are criticized from the plat form of Popperian "Criticist or Rationalist tradition"; and, from the view point of the philosophy of science, it is suggested that the problem of truth may be replaced by the problem of explicating the judgment that this hypothesis is more correct than that. (2) Sceptical doctrines are con sidered in their pragmatic context, and attention is drawn to the affinity between certain sorts of scepticism and "Oxfordism." (3) Some psycholog ical comments on scepticism conclude the paper. Ethical Systems as Order Relations, T. I WAND This paper analyses the possibility of constructing an ethical system on the basis of individual preferences. Using the Arrow Possibility theorem, which has been used in the area of welfare economics, it is shown that, given "reasonable" restrictions upon the aggregation function, no consistent social ordering of choices can be obtained from the set of all individual preference profiles. Two somewhat more restrictive aggregation rules, in which either the range or the domain of the aggregation function is restricted, are then discussed. In general, it appears to be impossible to construct an ethical system in this manner. Consistency, Transitivity, and Inductive Support, WESLEY C. SALMON In order to provide a rationale for certain consistency requirements in inductive logic (regularity, linguistic invariance), this paper explores the ways in which inductive and deductive inferences may legitimately be com bined with each other. The investigation proceeds by examination, in the light of the theorem on total probability, of transitivity relations involving both deductive entailment and inductive support. Letting "A-+B" mean "A entails B" and "A=&gt;B" mean "A inductively supports B" we find that [(A=&gt;B) . (B-+C)]-(A=&gt;C) holds, while [(A-&gt;B) . (B=&gt;C)]-&gt;(A=&gt;C) does not hold. This apparently peculiar asymmetry is explained in terms of the requirement of total evidence. Berkeley and the Metaphor of Mental Subsistence, J. G. MURPHY From the time of Hume to the present day, Berkeley has often been ridiculed for lacking the wisdom to treat minds in a manner analogous to the way in which he treated physical objects. Physical objects are nothing but bundles of sense-data and similarly, so the criticism goes, minds ought simply to be regarded as bundles of perceptions. In fact, Berkeley explicitly considered and rejected such a reductionist view. To understand why he did, it is necessary to consider some of his often neglected views on human action. He believes that agency, a funda</page><page sequence="25">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 417 mental fact about persons, gives rise to a fundamental lack of parallelism be tween physical objects and persons. Thus the kind of reduction that will work for the one will not work for the other. He thus opts for a substance theory of the mind. In many ways, however, he is willing to admit that in talking of the mind as a substance he is speaking metaphorically. He thereby avoids being guilty of what Ryle has called the doctrine of the ghost in the machine. Facts, N. COLES In this paper it is argued that the familiar concept of a fact is the source of philosophical difficulties when it is used to answer two different questions: a) what makes a sentence true?, and b) to what does a sentence refer (So far from being identical, the answers to these two questions must necessarily be different). The author restricts the use of fact to the second case, i.e.. he holds that a fact is the reference of a sentence. He claims to show?against Frege?that the references of sentences cannot be truth values; and he defines the reference of a sentence as what it would be for the references of the parts of the sentence to be connected as the sentence says. Using this account of fact he then goes on to apply Frege's distinc tions between sense and reference to explain how the same facts can be known by observers with different concepts, or, more widely, how the same reality can be known by people with different outlooks on the world. He holds that this conclusion conflicts with some current views advanced by theorists in the social sciences. The Logic of Derivationist Versions of the Naturalistic Fallacy, J. F. LANGE Derivationist and Analyzability Versions of the Naturalistic Fallacy are distinguished, the latter being normally connected with the analysis of good, construed variously as a property, notion or linguistic entity, and the former being connected with the derivation of normative conclusions from non-normative premiss-sets. The "Naturalist's Dilemma" is presented, showing that, on one approach, involving the essentiality of predicates, it appears that either the premiss-set and conclusion are both normative or both non-normative; thus, either the Naturalist has not managed to do without a normative premiss-set or he has not managed to derive a nor mative conclusion. However, it is then shown that, as a matter of fact, the derivation of normative conclusions from non-normative premiss-sets is a logically trivial matter. It is concluded that Derivationist Versions mis represent the substance of the issue, which lies in the feasibility of Analyzability Versions. Two Theorems of Degree of Confirmation, A. E. MICHALOS Carnap has claimed that a necessary condition of adequacy for any explicatum of degree of confirmation is that the confirmation values yielded must be within those warranted by the given empirical and logical factors. It is shown that the two crucial theorems dealing witht universal hypotheses (viz., the theorems of instance and qualified-instance confirmation) violate this condition.</page><page sequence="26">418 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Logical Procedures and the Identity of Expressions, P. GEACH A logical procedure?e.g., negation, substitution, attaching predicate to subject?is to be conceived as a function whose arguments and values are expressions. This account requires a criterion of identity for expressions, so that we may, e.g., regard the proposition "Plato was bald" as not oc curring within the proposition "The philosopher whose most famous pupil was Plato was bald." Various other cases are discussed in which an expression's occurrence is only apparent; e.g., reason is given for denying that a proposition "An A is P and that same A is Q" contains as a part the corresponding proposition "An A is P" that can be inferred from it. Word-Magic and the Trivialization of Philosophy, J. W. N. WATKINS The article is a review of Morris Lazerowitz's Studies in Metaphilos ophy. On the Logic of Discovery, P. ALEXANDER The author discusses N. R. Hanson's contention in Patterns of Dis covery that there is a special kind of inference by means of which we arrive at scientific hypotheses. This inference is, allegedly, neither deductive nor inductive, but is, rather, close to Peirce's retroduction. Kepler's work on the orbit of Mars is used as an example. It is argued that Hanson's account is not clear and that he does not substantiate his claim for a special kind of inference because he fails to exhibit its form or pattern. Consequently, there are no grounds for calling it "inference." PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW July, 1965 Physicalism. THOMAS NAGEL The paper describes relatively undisturbing conditions from which it would follow that a person is nothing over and above his body. Certain standard objections to physicalism are answered, concerning the location, intentionality, and alleged privacy of mental events. The concept of identity employed in a statement of physicalism is investigated, and a revised version of Leibniz's law is suggested to cover transcategorial identities. This is applied to identities between events, states, conditions, etc., and in the description of various versions of the identity thesis. Finally, an attempt is made to explain the author's persistent unhappiness with physicalism, which remains even when the standard objections have been answered. This is done in terms of an ostensible distinction between the self as subject and any object as possessor of its attributes. Compelling as that view is, however, it argues equally against any account of the person as a substance in the world, and is therefore implausible as an argument for other theories of mind against physicalism.</page></plain_text>
