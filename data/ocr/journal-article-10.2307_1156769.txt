<plain_text><page sequence="1">[47] SOME OBSERVATIONS ON RELIGIOUS CULTS IN ASHANTI BARBARA E. WARD RECENT happenings in the Gold Coast, and particularly in Ashanti, have tended to focus interest upon the structure of the constitution and the struggle for political power. Ten years ago two other movements were attracting at least as much attention. In a preliminary report on the work of the Ashanti Social Survey, published in I948,' Fortes described these as first, an apparently insatiable demand for schools, and, second, an almost equally if not more powerful development of what he called ' new witch-finding cults '. That the demand for education of all kinds continues and is gradually being met is well known; it would be interesting, and perhaps, in the light of occurrences in other parts of Africa, significant to learn what has happened to the new cults. The novelty of these cults in the I940's may be assumed from the comparative absence of emphasis upon witchcraft in Ashanti in Rattray's works, written only a quarter of a century earlier.2 Rattray's whole approach to African society was through a study of beliefs in the supernatural and practices associated with them, and it is certain that he omitted little of significance, yet he mentions witchcraft only about half-a-dozen times. I myself had conversations with elderly Ashanti who declared that there never used to be so many witches in the good old days, a statement which might have meant little had it not been supported by the testimony of some of the younger people, who said that witchcraft was a matter on which their elders could not usually help them. It was often stated, too, that the old gods of Ashanti did not provide protection against witchcraft. Moreover, in almost every Ashanti town or village in the forties there could be found one or more cult places of recent origin, usually not more than two or three years old, the main function of which was the apprehension and purification of witches. Thus it appears that in Ashanti ten years ago increased European contact, an extension of social scale, rapid economic advance, political change, and the spread of Christianity and school education had been ac- companied not simply by the persistence of witchcraft beliefs but by their very consi- derable increase, and by the emergence of new cults designed to deal with them.3 In the forties Ashanti was, as it still is, an administrative province of the Gold Coast. The major part of it covered with rain forest, thinning out into savannah in the north, Ashanti contained about one-half to three-quarters of a million Sudanese I Human Problems in British Central Africa, vi, 2 R.

These people were farmers and traders and some of them were craftsmen. The food-farming was largely in the hands of women, who were responsible also for most of the petty trade in foodstuffs. Some of these women had quite large-scale businesses, but most of the long-distance trade was in the hands of men whose main item of export was cocoa. A currency system, in gold-dust and cowries, had existed well before the British conquest, and the complicated organization of middlemen in the cocoa-trade is said to have been a direct development from that used in the slave-trade in the past. Probably nearly every adult man, and many a woman too, had his own cocoa patch, which he worked either by himself with the help of his own family or with hired immigrant (i.e. non-Ashanti) labour, usually from the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast or from French territory.' There were very considerable differences in income, from that of the small man who owned perhaps half an acre of cocoa which he sold to his next-door neighbour, to those of the big dealers in Kumasi, the capital, who might be employed directly by the European exporting companies, or who might be independent buyers dealing in thousands of pounds annually. The notions of price and profit and of the benefits, social and political, to be obtained by economic advance, which were well understood in the nineteenth century, have been even more widely and completely assimilated since the introduction of cocoa in the i89o's.2 In return for their cocoa, Ashanti hope to satisfy their ever expanding wants-for kerosene, tinned foodstuffs of all kinds, cloth, tools, cosmetics, furniture, bicycles, cars, in fact for all kinds of manufactured goods and for services such as broadcasting, train, lorry and taxi transport (an article in The Times in I950 stated that there were then more than 500 licensed taxis in Kumasi), for medical services and, above all, for schools. The I920's and the post-war years were the boom periods; in the 1930's the price of cocoa was halved, and then dropped even lower; during the war imports were drastically restricted. After the war prices rose again and remained high, but disease threatened the trees and the only cure then known, which was cutting out, appeared to most of the farmers as an even greater threat, while, at that time of rising prices, the Government's setting up of a Cocoa Marketing Board which fixed the price to be paid to the growers each year, was looked upon with very considerable mistrust. Cocoa, then, brought a very marked acceleration of economic change and a greater dependence upon forces over which the Ashanti themselves had no control, and indeed of the nature of which they were usually entirely ignorant. Nearer home it also brought changes which were not incomprehensible or, in theory, uncontrol- lable, but which were none the less disturbing and often uncontrolled. These changes were felt in the kinship organization, and reacted, therefore, upon the personal life of individuals at almost every step. The Ashanti kinship system is matrilineal.

Clan membership carries with it the obligation to marry outside the clan and to give hospitality to fellow members. The corporate kin-groups are localized matrilineages, of varying generation depth, each under a male lineage head who is responsible for maintaining ritual relations with deceased predecessors, for settling intra-lineage disputes, for representing lineage members in inter-lineage disputes, and so forth. It is in him also that the lineage land is vested. Lineage land is available to all lineage members, provided that no one infringes the rights of anyone else. It is claimed by right of first occupation, and it may be extended by further clearing, for newly cleared land is at the disposal of its clearer until his death, but if he dies intestate it falls to the lineage. Lineage land itself is thus never really ' inherited ', it simply re- mains lineage property (to use an English analogy it is land ' in mortmain '). Indivi- duals have rights to the usufruct of certain patches. Such an arrangement is perfectly easy to work so long as the crops are annuals, and so long as the population remains fairly immobile. But cocoa is a tree crop and the trees may continue to bear for 20-30 years. In fact, cocoa has usually been planted on newly cleared land, which, as we have seen, remains the personal property of the clearer during his lifetime. Fortes and other observers have reported an increasing tendency for cocoa-farmers to give their cocoa-farms away, as they have every right to do, as gifts during their lifetime, or to dispose of them after death by will, which by the 1940's was becoming more and more common. Cocoa-farms thus treated do not become lineage property and, as cocoa is the chief economic asset of Ashanti and the major individual interest, lineage solidarity and the authority of the lineage head are thus undermined. This tendency towards the individual control of the most economically important land was already apparent ten years ago. By that time, too, cocoa had also been responsible for increasing mobility. Many Ashanti had left their own home villages to settle in hitherto largely uninhabited areas for the purpose of growing cocoa, and were thus freer of lineage control than they would have been in the past. Mobility was further increased by the opening up of railways and roads for the sake of the cocoa-trade. By the mid-thirties the Ashanti had become a travelling people, and so had others, in particular labourers from the Northern Territories. There was a new mingling of customs which, though it probably had little direct effect upon the Ashanti kinship system, was nevertheless likely to stimulate discussion and did have other direct effects as we shall see. In some places, especially in the new cocoa districts, over-planting of cocoa led to an increased dependence on the market for foodstuffs and a consequent loosening of the bonds created by the joint labour of related food-farmers and by mutual help. But cocoa was only one influence in the undermining of the ' family system', as the Ashanti lineage organization was commonly called. The influence of English law and English example is against matriliny, and the influence of Christianity against ancestor worship. Thus not only was the large ' family system' attacked, but the principle of matriliny itself became debatable-at times quite literally, for in many an Evening Institute and Literary Society in Ashanti the topic of' Avuncular versus Paternal Inheritance ' has been argued over and over again. In the forties the Ashanti Confederacy Council actually modified the strict rules of matrilineal inheritance in cases of intestacy. Whatever the outcome-and it is certainly possible that Gold Coast E 49</page><page sequence="4">50 SOME OBSERVATIONS ON RELIGIOUS CULTS IN ASHANTI nationalism may swing the balance back in favour of matriliny-the situation in the I940's was one of uncertainty and frequently of dissatisfaction in kinship relations. Examples of the probable effect of this changing kinship situation are given below, but to complete this rapid survey of the general social situation in Ashanti let us turn now to a consideration of the political organization. This has undergone drastic changes during the last fifty years. Ashanti was, in the nineteenth century, one of the most famed West African military powers whose armies defeated British forces no less than seven times before the Ashanti Confederacy was destroyed and the King of Ashanti (the Asantehene), with most of his entourage, was deported to the Seychelles. Even then a further military expedition was necessary before the country was finally subdued in the year o00. Ashanti remain very conscious of their past military glory. The exiled Asantehene was permitted to return to Kumasi in 1924, and the Con- federacy was formally restored under his successor, the present Asantehene, in 1935, but there is no doubt that the thirty-five years during which there was no central Ashanti authority increased the always considerable political independence of the constituent states, and gave opportunities for lesser chiefs to attain positions which traditionally did not belong to them. The restoration of 193 5 was welcomed probably wholeheartedly by rank and file Ashanti who saw in it the return of past glories and spiritual protection, but it was by no means entirely to the taste of all the chiefs, and the past twenty years have seen more than one instance of attempted rebellion. This in itself would be enough to indicate the unsettled state of Ashanti politics, but added to it was the usual Colonial sequence of the undermining and the sub- sequent directing into new channels of the power of the' Natural Rulers ', supported by the British Administration. The Asantehene, and under him those chiefs who were recognized as members of the Confederacy Council, were in the forties the Native Authorities for Ashanti. The difficulties of a modern chief's position have been most fully described by Busia' and require no further elaboration here. Present-day develop- ments have made the situation even more unsettled and the ordinary people more acutely aware of it. This necessarily rapid survey makes it sufficiently clear that the situation in modern Ashanti is such that individuals are bound to feel, almost continually, some form of anxiety-in economic life, in kinship relations, in politics. Moreover no reference has been made to such things as the new developments in mining, with the consequent concentrations of population, overcrowding, and the incidence of tuberculosis and venereal disease, nor have I mentioned the direct effects of the war. Any student of society would expect to find, in such a situation, a considerable recourse to the supernatural for reassurance and the establishment of confidence and for the explana- tion of failures and unpredictable occurrences. We have already seen that there was such a movement in the 1940's; it took the form of new witch-finding cults, and Fortes regarded these as one of the major methods of attempting to achieve adjustment and adaptation to the continual changes and chances of modern Ashanti-the other being the demand for school education which was also expected to bring knowledge and power. If we ask why new cults arose there is little difficulty in showing that the old cults could not have met the situation. In the first place, the situation was unprecedented I K. A. Busia, The Position of the Chief in the Modern Political System of Ashanti, London, 95 I .</page><page sequence="5">SOME OBSERVATIONS ON RELIGIOUS CULTS IN ASHANTI and the old cults were apparently too rigid for adaptation. Ashanti statements that the old gods did not know how to deal with witchcraft have already been referred to. In the second place, this lack of adaptability is largely to be accounted for by the close association of the old gods and beliefs with the traditional social structure, so that the old cults could not fully survive the disintegration of that structure. The old cults were of three kinds: the cults of the royal ancestors, that is of the predecessors of each of the chiefs and of the Asantehene himself, were essentially expressions and re- inforcements of political solidarity; the cults of the lineage ancestors were similarly connected with lineage solidarity; for individual aspiration and protection there was the cult of the patrilineally inherited soul substance (ntoro) which was connected with the worship of certain gods of the main rivers and the one lake in Ashanti, and there was also the worship of the so-called 'sky-god ', Nyame, and the propitiation of Mother Earth, Asase Yaa. Although distinct from the cults of the royal ancestors, the ntoro gods were closely connected with the state cults, both through the chief's own personal ntoro and because he represented his people in worshipping them at certain festivals. The third reason for the declining influence of the old cults is to be found in the direct attack made upon them and some of the practices associated with them by Christian missions and by Government. One might ask whether Christianity itself could not provide modern Ashanti with the sense of security which neither the secular world nor the traditional religion could give. There is no straightforward answer to this question. For some individuals it appears that Christianity in one or other of its forms did provide adequate explana- tions of the universe and of day-to-day events and give satisfying peace of mind. But Christianity did not by any means reach everyone and, even among the evangelized, those who were completely satisfied by it were probably very few indeed. It is not difficult to guess why this should have been so; we have seen that the main needs of individuals were explanations of and justifications for the otherwise inexplicable vagaries of disease and economic forces, changing and often unsatisfactory family relations, and political uncertainty. The Christian explanations of economic failure or sudden illness are seldom wholly satisfying, Christian guidance on family relations is often hardly relevant to the Ashanti situation,' and in political affairs Christianity suffers from being the Europeans' religion. In the traditional structure the function of religion in providing an expression and reinforcement of social solidarity was of very great importance. Indeed, in so far as the traditional order was more stable and individual anxieties therefore less pro- nounced, it is likely that this, the sociological, function of religion was predominant in the past. It is still important today, but once again Christianity can scarcely be expected to meet the need. Attempts are certainly made to use Christian festivals for the expression of kin-group and political solidarity. Even before the war Christmas day had become almost a lineage festival; on New Year's day Christian chiefs paraded to church with all the panoply of ancient chiefly splendour. But, partly because Christianity did not reach all the people, partly because, for the reasons 2 Missionaries preach monogamy and the virtues traditionally simply a contract between two lineages, of the Western type of simple family unit.

Thus in the face of the inapplicability of Christianity and the decay of the old cults one need not be surprised to find new cults arising. A visitor to almost any Ashanti settlement in the late i940's would probably have found that there was at least one such cult in full swing. Church or chapel was attended, the ritual of the 42-day cycle of the royal ancestor cult was still performed, but the new cults usually drew the biggest congregations. Two questions then arise: how far did these new cults actually meet the religious needs of contemporary Ashanti, and why did the cults take the form they did? That these cults did not provide all the answers was obvious from the fact that Christian churches continued to attract large congregations, and from the universal faith in the power of school education. Nevertheless a brief examination of one or two of the new cults shows at once their many-sided appeal. The following description of the general picture as I saw it myself is illustrated by material very kindly collected for me by the Rev. S. Ackesson in 1946. For the spiritual power which is believed to be the centre of each cult I have used the term ' fetish', since that is the common English term used in everyday parlance in the Gold Coast, though' medicine 'would be a more exact translation of the Twi word aduro. There is one further point: to describe these cults merely as ' witch-finding cults ' is to limit their scope somewhat misleadingly. No informant was at all clear as to his own notions of witchcraft, sorcery, spirit-possession, healing, or any other religious concept; indeed, it was already apparent that few, if any, had ever attempted to conceptualize their beliefs before being questioned. The cult performances themselves included all these phenomena, but it was the witch-finding aspect which seemed to predominate, both in frequency of performance and in the minds of informants. In 1946 the cult place of the small village of A-, not far from Kumasi, was just outside the settlement in a clearing in the forest. It consisted of a sanded rectangular space, almost square, about the size of two tennis-courts. On one side of the sanded floor was a small shrine of whitewashed 'swish' topped with thatch, the whole about z2 feet high and 3? feet long. Behind the shrine was a midden heap. An adjacent side of the floor was flanked by a thatched shelter, the other two were bare. The fetish to whom the shrine belonged was called Kune, often referred to as ' he ', but apparently envisaged only in the vaguest anthropomorphic terms. Kune, like all the other new fetishes of which I have knowledge, came from outside Ashanti, in this case from the Northern Territories, and was served by a priest dressed in Northern costume and following a Northern ritual of slaughtering small fowls which is described by Fortes as common in the ordinary ancestral and Earth cults of the Tallensi, for example.2 This priest was attended by four priestesses, the chief of whom was his classificatory sister; two others were cousins on the father's side; the fourth was no relation. All these people could suffer possession, when, as the people said, 'the The dominant Christian Church in Ashanti is the Presbyterian. 2 See note, p. 5 9 below.</page><page sequence="7">SOME OBSERVATIONS ON RELIGIOUS CULTS IN ASHANTI powers came upon them '. The fetish had been brought to the village only about eighteen months before by one X. Y., the maternal uncle of the priest, a lorry-driver and cocoa-farmer, prosperous by the standards of that village and a forceful per- sonality, but with as yet no place in the traditional hierarchy of village leadership; he was about 35-40 years old. He described how he had had a series of mysterious illnesses and a general run of bad luck which had culminated nearly two years ago in an accident with his lorry-an expensive as well as a painful experience. On the advice of a Northern Territories man who was labouring for him on his cocoa-farm he had set out for the Northern Territories to try to gain spiritual protection and salvation from his bad fortune from this man's local Earth spirit, Kune. He then told how he had decided that the whole village ought to be given the opportunity of benefiting from this source of power, for he declared that Kune had told him through his priest that the lorry accident had been caused by witchcraft, and obviously, therefore, there were witches abroad and the village needed protection. It was true that there were other new fetishes in neighbouring villages to whom application could be made, but it was a nuisance to have to travel to them, and anyway A- was an important village (just look at its new school-indeed an impressive sight) and ought to have a fetish of its own. Accordingly he ' bought some of the medicine ' from the Northern Territories priest and brought it home, setting up a small shrine in the clearing just outside the village. He then sent his nephew, a classificatory sister's son, to the Northern Territories to learn the proper ritual. By the middle of 1946 Kune was beginning to grow famous, not only in his own village, but in neighbouring settle- ments too. Anyone could become a cult member, or a ' member of the fetish ', as it was called, by paying a small sum, taking a ritual bite or two of kola, and undertaking to obey the fetish rules. Of these rules I obtained no complete list, but they comprised mainly such precepts as 'Do not commit adultery', 'Do not swear against thy neighbour', 'Do not steal', 'Do not harbour evil thoughts against anyone ', and so forth, and an injunction to serve no other fetish but to rely solely upon Kune. Membership of the fetish was sought for protection against witchcraft and sorcery, particularly by barren women or those whose children were continually sick or dying, by impotent men, by anyone sick of an apparently incurable disease,I by those who had any reason to fear economic failure or failure in examinations, all of which misfortunes, as well as most others, are ascribed to the evil intentions of others. The picture is a common one, and the anxiety-allaying function o,f the fetish in the face of economic trouble and sickness is clear, as is the explanatory function of the notions of witch- craft and sorcery here.2 To a social anthropologist, however, the most interesting aspects of the cult are those which can be associated with structural change. The working out of kinship tensions through the new cults, usually in connexion with an accusation3 of witch- craft or sorcery or of breaking the fetish rules, can be illustrated by many case I For an interesting example of faith in the the effects of increased economic dependence upon fetish power over tuberculosis, see 'An Ashanti a single crop.

I was caught by this fetish (Kune) because I said that it could not catch me even if I practised witchcraft. I did not really believe that it could catch me and so I flew in the night to visit my great-grand-daughter (number 20)."' The details of flying by night, ' spiritual sharing' and ' eating' a body, walking- sticks that are ' really ' snakes, the ' spiritual removal' of certain internal organs, are familiar items of West African witch beliefs. What is interesting here is that we see a clear case of the non-fulfilment of expected kinship obligations followed by resent- ment and subsequent feelings of guilt. For reasons already stated the evasion of kin- ship responsibilities was probably much less common in the traditional order, and thus the initial situation of resentment and then of anxiety on account of the resent- ment, which is not a proper sentiment to hold about one's kin, was probably much less likely to arise. The hypothesis that the increase in witchcraft is partly to be ascribed to an increase in intra-lineage tensions is also suggested by the opinion which was widely, though not I think universally, held in Ashanti ten years ago, that a witch could only harm a member of his or her own matrilineage.I Tensions between non-kin undoubtedly existed, but these were often expressed through belief in sorcery,2 or by enlisting the aid of a witch member of one's enemy's lineage. A confession of witchcraft relieves much of the tension in the self-accused witch and, as confessions are public, also gives an outlet for general aggressive feelings against powerful and incomprehensible evil. It seems, however, that in Ashanti in the I940's aggression was usually directed at the witchcraft rather than the witch. Once confession had been made and accepted by the fetish, the witch was received back into society without more than a fine and perhaps a minor physical punishment (penance). I attended a few of these public confessions. They were dramatic and intensely moving experiences even for a non-Twi-speaking outsider. The sanded floor of the fetish place would be surrounded by almost the whole population of the village, drummers (men) and singers (women) were gathered under the thatched shelter and everybody else was grouped along the two open sides of the square. Standing before the shrine was the fetish priest, waiting for the supplicant to speak. Meanwhile drumming and singing continued ceaselessly, and the priestesses danced in the sand. All this was in the heat of the afternoon. Confession was made through the fetish priest, who prompted and questioned the supplicant at intervals. The audience listened intently to each phrase, and in each pause broke into a kind of chanted prayer, beseeching the fetish to accept the confession. Acceptance was put to the test of sacrifice; when the supplicant indicated that there was no more to be said the fetish priest took a small fowl, slit its throat with a neat movement and threw it out on to the sand in front of the shrine. It fluttered and jerked, perhaps for half a minute, and then This is one of the reasons given for the usually witchcraft and sorcery drawn by Professor Evans- accepted immunity of Europeans.

I use here the distinction between 55</page><page sequence="10">56 SOME OBSERVATIONS ON RELIGIOUS CULTS IN ASHANTI lay still. If it finally died on its back with its feet in the air, that was a sign that the fetish accepted the confession. If it lay in any other position the confession was deemed incomplete, the supplicant was questioned further and urged to omit nothing. Sometimes as many as a dozen fowls might be sacrificed before one of them died the right way up. On one occasion, when I was watching, there were two supplicants, one a young woman who had already on a previous occasion sacrificed several fowls unavailingly, the other a man. The girl confessed to several small sins, but two fowls still died the wrong way up and she was led away. The man's case provoked more interest from the audience. Seven times a fowl was killed. Between each sacrifice he was urged to clear his heart of all the evil he had done, but seven times the fowls died on their breasts. So far his confessions had taken more than an hour. It was very hot. The crowd was very dense, the atmosphere extremely tense. The drumming and singing, which had scarcely been interrupted all afternoon, suddenly stopped and in deep silence the priest was heard exhorting the man to remember his sins. He could think of nothing more. But the fetish was clearly unappeased; there must be some- thing more; the singers fell upon their knees, beseeching the man to hold nothing back. Again he could think of nothing to say. Finally he mentioned that he had had the effrontery to wear an amulet, a charm in no way connected with the fetish Kune. To do this was to break one of the most important fetish rules; perhaps this was the trouble. For the eighth sacrifice no small chicken, but a large brown cockerel was produced, and with considerable ceremony its throat was cut. The tension in the audience was palpable. The singers dropped forward from their knees to their faces, knocking their foreheads on the ground, and the thick silence was broken by their prayers to the fetish to accept this confession. The cockerel was a tough one, and took some time to die. Several times it settled on the sand face downwards only to jerk up again and flutter round once more. After perhaps three-quarters of a minute, it might have been more, its back hit the dust and its feet clutched the air. On the instant the priest whisked it away over the top of the shrine to join the others on the midden heap with the vultures; it was given no chance to move again. The sacrifice had been accepted, and the man was absolved. The release of tension came like a flood. The singers leapt to their feet and burst into song, the drummers played as never before, the whole audience, Europeans included, broke into delighted clapping, looking round to one another smiling their relief and pleasure. The man himself turned in a moment from an abject, sweating, grey-visaged beggar into a swaggering, smiling dancer. Seldom, if ever, have I myself suffered a more dramatic experience. It is obvious that there was here a very strong agent for the resolution of inter- personal tensions. I regret that I have not enough material to follow up individual or lineage histories in this connexion. Was the ' absolution' of the witch, sorcerer or breaker of the fetish tabu a permanent one, or did he or she relapse into further neurotic anxieties? Was his reintegration into society complete, or was there some lingering mistrust of a self-accused miscreant? Complete case studies are required. The tense, dramatic quality of the cult performances, and the sudden flood of shared release which followed their successful completion, undoubtedly provided the ingredients for the development of strong bonds of group cohesion. One might expect, therefore, to find these cults providing, at least in part, a socially integrating factor which the old cults, as we have seen, were failing to provide. The need for</page><page sequence="11">SOME OBSERVATIONS ON RELIGIOUS CULTS IN ASHANTI social integration is a need of the individual as well as of the group, and there is no guarantee (especially in a rapidly changing society) that the groups served in this way by a particular cult will be identical with the groups which emerge in other social contexts. Cult practices do not necessarily reinforce social bonds of all kinds, though it is likely that in a predominantly non-literate society with limited transport, where nearly all relationships overlap, they will tend to do so. Unfortunately I have no full information concerning the connexion between these new Ashanti cults and the contemporary factors of faction and rivalry. In the article already quoted Fortes stated that the cults stood to some extent above political faction, but rivalry with neigh- bouring villages was implied in X. Y.'s description of why the village of A- de- served a fetish of its own. At the same time there is some evidence that contemporary groups, kinship and political, were tending to coalesce around different fetish cults, thus ' cashing in ', as it were, upon this source of cohesive power. Members of the same kin-group tended to join the same fetish, and fission in the kin-group tended to be accompanied by a change of fetish allegiance. In the political sphere there are two interesting examples from settlements of different sizes. In one, a near neighbour of A- and about the same size, there took place what might be described as a ' socialization ' of the fetish, which was taken over by the political authorities and then run for the village as a whole by the headman and his elders. The second example is from a much larger settlement, a town of some 4,000 people and the capital of a minor chiefdom. In 1945 there were at least four different fetishes in this town, one of which fairly soon began to attract a larger clientele than any of the others. By mid- 946 this fetish was by far the most important. When I first visited the chief in August I945 he expressed scorn at the very idea of these fetish cults. He was a man with a Standard VII education and a churchgoer, so his scorn may have been partly assumed for the benefit of the European teacher, but none the less it was firmly expressed. In April 1946 I again visited the town and was present at a very fully attended ceremony of healing conducted at the shrine of the most popular fetish. The chief sent several bottles of gin as an official gift to the fetish. Six months later I heard from an Achimota student, then staying in the town, that at a still more widely attended ceremony held for the same fetish the chief had not only been present, but had taken a leading part and joined in the dancing. A further point of interest is that on my visit in January I had noticed an ancient woman sitting near the fetish shrine (in this case a large silk-cotton tree draped with white cloth). On inquiry I was told that she was a priestess of Tano, one of the old gods. It was perhaps not without significance that this representative of what strength remained in the old cults should appear together with representatives of the existing political authority at a ceremony of the powerful new fetish. That any single new fetish would rise to be the central spiritually integrating factor in Ashanti as a whole seemed ten years ago to be very doubtful, both because of the complexities of this stratified society and because of the still strong appeal of the Golden Stool, which held a position in public esteem immeasurably above that of the lesser chiefly cults. There was, however, one very famous fetish at Kankamia near Kumasi which was visited by Ashanti from all parts as well as by a stream of pilgrims from all over the southern Gold Coast. The new political developments in the Gold Coast have in all likelihood had a 57</page><page sequence="12">58 SOME OBSERVATIONS ON RELIGIOUS CULTS IN ASHANTI profound effect upon the cults. Do they still exist ?' Have they had any influence upon political affairs ? Has the recent demand for a federal constitution and the resurgence of the Ashanti Confederacy under the Asantehene been accompanied by the emer- gence of any one ' pan-Ashanti ' cult ? There is one sphere at least in which the new political situation is likely to have had a marked effect. The earlier discussion of the political situation in the 1940's omitted any reference to the lack of opportunities for leadership open to the so-called ' youngmen ', that is the large numbers of men of 3-5 o years of age who, although at the height of their powers as individuals, did not as a rule have any place of authority in the contemporary power structure. Traditionally they had been warriors, the potential leaders among them no doubt officers and organizers, and as a group their political position had been recognized. In doing away with the traditional military organization the British had also, and deliberately, destroyed the political role of the ' youngmen's ' organizations (asafo). Nothing appeared to take their place. By the 1940's the ' youngmen ' were becoming increasingly restless, for they were fast losing sympathy with a mutilated traditional order which not only did not recognize them but also failed to cope adequately with the changing modern world. Go-ahead and exuberant 'youngmen' have probably now found a measure of satisfaction through the development of representative government, with the new party organizations and the great increase of political consciousness that have come with it. In the mid-forties all this was still in the future. It seems likely that in 1945 the desire to take a leading place was certainly among the motives impelling X. Y. of the village of A- to set up his shrine to Kune. Leadership in the cult brought prestige and considerable self-importance. Although not a lineage head, X. Y.lwas now called in for consultation in important village matters, and indeed took a leading part, as his forceful personality demanded, in such things as the planning of the new school and the levying of a local cocoa tax to pay for it. Fetish ownership also brought money, for new members all paid an entrance fee and confessed witches, sorcerers and transgressors paid varying amounts as fines. X. Y. kept elaborate accounts of the proceeds from his fetish, and paid out small sums to the minor priestesses. In the nearby village where the ' socialization' of the fetish already described took place, the financial side was certainly important. Mr. Ackesson wrote: 'When the headman and his elders saw that the three men [who owned the fetish] were making money, they decided to take over the fetish from them. The three men agreed on condition that their expenses would be paid. The headman and the elders agreed to this and the following conditions were made: (i) That after the expenses had been cleared any amount realised should be divided into three parts, one for the three original owners, one for the stool (i.e. the village) and one to be set aside as a reserve fund. (2) That the third which would belong to the stool should be used in purchasing a transport lorry, or a house in Kumasi, and that any amounts which might be realised from either of these things should be used to improve the village. These terms were agreed upon, and at present2 the village owns a Chevrolet lorry, which is driven by K. F., a youngman from the village, and two others, also from the village, act as mates.' I Certain Gold Coast fetish cults of similar type to those described here were proscribed by the Government during the 1940's. 2 947.</page><page sequence="13">SOME OBSERVATIONS ON RELIGIOUS CULTS IN ASHANTI 59 No one was ashamed of this profiteering, and it is certain that a man like X. Y., for instance, was not a hypocrite; he himself believed in his fetish-had it not cured him and set him on the road to prosperity?-and, as a sixth form student at Achimota once put it: ' After all, bishops and clergymen are paid for their jobs too.' Whatever the ethics of the matter (and many fetish clients complain bitterly of the charges and even fall into considerable debt over them) it is clear that the financial advantage of owning a fetish was largely responsible for the persistence and spread of the cults. The cults survived and spread not only because they fulfilled an important social function which no other ritual organization at the time fulfilled, but also because their elaborate structure, their entertainment value and the considerable financial interests involved had a momentum of their own. The second of the two questions posed earlier in this paper asked why these new Ashanti cults took the form they did. It has already been suggested that the Christian churches did not attract and hold large numbers because they did not provide enough exciting participant activity for their congregations, and they also failed to utilize already existing and accepted religious techniques. Audience participa- tion at a witch confession or a healing ceremony was very marked, particularly for women, whose exclusion from active part in the rituals of most Christian churches is equally marked. Singing and above all dancing, and what one might call choral prayer, all had their place in the cult practices. Moreover, spirit possession, regarded as devilish by the churches, was encouraged and revered. These were all old phenomena, techniques of the Ashanti cults in the past. The newer phenomena, the eating of kola nuts, the slaughtering of fowls, the Northern Territories dress and terms, and the details of witch beliefs, are easily explicable in the light of twentieth- century Gold Coast mobility. Witches had been familiar to the Ga and other coastal people for long; in the forties men from the Northern Territories had become common in Ashanti as labourers, but they were still somewhat strange, rather sinister; they appeared, I was told, to sit around doing nothing, yet they always had enough to eat, and they had curious customs-obviously their spirits must have been powerful. And so these spirits were adopted and through adoption became changed almost beyond recognition.' In attempting to give a general picture of the cult practices in Ashanti in the forties I am aware that I have failed to give enough attention to any one aspect. A complete answer to the two questions posed above would require more detailed information than I possess, and a much more systematic analysis than I have attempted. One particularly interesting problem which has not been touched upon is that of the attitudes and opinions of the educated minority and the more or less convinced Christians in Ashanti. There appears to be very little consciousness of inconsistency or conflict between either Western education or Christianity (which in Africa tend to be considered synonymous) and continued belief in witchcraft and in the efficacy of the fetish cults. Here was simply something 'different', something essentially 'African ', which European education and Christianity did not cater for. Perhaps African pride played a part too. In my admittedly brief2 experience I only met one I For a description of the Northern Territories I945, and 'Ritual Cycles and Social Cohesion in the religion in its native background see M.

The majority of people in any society are probably not religious enough by temperament or logical enough by training to be affected even by wide inconsistencies of belief: explanations are undoubtedly craved for, but once acquired they need not fit together. On the other hand there may well be much more emotional malaise on this score than most European teachers are aware of-certainly Dr. M. J. Field,' who worked at Achimota much longer than I, and made meticulous studies of witchcraft beliefs in the southern part of the Gold Coast, thinks so. Without any doubt there are widespread problems of neurosis con- nected with witchcraft confessions which deserve psychological study. No explanation of social developments can be single or simple. In a changing situation religious change will have a twofold aspect: psychological and sociological. One can expect adjustments to be made in the sphere of explanations of the universe, and vis-a-vis new and uncontrollable insecurities; one can also expect change, decay, and new growth, due to structural change, especially if, as in nearly all the simpler societies, religious beliefs and practices have in the past been closely integrated with the social structure. If neither the traditional forms of religious belief nor the newly introduced proselytizing forms of an alien religion (Christian or Islamic, for example) can meet these demands for adjustment, then one can expect the development of other types of religious organization-separatist churches, new or aberrant cults and so forth. It may be that the universalistic religions, with their single all-powerful but seemingly remote deities, often seem incapable of meeting the requirements of individuals who feel themselves in need of reassurance in the happenings of every- day life. So old ritual practices are retained, or, where these are not suited to the new situations, new ones are evolved. But such new developments can never be entirely without local precedent. They are bound to make use of previously existing practices, and even though they may adopt alien forms, the origin of these will not be hard to trace and their adaptation to local usage will be fairly obvious. It appears that something of this sort was happening in Ashanti ten years ago. Analogous movements in other parts of the world, from Kenya to New Guinea, spring at once to mind. 1 M. J.

Resume QUELQUES REMARQUES SUR DES CULTES RELIGIEUX EN ACHANTI Au cours des dix dernieres annees, la naissance et l'influence croissante de cultes religieux nouveaux, parmi les Achantis, ont ete constatees. Quelques-uns de ces cultes se concentrent</page><page sequence="15">SOME OBSERVATIONS ON RELIGIOUS CULTS IN ASHANTI 61 autour d'un esprit ou d'un 'fetiche' provenant des Northern Territories. L'auteur estime que l'accroissement de ces cultes peut etre attribue a deux causes principales: I. Les changements economiques et politiques survenus en peu de temps, par suite de l'essor de l'industrie du cacao et de l'influence de l'administration et de l'instruction euro- peennes, ont eu des effets d'une grande portee sur la structure sociale et, notamment, sur celle de la parente. La solidarite du lignage, l'autorite des chefs du lignage et le principe meme de descendance par la ligne maternelle ont dte mis en question et considerablement affaiblis. I1 en resulte que la plupart des gens sont sujets a des inquietudes et a un sentiment d'insecurite en face de changements, qu'ils ne comprennent qu'imparfaitement, et qu'ils ne peuvent controler. 2. Les cultes traditionnels des ancetres royaux, des ancetres du lignage et des dieux ntvro, qui sont etroitement lies a la structure de la parente, perdent leur influence et s'averent in- suffisants pour les besoins du peuple dans une situation changeante et manquante de securite. La religion chretienne ne parait pas etre en mesure d'assurer une pleine satisfaction, mme pour ses adherents, d'une part, en raison de ses rapports avec une culture etrangere, et, d'autre part, parce qu'elle n'accepte pas certains elements dans la pratique religieuse tradi- tionnelle, qui ont un fort attrait. Une caracteristique prononcee de plusieurs des nouveaux cultes est le fait de s'interesser a la sorcellerie. Les techniques employees pour obtenir un aveu de sorcellerie ont un attrait emotif puissant; lorsqu'elles reussissent il en resulte une liberation appreciable de tension et une issue salutaire pour des sentiments agressifs et de mecontentement dans des rapports de parente. L'article comprend une description detaille d'une ceremonie de ce genre. L'auteur n'a trouve aucune preuve indiquant que la pratique d'un des nouveaux cultes avec les cultes traditionnels, ou le christianisme, produit un sentiment de conflit ou de gene, mais elle estime que cette question merite une etude plus approfondie.
