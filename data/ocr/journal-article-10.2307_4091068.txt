Each word has more than one meaning and involves sub- jective interpretation. The expression graphic design is rich in meaning but difficult to pin down. To most people design means decoration: wallpapers, fabrics, fashions, floor coverings, etc., and the term graphic or graphics refers to graphic arts, to the printing industry, or to printmaking (the lesser of the so-called fine arts). Yet, to many, the expression graphic design most often draws a blank. (Note: The term "graphic design" was used by WA.Dwiggins in a statement which first appeared in the "Boston Transcript," August 29, 1922 as follows: 'Advertising design is the only form of graphic design that gets home to everybody." Whether Dwiggins is the original source of this appellation is a matter of conjecture.) The Oxford English Dictionary devotes two columns to the word graphic, mean- ing: drawing, painting, lettering, writing, etching, engraving, vivid, clear; and four columns to design, meaning, among other things, a plan, purpose, intention, model, arrangement, decoration, etc. This plethora of meanings is too broad and imprecise to be clear. Perhaps the term commercial art, once widely used, better describes what it is that a graphic designer does. But it, too, is not sufficiently specific to be truly meaningful. Unsavory associ- ations (or snobbery) as well as the lack of clarity about its scope, may have contributed to its disappearance from the graphic arts scene today. In addition, the word art may suggest overtones of the Bohemian world. Design focuses more on conception than it does on execution. The designer's creative efforts in the form of sketches, plans, or verbal descriptions are often intended to be executed by others: type- setters, printers, papermakers, model makers. The design for a postage stamp or a tombstone may be conceived by a designer, but it cannot come to frui- tion without the skills of a printer or a stone cutter. The revolution in modern painting, with its emphasis on form, on abstraction, on relationships, and subsequently on photography and typography, has played its part in focusing attention on the design of the total surface rather than concentration on anecdote or subject matter. This too has contributed to the change of label from "commercial art" to "graphic design" in which em- phasis is given not to hackneyed, literal illustration but to significant form, meaningful ideas, metaphor, wit, humor, and problems in visual perception. The ideas which have colored our way of seeing and thinking about design are built on the beliefs established at the be- ginning of the 20th century. Essentially, the ideals of the art of representation were replaced by those of formal design. Whether these ideas stemmed from the unorthodox visual concepts of Cezanne or Picasso, or the equally pro- vocative ideas of the symbolist writers and artists (Stephane Mallarme, Emile Bernard, Maurice Denis), formal design, not representation, would determine the nature of visual thought. 5</page><page sequence="5">. . ..: .:;;: . g ...Se . . ....e ;. ..... |.. .... . ... &gt;... .. a....... ..... ........ .. .... .... .. ... .: . ..

Specifically a graphic designer is one who creates ideas, ma- nipulates words and/or pictures, and generally solves problems of visual com- munication. Items requiring the work of a graphic designer before they can be printed or produced include: price tags, catalogues, newspapers, magazines, posters, brochures, advertisements, books, book jackets, stationery, logo- types, packaging, product nomenclature (nameplates), signs-in short, wherever the visual manipulation of word and/or picture is needed, and whatever must be read or viewed. Like any artist, the designer does not produce identical, anonymous products. His work, like the painter's, is unique. He produces one design, one advertise- ment, one poster, even though his work gives birth to countless reproductions. The designer who creates something entirely new is no rarer than the painter doing the same thing. And he, like the painter, is indebted to the same inspira- tion: to history, to other painters and designers, to Lascaux, to Egypt, to China, or to children. That graphic design is generally con- sidered a minor art has more to do with pretension than it does with termi- nology. The paucity of great art is no more prevalent among designers than it is among painters. To be sure, there is a basic difference between graphic design and painting. But that is one of practical application, and does not preclude consideration of form or quality. It merely adds more stress to the normal diffi- culties that original work entails. Back in the 19th century Theophile Gautier's (1811-1872) contempt for the utilitarian in art was expressed in such utterances as: "Nothing is truly beautiful except that which can serve for noth- ing... Whatever is useful is ugly." This was "art for art's sake." And when Adolf Loos, the same man who in 1908 wrote "Ornament and Crime," commented: "Art must be stripped of practical goals," he was echoing the prejudices of a great many artists and art lovers. How does one categorize the design for a printer's device by Hans Holbein, the magnificent medals by Pisanello, or an elegant magazine cover by Bonnard? Attempts to reconcile the formal and practical were made at various times in the early part of this century (circa 1921- 30) by, for example, the Russian Con- structivists, dedicated to a program of good design for mass consumption. They were largely responsible for the at- titudes many today profess in the fields of design, painting, and sculpture and demonstrate that a special point of view is as important as a special skill in achieving distinguished work. The early commercial work of Rene Magritte, for instance, shows that without such a viewpoint exemplary design is not possible. In comparison to the work of A. M. Cassandre, for example, one would have to judge Magritte's graphic design inferior. Ironically though, designers are tremendously indebted to Magritte's visual vocabulary.

"treat nature by means of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone, everything brought into proper perspective, so that each side of an object ora plane is directed to- wards a centralpoint." The statement is, perhaps, the most influential utterance to affect the course of modern painting, not because of blind adherence, but because reference to the cylinder, sphere, and cone was taken out of context1 and innocently mis- interpreted. A simple lesson in Renais- sance perspective was construed to mean that geometric simplicity would now play an important role in the way we perceive modern painting. The work of L6ger and Malevich, circa 1912, literally illustrates this misreading and shows how accidents are often the source of important discoveries.

"Ye Gods! and has it come to this?" was the reaction of F.W. Goudy, the prolific type designer, to the results of the survey which judged News Gothic to be "the nearest approximation of an ideal face" This tidbit appeared in Mr. Goudy's Typologia published in 1940 by the University of California Press. Prejudice is not the only "virtue" of this book. In fact, I found it utterly absorbing and hope that the reader's curiosity is sufficiently aroused to look it up. Equally revealing, although sprinkled here and there with a number of miscel- laneous ideas difficult to agree with, is Stanley Morison's little book, First Principles of Typography Macmillan, 1936. In referring to the design of the title page, Morison dogmatically states "As lower case is a necessary evil, which we should do well to subordinate since we cannot suppress, it should be avoided when it is at its least rational and least attractive-in larger sizes."2 And the discriminating reader will note both the sense and nonsense of the following: "the main line of a title should be set in capitals and, like all capitals, should be spaced." The first part of this statement is, of course, clearly controversial; the italicized part is true most of the time, but not all of the time. Both books, however, are full of scholarly, useful and occasionally amusing infor- mation. Useful, in the sense that they spell out those aspects of type design and certain aspects of typography, which have little to do with trendiness, and deal with those unchanging, timeless qualities about which good design is concerned. 1) Typologia, p. 142 2) First Principles, p. 19 12</page><page sequence="12">Co() 1-voranh 'S Srt</page><page sequence="13">Color Color theories of Goethe, Chevreul, Ostwald, of Rood, or Munsell, among others, are not much help when facing a blank canvas. Color is objective; color is subjective. A color that is perfect in one instance is useless in another. Color is complexity personified. The use of color implies not only a knowledge or, at least, an awareness of the mechanics of color, but also of the formal, psycho- logical, and cultural problems involved. Color cannot be separated from its physical environment without changing. Like design problems, color is a matter of relationships: materials textures finishes light shade reflection figure-ground contrasts proportions quantities proximity congruity repetition shape content How often have we seen the "perfect color"- in a room, a painting, a sky, a rug, a dress, in a paint shop, or paper mill - without being aware of the implications of the surroundings in which this color resides -of the lighting, the architecture, the furniture, the hubbub, the silence and the condition of our own state of mind? Matisse in his Jazz puts the problem in another way. Following is a paraphrase describing the problem of painting a bou- quet of flowers: Walking in his garden one day he picks a bunch of flowers with the idea of painting a bouquet. After arranging the bouquet to his own taste, he discovers that the charm in first per- ceiving these flowers is now lost. He at- tributes this to the reminiscences of long dead bouquets which have influenced the arrangement of this new bouquet. And he ends by quoting Renoir: "When I have arranged a bouquet for the purpose of painting it, I always turn to the side I did not plan" Le Bouquet. Dans une promenade au jardin je cueille fleur apres fleur pour les masser dans le creux de mon bras l'une apres I'autre au hasard de la cueillette. Je rentre a la maison avec l'idee de peindre ces fleurs. Apres en avoir fait un arrangement a ma facon quelle d6ception: tout leur charme est perdu dans cet arrangement. Qu'est-il donc arrive? Lassemblage inconscient fait pendant la cueillette avec le gout qui m'a fait aller d'une fleur a l'autre est remplac6 par un arrangement volontaire sorti de r6miniscences de bouquets morts depuis longtemps, qui ont laiss6 dans mon souvenir leur charme d'alors dont j'ai charge ce nouveau bouquet. R6noir m'a dit: "Quand j'ai arrange un bouquet pour le peindre, je m'arrete sur le c6te que je n'avais pas prevu." It didn't take a master photographer to shoot the flower garden shown here. I was immediately taken by the stun- ning effect of the brilliant colors, and re- alized how the neighboring buildings, the earth, contrasting flowers and leaves, the tints and shades, and being partly on holiday, conspired to make this picture. 14</page><page sequence="14">A 16 '4 -50 .14 Iq4 NO Ir 14 V 11 41 T.4. nk MKSLZ J i.4 c A, Lt A W vt .10 aL . .... .

There are good symbols... like the cross. There are others ... like the swastika. Their meanings are taken from reality. Symbols are a duality. They take on meaning from causes ... good or bad And they give meaning to causes ... good or bad. The flag is a symbol of a country. The cross is a symbol of a religion. The swastika was a symbol of good luck until its meaning was changed. The vitality of a symbol comes from effective dissemination ... by the state by the community by the church by the corporation. It needs attending to get attention. The trademark is a symbol of a corporation. It is not a sign of quality... it is a sign of the quality. The trademark for Chanel smells as good as the perfume it stands for. This is the blending of form and content. Trademarks are animate inanimate organic geometric. They are letters ideograms monograms colors things. Ideatly they do not illustrate they indicate ... not representational but suggestive... and stated with brevity and wit. A trademark is created by a designer but made by a corporation. A trademark is a picture an image... the image of a corporation. 0 The need for simplicity is demonstrated in this blurred image of the ABC trade- mark. How much out of focus can an image be and still be recognized? A trademark which is subject to an infinite number of uses, abuses, and variations, whether for competitive purposes or for reasons of "self expression" cannot survive unless it is designed with utmost simplicity and restraint; keeping in mind that seldom is a trademark favored with more than a glance. Simplicity implies not only an aesthetic ideal, but a meaningful idea, either of content or form, which can be easily recalled.

Man has striped his flags and awnings, ties and shirts. Stripes are dazzling, some- times hypnotic, usually happy. They are universal. They have adorned churches and mosques. Stripes attract attention. The stripes of the IBM logo serve pri- marily as an attention getting device. They take commonplace letters out of the realm of the ordinary. They are memorable. They suggest efficiency and speed. The recent plethora of striped logos in the marketplace attests to their effectiveness. Visually, stripes superimposed on a cluster of letters tend to tie them together. This is especially useful for complex groupings such as the letters IBM, in which each character gets progressively wider, thereby creating a somewhat uncomfortable, open- ended sequence. The multi-colored stripes show a section of an IBM Supply Kit package. 18</page><page sequence="18"></page><page sequence="19">Repetition means remembrance.

It should come as no surprise that, more often than not, meaningful ideas are the product of chance, of intuition, or of accident, later justified to fit some prevailing popular theory, some practical need, or some formal obsession. The symbol for Westinghouse (1960) as it appears today, is an adaptation of an earlier trademark. The problem was to transform an existing lackluster emblem, consisting of a circle, a 'W, and an under- score, into something unique. Updating and modernization were a byproduct and not the focus of this program. The final design, which comprises a circle, a series of dots, and lines, was intended to suggest a printed circuit. One of the comments that this design evoked, when it was being presented, was that it resembled a mask. Although this idea was never intended, I believe that the effectiveness of this symbol is due partly to its anthropomorphism. The mask, since recorded history, has served many functions: to disguise, to pique, to simulate, to enhance, to iden- tify, or simply to entertain. Not unlike the mask, the trademark is a potent and succinct means-for good or for evil. Like all such artifacts, the corn mask shown here serves a ceremonial as well as a practical function. These braided corn masks were worn at agricultural fes- tivals of the Iroquois. 22</page><page sequence="22">I ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~4 ..

The 'U' symbol is an experiment in visual puns, as is the cover design for the AIGA, which combines a rebus (the eye for the letter 'I') and a collection of letters, to produce a mask. Of the twenty-six letters of the alphabet, the letters 'B' and 'I' (see following two pages) are clearly the most graphic and least subject to mis- interpretation. The rebus is a mnemonic device, a kind of game designed to engage the reader and, incidentally, lots of fun. The cat mask is part of a mural project.

Most complex is the task of formulating the problem. Ideally, an assignment should be so conceived as to be palatable, challenging, and absorb- ing, inviting curiosity and encouraging exploration. It should deal not only with formal but with manual skills. Following is a problem description which attempts to fulfill some of these varied and desirable goals. Visual Semantics ': Visual Semantics deals with the use and manipulation of words (letters) to illus- trate an idea, an action, or evoke some particular pictorial image. This involves the treatment and arrangement of letters in such a way as to make a word visually self-explanatory. Problem: Develop three designs with the word "L6ger." From the group of four specified colors (see p. 31) use only black for your first version, add a second color for the next and four for the last. Designs two and three should be seen as vari- ations of the basic idea; not essentially different in concept, they should look dif- ferent in the manner in which color is manipulated. Mere change of back- ground without some other meaningful alteration does not constitute an acceptable variation. Visual analogies which most clearly illustrate the meaning or spirit of a word should be sought, e.g., the letter 'o' is the visual equivalent of the sun, a wheel, an eye, etc. If additional elements are needed to reinforce your interpretations they should be simple, geometric shapes circles, triangles, oblongs; also benday screens or typographical material such as rules, bullets or mathematical signs. ' Semantics. the branch of linguistic science which deals with the meaning of words and especially with development and change in their meanings. Simple letters are preferred to fancy ones. Letters which imitate exotic alpha- bets or eccentric shapes should be avoided. Letters drawn accurately by means of ruler and compass are more suitable than freehand forms. (The reference here does not pertain to handwritten letters which possess their own peculiar characteristics.) The quality issuing from any process (facture), mechanical or otherwise, is a reflection of that particular process, and the visual effect (style) is intimately related to it. The more anonymous the letterforms (unencumbered by individual eccen- tricities or sentimental associations) the more meaningful. Originality is related more to the unexpected idea than to some flamboyant or peculiar technique. To defamiliarize the commonplace, to see it as if it were for the first time, is the artist's goal. Fernand Leger: An important aspect of this problem is to discover the fundamental ideas and design principles governing the work of Fernand L6ger, but not to mimic his work. Many of the working procedures and design processes, formal and otherwise, which concern all artists, are especially discernible in Leger's work. As subject matter he favored the commonplace, so as to minimize psychologically extra- neous associations and to emphasize form. He translated subjects into objects. He saw the human figure as an inanimate object, not unlike a bottle or a guitar. The visual power of the machine, which he saw as a "tool of a social liberation" and a thing of beauty, was interpreted with great force, in its fixed and, particularly, in its moving state. He was obsessed by the idea of movement. The means of achieving contrast and creating ambivalent space were deliber- ately sought and thoroughly explored. He usually treated background and fore- ground of his pictures with equal empha- sis, in a lively, competitive relationship, or as a dialogue between abstraction and representation, between the real and the imaginary. He separated color from its form and studiously avoided the use of local color, thus calling attention both to color and to its object. Free color, free form, free association, and fresh visual combinations were devices he used to animate the two-dimensional picture plane and defamiliarize the commonplace. 28</page><page sequence="28"></page><page sequence="29">. ... . | | S S ] | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ed ward Kensinger __ J ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Brissago, Switzerland 30</page><page sequence="30">Contrast, simultaneity, repetition, and the elimination of conventional space illusion were uppermost in Leger's thoughts. Following are some of the pictorial means he used to realize his ideas: Overlapping (space illusion) Shifting (movement) Enlarging (closeup, microscopic view) Exaggerating (color, shape) Neutralizing (objects, people) Floating (against gravity) Distorting (odd scale) Cutting (cropping) Fragmenting (part for whole) Dividing (negative-positive) Framing (picture within a picture) Rearranging (nonconventional) Coordinating (harmonizing) Repeating (patterns) Grouping (crowding, simultaneity) Isolating (scattering) Colors: Venetian red, raw umber, gray blue, deep gray. Apart from any psychological and sym- bolic associations, color is largely a problem of quantitative relationships. Color values change optically, in relation to other colors, against black, against white, against gray. Overlapping or con- tiguous colors appear to be dimensionally different from those in isolation. The colors for this exercise were chosen for their harmonious relationship, and have no symbolic significance. Format: 26 x 36.6 centimeters. 24 x 24 The format is based on a Root 2 rectan- gle, the proportion of which is derived from the square and its diagonal. It is aesthetically pleasing and has certain practical advantages. Continuous folding in half yields the same proportion. It is also the standard European paper pro- portion (DIN).
