Male's monu- mental project to decode, or dichiffrer, as he described it, the symbolic content of medieval art began with L'art religieux du XIIIe siecle en France, first published in 1898 (and then in numerous revised editions), a work better known in English as The Gothic Image.l This work set out to map 13th-century thought through the period's iconographic repertory; Male's cathedrals were mirrors of theology, and all that could be conceived or uttered in the Church's terms found its analogous ex- pression in Gothic art. Several similarly ambi- tious projects on later medieval art inter- vened before Male turned his attention to uncovering Gothic art's sources, culminating finally in 1922 with L'art religieux du XIIe siecle en France.2 This late publication was meant to serve as a kind of prequel to the 1898 volume, for Romanesque art, with all of the acknowl- edged expressivity and even brilliance exhib- ited by 12th-century artists, still remained in Male's grand scheme little more than a pre- cursor to the dazzling achievements of the 13th century. If the art of the cathedral age was the expression of the summa of Christian knowledge, rationally ordered in accordance with the tenets of Thomas Aquinas and Wil- liam Durandus, then Romanesque art was but a quaint expression of still uncertain theology. In the broadest terms, Male's interest in the interrelationship of religious practice and ar- tistic change remains a current one today, but the study of medieval art for many has long since parted ways with Male's method of icon- ographic interpretation-one that consisted largely in the recognition of normative pat- terns of represented themes (and ultimately of their sources), in identifications that satisfy empiricist cravings, and, most important, in the discovery of the appropriate clerical text to assure us of our identification's heuristic footing. Yet even as we part ways with his method, we frequently find ourselves still looking over our shoulders to Male; his anal- yses of art's relation to hagiography, monas- ticism, and, most notably, liturgical drama were pioneering and still deserve our critical attention. One need think only of Erwin Pan- ofsky, for whom iconographic analysis served a necessary first step to iconological interpre- tation, or Michael Camille, who targeted Male as an icon to be toppled in his mischievously titled book The Gothic Idol, to gauge the range of responses to Male's legacy. The two books under review, one on the Romanesque pe- riod and one on the Gothic, are further re- minders of this inheritance, and of the reac- tions it provokes. Jean Wirth states unequivocally in his intro- duction that Male's opus on 12th-century art is the inspiration for L'image at l'poque romane. It would not be far from the mark to say that Wirth's book attempts to rewrite Male's ico- nography for our own times, revisiting the question of symbolic meaning and cultural patterns of representation. The result does indeed bear some similarity, yet Wirth's scope is both more comprehensive in time and geo- graphic range and more selective in the themes chosen for consideration, dwelling mostly around the phenomenon of the Gre- gorian reform movement. More significantly, it is not so much Male's goal of iconographic identifications that interests Wirth as it is the systems and systematic premises of represen- tation-and their effects on evolving icono- graphic themes-that a probing study of Ro- manesque motifs should recover. Le croire et le voir by Roland Recht likewise revisits some of Male's methodological terri- tory. Recht, however, also holds in reverence the Warburgian mode of interpretation and thus works less through analysis of iconogra- phy, in the sense understood by Male, than through the representational, behavioral quality of images. In other words, Recht seeks to understand the dual evolution of changing theological positions-including such factors as private devotion and even religious taste- and modes of representation. Central to his idea is that the notions of seeing, in theolog- ical and also lay understandings, coincided with changes in representation; that "believ- ing and seeing," as the title declares, are part of the same cultural system and, moreover, contingent on one another for the success of representation. Complementary epistemolo- gies-knowing through belief and knowing through visual understanding-lie at the heart of Gothic art and explain the prolifer- ation of certain art forms that defined the "age of cathedrals." In this striving to under- stand the underlying principles of thought that govern representation, Recht's project is not so different from Wirth's; the procedures, however, by which the two distinguished scholars decode iconography are quite op- posed indeed. For Wirth, practices of representation are structured according to systems, the same sys- tems that organize thought. His goal then is to lay bare the structures of each in order to demonstrate how they overlap. Unlike Male, who sought the normative criteria that estab- lish the stability of a given iconographic theme, Wirth seeks to understand why an image means what it does by signaling its relations to dissimilar and similar images. Through comparative analysis, Wirth tries to expose the determinant formal structure that underlies images. This approach opens up the study of a given iconographic motif to account for precisely those differences of de- tail that would have troubled Male's clean categories (variously labeled "aberrant" or "misinformed" of literate conventions). Like Claude Levi-Strauss on myth, Wirth focuses more on explaining how images operate (within the system) than on what they mean stricto sensu. However, as is frequently re- marked of such structuralist pursuits, the sys- tem that Wirth claims to expose is based on his observation of the images-the same im- ages that, in later passages, he holds up as proof of the system itself. Wirth is no stranger to the challenges of structuralist analysis. The author of numer- ous studies on later medieval and Reforma- tion-era work, Wirth published L'image medi- evale: Naissance et developpements (VIe-XVe si&amp;le) in 1989. This book, while troubled by inaccu- racies and oversimplifications, attempted nothing less than to uncover the logic of me- dieval representation. Grounded in close study of Aristotle and Bernard and guided by Levi-Strauss, Charles Sanders Peirce, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, Wirth sought to explain the ineffable quality of medieval representa- tion through a systematic unlayering of form and content. The effort was not always so successful, to be sure, as individual objects in this sweeping survey often seemed to suffo- cate in the straitjacket of Wirth's structural- ism. The volume reviewed here therefore seems no less a reply to Male's iconography than a palliative to the author's earlier ex- cesses of structuralist logic. The result is an intriguing, if often fantastical, spinning of modern visual exegesis. The book is broken down into four parts of several chapters each, starting with an intro- duction of the work's theoretical premises. Thereafter, the book is organized chronolog- ically to address iconographic themes as they rise in importance from one era to the next and, in so doing, to guide the reader from the murky articulation of image theory in the</page><page sequence="2">758 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2001 VOLUME LXXXIII NUMBER 4 Carolingian era to the distilled rationalism of the waning 12th century. To set up this tra- jectory Wirth argues that there is a syntax of representation that images must follow: "an image's structure is a diagram that allows its objects to be arranged according to an or- dered relationship and to a correspondence of equivalencies. According to the variables necessary for filling the diagram, one estab- lishes parallel relations of isomorphic struc- tures" (p. 84). At the same time, there is also a semantic value of images, or a value of ambiguities and multivalence in icono- graphic interpretations. This "problem" of ambiguous meanings-prevalent in the Car- olingian and post-Carolingian periods-will not actually be mastered until a more ad- vanced stage of Romanesque art. It was only at that time, for example, that artists man- aged to preserve the identity of the specific person represented (for example, Peter) while inventing ways to allow him to stand in as a type for, or prefiguration of, something else (Christ's mission on earth, the pastoral role of bishops, and so on). This, says Wirth, parallels a problem in discussions of the Eu- charist: before the 12th century, the concept of the sacrament was broad and it corre- sponded to the notion of a vague symbol. But by the 12th century the notion that the Eu- charist is and symbolizes at the same time the body of Christ had received its most probing reflection and, significantly for Wirth's argu- ment, its clearest articulation and explication. Henceforth, the artist "seeks visibly to rival with the exegete by discovering procedures to overcome the limits of the image's visible ap- pearance" (p. 91). These procedures show the great extent to which, since the Carolin- gian period, "iconography became a learned art at the expense of legibility." Soon the history of the liturgy would interfere more opaquely and pervasively with the history of images, an evolution, he ominously intones, toward the "esoteric" (p. 95). Part 1, "La sacralisation des images," there- fore traces the structure of Romanesque im- agery back to the late antique and Carolin- gian periods. Calling on the texts of Augustine and Bede, Wirth outlines contem- porary thought on the distinctions between imago and historia, between the licit and illicit uses of images, and on the impossibility of representing the truly spiritual (such as the Word). But the strict Augustinian notions of "image" (as expressed in the Libri carolini) would give way in the 11th century to Grego- rian doctrine (for example, Walafrid Strabo, Yves de Chartres), and from this time forward discussions of images would dwell on their proper adoration, that is, of venerating the prototype beyond the representation. It is really the parallel evolutions of theol- ogy and representation during the 11th and 12th centuries that constitute the book's core pursuit, so parts 2, 3, and 4 all focus on one dominant theological movement of the pe- riod, the ecclesiastical reform led by Pope Gregory VII. Wirth's first task is to grapple with the "crisis of figuration" in the 11th cen- tury, arising just prior to the reforms. This art in crisis is marked by a decline in narrativity in favor of iconicity and by a decline in what Wirth calls "organicity" in favor of a rise in nonfigurative decoration. Unsatisfied by models proposed by Henri Focillon (for his Hegelian formalism) and Meyer Schapiro (whose work Wirth caricatures as divorcing style from iconographic content), Wirth finds more productive perspectives in the work of Jurgis Baltrusaitis, whose theory of the gener- ative power of forms, working themselves out into ever increasing schematic solutions, is here wed to the structural anthropologist's idea of "split representation." Split represen- tation refers to the doubling of a figure's body or body parts (head, torso) aligned along a single central axis so as to account for the figure's wraparound projection onto a curved or angled surface; in this way, the represented figure may be understood from varying viewpoints. Wirth thus explains the development of iconographic motifs- emerging from this representational cri- sis-as a function of the appropriateness, or inappropriateness, of the formal evolution of "splitting." He also attempts to extend this volume-bound model of splitting to the two- dimensional surface of painting (not without a certain methodological paradox), to ac- count for, for example, the bestial initials in manuscripts or even the flattened projection of architecture in the illustrated exegetical works of Hugh of St. Victor. This crisis of figuration was accompanied by a rise in the use of pagan motifs. Wirth explains that following a decline in rationalist thought in the Carolingian period, a domi- nating sense of the "present" manifested itself in writings on natural and unnatural phe- nomena. At stake are issues as far ranging as the dangerous chaos of the forests and the understanding of lunar eclipses. With skill and more than a few sleights of the pen, Wirth leaps from this period's fascination for the mystery of the lunar eclipse to a fascina- tion in artwork for the sliver-moon pedestal of the Woman of the Apocalypse, to mythical women such as Sirens and Melusine, to Eve and Mary, all before returning us back again to exhibitionist Sheelas and suckled Luxuria. The precarious intermingling of pagan myths and emerging Christian symbols slipped too often into the diabolical realms of flesh, blas- phemy, greed, and heresy, according to Wirth, and it was the aim of the Gregorian reform to undo such cultural missteps. A new, commanding direction for theol- ogy, and thus for images, eventually inter- rupted this pagan penchant as the increasing theocracy of the literate produced icono- graphic motifs of new rational clarity. The crucible of religious reform would produce innovative admixtures of iconographic mo- tifs, and these new motifs, moreover, were at variance with earlier iconographic solutions. Part 3 ("La r6forme gr6gorienne") and part 4 ("Incarnation et image") lay out the relation between image and doctrine, and the changes that most interest Wirth are changes in the conception of the Eucharist, in the meaning of Ecclesia as symbol, and in the (in)visibility of Christ. The theme of the Last Judgment, already widespread but becoming even more popular, takes center stage as it provides Wirth with a visual gloss on these three prin- cipal preoccupations. For example, the au- thor points to a growing tendency in Last Judgment imagery to place new emphasis on the instruments of the Passion, on Christ's wound, on the communion of saints, and on the fear of the infernal. Wirth adds that the rise in LastJudgment imagery occurs not co- incidentally at a time when the profanation of the Host becomes a concern of zealous cler- ics. Profanation, with its associations to Judas, whose desecration of the Host at the Last Supper makes him Christ's first executioner, is thus linked to the Last Judgment. Wirth maintains that the intersection of the Eucha- rist with the Last Judgment is significant be- cause of the emphasis placed on communion within the new reform context.3 Last Judg- ment imagery is thus held up as a paragon of precisely the new formal clarity and as an exemplary statement on those very issues that were expounded in contemporary theologi- cal doctrine. This practice of stripping away the overlap- ping layers that embed meaning in a theme so central as the LastJudgment thus provides the author with an invitation to pursue a number of tangential themes, such as repre- sentations of Avarice, the Wise and Foolish Virgins, and Luxuria and related sins of the flesh. For example, scenes of corporal resur- rection invite Wirth to compare the semantic values of nudity with represented clothing and with the values of de-eroticized degrada- tion that nudity often suggests. Erotics and sexuality, in contrast to simple nudity, are often achieved by means of metaphoric val- ues, frequently involving vegetal and animal metaphors. This distinction between fleshy temptation and fleshly decay are both best understood when their proximity to the Last Judgment-whether actual, as in their place- ment in a sculptural program, or allegorical, as suggested in theology-is taken into ac- count. Thus, working outward from his initial observations on the significance of reform for the Eucharist and its implications in Last Judgment imagery, Wirth is able to generate a systematic decoding for images as far-flung as peopled rinceaux, sexualized hybrids, and vi- sual interpretations of Ganymede and homo- social behavior. Ambitious, to say the least. According to Wirth, the effect of the re- forms was to clarify distinctions of behavior and concomitant attitudes toward flesh, pa- gan sources, and final judgment (inter alia). Having therefore identified a handful of such critical themes and having established inter- pretative guidelines for revealing the reform- ist imprint, Wirth proceeds to demonstrate how other images that are often confused as reformist-leaning should not be read as part of reform ideology. The primary focus of part 4, "Incarnation et image," is thus to argue the nonreformist orientation of the painted wooden roof at Zillis, Switzerland. Close at- tention to iconographic and thematic analo- gies among scenes permits Wirth to conclude that an overarching theme of Christian mis- sion should be read into the scenes of Saint Martin and Christ. For Wirth it is the pro-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 759 gram's insistence on "alliances" rather than confrontations (for example, Ecclesia and Synagogue suggest partnership rather than antagonism) and especially the exclusion of scenes of punishment and fleshly torment that identify its nonreformist intent. The ceil- ing program derives its unity from its focus on royal and priestly lineage (issued from Christ), and, since this lineage is ex- plicitly linked neither to apostolic tradition (Peter's role at Zillis is minimized) nor to secular imperial traditions, there is nothing to indicate that the ceiling's artistic patron was already under the sway of the reform movement. In fact, this is the conclusion that Wirth reaches before leading the reader through his visual analysis. Throughout his introduc- tion to Zillis, he amasses historical data to suggest that the Gregorian reform had not penetrated into the narrow valleys of Switzer- land's Grison hills. It is problematic, though, that Wirth must admit that an important landholding family, the Tarasp, were ardent reformers and founded a reformed monas- tery at nearby Schuls; he must also concede that the Premonstratensians were making in- roads in the region, and that by midcentury the monasteries of Mfistair, Schanis, and Cazis were already reformed. Bishop Wido of Coire (in whose diocese Zillis was located), he argues, was nonetheless unaffected by the re- formers' advances; and, he continues, since we should suppose that the roof was patron- ized by Wido or an immediate successor, rather than a lay patron, the roof could not be reformist.4 The issue of patronage is more complicated than this, as records neither at- test to Wido's involvement nor hint at how the enormous expense of the ceiling might have been shouldered alone by the small par- ish (leading some to believe, likewise without firm evidence, in a wealthy lay patron). Fur- thermore, the ceiling's program has led to occasional speculations on its possible reform ideology, but this argument has never re- ceived wide consideration. So Wirth's argu- ment against reformist influences is in a sense based on some circular reasoning, first, on the order of the expected iconography of a reformist program, and second, on the dis- tancing of its supposed patron and remote- ness of its location from reformist impulses. As noted above, this type of reasoning is es- pecially troublesome owing to the "system" of representation that Wirth is proposing to reveal. This sleight would perhaps be not so trou- bling on its own if there were not also other misrepresentations in the book: Wirth's ap- parent mistaking of the modern "tympanum" (presumably for the 11th-century lintel) at St-Andre-de-Sorede and his acceptance of the facade's sculptures-rearranged probably in the 12th century-as an original program of the early 11th century (p. 112); his unques- tioning acceptance of Souillac's jumbled re- lief as a complete tympanum (p. 449); his argument that Eve's hirsute appearance among St-Savin's Creation frescoes indicates prelapsarian sexual nondifferentiation, when he should have acknowledged this detail's indebtedness to well-known 19th-century re- touches (p. 249); the insistence on angel im- agery as the organizing theme of the capitals at Autun, which ignores the subjects of fully half of the extant capitals (p. 239); the asser- tion that church foundations of the laity continued unabated under the reform (p. 303); the revised chronology of Auvergnat churches (pushing Mozat's construction de- cades earlier than most scholars would find acceptable, to about 1080, and placing Notre- Dame-du-Port as early as about 1100); the claim that Cluny's apse depicted the traditio legis (rather than the Majestas Domini, p. 228); among others. In fact, as a result of the unfocused discussion of Majestas imagery- one of the most popular motifs in Ro- manesque art, and one to which Male de- voted his longest and perhaps most influ- ential chapter-such major sites as Cluny receive only periodic mention (not to speak of this motif in manuscripts, ivories, and enamels). The bibliography is limited, which may explain these problems, but such omis- sions raise more questions than they answer and, ultimately, cast suspicions on the useful- ness of Wirth's systematic decoding if even the carefully selected artworks need to be altered to fit into his totalizing framework. The preceding remarks are not meant to downplay the interest of this daring book. Simply, it is worth remembering the complex- ity of the undertaking, the limits of structur- alist interpretation that rest on assumed cog- nitive systems, and the practical problems of relying on oppositional schemas and binaries. At its best, Wirth's method succeeds in follow- ing the evolutions of thought and represen- tation and indicates at which moments they intersect in a way that is intelligible to us today. At the same time, it is the persistent search for unifying explanations that also points up its gravest shortcomings. For exam- ple, when wrestling with the "crisis of figura- tion," the author resorts to Baltrusaitis's explication of geometric schematism, a her- metically inward-looking formalism in which form has no greater function than to satisfy, for an instant and not a moment longer, the form's own will to re-form, which is itself ex- citation to re-form again.5 Yet when in the context of art produced just a few decades later, Wirth deduces that the new rise in fig- ural compositions must be a result of articu- lated ideas on theological matters. What be- came of the self-perpetuating will to form? The Gregorian reform did not mark the end of geometric decoration, nor of double- headed beasts, nor of Sirens or the like; nor- significantly-did the period of "crisis" lack its own great figurative (even narrative) tradi- tions, whether in manuscripts, mural paint- ing, or architectural sculpture (although Wirth chooses not to discuss these). But for Wirth the putatively formless forms are inex- pressible-they are crises of figurability-if there is no articulated position. In such pas- sages the reader discovers that Wirth's struc- turalist pursuit hangs as much on texts as do Male's or Panofsky's; in other words, what strives to be a groundbreaking structuralist investigation of form and context is in fact shaped by the disciplinary expectations of hu- manist philology. Although the comparison to earlier Struk- turanalyse is unjust, one cannot help thinking of Otto Pacht's maneuvers to work from within the work of art to formulate a theory of its being or its becoming, and in so doing to articulate its relation to its environment.6 Throughout Pacht's interpretations, the im- ages retained their visuality while at the same time revealing their structures. In Wirth's analyses the visual rhetoric of the image has been discourteously discarded in the decod- ing process. In wishing to find a systemicite like that of language, Wirth treats the images like the linguistic enonciation, the utterance that prescribes the subject and the subject's net- work of linguistic relations, and leaves it at that. The pursuit of structure occasionally leads him to discover the syntax of an image's formal components and often the formal re- lations between two works of the same icon- ographic theme, but it can never grasp the visuality of the image nor, for that matter, the visual expectations of the beholder. In the end, one finds that it is not so much Male's work that is rewritten as Erwin Panof- sky's, namely, his Scholasticism and Gothic Ar- chitecture (1951), here drafted for the Ro- manesque period. What interests Wirth, and to an extent Roland Recht, is Panofsky's at- tempt in Scholasticism (and even before, in Perspective as Symbolic Form, 1924) to establish formal homologies between methods of thought and symbolic modes of representa- tion. Wirth and Recht strive to exploit systems they believe internal to the art itself, and which are ultimately translatable to the thought of an entire epoch. For Wirth, the project of discovering the systemicite of Ro- manesque art has the advantage of minimiz- ing the historicized, and thus fallacious, re- construction of the image's original context. Recht is less troubled by the problems of context, for he seeks not the formal system or codes but the developing modes of represen- tation and modalities of vision. His approach, therefore, is precisely about the visuality of the image and the beholder. The author of numerous studies on Gothic art and especially architecture and the tech- nology of Gothic building, Roland Recht pre- sents a totalizing view of his own in Le croire et le voire. To lay out his position most clearly and to identify its relation to those of his predecessors, he begins the book with an ex- tended historiographical essay sketching the main lines of Gothic architecture's modern interpretation. Paul Frankl, Hans Sedlmayr, Otto von Simson, Richard Krautheimer, and Gunter Bandmann are evoked as central fig- ures in the field of Gothic architectural criti- cism, and Recht usefully summarizes their contributions to the growing discipline. This engaging review, however, commences with Jacques Francois Blondel and Abbe Laugier in the 18th century and skirts past German Expressionist film and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe to give the reader a broader sense of the field's modern shaping before it finally dwells somewhat longer on Recht's central figures, Pacht, Schapiro, and, especially, Panofsky.</page><page sequence="4">760 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2001 VOLUME LXXXIII NUMBER 4 One could quibble with Recht's adumbra- tions when they are blunt (August Schmarsow is a "positivist" who seeks "structuring forms"), excessively polemical (Schapiro), or generously partisan (Focillon), but his range is inclusive indeed. This section is fascinating in its own right, as no survey of interpretative trends in medieval architecture has been un- dertaken for some time. Such a historio- graphical panorama for the field is also a bit of a novelty in the French literature (owing probably to chauvinisme, if not also for linguis- tic parochialism), but French interest in the older German and Anglophone traditions has been gaining ground steadily (witness the re- cent translations into French of key works by Alois Riegl, Pacht, Panofsky, and Schapiro),7 and this kind of sustained reflection on these traditions' intersections is often illuminating. For example, Recht's review makes patent scholarship's shifting interests throughout the 20th century-its interest at times in ar- chitecture as technological progress, at other times as diaphanous structure, and elsewhere as naturalistic form. For the present work Recht's approach owes something to Panof- sky's perception of a distinctly northern or Germanic trend in painting for a "massive style" (Massenstil) of figuration that reaches its perfect attainment when represented space (especially interior space) is conceived as "ho- mogeneous" (that is, expanding in all direc- tions). Recht, however, mitigates Panofskian space with Pacht's insistence on the impor- tance of the figure and ground (inherited from Riegl), collapsing the space between planes that lends homogeneity to the visible world.8 It is a combination of the two that yields Recht's working model for observing art of the Gothic period, which seeks to con- sider not the way in which space is repre- sented but the way in which space and volume were understood to act together, or perform. The critical moment in this relation be- tween objects and the space they inhabit comes with the advent of the liturgical prac- tice of the elevation of the Host (encouraged by the Lateran Council of 1215, cited by Recht, but the importance of the Feast of Corpus Christi, established in 1264, should not be overlooked). This real presence of Christ-present in the church itself-had a profound effect on worshipers' understand- ing of the cathedral space. No longer could the architecture have merely suggested Heav- enly Jerusalem, the destination of a distant spiritual voyage; henceforth, worshipers wit- nessed the miracle and thus took part in a real and permanent act of their spiritual jour- ney. Moreover, with this slowly spreading pen- chant for Eucharistic spectacle, a number of complementary trends developed, notably, among mendicants (such as Bonaventure and Barthelemy of Bologna) who stressed visual encounters and the metaphysics of sight. The optics of sight also now attracted the studious efforts of Roger Bacon, Robert Grosseteste, and Alhazen, among others. Thomas Aquinas and especially Nicholas of Cusa (De visioneDei) crafted sight into a symbolic form, the alle- gorical instrument for comprehending the invisibility of a God who is himself sightless yet panoptic. Meanwhile reliquaries, while still reflecting the favored anthropomorphic shapes of feet, arms, and heads, increasingly aimed to show the relic itself encased under see-through crystal. Recht extends his interpretative vision to various media, such as altar painting, reli- quaries, and carved altarpieces, but it is his interest in architecture that yields the most illuminating illustrations of his general ap- proach. Ever since Panofsky's discussion of Gothic architecture, there has been an incli- nation to equate architecture with thought, or concepts, namely, as an instantiation of Scholastic rationality and its modes of ar- gumentation. Recht is skeptical of modern interpretations that seek to establish causal relationships between theology and the me- chanics of architectural construction. All ar- chitecture has "content," says Recht, but "a relationship of strict causality between a theo- logical tenet or symbolic model and Gothic architecture is untenable" (p. 160). Recht in fact pushes it further: "Architecture is not made by ideas [L'architecture ne se fait pas a l'aide de concepts]" (p. 160). Our insistence on deciphering concepts has therefore skewed our understanding of architectural develop- ment. For this reason he downplays the inno- vations of St-Denis to laud the cathedral of Sens, for example. Sens marks a decisive step principally in the coordination of its supports and their orders to the vaulting elements, as well as in the sharp contrasts between the dark false tri- bune and the bright double-lancet clerestory, in juxtaposed round and pointed arches, and in the refinements and alternations of mold- ing profiles, all executed for calculated effect. At Sens the architecture cannot be about Gothic light without being about darkness, and this is owed to the use of older (Ro- manesque) forms and speaks to the impor- tant mystical function of light and shadow described by Saint Bernard. He then brings such observations on the visual effects of moldings, wall articulations, and so on to a discussion of new architecture at Soissons, Wells, Soest, and Reims, among others. Fur- thermore, Recht ardently champions an accounting of interior plaster and paint dec- oration in our interpretation of Gothic archi- tecture (drawing on recovered polychromy at Chartres, Ste-Chapelle, and St-Quiriace in Provins), for it bestows a representational quality to these masses and volumes that has long since been forgotten by historians.9 Thus, rather than focus on the technology of building-the introduction of pointed arches and flying buttresses-on which our tradi- tional celebration of Gothic architecture is based (a narrative that begins at St-Denis), Recht directs our attention toward changes in vision and ultimately toward a view of archi- tecture as "pictorial." He writes that a "new phase of architectural history thus com- menced, a phase that accounted for the po- sition of the human observer and that, what- ever one might say, was not made solely for the eyes of God" (p. 171). This type of archi- tecture, he continues, is not a way merely of "distracting" or pleasing the human soul; it was directed specifically to a public "sensi- tized to architecture" (p. 171). Here he is alluding to what he sees as a necessary corol- lary to a new discourse of architectural form: a new learned audience of architects. The rise of the architect, long a problem- atic trope in the study of Gothic architecture, receives here nuanced inflections, the fruits of years of reflection on the issue.10 Recht focuses, as one would expect, on the increas- ing specialization of masonry production and the use of preliminary drawings, as well as on the retreating anonymity of the maitres d'oeuvre. The Gothic architect, however, is not a pure innovator; the authority of the architect lies in his capacity to mix forms and styles, to incorporate old and new elements (as Gauthier de Varinfroy at Evreux), akin to the concepts of auctor and commentator identi- fied by Bonaventure with respect to the au- thors and compilers of manuscript texts (pp. 184ff.). Thus, when attempting to demon- strate just what was the opus francigenum that was exported to neighboring countries, Recht places emphasis not on a disseminated uni- form style but on a manner and technique of architectural construction-an architectural point of view-that had been developing in France (p. 216). Eventually it was the archi- tect's increasingly skilled use of formal solu- tions and a heightened specialization of con- struction that would distinguish him as auctor. In step with these changing attitudes to- ward architecture as pictorial, and as the product by and for an increasingly sensitized public, other fixtures of Gothic spaces- sculpture, choir screens, altarpieces, and so on-likewise contributed to the heightened emphasis on visual knowing. These works forced the beholder to meditate on the pres- ence of absence and on the invisibility of the Incarnate, and Recht, drawing on the writing of Heinrich Suso and Albert the Great, argues that representation evolved especially for this theatrical context. Cathedrals were really the- aters of memory, elaborately decorated stages for rehearsing the dramas of Christian faith, as if to make present and immediate the eter- nal mysteries. The painted retables and carved altarpieces favored the "recollection, even the reliving of the moments of the Pas- sion" (p. 297). Recht illustrates through the example ofVeit Stoss's Cracow altar the types of formal solutions that were synthesized to yield an affective theatrical object: the oppo- sitions of scenes, the juxtaposition of differ- ent proportional scales, and even the fact that the altar was conceived at such size that the wings could not be fully opened in the avail- able space all suggest the "staging event" of the altar's scenes. Part of this pictorial move is art's increasing quality as a mnemonic prop. So great was the expectation that artworks would trigger the memory that they lost their "allegorical or typological character and gradually took on the qualities of stories of real or historical events. The image thus served as a commem- orative device, and the faithful had to take in the image so as not to forget the events of the Scriptures, which, after all, the image was meant to represent" (p. 297). The most no-</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 761 ticeable effect-clearly evidenced in 13th- century sculpture (as in the Ste-Chapelle Apostles or the jube of Bourges)-was an in- crease in figurative legibility. Indeed, it was the "condition of its memorableness," and so the artwork should "lead the story onward by stripping it of any and all elements that would interfere with its reception, all the while en- riching it with elements that render it more 'efficient"' (p. 299). This led to formal affec- tations, previously unimportant but now re- ceiving new emphasis, including gestures, ex- pressions, and especially a Gothic "smile" that was a translation of idealism and beauty.11 Carved or painted details that convey a cer- tain countenance or that suggest individuated costumes-as in the works representing Ekke- hard and Uta, immortalized in nearly life-size sculptures in Naumburg Cathedral, or Em- press Adelheid at Meissen-suffice to distin- guish secular personages from their neigh- bors and to give them a particular status, "addressing themselves more directly to the faithful" (p. 319). At the same time, one finds an increasing responsibility of images to rep- resent the unrepresentable and to introduce tragedy, even if maudlin, into Christian his- tory. The Passion is henceforth the scene of cruelty, suffering, treason, and hate, and for the first time the Neoplatonic adherence to ideal beauty, exemplified in the Incarnation, must yield to the complicated abjection and ugliness that attends the Salvation.l2 In sum, Recht seeks to describe a context of vision and belief that propels, and indeed compels, changes in motifs, styles, and visual practices in a more general way. For Recht the defining events are the development of Eucharistic devotion and its attendant rites and symbols; the mystery of the Passion, whose Gothic gloss owes its origins to the writings of Saint Bernard and then develops in Franciscan and Dominican thought; and the increasing role in society of images at the expense of texts and Scripture. The combina- tion of shifting attitudes toward art and archi- tecture opens the way for architecture to be- come more and more elaborate; as he says in conclusion, "owing to the architecture, [the mystery of the Passion] takes its place in a space directed entirely by a 'Eucharistic per- spective"' (p. 394). For this the architecture necessarily must be neither a functional space nor a formalist play of space and volumes, but must itself be treated as an image. The cross and the Eucharist together define a "perspec- tival space at the center of which is deployed the vision that mankind has of the world.... namely, the choir of a church preceded by the nave.... The elevation of the conse- crated Host makes visible, at a precise loca- tion in this space, the present presence of Christ. It is like a focal point, or a vanishing point, toward which all views converge. It is from this spot that the entire spatial organi- zation becomes meaningful, reposing on the rhythmic succession of bays and on the align- ments of the piers, optically more compact than in the past" (p. 397). Eagerness to sketch so comprehensive a theory of visuality, to suggest the cathedral as the organizing principle of a "visual system," leads the author on occasion to overinterpret formal connections between works. When dis- cussing drapery folds of 13th-century statues, for example, Recht argues that drapery is the analogue to architecture's moldings: the evo- lution of expressive and exaggerated drapery forms parallels developments in architecture, and the concave folds of 13th-century drapery optically detach themselves from the ground, just like concave portions of Gothic molding on architectural surfaces. He acknowledges that one should not push the analogy too far (p. 329), but he persists in his search for parallels in the painted and plastic arts. Such is the connective tissue that is meant to hold the cathedral fabric together-focusing visu- ality toward that "spatial vanishing point"- via the expressive gestures included on the painted altarpiece, the smiles of the carved jube figures, and the costumes of the facade sculpture. Yet regardless of such formalist eli- sions, this essay remains enlightening pre- cisely for its heuristic clarity. Recht would rather not get bogged down in questions that might distract from the main theme, and his measured prose, free of hyperbole and flour- ish, allows the reader to judge how well that theme serves even dissimilar works. Not every- one will agree on Recht's terms and not all here is entirely new, but by recasting old ques- tions of realism and perspective into new hy- potheses on late medieval visuality, Recht has made a significant contribution. This is a work that is deeply learned in which Recht has brought his considerable expertise to bear on a marvelously embracing reading of Gothic art and architecture. Beyond the new interpretations that Recht's perceptive vision brings to Gothic art and Wirth's generous purview brings to Ro- manesque art, these two books also draw at- tention to current uses of iconology in the medieval field and to its ongoing interest in some Continental circles. The one work to which their revisions are most addressed is Panofsky's Scholasticism and Gothic Architecture. For them it is both an inspiration for deeply structured interpretative practice and a model of mistaken epistemology. But for Wirth and Recht the iconographic model is not anathema; merely, it has yet to be adapted to a more rigorous understanding of the medieval principles of signification and image theory. On this score Recht's volume succeeds, for he weds interpretations of dis- cursive thought (theology and metaphysics) to social behavior (religious devotion and public responsiveness), mirroring Panofsky in the former and Aby Warburg in the latter. It could also be said that these works participate in a general revival of interest in Panofsky, felt in France as much as in the United States. But whereas in the latter country Panofsky is aca- deme's favorite whipping boy, scholars else- where are more likely to revise iconography than reject it outright. One need think only of Hubert Damisch, whose searching analysis of Perspective as Symbolic Form struggled to re- solve with philosophy what Panofsky failed to achieve with philology.13 Or Georges Didi-Huberman, who has recast Panofsky through Freud, philosophy, and medieval im- age theory.14 Or the essays recently brought together by Jerome Baschet and Jean-Claude Schmitt on the role of images in medieval society.15 Iconology's shortcomings are well known, but on our own shores Panofsky tends to drown in summary dismissals and re- hearsed criticism. The above works engage Panofsky's legacy precisely to get past it and to exploit the epistemological (or philosoph- ical) cracks in this monumental legacy so as to deploy new, informed tactics of looking at and writing about art. Perhaps for their dialogue with traditional iconology, these studies by Recht and Wirth will seem somewhat "retardataire." But how- ever much these two books are indebted to the method, they also demonstrate the prom- ise of revisiting iconography's structuralist (or certainly at least its "systematic") premises, on the one hand, and its linkage of visual forms to practices of vision, on the other. Recht's book is especially at its most engaging when it opens up the treatment of images to suggest that ways of seeing, believing, and making constitute all together "l'art des cathedrales." Clearly, we have parted ways with both Male and Panofsky, but we still cannot help looking over our shoulders. ROBERT A.

"How many theories (regarding diaphanous- ness especially), how many formalist interpretations seeking to define the qualities specific to Gothic space are undone when the eyes no longer look to read the interior of the edifice as a play of articu- lated three-dimensional forms but instead as an illusionistic construction articulated by the effects of color, which themselves can appear to efface the architecture beneath" (p. 229). 10.

It was born with the appointment of George Kubler as its first professor at Yale University in 1938. Through the pathbreak- ing publications he produced and by his teaching he became the apical ancestor for the lineages of most contemporary Pre-Co- lumbian art historians. That tribe is still rela- tively small, however. The consequence of this demographic pattern is that the field in many ways is still in the process of self-defini- tion and the first essays on many a subject are yet to be written. Kubler's interests were wide and varied and, as a pioneer, he had the freedom to explore uncharted territories, spending more or less time in one or another as he chose. He wrote seminal papers on topics as diverse as colonial architecture in the Caribbean, the Quechua in the colonial world, and the de- sign and space of Maya architecture, to name but a few. As the first to venture into new regions, he had to use what tools were at hand, so his approach was interdisciplinary. At the same time that he relied on a wide variety of sources, though, he increasingly championed a distinctly humanistic approach to ancient American art, upholding his ideals in reaction to the rise of social science as the dominant paradigm for New World archaeol- ogy during the mid-1960s through the 1970s. All contemporary art historians have inher- ited the issues that Kubler faced, whether they are his direct intellectual heirs or not. Central among those issues was the question of how the art history of the native peoples of the New World might take advantage of the strengths of an interdisciplinary approach yet still have something distinctly art historical to say about its subject. The material is com- monly the same as that studied by anthropo- logically trained archaeologists. In an age when canons are being dismantled, Pre-Co- lumbian art history is still building its own. This project has been complicated by an ar- chaeological community that has increasingly looked toward the humanities for its inspira- tion at the same time that many art historians have borrowed from the social sciences. Pre- Columbian art history thus is involved in three separate conversations that frequently overlap. It argues with the rest of art history that New World native arts are worthy of study and appreciation. It is engaged with archae- ologists and historians of the colonial period in making claims for its unique voice. And it has its own internal dialogue concerning what its proper business should be. The four books here under review are in- volved in all of these conversations to differ- ent degrees. Two of them, Esther Pasztory's Pre-Columbian Art and Mary Miller's Maya Art and Architecture, partly respond to trends that Kubler saw only in their early stages: contin- uous growth in public interest in the arts and peoples of the ancient Americas, and a signif- icant increase in undergraduate enrollments in classes on these topics. Both of these books appear to be written for interested laypersons and beginning students and would serve those groups well. Covering the prehistoric art of a continent is a daunting task. It is so daunting that no scholar has attempted such a survey free from association with a limited set of objects from a museum or private collection since Kubler himself, in his landmark The Art and Architec- ture of Ancient America (1962) which is still in print.' In that volume, Kubler attempted to be comprehensive. The current version avail- able is 469 pages printed in eight-point type, with columnar layout. Pasztory's 176 pages in vision-friendly format implies that her book was designed as an introductory essay rather than an attempt at full coverage. It serves that purpose well in the sense that it offers a clear theoretical framework on which to hang the "major" art styles produced in the New World from about 1500 B.C.E. to 1500 C.E. Two very short chapters serve as introductions, one on the Western discovery of Pre-Columbian art and another on the aim of the book in gen- eral, which is to compare and contrast Pre- Columbian art in Mesoamerica and the Andes. The rest of the book consists of three chapters on Mesoamerica followed by an equal number of chapters on the Andes and a two-page conclusion. The text is amply illus- trated with many colorplates and the prose moves along nicely. Pasztory's organizing principle and the the- sis of her argument is that Mesoamerican and Andean art were distinct, contrasting styles. Mesoamerican art was primarily concerned with the human image. It was narrational and naturalistic in its modes of presentation. An- dean art followed a different path, working with cosmic themes in iconic, conventional- ized styles. For each of these great traditions, the author offers a significant style that ran counter to it. Thus, the abstraction of the art found in the great city of Teotihuacan made it unique in Mesoamerica, probably due to a social system and ideology that also were at variance with the common pattern of lord and city-state found, for example, among the Maya. The Moche constitute the counterex- ample for the Andes, with their veristic rep- resentation of animals, plants, and people (such as the famous "portrait heads"), at odds with the highly stylized, abstracted art of Tiahuanaco, Wari, and the Inca. Pasztory sug- gests that the uniqueness of Moche art within the Andean tradition stemmed from the fact that it was a centralized kingdom, just like the Maya, instead of a bureaucratically run em- pire. In other words, Teotihuacan art repre- sented an Andean-like style in Mesoamerica while Moche art was a Mesoamerican-like style in the Andes. Each of these was excep- tional in its own, larger world. Pasztory's full treatment on Teotihuacan exceptionalism is taken up in her other vol- ume, Teotihuacan: An Experiment in Living. She argues that this first huge city in Mesoamerica was founded and maintained by an ideology that shunned the dramatic and personal and instead relied on a style that stressed imper- sonal order. Whereas Maya art was individu- alized and dynamic, Teotihuacan art broad- cast a message of impersonal stability through a minimalist aesthetic, reflecting a social or- der propagating an egalitarian ethos. This was the same ethos that she also believes typ- ical of the Andes. The book offers a primer on the historiography of theories on Teoti- huacan. It also includes an essay on how the Teotihuacan aesthetic was, literally, con- structed through use of assemblage tech- niques, which Pasztory sees as a metaphor for and an enactment of a social and political program of integration of separate parts. She also provides a critique of why Olmec and Maya art have been so readily accepted by Western collectors and art patrons while</page></plain_text>
