<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Rationale for a Cosmoteleological Argument for God Peter A. Bertocci My basic contention is that in the essential rationale of the classical cosmo- logical and teleological arguments there are considerations that take us a long way toward justifying reasonable belief in a particular conception of God. Too often have these arguments been seen as buttresses to other argu- ments or as confirmations of a conception of God more securely grasped on other grounds. What I am calling the cosmoteleological argument concerns itself with the total drift of the world and man's total experience. F. R. Tennant referred to such an argument as the "wider teleological argument"; the name is a secondary consideration. Underlying the cosmoteleological ar- gument is the conviction that, as Plato and Aristotle long ago reminded us, there is no thoroughgoing understanding of order without understanding the goal immanent in it. I am aware of the great thinkers who, finding in mysti- cal experience, or in revelation, or in the ontological argument, the highway to God, would say that at most only the footprints of God can be seen in the cosmoteleological argument. To them I submit that these nonteleological routes to God never enable us, without actual appeal to cosmoteleological considerations, to understand what the relation is of unconditioned Being to the course of history-that is, to what we know of Nature and of man's total experience. Yes, I am affirming that all reasoning about God's existence and nature is in principle no different from reasoning philosophically about the existence and nature of anything else. When we reason about God we cannot do so without seeking the nature of his being and its connections with all other beings and, not the least, with out own total experience-inclusive of logical, sensory, affective-conative, moral, aesthetic, and religious undergoing. With the history of our problem before us, it is high time to realize that to think about "God" is to think about a host of issues; we are not providing cate- chismic answers to catechismic questions; nor should we be surprised that the answer we give will remain open to further investigation. As persons, we seek a reasonable interpretation of human experience as far as we know it in a world that lends itself to more than one interpretation. If we could think of 323</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion man in this world without reference to a specifiable view of God, we should; but I think we cannot. In a short essay there will hardly be space to indicate more than the drift of the argument. I shall emphasize points that I think need "protection" from confusions that take root in the presupposition that we already know enough about God or about the world to find the cosmoteleological approach ineffec- tive. Since so much depends on what I would forward as "reasonable" grounds for belief or unbelief, I must immediately explain what I mean by a reasonably grounded conclusion. By a "reasonable" conclusion I mean a hypothesis that, more coherent than any other with the variety of presumable fact and experi- ence, is therefore more probable than any other. That is, a given belief in a given conception of God would be more reasonable than any other, therefore more probable, if it enables us as cognitive agents to understand the relation- ships among the relevant data. In this view, no hypothesis about the existence of God, no interpretation of fact and experience open to the thinker-actor, is arbitrarily disqualified once it is clear that it harbors no internal logical fault. Investigation may show that a particular view of the world or of God is logi- cally necessary or that a particular revelation about God's nature is more coherent with everything else we know (I myself cannot subscribe to either possibility). But neither view can be arbitrarily granted priority to begin with. Clearly, by "reasonable probability" I do not mean statistical probability. Indeed, I would argue that justification of statistical probability, as an ave- nue to truth in a given area, must itself meet the requirements of being the most coherent intellectual means for solving problems in that area. This disclaimer of the independent validity of statistical or quantitative probabili- ty has immediate relevance to a whole nest of arguments that claim to dis- qualify the search for "probable hypotheses" about God as the Source of world order. These "disqualifying" arguments assume that "probability" must refer only to statistical probability. Their proponents assume that any argument for God "from probability" would require that decision on whether God is the Source of world order presupposes that we have already observed, or could in principle observe, a series of world orders being thrown-as dice, for example, are thrown-in order to decide whether it is statistically more probable that the present run of the world is weighted with God, as it were. I must confess that I think this line of argument is a philosophic howler, and not the less so because it is regarded as decisive by influential philoso- phers. If any hypothesis about the world as a whole can be probable only 324</page><page sequence="3">Cosmoteleological Argument statistically, then that same norm must hold for nontheistic world views as for theistic world views. But as philosophers, be we theists or nontheists, we do not see universes being thrown. Rather, we are constrained to think and to develop hypotheses within some order of things, within a world-on-the-go- with-ourselves-in-it; we cannot think in a world unbegun, or as spectators whose being and action are not involved in, or affected by, what we think. We soon realize that there is a kind of mystery (not simply an unknown) about the very being of any world. Our fundamental concern, nevertheless, persists: to venture hypotheses that are based not on impulse and naked preference alone but on connections that seem to bring more coherence into both our "rational" and "nonrational" experience. The kind of rational- nonrational probability vouchsafed us is the probability that is the guide of life, as Bishop Butler put it; it is reasonable probability, or what I call "grow- ing, experiential coherence." I press my point by expressing it in a slightly different way-since all else I say depends on it. For a person to reason about the whole of things is to engage in the process of seeking a hypothesis by which he may guide his life by assigning priorities to many conflicting and converging "facts" and "val- ues." He cannot test any hypothesis about "all there is" as he tests a hypothe- sis as to what effect the pouring of a sweetener in his coffee will have on it; he cannot run a series of tests in his own life, some to prove that there is, some to prove that there is not, a specific order and goodness in it or in his world. Nevertheless, he cannot assume that there are no observations, no values, that can possibly provide a reasonable clue to the "grain of things" and of his relation to it. If this be called an appeal to the primacy of the practical reason, let us not simply label it, but let us go on to note that every attempt to avoid it seems itself to rest on "practical" assurance. For even when we doubt, we do so in the conviction that doubting that x or y is so is what will hopefully open the way to more adequate conclusions. To be sure, nobody has the right to believe or disbelieve despite preponderance of evidence. But (and many interpreters of William James's "Will to Believe" missed this point) to suppose that one has such preponderant evidence without also tak- ing into account the fighter for truth and goodness himself is to assume that one's own active, yet not unreasonable, orientation is unimportant to the discovery and the evaluation of evidence. I come to the upshot of this plea for hypotheses in philosophy and philo- sophical theology that are as coherent as possible with all the evidence avail- able. For I now call into question two approaches in which it is assumed that we already know that a particular kind of God exists or that a particular kind of natural world exists. According to the first, "supernaturalistic," approach, we are, presumably, foolish in supposing that we can understand the Perfec- tion that God is by way of cosmological, teleological, and ethical arguments, since we never can move from the imperfect to the perfect. On the second 325</page><page sequence="4">The Journal of Religion approach, the "naturalistic-humanistic," we are presumably foolish in sup- posing that we can trust any reasoning about the universe as a whole, let alone about perfect, unconditioned Being, since it is already vouchsafed us what the method is for acquiring truth in the natural world and that it alone is the best guide to all knowledge. Here, what is a segment of our total experience, namely, that which we interpret as the world related to sense experience, is taken as the cue to the best understanding of our experience as a whole. My fundamental thesis is that such methodological imperialism, be it "supernaturalistic" or "naturalistic," prejudices in advance what will be acceptable evidence and prejudges the truth value of conclusions that may be at hand in cosmoteleological considerations.I The preamble to my argument as a whole, then, is this: the fundamental obstacle that reasonably coherent thinking about belief in God has had to face is the imperialism both of the naturalist and of the supernaturalist, for each has assumed a particular idea of God, or a particular idea of Nature, as the controlling guide to what man's experience as a whole can yield. Let me be clear: I am not pleading for some "compromise," some "middle course," in the name of growing experiential coherence. I am pleading for a way of thinking about philosophical and theological issues that does not foreclose prematurely the question of what will be considered good evidence and what conclusions about God, Nature, and man can be acceptable to a cognitive agent. Reason is the knower-actor trying to discover the web of thought and action that, granting ultimate mystery, will enable him to live, both decisive- ly and circumspectly, with such clues as are vouchsafed him. II I begin, then, with a generalization that I assume provides common ground for theist and nontheist: Our theory and our practice presuppose that events within man and in his environment are so dependably related that we can forecast, in the light of our present knowledge of man and world, what is likely to happen under similar conditions. Again, the kind of regularity we discover within substance-causes and their relations enable us to say that, whatever may be discovered as relatively chaotic or indeterminate, we live in relation to a law-abiding world. (I am adopting F. R. Tennant's term "sub- stance-cause" to emphasize, first, that whatever is can act and be acted upon; 1 I suggest that, if Kant had not taken as normative the kind of perfection presupposed in the ontological argument, he could have assessed the evidence in the cosmological and teleological arguments without turning away in disappointment at their inability to justify that kind of perfect Being; and if Hume had not assumed that his criterion for matter-of-fact knowledge must also apply to metaphysical-theological hypotheses, and if he too had not assumed that only a certain kind of being could be God, he might have followed through some of the leads in the teleological argument that he, along with Kant, found very impressive, though inadequate, to prove the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and all-good God. 326</page><page sequence="5">Cosmoteleological Argument second, that such a neutral term leaves the door open to further metaphysical interpretation.) I set, therefore, the minimal cosmological question: How shall we understand the dependable order that enables us to act and to predict our courses in relation to the substance-causes of the known world? The fundamental response of the cosmologists2 I shall phrase all too briefly as follows. If no substance-causes, if no limited pattern of substance-causes, can be said to depend upon themselves for their existence and continuance, then there is no adequately reasonable way of understanding the existence and the dependable relationships among the substance-causes without hypothesizing a cosmic Ground and some relation between it and substance-causes and their recurrences-in-relation. One thing, at least, must be said about that Ground (or First Cause, if you wish). It cannot simply remain "another" among the substance-causes without forcing the initial question upon us again. It must be self-sufficient, causa suz, and related to other substance- causes in such a way as to enable us to understand the contingent substance- causes and their contingent relations. The first contention of the cosmologist is, therefore, that there is an unconditioned Ground whose nature is such that explanation of existent patterns of substance-causes need go no further than it, since its nature clarifies the controlling and directive draft, the final con- nective tissue, that makes possible whatever we know to be existent. I would call attention, at this point, to the fact that no metaphysician who has faced the question as to what makes possible the recurrent patterns in the changing world has come away without affirming some connective ultimates. Nontheists like Democritus and Epicurus, for example, postulated indestruc- tible atoms and space (at least); Samuel Alexander resorted to space-time from which deity was to be an emergent. The question, then, seems to be not whether there is something eternal, whether there is some unconditioned "connective ground," but what its nature is and how it is related to changing existents and the law-ful relationships they bear to each other. One contention the cosmologist does turn his face from resolutely is that the core of things as we know them is a sheer plurality of indestructible, unchanging substance-causes. For such substance-causes by definition have no relation-cognitive, conative, or otherwise-to each other. The cosmolo- gist asks: In the light of anything we already know, how can it be illuminat- ing to say that the order among substance-causes has no foundation in their own natures, that the recurrent relations we depend upon have their ground in substance-causes that presumably have nothing in common? Do we not, for example, whenever we come upon an occurrence that we cannot relate to other occurrences, proceed to question our scheme for understanding until we can discover some trustworthy linkage? Do we not guide our action by the 2 "Cosmologist" refers to the exponent of the interpenetrating cosmoteleological argument (which is itself part of the broader cosmoteleological-moral argument). 327</page><page sequence="6">The Journal of Religion assumption that further knowledge will bring the unrelated into relationship with the mainland of our experience and knowledge? In short, the pluralist, faced by the same problem the cosmologist faces as to the way in which the ultimate is related to specific orders of substance- causes, must leave his sheer pluralism by introducing a principle that is com- mon to all substance-causes. This far he must go, unless he simply utters the words that substance-causes (including himself), which by definition are re- lated to nothing else, do somehow enter into relationships. And these rela- tionships, we remind ourselves, are so recurrent and so interconnected that we think it reasonable to say, for example, to the searcher for the presently unknown causes of cancer, "Be patient! Some dependable relationship will be found to exist among the substance-causes involved in the occurrence and persistence of cancer!" In this situation the cosmologist wonders: Why go out of one's way to court an answer incoherent with experiential thought and practice? Why not hold that our generalization about the uniformity of na- ture is itself a clue to the structure of things, specifically, to an unchanging ground that accounts for the appearance and continuance of substance-caus- es and their relationships? I shall state what may be called the second step in the cosmologist's ratio- nale in a way that almost invites a common criticism. The cosmologist is, in effect, arguing that, if every substance-cause is contingent, and if nature as we know it (or any particular organization of substance-causes), in this epoch or any other epoch, is contingent, then we must conclude, that any world order is contingent and therefore need not exist. But if we say that this or some other series of substance-causes did not have to exist, we must conclude also that it is reasonable to say that nothing, nothing, nothing need exist. If this be reasonable, it certainly is not reasonable in terms of anything we know. Given existence, we should at some point need to add, equally unreasonably, that from nothing something comes, from nothing something has come. To the contrary, the cosmologist argues: Some unconditioned ground there is such that every form of contingent substance-cause and relation is forthcoming. No sooner has this argument been uttered than one hears the cry: The fallacy of composition has been committed! From the fact that the parts of a whole are contingent, you cannot argue that the whole is contingent! Now, indeed, anyone who argues that a whole must have the qualities attributed to its components should ask himself whether he is committing the fallacy of composition. But does one fear that he has committed the fallacy of composi- tion if, for example, knowing that every member of a committee has taken a lethal dose of poison, he claims that the committee will die? The cosmologist is logically safe insofar as he argues that, if every being and relationship is contingent, then any whole made up of these beings is contingent. Indeed, the cosmologist, far from being intimidated by the fallacy of composition, presses his thesis that we resist conclusions about a whole when coherent thought 328</page><page sequence="7">Cosmoteleological Argument about the components does not in fact support them. He insists: What makes it possible for substance-causes to be and to be related as uniformly as we have ground to think they are, if we say either that there is nothing in the substance-causes that grounds the regularity that characterizes the world or- der as we know it, or if we deny that an unchanging Ground is somehow related to the substance-causes in a law-abiding world order upon which we depend in theory and practice? This line of argument, I suggest, is overlooked by John Hick3 when he says that the theist must concede that there are no actual, reasonable grounds for preferring a theistic hypothesis to a naturalistic account of the order of the world, that the argument between theism and naturalism is a draw. In reply I must suggest that Hick seems not to see how deep the cosmological thrust goes. Hick argues as if the naturalistic account is more obvious than the theistic-as if the theist were adding something that naturalism presumably can do without. But the cosmologist is asking the more basic question as to whether the kind of order presupposed by our faith in the uniformity of Nature can indeed be more reasonably understood on a naturalistic account of that order. He is proposing that the naturalistic account of the order we presuppose, for example, in scientific investigation simply is not the best ac- count of that order. This is the time to remind ourselves that the cosmologist is not phased by the naturalistic suggestion that we have no way of knowing how many world orders were bungled before the present epoch of order oc- curred, or that the present cosmos is, for all we know, an oasis in a desert. Even if these arguments were relevant and applied to the theist but not to the naturalist, they would not favor a naturalistic interpretation of order. Again, the cosmologist is not adding a "supernatural" factor to a "naturalistic" world; he is seeking a reasonable ground for the kind of order that our thought and action keep on assuming. It cannot be stressed enough, then, that the cosmologist, in affirming a self-sufficient Being, is not adding a cosmic Being to the world of Nature that we presumably already understand. The unconditioned Ground does not stand alongside the realm of Nature or prior in time to it; it does not serve as a buttress to orderly world change already understood. The cosmologist is holding that a nontheistic world view is inadequate to begin with, that on a nontheistic view of world order too much remains opaque. To be sure, the specific relation of God to the world remains of considerable moment, but however that relationship is to be conceived, the cosmologist insists: No un- conditioned Ground, no world order. He does not move from a naturalistic view of world order to God, but he asks whether any world order of contin- gent beings and events is better understood, to begin with, on naturalistic or on theistic terms. 3John Hick, Arguments for the Existence of God (New York, 1971), chaps. 1-4. 329</page><page sequence="8">The Journal of Religion Nor is the cosmologist intimidated by the facile comment, frequently made at this point by supernaturalists, that, on his view, "God is, after all, only a hypothesis!" He replies: To hypothesize God's existence is not to hypothesize a hypothesis! It is to claim that an unconditioned Being exists without which any world order-now or ever--can be reasonably understood. When we hypothesize-as when we hypothesize that there is no life on Andromeda- we are affirming some state of being, not a hypothesis. Again, it is all too easy to regress at this point and argue as if we already knew what world order calls for. The cosmologist is pleading that we change an inadequate cosmic scenar- io-an inadequate philosophy of science, if you will-and view the world order as the manifestation of an unconditioned Ground without which our trust in a law-abiding scheme of things remains unreasonably groundless. III Theists and nontheists have evaluated cosmological arguments in the light of presuppositions about the nature of God, or perfection; or what is worth worshipping, or what will count as adequate evidence for any world view. At this point, therefore, the cosmologist must not feel constrained to assume a particular view of perfection; nor can he justify any attribute of the world Ground without indicating the evidence for it or the problem it solves. Since I shall not in this paper be able to explore the grounds for a fuller conception of the unconditioned Being, it may be helpful if I suggest the basic view of God that seems to me to be reasonably justified once we gather the available evidence together reasonably. The unconditioned Being, God, is a Person, that is, a being aware of himself and the goals of his activities. This cosmic Person is the contemporaneous Creator and Sustainer of the contingent or- ders of being, including finite persons. The cosmic Person has never been and will never be less than a Person, but the quality of his awareness is affected by the way in which he is related to the being(s) that depend upon him. I shall not argue the point in this paper, but it seems to me that we cannot deal with the problem of nondisciplinary, nonmoral evil without hypothesizing that there is a recalcitrant factor within the cosmic Person that has not been fully "persuaded," to use Plato's term in the Timaeus, to realize a more complete good. There are many who hold that such a cosmic Person does not meet the requirements of the religious consciousness, but I would argue that neither moral nor religious experience authorizes the absolutistic view of Perfect Being usually assumed by these critics. However, in the remainder of this paper I shall confine myself to outlining the grounds for a temporalistic, theistic view of the cosmic Person. To proceed: the central fact that the cosmologist has placed before us is a world order that we know as changing and yet sufficiently unified, structured, 330</page><page sequence="9">Cosmoteleological Argument and law-abiding for us to be able to trust in the uniformity of Nature and to deem the world order a universe. However, there is nothing in the argument so far that allows us to decide between the hypothesis of an all-embracing One (Mind) as suggested by many rationalists and mystics, and the hypothe- sis of a cosmic Mind that is both transcendent and immanent, as classical theists hold on moral as well as on mystical grounds. Despite their dis- agreements, both absolutists and theists have usually agreed that this cosmic Ground is a unified conscious Being, the Mind that constitutes "world order" a universe. The decisive factor in absolutistic and theistic thinking is that they can point to no other kind of being than conscious being, minimally analogous to what is basic to consciousness in finite persons at their best, as capable of the kind of unity a universe requires. Ultimate, cosmic Unity cannot come into being bit by bit-to suppose that universe can itself be no more than a series of moments that build up to a unity is to bring back our cosmological problem all over again. Once we atomize consciousness any- where, we are in the same pluralistic situation that led us to reject atomized matter. I submit that when Leibniz rejected material units (atoms) in favor of mental monads because only the latter, as far as we know, are intrinsic uni- ties, that when Borden Parker Bowne reiterated that there can be no succes- sion of experiences without an experience of succession, they were both arti- culating the fundamental considerations that have guided most cosmological thinking. For if an unconditioned Unity constitutes the formative difference without which world order remains opaque, then what we know as related present, past, and future requires the kind of unity that the highest form of mentality we know, in the human person, exemplifies. At this point I am, without apology, depending on analogical reasoning from the kind of conscious mentality as we find it in persons to the cosmic Person. Objections to regarding the cosmic Unity as a person have, of course, been affected by views of what is essential to the being of a finite person; and this is one of the great issues that affects thinking about God. I can, once more, only indicate what is fundamental to my view. A person knows himself to be an active, changing being. It is this kind of unity-in-succession, a unity- in-continuity, that suggests the best clue we have to the unconditioned Unity manifested in univers-al-world-order. The experiential cosmologist must not falter here through fear of analogical thinking, especially if he can further defend his view by analyses of related metaphysical and epistemic issues. (But has his opponent not also been involved in analogical reasoning?) As an experiential cosmologist, I would argue that with regard to matters of fact we cannot but proceed from the known to the inferred on the basis of what is already reasonably established. The cosmologist must indeed beware of the illegitimate anthropomorphism that too readily defines the cosmic Ground by attributes that quite clearly 331</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion belong only to finite minds. But I for one am impressed by all those thinkers in history who have bewailed the "belittling" anthropomorphizing tendency in thinking about God as Person only to return themselves to attributing consciousness in some form to the Ultimate. Spinoza, for example, excoriates anthropomorphizing and then cannot exclude Thought from the two known attributes of Substance. Hence I stand firm with my teacher, Edgar S. Bright- man, who never tired of reminding us that if God is to be conceived as superpersonal, superconscious-as God above God, as Tillich says-then those who do so should tell us what "super" is supposed to add to our wisdom. Is "super" intended to deny to God awareness either of himself or of the world his very being unifies? Surely not! So, I repeat, the cosmologist from the beginning agrees that he cannot know all, let alone capture the mysteriousness of their being within a phrase. But he must reject pious appeals to "ultimate" mystery; he will not take asylum in human ignorance when the going gets tough. Philosophical reason- ing is always tough; mystery and ignorance are always present. But from mystery nothing but mystery follows! Mystery must not be used to protect some "deep conviction" about what the mystery is like. All thinking is an- thropic; and, as Gilson put it, we must beware only of "illegitimate anthropo- morphism" as we, thinkers-actors, accept without flinching the responsibility for as much reasonableness as possible. To continue, the theist and absolutistic monist who can agree that uncon- ditioned Being is a Unity of Consciousness now coming to a parting of ways. For the theist does not see how any view that all being is ultimately One can square with the finite person's experience of free will or with the specific quality of mutual response that characterizes man's experience of love, secu- lar or divine. If I pass on with the comment that I think the theist is right here, it is not because I think that the theist is left without problems or that recent absolutism of the sort one finds in Josiah Royce, William Hocking, Paul Tillich, or John Findlay is without serious challenge to theists, but because this running debate calls for separate treatment. This much must be said. On any view, the relation of the finite world order to the cosmic Ground is tied in with the difficult problem of properly conceiving of agency and interaction. The personalistic theist needs to work out an adequate metaphy- sics of the relation of finite agents, with different degrees of freedom, to their Creator. The problem is by no means easier for panpsychists and panen- theists who posit subhuman hierarchies of individualized agency. I confine myself to little more than a suggestion of what seems to me to be involved in an adequate doctrine of God's relation to persons who are free within limits. Whatever the conditions in the physical and biological world suitable for the appearance of persons, the theistic contention is that they are God's creation, created in relation to the law-abiding world and in accordance with God's purpose for all created being. This doctrine of creation has been 332</page><page sequence="11">Cosmoteleological Argument phrased by theists as creatio ex nihilo. What is meant by this doctrine is all the more puzzling if it is not seen in the context of the problem that philosophical theologians confront. For example, if God is coeternal with any being or beings other than himself, then we face the problem (already met in our discussion of sheer pluralism) of understanding how beings that, by defini- tion, have no relation to each other can so interact that the world order we know can come into existence. If, on the other hand, all finite beings are emanations from God's own being, or if they are centers of God's being or "instantiations" of the One, both the appearance and the locus of responsible freedom, let alone of experienced mental unity, are not reasonably forthcom- ing. Considering these alternatives as dead ends, theists resort to creatio ex nihilo. This doctrine, rejected as simply inconceivable by the ancient Greek philoso- phers and by Eastern philosophers, as well as many others, is not held "with ease" by a theist. But he pleads for better understanding.4 Creatio ex nihilo is not intended even to suggest that God took little bits of nothing and created a world, or that anything came from (let alone returns to) "nothing, nothing, nothing." The theist does not hold that he knows how God creates, but he reminds his opponents that no other doctrines of change and of "creativity" actually tell us how. The Theist simply says that God is the one kind of being who can create, that is to say, who brings into being creatures that did not exist before his creating act. For the theist, then, creatio ex nihilo is a hypothesis to get him out of a difficult situation on any view. He contends: God creates-period. Most theists have confessed that this doctrine has no exper- iential base in the world order or human experience. I have argued elsewhere that, in the moral freedom of persons, we do find an experiential basis for such creatio. IV I come now, however, to the thesis of classic theism (and of the founder of American personalism, Borden Parker Bowne)5 and of classic pantheism: The transcendent Creator, although immanent in his changing creation, is himself in no way changing. On any view, I have said, the nature of the relation of the cosmic Ground to the order of history remains a formidable problem, and I remind myself of this fact now. I am aware, for example, of 4 See my The Person God Is (New York, 1970), chaps. 9, 11, 12. 5 Borden P. Bowne, in Theism (1897), succinctly expounds a classical, personalistic theism that is further supported by his works in epistemology and metaphysics. Edgar S. Brightman, his creative disciple, developed a personalistic theism (also supported by an idealistic theory of reality), but he rejected a substance-metaphysics and theory of the person in favor of a temporal- istic conception that is an alternative to process-metaphysics and theology (see Person and Reality, ed. P. A. Bertocci [New York, 1958]). 333</page><page sequence="12">The Journal of Religion the (more often implied than expressed) argument that, if a self-sufficient Mind were to change in any way, the instigator of change would have to exist beyond it, and we would then face the problem of external coexistent Beings again. Here, however, the classic cosmologist tends to be influenced, wrongly as I see it, by the unargued absolutistic view of self-sufficiency as perfection. I do not at this point need to advance the heavy artillery of recent process meta- physics and theology to point out that, if the cosmologist is to insist on his central thesis, that the changing world order calls for a sustaining cosmic Ground, then that cosmic Ground, involved as it is in every moment of histo- ry, can no longer be understood as nontemporal or unchanging. Again, large issues in metaphysics are involved, and I shall here take a shorter route that I think viable. The Person, God, is, in Brightman's term, omnitemporal, a time- binding Creator, a contemporaneous Cause, whose being is affected by his involvement in the historical process. I cannot give up the hypothesis of unconditioned Creator, but am I con- fined to a concept of unconditioned Agency that is "pure Act" with no poten- tiality, a Creator who cannot become without losing self-identity? I suggest that in persons we have self-identifying unities with activity and potentiality. Since the controversy that has raged and is still raging over the nature of the person is so great, it will seem that I have jumped out of the frying pan into the fire. But the one meaning that personal mind has consistently had-even for those who doubt its existence-is that of a unitary being who, in thinking and acting, is the same despite differences in the objects and qualities of his experience. While I myself would hold that the complete human person can- not be adequately defined apart from his consciousness, self-consciousness, his body, and his unconscious, I also contend that no theory of mind-body-and- unconscious can defy the ineluctable fact of any person's experience of him- self as a unity-in-continuity, as a self-identifying unitas multiplex. This much can be suggested here. Theorizing about the person, indeed theorizing about anything, by the person presupposes the unity-and-continui- ty to which each of us attests. We cannot explain a self-identifying person as an effect of many streams of events, or as a juncture, a marketplace of conver- gent streams. Such views would indeed leave the personal identity we experi- ence completely at the mercy of changes beyond itself, whereas we experience ourselves as the same in changing.6 Earlier I said that to be a mind is to be an experient for whom events and changes could be known as succession. The attempts of some of my own revered teachers to save this fact by appealing to a "pure" unchanging ego, to a unity that is itself and "has" its experiences, succumb to the difficulty that keeps confronting us when we try to conceive of 6 The self-identifying person is not to be confused with the more or less unified personality that a person acquires by interaction with the environment. 334</page><page sequence="13">Cosmoteleological Argument a nontemporal unity-continuity that can be "in" its changing experiences and itself be unchanged in any way. What the theoretical situation requires is a different view of the person as the same, yet different continuing agency. The notion of self-identify as identical, in a logical or mathematical sense, simply does not square with our experience of ourselves as person-al self- identifying agencies. I suggest, then, the thesis, the model, if you please, controlling temporalis- tic, teleological personalism. A person experiences himself as a self-identifying unity of activities (those activities are later distinguishable, I suggest, as the irreducible but not separate activities of sensing, remembering, imagining, thinking, feeling, emoting, willing, and moral, aesthetic, and religious experienc- ing). This self-identifying thinker-actor when used as the basis for a hypothet- ical rendering of unity-and-continuity seems more reasonable than that of a substantive soul or mind that is held to be immanent in change without itself changing in any respect. To be sure, in my finite experience there are inter- mittencies and discontinuities. Yet the fact, the brute given without which I am not I, without which no reasoning is trustworthy, is that I, whose con- sciousness is discontinued in some sense in sleep and unconscious states, am the very one who recognizes myself as having been asleep and "in an uncon- scious state"-whatever final theory we have about unconsciousness. While much more needs to be said in elaboration and defense of this conception, I must warn that such identity as persons experience cannot be explained by referring to bodily or physical processes which themselves would then be confronted with the same problem-how a cell, for example, can be one, yet change, and be said to continue. So I stand firm: I am not a collec- tion, or a bundle, of activities or experiences linked to an unchanging anchor; nor am I a center, or instantiation, of an unchanging One (Alpha and Ome- ga). Clearly, I am proposing a different paradigm of being, for "being" now is the adjective for "becoming," and "being-becoming" is the ultimate nature of finite or nonfinite substance-causes. We have here a watershed in meta- physical reflection. It is this conception of person as being-becoming that may be extended, by cautious analogy, to the contemporaneous Creator. What is also being chal- lenged here, however, is the notion that perfection must mean unchanging in every respect. Is a Creator less than "perfect" if he is creatively related to all beings who depend upon him, including persons to whom he has delegated relative autonomy? We are involved now in "conflicting" conceptions of per- fection. I, for one, can understand that, if I were asserting that change qua change (whatever that could possibly mean) is ultimate, no kind of goodness, no kind of perfection, could be attributed to being. But the proposal of the temporalistic, personalistic theist is that the Creator-Person is neither un- changing nor withering as he changes. Indeed, were the nontemporal Person of the classical cosmologist the only being conceivable or experientially defen- 335</page><page sequence="14">The Journal of Religion sible, I would accept it. But as I see it, for a finite person7 to be is to be- become: a finite person is self-identifying as he acts and changes in relation to other substance-causes that contribute to the quality of his being. I can see no adequate reason for setting this clue aside as I seek a way of understanding how a Creator-Person, unchanging as Person but affected by the very world he creates, can remain himself a self-identifying Being and qualitatively af- fected by the actual course of nature and history. As I have hinted, this view needs further support by adequate metaphysical theory of substance-causes, of cosmic teleology, and of good and evil. V The gist of the argument in this paper is that, while we may reasonably argue to an uncreated cosmic Person as unchanging Ground of the world order we know, we may not do so without constantly evaluating our hypothesis by its ability to resolve problems we encounter as persons engaged in thinking and acting in an environment whose nature, far from self-evident, we find de- pendable. In particular, we must not be victimized by a classical notion of perfect Being, that is, a being whose quality cannot be affected in any way, who, as Hartshorne puts it, cannot surpass himself in any way. Moreover, too long has thinking about God been controlled by the view that we cannot move from the imperfections of time, change, and human experience to a perfection that involves not only self-sufficiency but also no change in any way. This conception of perfection has influenced our interpretation of the moral attributes of God. In a word, when the "imperfections" of a changing world suggested that God is morally perfect but that his or our fulfillment is never perfect in the classical sense, we were urged to realize that our meager light is faulty and that faith in unchanging Perfection must seek under- standing-but, of course, never really expect it on "ultimate" points. I have been arguing, to the contrary, that our understanding is synoptic human reason seeking a faith that is coherent with what is in our achieve- ment and grasp as we remain sensitive to different dimensions of our experi- ence and our world. In the light of considerations adduced, the way is open to a reasonable faith in a Creator-Person whose very transcendence as a self- identifying Creator-Person involves his contemporaneous involvement in histo- ry and his constant concern to maximize the quality in his interactive rela- tionship with the different kinds of substance-causes. On this view, transcen- dence does not "free" God from time. Rather, transcendence enables him to 71 find myself siding in the main with my teacher and colleague, E. S. Brightman, against Borden Parker Bowne in America and my revered teacher, F. R. Tennant, in England. At the same time, I find that the route view of personal identity advocated by Charles Hartshorne and other process theologians in America does not protect adequately the intrinsic unity of personal consciousness that Bowne and Tennant were concerned, correctly, to save. 336</page><page sequence="15">Cosmoteleological Argument work in the temporal process without becoming its victim, especially as he relates his endeavors and aims to the different qualities of agency he has created. In a universe that is "a vale of soul-making," the quality of the Creator's becoming is in part a byproduct of the quality of the cocreativity of persons. This kind of perfection characterizes an unconditioned Person who, as Creator of cocreative persons, knows at his level that quality of blessedness (not "happiness," not "peace") that persons reach when they are responsible in their responsiveness to each other, even when they are not successful. A final comment is directed to the religious mind that would claim that this view of the cosmic Person, that this kind of Universe, is not worthy of our worship. I am glad to be able to appeal to the Hindu poet, Rabindranath Tagore, who gives this answer: Leave this chanting and ringing and telling of beads. Whom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut? Open thine eyes and see thy God is not before thee! He is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground and where the pathmaker is breaking stones. He is with them in sun and in shower, and his garment is covered with dust. Put off thy holy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil! Deliverance? Where is thy deliverance to be found? Our master himself has joyfully taken upon him the bonds of creation; he is bound with us all forever .... Meet him and stand by him in toil and in sweat of thy brow.8 8Amiya Chakravarty, trans., A Tagore Reader (New York, 1961), p. 295. 337</page></plain_text>
