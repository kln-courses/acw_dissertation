When taken at face value, this material seems to indicate that Jews during the Second Temple period interpreted the second commandment as a prohibition against any form of figural representation, regard less of context or function. Using his Bellum Judaicum as a test case, I aim to complicate this picture by shifting attention away from the referential value of these so-called iconoclastic narratives to their rhetorical function, i.e. to the way in which these narratives are uniquely shaped to contribute to larger rhetorical themes in Bellum. Keywords Josephus, Bellum Judaicum, Sculpture, sacred space, idolatry, Second Command ment, Flavian Rome It is fairly well known that the relationship between Jews in antiquity and sculpture was at best strained, and at worst, downright volatile. Or at least 11 The seeds for this article were first planted in a graduate seminar on sacred space led by Prof. Yaron Eliav of The University of Michigan. I wish to thank the Frankel Center for Judaic Studies, the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology and the Interdisciplinary Statuary Proj ect, whose generous summer research grants began my journey into the fascinating realm of statues in Greek literature. An earlier (and much shorter) version of this paper was pre sented to the Interdisciplinary Workshop on Boundary Crossing and Cultural Exchange at The University of Michigan, and I wish to thank the participants for their helpful discus sion, as well as Yaron Eliav, who read and commented on a preliminary draft of this paper. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2008 DOl: 10.1163/157006308X252795</page><page sequence="2">J. von Ehrenkrook / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 170-191 171 this is the impression one gets after reading the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus. A golden statue of an eagle that Herod erected over the gate of the temple in Jerusalem falls victim to an axe in the hands of an angry mob. Gaius Caligula's attempt to erect a statue of himself in the same temple stirs the masses into a frenzy, and almost results in the martyrdom—or suicide depending on one's perspective—of thousands. Even the seemingly innoc uous images of Caesar affixed to Pilate's military standards incite the indig nation of many in Jerusalem. It is no surprise then that many scholars identify the period before 70 C.E. as an age of aniconism in which Jews would not tolerate any kind of figural representation, regardless of context or function. In the words of Cecil Roth: "There is overwhelming evidence that human images, whether in the flat or in the round, were not tolerated by the Jews in the period before the destruction of Jerusalem."2 Whether or not such a sweeping historical claim is warranted by the available evidence, and I suspect the situation was a bit more complicated than is typically allowed, very few have considered the extent to which the portrait that emerges in Josephus' narratives is even a reliable indicator of the actual situation.3 Josephus' reports of aniconism are simply taken at face value, so much so that many even suppose that the author, who likely composed much of his oeuvre from the comforts of Vespasian's villa,4 per haps even while sitting in the shadow of Venus herself, embraces a more strict interpretation of the second commandment than even the rabbis of the Tannaitic and Amoraic periods.5 21 Cecil Roth, "An Ordinance against Images in Jerusalem, A.D. 66," HTR 49 (1956): 169 77 at 169. 31 One notable exception is the art historian Gutmann, who in 1961 argued that Josephus' supposedly strict interpretation of the second commandment is more indicative of the authors apologetic concerns before his Roman audience. According to Gutmann, Josephus attempted to circumvent the implication that Jewish resistance to Roman images was the manifestation of a "Jewish hatred of Rome's oppressive rule" by inaccurately rooting this resistance in a strict observance of Jewish law; see Joseph Gutmann, "The 'Second Com mandment' and the Image in Judaism," HUCA 32 (1961): 161-74 at 170. 41 Josephus, Vita 1.423. 51 According to Roth, "Josephus shows himself more rigid than the Rabbis of the Talmudic period"; see Roth, "Ordinance against Images," 176. Feldman likewise contrasts Josephus' overwhelmingly negative perspective with the more accommodating Rabbinic tradition; see Louis H. Feldman, Josephus and Modern Scholarship (1937-1980) (Berlin and New York: De Gruyter, 1984), 512.</page><page sequence="3">172 J. von Ehrenkrook /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 170-191 But there is reason to be suspicious here. I believe that a closer examina tion of these so-called iconoclastic narratives in Josephus suggests that the author is not simply describing what happened, but is instead sculpting events, as it were, shaping unique portraits of aniconism that contribute to larger rhetorical themes within each of his main compositions. Moreover, the resulting images of aniconism and iconoclasm that emerge in Josephus, which on the surface certainly seem to depict the Jewish struggle against the forces of "paganism" or "Hellenism," are actually patterned after cer tain modes of thought and perceptions that were prevalent throughout the Greco-Roman world. Thus, embedded in this discourse on cultural conflict conflict is, ironically enough, evidence for confluence,6 further supporting the notion that Jews in antiquity were part and parcel of their Mediterra nean milieu.7 With this in mind, I wish to concentrate in the following analysis on the aniconic narratives in Josephus' Bellum Judaicum as a test case for explor ing what we may call the poetics of idolatry.8 More specifically, I will argue the following theses: first, that sculpture in this text functions as a kind of mapping device, as a means of constructing or imagining a sacred territory. Second, that the resulting "sacred map" is actually more about locating self than the sacred, about negotiating identity within a particular place and time, and in the face of a variety of socio-politico-cultural forces, in this instance, Flavian Rome. Cognitive Cartography and the Perception of Space Before examining the relationship between sculpture and space in Bellum, it is necessary to reflect briefly on the notion of "mapping space" that informs the present analysis. Although the study of cartography has tended to focus on the production of maps or atlases—i.e. physical or visual rep resentations of space—the notion of mapping certainly encompasses much 61 Lee I. Levine, Judaism and Hellenism in Antiquity: Conflict or Confluence? (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1999). 7, On this perspective, see for example Erich Gruen, Heritage and Hellenism: The Reinven tiontion of Jewish Tradition (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998). 81 Although focusing primarily on Josephus' earliest composition, I will necessarily incor porate synoptic material from Antiquitates in order to underscore the unique emphases of Bellum.</page><page sequence="4">J. von Ehrenkrook /Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 170-191 173 more than such tangible relics.9 Indeed, recent research on the history of cartography has drawn attention to the cognitive processes involved in mapping space, shifting the emphasis from the physical reality of space— e.g. the precise dimensions of a particular geographical territory, the exact locations of its borders, etc.—to the interplay between person and place, to the way in which people perceive a particular spatial reality.10 As R. J. Zwi Werblowsky observes, "Landscape—whether macro-cosmography or local geography—is shaped, in the very act of our perceiving it, by our mindscape."" In one sense then, the encounter between person and place in cartogra phy is akin to the encounter between person and text. The mapping pro cess is fundamentally a hermeneutical activity, and the resulting "maps," whether inscribed in visual representations of space or embedded in narra tives about space, are intrinsically subjective and context determined. Of course, an individuals mental map is not drawn from thin air, as it were, but in some sense corresponds, however imperfectly, to the reality it pur ports to describe. The conceptual and corporeal are inextricably entwined, and peoples perceptions cannot be completely isolated from their physical context. Nevertheless, by examining the "imagined worlds" of such cogni tive maps, we can often catch a glimpse of the cartographer's own world, the context from which he or she conceptualizes space.12 In other words, cognitive maps are invaluable not simply to understand space itself but the people people who both inhabit and imagine space, and who mediate through their cognitive maps a particular understanding of themselves and their place in the world. It is precisely this dynamic that I wish to explore in the representation of space in Bellum. How is Josephus' portrayal of sacred space, and the " J.

Further, what is Josephus' cartographic strategy? In what way does his mapping of space function as a means of navigating the cultural terrain of Flavian Rome? Sculpture and the Mapping of Sacred Territory in Bellum A A good starting point for the study of sculpture and space in Bellum is the notorious Pontius Pilate and his troublesome military standards.13 At some point during his tenure as praefectus of Judea (26-36 C.E.),14 Pilate trans ferred from Caesarea Maritima to Jerusalem a garrison of troops for the winter.15 Neither Bellum nor Antiquitates states precisely where these troops were stationed, but the fortress Antonia at the northwest corner of the temple complex is a plausible suggestion.16 What is clear in both accounts 13' B.J. 2.169-174; A.J. 18.55-59. On this episode, see especially the following studies: Carl H. Kraeling, "The Episode of the Golden Standards at Jerusalem," HTR 35 (1942): 263 89; Daniel R. Schwartz, "Josephus and Philo on Pontius Pilate," in The Jerusalem Cathedra: Studies Studies in the History, Archaeology, Geography and Ethnography of the Land of Israel (ed. Lee I.I. Levine; Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1983), 26-45; Karl Jaros, In Sachen Pon tiustius Pilatus (Mainz am Rhein: von Zabern, 2002), 53-59. Krieger offers a brief synoptic analysis of this episode in order to demonstrate that A.J. 18-20 follows and revises the narrative of B.J. 2.117-283; see Klaus-Stefan Krieger, "A Synoptic Approach to Β 2:117 283 and A 18-20," in Internationales Josephus-Kolloquium Paris 2001: Studies on the Antiq uitiesuities ofjosephus (ed. Folker Siegert and Jiirgen U. Kalms; Miinster: LIT, 2001), 90-100, esp. 91-93■ 141 Kraeling argues that this event occurred in the fall of 26 C.E., during the first year of Pilate's tenure; see Kraeling, "Episode of the Golden Standards," 283. Daniel R. Schwartz rightly notes, however, that there is nothing in Josephus' accounts that requires a date at the beginning of Pilate's term; see Schwartz, "Josephus and Philo on Pontius Pilate," 32-33· ,5) Smallwood suggests that this was an act of "conscious provocation" intended to violate Jewish law, a fairly straightforward reading ofjosephus' own assessment of Pilate's motives; see E. Mary Smallwood, The Jews under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian (Leiden: Brill, 1976), 161. In contrast, Kraeling argues that although Pilate may be accused of igno ranee, it is likely that his actions were in line with the normal responsibilities of a Roman governor; see Kraeling, "Episode of the Golden Standards," 265-74. 161 Kraeling, "Episode of the Golden Standards," 279-80; Michael Grant, The Jews in the Roman Roman World (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1973), 100; Smallwood, Jews under Roman Rule,Roman Rule, 161;J0hn R.

In contrast, see Schwartz, "Josephus and Philo on Pontius Pilate," 33. Schwartz argues that Philo's</page><page sequence="6">J. von Ehrenkrook / Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 170-191 175 is that this action, because it involved the presence of military standards in Jerusalem, created a bit of a stir amongst certain members of the Jewish populace, who proceeded to petition before Pilate in Caesarea that the standards be removed. Initially, Pilate refused, but after much persistence, he eventually gave in to their demands, and the standards were removed and apparently returned to Caesarea. In both accounts, Josephus uses the Greek term σημαία, a variant spell ing of σημεία, to designate the offending object.17 This word is typical in Greek for Roman military standards of all types, corresponding with the generic use of the Latin signum.1s There were at least four main types of Roman standards: (1) the aquila, a golden eagle mounted on a pole, which was considered the special sign for Roman legions;19 (2) the imago, which could include either representations of animals or of the emperor (impera torumtorum imagines) mounted on top of a pole;20 (3) the signum, which con sisted of a spear-head (or sometimes crowned with a human hand) and pole adorned with phalerae, round discs that could be either iconic (embossed with an image of the emperor or a deity) or aniconic, among account of the idolatrous shields introduced by Pilate in Herod's palace (Legat. 299-305) is an alternative and apologetic version of the incident involving the standards in Josephus. He suggests that Philos account, although more biased and thus less reliable on the whole, accurately specifies that the incident occurred in Herod's palace. 171 According to Niese's critical apparatus, the epitome that stands behind the twelfth century Chronicon of Zonaras, dating probably to the tenth or eleventh century, reads τοις σημείοις instead of ταΐς σημαίαις in A.J. 15.55; see Benedict Niese, ed., Flavii Josephi Opera Opera (7 vols.; Berlin: Weidmann, 1885-95), 4:150. 181 Kraeling identifies two uses of signum with reference to military standards: the first as a generic term applying to any or all types of Roman standards; the second as a specific type of standard; see Kraeling, "Episode of the Golden Standards," 269-70. !" Pliny the Elder, Nat. 10.5. Pliny lists the aquila along with four other theriomorphic standards—wolves, minotaurs, horses, and boars—each corresponding to different ranks within a legion. On the aquila, see Michael P.

This description would perhaps seem to fit best with the imperatorum imagines,11 but the widely used iconic signasigna could also be in view here.24 In any case, the critical issue for this discussion is that the standards were iconic, containing anthropomorphic sculptural representations, whether embossed or three-dimensional, and both accounts agree that it is the iconic nature of the standards at the cen ter of this dispute. Beyond this superficial agreement, however, the two narratives depart considerably on the purported reasons that the iconic standards were a violation of Jewish law.25 This becomes clear when we compare Josephus' summary of the second commandment in each account. On the one hand, in Bellum Josephus remarks that Pilate's actions "trampled upon" Jewish law, since "it is not lawful to set up an image in the city" (ουδέν γαρ άξιοΰσιν έν τη πόλει δείκηλον τίθεσθαι).26 However in Antiquitates the standards 211 Kraeling, "Episode of the Golden Standards," 270. A funerary relief from Mainz shows a signifer, a standard-bearer, holding a signum with six aniconic phalerae■, see Yann le Bohec, The Imperial Roman Army The Imperial Roman Army (London: Batsford, 1994), pi. 5.8.

Rostovtzeff, " Vexillum and Victory," JRS 32 (1942): 92-106. 231 Roth, "Ordinance against Images," 170. Thackeray likewise identifies these as imperato rum rum imagines in the notes of his Loeb translation (Thackeray, LCL, 389). 24' Kraeling, "Episode of the Golden Standards," 273. Kraeling considers it unlikely that a single infantry or cavalry unit would have more than one imaginifer (the soldier who car ried the imperatorum imagines), and Josephus clearly speaks of standards in the plural. He thus argues that iconic signa are more likely in view here, given the smaller size of the unit and the fact that this type of standard was much more diffuse throughout the various units of the Roman army. 251 For more on the differences between these two accounts, see Krieger, "A Synoptic Approach," 91-93. 261 B.J. 2.170, emphasis mine. Unless otherwise noted, translations of primary sources are mine.</page><page sequence="8">J. von Ehrenkrook / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 39 (2008) 170-191 177 are a violation because "our law forbids the making of images" (εικόνων ποίησιν άπαγορεύοντος ήμΐν τοΰ νόμου).27 The difference between the two legal explanations should be obvious. Whereas in Bellum the second com mandment becomes a prohibition against images within a certain spatial delimitation, in this instance, the city of Jerusalem, in Antiquitates the law is more directly a prohibition against the image itself. What are we to make of this discrepancy? On the surface, this detail may seem inconsequential, perhaps even pedantic, and one approach is to simply gloss over or harmonize the difference.28 After all, the two legal explanations are not necessarily incompatible. Obviously, if the image itself is prohibited, as seems to be the case in Antiquitates, then its intru sion into Judean space would be especially troublesome. Yet, as I hope to demonstrate in the following, there is good reason to believe that the dis tinct emphasis in Bellums version of this episode—i.e. the link between sculpture and space—is more intentional, functioning as part of a larger rhetorical strategy.29 A closer look at this episode within the wider narrative context of Bellum Bellum indicates that Josephus consistently plays up the issue of space in his treatment of the second commandment. As with the episode of Pilate's standards, Josephus' synoptic portrayal of the iconoclastic reaction to Herod's eagle includes two different legal explanations.30 In Bellum, the 27&gt; A.J. 18.55. 281 Gutmann's discussion of this episode assumes wrongly that the summary of the law in A.J. 18.55—a prohibition against making images—is likewise found in B.J. 2.170; see Gutmann, "The 'Second Commandment,'" 171. Rajak, in her discussion of the Pilate incident, observes this distinction between the two narratives, though for her, the discrep ancy merely "suggests a lack of conviction on the author's part." Although she does not explain precisely what is meant by this, I presume it has something to do with Josephus' own views on the second commandment, specifically that he equivocates on the meaning of this law and thus betrays an uncertainty as to how it should be interpreted; see Tessa Rajak,Rajak, Josephus: The Historian and His Society (Philadelphia; Fortress Press, 1984), 67. 291 This is not to imply that the version in Antiquitates is somehow less rhetorical and more historically reliable. Indeed, although a detailed treatment of the iconoclastic narratives within the compositional context of Antiquitates is well beyond the scope of this essay, I believe an exploration of the "poetics of idolatry" in this text would be equally fruitful. 301 For a recent study of this episode, see Jan Willem van Henten, "Ruler or God? The Demolition of Herod's Eagle," in The New Testament and Early Christian Literature in Greco-Roman Greco-Roman Context: Studies in Honor of David E. Aune (ed. John Fotopoulos; Leiden; Brill, 2006), 257-86.</page><page sequence="9">178 J. von Ehrenkrook /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 170-191 problematic nature of the statue is again directly tied to its location: the eagle was set up "in the temple" (κατά τον ναόν), an act that was "contrary to the laws of their country."31 In Antiquitates however, the problem is that an image was made, regardless of its location, again shifting the stress from the place to the ποίησις of the statue.32 Josephus' treatment of the infamous incident involving Caligula's statue (39/40 C.E.) adds an additional layer to this discourse, one that highlights how statuary in Bellum functions as a kind of mapping device, a boundary marker delineating the sacred from the profane. Although in both narra tives Caligula's actions are viewed as a potential desecration of sacred territory, in Bellum we can observe a more pronounced emphasis on the relationship between sculpture and Judean space, in particular, the way in which the former defines the latter. Embedded in the exchange between the Jews and Publius Petronius, the governor of Syria who was ordered to carry out Caligula's demands, is a configuration of space into two distinct realms: the territory of the Jews, wherein statues of gods and men are for bidden not only within the temple but even "within any random place in the countryside" (έν έικαίφ τινι τόπφ της χώρας), and the rest of the Roman world, wherein "all the subjected nations had erected the images of Caesar along with the other gods in their cities."33 What emerges in these narratives then, and indeed throughout Bellum, is a vision of Jerusalem, and to a certain extent all Judea, as a sculpture-less haven in a sculpture-filled world. Indeed, the very sanctity of the temple, city, and even its chora is marked by its emptiness, by its lack of sculpted art, or even more broadly, any figurative art. Within this conceptual frame work, the second commandment becomes not so much a prohibition against images of other gods, or even the Jewish god, but a prohibition against any kind of sculptural representation within Judean territory. This feature in Bellum, incidentally, explains a rather puzzling discrep ancy in Josephus' two descriptions of the temple porticoes.34 The lavish 31&gt; B.J. 1.650. 32י A.J. 17.150-151. Van Henten observes the emphasis on space in Bellum but ultimately harmonizes the two accounts, placing this episode among the many indications that some Jews, including Josephus, interpreted the second commandment in its strictest possible sense, i.e. as a prohibition against all images of living creatures; see Van Henten, "Ruler or God?" 276-78. 331 B.J. 2.194-195. }4) B.J. 5.190-191; A/. 15.414-416; see the discussion of these passages in Th. A. Busink,</page><page sequence="10">J. von Ehrenkrook / Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 170-191 179 portrayal of this structure in Antiquitates includes a remark that the capi tals were carved in a Corinthian style (κιονοκράνων αύτοΐς κατά τον Κορίνθιον τρόπον έπεξειργασμένων γλυφαΐς), and further, that the ceilings within the porticoes "were adorned with wood carvings in all kinds of shapes" (αί δ' όροφαι ξύλοις έξήσκηντο γλυφαΐς πολυτρόποις σχημάτων ίδέαις). In fact, this reference to γλυφαί on the columns and ceilings of the porticoes fits what can be observed in the scant archaeological remains of the temple complex. Several rock fragments from the vaulted ceilings of the tunnels that ascended from the Hulda Gates to the esplanade have been discovered, containing carvings of geometric and floral motifs.35 Sim ilarly, the remains of a capital found near the Western Wall ,contain Corin thian and Ionic features.36 So it is reasonable to suppose that the description in Antiquitates corresponds more or less to the actual structure. Yet a com pletely different impression would emerge if we only had the description in Bellum to go by. In fact, Josephus goes out of his way to emphasize that the porticoes were a noteworthy spectacle (θεωρίαν άξιόλογον) in part because of the absence of γλυφαί. The wood ceilings are said to have been simple recessed panels (φάτνωμα),37 with no mention of the ornamenta tion described in Antiquitates. Josephus instead emphasizes the natural beauty of the structure (φυσική πολυτέλεια), seemingly implying that its magnificence was not due to the skill of craftsmen, and he explicitly denies that there were any kind of artistic representations within the porticoes, whether painted (ζωγραφία) or sculpted (γλυφίς). It seems rather odd that Josephus, a Jew from a priestly family who undoubtedly walked the halls of the temple porticoes on numerous occa sions, would seem confused on this point. To state the matter succinctly: why the discrepancy if Josephus had first-hand knowledge of the appear ance of this structure? This is the crux of the matter. I submit that Josephus is not confused in this instance, but that the description in Bellum, however DerDer Tempel von Jerusalem von Salomo bis Herod.es: eine archdologisch-historische Studie unter Beriicksichtigung desBeriicksichtigung des westsemitischen Tempelbaus (2 vols.; Leiden: Brill, 1970-1980), 2:1218-19. 351 Meir Ben-Dov, In the Shadow of the Temple: The Discovery of Ancient Jerusalem (trans.

Indeed, this description underscores an important leitmotif in Bellum: Judea, Jerusalem, and especially the temple complex, represent a place—a sacred territory—without sculpture of any type, even seemingly innocuous geometric and floral carvings. Josephus in effect offers the reader of Bellum an imagined world, a sculpture-less haven in a world full of γλυφαί. Returning to the episode of Pilate's standards, a closer examination of the structural and linguistic links between this pericope and the subse quent story of Pilate's construction of the aqueduct with funds from the sacred treasury further confirms the centrality of space in Bellum.38 In the episode of the standards, the offended party petitions before Pilate that the standards be removed from Jerusalem, a confrontation that takes place in in in Caesarea. The Jews appear before the tribunal of Pilate in the stadium, where he orders his soldiers "to surround the Jews" (κυκλώσασθαι τους Ιουδαίους), forming a ring of troops three deep (περίστασης δε τριστιχεί της φάλαγγος).39 The response to Pilate's use of the sacred treasury for the construction of the aqueduct is similar, except in this instance the confron tation with Pilate takes place in Jerusalem. Whereas the version of this event in Antiquitates states only that the Jews assembled (συνέρχομαι) before Pilate in protest,40 in Bellum Josephus carries forward the language from the previous pericope, i.e. the episode of the standards, only in this case it is the Jews who form a ring around Pilate (περιστάντες τό βήμα).41 The language here, and in particular, the image of a power shift according to location—the Jews encircled in Caesarea; Pilate encircled in Jerusalem— vividly illustrates the politics of space that stands at the core of my argu ment. Caesarea in this narrative represents the territory of the other, in this case Pilate, and Jerusalem the opposite. In other words, there is in the jux taposition of these two Pilate episodes a subtle mapping of space, a delin eation of two realms that corresponds in part with the presence or absence of sculpture.

According to Josephus, a conflict erupted in Caesarea between the Jew ish and Syrian/Greek inhabitants of the city, setting in motion, at least in Josephus' narrative progression, a series of events that would lead to the Jewish revolt and ultimately the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. Verbal sparring became riotous, and, according to the account in Antiqui tates,tates, this civic conflict eventually took on "the shape of war" (έν πολέμου τρόπφ γενομένην).44 Initially, the Jewish contingent appeared to emerge from the fray victorious, although Felix, the procurator of Judea during this time, turned the tide by authorizing his troops to attack and plunder the Jewish residents of Caesarea. The conflict continued until Felix referred the matter to Nero, at which time the Syrian/Greek contingent was awarded preeminence in 66 C.E., immediately prior to the commencement of the revolt against Rome. Josephus then reports that the entire Jewish commu nity in Caesarea—some 20,000 members strong—was decimated during the revolt.45 Two unique features in the narrative of Bellum are relevant to the topic at hand. First, after initially identifying the opponents as "Syrians" (Σύροι), Josephus subsequently refers to this group as "Greeks" (Έλληνες). This Pausanias; see Jas Eisner, Art and the Roman Viewer: The Transformation of Art from the Pagan Pagan World to Christianity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 136-37. 431 B.J. 2.266-270; A.]. 20.173-178.

Sec ond, the dispute in Bellum concerns not the juridical status of the Jews vis-a-vis their non-Jewish antagonists (the isopoliteia question that is at the center of the dispute in Antiquitates),46 but rather the very identity of the city itself—whether Jewish or Greek—and ultimately to whom the city belongs. This is apparent in both the claim of the disputing parties and the evidence adduced to support each claim: For [the Jews] considered the city to be their own, claiming that the city's founder, Herod the king, had been a Jew. Now their opponents admitted that the founder was Jewish, but claimed that the city itself belonged to the Greeks. For whoever would set up statues and temples in it would not then present the city to the Jews.47 As noted above, what is at stake in this text is not status within the polis but the identity of the polis, and the presence or absence of statuary emerges as the primary criterion for defining this identity. I am admittedly skeptical that the account in Bellum bears any substantial similarity to the events that took place, as if the Jews of Caesarea were really trying, in the words of Lee Levine, "to turn Caesarea into a 'Jewish' city."48 Rather, this incident filtered through Josephan rhetoric creates an opposition between two realms—the territory of the Έλλήνες and the 'Ιουδαίοι—and in the pro cess transforms what was likely an incident of social unrest between rival Semitic groups into a veritable clash of civilizations, the Jews struggling against the irrepressible Greeks.49 That this narrative identifies statuary as the quintessence of Caesarea's "Greekness" further implies the inverse: a "Jewish" Caesarea must be a statue-less Caesarea. The use of statuary to map identity is widely attested in Greek literature. As early as Herodotus, statues (along with temples and altars) served to distinguish between the Greeks and the Persians, whose sacred territory 46) A.J. 20.173: Γίνεται δε και των Καισάρειαν οίκούντων 'Ιουδαίων στάσις προς τους έν αύτη Σΰρους περί ισοπολιτείας (Now a dispute concerning isopoliteia arose among the Jews living in Caesarea against the Syrians in the city). 471 B.J. 2.266. 481 Levine, "Jewish-Greek Conflict," 396. 491 On the use of ethnic terminology in Josephus, see Tessa Rajak, "Greeks and Barbarians in Josephus," in Hellenism in the Land of Israel (ed.

Pausanias' own stated purpose of his narrative was to "set out in detail πάντα τά Ελληνικά,"51 which on the surface would seem to suggest that the Periegesis Hellados Hellados was intended as a kind of tourist's guidebook, an exhaustive map of mainland Greece as seen in Pausanias' day.52 Yet a closer reading of this work makes it clear that the scope of πάντα is actually quite limited.53 Pausanias frequently omits prominent civic structures in the urban land scape, often of Roman origin, in favor of monuments that he deems most important, guiding his reader toward "religious landmarks,"54 foremost of which are statues, and in the process, shaping a vision of Greece and "Greekness,"55 summed up in the term Ελληνικά, that is defined in part by these monuments of piety.56 Pausanias' description of the famed sanctuary of the Olympian Zeus exemplifies the use of statues as "signs of orientation" delineating between 50, Herodotus, Hist. 1.131-132; see also Jonathan M. Hall, Hellenicity: Between Ethnicity and and Culture (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2002), 192. 511 Pausanias, Descr. 1.26.4. 521 So the Loeb translation of this passage: "But my narrative must not loiter, as my task is a general description of all Greece" (Jones, LCL).

A survey of θέας άξιον in Book 1 (Attica)(Attica) of the Periegesis Hellados reveals a remarkable interest in sacred landmarks, espe daily consecrated statues. Of the nineteen appearances of this phrase in Attica, twelve are used in reference to statues, and the remaining occurrences, with the possible exception of two, point toward noteworthy temples, sacred groves or caves, and other similarly cultic locations and structures.</page><page sequence="15">184 J. von Ehrenkrook / Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 170-191 the sacred and the profane.57 The strategic placement of statuary at the entrance to and within the precinct provides the reader a map of this par ticular site that includes not only its precise measurements—the limits of which are said to be about four stades—but also visual boundary markers that signal precisely when the reader, or pilgrim, has entered this sacred terrain.58 Moreover, what is true on a smaller scale in the numerous sane tuaries throughout Greece is also true on a much larger scale: entire cities are inhabited by an impressive population of statuary, a physical reality that for Pausanias bespeaks not only the sanctity of apolis but also the piety of its inhabitants.59 Thus, what emerges from the Periegesis Hellados is actu ally not Greece as seen in Pausanias' day but "Greekness" as Pausanias wanted wanted it to be seen. Encapsulated in his "visual theology" of Greece is the perception that statuary signals the presence of the sacred, marking out this territory as a locus consecratus and its people as a populus piissimus.60 57) Pausanias, Descr. 1.18.6.

Yaron Z. Eliav et al.; Leuven: Peeters, forthcoming). 58) The question of whether or not Pausanias' intended this work as a guide book for reli gious pilgrimage has been the subject of much scholarly debate. Eisner is the most vocal proponent of the identification of Pausanias not as a pedantic antiquarian but as a devout religious pilgrim; see, most notably, Jas' Eisner, "Pausanias: A Greek Pilgrim in the Roman World," Past and Present 135 (1992): 3-29.

On the phenomenon of pilgrimage in the Greco-Roman world, see also the collection of essays in Eisner and Rutherford, eds., Pilgrimage in Graeco Roman Roman and Early Christian Antiquity: Seeing the Gods. In contrast with this view of Pausa nias, Frazer describes Pausanias' intentions as "mainly antiquarian" and the Periegesis HelladosHellados as recording "little more than the antiquities of the country and the religious tradi tions and ritual of the people"; see James G.

Whereas Pausanias' notion of Greek space and identity is defined by the numerous statues populating its landscape, Josephus inverts this paradigm in order to map a world and identity without sculpture.62 Space, Power and Cultural Politics in Flavian Rome We have seen in the above discussion how sculpture in Bellum, and in particular narratives about Jewish resistance to sculpture, plays an impor tant role in defining Judean (sacred) territory and shaping Jewish identity as distinct from Greek space and identity. Building on recent scholarship emphasizing the importance of Josephus' Roman context,63 I will now consider how this literary topos of sculpture, space and identity is both shaped by and contributes to a discourse on culture and power in Flavian Rome. Specifically, I wish to suggest that Josephus' configuration of space 61) peter stewart&gt; Statues in Roman Society: Representation and Response (Oxford: Oxford Uni versity Press, 2003), 276. Although Stewart uses this phrase to explain the practice of damna tiotio memoriae, seeing it as a "negation of the symbolism" of imperial authority, I believe it aptly applies to Josephus' own inversion of Greco-Roman perceptions of statuary. 621 I am not suggesting, of course, that there is some kind of literary relationship between Josephus and Pausanias. Rather, the evidence suggests a common "culture of perception"— they are breathing the same cultural air, so to speak; see Richard D. Leppert, Art and the Com mittedmitted Eye: The Cultural Functions of Imagery (Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press, 1996), 11. 631 See especially the following articles and collections of essays: Steve Mason, "Flavius Josephus in Flavian Rome: Reading on and between the Lines," in Flavian Rome: Culture, Image,Image, Text (ed.

Mason's contribution in the latter volume addresses the specific question of intended audience for Bellum, arguing for a local and social process of dissemination primarily directed toward a "sophisticated Roman audience," i.e. primarily Roman literary elites living within the capital; see Steve Mason, "Of Audience and Meaning: Reading Josephus' Bellum Judaicum in the Context of a Flavian Audience," in Josephus and Jewish History in Flavian Rome and Beyond, 71 -100 at 99.</page><page sequence="17">186 J. von Ehrenkrook /Journalfor the Study of fudaism 39 (2008) 170-191 and identity, his "sacred map" as it were, beyond playing an integral role in his treatment of the politics of power in Judea during the revolt against Rome, functions to navigate the complicated cultural and political terrain in in Rome following the turbulent rise of a new imperial family. A decade after the devastating destruction of the temple, Josephus invites his Roman reader to consider through this iconography of space the limits of monar chy, and to define and distinguish between tyrannical rule and legitimate expressions of power. Although writing in the latter half of the second century C.E., Pausanias again offers an interesting point of comparison.64 According to Jas Eisner, Pausanias' vision of Ελληνικά, tangibly evident in the monuments that mark out its sanctity, functions in part "as a resistance to the realities of Roman rule."65 In other words, embedded in Pausanias' visual map of Greece is an attempt to chart the proper boundaries of power and author ity in a context where such boundaries have seemingly been violated. This is exemplified in his discussion of the bronze Eros erected in Thespiae, wherein Pausanias displays his own ambivalence toward Roman hegemony. Gaius Caligula initially stole this unfortunate statue, which Claudius even tually returned to its happy home, only to meet a devastating end at the hands of Nero, who brought the statue back to Rome where it perished by fire.66 This brief account of the travails of Eros conveys an implicit assess ment of imperial power, which is measured according to its treatment of sacred space. Power rightly displayed respects the sacred boundaries; con versely, the quintessential mark of abusive and tyrannical power is the vio lation of such boundaries and the desecration of the sacred. Both Caligula and Nero, by removing the statue from its rightful home, desecrated the territory of the Thespians and thus "sinned against the god" (των δε άσεβησάντων ές τον θεόν).67 Only Claudius displays a proper use of power by respecting the sacred boundaries of the Greeks. It is interesting that Josephus too charts the proper boundaries of power and authority according to his sacred map, and even places Gaius Caligula on this map, only in this case it is not the removal but intrusion of a statue 64י Ewin Bowie, "Inspiration and Aspiration: Date, Genre, and Readership," in Pausanias: Travel Travel and Memory in Roman Greece (ed.

Herod, Pilate and especially Caligula exemplify the dangers of tyranny in their attempts to remap Judea, as it were, to reconfigure Judean space according to the indicia of Greek space. We should note, however, that by highlighting the polluting potential of Greek culture and its links with tyranny, Josephus is not simply expressing a distinctly Jewish concern to preserve cultural "orthodoxy" from the cor rupting forces of "Hellenism." Rather, I believe Josephus here is addressing a growing "hellenophobia" within certain segments of the Roman elite, expressed most poignantly in Juvenile's lament over a "Greekified Rome" {Graecam{Graecam Urbem).68 Plutarch conveys this Roman ambivalence toward Greek culture when he places in the mouth of Marcus Cato the sentiment that "Rome would lose her empire when she had become infected with Greek letters."69 Though recounting the words of an austere defender of the Roman Repub lie from bygone years, Plutarch may very well testify to a simmering angst within his own day.70 For many in Rome during and even after the Flavian dynasty, the memory of Nero's philhellenism still lingered; after all, this tyrant, widely considered to have been enslaved to his Greek passions, was to a large degree responsible for the demise of the Julio-Claudians and the subsequent civil wars that plagued Rome.71 From this perspective, 681 The full citation is as follows: "The race that's now most popular with wealthy Romans— the people I want especially to get away from—I'll name them right away, without any embarrassment. My fellow-citizens, I cannot stand a Greekified Rome" (Sat. 3.60-61 [Braund, LCL]). 691 Plutarch, Cato Maj. 23.2-3 (Perrin, LCL). It should be noted that Plutarch is quick to refute this assertion by commenting that Rome at its zenith "made every form of Greek learning and culture her own." For Plutarch, Greekness and Romanness were perfectly compatible, and his own literary project in some sense functioned as a "bridge between Greece and Rome"; see S. C. R. Swain, "Hellenic Culture and the Roman Heroes of Plutarch,"Plutarch," JHSPlutarch," JHS 110 (1990): 126-45 at 127. 701 In contrast, Henrichs argues that after the second century B.C.E., the perceived threat of Greek culture had all but dissipated in Rome; see Albert Henrichs," Graecia Capta: Roman Views of Greek Culture," Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 97 (1995): 243-61. 711 According to Holly Haynes, Tacitus' treatment of Nero reflects the perspective that Nero was a fountain head of innumerable political crises; see Holly Haynes, The History of Make-Believe:Make-Believe: Tacitus on Imperial Rome (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003), 34. On the question of Nero's philhellenism, Whitmarsh remarks: "according to the conven tional picture, Nero's celebrated philhellenism inclines more to the seedier side of the Greek heritage, or at least what Roman Hellenophobes represented as such"; see Tim Whitmarsh, "Greek and Roman in Dialogue: The Pseudo-Lucianic Nero "JHS 119 (1999): 142-60 at</page><page sequence="19">188 J. von Ehrenkrook / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 170-191 Greekness becomes a kind of measuring stick for imperial illegitimacy: the more an emperor displays his proximity to the more excessive elements of Greek culture—sexual license, luxuria, and the general inability to govern desires—the more that emperor demonstrates an abusive and tyrannical reign. In short, Greek-ness run amok leads to power run amok. The intersection between desecrating sacrilege, tyranny and Greek cul ture is most poignantly expressed in Josephus' portrayal of the Jewish reb els. Throughout Bellum, Josephus juxtaposes the Roman protection of sacred space with the rebels' penchant for desecration.72 This topos receives greater specificity in John of Gischala and his band of zealots, who emerge in Bellum as a locus of desecrating tyranny: But when the plunder from the people dried up, John turned to sacrilege (ίεροσυλίαν)—he melted down many of the temple's votive offerings and numerous vessels required for proper worship, such as the bowls and plates and tables. Nor did he abstain from the vessels for pure wine sent by Augustus and his wife. For indeed Roman emperors continually honored and adorned the temple, in contrast with this Jew, who pulled down even these donations from foreigners.73 The image of unbridled greed, of an unrestrained pursuit of wealth even at the expense of one's compatriots and god, underscores the leitmotif out lined above: tyranny knows no bounds or limits, only excessive lust mani fest in abusive displays of power. That the apex of tyranny resides not in some foreign invader but within the 'Ιουδαίοι is for Josephus a lamentable paradox.74 145. See also the image of Nero in Suetonius, who repeatedly highlights the emperors depraved (at least from the perspective of the author) obsession with all things Greek (Sue tonius, Vit. Nero 12.3; 20.1-3; 28.2). 721 See for example Titus' numerous attempts to preserve Jerusalem and its temple (B.J. 1.10, 27-28). Similarly, Roman donations to the temple are juxtaposed with the spoils taken by Jewish rebels {B.J. 4.181-182). According to Mason, the portrait ofTitus' clemency should be read as an ironic ploy, a kind of double-speak whose surface praise masks a subtle critique of of the Flavian imperator and princeps; see Steve Mason, "Figured Speech and Irony in T. Flavius Josephus," in Flavins Josephus and Flavian Rome, 243-88 at 262-67. Whether or not Josephus engages in a form of "safe criticism" in the pro-Flavian material, the image of Titus' clemency seems to be integral to this wider discourse on space and power. 73) B.J. 5.562-563. 74' Josephus laments της παραδόξου μεταβολής την πόλιν, when foreigners (αλλόφυλοι) and enemies (πολέμιοι) must reverse the impiety of Jews (B.J. 6.102).</page><page sequence="20">J. von Ehrenkrook / Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 170-191 189 One of the more revealing instances of this paradox of impiety is found in a rather colorful, if unlikely, depiction of the aforementioned John (identified in the immediate context as a τύραννος) and his rebel followers: Now their lust for plunder was insatiable, and they ransacked the homes of the rich; they amused themselves in the murder of men and the abuse of women; they drank down their spoils along with blood, and in their insolence they behaved like women (ένεθηλυπαθέω) with reckless abandon, adorning their hair and putting on feminine clothing, bathing themselves in perfume and painting their eyelids for beauty. Moreover, not only did they beautify themselves [like women], but they even imitated the [sexual] passions of women (πάθη γυναικών έμιμοΰντο), and through their excessive debauchery they contrived illicit sexual pleasures (δι' ύπερβολήν άσελγείας αθέμιτους έπενόησαν έρωτας); and immersing themselves [in sexual decadence] as if in a brothel in the city, they defiled the entire city with their impure deeds.75 If nothing else, this image of a blood-drenched sexual rampage, a murder ous raping of women and city, indicates in no uncertain terms who the villain is in Bellum. We should not, of course, naively suppose that Jose phus' description bears any resemblance to the historical figures portrayed in this pericope. Rather, the hyperbolic language here echoes Roman ste reotypes of Greek decadence, which in turn serve as a point of contrast with Roman ideals of moderation and masculinity.76 That Roman moralists associated excessive displays of libido with Greek influence is well documented,77 and certainly the above text comports with the image of Greek licentiousness that we find in authors such as Cicero and Tacitus.78 But even more explicitly, Josephus' caricature of effeminacy and sexual passivity recalls a longstanding unease with Roman men who 75י B.J. 4.560-562. 761 On masculine identity in ancient Rome, see Maud W.

Michael Grant and Rachel Kitzinger; 3 vols.; New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1988), 1265-78. 781 For example, Cicero, Tusc. 4.70; 5-58; Tacitus, Ann. 14.20. Tacitus explicitly refers to an "imported licentiousness" whose source is clearly Greece in the broader context (Jackson, LCL).</page><page sequence="21">190 J. von Ehrenkrook / Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 170-191 behave like women. The second-century B.C.E. Scipio negatively describes P. Sulpicius Gallus as "one who daily perfumes himself and dresses before a mirror, whose eyebrows are trimmed, who walks abroad with beard plucked out and thighs made smooth."79 Tacitus similarly depicts among the vices of Otho his penchant for cross-dressing: "Was it by his bearing and gait or by his womanish dress (muliebri ornatu) that he deserved the throne?"80 Likewise, Roman distaste for male receptivity in the sexual act, expressed in the hierarchical distinction between the penetrator, the embodiment of Roman manliness, and the penetrated (i.e. young boys, slaves and women) is well known, exemplified in Martial's repeated cen sure of male passivity.81 Such effeminate practices were considered part and parcel of the more general problem of sexual decadence imported from Greece into the capital.82 I propose that the Josephan rhetoric outlined in the above analysis, in particular the attempt to mediate the nexus of tyranny, sacrilege and Greek culture through the configuration of sacred space, should be read in the light of this lively discourse on culture and politics in Rome. Josephus here gives voice to certain elite Roman attitudes toward virtue, power and Roman identity that serves both to elicit a sympathetic hearing and to 751 Preserved in Aulus Gellius' second-century C.E. Noctium Atticarum 6.12.2; trans. Mac Mullen, "Roman Attitudes to Greek Love," 484. 801 Tacitus, Hist. 1.30 (Moore, LCL). We could also point to the writings of the poet Pha edrus and satirist Juvenile, who, according to Hallett, "provide negative and feminizing representations of mature men"; see Judith P. Hallett, "Female Homoeroticism and the Denial of Roman Reality in Latin Literature," Yale Journal of Criticism 3 (1989): 209-27 at 223. 8" See the numerous references cited in J. P. Sullivan, "Martial's Sexual Attitudes," Philolo gusgus 123 (1979): 288-302, at 294, n. 10. Sullivan argues that, notwithstanding Martial's own preference for young boys, his occasional rendezvous with prostitutes, and the frank and uninhibited tone of his epigrams, Martial is on the whole "fairly conventional, if not prudish, in his sexual values" (302). In this light, we should note that it is not male-to-male intercourse per se that is considered immoral, so long as the participants fulfill their proper roles. Moreover, that some Roman moralists decry male receptivity should not be taken to mean that all Romans rejected homosexual love between two adult males, as if we could even speak of the Roman view of sex. For an attempt to uncover other voices in Roman sexuality, see John R. Clarke, Roman Sex, 100 B.C.-A.D. 250 (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 2003).

Of course, Josephus is writing in Greek to a liter ate audience fluent in Greek, so it is not Greek culture per se that is prob lematic, only an excessive infatuation with Greek culture. On this point, I submit, such sentiments would certainly have rung true to a moralizing impulse among at least a few members of the literary elite in Flavian Rome. Conclusion The importance of context should be clear in the above analysis, both the compositional context of the so-called iconoclastic narratives and the socio-politico-cultural context in which these narratives were composed. Josephus does indeed depict a tumultuous relationship between Jews and sculpture, but the distinct portrait of aniconism that emerges within BellumBellum vis-a-vis Antiquitates should caution against a straightforward read ing of this material. This is not to suggest that there exists a vast and impassable chasm between Josephan rhetoric and reality. The scant archae ological remains of figurative art in Second Temple Jerusalem,83 combined with the literary testimony of Josephus and Philo, as well as several non Jewish Greek and Latin authors,84 perhaps suggest, at the very least, an ambivalent, even uneasy attitude toward figurative representation for many Jews (though surely not all) during this period. Nevertheless, Josephus reconfigures this uneasy relationship for a distinctly Roman audience, con veying through this aniconic rhetoric of Bellum not simply a radically strict interpretation of the second commandment but the strategy of a cartogra pher whose sacred map serves to navigate the complex cultural and politi cal terrain of Flavian Rome. So it seems, in the end, that Venus has indeed cast her long shadow on Josephus. 831 Rachel Hachlili, Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology in the Land of Israel (Leiden: Brill, 1988). 841 For example, the fourth-century B.C.E.
