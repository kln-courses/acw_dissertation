<plain_text><page sequence="1">Writing "Frankly": Pound's Rhetoric Against Science Kathryne V. Lindberg Paris is the laboratory of ideas; it is there that poisons can be tested and new modes of sanity be discovered. It is there that the antiseptic conditions of the laboratory exist. That is the function of Paris. It was particularly the function of Remy de Gourmont. Ezra Pound, 1915' Conquerir I'Am6ricain n'est pas sans doute votre seul but. Le but de Mercure a 6t6 de permettre &amp; ceux qui en valent la peine d'ecrire franchement ce qu'ils pensent-seul plaisir d'un ecrivain. Cela doit aussi etre le votre. Remy de Gourmont, 19152 "Franchement d'6crire ce qu'on pense, seul plaisir d'un 6crivain." "To put down one's thought frankly, a writer's one pleasure." That phrase was the center of Gourmont's position. . . . 'Franchement, Frankly, is Frenchly,' if one may drag in philology. Ezra Pound, 19153 405</page><page sequence="2">I Both literary critics and scientists have dismissed Remy de Gourmont as a dilettante, a sort of real-life Bouvard who collected, classified, and usually (con)fused already digested philosophy into questionable "literary" notions. Yet he was Pound's ideal humanist, an inspired guide: "From Gourmont there proceeded a personal, living force.'Force' is almost a misnomer; let me call it a personal light" (SP, p. 413). Pound was to invoke this "force" against the national, historical, and generic definitions of more than one literary "orthodoxy." Gourmont, whose only official jobs were that of assistant librarian at the Biblioteque Nationale and literary editor of the newspaper Mercure de France, seems an unlikely culture hero. Yet as late as 1929, Pound stressed Gourmont's importance as a "type," and symbol of intellectual freedom: "We cannot afford to lose sight of his value, his significance as a type, a man standing for freedom and honesty of thought.... how many well-known and so called 'critical' writers pass their whole lives in, and how many entire periodicals are given over to the production of statements agreeable to editors... but having nothing whatever to do with thought, civilization, or honesty" (my italics).4 Thought, civilization, and honesty, all approbatory terms open to polemical interpretation, are the main Gourmontian qualities Pound emulated in his attempts to humanize literary America by reforming its periodicals and university curricula. Pound employed Gourmont's rhetorical strategy of "dissociation" against the terms of Eliot's orthodoxy. And Gourmont's "thought" is equally instrumental in Pound's attempts to bridge science and poetry, American and European, and thus to join all the categories of literary history, if not to fuse them into a "totalitarian" humanism.5 Unable to cite either a literary or scientific "masterpiece" to justify his claims for Gourmont, Pound erects diffuseness of thought into a criterion of literary greatness, even a criticism of literary history, shared by Pound's (revised versions of) the most important canonical poet-critics: The man was infused through his work. If you "hold a pistol to my head" and say: "Produce the master- piece on which you base these preposterous claims for De Gourmont!" I might not be able to lay out an array of books equal to those of his elder friend, Anatole France.... You, on the other hand, would be in very much the same fix if you were commanded suddenly to produce the basis of your respect for De Quincey or Coleridge. (SP, p. 413) Thus Pound's incorporation of Gourmont into the literary or critical canon involves the questioning of canonization. He argues that Gourmont's style, which is finer in the philosophical fragments than the poems, is not an end in itself, but a stimulant to (further) reading 406</page><page sequence="3">as well as a scientific-or poetic-revolution against philosophical abstraction: "Gourmont arouses the senses of the imagination, preparing the mind for receptivities. His wisdom, if not of the senses, is at any rate via the senses. We base our 'science' on perceptions, but our ethics have not yet attained this palpable basis" (LE, p. 345). Gourmont did not, in fact, offer an ethical system-nor any other for that matter; instead, he interrogated System. And, as Pound's metaphors suggest, he practiced-and at the same time analyzed-a "physiological style," intentionally reminiscent of Nietzsche and de Sade. This essay will consider Pound's adoption of Gourmont's critical reading procedure, and hence the translation of Nietzsche's "transvaluation of values" and anti-Darwinism into a program of "reading." In this regard, Gourmont's Natural Philosophy of Love, which Pound translated and to which he added a lengthy afterword, is most important and demands close attention as a kind of "theoretical" text. But, first, we might consider Gourmont's ambiguous role in Pound's efforts to "conquer America." As London Editor of The Little Review, Foreign Correspondent for Poetry, and Paris Correspondent for The Dial, especially from 1915-1921, Pound transported the ideas, and sometimes translated the works of Remy de Gourmont into American criticism. At the same time, he also practiced the journalistic ideal of allowing writers to "write frankly," which at least one American poet took to mean "Frenchly," and thus as a threat to American poetry. William Carlos Williams who felt besieged by Pound, Eliot, and Gourmont, offers this fantastic commentary on a "reading scene" involving Pound, "the best enemy of United States verse," and his two cohorts: Imagine an international congress of poets at Paris or Versailles, Remy de Gourmont (now dead) pre- siding, poets all speaking five languages fluently. Ezra stands up to represent U.S. verse and Gourmont sits down smiling. Ezra begins by reading "La Figlia che Piange." It would be a pretty pastime to gather into a mental basket the thoughts of the ten French- men present, their impression of the sort of United States that very fine flower was picked from.6 Here, in "The Prologue" to Kora in Hell, Gourmont appears crucial to Pound's adoption of Eliot's Europeanism. According to Williams, Gourmont's apparently traditional scholarship and his post-Symbolist verse threatened the American independence and, more seriously, the modernism of the two most influential American poets: "Eliot's more exquisite work is rehash, repetition in another way of Verlaine, Baude- laire, Maeterlinck-conscious or unconscious-just as there were Pound's early paraphrases from Yeats and his constant cribbings from Renaissance, Provence, and the Modern French: men content with the connotations of their masters" (Imag, p. 24; my italics). For Williams, the idea of offering as the representative "American" poem 407</page><page sequence="4">Eliot's mood piece with an archaic title was as prepostrous as it was Poundian. Williams fails to remark the differences between the two "Gourmonts" of his compatriots. Eliot and Pound both acknowledged the influence and critical acumen of the Frenchman. For example, in The Sacred Wood he is "the most perfect critic" for his Benda-like refusal to commit treason against the apolitical posture of critics and academics (excerpts of La Trahison des Clercs were serialized in The Criterion, 1923). For Pound, Gourmont was the champion of unpopular aesthetic and political causes, a virtual anthology of "Moeurs con- temporaines," more pedagogue that poet or critic.7 Moreover, because he was both "European" and "internationalist," Gourmont was master to Pound's changing interpretations of several traditions. Indeed, it was this flexibility in authorizing various positions that made Gourmont an especially useful and long-lived figure for Pound's metamorphic Kulchur. Thus, as fellow-worker, or as guiding spirit, in the Parisian "laboratory of ideas," Gourmont informed Pound's "modernism" as well as his antiquarianism-in ways Eliot disapproved and Williams did not (fore-)see.8 Pound's endorsement of Gourmont's (French) open-minded- ness and antinationalism appears in the text of "The Prologue," not only in Williams's dismissive fable, but also in the long quotation from Pound's letter about what it means to be a "REAL American." In this letter, of November 10, 1917, Pound cites Williams's own "foreignness," by way of affirming the inescapable yet salutary foreign influences on American verse: What the h--I do you a bloomin' foreigner know about the place. Your pere only penetrated the edge and you've never been west of Upper Darby, or the Maunchauck switchback. Would H. [Pound's original letter specifies "Harriet," as in Monroe] with the swirl of the prairie wind in her underwear, or the virile Sandburg recognize you, an effete easterner as a REAL American? INCONCEIVABLE!!! You thank your bloomin' gawd you've got enough Spanish blood to muddy up your mind, and prevent the current American ideation from going through it like a colander. (Imag, p. 11) Pound's definition of "REAL American" cuts both ways. On the one hand, he stresses the importance of rootedness, of being born in America and knowing its frontiers; on the other hand, he insists that American thought needs the infusion of Europe's more substantial tradition; even if this tradition is "muddy," it prevents the usual American habit of passively relaying popular ideas-the "colander" mode of ideation Williams escapes. Thus, if he does not go so far as 408</page><page sequence="5">to "dissociate" two notions of "American" or two ways of relating to "the foreign," Pound suggests that America is a place of transformation, where ideas drawn from Europe, perhaps more through a process of "condensation" or amalgamation than simple translation, become original and native-again. Even as he had claimed to advance beyond Whitman's influence, to escape his own American inheritance, he mixes his own poetic genealogy. For instance, in "What I Feel About Walt Whitman," a short essay published eight years before he corrected Williams on the point of American legitimacy, he confesses his ambivalence about his native poetry: Personally, I might like to conceal my relationship to my spiritual father and brag about my more congenial ancestry-Dante, Shakespeare, Theo- critus, Villon, but the descent is a bit difficult to establish. And to be frank, Whitman is to my father- land (Patriam quam odi et amo for no uncertain reasons) what Dante is to Italy. (SP, p. 145; my italics) Thus, Pound outlines a reading program which virtually promises to reinscribe Whitman in Dante. He argues that American writers should (re-)turn to Europe in order to go beyond it, though they will never escape being American. And while it is perhaps going too far to say that his "frank" feelings about Whitman owe anything to Gourmont, Le Latine mystique, which finds Symbolism in Provengal texts, in the same sense that he proposes uncovering Whitman in Dante, was one of his first European "textbooks," providing him "new" ideas and also an example of how to assimilate "foreign" and "ancient" texts-how, that is, "to make it new." In this vein, in part of the letter to Williams which does not ap- pear in "The Prologue," he recommends: "Your sap is interrupted. Try De Gourmont's 'Epilogues' ('95-'98). And don't expect the world to re- volve around Rutherford" (LE, p. 123). The part of the letter Williams does quote includes a long passage from Gourmont's Epilogues, introduced by Pound's brief (self-)reflection on an American writing he defines as self-consciously appropriating a textual tradition: "Let me engage in the American habit of quotation." And here I quote Williams's quotation at some length because it indicates the "cos- mopolitanism" prerequisite to Pound's own reading procedure: Si le cosmopolitisme litt6raire gagnait encore et qu'il r6ussit &amp; 6teindre ce que les diff6rences de race ont allum6 de haine de sang parmi les hommes, j'y verrais un gain pour la civilisation et pour I'humanit6 tout entiere. . . . [Pound's ellipsis] L'amour excessif et exclusif d'une patrie a pour immediat corollaire I'horreur des patries 6trang6res. 409</page><page sequence="6">Cette folie gagne certaine 16tt6rateurs et le mime professeur, en sortant d'expliquer le Cid ou Don Juan, redige de gracieuses injures contre Ibsen et I'influence, h6las, trop illusoire, de son oeuvre, pourtant toute de lumiere et de beaut6. (Imag, p. 12; my italics) This passage quoted by Pound, and thus reinscribed by Williams, is part of Gourmont's argument that the raison d'etre of literary cosmopolitanism is the abolition of differences that lead to racial, or "blood" hatred, and thus to war and the simultaneous erection of the more fluxional stylistic, generic, gender, and cultural "differences" that generate Art. From Gourmont Pound borrowed stylistic and cultural "differences" for a poetic and critical cosmo- politanism-which is, after all, a gathering and not a synthesis. Gourmont suggested the terms of Pound's reformations of the American literati and curricula: that explicating, or advocating, the "great works" of "other" traditions should not involve the dismissal of one's own modernism; and conversely, that one's "Modernism" and "Americanism" need not demand the rejection of the European tradition. In this way, "Pound's Gourmont" argues equally against Eliot's continental nostalgia and Williams's nativist iconoclasm, upholding the ideals of heterogeneity and "reading" against both writers. Gourmont raised the question of national characters with regard to the pedagogic role of journalists, and in a way that Pound imitated. In an essay about Herbert Spencer, whom he claims was better understood by the French than the English, Gourmont explains the goal of writing "frankly," which is to say Frenchly, in the way Pound opposed the term to Williams's usage. Gourmont's "national- ism" involves a certain self-effacing irony when he opposes the French habit of playing with ideas to the English (and American?) habit of banishing them: C'est au journaliste A faire son education intellectuelle. En France, le journaliste n'y manque pas. Soyons juste: pour un grand 6crivain qu'il meconnait ou qu'il bafoue, il en c6l/bre dix avec abondance et avec entousiasme. Si le journal anglais est une 6cole d'ignorance, le journal francais est une 6cole de badauderie.9 To be "just," as Gourmont says, the same charges of uninformed enthusiasm could be brought against Pound, because he seems everywhere to prefer "gists and piths" to careful analyses. And more than once, he praises Gourmont for keeping ideas at a distance, 410</page><page sequence="7">for playing the part of a bricoleur, if not a badaudier ("star-gazer," idler), that is, a sort of "jack-of-all-trades," one who collects fragments, rather than advances logical arguments, and thus tests ideas in that peculiar "French laboratory."'0 The scientific or philosophical potential of Pound's "reading"-his reading-translation-metaphor-come into play, when, in a note, he finds the crux of Gourmont's "thought," at once critical and organic, exemplified in one of the fragments of "Dust for Sparrows": " 'Every thought is a stem, potentially a flower and fruit; some suggest, question the unknown, interview truth; some affirm' [All this little series of paragraphs should be taken in relation to Gourmont's essay on style. E.P.]" (my italics)." In like fashion, Pound treats the whole of Gourmont's fugitive works as a compendium of poetic yet scientific notions which can be used to "interview truth," to question scientific-and poetic- method. This is to say, despite the philosophically suspect procedure of drawing metaphors, or even metaphors of metaphors, from fragments, Pound recognizes the critical thrust of Gourmont's "sensuous wisdom," his "heterogeneous works." Therefore, several years before undertaking to translate Natural Philosophy, Pound ascribes a unity or authorial "self" to the Frenchman's contradictory mixture of feeling and thought, poetry and science: He recognizes the right of individuals to feel differently. Confucian, Epicurean, a considerer and entertainer of ideas, this sensuous wisdom is almost the one ubiquitous element, the "self" which keeps his superficially heterogeneous work vaguely "uni- fied." The study of emotion does not follow a set chronological arc: it extends from Physique de I'Amour to Le Latin Mystique; from the condensation of Fabre's knowledge of insects to "Amas ut facias pulchram" in the Sequaire of Goddeschalk (Le Latine Mystique).'2 (LE, pp. 340-41) Here Pound suggests the wider methodological implications of Gourmont's procedure: the re-vitalization of abstract by poetic language. In addition, then, to using Gourmont's works and position-which is to say, both his "views" and his "function" as storehouse ("Way-station"?) of European ideas-against the national and generic definitions imposed upon literature, he adopts Gourmont's (Nietzschean) project of reversing the entropy of Western philosophy-that is, the exhaustion of its creativity and its rejection of linguistic tropes.'3 If Pound adopts the very tropes by which Gourmont hoped to "turn" scientific and philosophical thought back toward poetry's original (figurative) "force," this too is in keeping with the Frenchman's style-and with what Derrida has described as the 411</page><page sequence="8">inevitability of treating metaphor more metaphorico. Thus, in a passage which draws upon what Pound took to be the central notion of Natural Philosophy, "spermatic thought," he at once dismisses philosophical and psycho-analytical ("German") thought and yet finds system (even an "aesthetics") in Gourmont's treatment of insect sexuality: From the studies of insects to Christine evoked from the thoughts of Diomede, sex is not a monstrosity or an exclusively German study .... Sex, in so far as it is not a purely physiological reproductive mechanism, lies in the domain of aesthetics, the junction of tactile and magnetic senses. (LE, p. 341) II In passing on the The Natural Philosophy of Love, we might note that both the notions of "sensuous wisdom" and the endeavor to make philosophy sensuous-or, more appropriately, sensual-brings Pound, by way of Gourmont, into relation with Nietzsche, that German "philosopher" who asked: "What is truth? Inertia? That hypothesis which gives contentment, smallest expenditure of physical force, etc."14 Is it possible that, despite a certain French indirection, the American poet came to approximate the rigorous critical program of "transvaluation of values"? His translation of Physique de I'amour brought Pound as close to Nietzsche as any work he undertook.15 I will argue that by adopting "Gourmont's Nietzsche," he does indeed become affiliated with the rhetorical critique of philosophical and scientific "values." The Natural Philosophy of Love does not, of course, present "pure" Nietzsche. Instead, Nietzsche and Herbert Spencer, Gourmont's ideal "readers" of philosophy and science, respectively, preside over the Frenchman's critique of the moral and methodological prejudices of German philosophy and English naturalism. In a sort of reductio ad absurdum of taxonomical rigor, Gourmont classifies and details the sexual excesses of insects, in order to expose the moralistic anthropomorphism that finds religious and social conventions in the animal world, and thus distorts "scientific" investigation. At the same time, he questions the mutual exclusivity of the poetic and scientific discourses, noting that both rely on the same rhetorical figures and strategies-usually the uninterrogated "metaphors," as he terms them, of "God," "Country," "Family," and the like. Further, whether or not Pound recognized the Nietzschean character of his own "literary" application of Gourmont's "science textbook," his "Translator's Postscript" addresses fundamental issues of both literary and scientific method, ending in a "transvaluation" of the "traditional wisdom" about modern readers and writers and (the) tradition. In this way, 412</page><page sequence="9">Gourmont-like Fenollosa, Frobenius, and Agassiz-involves Pound in the scientific revolution effected by Darwin and analyzed-or, better, "opened to interpretation"-by Nietzsche. In a lengthy obituary, "La Mort de Nietzsche," Gourmont com- ments directly, if moralistically, on the French reception of Nietzsche. He complains that while philosophers (the French Academy) readily accepted Nietzsche as "the great poet," they ignored his role as "creator of values" ("professeurs de philosophie... acceptant I'ecrivain, proclaimant le grand po6te, ils d6daigent le cr6ateur de valeurs").'6 For his part, Gourmont praises, but refuses to separate, both the aesthetic and critical aspects of Nietzsche's text, claiming that, out of entirely new and personal ideas ("des idees personnells et toutes neuves"), he created a procedure for interrogating all "Idea." Thus, Gourmont was, in 1900, already an almost deconstructive reader of a particular Nietzsche. In the "Why I am so Clever" section of Ecce Homo, Nietzsche shifts the "burden of interpretation," as it were, to artists, thereby exchanging the creative for the critical discourse-or, more exactly, disturbing the easy distinction between the two. And, by the time Gourmont wrote Le Livre des masques (1896), a series of critical bio- graphies of the Symbolists, Nietzsche had also authorized what would become the cult of the individual and the artist: "The capital crime for a writer is conformism, imitativeness, submission to rules and teachings. The work of the writer must be not only the reflection, but the enlarged reflection of his personality" (CW, p. 181). This naive, revolutionary stance-really a caricature of Nietzsche-gains interest because Gourmont uses it in his own battle against systematic philosophy: when, for example, he attacks Kant, his most frequent target, for rejecting artistic and "scientific" freedom and choosing instead "to throw himself to the aid of a shipwrecked morality" (CW, p. 181). This complaint against Kant's moral and religious conformism is thematized in The Natural Philosophy of Love. Nietzsche also stressed the essential "foreignness" (the oxymoron is appropriate) of art and artists, strategically opposing Wagner's-and his own-"Parisian" sensibility to "German virtues": "I am so alien in my instinct to everything German.... the first contact with Wagner was also the first deep breath of my life .... I revered him as a foreign land, as an antithesis, and as incarnate protest against 'German virtues' " (EH, p. 247). Here Nietzsche does not simply replace one nationalism with another, but makes such definitions absurd by ironizing the role of "the enemy" of the German state, France. But, if his artist-decadent has a home, it is Paris, which as Pound said in his own argument against (American) provincialism, is "the capital of Europe." Nietzsche attributes to "Parisian seriousness" the very sort of psychological subtlety, the dramatic and ironic skill he demanded of his "new philosopher": As an artist one has no home in Europe, except Paris: the delicatesse in all five artistic senses.... the 413</page><page sequence="10">fingers for nuances, the psychological morbidity are found only in Paris. Nowhere else does one have this passion in questions of form, this seriousness in mise en scone-which is Parisian seriousness par excellence. (EH, p. 248) Here one can detect the symptoms of Gourmont's use of Nietzsche, from whom he claimed to have learned the skill of examin- ing the "forms" or Categories, even the connotations of the individual words of philosophical argument. Moreover, Nietzsche featured pro- minently, if sometimes anonymously, in his dramatizations (mise en scene) of his methodological battles against academic science, philosophy, and the other entrenched systems. It is, then, in his idiosyncratic, and not entirely "French," readings of Nietzsche as the rhetorician who embarrassed metaphysics that Gourmont approaches the rigor of the Nietzschean critique. In a remarkable passage which presages the "New [French] Nietzsche," Gourmont credits "the creator of values" with teaching philosophers how to "deconstruct" metaphysics. While we cannot here explore Gourmont's place in (the margins of) the Nietzsche- Heidegger-Derrida critical enterprise, it is noteworthy that he not only deploys deconstructive strategies (irony, "poetic" or figurative language, the enigmatic notions or "undecidables" that upset discur- sive norms), but also uses the figure of "the house of philosophy" de- stroyed through the critique of its grounding concepts in order to characterize Nietzsche's reading. In this way, he "reads," as it were, before the letter, Heidegger's nostalgic (even "onto-theo-logic") metaphor of "Building Dwelling Thinking," the "poeticizing" (re-)construction of authentic thinking that survives the death of metaphysics."7 Whether or not Heidegger can be implicated here, Gourmont, who adopted the pose of destroyer of metaphysics, champion of poetic against abstract language, had as his adversaries those "eternal"-canonical?-philosophers ("les philosophes, les eternals professeurs") who failed to recognize Nietzsche's overthrow of metaphysics: Je crois qu'il y a un grand changement. Nous avons appris par Nietzsche a d6construire les anciennes m6taphysiques 6difi6es sur la base de I'abstraction. Chacune des antiques pierres d'angle, les voila poussiere, et toute la maison s'est 6croul6e. Qu'est- ce que le libert? Un mot. Alors, plus de morale, sinon esth6tique ou sociale.18 (my italics) This "deconstructive" (or to abuse translation, de-construing) Nietzsche is instrumental in Gourmont's critique of the moral pre- judices of modern science, and we will encounter him again, in the text of The Natural Philosophy of Love. It is, however, in an essay about Herbert Spencer, whom 414</page><page sequence="11">Gourmont took to be a subtle rhetorician and, not without con- tradiction, the founder of at least one system, that he explains the ideals and procedures of the deconstruction of scientific method. Perhaps not accidentally, the "house of philosophy," as opposed to museums-of science, industry, and the fine arts-also figures in his tribute. Therefore, we can best approach "Gourmont's Nietzsche" by way of a detour through Spencer's fanciful "Synthetic Philosophy" and his "sociology." According to Gourmont, Spencer's principle qualifications were those of journalist, free-lance "expert," and unemployed engineer; indeed, had he been in Paris, he might have been an "intel- lectual," a vocation still unknown in England and America. In other words, he did not "master" one discourse; rather, he challenged the assumptions and mutual exclusivity of several. Though Gourmont's notion of him as a critic of science is idealized, Spencer's search for method would seem to parallel the efforts of Gourmont and Pound on behalf of science and poetry-of a "science of poetry." Spencer's project of charting human accomplishments rested on one principle, evolution, and assumed the perfectability and the ultimate "integration" of (Western) civilization into a "great society" -one which was to resemble that of his idealized Victorian England. Yet, at the same time, he focused on heterogeneous details and un- accountable artistic and scientific inventions; that is, on the "dif- ferential" character of compound evolution. He thus disturbed the Darwinian model only to raise procedural or methodological problems and leave them unresolved. Gourmont notes his inconsistencies, suggesting that, however chimerical, these stimulate thought and derive from Spencer's wish to prevent evolution from devolving into fairytale: L'idee d'6volution n'est pas une chimere, quand on la congoit purement m6canique, c'est-&amp;-dire quand on se garde de lui donner les buts moraux on bienfaisants. Spencer n'eut pas cette prudence. II crut que I'6volution evoluait vers le bien, vers le bonheur: et revoila les contes A endormir les petits enfants.19 Gourmont's disdain for the "watering [or wearing] down" of science can be linked to the nineteenth-century anxiety that human creativity-indeed, the whole physical universe-was becoming entropic. The struggle of Art against convention, science, and "the mechanical," a theme shared by Nietzsche, Spencer, Gourmont, and Pound, was one way of reversing this process-if not of escaping the laws of thermodynamics. In Gourmont's case, the desire to at once glorify science and philosophy and save them from themselves issues in parodies of, even animal fables about, the great scientists and rationalists (his/Pound's term "ignorantist" denotes the rationalist or idealist tenet that experience will not yield knowledge or "idea"). For example, in The Natural Philosophy of Love, Kant not only rides a 415</page><page sequence="12">child's "hobby-horse" or trained pony, he is one: Kant's ignorantism is the masterpiece of these [philosophical] training exercises, where starting from the categoric stable the learned quadruped necessarily thither returns, having jumped through all the proper disks of scholastic reasoning. Observers of animal habits fall regularly into the pre- judice of attributing to beasts directive principles which only a long philosophic education and es- pecially Christianity have rammed into restive human docility. (NPL, p. 87) This whimsical account of philosophical misprision is also a warning against the loss of creativity and the creative impulse which war against docility-against system and systematized humanism. Spencer became Gourmont's hero, his champion against Kant, Darwin, and the bourgeoisie, by virtue of a certain "anarchical" genius (the same sort of knack for collecting unaccountable data that Pound attributed to the Frenchman). For example, while acknowledging that Spencer's "critical sense" (sens critique) was mediocre (plus mediocres), Gourmont adds: "Mais son intelligence etait vaste. C'etait un immense palais sans art et sans goOt ou il entassait les faits dans les armoires; de temps en temps, il en dressait I'inventaire. C'est de qu'il appelait faire la synthese des connaissances humaines.'"20 Thus, Spencer's "thought," if not his "Synthetic Philosophy," is a great baroque palace-or, better, that favorite nineteenth-century space, a "baroque gallery" or "artist's studio" in which were displayed representative works of any number of arts and epochs: say, a reproduction of a Michelangelo statue here, a bust of Caesar there, a Valasquez over there, a large closet-or armoir-with every manner of "scientific" or surgical implement over in the corner. Note that Spencer's "palace" lacks art and taste; his "armoires" contain an inventory of heterogeneous facts capable of many different arrangements and interpretations. Therein lies his utility for Gourmont, who always had an eye out for the odd fact, the pretentious citation. Of this anarchy of detail Gourmont fashioned his own rhetorical strategy of "dissociating" layers of interpretation and questioning whatever ideas remained. For Pound, Gourmont's own writings were storehouses or palaces of ideas, though he never questioned his hero's "critical sense," either in matters of selection or method. Curiously, the figure of the palace/museum features in Pound's own aesthetic even as a "rhetorical strategy." For example, The Tempio, Malatesta's palace- temple-collection, housed what Pound claimed were the finest remains of pagan along with some of the most interesting curios of Christian art. Moreover, Pound's favorite condottieri brought together the best artists of several media and styles to erect his monument and create the treasures it housed. A passage from "Canto IX" can be taken as a figure for Pound's own efforts to gather the salvageable 416</page><page sequence="13">fragments of civilization into his epic and his reading text. The Tempio, which has been thought as tasteless as Hearst's San Simeon, is part of his argument for a cultural synthesis: [Malatesta] " 'built a temple so full of pagan works'/i.e. Sigismundo/and in a style 'Past ruin'd Latium'/The filigree hiding the gothic/with a touch of rhetoric in the whole" ("Canto IX": p. 41; my italics). One does not know which sense of "rhetoric" Pound had in mind. Surely, "filigree hiding the gothic," which is to say, filigree upon filigree, suggests the sort of "ornamental metaphor" Pound everywhere rejects. However, since The Tempio recurs in his readings of Papal corruption and the Church's destruction of Classical beauty by a misplaced orthodoxy, Malatesta's masterpiece is also an "interpretive metaphor." Hence this monstrous creation, "both apex and in verbal sense a monu- mental failure" (GK, p. 159), becomes, like "Gourmont's Spencer," a tool against aesthetic and other orthodoxies, as well as a figure for Pound's own heterogeneous text. Gourmont is explicit about Spencer's role in reversing the es- sentializing tendencies of modern science and philosophy. He is a sort of antidote (preservatif) against both evil or unpropitious thoughts (mauvais pensees) and rationalism (rationalisme)-a "new mode of sanity" which arose when Gourmont tested for "poisons" in the "laboratory of ideas"? By his account, the English naturalist was part of a (counter-)tradition of experimental scientists unspoiled by System and its prejudices: Spencer etait naturiste, comme Bacon, et comme lui, collectionneur. Oubliez le catalogue et regardez dans les vitrines: c'est un beau musee."'21 While Gourmont might seem to legitimize Spencer by equating him with Bacon, the titular father of "the scientific method," he stresses those qualities anathema to method; his "Bacon" thereby disturbs science at its (non-)origin, by an invention and inventiveness as radical as what Thomas Kuhn has termed the "change of paradigm."'22 Gourmont again accomplishes this reading by using the figure of the collection, this time a museum full of exhibit cases that should be consulted instead of an exhibit catalogue, itself a questionable scientific text. There is never the suggestion of abandoning text for direct treatment of data, nor is there a book involved-rather a "collection," simply another genre of catalogue. Thus, Spencer provides neither system nor unmediated ex- perience, but an aleatory collection of museum pieces.23 One does not know whether Pound had this passage in mind when he uses the figure of the museum to characterize his own reading program. And, surely, a chain of texts comprised of temples, museums, and the "thought(s)" of intellectuals cannot be (mis-)taken as a "source" or "influence." Nevertheless, in "How to Read," he says: I have been accused of wishing to provide a "portable substitute for the British Museum," which I would do, like a shot, were it possible. It isn't. .. . It struck me that the best history of painting in London was the National Gallery, and that the best history of 417</page><page sequence="14">literature, more particularly of poetry would be a twelve volume anthology with each poem chosen... because it contained an invention. (LE, pp. 16-17) In another context, Pound associates Gourmont's name with this "British Museum project," when, in response to Sarah Perkins Cope, an undergraduate who wrote for a "reading list," he says: "My generation needed Remy de Gourmont. Yeats used to say I was trying to supply a portable substitute for the British Museum!!!" (LE, p. 257). Critics have read such comments about museums and antho- logies as programmatic statements of Pound's theory of "direct presentation" or reference to the "text itself." This is grossly to under- estimate Pound's understanding of the politics of museums and of publishing, and to disregard his careful attention to processes of selection and arrangement. Take, for example, his hope of replacing Palgrave's Golden Treasury with the ABC of Reading's "Exhibits"-the section title alludes both to laboratory and museum exhibits. This does not illustrate his belief in, say, the power of "poetry itself" to civilize, but it proves his awareness of the rhetorical, pedagogic, and political force of collections. Similarly, The Tempio "reads" the Vatican or the Louvre, which, on the basis of Pound's commentary, are shown to have as many strata, as much rhetoric, as The Tempio. The various temples, museums, and textual palimpsests scattered throughout the texts of Spencer, Gourmont, and Pound expose the "rhetoric" of museums and System. Not only do museums rely on complex interpretations of "aesthetic value" and appropri- ateness, they are erected as monuments to a particular ("idea" of) civilization or government, that is, to what Pound came to call, borrow- ing from Frobenius, "Paideuma," a word that derives not only from the Greek notion of paideia (culture) but from paidia (play, poetic language), two senses of a common etymological line which Plato had separated out, in order to save the first from the dangerous rhetoric of the second. In other words, they represent not only the art of the past but also the self-reflections of their present donors, fund- raisers, and the viewers of Art. They are, then, at least doubly rhetorical (or "rhetorical" in de Man's two senses, "figures of cognition" and "lies"): they are synecdoches of Art and "misrepre- sentations" of the powers who erected them. If he would not have approved of the terms of current rhetorical and ideological criticism, Pound was well aware of the stakes of such argument, and his own rhetorical figures affiliate him with Gourmont's more thorough adoption of Spencer's "method," decidedly not with the nostalgic or reactionary humanism he has always been affiliated with. Pound's ease of movement among discourses and genres characterizes his text from the start and becomes increasingly iden- tified with his search for a unifying principle-or method-which might account for the inherently disseminative force of poetry. The various temples and museums that dot his text also suggest the way in which he allowed metaphor to play upon his reading "method." 418</page><page sequence="15">Finally, The Natural Philosophy of Love offers what Pound claimed as not only a master principle which could unite all science and poetry but also (a figure for) "the very fluid of life itself." Thus, out of Gourmont's equation of seminal and cerebral fluids, intellection and instinct, he fashioned an account of the poetic medium and textual transmission. Ironically, he offers as the unifying principle underlying all the privileged details and individual geniuses of literature, a biological metaphor which stresses the dissemination of "images," not the orderly progress or evolution of "tradition"-the pun on semen and seme, pointed out by a recent critic, is appropriate to Pound's notion of a "spermatic economy," which might be said to be in a state of "run away inflation.'"24 In other words, Pound again offers disruption and excess by way of system: poetic figures as definitions of poetry, a notion of metaphor which, as we shall see, works more metaphorico. Moreover, he claims that his borrowed "hypothesis" ("i// y aurait peut-etre une certain correlation entre la copulation complete et profonde et le development cerebral") is more comprehensive and more "scientific"-in his peculiar sense of a science, which is, like "the ideogrammic method," grounded in "natural metaphor"-than the reigning physiology, psychology, and epistemology: "This hypothesis would explain a certain number of as yet uncorrelated phenomena both psychological and physiological. It would explain the enormous content of the brain as a maker and presenter of images" (NPL, p. 206). Thus, in a sort of circular evolution ("re- volution" or troping) which escapes both entropy and mono-linear progress, Pound's method departs from and returns to poetry, and particularly to erotic lyrics, and "poetic metaphysics," both of which he associated with Gourmont's reading program: Perhaps the clue is in Propertius after all: Igenium nobis ipsa puella fecit. There is a whole of the Xllth century love cult, and Dante's metaphysics a little to one side, and Gourmont's Latin Mystique; and for image making both Fenollosa on "The Chinese Written Character," and the paragraphs in "Le Probleme du Style." At any rate the quarrel between cerebralist and viveur and ignorantist ends, if the brain is thus conceived not as a separate and desiccated organ, but as the very fluid of life itself. (NPL, p. 219; my italics) Pound sought a brand of "Synthetic Philosophy," yet one more consistently opposed to philosophical system than Spencer's. This de(con)structive war of literature against philosophy-even of Nietzsche against Darwinism-is, as Pound suggests, indebted to Gourmont, on at least three scores: Le Latin mystique, "Le Probleme du style," and, most importantly, The Natural Philosophy of Love. In the course of his "Translator's Postscript," he silently adopts Gourmont's "transvaluations" of several key terms in order to 419</page><page sequence="16">reassess the values of "instinct," "sexuality," "nature," and "creativity." These revisions underwrite Pound's notion (the very antithesis of Eliot's idea of tradition) of the revolutionary and utilitarian aspects of poetic "image-making," which is but one manifestation of the prodigious thought of the "seminal brain": Creative thought has manifested itself in images, in music, which is to sound what the concrete image is to sight. And the thought of genius, even of the mathematical genius, the mathematical prodigy, is really the same sort of thing, it is a sudden out-spurt of mind which takes the form demanded by the problem; which creates the answer, and baffles the man counting on the abacus. (NPL, p. 212) Like Gourmont, Pound is "all over the shop" or the museum or the university curriculum. His critiques of the transmission of texts and tradition by means of the "ejaculation" of thought, his "overcoming," as it were, of the moral and genealogical prejudices of literary history must be understood in the context of Gourmont's adoption of Nietzsche's transvaluation. This conjunction of Nietzscheanism and (anti-)Darwinism has been noted by Gourmont's editors and critics. Burton Roscoe, for example, suggests a link between transvaluation and Gourmont's reversal of the Darwinian teleology, which places the Victorian Christian at the summit of evolution.25 Richard Aldington noted Gourmont's esteem for Spencer's scientism and his attraction to the flexibility of transvaluation. Yet such "associations" remain to be explored with regard to Pound's "reading" and Nietzsche's "transvaluation," especially because the latter term is too readily accepted as commonplace and stable-that is, as a philosophical concept, rather than a rhetorical strategy. Therefore, we should now pick up the thread of transvaluation as it runs through Nietzsche's text and, however unaccountably, through Gourmont's to Pound's.26 III "Transvaluation of all values" is no simple formula; indeed, it names Nietzsche's whole interrogation of the grounding concepts of science and metaphysics. Like "Will to Power," which can be thought of as a particularly militant phase of Nietzsche's deconstructive reading, it strategically disturbs established beliefs and Truth. It is not, however, nihilistic; rather, it affirms interpretation by abolishing-but not simply reversing-the "mastery" of philo- sophical or religious over aesthetic and sensuous "values." It would seem that Gourmont knew this sense of the term, but, perhaps, did not apply it with the full rigor of more recent French Nietzscheans. Maurice Blanchot, for example, makes a useful distinction between transvaluation and the nihilism (or even "modernism") which would 420</page><page sequence="17">simply replace old with new values: "Transvaluation does not give us a new scale of values on the basis of negating every absolute value; it makes us attain an order from which the notion of value ceases to apply."27 Transvaluation equates "natural" and "cultural" phenomena, in order to show that all of these "things" are interpre- tations: "There are no moral phenomena, there is only a moral inter- pretation of these phenomena" (WP, p. 149). This is to say that scientists, philosophers, and artists are engaged in maintaining a nearly invisible system of moral values dictated by religion, human- ism, and the reigning behavioral norms: "Fundamental insight: Kant as well as Hegel and Schopenhauer-the skeptical-epochistic atti- tude-as well as the pessimistic-have a moral origin" (WP, p. 221). It is Nietzsche's-"the new philosopher's"-special mission to analyze or anatomize the metaphysical assumptions which enforce Truth. The best definition of "transvaluation" appears in that crucial section of Ecce Homo, "Why I am so Clever," in a passage especially difficult for English translators. In fact, Walter Kaufmann has rendered the key term, Umvertung der Werte, "revaluation of all values," suggesting negation or simple reversal. Yet it should be kept in mind that um, the preposition meaning "about," "round," and "round about," has the sense of movement or troping (as in Umwandlung, or transformation). Nietzsche's definition, which exemplifies the working-the "praxis," not the "theory"-of trans- valuation, is not a re-valuation of the philosopher's task, but a rhetorical analysis of "philosophical disinterestedness," which has always been opposed to such things as (animal) instinct and the falsi- fication of Art: For the task of a revaluation of all values more capacities may have been needed than ever dwelt together in a single individual-above all, even contrary capacities that had to be kept from disturb- ing, destroying one another. An order of rank among these capacities; distance; the art of separating without setting against one another; to mix nothing to "reconcile" nothing; a tremendous variety that is nevertheless the opposite of chaos-this was the precondition, the long secret work and artistry of my instinct. (EH, p. 254; my italics) As befits a work entitled Ecce Homo, Nietzsche here begins autobiographically, but his nearly biological ("capacities," "instincts") analysis undoes the notion of a unified "subject," let alone an authorial self. For Nietzsche, the philosopher is the highest man, not because of his proximity to truth or his resolution of all con- flicting interpretations, but because he accepts and lives as many contradictions as possible. Just so, this very definition also addresses the "new science" which opposes intellection to instinct, and banishes Art from philosophy and science. This is to say that 421</page><page sequence="18">Nietzsche's oxymoron "artistry of my instinct" (Kunsterschaft meines Instinckts) "transvalues" the Darwinian notion of evolution away from "the tyranny of instinct" toward intellection and "culture." While Gourmont cites neither Ecce Homo nor the Will to Power's even more explicit anti-Darwinism, The Natural Philosophy of Love adopts a similar transvaluative strategy in order to make the point about Darwin's too great love of System: "Darwin arrived, inaugurated a useful system, but his views were too systematized, his aim too explanatory and his scale of creature with man at the summit, as the culmination of universal effort is of too theologic simplicity" (NPL, p. 12). Like Nietzsche, Gourmont wants to introduce contra- diction into system, poetry into philosophy, in order to reverse the essentializing, and anti-sensual, tendencies of modern science. To this end, he protests the privilege afforded the intellect at the expense of instinct, in a passage that might be thought to echo Nietzsche's assaults on the false philosophers who, repressing their own desires, "master" the creative force of Art: "Every organized animal has a master; its nervous system .. . As soon as this new master appears in the world it reigns despotically.. . and lifting itself into the royal role" (NPL, p. 204).28 This "centralized power," as it were, is redistributed in Pound's notion of an anarchical (or at least dispersed and multi-centered) spermatic nervous system: "The brain itself, is, in origin and develop- ment, only a sort of great clot of genital fluid held in suspense and in other species, held in several clots over the scattered chief nerve centres" (NPL, p. 206). Such a multiplication of centers-ana- logously, of literary sources, methods, and interpretations-reflects Pound's desire to supplement or re-invent tradition, not to abolish it. At several points in his two hundred pages of nearly porno- graphic descriptions of insect copulation, Gourmont makes program- matic statements-or, better, statements critical of scientific "program"-which Pound borrows for his own long-evolving (de-)definition of culture. While Pound does not cite a specific passage in this regard, one might suppose that, as he pondered Gourmont's every word for its translation into American, he might have paused over this passage, which accuses science and "common sense" of the sort of rhetorical obfuscation he everywhere descries: The question of instinct is perhaps the most nerve- racking there is.... In the vulgar contrast only over- hears the considerable naivete that animals have instinct and man intelligence. This error, pure rhetoric, has prevented, not only the answer to the question which still seems a long way off, but the scientific exposure of the question itself. It includes but two formulae: Either instinct is a fructification of intelligence; or intelligence is an augmentation of intellect. (NPL, p. 185; my italics) As we have seen, Pound poses the question of renewing artistic 422</page><page sequence="19">creativity, and resolves the conflicts of instinct and intelligence, in terms of a "fructifying intelligence," specifically in the metaphor of a "spermatazoic brain." In this way, he engages Gourmont's Nietzschean critique of scientific method in the most profound way; that is, indirectly, metaphorically, even accidentally. In order to grasp the methodological implications of such a reading, for which Pound provides no commentary, we again have recourse to Nietzsche. Nietzsche proposes analyzing obfuscating moral "concepts" by attending to life's small things-to kleines Dinge, not Ding-an-sich. Gourmont might be thought to take Nietzsche a bit too literally when he focuses on minutiae of insect copulation to expose the prejudices of science, but his analysis uses these strategies: Small things-nutrition, place, climate, recreation, the whole causistry of selfishness-are in- conceivably more important than everything one has taken to be important so far. Precisely here one must begin to relearn. What mankind has so far con- sidered seriously have not been realities but mere imaginings .... "God," "soul," "virtue," "sin," "beyond," "Truth," "eternal life"-But the greatness of human nature its divinity was sought in them-all the problems of politics, of social organization, and of education have been falsified through and through because one mistook the most harmful men for the great men-because one learned to despise "little" things, which means the basic concerns of life itself. (EH, p. 256) While Nietzsche takes aim at far-reaching political, social, and pedagogic issues, Gourmont ostensibly limits his analysis to the insect world. Nevertheless, by reading anthropomorphized natural specimens alongside the text of nineteenth-century "natural philoso- phy," he extends Nietzsche's critique of philosophy's moral falsifications to discourses as varied as literature and entomology. Like Nietzsche, Gourmont undertakes a careful rhetorical (tropic) analysis of the names science bestows on natural phenomena; that is, he exposes science's "facts" as complex inter- pretations-if not simple "fictions." Rather than rejecting science, he causes poetry and rhetoric to intervene in "scientific method." Nietzsche says, "it is not the victory of science that distinguishes our nineteenth century, but the victory of scientific method over science" (WP, p. 261). Though less rigorously than his precursor, who had re- fused to make "poetry" and "science" simple binary opposites, Gourmont enters this staged battle on the side of poetry. His undoing of English naturalism by reference to "French thought" is a case in point-and, in passing, one might note that Pound not only praises this French habit of mind, he similarly finds in literature a scientific precision absent from science itself: 423</page><page sequence="20">M de Sade like to imagine rutting where blood and sperm flowed simultaneously; mere kindergarten manual (Berquinade) if one contemplates, not with- out bewilderment the ingenious orthopter, the praying mantis, the insect which prays to God, la prego-Dion as the Provengals call her, the prophet- ess as the Greek said! Baudelaire's verses ridiculing those who wish to "aux choses de I'amour meler I'honnetete" Mix seemliness into affairs of Love have a value not only moral but scientific. (NPL, p. 77; my italics) By thus invoking the "unnatural" or pan-natural philosophy of Sade and the decadent poetry of Baudelaire, he mocks the Darwinian attribution of piety to the "praying mantis," a modern personification that is only the latest instance in a whole etymology of sentimental names which fictionalize insect onanism, sodomy, cannibalism, and the other "natural aberrations," if you will, that outstrip Sade's fantasies. It would seem that Gourmont also works a subtle parody of that favorite trope of philologists, which is turning names into Truth by showing the centrality and antiquity of a particular usage. Etymology and entomology both undergo rhetorical analysis, as Gourmont transvalues their shared onto-theo-logical assumptions. Gourmont deploys various rhetorical strategies against the most privileged (value) judgments of science and theology, the "natural" and "normal." Arguing that libertinism is a symptom of higher intelligence, that promiscuity raises man beyond the mechanical demands of reproduction (both sexual and technological), he shows that morality, an arbitrary and repressive system of signs, has no foundation, and language itself no origin, in (the things of) nature. "It is difficult, especially when dealing with man, to dis- tinguish between normal and abnormal; what is the normal; what the natural? Nature ignores this adjective" (NPL, p. 79). This passage summarizes Gourmont's analysis of human instinct and intellect, which he sees converging in the imaginative artistry of ("unnatural") human sexual practices: "One must not be gulled by the scholastic distinction between the instinct and intelligence; man is as full of instincts as the insect most visibly instinctive; he obeys them by methods more diverse" (NPL, p. 15). Pound translates the notion of creative sexuality into the aesthetic realm when, for example, he suggests that all the instincts, capacities, even the aberrations of the animal kingdom are available to man-specifically "the poet," who most readily creates "forms" and images: Man is the sum of the animals, the sum of their instincts.... Given, first a few, then as we get to our own condition, a mass of these spermatozoic parti- 424</page><page sequence="21">cles withheld.... Each of these particles is, we need not say conscious of form, but has by all counts a capacity for formal expression: is not thought pre- cisely a form comparing and form combining? (NPL, p. 211) Thus, both Gourmont and Pound would seem to argue that Darwin and the humanists correctly place man at the end of the evolu- tionary process, but for all the wrong reasons. Man-and especially the Artist-should hold a position of preeminence by virtue of trans- valuing and therefore reintroducing sexual force and other "instincts," not by evolving beyond them. According to such a revision, Man is a compendium of desires and nearly infinite ways of satisfying them: "Man is the sum of the animals, the sum of their instincts" (NPL, p. 211), and even an excess of any sum. Art, the agent of change and progress, unsettles bourgeois society and morality; thus Gourmont's biological-aesthetic notion of individuation and genius: "Collective civilization has diminished the individual genius" (NPL, p. 193). This "modern" war of the individual artist against con- vention has a long and not easily defined history, which, as we have seen, includes Nietzsche, Spencer, and the Symbolists. Pound echoes this theme and, at the same time, evokes a whole poetic-scientific tradition of phallocentrism, when he equates his poetic and, it would seem, his pedagogic (as well as journalistic) efforts on behalf of new ideas with "the male feeling in copulation": There are traces of it in the symbolism of phallic religions, man really the phallus or spermatozoide charging, head-on, the female chaos. Integration of the male in the male organ. Even oneself has felt it, driving any new idea into the great passive vulva of London, a sensation analogous to the male feeling in copulation. (NPL, p. 207) Sexism aside (and Pound does patronizingly allow "a cognate role to the ovule"), the point here is that modern society, and "scientific thought," particularly, require an infusion of new ideas-new poetic "forms" and "images," as he makes clear, not "Idea." Notwithstanding the self-satisfying characterization of his own role, he here abbreviates his plan of re-vitalizing a worn-out tradition in a way which, as we will see, hardly fits the old genealogical (also "phallocentric") order of philosophy and literary history. He suggests, then, that every epistemological moment is also a sexual one; but, more to the point, both are textual, even "rhetorical"-or Imagistic: I offer an idea rather than an argument, yet if we consider that the power of the spermatozoide is pre- cisely the power of exteriorizing a form; and if we consider the lack of any other known substance in 425</page><page sequence="22">nature capable of growing into brain.... Given, that is, two great seas of this fluid, [in the two lobes of the brain] mutually magnetizes, the wonder is, or at least the first wonder is, that human thought is so inactive. (NPL, p. 207; my italics) It remains to be seen how Pound turns his notions of sexual instinct, poetic genius, and imagistic-as opposed to abstract- thought into a "theory" of textual transmission, if not a deconstruc- tive reading of literary history. We should turn again to his "Translator's Postscript" and to its extended scientific-physiological metaphors, which he used in order to intervene in scientific method and the humanistic tradition. IV Pound's effort to reverse the exhaustion and chaotic dispersal of thought by introducing new images is directed at the triple threat of "modernism," as he saw it: the nihilism of nineteenth-century science, the abandonment of poetry for "the mechanical," and a general preference for abstract thought and language. At one point, he confesses, "I appear to have thrown out bits of my note somewhat at random" (NPL, p. 216). While one is accustomed to such apparent randomness in even his programmatic essays, his "Translator's Postscript" manages to comprehend the major concerns that under- write Gourmont's deconstructive reading program. Moreover, Pound extends these interests to the province of his own rhetorical-tropo- logical-notion of Imagism and to the affirmation, recurrent through- out the whole of his reading text, of culture and especially of poetry as a dissemination of meaning. At no point in this essay does he simply reject scientism for an originary or primordial poetry, or philosophy for a more authentic or adequate expression. Instead, he disrupts-one can say "transvalues" or "deconstructs"-scientific theories and terminology from within, borrowing and bending them to his own literary critical ends. Therefore, he also disturbs the jingoist dreams of nativist "American" poetry and poetics which, notwith- standing repeated denials of formalism, draw the line at such methodological promiscuity. For example, he toys with evolution by suggesting that the process has yet to fulfill itself in the development of a new (poetic?) organ or faculty, which would issue from the spermatic excesses of genius: "Not considering the process ended; taking the individual genius as the man in whom the new access, the new superfluity of spermatic pressure (qualitative and quantitative) up-shoots into the brain, alluvial Nile flood bringing new crops, new invention" (NPL, p. 217). This new "invention" could be either a scientific or linguistic "invention" or a new bodily part or organ. The same "form-creating" fluid or faculty (the "spermatozoide") that produces new images or "thought-forms," he argues, effects the sudden appearance of new 426</page><page sequence="23">organs that advance biological species: "the langouste's long feelers, all sorts of extravagences in nature may be taken as the result of a single gush of thought. A single out-push of a demand, made by a spermatic sea of sufficient energy to cast such a form" (NPL, p. 217). The appearance of this new organ would be an act of the spermatic or "form-creating" brain. By contrast to "natural selection," such "physiological" advances are the results of conscious acts, like reading and writing: "There remains precisely the question: man feeling this protean capacity to grow a new organ: what organ? Or new faculty; what faculty?" (NPL, p. 215). Then, he provides a cryptic answer, which only suggests the poetic or "form-creating" faculty: "What new faculty? Without the ostentation of an organ. Will? (NPL, p. 216; my italics). In lieu of a definition of "Will," he generates a list of things not worth willing-or things which stand in the way of "Will" understood as creative thought: "The hypnotist has shown the vanity and Blake the inutility of willing trifles, and black magic its futility.... Take it that what man wants is a capacity for clearer under- standing or for physical refreshment and vigor, are not these precisely the faculties he is forever hammering at, perhaps stupidly?" (NPL, p. 216; my italics). Pound does not seek, either in poetry or physiology, the moral or hygenic improvement of man. Instead, he might be thought to parody Darwinian notions of progress and simple utility, though his proposed new faculty remains enigmatic. It is tempting to suppose that Pound alludes to Nietzsche's "Will," which is tied up with poetry, interpretation, and the "force" of these. As Joseph Riddel has convincingly argued, his notion of "form- creating" thought nearly repeats section 805 of Will to Power.29 But quite apart from "Nietzsche" and the other possible "sources" we have considered, Pound indicates the tropological character of this faculty-call it "will" or "writing" or "reading." It is the ability, at the exhausted end of the literary tradition and the thermodynamic cycle, to re-turn to poetry and thus save man from the mechanical: In his growing subservience to, and adoration of, and entanglement in machines, in utility, man rounds the circle almost to insect life, the absence of flesh; and may have need of horned gods to save him, or at least a form of thought which permits them. (NPL, p. 209) Here he implies the superiority of mythopoeic (and meta-morphic) to scientific thought, suggesting that industrial man, surely one of Darwin's exemplary specimens, reverses the hierarchy he ostensibly surmounts, returning, through "absence of flesh" and sexuality, to the lowest life forms. This is not to say, however, that Pound calls for a return to a simpler, pastoral life. On the contrary, the new faculty he proposes would seem a most "unnatural" mixture of the senses and certain other knacks for reading and writing. For example, his list of modern prodigies that might advance the evolutionary process and improve culture is a motley assemblage 427</page><page sequence="24">of literary allusions and at least one whimsical "reading scene": You have every exploited "hyper-aesthesia," i.e., every new form of genius, from the faculty of hearing four parts in a fugue perfectly to the ear for money (vide Henry James in "The Ivory Tower" the passages on Mr. Gaw) ... and you have Mr. W., a wood-broker in London, who suddenly at 3 A. M. visualizes the whole of his letter-file, three hundred folios; he sees and reads particularly the letter at folder 171, but he sees simultaneously the entire contents of the file, the whole thing about the size of two domino lumps of sugar laid flat side by side. (NPL, p. 215; my italics) It is noteworthy that Pound has (mis-)defined "hyper-aesthesia," which means the pathological sensitivity of the skin and, by extension, all the senses, as a new "form of genius." This usage is, in fact, consistent with his equation of physiological and aesthetic faculties in the figure of the spermatic brain. Moreover, this passage seems to call for the cross-discursive interests he found in the great literature of the past: if in James he seems to find an "ear for money," in The Divine Comedy he reads a "single extended metaphor for life." Thus, this strange synesthesia, of an ear both for music and money and Mr. W's vision of thousands of facts metonymically referenced in one, is involved, however indirectly and figuratively, in his larger "reading" concerns. Surely, Mr. W's "form of genius" cannot be taken entirely seriously, yet Pound elsewhere praises such concision and retention, if he would put this prodigious "loose-leafing" or filing system to better use than the wood-broker. Perhaps it is too far- fetched to suppose that this file adumbrates Pound's characterization of his own reading text, as in, for example, "How to Read," where he says: "We apply a loose-leaf system to book-keeping so as to have live items separated from the dead ones . . . and we could, presumably, apply to the study of literature a little of the common sense that we currently apply to physics or to biology" (LE, pp. 18-19). A little further on in the "Postscript," Pound again raises the question of the new faculty in connection with reading. If his examples seem more serious, the precise character and value of reading remain unclear. His description of the passive (which is to say feminine) yet evaluative and discriminating nature of reading suggests his own ambivalent relationship to tradition and innovation: The dead laborious compilation and com- parison of other men's dead images all this is mere labour, not the spermatozoic act of the brain. Woman, the conservator, the inheritor of past gestures, clever, practical, and Gourmont says, not inventive, always the best disciple of any inventor, has always been the enemy of the dead or laborious form of compilation, abstraction. (NPL, p. 217) 428</page><page sequence="25">We cannot do justice to the apparent sexual ambiguity of the reading act, but Pound does not maintain a clear opposition between passive and active, good and bad, female and male "reading." Thus, he would seem to suggest, at the very least, that not all "compilation" and "comparison," even of inherited images, need be laborious or unproductive. Notwithstanding his full treatment of spermatic thought and the "ejaculation" of poetic images, Pound does not finally resolve the issue of the relative values of reading and writing, of continuity and revolution. This same indecision troubles his categories of "master" and "inventor" in the reading textbooks and, thus, confirms his notion of "creative thought" as inherently disseminative-which is to say interpretive and subject to infinite, open interpretation. Indeed, his aim in the "Postscript" is to show that science and philosophy, which insist on the clear delineation of sexual and textual differences (on such fundamental "facts" as sexual dimorphism and the generic exclusivity of the various arts and sciences) cannot withstand the force of creative genius. Thus, on Gourmont's authority, he directs his description of the advent of new ideas, as we noted above, against the limiting principle of "reason"; and, in the same gesture, he frees his physiology from "moral" and other discursive constraints: Not considering the process ended; taking the individual genius as the man in whom the new access, the new superfluity of spermatozoid pressure.., up-shoots of the brain, alluvial Nile- flood, bringing new crops, new invention. And as Gourmont says, there is only reasoning where there is initial error, i.e., weakness of the spurt, wandering search.... This is a question of physiology; it is not a question of morals and sociology. (NPL, p. 218) In this way, Pound challenges the inherent nihilism of the "new sciences" of geology and biology, which subscribed to the notion that man and the physical universe had nearly arrived at the end of the evolutionary and thermodynamic lines-an end ironically near some apex-and were beginning their abrupt decline. He tries to reverse this entropy, not only by proposing new biological developments, but by holding out the possibility that "enough energy" remains from "the thermodynamic cyclone" to allow "vegetable" or "form-creating thought" through the "cracks left by the earth's cooling process" (NPL, p. 217). Thus, he does not reject the reigning scientific as- sumptions, he merely takes them a step further, as it were, and into an argument for the overcoming of science. His richly figurative account of the redemption of science by poetry becomes a rhetorical critique of the abstract and imprecise ("en-tropic") language of science: for example, he distinguishes imaginative-even imagistic- thought from ratiocination which he characterizes, playing on the double sense of "ratios," as "the least common denominator of a mul- tiple of images." I quote the passage which contains this comparison 429</page><page sequence="26">at some length, because it typifies the variety of tropes he deploys against abstraction-including puns, cliches, comically mixed meta- phors, and folk etymologies, or all those things generally avoided by serious critics: We have the hair-thinning "abstract thought" and we have the concrete thought of women, of artists, of musicians, the mockedly "long-haired," who have made everything in the world. We have the form- making and the form-destroying "thought," only the first of which is really satisfactory. I don't wish to be invidious, it is perfectly possible to consider the "abstract" thought, reason, etc., as the comparison, regimination and least common denominator of a multiple of images, but in the end each of the images is a little spoiled thereby, no one of them is the Apollo, and the makers of this thought have been called dry as dust since the beginning of history. (NPL, p. 211; my italics) Basing arguments on such questionable "evidence" as the physio- gnomic cliches of "long-haired" and "dry as dust" is, in fact, typical of Gourmont's biology, which marshalls literary allusions and "the common wisdom" against the self-important seriousness of modern philosophy. Pound continues this rhetorical attack on science by juxtaposing his privileged images with the abstract language of "science," which has failed to grasp the underlying Truth of poetry- failed, for example, to recognize the value of even the merest traces of a whole complex of symbols and gods from the phallic religions he also cites as common source, equal with biology, for his metaphor of the "spermatic brain" and the cliches or dead metaphors he prefers to abstract or philosophical thought. Yet, Pound also repeats one of the oldest metaphysical arguments: that language, and hence all the discourses of men, fell from the unity of an originary Poetry into the various arts and sciences that only approximate Truth. In the "Retrait of Metaphor" Derrida links philosophy's nostalgia for, and repression of, figurative (or "poetic") language with the most powerful of Western figures, the sun, which is also the "helio-trope," or Apollo, the Greek sun god. Perhaps not entirely accidentally, then, Pound invokes Apollo against the abstract language of philosophy and science. It would seem, then, that his talk of "horned gods," "Apollo," and "the beginning of history" affiliates him with the Western (onto-theo-logic) philosophy he criticizes. Moreover, he seems intent on recuperating an originary or Natural poetry-even an organic one, grounded in the very blood and sperm of man and thus before language. Nevertheless, this return to the primordial, to Poetry, or Truth is everywhere frustrated by the proliferation of images and, what is more important, by his insistence on this excess. Thus, while he might have missed the allusion out of context, "Apollo" is the name of one of Gourmont's favorite butter- flies as well as the Roman name of the Greek god. 430</page><page sequence="27">Moreover, Apollo is not the only god Pound invokes; in fact his strange mythology involves a certain excess: an intervention of the poetic in science and philosophy, which sometimes goes under the name of Dionysus-even Proteus. In this way, Pound suggests a poetics in which the Apollonian and Dionysian are inextricably interwoven at the (non-)origin of poetry and/or in the textures of a "form-creating thought." He introduces Dionysus or Bacchus, the horned god, as a resistance to entropic modern thought, which "badly needs horned gods.., or at least a form of thought which permits them" (NPL, p. 209). This "thought" would necessarily involve the two aspects of intellection which Pound, following Nietzsche almost to the letter, calls "form-creating" and "form-destroying." This ambiguous "force," at once abolishing any constraints placed on poetry and creating or casting out more poetic images than any one text can master, recurs several times in The Cantos and, perhaps not altogether fortuitously, under the (dis-)guise of the horned god(s)-or the transformational Zagreus, Dionysus, Digones, Bacchus. For instance, in "Canto II," Pound re-launches his (Apollonian?) epic by switching from Homer's ships to Ovid's bark, which transports an unthinkably metamorphic cargo of quotations, translations, and inter- pretations superadded to the transformational stories of Golding's Metamorphosis. This "drunken boat," as it were, carries the god of wine away from his "home" in Naxos, but this delay or detour enables the irrepressible force of sexuality and creativity to generate the uncontainable poetic images that comprise Pound's poem and reflect-or refract-(his counter-)tradition. In spite of the sailor's efforts to enchain him, Dionysus creates a new text out of an old figuration: And where was gunwale, there now was vine-trunk And tenthril where cordage had been, grape-leaves on the rowlocks. Heavy vine on the oarshafts, And, out of nothing, a breathing, hot breath at my ankles, Beasts like shadows in glass, a furred tail upon nothingness. ("Canto I1": 8) Thus, through a palimpsest of texts-even of "shadows in glass," but hardly with the alleged self-reflexive transparency of a "mirror held up to nature"-Dionysus marks one of The Cantos's epistemological yet textual moments of "form-creating" and "form-destroying" thought. In this way, Gourmont's text and Pound's "Translator's Post- script" work, in conjunction with Pound's other reading notes and textbooks, not only to produce a reservoir of definitions-or "dissoci- ations"-that make poetic metaphors out of biological metaphors; these tend to produce translative effects that resonate in his later poetry and prose. This is hardly a "closed economy" or systematic theory, of either the Image or the long poem, not a method either for "reading" or "writing." Rather, it can be thought to illustrate the 431</page><page sequence="28">sudden "out-spurts" and "alluvial Nile floods" of a spermatic economy, something like that which Derrida has come to call "dis- seminative" translation.30 As might be expected from definitions which partake of the force they describe, examples of his cross-referencing proliferate (as in Derrida's rhetorical analyses which generate tropes more meta- phorico), but one more example will suffice to show the coincidence of Dionysian thought and Pound's efforts to complete science and mathematics by a reinfusion (and reinscription) of poetry. The definition of "creative thought" we looked at earlier equates mathe- matical with poetic "genius," but this genius exceeds both discourses: "Creative thought has manifested itself in images.... The thought of genius even of mathematical genius... is really the same thing, it is a sudden out-spurt of mind . . . which creates the answer and baffles the man counting on the abacus" (NPL, p. 212; my italics). Years later, in a passage from Thrones which catalogues the virtues of medieval numismatics, Pound recalls the disruptive calcu- lation; again, the god of wine plays with the imagination or, better, disrupts grammar with the poetic: a gold Bacchus on your abacus Henry Third's second massacre, wheat 12 pence a quarter that 6 4/5th pund of head be a farden Act 51, Henry Three. If a penny of land be a perch that is grammar nummulary moving toward prosody. ("Canto XCVII": 671; my italics) Such "associations" illustrate, however freely or illogically, the workings of Pound's "reading machine" which operates accord- ing to the imagistic economy it defines. We cannot claim that Pound raises the spermatic model of textual production and transmission to the level of theory (one which could, after all, be nothing more than the impossible hybrid of a "meta-metaphorics"). Yet it is possible to see his "form-destroying" rhetoric, as a kind of Nietzschean "force," undoing the God of grammar with the gods of transformation. Pound's casual Dionysus repeats Nietzsche's distinction between the Apollonian and Dionysian, that is, between the god who creates forms and the god who unleashes the metamorphic force out of which forms are created. Not unlike Pound's, Nietzsche's formulation inscribes the Apollonian in the Dionysian (or is it the other way round?): Apollonian intoxication alerts above all the eye so that it acquires power of vision. The painter, the sculptor, the epic poet are visionaries par excellence. In the Dionysian state, on the other hand, the entire emotional system is alerted and intensified; so that it discharges all its powers of representation, imagination, transfiguration, transmutation, every 432</page><page sequence="29">kind of mimicry and play-acting, conjointly. The es- sential thing remains the facility of metamorpho- sis.... It is impossible for the Dionysian man not to understand any system of whatever kind, he ignores no signal from the emotions, he possesses to the highest degree the instinct for understanding and divining, just as he possesses the art of communi- cation to the highest degree. (TI, p. 73; my italics)31' Nietzsche's "Dionysian man" appears the very summa of instinct and understanding, inarticulate emotion and critical acumen, that Pound described as the cultural instinct which culminates art and intellection. And Nietzsche's Dionysian "discharges"-in an "out- spurt" of signs, of semes, if not semen-the figurative power of language in a virtual anthology of tropes. His rhetoric-which he ironically calls "metamorphosis," or that which cannot be present- to-itself, an "essential thing," or that which must be-dismantles all notions of re-presentation: "imagination, transfiguration, trans- mutation, every kind of mimicry." If Nietzsche's account seems more explicitly aesthetic-or, more exactly, a rhetorical critique of (Wagner's) "philosophical art" and systematic (Hegelian) aesthetics-than Pound's physiology of style, the "Postscript" nevertheless addresses the same (?) unaccountable dissemination of images: Thought is a "chemical process" in relation to the organ, the brain; creative thought is an act like fecundation, like the male cast of the human seed, but given that cast, that ejaculation, I am perfectly willing to grant that the thought once born, separated in regard to itself, not in relation to the brain that begat it, does lead an independent life much as a member of the vegetable kingdom, blowing seeds, ideas from the paradisal garden at the summit of Dante's Mount Purgatory, capable of lodging and sprouting where they fall. And Gourmont has the phrase "fecundating a generation of bodies as genius fecundates a generation of minds." (NPL, p. 210; my italics) Here Pound is dangerously close to unsettling the old phallocentrism or paternalism he elsewhere seems so comfortable with, transvaluing the genetic model of tradition. Dissemination disrupts the orderly transfer of texts from classical writer to modern reader, as from father to son. With the same gesture, Pound unsettles the conventional notion of the organic or "vegetable" which inscribes a self-contained network of ideas. For Pound, the highest Art is unpredictable and uncontainable: the element of continuity, whether "spermatic thought" or the "luminous details" of Dante's poetry, is also the vehicle of change-and the medium of exchange. But this is not to say that Pound's notions of "reading" and Kulchur, however 433</page><page sequence="30">de(con)structive they might be of Eliot's "Tradition," are either immune to change or fully open to it.

William Cookson (New York: New Directions,1973), p. 415 (hereafter cited as SP); originally appeared as "Remy de Gourmont," Fortnightly Review, 1915, a memorial essay written shortly after Gourmont's death. Further references to Pound's writings will be cited hereafter as follows: ABCR, ABC of Reading (New York: New Directions, 1960); GK, Guide to Kulchur(New York: New Directions, 1970); LE, The Literary Essays of Ezra Pound, ed.

This essay, "Remy de Gourmont: A Distinction," Pound's longest study of Gourmont, first appeared in the 1919 Gourmont issue of Little Review; in 1920 it appeared in Instigations, as a companion piece to a long essay on Henry James, whom Pound saw as the antithesis of Gourmont, that is, a dispassionate observer in contrast to the active and sensuous Frenchman -though both men represented European "civilization." Years later, in a letter to Katsui Kitasomo, October 29, 1940, Pound reflected on his possible misinter- pretation of Gourmont's suggestion: " 'Conquerer [sic] I'Amerique n'est pas sans doute votre seul but' funny trick of memory. I thought he had written civilizer I'Amerique.' That must have been in my note to him" (LE, p. 347). Pound's memory seems indeed to have failed him, though one does not know what he has forgotten, and there is no recourse to an original intention or document-whether Gourmont's or Pound's. In any case, in 1915, he had quoted Gourmont as saying "Conquerir I'Americain," while the later citation has not only "civilizer" but also "I'Amerique." 3 Pound, SP, p. 417. 4 Untitled review of Richard Aldington's two volume translation of Gourmont's selected writings, Dial, 68 (January 1929), 71. 5 Pound goes beyond-or stops before-the claim that (any one of) his critical or art historical readings will totalize the cultural text. Instead, he says, in Guide to Kulchur and elsewhere, "poetry is totalitarian in any confrontation with prose." This cuts both ways: stopping the inherent tropology of poetry to erect Poetry into the mastering discourse or, what might be more frightening, giving poetry and rhetoric absolute control simply because they escape the rigors of system and the responsibilities of community. Such a poetics might produce certain Fascist dreamworks, forming the basis for a totalitarian art. Pound sometimes privileges both sorts of totalitarianism, but in such a way as to achieve their undoing; his neo-Nietzschean readings, his chaos of inter- pretation, point up the folly of his own nostalgic desires. 6 William Carlos Williams, "Prologue" to Kora in Hell: Improvisations, in Imaginations (New York: New Directions, 1970), p. 26 (hereafter cited as Imag). 7 Pound distinguished Gourmont from the more popular Symbolists on the basis of his critical acumen and pedagogic utility: "There are few enough people in this stupid little island who knew anything beyond Verlaine or Baudelaire-neither of whom is the least use-pedagogically, I mean. Whereas Gautier and Gourmont carry forward the art itself, and the only way one can imitate them is by making more profound your knowledge of the very marrow of art" (LE, p. 23). 8 See Richard Seiburth, Instigations: Ezra Pound and Remy de Gourmont (Cam- bridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1978). This generally adequate source study fails to 434</page><page sequence="31">note "Dissociation" in Pound's later criticism. According to Seiburth, The Natural Philosophy of Love (1922) "closed Pound's Gourmontian decade" (p. 24). Elsewhere I have dealt with the neglected later texts which suggest that Pound never abandoned his earliest critical formulations and borrowings, including Gourmont's "dissociations." 9 Remy de Gourmont, "Herbert Spencer," Epilogues: Reflexions sur la vie, 1902-1904, 3rd series, 3 vols. (Paris: Mercure de France, 1905), pp. 244-45, my emphasis. 10 Such figures as the "bricoleur" and the "flaneur," the "shuffler" or "amateur" and the "stroller," who wander through texts and cities collecting ideas have a long history in French literature and philosophy. Montaigne was a sort of bricoleur; the most obvious literary examples are Bouvard and Pecuchet who also reject the modern writer's task of disrupting "accepted ideas." More recently, Derrida has associated the figure of the bricoleur with Levi-Strauss, the self-reflexive anthropologist who positioned himself somewhere between the roles of "bricoleur" and "engineer" and whose reflections on the art of anthropology offer a "myth of mythology," at least by Derrida's account. See Of Grammatology, pp. 103-09. Walter Benjamin links the flaneur, especially Baudelaire as writer-spectator in the Paris streets, with Poe's "Man of the Crowd" as symbols of the isolation of the writer in the modern city, but this writer also weaves together the fragments of modern life into poems and stories which "read" modernism. See Benjamin's Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric Poet in the Age of High Capitalism. Benjamin, who, like Nietzsche, was a German displaced in Paris, and Derrida would have to be taken into consideration in a full-length study of "French thought" and "the intellectual." 11 Pound, Dial 69 (Sept. 20), 220. Ignored by the Poundians, these fragments are, nevertheless, a major part of Pound's efforts to help the Dial civilize America. In fact, the Dial letterhead of the early 20s, on which Pound wrote any number of letters, advertised that "during 1920-21 the unedited writings of REMY DE GOURMONT" would appear in that magazine. Gourmont's name was printed in bold capital letters at least ten times larger than the small capitals used for such stellar contributors as Valery, Croce, Proust, Joyce, and Pound. 12 In a forty-one page preface to ABCR, which was part of the never-published "To Publishers' edition" (Zukofsky's company with the challenging and pre- positional title addressed TO the publishing trade), Pound explains the apparent "disappearance" of Gourmont, whose works nevertheless serve as "levers" and "fulcra" to more popular books: "Gourmont's livre des Masques does its work and goes into the archives/ the levers and fulcra used to get certain books thru the press, all this belongs to the records; to be looked up and verified now and then; but has no need to be kept in circulation or considered as READING MATTER for a new generation." "Notes Toward a Preface," Beinecke (p. 30). Pound continued to recommend Gourmont's books to the many poets he sent reading lists. 13 In current usage, "entropy" denotes the amount of randomness or disorder ("random noise") in any system conducting energy or information. In its thermodynamic usage, coined in 1865, by the German physicist, Clausisus, it meant "transformation-contents" [Verwandlunginhalt], or the transformation of thermal energy into useful work (Oxford English Dictionary). The result of this law or teleological fiction is "universal entropy," the nihilistic vision of nineteenth-century science. Further, as Derrida has suggested, in "White Mythology," "en-tropy," the absence of linguistic tropes, became an important theme in aesthetics and epistemology at about the same time the thermo- dynamic theories were advanced in geology and physics. Moreover, both the OED and Webster's Collegiate cross-reference "entropy," the physical principle, and "trope," or figure of speech. 14 Friedrich Nietzsche, The Will to Power, trans. Walter Kaufmann and R.J. Hollingsdale (New York: Vintage Books, 1968), p. 291 (hereafter cited as WP). 435</page><page sequence="32">Further references to Nietzsche's writing will be cited hereafter as follows: BT, "The Birth of Tragedy," in The Birth of Tragedy and the Case of Wagner, trans.

Walter Kaufmann (New York: Vintage Books, 1974). 15 Several critics have noted, yet left unexplored, Gourmont's debt to Nietzsche. Kenneth Burke's cryptic remark is typical: "[Gourmont] recognized that Nietzsche was one of the most important moralists of the time," and further, "there is Nietzsche in every sentence that he wrote," Counter-Statement, p. 27. Burke's own method of "perspective by incongruity," which he described as "verbal 'atom cracking,' " owes something to Gourmont's "dissociation." 16 Remy de Gourmont, "La Mort de Nietzsche," Epilogues: Reflexions sur la vie, 1899-1901, 2nd series, 3 vols. (Paris: Mercure de France, 1904), 11: 186. 17 Martin Heidegger, Poetry Language Thought, trans.

In his own expose of the "moral origin" of epistemology and all metaphysics, in WP, Nietzsche positions himself within a sort of museum, or magic castle, which is his own perspectival "self," equipped with many windows that change the appearance of Truth: "Deeply mistrustful of epistemology, I loved to look out of this window now out of that, I guarded against settling down with any one of these dogmas, considered them harmful-and, finally, it is likely that a tool is able to criticize its own fitness" (WP, p. 221). This passage bears comparison with Heidegger's "Dwelling Building Thinking" (and with Gourmont's various houses and museums). We should recall that in CW, Nietzsche parodied Wagner's baroque taste by likening his operas to large, cluttered palaces with huge frescoes comprised of precious bric-a-brac. 22 For the Spencer Gourmont seems to privilege, see Descriptive Sociology, or Groups of Sociological Facts Classified and Arranged by Herbert Spencer, compiled by David Duncan, Richard Sheppig, and James Collier, 8 vols. (London and Edinburgh: Williams and Norgate, 1873-1881), I, p. 54. Even Spencer's more scholarly work, Principles of Sociology, only begins to be critical in the sense Gourmont suggests. Spencer's criteria for scientific acceptability are the utility of terms and the coherence of detail to theory; he finds these things in his favorite traditional philosophers and scientists, and, thus, newly catalogued citations. 23 Writing of Bouvard and Pecuchet, Eugenio Donato suggests the havoc museums played with the nineteenth-century dream of adequate taxonomical representation. He makes the crucial distinction between "human knowledge" conceived on the model of the encyclopedic library and that of the irreducibly heterogeneous and metonymic museum: "The ideology that governs the Museum in the nineteenth century and down to the present has often been equated with that of the Library, namely, to give by the ordered display of selected artifacts a total representation of human reality and history. Museums are taken to exist only inasmuch as they can erase the heterogeneity of the objects displayed in their cases, and it is only the hypothesis of the possibility of homogenizing the diversity of various artifacts that makes them possible in the first place." See "The Museum's Furnace," Textual Strategies: Perspectives in Post-Structuralist Criticism, ed. Josue V. Harari (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1979), p. 221. 436</page><page sequence="33">24 Linking Pound, Nietzsche, and Derrida with a pun on "seme" and "semen" and "dissemination," Joseph Riddel has shown that Pound's "seminal brain" is a trope of trope or of cognition, suggesting that "turn of mind" that produces "images." See "'Neo-Nietzschean Clatter': Speculation and the Modernist Poetic Image." 25 Roscoe edited the second edition of Pound's translation of The Natural Philosophy of Love (New York: Liveright, 1932). 26 Aldington says that "the theory of the transvaluation of values must have been very welcome to a man who delighted to find as many sides of a question as possible." Further, he credits Spencer with providing Gourmont the "intel- lectual constant," in the form of the quest for a synthetic method, that underwrites his various literary and scientific researches. Remy de Gourmont: A Modern Man of Letters (Seattle: University of Washington Bookstore), pp. 8, 15. 27 Maurice Blanchot, "The Limits of Experience: Nihilism," The New Nietzsche, p. 126. 28 In a fourteen-page unpublished essay, Pound reflects on Gourmont's notion of instinct, linking this with a "capacity to act." This passage is rather obscure, but it reflects the conjunction of interests and sources Pound developed in Guide to Kulchur: "One's final judgment is 'intuitive'? Or shall I say one's final judgment is made up of a certain number of formulatable reasons and a certain penumbra of imponderabilia. Everything that I write on this subject must be taken with the context of Gourmont's Physique de I'Amour and of Fenollosa's essay on the Chinese written character." In Gourmont's exposition instinct is not something opposed to intellect. Intellect is a sort of imperfect forerunner. After the intellect has worked on a thing long enough the knowledge becomes faculty. There is immediate perception or capacity to act instead of a mass of ratiocination." See "Further Exposition," unpublished essay, Beinecke, p. 13. 29 Riddel, " 'Neo-Nietzschean Clatter,' " p. 220. 30 Recently, an historian of science, Ben Barker-Benfield, made the point that "the spermatic economy" was a commonplace of the nineteenth-century American eugenics movement. Nearly every textbook for young boys addressed such issues as the relationship between reading and masturbation, the production of sperm and the study of poetry. In contrast to Pound, these manuals treated the spermatic economy as "closed" and hygenically controllable. Ideally, which is to say "moralistically," young boys were to be kept from the very excesses and imbalances Pound encourages under the name of "creative thought." Benfield's work is a suggestive beginning, especially "The Spermatic Economy: A Nineteenth Century View of Sexuality," The American Family in Social-Historical Perspective, ed. Michael Gordon (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1978), pp. 336-78. In "Border Lines," a note to the translator which runs the length of the essay it presumably explains, "Living On," Derrida practices and defines "disseminative translations": "By making manifest the limits of the prevalent concept of translation (I do not say of translatability in general), we touch on multiple problems said to be of 'method,' of reading and teaching. The line I seek to recognize within translatability, between two translations, one governed by the classical model of transportable univocality or of formulizable polysemia, and the other, which goes over into dissemi- nation-this line also passes between the critical and the deconstructive," "Living On/Border Lines," Deconstruction and Criticism (New York: Seabury Press, 1979). "Polysemy" and "dissemination" bear an obvious connection to the notion of "spermatic economy"-and should be explored with regard to Pound's deconstructive "translation." 31 Twilight of the Idols or Gotzen-Dammerung (1889), the last book Nietzsche saw through publication, is a subtle parody of Wagner's apocalyptic vision and his canonization-even "deification"-by the Wagnerites. "G6tzen," which means 437</page><page sequence="34">idols or graven images, suggests the direction of his argument, but even more telling is Nietzsche's self-re-assessment. For example, he claims that the terms "Dionysian" and "Apollonian" were his first "transvaluation" and that his own Dionysianism dates from The Birth of Tragedy, a text which he claims was pro-Wagner and anti-Wagnerian from its inception (p. 110). Along with Ecce Homo and Will to Power, this text provides Nietzsche's most compelling deconstruction of "modernism" and "philosophical art." There he connects God and grammar, which together, as Logos, form the philosophical epistem6, if not Darstellung, that he uncovers in ontology and epistemology alike. 438</page></plain_text>
