<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hegel, Tillich, and the Secular Merold Westphal The times are out ofjoint. Technologically we are living in the twenty- first century, while in many respects we are still living in the nineteenth century intellectually. It may thus be the case that the renewed interest in Hegel is less a fad for bored intellectuals than the discovery of his contemporaneity. He is timely not because he has answers to our new problems but because he poses the old unanswered questions so force- fully and imaginatively. This is most often seen, with the help of Marxist studies, in relation to political questions. But it is no less the case in theology. No doubt the most encompassing and most problem- atic horizon in which theological questions are posed today is the one designated " God and Secularity." But of course this was already true of the Enlightenment, and it should come as no surprise that the issues singled out by this phrase are absolutely central, not just to Hegel's philosophy of religion, but to his philosophy as a whole. My purpose here is to describe Hegel's treatment of this problem, compare it with Tillich's contemporary encounter with the same issues, and examine briefly the dilemma on whose horns they seem to be impaled. I. THE TRAGEDY OF MODERN DUALISM Hegel's secondary education has been described as classical in sub- stance and enlightened in form.' What the fascinating documents known as his Early Theological Writings record is the process in which he came to sense an irreconcilable tension between that form and content, between his beloved Rousseau and his beloved Sophocles. His early critique of Christianity as a positive religion, the corruption of the religion of Jesus who taught that man's worth lies entirely in his morality and that morality is grounded in self-legislating reason, shows only that he has read his Lessing, Rousseau, and Kant. 223 1 Karl Rosenkranz, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegels Leben (Berlin, I844), p. Io.</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion But this stance is soon replaced by another which judges the En- lightenment as harshly as Christianity, this time by the standard of Greek cultural beauty. Whereas the "early" young Hegel insists that religious liberty is a civil right and, like a good Aufklirer, calls for the total separation of church from secular state, the "late" young Hegel concludes his analysis of the spirit of Christianity bemoaning the fact that "between these extremes which occur within the opposition between God and the world, between the divine and life, the Christian church has oscillated to and fro, but it is contrary to its essential character to find peace in a nonpersonal living beauty. And it is its fate that church and state, worship and life, piety and virtue, spiritual and worldly action, can never dissolve into one." 2 This statement formulates the philosophical problem which occupies Hegel from the time he wrote it, around I8oo, until his death in 1831. Conquering this fate of Christianity represents the motive of his entire philosophical project, including even the Logic. It will pay us to examine the statement carefully. The first thing to notice is that Hegel interprets the split between sacred and secular in terms of tragedy, as his use of the term fate suggests. And he interprets tragedy in line with the famous statement of Anaximander: "It is necessary that things should pass away into that from which they are born. For things must pay one another the penalty and compensation for their injustice according to the ordinance of time." The social whole is a totality which essentially is the equi- librium of different powers, elements, or spheres. For example, the family and the state, while different, are internally related; the family as the foundation of the state, and the state as the fruition of the family. But an actual society is not a pure essence. (Hegel is not always the essentialist Tillich finds him to be.) It is a living substance in which action takes place. As such it falls out of equilibrium through the one- sided affirmation of one sphere against another, and the equally one- sided reaction of the latter, as violation leads to revenge. Thus in Hegel's favorite tragedy, the Antigone of Sophocles, the clash between Antigone and Creon is not between post-Socratic individuals, but between the family and the state. Since the rights of both are genuine, 224 2 Hegels Theologische Jugendschriften (HTJ), ed. Nohl (Tuibingen, 1907), pp. 180-99, 342. English translation, T. M. Knox, On Christianity: Early Theological Writings (New York, 1961), pp. 1o4-29, 30o 1. Actually the earliest of these writings, the fragments on "Folk Religion and Christianity," which are not in the English translation, belong as much to the "late" as to the "early" young Hegel.</page><page sequence="3">Hegel, Tillich, and the Secular but neither is absolute, both combatants are ultimately destroyed and the absolute right, the subjection of both partial rights to equilibrium in the whole, is restored by that justice which is fate.3 Following Sophocles, Hegel sees this conflict between family rights and state rights as a conflict between a divine law and a human law. Puzzling as this may seem to us, it at least helps us to see how easy it is for Hegel to apply the categories of tragedy to the later conflict between belief (supernatural Christianity) and enlightened insight (the Enlightenment's critique of belief-Ecrasez l'infame). Belief retains the divine content, but without insight, that is, in a form incompatible with the demands of reason's autonomy. Insight upholds this autonomy, but in such a negative and critical way that it loses all content.4 The sacred and the secular have taken residence in radically one- sided agents which confront one another as divine right in conflict with human right. As in Antigone the representative of the sacred is the first to fall, and belief loses its content under the relentless criticism of insight. But now that Creon has dispatched Antigone, the question is whether Creon can survive. "It will yet be seen whether Enlightenment can continue in its state of satisfaction." Hegel's analysis of eighteenth- century secularism follows the tragic script to the letter. Faced with the task of some positive achievement, now that the antagonist is gone, enlightened insight reveals itself to be "merely the rage and fury of destruction." In the French Revolution, its theory of "Absolute Freedom" transforms reality into " Terror." Hegel sees history con- firming his argument that one-sided secularism can only destroy, and, when left to itself, destroys itself.f Hegel's position is clear. Sacred and secular, like family and state, need each other. Both sign their death warrants when they seek to 225 3 Phdnomenologie des Geistes (PhG), ed. IHoffmeister (Hamburg, 1952), PP. 317-42. English translation, J. B. Baillie, Phenomenology of Mind (New York, 1949), PP. 462- 99. For a brief but valuable statement of Hegel's view of tragedy see pp. 428-42 of Robert Corrigan's anthology, Tragedy: Vision and Form (San Francisco, 1965). 4 Hegel's especially vigorous repudiation of his early heroes of autonomy reminds one of Whitehead's description of the Enlightenment as the age of "one-eyed reason" and his claim that "if men cannot live on bread alone, still less can they do so on disinfectants." 5 PhG, pp. 376-422; e549-66I0. (Once the English translation of a given text has been identified it will be referred to only by the lowercase e. Here, e549 is p. 549 in Baillie.) Hegel would not agree with Peter Gay or Ernst Cassirer, whom Gay quotes favorably as saying that the Enlightenment "joined to a degree scarcely ever achieved before, the critical with the productive function and converted the one directly into the other" (Gay, The Enlightenment: An Interpretation: The Rise of Modern Paganism [New York, 1968], p. 131).</page><page sequence="4">The Journal of Religion isolate themselves from the other, and only a tragic spectacle ensues when the problem of their relationship is solved by choosing up sides and slugging it out. But this does not get us very far. It only suggests that history is an endless cycle of violation and revenge in accordance with the cosmology of Anaximander. Is there no escape from the cycle of fate? Hegel's Sophoclean interpretation of the eighteenth century raises for his own century and ours the question of the Oresteia. Can Athene and the Eumenides ever live together in the same city ? Can the one be honored without sacrilege to the other? Aeschylus can only hope. He concludes his trilogy by postulating a peaceful coexistence of the cults of the subterranean hearth goddesses and of Athene as the goddess of the civic domain. But he cannot show why this situation is not precisely that from which another Antigone will arise. Can Hegel do better? He knows that the Greek harmony in which "worship and life are not separated, . . . [and] the temporal life with all its needs-the immediate life-is itself worship " is not an absolute harmony. He knows that because of its immediate, unreflected, and natural character it is always in danger of breaking down, as with Antigone. "Over this sphere there hovers a sense of division which is not resolved, and thus through the gladness of that living unity there sounds an unresolved chord of mourning and pain. A fate, an unknown power, a coercive necessity, unknown but yet recognized, without reconciliation, to which consciousness submits only by negation of itself, broods over the heads of gods and men." 6 Hegel also knows that the external coexistence espoused by Aeschylus and later by Thomas Aquinas is inherently unstable, that it represents an attempt to paper over a rupture which happy endings and clever formulas cannot mend. But beyond the immediate and therefore transient harmony of Greece, and beyond the rupture which has prevailed from the time of its demise until Hegel's present, he sees a third possibility, a new har- mony whose stability rests on its having overcome rather than bypassed the rupture. Because it will be a harmony of reconciliation rather than innocence it will reside in the Christian rather than the Greek com- munity. To be sure, the church has the world standing over against it. But it represents the Kingdom of God, which is inherently universal and 226 6 Vorlesungen iiber die Philosophie der Religion (PR), in Sdmtliche Werke (Glockner's Jubiliumsausgabe), 15:241-42, 25 -52.

(New York, 1962), 1 :231-32, 241.</page><page sequence="5">Hegel, Tillich, and the Secular not only stands related to the secular world but is its truth. And since this truth is found neither in ascetic withdrawal nor a nature-grace hierarchy, it belongs to the Protestant and not to the Catholic church. Hegel's Protestant vision replaces chastity, poverty, and obedience with the divine mandates of the Reformation, family, labor, and govern- ment, or, as they appear in Hegel, family, civil society, and state.7 The true reconciliation of sacred and secular occurs when the opposition "cancels itself in the collective ethical life [Sittlichkeit], and the principle of freedom has forced its way into secular life. And since secular life so constructed is itself in conformity with the concept, reason, truth, eternal truth, it is a freedom which has become concrete rational will. It is in the organization of the State that the Divine has passed into the sphere of reality. Reality is penetrated by the Divine, and the existence of the secular element is justified in and for itself, for its basis is the Divine Will, the law of right and freedom. The true reconciliation whereby the Divine realises itself in the region of reality is found in the ethical and legal life of the State. This is the true disciplining of the secular life, i.e., here the dichotomy between the holy and the moral is transcended." 8 Hegel does not find this reconciliation actualized in the church and state of his day, and he recognized that for this reason his philosophical reconciliation is a "partial one without outward universality." 9 But one can inquire further into its theoretical foundation, the concepts on which it rests as an ideal. II. THE THEOLOGY OF HEGEL S RECONCILIATION If we return to the statement of his fundamental problem, we find that Hegel's diagnosis is not limited to invoking the categories of tragedy. The second and decisive thing to notice is that the tragic dualism is consequent to a particular view of the relation between God and the world. Thus the theoretical solution to the problem of the secular hinges on a new concept of God. This is already clear in the later Early Theological Writings where the Jesus, in whose mouth the truth 227 7 See the Philosophy of Right; and PR, 15:260-61, eI:251. 8 PR, I6:34I-44, e3:I35-38. 9 The final paragraphs of PR, from which this statement comes, are perhaps the most depressing anywhere in Hegel's work. These lectures were given by Hegel four times during his Berlin years, the period during which he is supposed to have been deifying the Prussian state.</page><page sequence="6">The Journal of Religion is put, is no longer the teacher of Kantian morality but the teacher of a new concept of God, according to which the incarnation is a general truth about the relation between man and God. Though both friends and foes misunderstood him, Jesus understood that faith presupposes man's divinity, since only a modification of God can know God. In order to avoid positing any difference between his own being and that of his followers, he declared himself against the idea of a personal God. Rather, he saw the divine as the beautiful life of human fellowship among those who live together in love. He was thus entirely opposed to the Jewish notion of the Kingdom of God, since this implies subordina- tion to a higher power.10 These ideas are developed in the Phenomenology. There Hegel criti- cizes both belief and insight for their views of God. Belief views God as someone over against the believer, a supersensible world. This leads both to a negative attitude toward the actual world and to the projec- tion of its rich contents onto a world beyond, leaving behind nothing but sorrow and the longing for an absent and faraway God. Insight accuses belief of anthropomorphism and superstition. But in place of the theism it criticizes it has only an abstract absolute, a Supreme Being which is a "great void," a "colorless empty being," and an "unknown and unknowable absolute without predicates." This deism is indis- tinguishable from materialistic atheism, and both lend assistance to a utilitarianism which so absolutizes usefulness that even men are subordinated to it, that is, they are used. Thus the entire dispute between theism and atheism is exposed, on Hegel's view, as one between ideologies rendered obsolete by the his- torical developments culminating in the French Revolution and its Terror. Developing his earlier idea that true divinity is found in a certain kind of human togetherness, he points to "a reciprocal recog- nition which is Absolute Spirit.... The reconciling affirmation, the 'yes' with which both egos desist from their existence in opposition, is the existence of the ego expanded into a duality. ... It is God appear- ing in the midst of those who know themselves in the form of pure knowledge." Finally, the Phenomenology concludes with the reminder that "only 'The chalice of this realm of spirits / Foams forth to God His own Infinitude,"' that is, God's reality is not distinct from but is constituted by the realm of finite spirits." 228 10 HTJ, 302-24; e253-8I. 11 PhG, as in n. 5 above, plus pp. 471-72, 564; e677-79, 808.</page><page sequence="7">Hegel, Tillich, and the Secular This is a permanent move on Hegel's part. It is found throughout his writings and is a prominent feature of what can be considered his last work, the Lectures on the Proofs of the Existence of God, given in 1829. In a reinterpretation which he says will be intelligible only to those who have carefully studied his Logic, he here argues that the cosmological proof belongs to the category of substance, not causality, and that it has Spinozism for its truth. To be sure, one must go beyond the philosophy of substance and learn to recognize the Absolute as living and as Spirit, but the Infinite is surely not less than Spinoza's Absolute Substance. Of course this sets aside the entire tradition of dispute about the proof which sees it as an either/or battleground between theism and atheism. Even when God is affirmed in this latter framework and "the finite is mediated through the Infinite, still the converse is not true, which is just the real point of interest." 12 What Hegel is repudiating here is the ontological implication of the doctrine of creation in its theistic context, for which all created beings stand in an asymmetrical relation of dependence on the God who is not dependent on them. He sees this view of God's transcendence as leading to a cultural "Manicheism." "Just as the finite and the Infinite are without relation to each other, so, too, the acts of spirit, its realization of its finitude and infinity, a realization of only the one or the other, have no relation to each other. Even if they happen to exist contem- poraneously.., .they are merely mixed together.... If, accordingly, the manner in which spirit deals with the finite, and that in which it deals with the Infinite, are supposed to represent two different forms of activity, then ... when spirit occupies itself with the finite, it would in turn do this in an absolute way, and be entirely confined to the finite as such." But we know that one can engage the finite in a true way "only in so far as the finite is not taken for itself, but is known ... in its relation to the Infinite . . . [The] religious element in the form of devotion, contrition of heart and spirit, and the giving of offerings, comes to be regarded as a matter apart with which we can occupy ourselves and then have done with; while the secular life, the sphere of finitude, exists alongside of it, and gives itself up to the pursuit of its own 229 12 Vorlesungen fiber die Beweise vom Dasein Gottes, ed.

The advantage of Spinozism over creationist theism, imperfect as the former may be, is that it provides a more adequate theoretical foundation for bridging the gulf between the sacred and the secular. By placing God and the world in a thoroughly reciprocal relation moving in the direction of identity, the possibility of a radical separation of sacred and secular is undermined. Hegel makes fully explicit for us the inner rationale of the remarkable Spinoza revival which coincided with the decline of the Enlightenment. Those who wanted to preserve the autonomy for which the Enlightenment had struggled, but only as something more substantial than the one-sided and militantly antiseptic secularism it had become, sought to restore the sacred dimension and turned to the "holy Spinoza" for guidance. Goethe, in poetry, Schleiermacher, in theology, and Hegel, in philoso- phy, represent the apogee of this meteoric phenomenon. In terms of comprehensiveness and perhaps of depth as well, Hegel must be judged to have carried out the project most impressively. III. TILLICH'S REITERATION OF THE HEGELIAN SYNTHESIS The problem we have seen Hegel struggling with is a perennial one for theology, and we should not be too surprised to find that it was not put to rest by his achievement. In our own time it has achieved not only new attention but widespread popular interest. Theologians, if not entirely at home in such a limelight, have responded with a torrent of literature. Some have concluded that theology can make its peace with militant secularism only by joyfully accepting it as the good news and dispensing entirely with God. To others this seems less like overcoming the dichotomy than simply holding fast to one side, more oblivious than many nihilistic philosophers to the ambiguities of a totally secular world-a world in which mankind, come of age and exultant in the discovery that he is by nature free, discovers that everywhere he is in chains to forces within and systems without which dehumanize his existence. For these theologians as for Bonhoeffer, the problem of a religionless Christianity is the problem of how "to speak in a secular fashion of God," not how to have done with him. It is God who "gives us to know that we must live as men who manage our lives without 230 13 See first reference of n. 12.</page><page sequence="9">Hegel, Tillich, and the Secular God. The God who is with us is the God who forsakes us. ... The God who lets us live in the world without the working hypothesis of God is the God before whom we are ever standing. Before God and with God we live without God." 14 Of contemporary theologians who, like Hegel, have taken the prob- lem of the secular as fundamentally a question about the nature of God, few, if any, have proceeded more carefully or systematically than Tillich. It is the thoroughness of his approach to the problem of God and secularity which merits for his work, rather than that of the recent popularizers, a comparison with Hegel. In referring to his "reiteration of the Hegelian synthesis " I only wish to highlight the striking similari- ties which exist, without suggesting that these exhaust the structure of Tillich's theology or even his relation to Hegel. The Systematic Theology begins with an attack on the supernaturalism of Barthian and fundamentalist theology. Equally determined, if less spirited, is its sustained polemic against the secularism of positivism, historicism, and the dehumanizing domination of technical reason and controlling knowledge. In other words, Tillich, like Hegel, interprets his own situation as a confrontation between a one-sided belief (heter- onomy) and a one-sided neoenlightenment (autonomy). In fact, each of the three volumes begins with some description of this situation as the definitive context of the system. Tillich sees the two sides in a perpetual and tragic cycle in which the one-sidedness of the one side generates a one-sided reaction from the other, which in turn provokes a renewal of the original. In one sense secularist autonomy always wins in a show- down with supernaturalist heteronomy, but the self-sufficient finitude of the former suffers from both a shallowness and an openness to the demonic which keeps it from surviving; and after its self-inflicted demise, the way is once again opened for the ontological and cultural dualism of a new heteronomy. The first Ioo pages of volume 3 reveal how intimate is Tillich's awareness of the ambiguities of a totally secular society. This initial agreement with Hegel is matched by a second, for Tillich envisages another possibility which he calls theonomy. Because religion is essentially the substance or import of culture, and culture is the form of true religion, no essential conflict between them exists. They are not two eccentric spheres but two intersecting dimensions, each of which without the other is not true to itself. The harmonious, ideal relation 231 14 Ronald Gregor Smith makes this point nicely, and quotes Bonhoeffer in so doing (see his Secular Christianity [New York, 1966], pp. I75-85).</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion between the two, for Tillich as for Hegel, preserves autonomy (since the recognition of its depth dimension in no way conflicts with it but only enriches it by providing its forms with unconditional import) while dispensing entirely with heteronomy.15 Third, and again like Hegel, Tillich is largely indifferent to the dis- pute between theism and atheism. Insofar as atheism or naturalism is antitheism, he agrees with its protest against what he considers an unacceptable (blasphemous, idolatrous) concept of God. Like Hegel, who liked to speak of the death of God, especially in the context of the problem of the secular, Tillich, whose sense of rhetorical restraint limits him to the formula "God is real but does not exist," sees the theologian as friendly to those critiques of Christianity which are usually con- sidered most devastating. On the other hand, while antitheism may be a good disinfectant, atheism is not very nutritious food, and, like Hegel, Tillich is critical of atheism for the one-dimensionality which stems from its failure to achieve a more adequate concept of the divine. Finally, and still like Hegel, this attitude toward what others con- sider a crucial dispute stems from the possession of a view of God which is alleged to transcend the mutually dependent deficiencies of the classical alternatives. It is well known that for Tillich God is not a being or even the highest being but the ground of being or being itself. Preliminary answers to the question why this must be so are that as a being, even the highest, God would become just one more entity among the others, while at the same time becoming an object which we might engage in a detached way rather than as subject and the "object" of our ultimate concern. God is the "power of being in everything and above everything, the infinite power of being." 16 If he is not this power of being then he is subject to it as Zeus is to fate. These replies do not seem immediately evident. One could respond that a being is just one more among others if it is a created being, but 232 15 This is not entirely unambiguous. An essential quality of a theonomous culture is "the affirmation of the autonomous forms of the creative process." But this is immediately qualified by the addition of "valid," i.e., it is the valid autonomous forms which are preserved. This is consistent with the fact that Tillichean theonomy does not preserve the autonomous forms of, e.g., positivistic philosophy, but appears to it as an entirely heteronomous enemy. Since this theonomy does not leave secular culture's autonomy entirely untouched, but accepts only what is "valid," it is not clear why (since Barth would say exactly the same thing) this "theonomy" is not just an honorific title for Tillich's own particular heteronomy, just as "ortho-doxy" is frequently a synonym for "my opinion" (see Systematic Theology [ST] [Chicago, 1951, 1957, 19631, 3:251). 16 ST, I: 12, 172, 236.</page><page sequence="11">Hegel, Tillich, and the Secular not if it is the creator; and that a creator is the source of the power of being in everything, but not that power itself, since his power is com- plete independent of that power which he brings into being out of nothing in the free act we call creation. This brings us to the heart of the matter. Tillich's case against God as a being, and thus his siding with antitheism against theism, make sense only in the context of his ontology. It is essentially a Kantian ontology (first Critique) derived transcendentally from experience, and thus an ontology of finitude. To be is to be finite; to exist is to experience the rupture of existence and essence. Relative to the categories of this ontology God would be finite even as the highest being. Since the function of this ontology is to help us get beyond both theism and atheism, it is natural that it should replace the traditional theistic conception of creation with another. It is at this point that Hegel invokes Spinoza, whose Ethics begins with the dismantling of theistic creationism. Tillich's alternative, by contrast, is more nearly Platonic. Creation is the "participation" of the finite in being itself, the Platonic parousia of the essences in temporal existence, the actualiz- ing of the divine life. It is not a free act, since it is identical with the divine life. Like Hegel's Spinozism this view emphasizes the divine immanence, and like Hegel, Tillich wishes to go beyond the pantheistic category of substance to envisage the divine as living spirit.17 It is clear that this ontology and its view of God are the theoretical foundations for Tillichean theonomy. In the absence of the creator of theism there can be no heteronomy, for the supernaturalism presup- posed by heteronomy in turn regularly presupposes the God who creates ex nihilo. The correlation between God's original creative act and his continuing covenantal sovereignty over history as portrayed, for example, in Genesis and Isaiah, belongs to a different set of ontological assumptions. Tillich's God can be counted on not to interfere in human affairs. Just for that'reason it is questionable what dimension of depth he can provide to preserve secular humanism from its own internal dialectic of self-destruction. IV. THE QUESTION POSED BY BARTH AND FACKENHEIM The purpose of introducing Tillich into the discussion is not to expound or criticize his thought as such. A more detailed analysis would be 233 17 Ibid., I: I88-252.</page><page sequence="12">The Journal of Religion required to do justice to its nuances. But even this brief sketch brings to light a deep-seated congruity between his thought and Hegel's which is usually obscured by the fact that his overt references to Hegel are regularly negative. This discovery gives concrete contemporaneity to a question posed by both Karl Barth and the Jewish philosopher, Emil Fackenheim, concerning the Hegelian project. For Barth the astonish- ing thing about Hegel is not his boldness. "The astonishing thing is that nineteenth century man did not acknowledge that his concern in the realm of thought, his basic intellectual concern, had truly achieved ultimate recognition in Hegel's philosophy. It was astonishing that he broke out and made off in all directions, as if nothing had happened, and that he was not content with pondering Hegel's wisdom.... Why did Hegel not become for the Protestant world something similar to what Thomas Aquinas was for Roman Catholicism ?... If the eight- eenth and nineteenth centuries formed a unity in such a way that the nineteenth century was the fulfillment of the eighteenth, then it was Hegel who represented this unity in philosophy as no other man did. ... Is it not Hegel who exploited and made fruitful to the last detail Kant's great discovery of the transcendent nature of the human capacity for reason? ... Is it not he who is above all the great systematizer and apologist for the concern of Romanticism ? ... Was not Hegel he who should come as the fulfiller of every promise, and was it worth waiting for another after he had come? ... If all things do not deceive us it was pre- cisely when it was utterly and completely ruled by Hegel that the new age best understood itself, and it was then at all events that it best knew what it wanted. ... If it is a question of doing what the entire nine- teenth century evidently wanted to do, then Hegel apparently did it as well as it could possibly be done." 18 While it is not exactly true that the remainder of the nineteenth century proceeded "as if nothing had happened," Hegel's project of reconciling sacred and secular through a speculative reinterpretation of the concept of God, which is at the heart and not at the periphery of his system, was abandoned before the ink on his last writings was dry. Its failure is conspicuous not only in that its ideal was not realized, or even increasingly approximated, but also in that it ceased even to be the guiding ideal of nineteenth-century thought and action. One sees the extent to which this is the case by thinking, for example, of Marxian 234 18s Barth, Protestant Thought: From Rousseau to Ritschl (New York, 1959), pp. 268-72. My italics.</page><page sequence="13">Hegel, Tillich, and the Secular politics or Ritschlian theology. "The century had denied its truest and most genuine son and since then it no longer had a good conscience or any true joyousness or any impetus." 19 Fackenheim makes the same point. As the one who radicalized the Kantian imperative-"have courage to use your own reason"-by bringing it into touch with the existential matrix of thought, with history, and in particular with historical Christianity, Hegel is the con- summation of his age. Thus "the Hegelian peace between Christian faith and philosophy is unsurpassable, and marks the end of an era: if it fails, no similar effort can hope to succeed." But his pacification program has failed with such decisiveness that "were he alive today, so realistic a philosopher as Hegel would not be a Hegelian." 20 How is this failure to be accounted for ? Barth suggests that Hegel, in giving classical expression to nineteenth-century concerns, revealed their limited nature, which is to say that the Hegelian synthesis sup- pressed certain problems which rose up to wreak their revenge. Fackenheim says much the same thing when he explains the failure in terms of the way in which Hegelian philosophy presupposes the ulti- macy of "the modern bourgeois Protestant world," which is taken as "in principle final and indestructible," as the seminal form of the Kingdom of God in which free modern rationality comes to concrete fruition.21 In the light of this analysis, including Barth's question, " Is it worth waiting for another after he has come ?" and Fackenheim's answer, " If it fails, no similar effort can hope to succeed," how does it stand with those in our time whose Promethean defiance of history would resist the relapse into a dualistic world of theological positivism on one hand and philosophical positivism or scientism (and other equally one-sided secularisms) on the other? In particular, is not Tillich, who follows the Hegelian program's inner movement so closely, condemned by history to the status of epigone ? Was he indeed born posthumously ? While Barth leaves the question standing by itself more or less rhetorically, Fackenheim, who poses it even more sharply, seeks to resist its implications. "Philosophic thought must move beyond the extremes of partisan commitments, and grope for what may be called a fragmented middle. This is not to suggest a revival of the Hegelian 235 19 Ibid., p. 27I. 20 Fackenheim, The Religious Dimension in Hegel's Thought (Bloomington, Ind., 1967), p. 224. My italics. 21 Ibid., pp. 232-33.</page><page sequence="14">The Journal of Religion philosophy. But it is to suggest that philosophic thought, however rooted in existential commitments, craves a comprehensiveness which trans- cends them. To be sure, this craving can no longer expect, or even seek more than fragmentary satisfaction. Yet it is not doomed to total frustration, and it is unvanquishable." 22 Though there is no reference to Tillich here, it is clear that these are the only lines along which a Tillichean type of project (and therewith any contemporary Hegelianism) could be defended against the ques- tions posed above. Even the wording sounds like Tillich, for he too insists that the New Being and the Kingdom of God are experienced as transcending the estrangements of personal existence and the am- biguities of social life only "fragmentarily" and "by anticipation." 23 From this perspective Tillich seeks to set his program off from Hegel's. He sees the latter as the epitome of essentialist optimism, a philosophy which so concentrates on the essential and ideal dimensions that it overlooks the tragic discrepancies between existing actuality and essential ideality. Thus the acknowledgment of "existential commit- ments," or better, entanglements, and the claim to be seeking only a "fragmentary" realization of the ideal harmony represent a humility which purports to save the Tillichean project from the fate of Hegelian hubris. The difference from Hegel is genuine. It is true that Hegel concludes his Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion with the admission that his own time is filled with such disruption, destruction, and discord as to shake one's assurance that the gates of hell will not prevail against the King- dom of God. It is also true that he does not know how "the actual present-day world is to find its way out of this state of disruption." But he does not doubt that it will, and he does not abandon the confidence expressed in the Phenomenology that the new age is present, has already been born, and needs but to develop out of its infancy. It is as if a wiser and more experienced parent had discovered that the physical and psychological hurdles which a child must leap over en route to maturity 236 22 Ibid., p. 242. 23 The suggestion that Fackenheim and Tillich stand together against Hegel concerns only the specific point under discussion. That there will be important differences between them is apparent from the fact that one is a Jewish, the other a Christian thinker. Furthermore, there will be issues on which Fackenheim finds himself closer to Hegel than to Tillich. In short, since the substance of Fackenheim's pursuit of the fragmented middle is not presented, nothing in the following dis- cussion locates him with reference to the dilemma posed by Hegel and Tillich.</page><page sequence="15">Hegel, Tillich, and the Secular are more formidable than the proud father had realized in the exulta- tion of hearing "it's a boy." But while this difference from Hegel is real, it is of doubtful advan- tage. Tillich is not wedded to the modern bourgeois Protestant world as the embryonic kingdom of God, and much of his finest work is a prophetic articulation of this freedom. But while he is not faced with the embarrassment of explaining how the modern world is even sem- inally the kingdom of God, he faces an equal or greater embarrassment when asked when it will be actualized, when the "by anticipation" which accompanies the "fragmentarily" will be cashed in. His answer is never. The kingdom of God, in which the harmony of sacred and secular is symbolized by the absence of a temple (Rev. 21 : 22) is never anything but fragmentary. In its fullness it is not only not now, but also not ever. Eschatology concerns not promise and fulfillment but time and eternity, that is, every present, but not the future. Tillich's theology is silent about the future, and he himself is pessimistic, expecting the extinction of the human race. This does not mean that Tillich takes the kingdom of God to be nothing but a myth, a regulative ideal, an eternal ought. No more than Hegel is he eager to lapse into the Kantian denial of God's grace as some mode of active power. He insists that the kingdom of God is a power at work in reality and not just an abstract ideal. Why then can God never fully realize it? Apparently because Tillich's eschatology is governed by his Kantian ontology of finitude which knows no actuality which is not finite and estranged from its essence. His God in the final analysis, as the Platonic overtones of his doctrine of creation suggest, is a finite power like the Platonic demiurge, whose attempts to realize the good inevitably encounter an unsurpassable recalcitrance. It looks as if the attempt to escape the dualism of sacred and secular which Hegel calls cultural Manicheism has led Tillich into an ontological Manicheism. This possibility leads in surprising directions. Ontological dualism has always involved flight from the world, such as the Neoplatonic and Gnostic withdrawal from the world of Roman imperialism. If, because of the (temporary) unreality of its reconciliation in the world, Hegel's "philosophy forms in this connection a sanctuary apart, and those who serve in it constitute an isolated order of priests, who must not mix with the world,"24 is not Tillich's theonomy-heaven forbid!-even more oriented toward withdrawal? 237 24 PR, x6:354-56; e3:x49-5x.</page><page sequence="16">The Journal of Religion The question can be pushed a bit further. If Hegel's time is on the verge of "infinite sorrow," 25 is not Tillich's discovery that its condition is perpetual and inescapable the foundation of that despair over the actual which is the last step to Stoic renunciation? The same Tillich whose call to courage so inspired our imagination now robs us of all hope. But courage without hope is the essence of Stoicism. Tillich con- siders Stoicism to be the one serious alternative to Christianity in the modern world. Is it possible he does not know the difference between them ? When is the Kingdom of God? Hegel says now. Tillich says never. Even when all the desired qualifications are added to each answer, both of them prove too embarrassing to be sustained. The one says of the essential structures of the modern world, "This is the best God can do." The other, while not wishing to say that, ends up saying, "I'm afraid he can't do any better." Both Hegel and Tillich are trying to express the meaning of the " already-but-not-yet " understanding of the Kingdom of God which is found in the New Testament, which is why the "now" and the "never" both have to be qualified. But they fail to do so and end up on the opposite horns of an awkward dilemma. Perhaps this dilemma springs from the common ground we have already observed them sharing. Perhaps their inability to make sense of the biblical con- cept of the Kingdom of God springs from their abandonment of the biblical concept of the God who is King. This concept has been briefly intimated already. At its heart is an understanding of God's creative activity and thus his primordial relation to the world which makes it possible to understand his his- torical activity not merely as active presence in the historical process but as ultimate sovereignty over it. It is a concept which does not always express itself in apocalyptic form, but which can do so without difficulty, and which does so in Jesus' proclamation of the kingdom. To say this is to recognize that the essence of apocalyptic thinking is not sensational imagery but a distinctive conception of divine intervention in the historical process. To speak of intervention is to flirt with the specter of heteronomy. It was precisely to flee this that Hegel and Tillich wedded themselves to ontologies which precluded an apocalyptic understanding of the divine kingship. The theology which can lead us beyond their dilemma will be a theology of hope whose ontology is derived from the biblical concept 238 25 Ibid.</page><page sequence="17">Hegel, Tillich, and the Secular of divine sovereignty which encompasses apocalyptic thinking.26 It will be a theology more concerned to understand the biblical motifs of promise and fulfillment than to make its peace with the Enlightenment and its demand for autonomy. This different stance of theology toward the Enlightenment will not be the simple denial of Kant's imperative definition of enlightenment -"have courage to use your own reason." Rather it will stem from having learned, perhaps from Tillich, that there is more than one dimension to courage, epistemically as well as existentially; that in addition to the courage to be as oneself, there is the courage to be as a part and the courage to accept acceptance. If the Kantian conception of enlightenment is one-dimensional in capturing only the first of these modes of courage, the theology of which I speak will seek to cultivate three-dimensional courage. The courage to use one's own reason will intersect with the courage to participate in a tradition (which includes apocalyptic thinking) over which one is not sovereign and with the courage to accept as a gift the revelation of "what no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived." 27 239 26 In continuing to speak of "the biblical concept" I am not overlooking the differences and developments to which biblical theology directs our attention. Rather, the suggestion is like that of Eichrodt's Theology of the Old Testament, that living in and through those differences and developments is a single, unifying core concept which can be recognized. 27 I Cor. 2:9, RSV.
