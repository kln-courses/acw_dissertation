ABSTRACT A volunteer was impacted at velocities up to 4. 6 m/ sec, (15 ft. / sec. ) with a 10 kg (22. 1 lb. ), 15. 2 cm (6 in. ) diameter padded impactor. Force-time, deflection -time and fore e -deflection data are presented for these impacts showing a maximum force of 1. 67 kn (376 lbs. ) and a maximum skeletal deflection of 4. 6 cm (1. 80 in. ). The maximum chest compression is about the same at 4. 4 cm to 4. 6 cm (1. 72 to 1. 80 in. ) at all impact veloci- ties. The fore e -deflection curve reaches a plateau where there is relatively little change in force for a large change in deflection after which there is a large change in force with little change in the maximum deflection. There is considerable hysteresis, and the force drops to zero while there is still appreciable skeletal deflection. INCREASED AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY requires realistic evaluation of injury potential which in turn depends upon the development of an anthropomorphic dummy or other surrogate with humanlike response. Human volunteer chest impact load deflection measurements are presented which will contribute to the de- sign data required for the production of an improved dummy. The obvious limitations to the extent to which human volunteers can be impacted necessitate sub -injury data from this source. Hopefully the low level volun- teer impacts along with more severe cadaver and animal experiments can be incorporated into mathematical and physical models to per- mit accurate human simulation and injury prediction in crash situations. Early research on thoracic impact con- centrated extensively on human cadavers (1-11).* In the early 60 1 s the embalmed cadaver was ^Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. used followed later by unembalmed cadavers. As the techniques became more sophisticated, the vascular system was pressurized on un- embalmed cadavers to approximate invivo pressures and the impacts were applied within a few hours of death in some cases in an effort to achieve results as lifelike as possible. Meticulous autopsies provided accurate meas- ures of injury from the impact with medical scientists combining their talents with physical scientists to attempt to correlate the degree of injury with the severity of impact. Another dimension was added by comparing emergency room injuries to those found in the research cadavers. Relatively few programs using human vol- unteers for chest loading experiments are re- ported in the literature (2, 5, 6, 12). These include impacts and static load deflection measurements. Stalnaker (12) reports on thoracic impacts to volunteers, but stopped the impactor after a predetermined travel so the results are not directly comparable to the work reported herein. Since volunteer impacts must be kept at the sub-injury level, and since the objective of the research is to present a correlation between impact severity and degree of injury, several investigators have resorted to various animal species. The degree of injury in living animals can be obtained as a function of impact severity but the transfer of results from animals to humans has not been achieved accurately. An attempt to find a relationship between in vivo and invitro results in humans has been based on similar studies of impacts to living and dead animals (13, 14, 15, 17). Viano (13) noted good agreement between pig and human cadaver re- sponse under similar impact conditions. EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM Eight impacts to the thorax of a human vol- unteer were made to measure the force-deflec- tion characteristics of the chest under controlled impact conditions. The impacts were produced with a 3 m (10 ft. ) long parallel wire pendulum. The impactor consisted of a 10 kg (22. 1 lb. ) 3181 0096-736X/82/9003-3181 $02.50 Copyright 1982 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">3182 L. M. PATRICK. cylindrical steel bar with a flat 15. 2 cm (6 in. ) diameter impact surface. The impact surface was padded with 2. 4 cm (15/16 in. ) thick Rubatex R310V padding. The volunteer was seated in an upright position on the floor with the center of impact at about nipple level. Forces were measured with a strain gauge load cell on which the 15. 2 cm (6 in. ) diameter padded impactor was mounted. Calibration grids were cemented to the impactor to permit accurate measurements during film analysis. Prior to each impact, the volunteer held a grid board against his sternum in the mid sagittal plane to provide additional accurate measuring capability. A semicircular target of known dimensions was mounted on a piece of plastic contoured to the volunteer1 s back and held in place directly opposite the point of impact with surgical tub- ing stretched around the volunteer's torso. Figure 1 consists of four frames from the high speed movies (620 frames per second) illustrating the deformation of the anterior wall of the chest while the posterior movement is essentially zero. This can be observed by noting that the target mount on the volunteer's back is just even with one of the vertical grid lines on the backboard. During the entire sequence the posterior reference moves very little while the pendulum can be seen to move more than 4. 4 cm (1.7 in. ) into the chest. The Fig. 1 - Frames from high speed movies (620 frames per second) showing the anterior deformation with essentially no posterior chest movement caliper superimposed on the picture with the right hand arm on the center of the target on the pendulum in the first frame indicates a movement of about 1-1/8 times the 3. 8 cm (1. 5 in. ) length of the rectangle mounted on the pendulum. The maximum skeletal defor- mation is 4. 4 cm (1. 72 in. ) from careful analysis of the film. The force was measured as a function of time by the load cell and recorded on a light beam galvanometer oscillograph. The dis- placement of the chest was measured as a function of time from the high speed movies. The difference between the motion of the tar- get on the back and the rigid impactor provides the displacement or compression of the chest as a function of time during the impact. A cross plot eliminating time resulted in the graph of displacement or compression of the chest as a function of the force applied shown in Figure 2. For six of the impacts the volunteer took a deep breath and held himself as rigid as pos- sible during the impact. For the other two impacts, the volunteer exhaled and relaxed his muscles. The purpose of this comparison is to determine whether there is an apprecia- ble difference between the relaxed, expired and the tensed, inspired condition. Pertinent details on each of the eight experimental im- pacts are presented in Table 1.</page><page sequence="3">IMPACT FORCE DEFLECTION 3183 Inches 0 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 18 J r I 1 I I J -1 =1400 X rv ' i'n rv i'n o'' 1 350 T r 4.6 m/s -T T □ ^ r ^ - "" p 1.4" ^ ° -o' ^ s r Pi ^ 7 s ib*£ r Pi ' - 300 / ^ 4.2m/.-V-o' '° A^SV i / ^cr '° , -hi 1.2 ^ ' - i / /o ijf ' I ' 2.4 nvsjR H ; c i / [^' û tv - 250 * Ł / [^' &gt;C I ' I 1.0- ! / i / o 2.4IT1/S-T „/ p( s i/ // □/ r&lt; « ,o Ji / / / ? ~ 200 « ? 0.8 - I ¡°l J fc' 4 ¿ TO •' / / &amp; ft ' c £ ! / 'l / / !

Care should be taken in extrapolat- ing the data to other impact conditions. (1) The maximum force of the impact varies linearly with impact velocities (Figure 3). (2) The maximum chest compression was essentially the same, 4. 37 to 4. 57 cm (1. 72 to 1. 80 in. ), for impact velocities from 8 to 15 ft. per second (Table 1). (3) The maximum force of 1. 67 kn (376 lbs. ) occurred at the maximum impact velocity of 4. 6 m (15 ft. ) per second (Table 1). (4) Force increases initially with deflec- tion, reaches an initial peak or plateau before continuing on up to a maximum peak (Figure 2). (5) At maximum impact velocity, the maximum deflection occurred before the torso moved appreciably (Figure 1). (6) There is considerable hysteresis in the load deflection curve as seen in Figure 2.</page><page sequence="4">3184 L.

At the end of the 4. 6 m per second (15 ft. per second) impact there is still 1. 3 cm (0. 5 in. ) deflection when the force drops to zero. The temporary (about 60 ms. after initial impact), residual zero force deflection is 2 cm (0. 8 in. ) after the 3. 4 m per second (11. 3 ft. per sec- ond) impact, and 2. 8 cm (1. 1 in. ) after the 2.4 m per second (8. 0 ft. per second) impact. DISCUSSION Records for runs 7, 6, 3 and 8 are re- produced in Figures 4, 5, 6 and 7, respec- tively, with the force and deflection for each run tabulated in Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5. The generally increasing slope of the initial part of the record with increasing impact velocity is obvious as is the initial peak or plateau. The same trend is observed in Figure 2 which has the corrected force- deflection character- istics. Large deflections at small change in force in the plateau section are followed by a period where there is a relatively little change in de- flection for a large decrease in force during the maximum deflection period. This may be the result of the ribs bending at constant force, and unloading at constant deflection as the body and pendulum start to separate. The data should be compared with the chest compres- sion of the anthropomorphic dummy as an in- dication of the biofidelity of the dummy. A detailed examination of Figure 1 pro- vides insight into the mechanism of the impact. In the upper left hand frame of the high speed movies, the impactor has made contact and the initial compression of the soft tissue and padding on the impactor has taken place. This is the compression that requires little force. At this point a caliper has been superimposed on the photograph spanning from a point on the anterior marker to a point in the middle of the grid on the impactor. The top right photo- graph is the next in sequence which occurs after about 3. 2 cm (1-1/4 in. ) deflection from the first photograph. The caliper has been placed so the left arm is still in the initial position with respect to the posterior bench mark. In the frame in the bottom left corner, further thorax compression has taken place and the caliper indicates a movement of about 4.0 cm (1. 6 in. ). Finally, in the lower right photograph, the caliper shows the maximum deflection of the skeleton of about 4. 3 cm (1.7 in.). The grid in the background of Figure 1 consists of 10. 2 cm (4 in. ) squares. It is several feet beyond the volunteer and conse-</page><page sequence="5">IMPACT FORCE DEFLECTION 3185 Fig, 4 - Record of Run 7, 2 foot drop, relaxed, expired Fig. 5 - Record of Run 6, 2 foot drop, tensed, inspired</page><page sequence="6">3186 L.

Even so, it will be seen that the left hand caliper arm is positioned just to the left of one of the vertical grid lines in the first photograph in the upper left corner. There is very little movement with respect to this vertical line in the next three photographs. Even this movement is exaggerated due to the geometry of the setup in which the grid board is approximately twice as far from the camera as the volunteer. In Figure 2 the initial force increase to a peak followed by a slight decrease or a plateau is obvious. The 106. 7 cm (3. 5 ft. ) drop has a plateau at about 1. 42 kn (320 lbs. ) after which it increases to 1. 67 kn (376 lbs. ). The 61. 0 and 91.4 cm (2 and 3 ft. ) drops with muscles tensed have somewhat similar increases near the end of the impact. However, for the 61 cm (2 ft. ) drop with muscles relaxed, the force does not increase near the end of the impact. This could indicate a less elastic impact with the muscles relaxed. Correction for deformation of the soft tis- sue covering the rib cage and the padding cover- ing the impactor was accomplished by estimat- ing the tissue thickness and the force required to compress the tissue. The total thickness of the tissue estimated by "pinching" the tissue over the ribs at the point of impact is between 0. 64 and 0. 76 cm (0. 25 and 0. 3 in. ). It was decided to use an 0. 76 cm (0. 3 in. ) deflection at 1. 78 kn (400 lbs. ) with a parabolic force de- flection characteristic for this purpose. Pad- ding characteristics were obtained with pendu- lum impacts to a rigid surface with measure- ments of force and deflection. The load deflection curve was approximately linear in the force range encountered in these experi- ments with a parabolic approximation at the higher force levels. The 2.4 cm (15/16 inch) thick pad was compressed about 0. 76 cm (0. 3 in. ) at 1. 7 kn (375 lbs. ) or the maximum force encountered in the experiments. These</page><page sequence="9">IMPACT FORCE DEFLECTION 3189 data are plotted on Figure 8 which includes a curve summing the two deflections. Compres- sion of the padding and soft tissue is obtained from this curve to correct the data shown in Tables 2 thru 5. The pertinent data pertaining to the volun- teer at the time the experiments were conducted are contained in Table 6. The volunteer was reasonably close to a 50 percentile male at the time the experiments were conducted. He was in good health and probably better than average physical condition for his age. COMPARISON WITH OTHER PUBLISHED DATA It is difficult to provide an accurate com- parison between the results of this and other studies due to differences in the experimental conditions. The other studies include static and dynamic conditions, a few isolated cases where impacts to cadavers and animals were made with the same impactor while in general the impactor s were different, the use of whole body deceleration at impact to a stationary object, padding and no padding, and in some cases the impactor was stopped after a given motion and before its total kinetic energy was expended. Consequently the comparisons will often be general in nature and not quantitative. Many of the results reported include load deflection curves that have the same general DEFLECTION - INCH 0 0. 1 0.2 0.3 0. 4 0.5 2 0 1 1 1 1/ / I 1 / / - 400 // / - 300 w 2 / / 2 2 * / / / / / / O 2 O / / / O O w 1.0 / / § /V " 200 ' y $ ^ ' g ¿y Jy 0.5 - y ¿y Jy 7 _ ioo U „ l^r lili I 1 o U „ o 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 DEFLECTION - MM Fig. 8 - Padding and soft tissue deflection shape that was found in this study (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 16, 17). These curves generally have a plateau with or without slope and often a peak at the early part of the impact followed by a peak near the end of the impact. Also, they generally show a considerable amount of hysteresis. The experiments in which pigs were the subject had a somewhat similar shape to the load deflection curve (13, 14, 15) but the plateau was not as well defined. Where living and dead pigs were used, the injury level was generally noted to be lower in the living than in the post-mortem subjects. Nusholtz, et al, (17) states "In most cases, the forces reach a plateau and continue at that level until the impactor is arrested. " This data is based upon lateral impacts to the thorax of primates. This is somewhat similar to the present results except in the present case there is a tendency for the force to in- crease near the end of the impact. Kroell (7) derived an equation relating the AIS (18) (Abbreviated Injury Scale) with normalized chest deflection. He defined normalized chest deflection as the measured deflection divided by the A-P chest thickness. His data are based upon cadaver impacts. His equation shows an AIS 1 for a 5. 9 cm (2. 23 in. ) deflection, an AIS 2 for 6. 9 cm (2. 72 in. ) and an AIS 3 for 7. 5 cm (2. 96 in. ). The AIS 1 is</page><page sequence="10">3190 L. M.

The AIS 2 is a moderate injury and can consist of open, dis- placed or comminuted fractures of the ribs with or without closed fracture, without flailed chest. A combination of these fractures can increase the AIS level. The AIS 3 is consid- ered a serious injury and includes such things as unilateral hemothorax or pneumothorax and certain combinations of closed, open and comminuted fractures. In addition to the skeletal fractures, injury to the heart, lungs, vessels and other organs of the chest repre- sent different degrees of injury. Reference to Figure 2 shows that the data found in this study do not agree with the equation of refer- ence 7. Figure 2 shows little difference in the deflection of the skeleton for different impact levels. Whether this same condition would apply to more severe impacts where injury occurs is unknown. Nahum, et al, (10) states "Normalized chest deflection continues to correlate well with degree of injury . . . . " Again the correlation of injury is with chest deflection which does not agree with the results of this study within the confines of the impact energy. Stalnaker, et al, (12) reports an average, static chest stiffness of 1. 14 kn per cm (650 lbs. per in. ) under tense conditions and 0.40 kn per cm (230 lbs. per in. ) for the relaxed vol- unteer. In the Stalnaker study the impactor was limited in travel to protect the volunteer from injury. In the present study, the dynamic stiffness was 0. 79 kn per cm (450 lbs. per in. ) at 2. 4 m per sec. (8 ft. per sec. ) and 2. 5 kn per cm (1400 lbs. per in. ) at 4. 6 m per sec. (15 ft. per sec. ) for the tensed condition while for the relaxed condition, the stiffness was 0. 57 kn per cm (325 lbs. per in. ) at 2. 4 m per sec. (8 ft. per sec. ). Both of these studies used a 15 cm (6 in.) diameter impactor. The limited data suggests that dynamic stiffness is greater than static stiffness. The cadaver data from the same study (12) shows a stiffness of 2. 2 kn per cm (500 lbs. per in. ) at a deflection of 7. 6 cm (3 in. ) with rib fractures at this condition. The elimination of soft tissue deflection is considered in the present study while no men- tion of that is made in the other studies. Lobdell (5) reports a volunteer static stiff- ness of an average of 0. 24 kn per cm (135 lbs. per in. ) under tense conditions and 0. 07 kn per cm (40 lbs. per in. ) for the relaxed condition. In that study, the load was applied in approxi- mately 100 ms with the volunteer1 s back against a hard, flat backrest and the force applied through a 15 cm (6 in. ) diameter loading device. The difference between the inertia type loading and the squeeze type loading probably accounts for the gross difference between the Lobdell, Stalnaker and the present data. Kroell (9) notes that approximately 40 to 50% of the impact energy goes into the whole body motion in his cadaver impact. In the study reported herein, the area under the load deflection curve represents 46, 53 and 63% of the input energy at 4. 6, 3. 4 and 2. 4 meters per second, respectively. Assuming that the impactor is stationary, which is approximately correct, after the impact the energy to the whole body motion approximates 54 to 37% of the total energy. It should be noted that this does not represent a rigid body motion transfer and is only a very rough approximation of kinetic energy transfer. The energy to the whole body is in reasonably good agreement in these two studies. It is interesting that the higher percent of energy to whole body motion occurs at the lower velocity of impact. This is probably due to greater muscle control and rigidity of the leg to torso connection at the lower speeds. At the higher speeds, the sub- ject was unable to withstand the force and consequently was violently knocked over back- wards. At the lower velocity, he could control his movement to a greater degree and there- fore absorb more of the load. RECOMMENDATIONS The limited number of impacts on a single volunteer in these experiments does not pro- duce representative data for the human popu- lation. Therefore, it would be desirable to conduct a series of volunteer impacts of this type with a range of ages, sizes and with both males and females represented. However, care should be exercised in undertaking such a program. The volunteer in this series had</page><page sequence="11">IMPACT FORCE DEFLECTION 3191 no undue pain or any obvious injuries. How- ever, after the 106. 7 cm (3. 5 ft. ) drop and measurement of the thoracic compression fol- lowed by an examination of the torso or skele- ton and cross section of a torso, and in par- ticular the distance between the sternum and the spine with the heart located between, it was decided to discontinue the voluntary experi- ments. The heart must move to one side or the other to avoid being crushed between the ster- num and the spine. With the attachment of the large vessels to the posterior structure of the thorax, it was felt that further impacts at greater severity with the attendant heart move- ment could result in tearing of the vessels with the serious injury that would result. This type of injury has been noted in accidents and con- sequently could occur in this type of experi- ment. Additional experiments of this nature should be undertaken only with careful medical supervision.
