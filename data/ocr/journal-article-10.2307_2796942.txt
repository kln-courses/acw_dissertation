Graziosi, I960</page><page sequence="2">THE WOODEN STATUE OF DEZALIK, A KALASH DIVINITY, CHITRAL, PAKISTAN* by PROFESSOR PAOLO GRAZIOSI Institute of Anthropology, University of Florence 183 r The second Italian anthropo-ethnographical 183 nlmission in Chitral was carried out, under my direction, during the summer of ig60.' The aim of the mission was to complete the research which I had begun in I955 on Kafir populations (Kalash and Kati), research whose particular object was the study of the physical anthropology of those people. The ethnographical documentation assembled last year was also rich from the iconographical viewpoint (in photographs and films) and is now under examination. I only wish to make a few advance observations on a document that appears to me of particular interest, since it is described for the first time as one of the artistic- religious manifestations of the Kalash, viz. a wooden statue representing the goddess Dezalik, patron of women in confinement. This divinity corresponds to Nirmali in the pantheon of the Afghan Kafirs, as Robertson knew them at the end of the nineteenth century, immediately before their complete, forced conversion to Mohammed- anism.2 To my knowledge none of the very few scholars who have approached the Kalash up to now have seen the above mentioned statue, and its very existence was gener- ally doubted. The interesting anthropomorphic statues of of the Kalash, placed in the cemeteries or near villages, are all, as is well known, funereal or commemorative. They represent the deceased standing or on horseback, and are then placed next to the sarcophagus, or seated in an arm- chair and soaring on top of a wooden pillar, in which case we find them at the entrance of a village or not far from it. None of the still numerous divinities ofthe Kalash pantheon are represented today by an anthropomorphic image, to my knowledge.3 It was said that an image of the goddess Dezalik was kept in the bashali, or women's house; Siiger had heard of it, but it had not been possible for him, or for any of his col- leagues who had visited the Kalash valley, to penetrate that building, where women are relegated when they are in a state of impurity, i.e. during menstruation and confinement. One day during the month of September, I960, a fortunate circumstance occurred, allowing me to enter a bashali. I was in the Bomberet valley with the other members of the mission and the Mohammedan interpreter who accompanied us, and we passed in front of the bashali of Brun andAnish (Plate Ob). It was about midday and all its inmates were at work in the fields. We pushed the door of the small building and it gave at once, so we entered the dark room where, upon an altar in a corner (Plate Oc), we saw the wooden statue of the divinity who protects childbirth (fig. i). I was thus able to photograph, sketch and measure the statue, draw up a plan of the room, and sketch it and its scanty furniture. * With Plate 0 and two text figures Bashali are scarce nowadays in the three Kalash valleys, and are due to disappear with all the cultural traits of the pagan Kalash, as these are converted to Islam. FIG. I. WOODEN STATUE OF DEZALIK Height 98 cmn. Photograph: P. Graziosi To my knowledge only five bashali remain in the three Kalash valleys: two each in the valleys of Birir and Bom- beret, one in the Rumbur valley. In the Birir valley, the bashali are near the villages of Guru and Gasr Guru; in Bomberet, there is one near Krakal and another (the one which I visited) between the villages of Brun and Anish. Another bashali existed near Batrik, but I was told that it was abandoned long ago and I saw its ruins. In Rumbur, the bashali is located between the villages of Grom and Batek. According to local reports, in the Birir bashali there are no statues of Dezalik, whereas the goddess's image is to be found in the Rumbur bashali. The limited number of bashali is related to the present scarcity of the Kalash population and to the restricted I + I49</page><page sequence="3">No. I83 MAN SEPTEMBER, 196I limits of the inhabited area, which allow one bashali to be used by different villages.4 In the Rumbur valley, where the four villages inhabited by Kalash are contiguous, the only existing bashali can easily be reached by the women of all four villages. The custom of confining Kalash women in the bashali was reported by the few European travellers who visited the three valleys. All reports are in accord, and also agree with the information which I gathered in my two expeditions. 2~~~~ stteIspae; (5 th gdEs Dezli , ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ' , Schomberg, ~ inhswl-nw oo,mnin ahl I 1 FIG. 2. PLAN OF THE BRUN BASHALI (I) Outdoor verandas; (2) entrance; (3) fireplace; (4) altar on which the statue is placed; (s) the goddess Dezalik Schomberg, in his well-known book,5 mentions bashali more than once, and describes the state of strict confine- ment in which women are kept, and the purification rites which a person accidentally entering the bashali area must be subjected to. Siiger, in the short preliminary article on his ethnographical research among the Kalash, gives the same information and lists the rules and way of life observed by the bashali inmates, as well as by the women who attend them. 'The Bashali,' he says, 'the birth house reserved for parturient and menstruant women, can be found in most villages close to the river. This house and its inmates are protected by the goddess Dezalik, whose name is also used for a Yoni statue said to be there.'6 Kalash women are obliged to leave the village during menstrual periods. They are in a most impure state, liable to contaminate all those who come into contact with them. They must therefore spend the night and cook their food in the bashali which, as we mentioned, is outside the village and surrounded by an area forbidden to all. The women remain in the bashali during the whole critical period. Schomberg says that they must spend six days and six nights there.7 The segregation of women during the menstrual period and at childbirth is of course practised among many different peoples. The horror felt for their state, considered impure, leads primitive communities to take all the neces- sary precautions to avoid dangerous contacts between the impure women and all other members of the group. Thus, a woman in this state must not eat with the others, must not touch certain objects or common food or domestic animals, must abstain from certain kinds of food and must comply with other strict rules. The obligation to live in separate rooms of the house or in isolated huts is scrupu- lously observed by many peoples, for example, as Lowie reports, by the Idaho Shoshoni,8 and, to refer to a people of the Indian sub-continent, by Todas, who confine menstruating women in a room behind the house and women in childbirth in a hut in the forest. The same custom is in use, as Montandon reports, 'among numerous jungle populations, which is to say in inferior culture groups, as well as among Ostiaks and Gilyaks.'9 Many other similar examples could be mentioned. To return to the Kalash, the confinement of the bashali inmates does not exempt them from working in the fields or from attending, at least nowadays, collective dances. However, they must not approach other women who are not in their condition. The photograph which we publish (Plate Oa) represents a group of Birir valley women about to begin a dance which we asked them to perform. One can see two girls, at that time in an impure state, seated apart from the others. During their confinement, food is brought to them and left near the bashali, and they cook it inside their temporary abode. Should a man, even inadvertently, pass through the area considered part of the bashali, he is obliged as mentioned above, to submit to purifying rites, among others the sacrifice of a goat. Before re-entering the village, the bashali inmates must bathe in the river. All births occur in the bashali. Often, while I was taking anthropometric measurements, the subject under examination when asked where he was born (meaning the name of his village) would answer, 'In the bashali.' At the moment of childbirth, as Schomberg and Siiger pointed out, an old woman from the village goes to attend the woman in confinement. Before entering the bashali she must undress, leaving her clothes outside the small building, and when her midwifery is accomplished, before re-entering the village, she must bathe in the river, even in the depth of winter. The woman in childbed must submit to complex purifying rites and, for a certain time, to particular limita- tions relating, for instance, to the use of domestic imple- ments. A woman who dies in childbirth in the bashali is buried without ceremony in a secluded area, or in an area set apart in the common cemetery. In the cemetery of I50</page><page sequence="4">SEPTEMBER, I96I MAN No. I83 Brun, the area for women dead in confinement is at the extreme end of the burying ground. The bashali which I had the unhoped-for opportunity of visiting, and which was used by women of Batrik, Brun and Anish, lies half a mile from the last two villages, near the river and at the edge of a wood. The trunks of some large plane trees which grew near the site of the bashali were covered by engravings cut into the bark, representing diamond shapes and hand forms, which appear to repeat the hand forms and white spots painted on the doors of some Kati homes of Bomberet and Rumbur. When I questioned them on the meaning of these engravings, the natives told me that they were only a pastime. This answer did not fully satisfy me. The bashali consisted of a small building with unplastered walls, with only one room and two verandahs, one in front of the wall where the door opened, the other to the left of this wall (Plate Ob). It lacked a hole in the roof to allow smoke to escape, and was not provided with any aperture at all connecting the room with the outdoors. The door was closed by a sliding fold which moved with difficulty on its rails. The interior consists of a dark room 4 70 metres by 4 40, and i -95 metres high (fig. 2). The ceiling is supported by four wooden pillars, roughly squared, placed in the middle of the room at a distance of about i-8o metres from one another. As with Kalash buildings in general, the four pillars support two rafters running along the whole length of the room. On these rest the small beams which support the roof In the centre of the room a fireplace is marked by five stones limiting a pentagonal space 6o centimetres by 55. In the right-hand corner we find a sort of parallelepiped I1-30 metres by I-35 and about 40 centimetres high, built with unplastered stones and covered with abundant ashes (Plate Gb). On this rough kind of altar the crude statue of the goddess Dezalik is placed, in the corner formed by the two walls (fig. i). It is carved from a thick plank of deodar wood and appears like a figure with a carved profile rather than a sculpture in the round. It is 98 centimetres high, 2I centimetres wide and 6-7 centimetres thick. The figure is schematic. The head consists of a diamond shape enclosing another diamond shape, deeply engraved. The shoulders are pointed, the legs rigid, in bas-relief. On the thorax and abdomen three concentric oval figures are deeply engraved. A groove runs vertically down the breast and abdomen of the figure to the groin. Here it widens and forms a triangular cavity enclosing a triangular prominence, also engraved, representing a large vulva. The two legs are separated by a deep, rectangular groove. The statue has no arms or feet. At the extremity of the legs the tree trunk from which the statue was carved continues, forming a kind of pedestal. This pedestal was buried in the ashes of the fireplace. The figure appears to be very old and is covered in soot. On the altar at the statue's feet I noted many bunches of grapes and a basket made of osiers. In the wall behind the statue, at the height of its head, is a rectangular niche and, on the same wall but at the opposite end of the room, a similar recess in which leafy branches were driven, here and there, in the interstices between the stones, in different places of the wall. In the right-hand corner, upon entering, was a schist slab surrounded by stones, probably used to knead chapati. Near it, a flat basket. This is all that I noted in the bashaliof Brun. It appears certain that the small stone building on which the statue was placed is to be considered a kind of altar, for the real, functional fireplace is located, as in all houses, in the middle of the room. Therefore the bashali takes on the value of a proper place of worship, and not only of a confinement building. The presence of grapes and of ashes on the altar of Dezalik speaks to us of offerings made by the inmates of the 'women's house' to the goddess who protects childbirth. To my knowledge, in the whole territory inhabited by the Kalash today there is no anthropomorphic image of any divinity. Other scholars' reports confirm this, excepting Morgenstierne's above mentioned statement reported by Siiger, whereas the statues of Imra and other divinities of the Kafir pantheon are often mentioned by Robertson in Afghan Kafiristan. It might therefore be imagined that among the Kalash of today, a kind of religious aniconism exists, contrasting with the findings in nearby Nuristan. But this theory is evidently contradicted by the existence of the clearly veristic, though greatly stylized, reproduction of the important goddess Dezalik in the bashali of Bomberet. There is much to say on this subject, particularly on the significance. given to the religious manifestations of the Kalash by the existence of an image of Dezalik. But all this will be dealt with elsewhere. For the moment, it is enough to have presented the reproduction of the statue of this Kalash divinity, and to have described it summarily. Notes I was accompanied by Mr. Simone di San Clemente and Mr. Giovanni Verusio, assistant professor at the University of Florence, as well as by three representatives of the Pakistan Government: Mr. Shakur, Director of the Museum of Peshawar, Mr. Idris Sidiqui of the Department of Archaeology of Karachi and a photographer of the same Department, Mr. Sidiqui. I thank them very much. 2 G. S. Robertson, The Kafirs of the Hindu-Kush, London, I900. 3 Siiger states that he was informed by Professor Morgenstierne that in I929, when he carried out his linguistic mission in Chitral, ' a carved head could still be found, looking like a man's head in the hole of one of the shrines' of Mahandeo (H. Siiger, 'Ethnological Field Research in Chitral, Sikkim and Assam,' Historiskfilologiske Meddelelser udvigetatDetKongelige Danske Vedenskabernes Selskab, Vol. XXXVI, Part 2, I956, p. I7) but that 'these heads had disappeared when he visited the Kalash in I948' (p. 32). 4 During this last mission, thanks to the courteous co-operation of Mr. Shakur, Director of the Peshaswar Museum, who accom- panied us on our journey, I was able to have a census of the Kalash and Mohammedan inhabitants of the three valleys of Bomberet, Rumbur and Birir taken by a Mohammedan from Brumbutul village, whom I had engaged for this purpose. From this it appeared that in September, I960, the Kalash numbered I,39I against 2,230 Mohammedans. From information gathered during my previous mission in I955, it seemed that the number of Kalash nearly reached 2,000 at that time. This estimate, if correct, shows the steady progress of the conversion of the Kalash to Islam. 5 Schomberg, Kafirs andGlaciers,London, I938, pp. 45-7, i85, I96. 6 Siiger, loc. cit., p. i8. 7 Schomberg, loc. cit., p. 46. 8 R.
