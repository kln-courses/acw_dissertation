<plain_text><page sequence="1">The French Constitution in Prerevolutionary Debate Marina Valensise Institute Raymond Aron Was there a constitution in France before the Revolution? This might seem a paradoxical question with which to open a study of the concept of constitution in the political culture of the ancien regime, but it cannot be escaped. Bequeathed to the historian by the French Revolution itself, it helps us penetrate the historical archaeology of an idea that after two centuries still affects the political destinies of contemporary regimes. By instituting an ideal order for political life that implied the existence of fixed and constant norms in the manner of governing, the French Revolution invented the constitution as a legal phenomenon. At the same time, it used this new conception of public law to link the concept of ancien regime to the idea of the absence of a constitution. 1 In found- ing a new way of representing the law and the state, the deputies to the Constituent Assembly relinquished the very notion of an ancient French constitution, leaving to later historians the challenge of deci- phering its meaning. The Revolution the philosophical theater and the laboratory of a new public law-inaugurated modern forms of politics, since with the legal idea of constitution it opened up infinite possibilities for the cre- ation and recreation of political order. Through Sieyes "the social art" was discovered, and a dizzying array of its practical applications was tested. Hence the appearance of the relative constitution, understood as the work of political artifice, which permitted the organization of power under the successive forms of parliamentary monarchy, direct democracy, a republic governed by directors, and even a consulate and an empire. Considered theoretically, this now exemplary series of at- tempts to create a public law derives from the totally original character 1 Jean-Joseph Mounier, Rapport du Comite charge du travail de la consti- tution, July 9, 1789, Archives parlementaires, premiere serie (1787 a 1799), ed.

In France, the idea of a legal constitution did not refer to a public act indispensable to the political self-institutionalization of a people made up of colonists emancipated from the mother country. It repre- sented neither an obligatory transition in the emergence from a pre- social state of real liberty and equality nor a contract fundamental to the formation of a new -state. On the contrary, this idea was the am- biguous but far from fortuitous invention of a nation whose political unity had been constituted during the course of a millennium of history.2 It was the invention of a society founded on the inheritance of inequali- ties, a society gathered around a power that embodied and represented it and was transmitted hereditarily from king to king. It was ambiguous, for it was the result both of a tradition and of the denial of that tradition, in that the monarchy itself opened the way for it by calling on the Estates General to reestablish the constitution of the realm in May 1789 only to undergo four months later the conceptual overthrow of this "regime" and the effacement of its history entailed in the Decla- ration of the Rights of Man. But there was nothing fortuitous about its appearance, which had been slowly prepared by the history of the French monarchy. The invention of an abstract and relative conception of a constitution-which the Revolution was to implement, exhausting all its inherent possibilities seemed imaginable only through the prior dissolution of the classic concept of a constitution as anterior to the concept of law, as coinciding with the ordering of the powers of the state, and as defining the mode of existence of a given regime (which was in turn determined by the very form of its government). That the dissolution of this latter concept occurred in France and not elsewhere was-I shall suggest as a hypothesis-the result of the quite particular operation of absolutism on the national juridical tradition. Culmination of the evolution of public law under the monarchy, the idea of a legal order to be given to French political life, was born at the start of the work of the Estates General in an equivocal manner: through a dual reference to a unique national history and to an ex- 2 I use the term "fortuitouss' and the concept used by Alexis de Tocqueville to define the work of the Revolution: "Chance played no part whatever in the outbreak of the Revolution; though it took the world by surprise, it was the inevitable outcome of a long period of gestation, the abrupt and violent con- clusion of a process in which six generations had played an intermittent part (L'Ancien Regime et la Revolution, ed.

On the one hand, the idea appeared as a set of rules to be established for the proper functioning of the monarchy. Under the aegis of Montesquieu, the theme of the balance of powers reappeared. The constitution thus appeared as the reestablishment of a forgotten but living constitution, remote traces of which could be found in primitive Germanic liberties, medieval assemblies, and the tradition of the consent of the Estates of the realm to taxation.3 On the other hand, the constitution appeared as an ideal norm for universal history. While its attributes had been bequeathed by the national his- tory-it was after all the constitution of the French monarchy it was deduced by rational abstraction as far as its content was concerned, for it became the constitution of a new state. Since it required definition less by historical examples than by philosophical principles,4 it cor- responded to an ideal system of just and imperative norms: the natural rights of man and of the citizen. Both those who demanded a new constitution and those who argued for the reestablishment of the old one favored a regeneration of the state. The sole-and principal- difference between them lay in their views of the need for a declaration of these rights.S The revolutionary constitution thus ultimately coincided with the decreed and perfected codification of a political order founded de novo. If representative government was grafted onto the older monarchical form, it was by means of a new constituent principle (the sovereignty of the nation), a new criterion of law (the free and voluntary agreement of the individuals who subjected themselves to that law), and a new representation of society (founded on civil equality). Article 16 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the hypothetical and abstract premise of the new conception of a legal constitution, proclaims: "Any society in which the guarantee of rights is not assured and the separation of powers not determined has no constitution." This article gave the concept of constitution a particular content by restrict- ing the sense of the term to the protection of individual rights from the public power and the distribution of powers. If it gave support to the idea of the artificial and ideal character of a constitution, it also ratified the notion that no constitution existed in a regime that had neither 3 Emmanuel-Louis-Henri de Launay d'Antraigues, speech of May 28, 1789, Archives parlementaires, 8:52. 4 Trophime-Gerard de Lally Tollendal, speech of June 15, 1789, Archives parlementaires, 8:107-8. 5 Stanislas-Marie-Adelaide de Clermont Tonnerre, "Rapport contenant le resume des cahiers, en ce qui concerne la constitution," Archives parlemen- taires, 8:283-85.</page><page sequence="4">Constitution in Prerevolutionary Debate S25 division of powers nor guarantees for the rights of the individual thus simultaneously creating the concept of the ancien regime. Retrospec- tively, this new idea of constitution revealed the absence of a consti- tution in the traditional French monarchy to liberal historiography.6 There the powers that the Revolution wanted to separate were unclearly distributed between a sole sovereign, the king, and those charged with carrying out his will; there the unstable and intermittent prerogatives of the various political bodies gave rise to changing and contradictory usages; there the guarantees of the individual (a notion that was absent, moreover, in the political thinking of the old society) were subject to the whims of a power that, even when it protected its subjects' property, could violate their liberties by a simple lettre de cachet. Not only was the constitution of this ancienne France impossible to locate; it van- ished as soon as the Revolution created a new concept. But this new concept raises questions concerning the old concept of constitution. It prompts study of what that idea represented in the political culture of an epoch that had a different conception of rights and the law than the one created by the Revolution. It poses the problem of understanding why the history of France produced the transition from a classic idea of a constitution as simply the mode of existence of a regime, the very order of the disposition of the different parts of 6 Inaugurated by Necker, the last minister of Louis XVI, this tradition was to continue through Madame de Stael and Benjamin Constant to the republicans of the Second Empire. Necker wrote at length to show the harmful effects of recourse to a supposedly existent ancient constitution on the part of the princes and the nobility on the eve of the royal declaration of June 23 (De la Revolution franJcaise, 2 vols. [Paris, 1797], pt. 1, sec. 1). His daughter, Madame de Stael, repeated his idea of the absence of fixity and constancy in the usages and the institutions of traditional France (Anne-Louise-Germaine de Stael, Conside- rations sur les principaux evenements de la Revolution franJcaise, 3 vols. [Paris, 1818], pt. 1, chap. 11), while Benjamin Constant again inferred that an ancient constitution did not exist from the fact that it had left no trace and founded no customs (Re'flexions sur les constitutions, la distribution des pouvoirs, et les garanties: Dans une monarchie constitutionnelle [Paris, 1814], preface). All these themes were to be reiterated by Edgar Quinet as supporting evidence for his critique of the authoritarian spirit of French political tradition (La Revolution franJcaise, 2 vols. [Paris, 1865], bk. 6, chap. 5). For a critical sum- mary of contemporary studies of liberal inspiration, it might be useful to refer to the works of a historian who was a partisan of the corporative system such as Emile Lousse (La societe d'Ancien Regime, organisation et representation corporatives [Louvain, 1943, 1952]). For a highly debatable attempt to upset the liberal interpretation by means of research in the modern content inherent in the organic conception of ancient France, see Roland Mousnier, "Comment les fransais du XVIIe siecle voyaient la constitution," Dix-septieme siecle 25 (1955): 9-36.</page><page sequence="5">S26 Valensise the body politic (an order conceived as even more fundamental than the laws since it was their natural source) to a modern, artificial idea of a constitution as founding the powers of a state-powers in principle revocable by the free will of the legislator, according to established procedures. To undertake the task of resolving this problem requires a double plan of action. First I shall attempt to clarify, with the aid of the def- initions given by dictionaries and encyclopedias, the linguistic possi- bilities and conceptual resources available to eighteenth-century minds as they thought of a constitution. Second, I shall try to elicit from the debate preceding the convocation of the Estates General, and the ca- hiers de doleances that prepared that convocation, what was at stake in the reconstruction and the conceptual deconstruction of the French constitution. I hope by this means to sketch an interpretation of the juridical fragility of the French monarchy and to clarify the causes of its dissolution. In this perspective, I will need to favor the abstract history of the concept of constitution over the discussion of its insti- tutional organization.7 THE USES OF CONSTITUTION: LINGUISTIC RESOURCES AND THE PROGRESS OF IDEAS IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY What was a constitution for the political culture of the ancien regime? How did the language of the eighteenth century construe the term "constitution"? What meanings, what phenomena were included in this term? As repositories of the linguistic usages of an epoch, the dictionaries present a complete system of lexical equivalents. They reveal the meaning of a word in the pure state of its use. After the end of the seventeenth century, "constitution" underwent a slow, almost imperceptible semantic transformation before it changed meaning radically through the doctrine of the law of nations. The use of the term occurs on various linguistic registers. In a general sense, "constitution" indicates the natural composition or the artificial dis- position of the parts of a whole. The word derives, in the first case, from an acceptation borrowed from natural philosophy and designated the primordial constitution of the universe, the make-up of the human body, or a person's temperament. In the second case, it derives from scientific usage of the vocabulary of creation. In this sense, it designates astronomy, astrology, or the art of poetry.8 Both acceptations lack any 7 See Elie Carcassonne, Montesquieu et le probleme de la constitution fran- Jcaise au XVIIIe siecle (Paris, 1927), a study that is still in many ways exemplary. 8 Pierre Richelet, Dictionnaire franJcois, contenant les mots et les choses,</page><page sequence="6">Constitution in Prerevolutionary Debate S27 explicit reference, when the word is used without a determining mod- ifier to the structure of the body politic or to the composition of a regime. The word did, however, have a particular sense in a juridical context, one that retained, at least until the middle of the eighteenth century, the original, classical meaning taken from Roman law, fixed by Justin- ian's Institutes, and later transferred to canon law. In this application it indicated the laws, regulations, ordinances, and statutes established by the superior will of the emperor or the pope, and it stood opposed to customary laws.9 A synonym here for the legislative power, in France the sense of the word "constitution" never included "the aberration of this original signification," as was the case in England, according to Burke.10 The definitions given by the dictionaries make no reference plusieurs nouvelles remarques sur la langue franfoise (Geneva, 1680), p. 172; (Amsterdam, 1706), p.216; 3 vols.

These definitions show clearly the inertia of lexical codes and the length of time it takes for languages to admit neologisms, for the se- mantic drift that was to astonish Burke lay at the heart of Montesquieu's reflections on the English constitution. This constitution guaranteed the political liberty of the citizen since it derived from the principle of the distribution of the legislative, executive, and judiciary powers, which permitted the citizen to live in tranquillity in the opinion that he had of his security.l1 Thus Montesquieu introduced into the mold of a still classic conception of constitution, conceived as the form of a political regime, a principle of classification unknown to classical an- tiquity.12 He created a new typology of the forms of government, in the process creating (in total unawareness, for one would search his work in vain for the idea of a need for a code of fixed laws to protect individuals from power) the conditions for arriving at a legal, ideal, and relative concept of constitution inspired by the new criterion of personal freedom.l3 1 l Charles-Henri de Secondat de Montesquieu, De l'esprit des lois, ed.

As is known, the same word designates one of the six forms of government, that of the mllltitude, the aim of which is the general interest (3.6.1279a), later defined as a mixture of two deviated forms, oligarchy and aristocracy (4.8.1293b).

The three successive editions of 1695, 1740, and 1762 reiterated the traditional synonyms of the term composition of the parts of a whole, order of a system-and retained the original meaning established by Roman and canon law.14 We have to wait for the Encyclopedie to find the term in its new juridical sense, but there is still no hint of the modern meaning. Al- though the term "constitution" still appears in the sense it had in the Digest, it also refers-and for the first time to the dispositions of French law.ls The constitution, a regulation established by a superior will, designated political laws. It referred to the edicts, ordinances, and royal declarations that placed the subjects of a ruler under an obligation of obedience, which meant that it was necessary for the sovereign courts to register and publish such edicts so that the laws would be certain and recognized. An analogous shift in the juridical use of the word, applied to the French monarchy, also appeared in the new edition of the Dictionnaire de Trevoux in 1771 the year of the Maupeou reform-where it served as a pretext for a direct comparison between Roman and French cus- toms. The dictionary first inventoried the different forms of constitution in canon law general regulations, particular regulations-then likened the term to the legislative will of the sovereign: "Constitution of the Prince is all that the King wishes to have force of law. This right to make the laws is the principal effect of sovereignty and its essential characteristic.''l6 Then, in order to distinguish public and private law tionen, Fundamentalgesetze, ed.

The general constitutions were thus the edicts, ordinancess and royal declarations, which were the concern of the public magistratures, the judges, and the sovereign courts. The particular constitutions designated the rescrits (edicts and royal proclamations), the lettres de jussion (directives to the sovereign courts), the lettres patentes (letters of patent confetTing rights or titles), and the arrets (decisions) of the Council of State concernlng individuals, companies, and communities in the kingdom that did not need to be published. The proof of official approval of this borrowing from canon law on the part of the French monarchic law lkes in the integral repetition of these distinctions at the end of the century in the great juridical summa of Guyot. 17 The real semantic transformation of the word does not appear until the reprinting of the Encyclopedie, rebaptized Dictionnaire universel et raisonne des connaissances humaines, published in Switzerland by Fortunato-Bartholomeo de Felice. In this work, the traditional dic- tionary meanings from Ronlan and canon law assimilated into French law were preceded by a long rubric that repeated an entire chapter of Vattel's Drost des gens. 18 The constitution of the state was now defined as "the fundamental regulation that determines the manner in which public authority is to be exercised. In it one sees the form under which the nation acts in its quality as a political body."'9 The constitution therefore expressed the deliberate choice of a nation which established the rules of its own political existence. In this new acceptation, how- ever, constitution and fundamental laws coexisted, but the latter were no Ionger constituting principles deducible from a given order, the customary norms born of the conditions of existence of a regime. Henceforth they were positive laws, established in a clear and precise manner, which combined to form the constitution of a state.20 As pre- 17 Pierre-Jean-Jacques-Guillaume Guyot, Repertoire universel et raisonne' de la jurisprudence civile, criminelle, canonique et benefitiale . . ., 64 vols.

Thus an ancient word defined something 1lew. The criterion of purely moral efEcacy in the limitati,or of the sovereign authority disappeared from these positive rules. The constitlltion, an unrepealable and fundamental norm, was the basis of the legislative authority of the nation, which had the recognized right to maintain or improve it by a majority vote. Nevertheless, this new concept retained an archaic element, for if the legislators held their power from the constitution, how could they modify it without destroy- ing the basis of that power? The absence of the idea of constituent power allowed them to go no further than abstract proclamation of the constitution as a fundamental rule established by the nation. Indeed, when the question of changing it came up, this led to a juridical impasse that could only be resolved by recourse to the notion of the tacit consent of the nation to the possible decision of its representatives to give themselves a new constitution. The section on "Economie Politique et Diplomatique" of the En- cyclopedie Methodiqlxe took up the new political acceptation of the word "constitution." Jean-Nicolas Demeunier, its author, reproduced word for word the same passage from Vattel that had been published in de Felice's Encyclopedie, referring as well to the example of Amer- ica. The clauses of the American state constitutions were unique in having been drawn up according to modern principles of the law of nations. Thus defined, they made the French constitution seem even more evanescent, for if one likened the traditional laws underlying the monarchy to the juridical regulation necessary to the organization of a state, it was only to point out that such laws were "vain phantoms."2' The absolute monarchy could, in fact, conform to them or find all manner of ways to violate them, if the king's interest lay in doing so. Fundamental laws, the precious patrimony of sovereignty, were not distinct from the state. Even though "remonstrances" on the part of the parlements were authorized, such laws were still not clearly dis- tinguished from sovereign power, which made their character as in- violable norms problematic. Furthermore, although the word was used are not only the ordinances by which the entire body of the nation determines what should be the form of government, and how one will succeed to the Crown; they are also the conventions between the people and the one or ones to whom it defers sovereignty that regulate the manner in which one must govern, and by which limits are placed on the sovereign authority.'' 21 Jean-Nicolas Demeunier et al., Encyclopedie methvdicBue: Econ(vmie po- liticBue et diplom(lticBue, 4 vols.

The definition was uni- versally admitted, acknowledged Demeunier (future deputy of the Third Estate of Paris and member of the Committee for the Constitution of 1789), but it was out of date the minute one referred to the powers invested in the three orders of the kingdom, which varied with circum- stances and were not subject to consistency or uniformity through time. Thus the idea of an evanescent constitution of the French monarchy slowly found its way into the general definitions of the eighteenth cen- tury. Examples of the sort that I have traced are limited in number compared to instances of traditional use of the word or adaptations of the sense of Roman and canon law to French law. But although the persistence of a frozen meaning shows the inertia of language, examples such as these also provide illustrations, in embryo, of a variety of political arguments founded in a new sense of the term. The debate on the convocation of the Estates General was to develop this line of argument, defying the historical persistence of a classic representation of the French monarchy. THE USES OF POLITICS: THE IDENTITY OF THE FRENCH CONSTITUTION ON THE EVE OF THE REVOLUTION By a decision of the King's Council on July 5, 1788, concerning the forms of convocation of the Estates General, the French monarchy called on the opinion of the kingdom to define its political constitution. This arret, addressed to the academies and the learned societies, or- dered studies of archives and ancient national monuments. It invited the rediscovery of a tradition fallen into disuse in order to establish proportion and harmony in the composition of the three orders of the kingdom within an assembly that would be "truly national."22 This directive thus officially imposed the extraordinary task of defining the French constitution. It was a task that had already intrigued learned historical circles for an entire century, had stirred public consciousness at moments of parlementary unrest, and had been at the center of political debate since the convocation of the Assembly of Notables in February 1787.23 22 Armand Brette, Recueil de documents relatifs a la convocation des Etats Ge'ne'raux de 1798, 4 vols .

Among these pamphlets I have selected for discussion the ones that seem to me to best represent the classic vision of the con- stitution, on the one hand, and a more modern definition rooted in the intellectual legacy of the Enlightenment, on the other.24 The pamphlets of the first group reelaborated the fundamental axioms of the theory of sovereignty from the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries in light of an unshakable conception of the monarchic constitution. This way of representing the constitution cast national history in the mode of enduring continuity. It thus neutralized the variations of that history for the sake of a theoretical reconstruction of a form of government based on the ancient Greek typology. The second group of pamphlets, which drew on eighteenth-century thought, revived the old themes of the discussion of the origins of the monarchy that had opposed Germanists and Romanists at the beginning of the century. They spoke of the early Frankish conquest as the matrix of the political rights of the nobility, of the assimilation of the con- querors by the conquered that legitimized the historic rights of the entire nation, or of the substitution of the idea of alliance for that of conquest to demonstrate the continuity of the Roman imperial tradition in French public customs.25 Thus they cast their imaginary reconstruc- tion of the French constitution in the mode of a return to a moment of origin. The constitution was not conceived, like the English monarchy, as the result of an immemorial and continuous tradition, the indisput- able legacy of time's secretion of customs and rights. In England con- crete and specific ancient feudal liberties had been transmuted into common and intangible guarantees. Common law, born of experience and carried along by accumulated usage, was the barrier to royal au- bles of 1787 and the 'Pre-Revolution' in France," French Historical Studies 3 (1984): 323-SS. 24 Quality was the criterion that inspired this choice. I analyze here a re- stricted number of these pamphlets (forty-nine in all), chosen for their origi- nality out of a corpus of 120 published between February 1787 and June 1789. I have deliberately excluded from this analysis the most famous pamphlet, Qu'est-ce que le Tiers Etat? which would merit a separate study, along with Sieyes's later thoughts on constitutional doctrine.

History had given rise to the protection of the individual from power, and the arrangement of the different part-s of the body- politic had resulted, after the Middle Ages, in an enviable balance of func- tions.26 It was the natural and spontaneous harmony among revstraints and counterweights to authority that defined English constitutional gov- ernment as seen from the Continent. In France, on the contrary, history had been barren. There vvere no usages legitimated by time or customary traditions that regulated the relations between kings and their subjects. Nor were there common norms, certain and always valid, inherited from the past. In France one found a tatal desert, whether one searched for a positive order of laws (of the kind that assured liberty to the English) in the empirical order of facts, in the customs of the people (from which the Greeks thought it emanated naturally), or in the sovereign's will. There were no fixed, definite, and immutable rules. Instead, there was the purest form of arbitrariness, and there was the sovereign's whim, as the lib- erals were to say later. Consequently, the constitution had to be defined indirectlyS by means of an ideal and almost hypothetical model, which: was found in the earliest moments of the monarchy. In this manner, the history of France lent itself to a deft treatment that shortened time spans, eliminated the significance of variation, and ascriWbed present legitimacy to a remote but authentic past. However, within this reference to an original constitution, the dual evocation of fidelity and degeneracy actually hid two quite distinct lines of argument. Those who lnterpreted the present constitution in terms of fidelity to the original constitution of the monarchy insisted on its continued ex- istence and founded their apology for it in the service of the status quo. Conversely, those who denounced deviations from that original con- stiAtution- questioned its continued existence and argued the need for its reestablishment. Furthermore, the first group recomposed the consti- tution with the aid of elements from classic political philosophy, whereas the second drew rather from modern philosophy. This led to an intel- lectual syncretism, a blending of historicism and the doctrine of natural 26 John&gt;G. A.

A CONSTITUTION TO DEFEND Apologetics for the French constitution were founded on a vision of the long persistence of the monarchy. Monarchy figured among the forms of government in the categories of classical antiquity. Like the immutable duration of the universe, the centuries-long existence of the French monarchy was incompatible with the idea that, in the absence of laws and principles, it might have been sustained by mere chance (Lb39.1655). These laws and these principles, which were substantial and regular even though neither written nor established (Lb39.1274), were considered inviolable because of their great age (Lb39.6346). Con- ceived as customary norms emanating from the conditions of life of a regime, as natural and inalterable laws analogous to those forming the constitution of a human being (Lb39.249),27 legitimized by tradition and respected from generation to generation such laws characterized the French monarchy and distinguished it from other forms of government. Not despotic, since there was not the government of one in the absence of laws and against the common weal; or aristocratic, for there was no order above the others; or democratic, for the great size of the territory would not tolerate it (Lb39.754), the French constitution classified according to the typology of classical thought on the basis of the number of rulers of a state and the goals of the regime was thus purely mon- archic and in conformity with the nature of France (Lb39.818). The French constitution was a perfect form of government, following Polybian theory, since it was exempt from all deviation, as its history proved, and from all cyclical reversals (Lb39. 1272). It scarcely had need of a founding charter of the rights of the sovereign and of the differerit orders composing it (Lb39. 1284). In the most radical forms of this apol- ogetics, the principles and the laws that inspired the French constitution were sufficient to regulate its organization. 27 This is the same conception found in Jean Bodin, Les Six Livres de la Republique (Paris, 1576-77). See bk. 4, chap. I ("De la naissance, acroisse- ment, estat fleurissant, decadence et ruine des Republiques"), pp. 401-4, and bk. 5, chap. I ("Du reglement qu'il faut tenir pour accomoder la forme de Republique a la diversite des hommes et le moyen de cognoistre le naturel des peuples''), pp. 516-18.

History figured as the axiomatic criterion that permitted theoretical construction of a model of constitution in the classical sense, rather than providing an empirical analysis of it. Thus, "constitution" was thought of as an absolute concept. It corresponded to the material reality of a form of government more than to a body of rules that determined its operation a priori. The elements of this reconstruction- fundamental laws and the idea of a unique, absolute, and indivisible sovereignty were considered outside their historic meaning. As the essential criteria for the reestablishment of royal power on the ruins of the feudal monarchy, these elements appeared to be the atemporal attributes of a form of government thought to be identical throughout the centuries.28 Thus, in this eclipse of time we can easily recognize, to repeat Isocrates' dictum, that what is constitution forms the state and belongs to it as a life principle that cannot be altered without annihilating the state itself (Lb39.911). What, then, were the principles and the laws of this constitution? First, the sovereign authority of the monarch: he was to have full, entire, and independent power (Lb39.581). Of divine origin, this au- thority made the king the supreme legislator of the kingdom, excluding, by means of a metaphysical representation of power, any legislative vocation on the part of the nation. As both law-giver and law-wielder, the king of France had no superior authority but God (Lb395 1462). The king's actions were inscribed in an ancient conception of justice con- sidered as the source of law, of which he was not merely the repository but also the interpreter (Lb39.853). Lex animata and holder of sover- eignty, the king of France was thus recognized, at the end of the eigh- teenth century, in his constitutive right to make laws, thanks to a mixture of classical and modern notions. He was superior to the existing laws, but he was held to respect the immutable laws of reason and the fun- damental laws of the kingdom (Lb39.1916).29 These fundamental laws 28 On the reestablishment of royal power on the ruins of the feudal monarchy, see Church (n. 9 above), pp. 43-74.

Jacques Le Brun [Geneva, 1967]). Although he acknowledged the inviolability of these laws, following biblical precedent (bk. I, prop. 8) and the conformity of the French constitution to divine will (bk. 2, prop. 11), Bossuet also admitted, following Thomas Aqui-</page><page sequence="16">Constitution in Prerevolutionary Debate S37 were exclusively moral limits to the exercise of power; they were natural rules born of the very history of the monarchy. Fixed and immutable, they were the only conventional limits to a power that, even though it lacked the right to suppress or modify them, could nonetheless violate them without encountering opposition or incurring sanctions. The king could never find any immanent guarantor external and superior to himself to assure that his dispositions conformed to the laws of the kingdom, though it might happen that he bequeath to the king who succeeded him acts to be abrogated posthumously. This was the only sanction in practice (though not in law) that the absolutist system imposed on violation of fundamental laws. The case of the legitimization of the natural children of Louis XIV and their elevation to the line of succession to the throne illustrates this in an exemplary manner.30 The rule governing the devolution of the Crown, transmitted hered- itarily by primogeniture solely to male representatives of the ruling branch, was considered to be among the fundamental laws, as were the inalienability of the royal demesne and the laws concerning royal coming of age and regencies. However, one could take this list of laws founded on a custom accepted by the king and by the Estates of the kingdom and demonstrate their amorphousness and flexibility in such phenomena as the king's exclusive legislative authority, the indivisi- bility of power that made the king the head of both the legislative and the executive authorities (thus ratifying his consubstantiality with the nation), and the right of the sovereign courts, the depositaries of these fundamental laws, to register and protest the royal edicts.31 nas, that kings are under the laws "not as regards the coactive power, but as regards derived power'' (bk. 4, prop. 4, p. 97), which means that they are not subject to the sanctions of the laws. 30 The dispositions of Louis XIV in favor of the Duc de Maine and the Comte de Toulouse were annulled by an edict of Louis XV in 1717 that acknowledged, among other things, the right of the nation to choose a new king in case of the extinction of the ruling branch. I hope one day to publish a satisfactory study (which is still lacking) of this episode. For a documentary update on the affair of the legitimization of Louis XIV's natural children, see Claire Saguez-Lovisi, Les lois fondamentales au XVIIIe siecle: Recherches sur la loi de de'volution de la Couronne (Paris, 1984). 31 The qualities of amorphousness and flexibility were present, what is more, in the list given by contemporary historians: see Joseph Declareuil, Histoire generale du droit fran,cais des origines a 1789 a l'usage des etudiants des faculte's de droit (Paris, 1925), pp. 389-99; Fransois-Jean-Marie Olivier-Martin, Les lois du Roi: Cours d'histoire du droit public (Paris, 1945-46), pp. 176 ff.; Roland Mousnier, Les institutions de la France sous la monarchie absolue,</page><page sequence="17">S38 Valensise At the end of the eighteenth century, the idea of an organic whole binding together the king and the orders of the kingdom, a figure of consubstantiality that had been essential to the concept of "regnum" in the Middle Ages, still found justification in the institution of the fideicommissum. According to this notion of succession in civil law, enjoyment of a property right was limited by the will of the predecessors and the expectations of the descendants. Applied to the royal succes- sion, the fideicommissum protected the rights of the nation, and it could easily be argued that "the rule that originally belonged to the nation" had been transmitted to the king, who received possession of it by heredity (Lb39.853). The law of the devolution of the Crown in this late and not overscrupulous evocation of a doctrine of public law con- structed on notions borrowed from civil law defined not only the king's rights but also those of the nation.32 It marked the definitive absorption of the nation's rights into the substance of kingship. It provided a hereditary title that, although it eluded men's wills, was nonetheless inscribed in the mystery of divine designs that accorded to the king the procreation of a successor. However, the Salic Law also had other implications for the nature of the regime. Those who wrote in defense of the French constitution found in it the support necessary to legitimate the nation's participation in the royal will under the traditional form of the king's convocation of an extraordinary con- sultative assembly (Lb39.559; Lb39.818; -Lb39. 1272). The constitution was thus represented as a consubstantial and perfect whole: the nation, in its universality, was the king and the three orders of the kingdomlergy, nobility, and Third Estate. (More innovative writers occasionally viewed the balance between these parts as the guarantee of national liberty [Lb39. 1005]). In the imaginary reconstruc- tion of the French constitution, the three orders of feudal society were conceived as abstract entities. As defenders, respectively, of the con- stitutingprinciples ofthe kingdom religion, property, and labor the three orders could never be merged, and this made the constitution simple and perfect (Lb39.1224). The three orders were untouched by 2 vols. (Paris, 1974-80), 1:502 (English ed., The Institutions of France under the Absolute Monarchy, 1598-1789, trans.

[Chicago, 1979]); Michel Antoine, Le Conseil du Roi sous le regne de Louis XV (Geneva and Paris, 1970), p. 140. 32 The best analysis of the problem of the evocation of a doctrine of public law constructed on notions borrowed from civil law is Ralph E. Giesey, "The Juristic Basis of Dynastic Right to the French Throne,"Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 51, no. 5 (1961).</page><page sequence="18">Constitution in Prerevolutionary Debate S39 any change or difference through time. One pamphlet, inspired by the imaginary uniformity imposed by absolutism, saw the three orders as unequal in rights, rank, and traditions but nonetheless equal as subjects of the same sovereign and in their obligation to serve the common weal. Moved by divergent interests, they converged at a common center, the king, whose impartiality assured mediation of those interests and guar- anteed the general interest (Lb39. 1277). An instituting criterion of tra- ditional society, inequality was also a principle indispensable to the existence of the monarchy. Gradations in rank kept men in the habit of respect for the majesty of the throne and conferred upon authority the moral force necessary to the government of a great state. Far from attaining the strategic subtlety of Necker's thoughts on the matter, inequality of condition in the pamphlets defending the French consti- tution served only to justify the maintenance of the traditional forms of convocation of the Estates (the separation of the orders and the vote by order) and to exclude any legislative function independent of the king.33 This was how those who asserted the existence of the French con- stitution defined its essence. Their apologetics for the constitution was cast in terms of a dogmatic certitude: the search for an ideal model found in the tripartite political schema of the ancients involved by- passing history. It also demonstrated that synthesis was possible be- tween differing notions and theories. But what was the monarchy's position regarding this reconstruction of its identity? Although it was traditionally above all attempt at def- inition, the monarchy not only called on opinion to define its consti- tution but also encouraged an official attempt to do so. Indeed, it found in Jacob-Nicolas Moreau the accredited interpreter of its tradition and the exegete of the true constitution. Author of antiphilosophe pamphlets and royal historiographerS charged since 1774 with safeguarding the national memory, Moreau devoted two volumes to an exposition of the history and dogmatic defense of the French constitution.34 His aim was to demonstrate that the Estates 33 Necker makes use of this idea for his critique of the errors of the Con- stituent Assembly. The gravest of these, in his view, was to have neglected the institution of a strong executive power after having undermined the symbolic basis of the kingship and its hold on imaginations by the principle of civil equality. For the former minister of Louis XVI, this was to ignore the very essence of monarchical French government (Necker [n. 6 abovely pt. 2, sec. 2,1:30-70). 34 Jacob-Nicolas Moreau, Exposition et defensse de notre constitution mo- narchEque fran,caise, 2 vols.

He argued that the English model was inapplicable to France and that throughout history the nation's liberty and the progress of the royal authority had complemented one another. A preface to the two parts of the work states his conviction that the constitution of a state was anterior to any edict, ordinance, or collection of laws. It corresponded to "a dogma, a tradition of doctrine, justified by a chain of events, which, infinitely differentiated, all resemble one another by a grand and useful hypothesis which either has never been contradicted or has always triumphed over contradiction."35 A modern method, the hypothetical and deductive construction of an intellectual object, is here put to the service of a traditional conception. History and ethics were to lend support to the enterprise. Moreau's thought thus belongs wholly within the classic conception of political constitution. For him, the concept of constitution was in- separable from the very existence of a given regime. It corresponded to the general conditions of political unity of a people. It consisted in the spontaneous development of the institutions and laws of a regime. It was neither a legal phenomenon, external to the regime, which es- tablished functions and created fundamental norms, nor a body of fixed rules needed to limit power and guarantee individual welfare. For Mo- reau, as for the later counterrevolutionaries, the constitution was the material source and the very condition of political and juridical rela- tions.36 It was not a law, but something anterior to any law and even more fundamental than the laws. It was the existence of a political community. to an order from the king to the historiographer of France sent through Lamoi- gnon, the Garde de Sceaux. See Jacob-Nicolas Moreau, Mes souvenirs, ed.

Richard A. Lebrun [Montreal, 1974], p. 112). &gt;</page><page sequence="20">Constitution in Prerevolutionary Debate S41 Thus from the origins of time the French constitution, in Moreau's view, was a pure monarchy consisting in the action of the will of one on that of all. He recognized indivisibility of powers in the person of the king. Seemingly attentive to the lesson of Montesquieu, however, he introduced the idea of division of power at the administrative level, as the same king entrusted power to the agents of his sovereignty through offices or in the form of special commissions. This adminis- trative distinction was inspired by the Romanist theses of the Abbe Dubos on the continuity of imperial juridical usages in ancient Gaul and then among the Franks.37 It legitimized a view of power as absolute, but it also accredited the tradition of a popular, municipal, and general administration carried out by the three orders of the kingdom. Thus Moreau anchored mediation between the king and the nation in the idea of administration. The depositaries of the royal will were the defenders of the people and the representatives for the nation not of the nation in the legislative councils formed around the sovereign. The nation was subjected to them, composed as it was, singulatim et divisim, of corporations, communities, special-interest associations, and individuals. The nation never figured in Moreau's thinking as an organized general body.38 General assemblies did not represent the true mainspring of the French constitution. The few examples of general assemblies that history offered showed, moreover, that they were not only an episodic but also an inefficacious form of extraordinary con- vocation for the instruction and the advice of the sovereign. Moreau cast his reconstruction of the various historic events to il- lustrate the persistence of this original model throughout the centuries. To give one example, although he considered the changes that feudal anarchy and the reaction of the Capetian kings brought to this model, he did so in order to attribute such changes to the illegitimate extension of administrative authority exercised in the name of the king by the depositaries of his will and to show the recomposition of the primitive constitution by a reinforced royal power after the dissolution of feu- dalism. The idea of administration thus marks the reestablishment of the liberties of the nation in the face of feudal oppression, allowing Moreau to identify in the king the guarantor of these recovered liberties. It also served as a historical alternative needed to refute the democratic interpretation of the history of France offered by Mably and all those 37 See Alfred Lombard, L'Abbe du Bos, un initiateur de la pensee moderne (1670-1742) (Paris, 1913); Carcassonne (n. 7 above), pp. 42 ff.; Thomas E. Kaiser, ''The Abbe Dubos, the Constitution, and the Defense of Monarchy in Early Eighteenth-Century France" (typescript). 38 Moreau, Exposition et defense, 2:105.</page><page sequence="21">S42 Valensis;e who saw the legitimacy of the legislative authority of the nation as deriving from Germanic liberties and from the Frankish assemblies of the Champ de mars rand the Champ de mai in Charlemagne's reign. Refutation by history, although a necessary condition for the rees- tablishment of the true French constitution, was not a sufficient con- dition for it. Moreau offered the latter in the dogmatic section of his work in a theoretical refutation of the idea that the nation united in general assembly had the right to give itself a new constitution. To this purpose, he utilized t-he old Aristotelian dogma that societies are found tin nature, but he fitted it into the Thomistic mold of theological deter- minism. This permitted him to deny that the idea of cont-ract underlay all political obligation and allowed him to demonstrate that the material political constitution was prior to human conventions and was in in- trinsic conformity to an order willed by God. In zdoing so, Moreau anticipated Maistre's refutation of the artificiality of written revolu- tionary constitutions and his tendency to -found on the axiom of the divine and inscrutable origin of all political constitutions their ante- riority to the futile wills of legislators. But at the same time, the did not renounce the attempt to sketch a natural etiology of constitutions, thus freeing them from the providentialist mystery inv-oked by Maistrwe.39 For Moreau, the rights and the duties of men were founded on re- lati-ons independent of any contract. The famil-y, the natural association par excellence, was manifest proof of this. In the patriarchal repre- sentation of authority adopted by Moreau, the family figured as the model for the monarchy, the most natural political form. Not only was the ffamily the first matrix of monarchies in history, as the Holy Scrip- tures attested, but above all it represented a synthesis of the deter- minism essential to any form of association. Men were born subjects of a state just as they were born children in a family. Their obligations were determined by the ends-for which they were born, by the position they occupied on the earth, by the moment of the passing centuries in which they lived-40 In such an anthropology, conceived on the model of the most con- crete historic and social determinism, there was obviously no place for the abstraction of natural equality.

Porter [Chicago, 1959]). 40 Moreau, Exposition et defense, 2:206-7, 222.</page><page sequence="22">Constitution in Prerevolutionary Debate S43 man beings, who spontaneously worked together for the common fe- licity according to divine design, removed free will the second abstraction necessary to the modern view of the individual from the origin of societies. Furthermore, when Moreau invalidated the very existence of a state of nature by citing examples from universal history, he undermined the ultimate ruling idea, the hypothetical condition con- ceived by Hobbes and Rousseau that permitted the founding of social order on reason. In this way, he shattered all possibility of construing the political constitution as a result of a contract based on voluntary agreement between free and equal individuals. He thereby neutralized the modern doctrine of natural law and discredited the intellectual preconditions for a new pact for the founding of public life in France which would have authorized the nation to advance beyond the existing constitution and create a new one. Moreau clung to the idea of the indivisible consubstantiality of nation and monarchy as integral, in- separable parts of the same whole. The nation, for Moreau, corresponded to an empirical, material, and factual entity. For him, the word designated all the corporations, fam- ilies, associations, and individuals composing the body social. Tied to the Crown by the ancient criterion of the identity of the kingdom that justified the obedience of subjects in exchange for the protection of the ruler, the nation, for Moreau, was made up of subjects, not citizens; it resulted from ownership, not from a contract. Antonym of a nation of citizens, it was the indissoluble synonym of kingship, with which it figured as the very representation of the French constitution. This was a further, tautological proof of the assertion with which Moreau had begun, that the need to convoke the Estates did not originate in the constitution. The logical conclusion of this deductive and dogmatic reconstruction of the true constitution was thus an unswerving loyalty to the past: absolute respect for the traditional forms of convocation of the three orders of society, meeting and deliberating separately, assembled for the sole purpose of offering their advice to the king. Such was the interpretation of the constitution found in the pamphlets written in its defense. With rare exceptions, it corresponded to the views expressed in the cahiers de doleances of the clergy and the nobility.41 In fact, the two first Estates posed as champions of a tra- 41 I have taken the wishes of these two orders concerning the constitution from the Resume general, ou Extrait des Cahiers de pouvoirs, Instructions, Demandes et Doleances remis par les divers Bailliages, Senechaussees et pays d'Etats du Royaume d leurs deputes, d l'Assemblee des Etats-Ge'neraux ouvert d Versailles le 4 mai 1789, par une socie'te de Gens de Lettres, 3 vols.

They recognized monarchical government as the unshakable constitution of the nation. They offered irrefutable proofs of its existence the long history of the state, the division by orders, and the great number of usages that, although un- ratified, had always been recognized-against the "outrageous" con- trary thesis defended by the Third Estate. But if they argued against the introduction of any innovations in the constitution, the clergy and nobility nevertheless admitted in their cahiers that the national assem- blies were an essential part of the constitution that they were defending. They demanded regular, periodic meetings of the Estates General, in their traditional form. The nobility based this demand on history, found in the ordinances of the fourteenth century. They also derived it from a vague sensitivity to Enlightenment attitudes, as in their use of notions of general will and of contract to acknowledge the power of the Estates General to consent to taxes and make new laws (though not to abrogate those on which monarchical government was founded). Thus, within the classic notion of constitution, there also appear the notions of separation of powers and of the sharing of legislative authority between the king and the Estates. It must be added that although these cahiers asserted the existence of fixed and immutable laws, they also insisted on the compelling need for a new assembly to recognize them, conserve them, and make them public in the form of a code or a charter. Thus when they demanded that the rights of the nation be established on a solid base and that the rights pertaining to all mankind be explicitly declared, it was the re- establishment of the old constitution and the uprooting of abuses that they envisaged. One can find in these cahiers the same ambiguous conception of the French constitution, part history, part abstract law, as among the deputies of the Estates General. The attitudes of the first two orders of the kingdom simply reveal another expression of the ambiguity and the juridical confusion typical of the period. They were faithful to traditional monarchical institutions for example, the parle- ments, to whose traditional funci;ion as depositaries of the laws was added the new function of guardians of the constitution, which, as custom dictated, remained subject to registration by them. But these first two orders of the realm were also ready to banish, as contrary to a good constitution, all privileges and exemptions contrary to the equal- ity of taxation that they expected from the new assembly. Similarly, they were determined to eliminate the practice of lettres de cachet, which the nobility held to be illegal because contrary to liberty of the individual, and the practice of slavery, the abolition of which the clergy</page><page sequence="24">Constitution in Prerevolutionary Debate S45 demanded in the name of the liberty of humankind even though it continued to defend honorific distinctions among the social orders and noble privileges. A CONSTITUTION TO ESTABLISH How did those who contested the existence of the French constitution define constitution? They saw it as a code of fixed laws (Lb39. 1644); as a convention; as a founding contract (Lb39.739); as an order of laws in conformity with the nature of a particular society. But they also saw it as a composition of the realm that was to be reestablished (Lb39. 1271 ) . The imaginary decomposition of the French constitution rested on an intellectual syncretism much stronger than that of apologetics for that constitution. It presented a mixture of abstraction and organicism; it was an appeal to history and to the metaphysics of the individual (Lb39.6663; Lb39.992). The idea of a constitution that had degenerated from its primitive form could be based on the idea of natural rights originally consecrated by the election of the royal race (Lb39.715; Lb39.741). Thus a modern topos the idea of a contract founding so- ciety and power was confused with a notion that had come out of sixteenth-century Protestant contestation: the pact of submission on the part of a people for whom power was ontologically prior to its union. Clearly, many instances of this imaginary disassembly of the con- stitution distinguished only hazily between a natural political order and an artificial one. Thus, for example, the biological metaphor of the human body was used to define the constitution of the body politic, considered perfect when all its parts were tightly interconnected, healthy, and solid. Yet although the anthropomorphic figure of the body politic had been forged from elements borrowed from medieval Catholic the- ology to legitimate the corporative representation of the kingdom of France, it could also be used to undermine that representation.42 For the parts of the body politic were now individuals who henceforth composed the nation (Lb39.769). The national body politic would there- fore be one whose different parts worked together for the well-being of individuals and for the conservation of the whole. This was possible only if all its members could gather to deliberate on the common weal. Those who held such views demanded the regular expression of this 42 On the elements borrowed from medieval Catholic theology, see Ernst H. Kantorowicz, The King's Two Bodies: A Study in Mediaeval Political Theology (Princeton, N.J., 1957).</page><page sequence="25">S46 Valensise right inherent in the condition of free men, which compromised the constitution in the older sense of the composition of the orders (Lb39. 1294). Unlike the human body, however, the political constitution was no longer made up of physical, animated entities. To the contrary, it cor- responded to laws, institutions, and the functional procedures of pow- ers (Lb39. 1161). Bergasse was to say that it was "legislative movement" that constituted the life of the body politic, just as the movement of the diaphragm supported the life of the human body. Thus the anthro- pomorphic representation of the body politic, formerly seen as a har- monious whole in which various members participated naturally and in obedience to a hierarchical distribution of functions, lost its tradi- tional and organicist substance. This representation was retained, how- ever, even in the introduction of a deliberately artificialist and voluntarist notion of the laws necessary to its recomposition (Lb39.739). The ideal model of this perfect constitution was not to be sought in abstract law, but in history (Lb39.1220). It coincided with the mythic original con- stitution of the realm, found in the general and national assemblies, periodically brought together under the reign of Charlemagne and charged with conceding subsidies and approving the laws, which arose out of the primitive separation of executive and legislative powers (Lb39.1285; Lb39.1295; Lb39.832). The division of powers, a discovery necessary to modern notions of liberty, was introduced through another variant of the biological met- aphor in which a head watches over the conservation of the members, while a common nerve center elaborates the "spirits" that bring life to all parts of the body (Lb39.769). This dichotomy reflected the dis- tinction between nation and monarchy within the traditional view: the idea of a relation between the two replaced the idea of their union. Above all, however, the image served to elaborate Montesquieu's no- tion of the division of powers in the Rousseauistic terms of the indi- visibility of sovereignty.43 It was the nation that created the "head" of the body politic. Unique source of power and general synthesis of individual wills and interests, it preceded the king, who owed it his existence. Those who contested the French constitution thus thought of the nation in terms that were the mirror image of monarchy as represented by its champions. The two shared identical attributes: uni- versality, unanimity, and responsibility for the common weal (Lb39. 1296). 43 Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Du contrat social, ed. Jean Ehrard (Paris, 1975), bk. 2, chap. 2 ("Que la souveraineteest indivisible"), p. 251; bk. 3, chap. 1 ("Du gouvernement en general), pp. 272-73.</page><page sequence="26">Constitution in Prerevolutionary Debate S47 But the attributes of the nation derived from postulates strictly antithetical to those of monarchy: equality and liberty of the individ- uals who made up the nation, and rational choice of a general con- vention at the origin of its power founding the obligation to respect that power (Lb39.1271). If the idea of an indivisible consubstantiality of nation and kingship persisted in writings critical of the constitution, and if they continued to acknowledge, following a llenaissance adage, that "in France the king does not die, for the nation [henceforth substituted for the realm] would seem to die with him" (Lb39.739), it was in an individualistic key and in criticism of the corporative system. The time-honored unity of nation and king in the monarchical constitution no longer referred to the realm to be protected from external enemies, but to the nation to be defended against usurpation and injustice within the state (Lb39.635). The idea of the nation as an abstract, generalized collectivity thus became an intellectual instrument for criticism of the intermediary bodies that intercepted communication between the various parts of the body politic, obstructing, by their special privileges, the realization of the common weal (Lb39.7085) and thus serving as the instruments of despotism (Lb39.769). This same idea of the nation as representing general interests also sustained a diagnosis that reform was dictated by the labyrinthine complexity of legislation and administration, ex- ercised under many forms by heterogeneous and divergent powers and subjected to various juridical regimes (Lb39.728). This meant criticism of the parlements: bridles on power according to the Esprit des Zois; but dangerous in their ambition to represent the nation when seen according to the Contrczt social (since they were composed of office- holders named by the king, owing their posts to their wealth, and acting both as judges and involved parties where administration of the law was concerned). It also meant criticism of the variety of regimes that existed in a land where some regions were under customary law and others were subject to written Roman law (Lb39.1293) and of the as- sertion of the king's legislative power to validate customs through official redaction, thus absorbing into the sovereign legislative will phe- nomena that were the spontaneous creation of material legal princi- ples.44 These situations only further confused the national juridical tradition in France and made the uniformity of norms in the country even more evanescent. The monarchy's long history, proof of its immutable perfection in the eyes of those who championed the French constitution, was sub- 44 Church (n. 9 above)? pp. 100-120; Pocock (n. 26 above), pp. 45 ff.</page><page sequence="27">S48 Valensise jected by the latter's detractors to the application of an empirical and inductive method revealing its inconsistencies and its fragility. Broken down into a myriad of shifting circumstances and episodes (Lb39.672), it revealed an inconstancy and an absence of customs, usages, tradi- tions, and habits that later inspired the resigned analysis of the tradi- tional constitution offered by Madame de Stael and the liberals.45 In the classic sense of the mode of existence of a regime, the French constitution referred then to various forms of government (Lb39.6649) that retained a simple uniformity of principle (Lb39.788). In one mech- anistic version, the metaphoric distinction between the mainspring that set the machine in motion and the fixed combination of its gears illus- trated the hiatus between the monarchical principle and the historical constitution (Lb39.360). The term "monarchy" thus covered a form of government that was mixed at its origin, then feudal, then absolute. Following Mably's model, French history was seen as a cycle of lib- erty and usurpation from the ancient Carolingian constitution, which had been founded on the political participation of the nation, to the des- ecration of public liberties under the barons, a history redeemed by the alliance between commons and kingship under the reign of Philippe the Fair. With its unstable juridical tradition, it was a mine of constant mu- tations, useful not only to demonstrate the flexibility of the constitution but also to legitimize new modifications. If one could accept that it was royal authority that had introduced the separation between the orders at the time of the Estates of 1376, nothing prevented one from main- taining, as Condorcet was to do (Lb39.800; Lb39.1299), that the same authority had the right to establish new assemblies founded on the union of the three orders deliberating together. An inexhaustible reservoir of examples and of conflicting legitimi- zations, history offered all the justification needed to demand the reform of the national constitution. Whether this latter was understood as the composition of the body politic or the fundamental rule of monarchical government, history and in the present case, the law testified to its transiency. As soon as one reflected on its instability through time, the division of the realm into three separate social orders became a de- batable criterion for national representation or the separation of pow- ers. "What were the privileges of the clergy who at some times called themselves independent from the king [and] at others independent from the Pope?" Madame de Stael was to ask. "What were the powers of the- nobles, who at times thought themselves authorized to demand their rights, arms in hand, and at other times recognized the king as 45 See above, n. 6.</page><page sequence="28">Constitution in Prerevolutionary Debate S49 absolute monarch? What could be the existence of the Third Estate, emancipated by the kings, and yet condemned to a perpetual minority, since it was only accorded one voice out of three, and its grievances had no positive force?"46 The balance sheet seemed just as doubtful looked at from the power side and considering the alteration of these ancient feudal divisions by the absolute monarchy. Absolute monarchy had favored the hereditary nobility while at the same time selling noble privileges to commoners, thus contributing to the collapse of the feudal order. The medieval order of society, deriving from divine assignment of men's place on this earth, underwent a parallel process of real erosion and symbolic refashioning. There was real erosion, for the basis for the nobility of the blood had disappeared, wiped out when men whom the land for- merly gave to the lord gained ascendancy over the government, and replaced by an artificial nobility created by decree. There was symbolic refashioning, for in exchange for the equalizing effects of centralization, the monarchy also recreated a universe apart in the system of the royal court, at once the elaborate consecration of hierarchies of rank and social inequalities and the ultimate ratification of the progressive exile of these principles from the heart of real society. Those who defended the constitution in order to affirm the separation of social orders thus invoked an outmoded principle corroded by the monarchy itself. By abolishing all political space between power and individuals, by abandoning the convocation of the Estates, by turning to the parlements to decree taxes, by suppressing all legislative expres- sion and any form of local government, absolutism necessarily favored the imaginary creation of a society of subjects equal in their duties of submission and obedience to the sovereign power. This society was destined to become the indispensable prerequisite to a simple, uniform system of representation in conformity with reason, which the idea of the universality and generality of the nation translated into the language of the Revolution. Traces of this profound idea, which Tocqueville deployed against Burke's analysis of the traditional constitution in French history, can be glimpsed in the debate that preceded the Estates of 1789.47 If in certain of these pamphlets we can document the source 46 Madame de Stael (n. 6 above), pt. I, chap. 11, 1:130. This retrospective interrogation continues throughout this chapter and ends up in a summary that is both exasperated and modest on the adequacy of Salic law as a basis for a constitution. 47 Tocqueville (n. 2 above), "Etat social et politique de la France avant et depuis 1789," 1 :153, and also bk. 2, chap. 6 ("Des moeurs administratives sous l'ancien regime''), 1:135; bk. 3, chap.

Thus, according to Rousseau's model, these forms no longer corresponded to real pro- portions in the French population (Lb39.676). No longer an adequate expression of the very different composition of the kingdom, they were equally unable to represent its new interests, in imitation of the English model (Lb39.758). In either case, this implied the vote by head and the doubling of the Third Estate (Lb39.707). Finally, if the constitution as the legal rule of monarchical govern- ment corresponded to no more than the Salic Law, that too was in- adequate. The norm concerning the devolution of the Crown concerned only the king and the people to the extent of its attachment to the ruler (Lb39.675). In the critical view of the French constitution, it did not fix the laws that should hold between the king and the people, or among the members of the body politic. It was a fundamental law of the kingdom, but it was not a constitutive law of the nation, for in order to be so it would have to be voted on and adopted by the nation that was to conform to it (Lb39.1203). The supreme legislative authority of the sovereign, the pillar of the existing constitution, was thus radically contested. The sole and ab- solute legislator that singular metaphysical being who had for cen- turies represented the unity of a people on a territory lost consistency as soon as one discovered that there was no law to oblige him to respect the fundamental laws and demanded a will external to his as a guarantee of this obligation (Lb39.7085). The fundamental terms of French kingshithe king and the law- were thus separated in the name of a will different from the king's and of the legal obligation to respect the fundamental laws, henceforth to be seen as emanating froma certain and positive norm set by a nation legislating for itself.

Tocqueville's dialogue with Burke, whom he had read, pen in hand ("Fragments et notes inedits sur la Revolution,'' 2:338-42) seems ever- present in his thinking in L'Ancien Regime et la Re'volution, from the initial reference to the "great mind illuminated by hatred" of the Revolution that opens the first book (chap. 1, 1:80-81), to the comparison between France and England that refutes the analogies advanced by Burke.

The most deep-seated fault in the French constitution thus produced its metamorphosis and brought forth the principle of the new legal constitution. The conceptual dismemberment of the French con- stitution prompted a profound transformation of fundamental laws and developed the seeds of the dissolution of the traditional monarchy, since a king subjected to laws would no longer be the king that he once had been. This idea of a nonexistent constitution, or of a constitution inade- quate to regulate the rights of the nation, can of course be seen through- out the cahiers of the Third Estate, for whom the correction of abuses and the regeneration of the state required nothing less than a new constitution.48 This latter, the creation of which was viewed by the Third Estate as the fundamental task of the new assembly and the old sovereign, was to be a code of the principles and essential rules of monarchical government, specifying the rights of the ruler and those of the nation and prescribing the respective limits of the various powers. Any modification of this general charter was to be reserved to the "constitutive power" of the nation which, by an act of the entire body of its citizens, was to name representatives solely and explicitly for this purpose. Read annually in places of worship and in public places, the new constitution of France was to bind not only the people, but also the king, for each new sovereign would be required at his coro- nation to solemnly swear to observe the constitutional laws of the nation. In this ingenuous attempt at juridical recombination, it is hardly surprising to find among those laws liberty and the natural equality of men A prerequisites for the accession of members of the Third Estate to high public office. Yet this bold mixture of notions that history was to decree incompatible also contained some clear ideas. The separation of powers, one of the essential principles of the new constitution de- manded by the Third Estate, accorded executive power to the king and legislative power to the nation which meant, for the cahiers of the Third Estate (unlike those of the nobility), that this latter was to be exercised by the Estates General. This new principle in the organization of public life may have had an innovative result in a head vote in all three Estates, which the cahiers of the Third Estate advocated as preventing unwise decisions more effectively than the creation of a high chamber. Still, it continued to be influenced by the past in its 48 Resume general ou extrait des Cahiers, Tiers Etat, sec. 2, 3:41-78.</page><page sequence="31">S52 Valensise concern for increased efficiency in the execution of the laws, which were still to be submitted to the parlements for ratification. The cahiers of the Third Estate thus show the same ambiguity as those of the other Estates an ambiguity that seems all the more pro- nounced for being tied to a demand for guarantees of the liberty and property of the new citizen. CONCLUSION Inexhaustible in its historical interest, the public discussion preceding the Estates General in 1789 provides an ideal point from which to understand the evolution of the concept of constitution and the crys- tallization of the classic conception of the French monarchy in its last attempt at definition. The contradictions of the argument that a con- stitution exists and must be defended demonstrate no less than the logic of the opposing argument that a constitution does not exist and must be established an uncertainty and lack of unanimity in the search to identify the nature of the French constitution. The opposing views reveal both the fragility of the traditional view of the constitution and the underlying reason for its evolution. These contrasting interpretations were made possible by recourse to two different concepts of constitution, both of which continued to contribute to political reflection in succeeding intellectual traditions. Like the liberals at a later date, the detractors of the French constitution envisioned the constitution as an abstract legal concept. They sought immutable principles of the monarchy, which they failed to find in a charter that had survived the ravages of time, in a code, uniform usages, or any historical regularity in the functioning of the various components of the monarchical state. The champions of the constitution, on the other hand, chose (as the counterrevolutionaries were to do) an ab- solute, material, and concrete concept of constitution. As good Aris- totelians, they continued to believe that the nature of a regime was defined by its principle (whereas their opponents held, as Montesquieu had taught, that this principle derived from the nature or from the structure of society). Consequently, the champions of the constitution could (somewhat unsystematically) infer constitutional laws from the very existence of monarchical government, for which they proposed a simple, abstract taxonomy of powers following the classical model. The detractors of the constitution, conversely, stumbled over the fact of excessive power and detailed without conviction the confused laws that were presumed to limit it. Thus, the only possible constitution coincided with traditional divine right monarchy: heredity of the Crown;</page><page sequence="32">Constitution in Prerevolutionary Debate S53 inequality of conditions; the existence of three social orders in the kingdom; vote by order; and perhaps also the nation's consent to taxes; and justice administered by irremovable magistrates in accordance with fundamental laws. These were axiomatic but nevertheless uncertain norms, even if (as Joseph de Maistre was later to reiterate) they were written in the hearts of the subjects.49 We can see here the seeds of the judgments of liberal and counter- revolutionary historiography regarding the traditional monarchy. If for some the monarchy corresponded to a de facto but not a de jure political order, since it lacked a constitution, for others it was, to the contrary, a political order in which law coincided with fact, since laws were merely the natural emanation of a real order. Defining as they do the two extremes in the evolution of a concept, these two views of the French constitution are obviously based on incompatible intellectual premises. Given tragic new meaning by the Revolution, they became the source for two mutually exclusive lines of argumentation that were to make the traditional monarchy the antithesis of the legal state, and the legal state a contingent and fragile creation subject to the revers- ibility of human decisions, without foundation in or continuity with traditional France. For anyone who examines them in the original and innocent for- mulations-innocent because without apparent consequences they received during this learned exercise in the definition of the French constitution, these two views seem nonetheless to define an essential problem in the modern doctrine of the constitution: the relation between the material constitution and the ideal constitution of a political com- munity. In the void created between these opposing interpretations, the prerevolutionary pamphlets and the cahiers de doleances hint that the resolution of this problem would depend on factual and extrajurid- ical conditions existing prior to the reorganization of a state which implies a purely political foundation for law.S° In this sense, it is clear how far these texts of the ancien regime anticipated the dramatic changes 49 Maistre, Essai sur le principe generateur: "Certain people have thought to perpetuate an excellent witticism at the expense of Frenchmen by asking, 'In what book was Salic law written?' But Jerome Bignon [author of La Gran- deur de nos roys et de leur souveraine puissance (Paris, 1615)] answered quite appropriately, very likely without knowing how right he was, 'that it is written in the hearts of Frenchmen' " (p. 2). 50 For a still unsurpassed treatment of this problem, see Carl Schmitt, Ver- fassungslehre (Berlin, 1928); and Raymond Carre de Malberg, Contribution a la theorie generale de l'Etat specialement d'apres les donnees fournies par le droit constitutionnel fran Jcais, 2 vols . (Paris, 1920-22) .</page><page sequence="33">S54 VMlensise that law and legality were to unde-rgo during the Revolution. But that is another story. Reversing this teleological temptation, I might note that this body of texts demonstrates the role that the French monarchy played in the dissolution of the classic idea of constitution. In many respects, the monarchy itself set in motion the shift from an absolute to a relative concept of constitution by modifying the eomposition of the parts of the kingdom through voluntarist and artificialist measures. It not only weakened the very sllbstance of the ancient feudal constitution of the three orders of the realm but also set off a process of subverting history and effacing tradition, thus creating the conditions for a repudiation of the pre-legal, material, and absolute idea of political constitution (in the classical sense) on the grounds that it was inapplicable to the true state of prerevolutionary society. The involuntary heritage of this dismantling of the past made France the privileged historical terrain for the transition to a new idea of con- stitution. Monarchical power had worked in such a way as to offer its detractors an entire body of ideas and doctrines. It bequeathed them principles and criteria of identity with which to create a new sovereignty that was to prove fatal to it.5l This process of creation involved both imitation and inversion: imitation, because these unconscious heirs of the monarchy traced an exact copy of its sovereignty; inversion, be- cause this same copy gave them the power, at least conceptually, to overthrow the old monarchical constitution.
