<plain_text><page sequence="1">DANCE IN NIGERIA Peggy Harper igeria is a composite of a large number of traditional cultures. The fact that there are over one hundred different spoken languages gives some indication of the cultural diversity of the country. The majority of these cul- tures are in a state of transition between the traditions of their ancestors and the educational and technological demands of modern life. Dance in Nigeria today functions in three worlds which may be clearly differentiated for study purposes but do in fact merge: the traditional world, the neo-traditional world, and the contemporary world. The present paper is a discussion of the main overt functions, the form, and the recording and analysis of traditional Nigerian dance. It is based on my own observations of the role played by dance in traditional societies in Ni- geria. I have made no attempt to treat the implicit motivations underlying dance situations. FUNCTIONS OF DANCE Traditional dance is an essential element of all aspects of life in a homo- geneous society, and the first step in studying dance in traditional society is to identify the functions it performs. A dance usually has a principal overt function and a number of related subsidiary functions which may be a con- scious expression or an implicit reflection of the structure of the society and its way of life. In Nigerian traditional societies dance is the vortex of religious ritual and ceremony: a priest or priestess is the leading dancer, using dance and symbolic gestures to lead initiates in dances designed to appease the supernatural pow- ers, solicit divine protection, or give thanks to the guardian spirits of the com- munity. In all societies dance is an expression of social organization in that it differentiates and defines the roles of individuals, the sexes, and groups within the society. Social units, such as age groups, express their identity and cohe- sion in dances which are seen on occasions of social significance and celebra- tion. In some communities there are specific dances for marriage, funerals, and similar occasions. The attributes proper to the performers, and attitudes suita- ble to the occasions, are expressed in these dances. The chiefs and elders of the society state their authority, and their subjects offer loyalty and homage 280</page><page sequence="2">HARPER: DANCE IN NIGERIA in terms of dance. Such dances serve a political purpose and stress leadership and internal order within the society. Dance also expresses the economic life of the community. For example, manual work is facilitated by the rhythmic execution of actual working move- ments performed by a team of workers engaged in communal forest clearing or road building. In practically all traditional societies members of professional organizations-hunters', farmers', and fishermen's guilds-perform specific dances which express the local economy and often include mimetic re-enact- ments of occupational movements. These dances are used to celebrate seasonal festivals related to the occupational cycle of the community. In traditional societies, particularly among the Ibo people, dance is ex- tensively used as an educational technique. Repetitive dance patterns serve to educate children and introduce new members to traditional patterns of behav- iour and standards of conduct. The most significant use of dance in educa- tional terms is in the ceremonial and social dances which are designed to in- troduce adolescents into adult society and to stress the significance of fertility and the conduct considered proper between sexes for that society. Dance is also used to keep young men physically fit, to teach them the control and discipline necessary in warfare, and to inculcate feelings of patriotism. Forms of traditional theater are an important part of life in many tradi- tional societies. Some communities express historical and mythological tradi- tions in theatrical productions integrating music, dance, song poetry, and cos- tume in what is best described as "whole theater" in that the various arts come together in a balanced whole. In many societies audiences are enter- tained by virtuoso dance performances or satires on daily life of which dance is a central element. Less formally organized dance is one of the chief sources of recreation in all societies among all age groups. FORM IN DANCE Important considerations in the discussion of dance are form and the rela- tionship between function and form. Within a single culture the study of the movement patterns in daily life shows clearly that they exist as a basis from which the formal patterns of dance emerge. The form of the dance is suited to its func- tion and rooted in the movement habits of the community. Hence a comparative interpretation of the relationship between form and function in the dances of a particular society is feasible. But movement and gesture vary greatly from people to people and depend on the way in which the particular people cope with their geographical, climatic, and historical circumstances in terms of ultitarian, social, and ritual movement. Although functionally alike, they are realized in radically different forms in different cultures. In considering form in dance the emphasis is on the artistic and 281</page><page sequence="3">HARPER: DANCE IN NIGERIA expressive aspects of the movement of human bodies in space and time. The analysis of dance movements entails breaking them down into their com- ponent elements of space, time, and energy. The use of space is recognized in terms of the design of the dancers' movement on the ground or through the air. The element of time is expressed in the duration of the dance, the tempo or relative speed at which the movements are performed, and the metric and rhythmic patterns which bind the movement to the accompanying music. These movements are performed with a characteristic use of energy or muscu- lar effort which gives the dynamic quality to the movement. It is the specific use of these formal elements which reflects the way of living of a particular people. DANCE AMONG THE YORUBA A study of the dancing of the Yoruba people of Western Nigeria reveals that much of the formalized dance is performed as an integral part of religious ceremony. The dances of priests or chief celebrants are usually distinct from the dances of the initiates. Traditional Yoruba life revolves around the worship of a pantheon of deities or Orisa, conceived as the offspring of the supreme sky god Olorun Olodumare who is worshipped through the Orisa. Many Orisa lived as mortal men of heroic qualities prior to their deification, and some are worshipped throughout Yorubaland while others belong to a specific town or area. They control the forces of nature and may have specialized roles, as with Ogun, the god of Iron and protector of all who use metal, from warriors to lorry drivers. The counterpart of Olodumare is the Earth Mother, the goddess Onile, who in some areas is known as Odua; in other areas Yemoja, goddess of the sea, plays an equivalent role. The great mother, unlike Olodumare, may be approached directly through prayer, sacrifice and offerings, and the ritual societies related to the earth spirits and deceased ancestors are of her domain. These cults, which normally play a dominant political and social role in the homogeneous societies of which they are a part, include the powerful Ogboni society for men and the Oro and Egungun ancestral cults. Regular ritual ceremonies and festivals are held in all towns and villages to worship and propitiate the ap- propriate gods, to insure the blessing of the ancestors, and to exorcise or placate potentially destructive spirits. Ceremonies to consult the divination spirit of Ifa or placate his counterpart, the trickster Esu, are often an integral part of such festivals. Music, singing, poetic incantation, and dancing play an essential role in the public aspects of these festivals in displays, in the market places, or in processions through the streets of the town, normally following sacrificial rites in the shrines which are exclusive to celebrants and initiates. 282</page><page sequence="4">HARPER: DANCE IN NIGERIA Sango, the god of thunder, is regarded as the deified Alafin of Oyo, and his cult is mainly found among the Oyo Yoruba. Following the ritual sacri- fices, the possession priests perform dances to express the strength and swift surprise of the wrathful attacks of the "hard" god, using complex foot and body rhythms which follow the sharp insistent rhythms of the leading Bata drum. Two or four priests may dance in unison facing each other, using ges- tures symbolizing thunder and lightning. The ritual role of the Sango priests has subsidiary functions in the spheres of socio-political organization and entertainment. In Oshogbo and neighboring villages, on subsequent days of the festival the priests pay homage to the Oba in his palace and entertain the townspeople in the market square with feats of endurance and popular conjuring tricks. The woman devotees of the Sango cult in Iseyin perform dances of great precision and delicacy of movement as they sing the praises of the god. They dance in unison in a circular formation, and their leader, who wears a dis- tinctive costume,breaks away in a skillful solo performance. Throughout Yorubaland the chief celebrants of various cults perform masked dances. In the Epa and Elefon cults of Ekiti country the mask itself is regarded as the reincarnated form of the deity. The Epa masks are carved from a single piece of wood and consist of a hood fitting over the head of the carrier on which rests a superstructure of carved figures that may reach five feet in height. The masks of Elefon are double-faced, and in Igbole-Ekiti they are completely covered in white cock's feathers, with four protruding eyes. The masks are kept in a shrine where sacrifices and prayers are offered. At the annual festival they are decorated and worn by specially selected men drawn from appropriate age groups. They move through the streets of the village visiting shrines and places of ritual significance, the palace, and houses of dig- nitaries where they perform dances to the accompaniment of songs and music. The mere carrying of the heavy masks requires feats of strength of the mask wearers, Oje, who in addition perform the formal foot patterns of the dance. The devotees follow the mask, singing songs of praise and supplication and performing definite dance patterns at appointed places. The Gelede societies of the Egbado, Ahori, Nago, and Ketu peoples of the Western Yoruba are essentially fertility cults. The masquerade figures ap- pear at the annual festival and dance in the market place and through the streets of the villlage in order to placate the witches of the community, who have power over life and death, and so persuade them to use their supernat- ural powers for positive rather than negative ends. The carriers are chosen year- ly by the elders of the society from among the young men who have shown skill in the appropriate dances. They are elaborately costumed and wear cap-shaped wooden masks, carved and painted to represent formalized faces surmounted by a great variety of objects-from motor-bicycles to elaborate symbolic 283</page><page sequence="5">HARPER: DANCE IN NIGERIA forms-which represent the good things of this life and stand against the evil practices of the witches. In the village of Ijio on the first night of the festival the men and women devotees of the Bolojo group perform the dances and songs of the Efe ceremony. They dance in unison in a circle to the rhythms of the Ososo drums, executing strong sustained foot patterns in preparation for the appearance of the Efe mask which has special powers to charm and placate the witches. At midnight the lesser Tetede mask appears to dance and call on the Efe to make his dramatic entry through a ceremonial gate of palm leaves. The Efe is carried by the elder of the town. He is accompanied by the masqueraders who are exceptional dancers. Tetede, as the female masquerader, wears pointed wooden breasts and performs rapid stamping and jumping move- ments, holding the arms close to the body or stretched out on either side. The male Efe masquerader is heavily padded, elaborately costumed, and wears the most spectacular mask of the ceremony. He performs wide turning and swing- ing movements kicking his legs and using his arms extensively. On the follow- ing day a number of the masks appear through the ceremonial gates at the market place in identical pairs. The female masks dance in the style of Tetede and the male use the more energetic movement of the Efe mask. The Gelede society of Ijio has lately developed a dance performance de- signed to entertain visitors to the village or for travel abroad to compete at regional arts festivals. This dance is distinct from the ritual performance in function but makes use of the dance patterns of the Gelede ceremonies. The dancers, who call themselves the "Bolojo team," dance in a linear formation headed by the male elders of the society followed by four female masks with the elders of the women devotees bringing up the rear. The performance starts with the Bolojo music and songs, and the performers dance forward and back- ward in strict formation and unison. Later the masks break away to perform their characteristic solo dances, and the performance concludes with all the dancers performing the Bolojo movement patterns in a large circle. (The wom- en's dance is singular in that the rhythmic beat of the shoulders is developed in such a way that the scapular bones move to an extraordinary extent.) Thus a ritual society has created an entertainment form of marked choreographic complexity, unusual in a traditional context, which earns money and prestige for the community. The Egungun is an earth cult centering round the appearance of masked figures which are feared and respected as the reincarnated ancestors of the community. There is great variety in the forms of Egungun masquerade among the Yoruba. In some areas the heavily clothed masks move rather than dance; in others they have elaborate and distinctive dances. The Ekusi section of Owo town has several types of Egungun masquer- ade: the Ijamuja, the Ede, and the Egunre. All parts of the masquerader's body are covered and he assumes a "spirit voice" in representing an ancestral 284</page><page sequence="6">HARPER: DANCE IN NIGERIA figure. The Ijamuja may wear brightly painted face masks of anthropomorphic design and their clothing is covered with fresh palm fronds as they parade or rush through the streets brandishing brooms to clear the town of evil spirits in preparation first for the Ede and later for the senior Egunre masqueraders. It is taboo for the different classes to meet. The Ede wear cloth, palm fronds, and colorful feathered headdresses, while the Egunre have few palm fronds and carry carved wooden masks on the top of their heads often in the shape of a sun helmet decorated with feathers. The Ede may appear during the day, but the Egunre come only at night when they move through the town visiting households and receiving supplications, particularly from barren women pray- ing for children and pregnant women praying for a successful delivery. The masks use the sacred Afose horn to bestow a blessing or curse as they see fit. The Ede and Egunre chant incantations of proverbial wisdom and perform dances in which each masquerader follows the rhythms of gongs and sekere rattles in his own style of the accepted dance of skillful foot patterns (Kongwe) and turns (Ema) which make spectacular use of the cloth costume. The festival lasts for thirty-nine days during which a great variety of masks appear, accompanied at times by those Olorisa women related to an Egungun family who perform their own specific dance. The Egungun masqueraders are guardians of the traditional social structure and codes of morality within the society. In Abeokuta the Eegun toko festival is heralded by the midnight visit of the great spirit Agan, traditional executor of witches. As yet it would be inconceivable that these masks should dance as entertainers outside the con- text of their ritual function. Related to the Egungun societies but distinct in function, personnel, and appearance are the Egungun entertainment masquerades. These groups appear to have no ritual significance but work as professional or semiprofessional entertainers touring the villages of their neighborhood to earn money as well as appearing at the time of the Egungun festival and on invitation at marriages or funeral ceremonies. In some communities they make their initial ap- pearance from the sacred grove together with the "serious" masqueraders and seem to be regarded as a junior form of ancestral masquerader. The Ado de yo group at Ogboro and the Pake-nge group at Shepeteri wear carved masks and perform dances of great originality satirizing people of various ethnic origins and representing animals or mythological creatures in song, mime, dance, and a wide range of costumes. The Owo Lake group in Iseyin includes virtuoso acrobatic dancers. Practically every Yoruba town has such a company of skilled dancers, actors, and musicians who perform with verve and wit, con- tinuously creating "acts" which express new elements or ridicule strangers in the community. A characteristic feature is the skill with which they change costume in public without exposing their bodies by the use of large cloth cov- erings in which they also dance. They are well known for their delight in obscene mimetic jokes which are much appreciated by their audiences. 285</page><page sequence="7">HARPER: DANCE IN NIGERIA Among the ancestral Egungun masks the most remarkable dancers are the Egungun Elewe of the Igbomina people in northern Yoruba country. Dur- ing the festival in Ila, Oro, and neighboring towns, the Elewe, who form one of the four Egungun groups of the area, perform virtuoso dances requiring great technical and acrobatic skill to the rhythm of a Bata drum ensemble. One or two masqueraders belonging to a specific compound, or a group of masqueraders may perform in the streets, at the palace of the Orangun, or in the compound of a related dignitary. But even when dancing in a group each performer improvises within the form of the accepted movements to the beat of the leading drum. They are singular in their costume, which leaves one arm and both feet exposed and allows for far greater freedom of movement than most Egungun costumes. The study of a single Yoruba village reveals a great diversity of dance styles with distinctive functions. In Ipele village of the Owo district the ritual dances include the Ire Orisa dances for the Olorisa cult for women, the Agherebe dance for the worshippers of Uja, the god of hunting, and the Igede dance of the Balalawo and initiates of the cult of Osanyin, the god of medi- cine. There are the Laghalogbo dancers of the Ogun worshippers as well as the dances of the Egungun masqueraders. The Oba and his chief express the authority of their office in the Olosorope dance and the Ogagago dance of the elders. There are distinctive dances for the various age groups, including the Igharo group for men over the age of sixty-five years who perform the Gbegberekutu dance at the Ero festival when the initiation of a new member into the age group is celebrated. The Arile dance for nubile unmarried girls between the ages of thirteen and eighteen is performed especially at Egungun and Obanifon festivals. The Igbade is the dance for men belonging to the first four age groups and is designed to keep them strong and active while the spec- tators sing to urge the dancers to perform daring acrobatic feats. The Arokogo music and dance encourages farmers to work with energy, and the Ida is an acrobatic dance for young men particularly popular among farmers. The Igogo dance is performed by young men at funeral ceremonies and consists of jumping and stamping movements which pack the loose earth of the grave firmly into position. Bembe music and dancing is used during funeral processions, and the Olomarse singing and dancing is performed at the funerals of those who have borne children, to accompany a procession of the relations of the deceased as they carry a mock coffin through the streets of the village. The stately Totorigi dancing is for senior men and women at mar- riage and naming ceremonies, while the male teenagers perform the lively Ajabure with ceremonial swords. There is a great range of recreational dances, for new forms are contin- uously invented to suit the current fashion in popular music and dress. The sustained and stately Ireso dance is an old form which has remained popular. 286</page><page sequence="8">HARPER: DANCE IN NIGERIA The Gbedu belongs to the young men and women of a particular club who meet socially and organize fund raising projects. Araba is for married men and women, the Are for middle-aged, well-established members of the community, the Akula for girls only, and the Ayu for young men and women. These dances of the Ipele community may dispel the misconception that there is not a great deal of variety of form and function in the dances of the Yoruba, for each form has its distinctive music, song, and dance movements. Though the misconception may arise from the fact that much of the social and recrea- tional dance of the Yoruba is subtle and intricate in design, everyday move- ments are almost imperceptibly stylized into a fine complexity of rhythmic patterns. Each dancer improvises within the accepted patterns of movement, finding his own way among the group of dancers. There is no overall organ- ized floor pattern, and a performer is assessed on his ability to interpret the basic pattern of the dance with a personal dynamic which follows the rhythmic improvisations of a master musician. The outstanding feature of Yoruba dance is the complex of dynamics and rhythm, which binds the move- ment to the music, and the elaborate and intricate use of cloth and costume as an extension of spatial movements which move through a subtle grading of positions rather than from one definite spatial position to the next. By contrast, the Ibo of Eastern Nigeria are among the many peoples who perform dances of social or occupational significance in organized dance teams. The performers follow the leading dancer through a series of formal- ized movement patterns which have been set in a definite sequence prior to performance. In the Etilogwu dance of the Akwa area in Ibo country, a dancer is assessed not only on his verve and precision of movement but as a disciplined member of the team whose dance is based on a geometric floor pattern. The Lopawa, Gungawa, Shangawa, and Kamberi people in Yauri and Borgu are among the many peoples of Northern Nigeria who perform dances of varying degrees of formal complexity on a circular ground plan with the musicians in a central position. Predetermined rhythmic and spatial movement patterns are performed by the appropriate age groups in male or female teams for occupational and social purposes. In the midwest state, Ijaw dancers from the western delta and dancers from Fugar, Ishan, Agbor, and neighboring areas perform ritual and social dances in ensembles from which soloists emerge to make virtuoso contribu- tions, thus maintaining a balance between group movement and individual creativity. As previously indicated, although the function of a dance has obvious and decisive effects on the emergence of the form, the dance form remains rooted, in terms of rhythmic, dynamic, and spatial patterning, in the physical circumstances and movement habits of the particular culture. 287</page><page sequence="9">HARPER: DANCE IN NIGERIA DANCE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENT As with the Yoruba, the people who traditionally dress in robes and cloth, such as the Hausa, Nupe, Kanuri and Fulani peoples of NorthernNige- ria, use material as an extension of their movements to create the spatial pat- terns and gesture of their dance in terms of volume rather than linear design. Whereas in the dances of the Kamberi and Lopawa of Borgu, who wear a minimal covering of animal skins or cloth, the body movements are seen in their own terms and are normally more athletic and less subtle than their clothed neighbors. These dancers often carry symbolic or functional objects such as spears or axes. The nature of the physical locality in which people live radically affects their daily movements and subsequently their dance movements. In farming areas, where people have a familiar and confident relationship with the solid earth, the clearly defined rhythmic patterns are often accented by the dancers placing their feet firmly and squarely on the earth; in the delta region, where the villages are regularly flooded and people spend much of the lives in canoes, the dancers move rapidly and subtly in intricate rhythms from one part of the foot to another as though maintaining a delicate balance on an unstable surface. The design of houses and the domestic arrangement of households de- velop habitual sitting, sleeping, and occupational body positions which affect posture and muscular development and are reflected in dance movements. In many societies people are at ease when squatting on their haunches or sitting on low stools. These positions stretch the tendons and develop the leg muscles in such a way that deep knee bends and squatting are performed without strain in their dances. This may be seen in the Icough dance of the women's ensembles of southern Tiv country. Occupational movements play a decisive role in the formation of dance movement patterns. Women in rural areas often cook or work at ground level from a standing position which entails bending the torso forward from the hips while the knees are used continuously for bending and stretching and the whole foot remains firmly on the ground. This is a body position commonly used by men and women in agricultural work, and it should be noted that the back is seldom curved but normally held straight. Another common working position at ground level is achieved by sitting on the ground with a straight torso which may be upright or inclined forward, the legs opened at a wide angle. The practice among rural women of carrying loads on the head results in a walk in which the undulations of the ground surface are taken up in the flexibility of the hips and knees whereas the ankles remain relatively rigid and the head remains in a consistently upright position so as not to upset the ob- jects carried. This practice strengthens the muscles of the neck and back, con- 288</page><page sequence="10">HARPER: DANCE IN NIGERIA tributes towards the habit of the straight-backed torso with the head and neck carried as an extension of the line of the back, and develops a marked flexi- bility in the pelvic region. These and many other occupational patterns of movement are reflected in the basic body positions which recur in many forms of Nigerian dance. A characteristic body posture in dance consists of a strong straight-backed torso with the legs used as springs, the knees bending and stretching fluidly in executing the rhythmic and action patterns of the dances, and the feet placed firmly on the ground. The torso may be held upright or at an angle inclined towards the earth. This angle may be slight or at varying degrees to the ex- treme extent of the upper body being held parallel to the ground surface. The head and neck are held as an extension of the line of the back so that the attention of the dancer is directed at right angles to the body line. This means that when the torso is inclined forward the position of the dancer's body, his attention, and often his body weight and gestures are directed into rather than away from the earth on which he is dancing. This feature of many forms of dance does not imply that the dancers invariably stamp or are heavy on their feet. There are many instances in which the performers use their weight posi- tively in stamping foot patterns, but there are as many in which the feet are used with a rapid, light dynamic and there remains an overall impression of a positive relation between the dancer and the earth on which he moves. (In strong contrast, there are many forms of European dance where movements are primarily concerned with the geometric patterning in spatial terms and escape from the ground surface.) While this is a recurrent tendency rather than a generalization, obvious exceptions are acrobatic performances such as the Ikhien-ani-mhin dances of the Ishan people of the midwest state. The flexibility of knees and hips as seen in the walk of women carrying loads is a stylized feature of dance patterns of many forms of women's danc- ing and is often taken up in the men's dances. It is a typical feature of Yoruba dances, and in the delta region the dancing of the Nembe and Kalabari is characterized by a rapid shift of weight in the hips and legs result- ing in "quivering" movement patterns of the buttocks accentuated by the for- ward inclination of the upper body. The Kanuri women of the Maidugari area use a subtle rapid transference of weight in the hips with an upright body posture which gives a shimmering effect through their loosely flowing gar- ments. The male and female dancing in Agbor is based upon strong contrac- tion-release patterns of movement in the pelvis and upper torso. The implicit use of occupational gestures may be clearly seen in the repetitive gathering-scattering arm gestures and patting movements of the hands in the Icough dance of the Tiv women who do light agricultural work. Apart from many such instances of the unconscious adaptation of occupation- al movements where is considerable conscious or explicit stylization of oc- 289</page><page sequence="11">HARPER: DANCE IN NIGERIA cupational movements in dances throughout Nigeria, as in Yelwa town, where many of the dances of the Hausa and Nupe women are based on mimetic reenactments of the working movements of the men of their community. The Makera dance illustrates the hammering of the blacksmiths, the Nama Hausa mimes the actions of the meat sellers, and the Rawan Gwandon Kifi illustrates the work of the fishermen in casting nets and using spears and fish traps, each dance being accompanied by appropriate songs. It should be stressed that the fundamental formal element in all forms of dance in Nigeria is based on the close relationship between the rhythmic movement patterns of the dancer and the percussive rhythms of the ac- companying music or song. In many instances the dancers wear or carry rat- tles or bells, so providing or contributing to the accompaniment. Dance move- ments are bound to the musical accompaniment by metric patterns which form the basis of rhythmic patterns. Metric patterns are normally composed of equally spaced beats or are the sum of different numbers of time units in terms of beats. The basic metric pattern is often established at the outset of the dance by a shift of weight in the dancers body. Rhythmic movement pat- terns are then developed by movements used to accent certain metric beats while leaving others unaccented, forming a pattern of stresses which progress to a point of culmination or repose thus forming a rhythmic phrase in terms of visualized movement. A dance may have a repetitive rhythmic phrase con- tinuing throughout the performance, which is typical of Kamberi dancing. Or the initial rhythm may develop in complexity during the performance in a set development, as with the Urhobo, or in terms of improvisation typical of Yoruba dance. The drummer normally leads the improvisation but there are instances of the dancer leading or an exchange of initiative between the close- ly related dancer and musician. It is common for an individual dancer to com- bine two rhythms simultaneously in his dance movement; a combination of three distinct rhythms may be used by a highly skilled dancer, and four simul- taneous rhythms are rarely observed. In the circular dances of the agricultural people of northern Nigeria the repetitive rhythmic patterns of one dance usually remain constant in tempo, different rhythms and possibly changes in tempo being established in subsequent dances. The Urhobo people of the mid- west are remarkable for the variety of complex and simultaneous body rhythms initiated at a slow tempo and accelerating during the performance to a rapid climax at the end of the dance, a technique which may send the per- formers into a state of trance or possession. In the dances of the Egungun Elewe, referred to earlier, the improvised rhythmic patterns within the estab- lished range of movement vary constantly in tempo. 290</page><page sequence="12">HARPER: DANCE IN NIGERIA NEO-TRADITIONAL AND CONTEMPORARY FORMS OF DANCE The traditional cultures are now in a state of transition, and the dance, as an integral expression of the life of these cultures, is changing radically and rapidly, for dance is an emphemeral art and readily absorbs new elements and reflects changes in the surrounding society. I have referred to traditional dance as the first world or category of dance in Nigeria. The second emerges from the first and includes dances which are derived from traditional forms but serve a fundamentally different func- tion in a non-traditional context. These dances are popularly included under the umbrella term of "traditional," but for present purposes I shall refer to them as "neo-traditional." In the traditional context, audience and performers are members of a closely knit homogeneous community, and the form of the dance is familiar to all members of the society. The spectators attend a per- formance to appreciate and assess the re-enactment of the familiar and to assure that new elements accord with the dance tradition. In many cases they participate in the dance formally or spontaneously, and the spatial limits of the performance are set by their physical presence. There is seldom a definite time limit set to the dance, as the repetitive rhythms form a focus for the overall rhythms of the life of the community. For generations these societies have lived in a rural economy, and the advent of urbanized industrial centers has affected even remote rural villages by opening up travel and educational facilities and developing new economic needs. In many areas a village dance group can now travel to areas where their dance is unfamiliar, and they are able to earn money as entertainers. There is a gradual but steady transference of dances which have evolved as an expres- sion of a traditional culture to situations of performance for a cross-section of foreign cultures. The closely knit organic audience-performer relationship of the traditional context is replaced by an impersonal one with an audience that pays for entertainment. They demand variety of material and economy in presenta- tion to hold their interest over a limited period of time. The meeting of these demands immediately affects the form of the dance: movement patterns are simplified, spectacular elements are stressed at the expense of the more subtle rhythms and movements, and definite limits in terms of time and space radi- cally alter the ground plan and overall organization and attitude of the dancers towards their own performance. Dance themes observed in the new setting are introduced, and costumes and movements are tailored to meet standards of decency in the new environment. Festivals of art and similar events encourage and accelerate this transition from traditional to neo-trad- itional dance. In the urban context, groups of people of the same ethnic origin organize dance groups as a way of preserving their identity and earning money in a foreign environment. Students at schools, colleges, and universities 291</page><page sequence="13">HARPER: DANCE IN NIGERIA perform modernized versions of the traditional dances of their home areas to entertain their fellow students in programs of cultural exchange. Some neo- traditional dance groups turn professional and travel extensively, adding to their repertoire from new sources and creating dances which are mere reflec- tions of their original forms. The third category or world of dance is the contemporary. Industrial urban centers use contemporary international forms of communication which must be met in Nigerian terms. Material is created specifically for modern theater, television, and film by directors, playwrights, and choreographers who draw on traditional material as an inspiration and springboard for the creation of contemporary work. Unlike the neo-traditional forms these works are con- ceived and planned by artists rather than evolving in a relatively haphazard manner to meet the needs of a contemporary audience. The professional Yoruba opera companies tour the towns and villages of Western Nigeria as a full-time occupation. They are organized, trained, and di- rected by actor/managers who write the material, compose the music, and ar- range the dances, drawing freely on the traditions with which they are famili- ar. Sequences from traditional dances are used to convey dramatic concepts or provide moments of entertainment. The staging of plays written in English by Nigerian playwrights often calls for the performance of traditional dances in theatrical terms which requires a choreographer to adapt the dances for the contemporary stage and television studio. The School of Drama of the University of Ibadan has, over the past four years, included dance as one of the many subjects in the curriculum. The stu- dents practice technical dance exercises based on movements drawn from tra- ditional dances and use the resulting technique in productions of dance dramas designed and directed by a choreographer. Such works demand a theatrical attitude towards the basic material, and dance movements are used dramatically and formally with no reference to their ethnic origin. The development of neo-traditional and theatrical forms of dance is in the true Nigerian tradition: dance and its related arts meet the requirements of the society of which they are a part. It is useless to decry the disappear- ance of old forms and false to attempt to preserve traditional dances out of their proper context. But the dance forms that remain a vital expression of traditional societies should be recorded without delay using the most reliable and comprehensive means available. These records will be of obvious historical and sociological value and are essential as the raw material for the theater of the future. The Institutes of African Studies of the University of Ife and the Universi- ty of Ibadan has initiated dance studies at an academic level. The project on hand is designed to locate the dance material in the field;to record this material; to or- ganize it for archive and library use at the University; to make the material avail- 292</page><page sequence="14">HARPER: DANCE IN NIGERIA able to study centers; to analyze the form of the dance and publish the results to- gether with data on background, setting, and function. The material is located with the assistance of informants in the field who notify the Institute of dance events and supply data on the function and social context of dance performances and related occasions. The sociological aspect of the work is largely reliant upon the cooperation of linguists and sociologists conversant with the life and language of the areas studied. RECORDING AND ANALYSIS In selecting and handling techniques for recording dance it is essential to bear in mind that dance is an art in terms of human bodies moving in space and time, and that space and time are cultural constructs rather than physical facts. It is essential that the recording technique provide an objective repro- duction enabling the dance to be seen in its own terms, as free as possible from personal or alien assumptions. As dance is a kinetic art inseparably bound to music, it follows that an accurate recording calls for a medium able to record movement and sound in visual and aural terms. For this reason the Institutes of African Studies, in conjunction with the Ford Foundation Film Project, are using synchronized sound film which provides material that may be used as a source of verification for further analysis and future study. The cur- rent methods of transcription, such as dance notations, are too reliant on personal and cultural factors to be trusted as a basic recording medium. Nota- tions, which are symbolic languages used extensively in Europe and America to record dancing, are based on European dance and work movements where the accent is on movement patterns readily lending themselves to symbolic representation within a geometrically conceived spatial area. In European dance the emphasis is on the performer moving from one distinct spatial position to the next, whereas dancers in Africa often move through a subtle complex of spatial gradings with the emphasis on the rhythmo-dynamic aspects of the movement and the closely knit relationship between movement and music. As the complexities of African music often defy European musical notation, so a comprehensive notation for dance in Africa is yet to be evolved. Work in this direction could be based on a wide range of reliable film recordings, but the need and justification for notation in Africa is question- able as it is a complex symbolic language only accessible to those conversant with it. The film team recording dance includes a professional filmmaker able to deal with the technical problems of filming in the field, a musicologist, and a choreographer to ensure that essential elements are covered. The traditional dances are, when possible, filmed in their authentic setting where they serve 293</page><page sequence="15">HARPER: DANCE IN NIGERIA the purpose for which they came into being, as an artificial separation of function and form can be deleterious to the performance. The present film team is using a soundless battery-driven camera synchro- nized to a high-fidelity portable tape recorder and a radio microphone which dis- penses with wires and enables the microphone to be placed in the best position with minimum amount of disturbance to the performers. A 35 mm. still camera capable of taking a number of pictures in rapid sequence is used to cover addi- tional material. After shooting is completed the film is processed and a working copy made which is used for editing films to be used in the study of the form of the dance. These films include long shots of the entire ensemble, close-ups of the musicians, and details of the dance movements with emphasis on the es- sential aspects of the movement from a choreographic point of view. No at- tempt has been made to set the dance in its social environment on film, but an account of the setting and purpose of the dance will be published in a catalogue to accompany the film. Longer films dealing with festivals and rituals which include dance are planned. A first generation copy of the musical tape is placed in the archive of traditional music. A comprehensive copy of the unedited film remains in a film archive, available to those wishing to study the original material or make alternative edited versions. The edited film with synchronized sound is avail- able for showing at the University and copies are made available on order from centers further abroad. Reels of film based on edited excerpts from a number of contrasting styles of dance are used to illustrate lectures at the University and are useful as material for comparative studies of style and form. Written analysis of dance form is based on the film material. Camera and projection techniques are proving to be of assistance in analysis. The slow-motion film, which is helpful in the defining of spatial design and body positions, is ideally produced in the camera by running film at a fast speed through the camera and projecting the print at normal speed. But it can also be done by a variable speed, slow motion projector such as the Dutch Analec- tar which is variable between one and twenty-four frames per second and gives the necessary flicker-free picture. The use of solarization techniques achieves a pure silhouette outlining of the dancer's body on film, giving the essential po- sitions without details. Telecine and television monitors may also be used to vary the negative-positive balance and contrast of the print and so highlight the spatial patterns of the movement. The all important study of the relation- ship of movement and musical rhythms is facilitated by producing film loops so that when projected a particular movement or movement sequence can be viewed repeatedly. Coincident loops of picture and sound are made by print- ing the visual material on one loop and transferring the sound to 16 mm. mag- 294</page><page sequence="16">HARPER: DANCE IN NIGERIA netic. These loops are then run in synchronism. Siemen's double-headed pro- jector is ideal for running picture and sound on separate film in synchroniza- tion. When a satisfactory analysis of the form is completed, studies on the relation of form and content and comparative cross-cultural analyses will be attempted. The study of dance in Africa is in its initial stages. I will make a final plea for the urgency of this work and for a responsible attitude by those in- volved in the application of foreign techniques in the recording and analysis, for throughout Africa dance is regarded as a major art and an integral func- tion of life at every level of society.
