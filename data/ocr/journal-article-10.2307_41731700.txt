Often neglected or at best given passing ac- knowledgment by dirt archaeologists, the petroglyphs and pictographs of the United States deserve serious survey and appraisal, especially in graphic form. Al- though there are numerous books about rock art and at least one highly active organization (the American Rock Art 72 ARCHAEOLOGY Research Association) publishes a quar- terly newsletter and regular volumes of its annual symposium papers, films and video depictions of this valuable cultural heritage are sadly lacking. Too often they center on a single culture, as in the case of Rock Art of the Chumash, or concen- trate on a single thesis, as in The Sun Dagger. It was with high hopes that we greeted the announcement of Rock Art Trea- sures of Ancient America, a film covering three different major sites in California- the Coso Range, the Colorado River intaglios, and the Chumash cave paint- ings. Unfortunately, this is not the film to fill the void. Its strengths are out- weighed by some glaring deficiencies. One of the major problems facing a motion picture producer is how to get a feeling of movement from a basically static subject such as rock art, which is painted and inscribed on rocks and cave walls and is thus frozen into a somnam- bulant symbol. Rock Art Treasures does a fine job of imbuing these changeless artifacts with a sense of action through camera movement, zoom shots and jux- taposed graphics. The opening sequences in particular are visually striking, with colorful imagery of various archaeologi- cal sites which immediately captures the viewer's attention. The filmmaker's approach to interpre- tation, at least at the beginning, is cautious, and the film sets down the solid thesis that rock art is the legacy of Native Americans and is not to be at- tributed to extra-terrestrials. This state- ment is especially important today, when At the moment of the winter solstice sunrise , a beam of light illumi- nates the pictograph of a man painted on a cave wall in La Rumorosa , Baja, California . From Watcher of the Winter Sun.</page><page sequence="2">the lunatic fringes of archaeology bom- bard the public in print and film with their preposterous ideas. But, alack, the film abruptly departs from this cautious approach and plunges into some deep water with bold statements that would be better identified as assumptions. The first of these is that the "original natives who lived in the Coso Range were the Shoshone Indians," and that "there is evidence to support the theory that the carvings are the symbols of the tribe's religious feelings and beliefs." The "evidence" is suspect at best, and the more the rock art of the Coso Range is studied, the more questions about its origin and meaning emerge. However, its real weakness is combining inter- spersed and superimposed shots of the petroglyphs with a Shoshonean myth of Coyote. This juxtaposition of undeci- pherable rock art with legend gives a false impression that what we are seeing is a graphic representation of what we are hearing. The narration not only implies but boldly states that the "sym- bolism of this myth provides a further interpretation of the rock art of the Coso Range," a grievous error. A specific ex- ample of this is the sequence in which an anthropomorphic petroglyph with a rather realistically portrayed vulva is shown just as the narrator indicates that the figure is the male coyote. The Coyote myth is narrated by Dugan Hansen, a Shoshone Indian, which tends to add credence to the spoken word and leads to the viewer's acceptance of the rock art images as visual support for the thesis. While this may be questionable in the context of the Shoshonean/Coso Range rock art, at least it conveys a feel- ing of authenticity. However, when the film moves to the Colorado River to view the giant intaglios near Blythe, in Mojave Indian country, the producer chooses a Tarahumara as narrator. This tactic perpetuates a long-standing mis- conception-that any Indian in this country can be a spokesperson for all Indians. The error is compounded when the narrator mispronounces several tribal names. Moreover, presentation of pic- tures of the intaglios, splendidly photo- graphed from the air, while the legend of Masthamo (the Giant) is told makes them seem to be actual depictions of the myth, a conclusion that presently is with- out sufficient archaeological evidence. When the camera turns to the magnifi- cent pictographs of the Chumash it re- cords some of the finest rock art in North America. Much of the photography is exquisite, reproducing in full and true color the fine paintings of this remark- able site. As with the Coso Range and the Colorado River intaglios, the filmmaker allows the camera to drift slowly, linger- ing on the artwork with a perceptive eye. Far from being a long, boring look at this static subject, this gentle lingering view brings out the viewer's most con- templative moods. This is an excellent lesson in the pho- tographic documentation of rock art. The drawback? The film continues, as in the earlier sections, to "depict" Chumash leg- end (narrated by a Chumash Indian) through the rock art, which to even the untrained eye often does not come close to a pictorial representation of what is being said. Perhaps in an attempt to counteract this discrepancy, the film- maker seems to have had a high old time during editing with the Special Effects Generator- colorful splashes of the Chumash paintings fairly fly off the screen and dance about as if set in mo- tion by some electronic game wizard. For the anthropologist, a more blatant error is the amount of interpretation of Chumash rock art, with specific photo- graphs identified with specific supernat- ural beings. The cautious approach of the film's beginning is cast aside in favor of a more absolutist approach. Rock Art Treasures of Ancient Amer- ica ends with an important statement about the destruction of rock art by weather and vandalism, and with a plea for our generation to leave a better leg- acy than demolition and degradation of this fine artform to future generations. Aerial shots of U.S. Army tank tracks stitching the desert dunes near Yuma is graphic proof of man's penchant for destroying the base of his own culture. This film is bound to find its way into schools and possibly public television. ~ As important as it is to acquaint and educate the world to the significance of rock art, however, the supposition that the petroglyphs and pictographs fea- tured in this film are graphic examples of legend simply is not correct. The an- thropologist and archaeologist will see the fallacy in the film's argument, but unfortunately the casual viewer and those to whom the world of rock art is a new segment of our Native American legacy most likely will not. â–¡ Frank Bock is Professor of Anthropol- ogy/ Archaeology at Cerritos College , Norwalk, CA, and is a Founding/ Charter member of the American Rock Art Re- search Association.</page></plain_text>
