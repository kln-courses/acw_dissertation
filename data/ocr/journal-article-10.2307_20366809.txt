<plain_text><page sequence="1">BRITIlSH MEDICAL JOURNAL LONDON SATURDAY JULY 6 1946 THE EVOLUTION OF CLINICAL MEDICINE AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE HISTORY OF EPILEPSY BY GORDON HOLMES, M.D., F.R.C.P., F.R.S. To all who have been for some years eng,ged in the practice of clinical medicine it is obvious that important developments in the diagnosis of many diseases have taken place during the period of their professional life, but many are apt to forget how recent is the acquisition of much knowledge. Hughlings Jackson, to whom I was house-physician, was accustomed to say he had been a neurologist many years before the knee-jerk was first described, and I had almost passed out of studentship when Babinski drew attention to that type of pathological plantar reflex which has become such a valuable sign in the diagnosis of nervous disorders. Advances in treatment are per haps more striking, but as rational therapeutics depend on recognition of the nature of the disease, diagnosis is evidently the first essential step in progress. In many instances recognition of the nature and origin of a morbid condition has developed suddenly as a result of careful clinical observation, as the distinction of typhus from enteric fever; by the demonstration of constant and characteristic anatomical changes associated with it; and, more critically, by the discovery of a specific causal factor, as the infecting organism of an infectious illness. Sometimes, however, it has been due to introduction of new methods of investigation, as the use of the electrocardiograph in that branch of medicine in which the founder of this lecture is a recognized authority. More frequently the differentiation of separate diseases as seen through the centuries has been a long and slow process which has been retarded by failure to follow the straight path in the maze of clinical experience, by misinterpretation of ob servations, and particularly by failure to observe accurately and correlate clinical symptoms with morbid anatomy. And as most symptoms are disturbances of function, diagnosis has had in many cases to follow in the wake of physiology. But the history of medicine reveals another and even more serious obstacle to progress which must be impressed on the student, or rather postgraduate, of to-day: it is too faithful submission to authority and failure to reason independently from facts observed. This will be evident in the subject I have selected to illustrate the evolution of clinical medicine. Many diseases might be chosen for this purpose, and the story of some might be more instructive, but, owing to the dramatic manifestations of epilepsy, its occurrence and views on its nature and pathology have been recorded since the dawn of history. Perhaps I have also been prompted to talk to you on the history of epilepsy by a subconscious memory of a state ment by Oliver Wendell Holmes: "If I wished to show a student the difficulties of getting at truth from clinical experience I would give him the history of epilepsy to read." An accurate definition of terms should be the first step in any discussion, and it is particularly necessary here, as history has recently repeated itself in a tendency to extend the connotation of the term "epilepsy": many, in fact, now speak of several types of convulsions and other episodic phenomena as belonging to " the epilepsies." It will, however, suffice to state that here it is proposed to deal only with so-called idiopathic epilepsy -that is. a chronic disease without gross structural changes, characterized by periodic attacks of loss of consciousness with or without convulsions or other symptoms. It is evident that in dealing with the early history of any morbid condition one must distinguish between the views of-the layman and those of the physician. This is often difficult, as they may include in it different clinical entities-in fact, speak of different conditions. It is particularly so in the history of epilepsy, with which, till early in the nineteenth century, hysteria, vertigo, trances, the religious ecstatic states so common in the Middle Ages, and other conditions were often confused by both the profession and the people. But, on the whole, a fairly clear picture of genuine epilepsy is presented in early literature. Views of the Greeks Scientific medicine-that is, direct clinical observation and application of reason to the facts observed--came to birth in Greece about the end of the fifth century B.C. Some of the medical knowledge then possessed by the Greeks may have been derived from earlier Arabian and Egyptian physicians, but the empirical practice of the East was from this period largely replaced by attempts at a materialistic interpretation of the universe and of vital phenomena. The earliest contribution to epilepsy that we possess is a treatise by Hippocrates or by a member of his school, On the Sacred Disease, written about the middle of the fifth century B.C. It contains an attack on the superstitions of the people, and probably of physicians too, who had regarded it as a disease of divine origin. It is therefore evident that epilepsy, or con ditions confused with it, was recognized by previous generations. In the Hippocratic monograph it is insisted that all illnesses have natural or material causes and that epilepsy is no more sacred or divine than other diseases. It is not due to the wrath of the Gods, demoniac possession, or other extraneous in fluences. Divine and supernatural influences were denied, and anthropomorphic and religious theories of earlier philosophers and priests were replaced by a pathology that was the first step in scientific knowledge. The clinical descriptions are excellent, and contain many ob servations that were overlooked during the next two thousand years. It was recognized that epilepsy rarely starts after the age of 20, that there is often a hereditary tendency, that its manifestations vary, that it sometimes ceases spontaneously, that attacks occur in sleep and particularly on waking, and that when associated with injury of one side of the head convulsions may be limited to the opposite side of the body. It was also observed that in chronic cases the brain may be abnormally moist-a fact well known now, as cerebrospinal fluid accumu lates on its surface and between its convolutions when its tissue atrophies. Further, epilepsy was attributed to irritation of the brain by acid or sour substances-an interesting fact, as it is the first indication of localization in it of pathological processes. 4461 * The first Price Lecture, delivered in the Queen's University, Belfast, on May 9, 1946.</page><page sequence="2">2 JULY 6, 1946 EPILEPSY AND THE EVOLUTION OF CLINICAL MEDICINE BRIJRASH As the Hippocratic school regarded epilepsy as a cerebral disease it is necessary to recall the views of the Greeks on the functions of the brain. Some years earlier Alcmaeon taught that it is the organ of mind, and that through it sense impressions reach consciousness; but this was not generally accepted by later philosophers up to the time of Hippocrates. For many subsequent years the nature and the seat of consciousness and mind occupied a dominant place in Greek philosophic discus sions, largely to the exclusion of somatic functions. Intelligence, the passions, and sensibility were by various authors referred to the heart, liver, lungs, and other visceral organs. According to Hippocrates, however, the brain is the organ of 'the mind; it is by it we think and understand, see and hear. All intellectual and moral activities depend on it ; it is the interpreter of in telligence, but intelligence is carried to it by air that circulates through the veins. If the veins are blocked by cold phlegm the patient becomes unconscious and an epileptic attack occurs. The influence of the teaching of Hippocrates is obvious in Plato's hypothesis that epilepsy is due to a mixture of white phlegm and black bile which obstructs the circulation of air to the head. But Plato's dogma that it is necessary to avoid the confusion caused by evidence afforded by the senses and to determine truth by argument alone was largely responsible for failure in advance in the natural sciences, during the follow ing sixteen centuries. The influence of his teaching persisted. though in his later writings Aristotle emphasized the necessity for observation and the importance of determining concrete facts. Aristotle attributed disease to morbid changes in the body, and refuted belief in magic and intervention of divine and demoniac agencies. Though there is no evidence that he studied anatomy or performed dissections, he repeatedly marshalled evidence to prove that the heart was the " sensorium commune" -the organ of sensation and intelligence-and that the only function of the brain was to cool and purify the blood, or rather the air or vapour that is conducted to it by the veins. He attributed epileptic seizures to these vapours being too con densed by the cold brain and therefore impeding the action of the heart when they return to it. These humoral theories favoured by Plato and Aristotle had for several centuries great influence on views on the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Although Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek philosophers sought to explain illness of the body and often afflictions of the mind by somatic or material causes, not only was the application of scientific methods to the study of man neglected by their successors, but, as the fate of Socrates shows, denial of divine intervention in natural happenings was. as it also became in later years, a dangerous heresy. Even early in the eighteenth century Hippocrates was accused of atheism. The Next Milestone The work of Galen in the second century A.D. is the next milestone in the history of epilepsy. Galen was an anatomist as well as a first-rate clinical observer ; he insisted that the brain is the organ of mind, of sensation, and of movement not merely an inert mass or a kind of cold wet sponge which cooled the humours. as some of his predecessors believed. He published excellent descriptions of the clinical features of epilepsy, and insisted that it is always due to disorder of the brain, though in certain types the brain may be affected sympathetically by disease of other organs, as the stomach. He was probably the first to describe local epilepsy. and observed that its clonic spasms may be sometimes arrested by tying a band round the limb in which they start. He observed. too, that when unilateral convulsions reach the head conscious ness is generally lost. He assumed, however, that convulsions limited to one limb were due to an affection of peripheral nerves, those involving the whole body except the face to disturbance in the spinal cord, while those in which the face was also affected originated in the brain. His view on the exciting cause of generalized convulsions was that the humour or principle on which sensation and motion depend, or by which the brain acts on, or is acted on by, the rest of the body, is elaborated in the anterior ventricles of the brain, passes through the third and fourth ventricles, and is thence distributed to the periphery. When th is humour be comes too thick or viscid its circulation is impeded. and the brain, which in its reaction he compared to the strings of a harp, is agitated and thus causes convulsions. On the other hand, accumulation of viscid humour in the substance of the brain produces changes in intelligence and temperament such as are common in epilepsy. It is interesting that he also attributed convulsions to excessive humidity, or, as we would say to-day, to hydration-a factor which has been again recog nized only within recent years. Aretaeus of Cappadocia, who practised medicine a little later than Galen, also furnished excellent descriptions of epileptic phenomena, particularly of the initial stages or aurae of seizures. He also recorded post-epileptic paresis and anaesthesia, the mental disorders that occasionally follow attacks, and the de mentia that frequently develops in chronic cases. He had apparently no doubt that seizures originate in the brain owing to disturbances in the circulation of animal spirits. As later surgeons, he found that merely opening the skull, or cauter izing the underlying brain, might arrest seizures for a time. After the philosophic age of Greek culture search into the nature of things declined except in Rome, but as here learning and research were directed to more practical or material ends there is little new in the records which have come down to us on the nature of epilepsy. That it was common among the Latins is evident. They gave it the name " morbus comitialis," as their meetings in comitia were suspended when one of those present had a seizure, since this was attributed to demoniac possession or to a malign influence of a god, who by this means indicated his disple- sure at the proceedings. In the first century B.C., however, Lucretius, who in his often-quoted verse gave an excellent and detailed description of an attack, attributed it to physical or rather humoral causes. At the onset the patient. " Struck as with lightning by some keen disease, drops sudden,' and, as the attack passes off, " The morbid cause declines, and the fermenting humours from the heart flow back." The Old Superstitions But the old superstitions still held sway. They were univer sally accepted by the people, and probably by the educated too, for, as Francis Bacon wrote, " In all superstitions wise men follow fools." It was so among the Hebrews, who were at that time under Roman rule; for both St. Matthew and St. Mark record the case of an epileptic boy, one of whose seizures occurred in the presence of Jesus, who according to St. Mark said. "Cast out the devil," or in St. Matthew's words, "the foul spirit." The characteristic abrupt cessation of the con vulsions and the rapid recovery after a brief period of coma could obviously be explained by the hypothesis that the victim had been suddenly freed from a malign possession. It is consequently not surprising that, later, demonology be came a dogma of the Church and doubt a heresy. Its influence extended through the Dark Ages of the next 1,400 years. Independent thought and investigation were largely replaced by tradition and often suppressed. Belief in witchcraft and posses sion by demons was almost universal; the Church frowned on views discordant with precedent, and Medicine relied largely on authority, which, as Sir Thomas Browne wrote, has always been a " powerful enemy unto knowledge." In the thirteenth century St. Thomas Aquinas, and two centuries later Martin Luther, admitted the possibility of possession by evil spirits, and even in the sixteenth century epilepsy was spoken of as a " demon disease." The professional reputation of Chaucer's Doctour of Phisik was based on his acquaintance with ancient Greek, Arabian, and Roman authorities and on his knowledge of the humoral pathology of Empedocles. "He knew the cause of everich maladye, Where it of hoot or cold, or moyste or dry, And where they engendred and what humour." Throughout the Middle Ages there were, so far as we know. only variations of ancient theories and little or no original research or speculation into the nature of epilepsy. Seizures were often confused with outbursts of hysteria and other con ditions, while most still believed in demoniac possession * others held that the moon and the planets could influence the occur rence of fits. Relief was consequently sought in prayer and fasting, and in magic charms and rituals. In the first half of the sixteenth century Jean Fernel, whose biological philosophy Sir Charles Sherrington has taken as the</page><page sequence="3">JULY 6, 1946 EPILEPSY AND THE EVOLUTION OF CLINICAL MEDICINE BRITISH 3 MEDICAL JOURNAL text for his Gifford Lectures, Man otn his Nature, recognized various types of epilepsy, emphasized its common hereditary tendency, attributed seizures to poisons or vapours irritating the brain, and produced pathological evidence which he thought confirmed this view. But he did not definitely exclude posses sion, for he recorded the case of a man who was regarded as an epileptic, but from the record was beyond reasonable doubt subject to hysterical seizures. in whom ' a certain devil was found to be the cause of this ill." He protested against the prevalent use of charms as a means of warding off attacks, as carrying in writing the names of the three kings who came to worship the infant Christ. A New Era in Neurology A new era in neurology was introduced by Sir Thomas Willis (1621-75), whom Soury, the historian of neurology, compared in the vividness of his imagination, brilliancy of style, and pro fundity of thought to Shakespeare. Though known chiefly as an anatomist, Willis was also a pathologist who correlated symptoms of disease with structural lesions, and a physiologist who attempted to elucidate function by relating the functional capacity of the animal to the development of different portions of the brain. He recognized that the forebrain is not only the organ of mind and that by which sensory messages reach con sciousness, but also the origin of nervous impulses, or as he, following his predecessors, wrote, of " animal spirits," which when distributed to lower levels of the nervous system excite movement. He compared these nervous discharges to explosions of gunpowder, and attributed epilepsy to excessive and irregular explosions which in predisposed persons spread through the nervous system. He also taught that epileptogenous discharges originate in grey matter-not in the meninges, white matter, or ventricles of the brain, as was previously believed. But even Willis did not escape the weight of tradition, for he wrote: "As often as the Devil is permitted to affect miserable mortals he is not able to draw more cruel arrows from any other quiver, or to show miracles by any better witch than by assaults of this monstrous disease." He also described how an attack could be recognized as the work of witches. A generation later Boerhaave, the celebrated Dutch physician, attempted to explain the symptoms of epilepsy and of other diseases in terms of the physiology of his time. He recognized that many causes may precipitate an attack in one predisposed to epilepsy, and emphasized the importance of injury of the head and neck at birth as a factor. In his view the essential cause of seizures was excessive irritation or abnormal irritability of the brain. At first he believed that the epileptic discharge starts in the white matter of the forebrain, but later decided it may originate in the medulla oblongata. Boerhaave also dis tinguished hysterical and simulated convulsions from epilepsy, and described an interesting outbreak of mass hysteria in an orphanage which he suppressed by applying. or threatening to apply, a red-hot iron to each of the patients. But even Boer haave was not wholly free from the influence of tradition, for he appeared doubtful if it was safe to exclude the possibility of supernatural causes in all cases. During the next century little was added to the knowledge of epilepsy-in fact, a series of experiments on animals diverted attention from the conclusions to which Willis had come. Haller and others.found the cortex of animals inexcitable. but evoked convulsions from the brainstem, particularly from the medulla oblongata, which suggested that this was probably the seat of origin of epilepsy. Even in 1859 Schroeder van der Kalk stated that fits are due to abnormal excitability of the medulla a view shared later by Kussmaul and Russell Reynolds. Noth nagel also postulated the existence of a convulsive centre in the pons, and even Hughlings Jackson believed, for a time at least, that some convulsions depend on discharging centres in the pons or medulla. It is not surprising that even when it was recognized that epilepsy was a cerebral disorder most of the hypotheses on the immediately exciting cause of an attack were indefinite and vague. The Hippocratic school, as we have seen, believed they were due to excessive and viscid humour acting on the brain; others explained them by obstruction to the circulation of a vital humour in the heart or brain : later, chemical substances and peripheral irritation were evoked as probable factors. Henle attributed seizures to disturbances in the cerebral circulation. Kussmaul and others to spasm of the cerebral vessels-a view that later was repeatedly revived. It will be observed that all these theories sought to explain seizures by extraneural factors; Willis alone placed the essential abnormality in the nervous elements of the cortex of the forebrain. Treatment and measures to prevent the occurrence of seizures which were till this time commonly practised both by the people and by doctors illustrate the prevalent ignorance and uncertainty on the nature of the disease. Hippocrates recom mended strict dieting, fasting, purgation, counter-irritation of the head, and sometimes blood-letting. When it was believed they were due to the powers of darkness, prayers, incantations, and charms were the only obvious means of treatment. Charms of great variety were used in many lands: silver rings and rings made from coffin nails were popular in England; carrying three hairs of a milk-white greyhound was recommended in Ireland. But most reliance was placed on religious and mystical rites; even in the middle of the eighteenth century a protest was made at depriving the Church of its privilege of curing fits by holy means. From earliest times various drugs were also em ployed, but none proved so efficient as to be generally used till Sir Charles Locock introduced bromides in 1857. Modem Views on Epilepsy This short review of the history of epilepsy brings us to modern times, when the discovery that the surface of the brain is excitable, and that excessive stimulation of the cortex is liable to prodtice local or general convulsions, provided what is now generally accepted as conclusive evidence that it is here seizures originate. More refined experimental methods and, during the past ten years, the recording of the electrical activity of the brain have confirmed this conclusion. But clinical observation and the scientific application of analysis and reasoning to facts observed had not yet exhausted progress. This was above all owing to Hughlings Jackson, who in a series of papers from 1861 subjected all features of epilepsy to a keen and masterly analysis. Few diseases have been sub jected to such an intensive and critical study, few conclusions have stood so well the test of time as those drawn from it. In a long series of papers Jackson dealt with all its symptoms. discussed their nature, and related them to disorders of specific functions of the brain. Jackson's name is most commonly associated with local convulsions, which, being the simplest subject for study, naturally attracted his attention ; but this is only a minor contribution to his fame. Particularly significant now is his statement that a convulsion is due to " a sudden and excessive discharge of many nervous arrangements representing movements, at once or nearly together, because the cells of these arrangements have by some pathological process become highly unstable." This was indeed a prophetic forecast of the results of later methods of investigation. Another eminent English physician, Sir William Gowers. whose clinical studies and vivid descriptions of the phenomena of epilepsy are unsurpassed, came to a somewha,t similar con clusion. According to him an epileptic outburst is due to an unstable equilibrium of the brain that depends on the molecular constitution of nervous elements, which are there fore predisposed to sudden releases of energy apart from an adequate stimulus. The important part in the teaching of Jackson and Gowers is that the primary and essential disorder lies in the nervous tissue of the cortex, although various other factors may increase their liability to discharge. Later studies have added little to our knowledge. Jackson, Gowers, and others exhausted the limits of clinical observation and analysis, and laboratory in vestigations have served only to demonstrate factors that predispose to seizures in those subject to them. Electro-encephalography But suddenly and unexpectedly, as often happens in other branches of knowledge too, a new means of investigation was discovered which brings us much further in our search into the mystery of epilepsy. In 1929 Hans Berger found that the elec trical activity of the brain can be detected through the unopened skull and scalp and recorded when adequately amplified. This activity, which is now generally known as "brain waves."t</page><page sequence="4">4 JULY 6, 1946 EPILEPSY AND THE EVOLUTION OF CLINICAL MEDICINE MEDICALJOURNAL appears as variations in the action potentials of large groups of neurons which beat together in synchrony, but it is so feeble that to be made visible in tracings it must be magnified one to two million times. These waves may be modified by several factors, as the arrival of afferent impulses, the state of con sciousness, and emotion. Normal waves are more or less regular, but their rate and amplitude vary in different regions of the brain, to some extent in different individuals, and even in the same individual under different conditions. A few years after Berger's discovery it was found that during epileptic seizures the rhythm and voltage of the waves are grossly modified owing to large numbers of neurons discharg ing synchronously or simultaneously. Owing to this grouping of discharges they are larger and slower; it is as though the ripples on a calm sea were suddenly by a gale transformed ,into much larger waves more widely spaced or separated from each other. An epileptic discharge has, indeed, been figuratively described as a " brain storm." .It has also been found that different patterns of irregularity are associated with different types of seizures, and that deviations from the normal may occur in an epileptic in interparoxysmal periods. By many the electro-encephalograph has come to be regarded as a magic wand that can clear away any doubts there may be in the diagnosis of epilepsy. This attitude is certainly un justified, and may unfortunately cause not only an error but also the personal and economic tragedy that wrongly stamping a person as an epileptic may lead to. Let us see what is the position electro-encephalography occupies to-day. In the first place it is no uncommon experience for the physician to find that separate reports on tracings of the brain waves of any individual are widely divergent or even contradictory: one recorder may report the tracings he has obtained as normal, another that they indicate beyond doubt epilepsy, while a third may interpret his tracings as doubtful but sufficient to suggest the possibility of epilepsy and thus excite the fears, anxiety, and uncertainty that are so disturbing to the patient and to his relatives. For here, as in other branches of medicine, the significance of tests that are new, mysterious, or classed as " scientific" outweigh to the layman the value of expert clinical experience. The changes in the electro-encephalographic tracings during and immediately preceding a seizure are characteristic and can leave no doubt of its nature; but often these can be demon strable only when recorded during an attack-then they merely supplement direct observation. Occasionally, however, they appear between seizures and can, then be interpreted as due to larvate attacks that present no outward or visible sign. Such de, iations from the normal are undoubtedly valuable, especially when an attack has been unobserved and when information conveyed by the patient or his friends may leave doubt of their nature. But electro-encephalographic abnormalities of the type associ ated with epilepsy occur even in normal persons who never have had, and probably never will have, a seizure. Lennox, whose experience is unrivalled, estimates that 10% of the population, and an even larger proportion of relatives of epileptics, give such records, and he and others have seen undoubted epileptics in whom abnormal tracings have never been obtained even on repeated examinations. Recently attention has been directed to less characteristic or non-specific abnormalities, which are more common in tracings from epileptics than from normal persons, but they are not pathognomonic, and indicate at the most only an epileptic ten dency. Their value in diagnosis is also reduced by the fact that they occur in other conditions, particularly in the psychoses, in psychoneuroses, and after head injuries. Changes in the rhythm of the brain waves as revealed by the electro-encephalograph have not, therefore, the absolute value in diagnosis as has the demonstration of the causal organism of an infectious illness, the Widal test in enteric fever, the estimation of blood sugar in diabetes mellitus, or even electro cardiographic tracings in revealing lesions of the conducting system of the heart. To auote Denis Williams, who has had extensive experience both in the use of electro-encephalography and in clinical neurology: " With expert clinical case-taking the electro-encephalograph is needed as a diagnostic aid in only a minority of patients suspected of having epilepsy"; and *There is an unfortunate tendency among some clinicians to substitute a laboratory report for a careful history and examin ation." Jasper, who has worked extensively on the subject, also writes: " The electro-encephalogram cannot be depended upon to give a certain diagnosis of clinical epilepsy without the aid of other data." Future experience, research, and the adoption of new methods may add to the value of recording the electrical activity of the brain in epilepsy, but to-day we can only regard it as ancillary or supplementary to clinical investigation and experience. It may, however, produce evidence of what Lennox has called "dysrhythmia " of the cortex-a state that can be regarded as the essential basis of epilepsy, though the patient is not subject to fits or other epileptic symptoms. It also frequently serves to identify the site of pathological changes in the forebrain, whether associated with epileptic phenomena or not, and it has thrown light on the nature of the epileptic discharge. Electro encephalography has done little more than confirm the hypo thesis of the cause of epileptic convulsions formulated as a result of his clinical studies by Hughlings Jackson more than 70 years ago, but it has made possible the visible recording of these excessive discharges. Conclusion Here our short sketch of the long history of epilepsy must end. To-morrow may throw new light on the abnormalities of function that constitute liability to seizures and may perhaps bring new therapeutic measures for controlling this liability; but we can now inquire what light this history throws on the evolution of clinical knowledge, for, unless it conveys to us lessons from the past for the use of the present and the future, ho matter how interesting history may be it remains barren. It is obvious that the first step must be differentiation of each disease by clinical methods which mark out the features that distinguish it and make it possible to define it as a clinical entity. The next step is determination of the organ disorder of which is responsible for the appearance of these clinical symptoms. Then comes recognition of the manner in which the functions of this organ are disordered, whether they are associated or not with structural disease-in other words, the interpretation of symptoms in terms of physiology. But in many pathological- conditions clinical investigation alone cannot suc ceed in unravelling all the problems of disease; it must call on the assistance of laboratory and other ancillary methods that may throw light on the nature of the disorder and on the aetiological factors responsible for it. Finally, the history of epilepsy emphasizes the importance of adequate clinical study of each disease, no matter how valu able laboratory methods may be, in order to make possible the synthesis and integration of information obtained from all sources and its relation to the patient as a whole; for no patient must ever be looked upon as a conglomerate of many more or less independent parts, but as a living adaptable individual. The history of epilepsy is particularly valuable for the student-and most of us remain students, though perhaps less objective and less receptive to new ideas as age advances-as it shows that one of the most potent obstacles to the advance of knowledge is reliance on authority and subordination to it of accurate observation and careful analysis in terms of function of thb facts observed. The Canadian Tuberculosis Association in its Bulletin for March April, 1946, says that two of the great stumbling-blocks to effective control of tuberculosis have been lack of sanatorium beds and unsatisfactory arrangements to defray the cost of treatment. Steps have been taken during the past few years towards solving both problems. If present plans go through 3,000 additional treatment beds are likely to be available this year. Four provinces have already instituted free treatment for all their tuberculous sick. These are Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba, and New Brunswick. Nova Scotia and Quebec have announced their intention to make similar arrange ments at an early date. Meanwhile the educational programme has been intensified. Surveys have stimulated public interest, and these have provided valuable object-lessons in how much unsuspected tuberculosis there is likely to be in the general population. Another encouraging feature is the growing public interest in rehabilitation. During 1944 Canada's death rate from tuberculosis fell to the lowest point in history, namely, 47.7 per 100,000 of the population. Preliminary reports indicate a further reduction last year.</page></plain_text>
