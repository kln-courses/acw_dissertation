"I can't keep up with the literature" is a lament heard regularly these days. Fortunately, some bibliophiles find the time and patience to provide us with syntheses of the literature in areas of ac- tive research. Sadleir's book is a superb summary of research concerned with the ecology of mam- malian reproduction. He has skillfully summarized our knowledge of the effects of environmental fac- tors, both physical and biotic, upon puberty, the breeding season, pregnancy, parturition, lactation, and post-natal survival of both domestic and wild mammalian species. A brief discussion of the role of man in the ecology of breeding animals con- cludes the book. Sadleir cautiously accepts Spencer's and Stein- hoff's hypothesis regarding the relationship of litter size to altitude and latitude. He cites Hoffman's report, now 11 years old, of the positive correla- tion between the crude protein content of grasses and the litter size of certain microtines, a finding worthy of further investigation. A similar distillation of the literature for other vertebrate groups, birds for example, would be welcome. Hopefully someone, perhaps Sadleir, will find the time and patience for such an under- taking.-DONALD R. JOHNSON, Department of Bio- logical Science, University of Idaho, Moscow. Ecology and Behaviour of the Black Rhinoc- eros (Diceros bicornis L.). A Field Study. By R. Schenkel and L. Schenkel-Hullinger. Mam- malia depicta, 1969. Paul Parey, Hamburg and Berlin. 100pp. DM28,-. The Schenkels have produced a publication on the black rhinoceros which will be of considerable interest to wildlife workers, and all those inter- ested in conservation and natural history. Their report is based on a short field study of the rhinoceros population in a small area of Tsavo National Park in Kenya. Tsavo is considered as one of the last strongholds of distribution of the black rhinoceros; parts of the park are undergoing progressive ecological change from Commiphora woodland to bush grassland and open grassland. The change has been initiated by tremendous de- struction of the woodland by elephant, and is ag- gravated by fire. The question is posed whether or not the black rhinoceros can survive this trans- formation of its habitat. The text is divided into two major sections: (1) Ecology, (2) Sociology and Behavior. It con- cludes with a short summary. The major section 662 on ecology includes five general sub-sections, dealing with the habitat of the mammal in part of Tsavo, including a list of plants eaten by rhinoceros, and the relationship between the rhi- noceros and other vertebrate species. Sub-sections on parasites and diseases, aggressions and intra- specific intolerance, and biological characters of the population of a selected area, are also included. The major section on behavior deals in part with diurnal activity patterns, group structure, re- actions to other vertebrates, ritualized and non- ritualized behavior patterns, mating behavior, and a description of the bond between mother and calf. This section is supported with meticulous descrip- tions and extensive documentation of certain aspects of behavior. Descriptions in general are excellent, but are sometimes anthropomorphic, for example, the interpretation of reactions of the black rhinoceros to man in a car. Parts of the publication tend toward generaliza- tions, based on very little or no quantitative data, but this is perhaps inevitable in a field study of this kind. The authors state categorically that the black rhinoceros do not live in territories, are no- madic to a large degree within the study area, and that the population of Tsavo East is approximately 1,000 individuals. Unfortunately, none of these statements are supported with precise quantitative data. In spite of this criticism, the text is packed with interesting and useful observations of the black rhinoceros. The critical question, posed in the foreword, and referred to in the summary, that is, whether the black rhinoceros will survive in the changing environment, is still a subject of debate. In the summary, the authors suggest that it may be "the task of man as a conservationist to actively maintain a certain natural equilibrium within the wildlife sanctuaries."-JoHN GODDARD, 417 N.

Academic Press, Inc., New York. 1968. xix,429pp. $19.50. This volume covers the proceedings of a sym- posium held at the Zoological Society of London on November 10-11, 1966. Thirty-five contributors and sixteen discussants took part and together with the editor and three session chairmen they have produced a worthwhile contribution to the fund of knowledge on the nutrition of wildlife. The material, presented as separate papers, covers a diverse array of topics ranging from diets of laboratory primates and nutrition of zoo animals to a report on wild reindeer in Norway, ptarmigan</page></plain_text>
