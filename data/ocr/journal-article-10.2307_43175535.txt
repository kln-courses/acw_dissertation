In this month's col- umn, popcorn takes center stage as students engage in investigations relating to observations and predictions, as well as conducting an experiment about the differ- ence between white and yellow kernels of popcorn.

Synopsis This classic story introduces students to the history of popcorn and offers interesting facts, stories, and legends associated with the snack food. • Illustrated by Brian Lie* PopCOrīl ^ f By Elaine Landau, y V- * Charlesbridge. 2003. ^ ^ ISBN 1570914435. ÉjiljPj Éjí Synopsis H II This nonfiction book uses fun and colorful images and a clever way to present information on the topic of popcorn (i.e. , sidebars featuring a curious raccoon who loves popcorn occur throughout the book) . It is full of accurate details and interesting trivia, covering the history of popcorn and the science of how popcorn pops. Teachers should feel comfortable with the content presented and can address the books anthropomorphism by discussing the humanlike characteristics that the raccoon exhibits (e.g., loving popcorn among others) . Curricular Connections The activities that follow use this popular snack food as a way to investigate several science-process skills - obser- vation, prediction, comparison, and experimentation. In The Popcorn Book, younger students (grades K-3) are provided with some general information about the histo- ry and types of popcorn as one of the characters describes the process for making popcorn. The illustrations and information in this book can help the students begin to think about making observations about popcorn - both popped and unpopped - which directly connects to the "abilities necessary to do scientific inquiry" as well as the ability to "employ simple equipment and tools to gather data and extend the senses" (NRC 1996, p. 122). The second activity (for students in grades 4-6) ad- dresses some of the challenges that upper elementary students can face when "identifying variables or con- trolling more than one variable in an experiment" (NRC 1996, p. 143) . In this experience, students manipulate a single variable as well as collect and record data to an- swer the teacher-generated question (and thus engage in primary inquiry) .

Materials: popcorn (both unpopped kernels and popped kernels) ; white paper, paper cups, small hand- held magnifying lenses; hot-air popcorn popper Procedure: 1 . Engage students by asking if they have ever eaten popcorn. Most students probably have tried this traditional treat at either the movies or a sporting event. Continue to have the students share their knowledge about popcorn by following up with "where does popcorn come from?" 2. Share The Popcorn Book with the class. One charac- ter in the story is "researching" information about popcorn while another character is going through the process of making popcorn using a stove-top method. Throughout the story, make text-to-self connections by stopping at the key spots to ask the students if they would try popcorn thrown into a fire or popcorn soup or popcorn with cream for breakfast. All of these different groups of people in the story experimented with popcorn. 3 . Explain to students that they are going to investigate popcorn, which is in fact a seed. Begin by providing each student a hand lens, a sheet of white paper to place the kernels on, and a small paper cup with un- popped popcorn kernels (different types of kernels if possible) and popped kernels. Have the students individually examine the popped and unpopped kernels and make as many observations as possible: size, shape, smell, and color. The students can ei- ther illustrate or write their observations in a science notebook, or a table can be designed by the teacher to help students to track their information. * -Jutāt n * * f; * 4. As a class, discuss the observations to generate a larger list. Using this information, present the following question, "If we were to observe pop- corn popping, what do you think we would see?" Answers often vary from "the bag getting bigger" (microwave popcorn) to "popcorn pieces jumping out of a pan" (the traditional method). 5 . Explain to students that they will be observing the teacher popping corn using an air popper /'' to make some additional observations. A hot- caution air popcorn popper is the safest way to do this as a demonstration. Using an oil-based popper on a stove top is not recommended.) 6. Before popping the corn, have students make class predictions about popcorn: "Do you think all the seeds (kernels) will pop, why or why not?" and "What color will the popcorn kernel be when it pops?" Most students have seen unpopped kernels at the bottom of the popcorn bowl, so they predict that they will not all pop. The leading belief of why some popcorn doesn't pop is that there is not enough moisture in the kernel to cause heating and expansion. However, students' reasoning as to why is a bit fuzzier. Some students may suggest there wasn't enough room in the bag or that the kernels were old or "not good." 7. As you start to pop the popcorn, encourage stu- dents to make observations about what they are see- ing (the shape of the kernels) ; what they are hearing (the popping noise) ; and what they are smelling. 8 . Have the students return to their list of predictions to discuss their findings. Usually not all popcorn kernels pop. Also, students can see the change in the volume size from unpopped kernels to popped kernels. By returning to predictions, as well as considering their observations, students are engaging in and develop- ing their science-process skills. When all the observing and predicting is done with your students, there is only one thing left to do - provided none of your students are allergic - kick back and enjoy that freshly popped popcorn! * ^ * j &amp;</page><page sequence="3">Jfeadiiiiij^hröqgh Trade books* For Grades 4-6: Comparing Kernels Purpose: To have students manipulate a single variable in an investigation Materials: yellow popcorn kernels; white popcorn kernels, hot-air popper, tablespoon, measuring cup Procedure: The book Popcorn! introduces the variables associated with producing a satisfying bag of popcorn. One variable that can be investigated relates to the color of the popcorn kernel. Popcorn comes in two natural colors, white and yellow, which are determined by the color of the endosperm (one of the three main parts of a corn kernel). White popcorn was the first to be produced in large quantity, but today almost all popcorn sold is yellow because it produces larger kernels that taste better. Popcorn sold in the grocery store is usually yellow popcorn. White popcorn is labeled as such and can be found online { www.snappypopcorn.com ). 1. Have students compare and contrast the two different types of kernels and record their observations on a data sheet. Students should use quantitative measurements where possible to describe the size of each kernel. Students will note a minor size difference between the two types of kernels, with white kernels being smaller. 2. After students have examined the unpopped kernels, have each group measure one tablespoon of each kernel type and count the number of kernels in each sample. Record that data on their data sheet as well. Once they have counted the number of kernels, have them make predictions about possible similarities and differences of the soon-to-be-popped corn. 3. Using a hot-air popper (which is also a controlled variable in this study), pop the sample of the yellow kernels. Measure the volume of the popped kernels using a measuring cup and then determine how many kernels did not pop and record the information. 4. Repeat step three with the white kernels, recording the same type of information. Students should record additional observations to compare and contrast the two types of popped kernels (both will appear white, a factor associated with the starch). Students might notice there are two different popcorn shapes - the butterfly (the airy, lighter popped pieces) and the mushroom (more rounded in shape). This has nothing to do with the type of kernel used, one single ear of corn - white or yellow kernels - can produce both shapes of popped kernels. (Two factors that can affect the shape of the kernel are growing conditions and popping environment.) 5 . Now have students use the evidence that they gathered to answer the following questions: "How were the two differenttypes ofpopcornthe same? Different?" "Which of the types of popcorn produced the largest pieces of popped corn?" "Which type of popcorn took up more room or volume?" (Both types of popcorn can produce both shapes of a popped kernel, and yellow popcorn produces the larger size piece of popcorn, which takes up more room, or volume, when popped.) Extend learning by controlling other variables in popcorn experiments, such as typeofpopper, the amount ofpopcom popped at one time, or different brands of popcorn.
