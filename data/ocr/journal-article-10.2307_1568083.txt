Part One.# Ancestors of the Sylphide in the Conte Fantastique Joellen A. Meglin I think of performing this research on the ballet fantastique as something like holding a seance: I press the spirits of the past to come to life, to appear before us as they really were, to speak to us. I want to communicate with the dead, but it is definitely an act for the living. It is a moment of retrospective reckoning: a relay of curative ideas from the vantage point of the present. I am primed as the medium, steeped in occult Romantic literature. You, the readers, are my guests sitting around the table, perhaps curious, critical, skeptical. I use the metaphor of the seance for this particular research study not only because it was a cultural practice of the period I am studying, and because I have come to believe that Romanticism itself was a kind of cultural communing with the spirits of the past by people left with its residue in the present, but also because writing this history seems to #Editors' Note: Parts Two and Three will appear in Volume 27, Number 3 and Volume 28, Number 1. 67 DOI: 10.1081 /DNC- 120029927 ? 2004 by Joellen A.

I place the relics-in this case, texts-on the table. I try to get my incantations just right, the words to carry an era. Then apparitions seem to take shape out of the strange, dark shadows and flickering light around me. Uncovering the meanings and sensuous dimensionsa of the French ballet fantastique involves getting in touch with particular sensibilities as they emerged out of specific cultural circumstances. It is an imaginative act that strives to be true to the spirit of persons, places, and things, to what may be called the aura (invisible breath or emanation) of the times. While my account will be revisionist, using the theories of the present time to probe the past, nevertheless it will be grounded in key pre- Romantic and Romantic texts as I explore the unholy marriage of fantasy and phantasm that was to spawn the fantastic ballet. The methods I use to reconstruct meanings have been governed to some extent by the historical traces to which I have had access. As an American woman studying the French ballet from a distance of time and place, I have found literary sources-readily available in the United States-illuminating as I decipher the particular meanings a ballet might have had for the audiences of its day. My first incursion into this method involved a comparison of Jean Coralli's libretto for Le Diable Boiteux (1836) with Alain-Rene Lesage's 1707 original novel of the same title, often translated into English as The Devil on Two Sticks.[~' A later study included comparisons between source novels and the ballets they inspired with regard to Native Americans: Chateaubriand's Atala (1801) with Louis Henry's Les Sauvages de la Floride (1807) and James Fenimore Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans (1826) with Leon Halevy's Les Mohicans (1837).[2] Indeed, the first half of the nineteenth century seems to have had a particular fascination with the way narrative structures might be represented in dance. Marian Smith has shown how musical motifs in Romantic ballet scores mimicked knocks on doors, hunting horns, even the rhythms and inflections-the rhetorical structures-of speech.[31 Ivor Guest has pointed out that it was in this period that scenarists (often professional writers) first became co-authors of ballet scenarios; before this time, the choreographers themselves had devised the aCynthia Jean Cohen Bull establishes the importance of considering the sensuous dimensions of dance in the analysis of cultural meanings in "Sense, Meaning, and Perception in Three Dance Cultures," in Meaning in Motion: New Cultural Studies of Dance, ed.

The librettos themselves, notably Giselle, can wax poetic in the use of language. They are filled with actual lines of dialogue as well as cues for pantomime and acting virtuosity. Moreover, they were sold in the theatres; synopses of the stories were reproduced in theatre journals, notably Album des Theitres;c and they were retold, embellished with beautiful and elaborate engravings, in commemorative books like Les Beautes de l'Opera, written by Theophile Gautier, Jules Janin, and Philarite Chasles.[51 All of this should suggest a close proximity between the literary world and the ballet world, and indeed, I suggest, crossover is evident, not only through the doubling of roles-Romantic literati writing and publishing as dance critics (and in Gautier's case, as a librettist) and vice versa-but also through the use of symbols that may be found to permeate both mediums. Moreover, the symbols seem to gesture to, refer to, and point to each other, suggesting that apprehending their significance relied upon the consumer's immersion in diverse cultural genres that transcended any one medium. At least, I have discovered such a set of correspondences between a particular genre of storytelling very bGuest names the ballet La Somnambule (1827), written anonymously by the dramatist Eugene Scribe, as the first occurrence of this in Paris. Ivor Guest, The Romantic Ballet in Paris (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1966), pp. 7-8. August Bournonville, in a letter to his wife, Helena Fredrika, from Paris, dated April 20, 1841, criticized this trend in which "they do not even ask balletmasters themselves to invent their subjects but, instead, force them to stage the ideas of [professional] librettists--indeed, will not even read their scenarios.... Add to this that these librettists (may Heaven turn its back on them and the world forget their scenarios) have a dominant say in the casting of roles and the choice of the music composer; consequently, all the balletmaster is actually responsible for is the general scenic arrangement."

The basic idea, whose origin is attributed to Julia Kristeva, is that texts refer to and derive their meaning, at least in part, from their relationships with other texts.[6] In literary studies, intertextuality is believed to pertain across mediums, so that one might juxtapose ballets with, say, novels and folklore. Comparative literature has expanded theory into established practice with the creation of a new journal, dTo an overstatement of the importance of the fantastic ballet, one could reasonably object that this germinating seed of the ballet blanc was not a dominant trend of the Romantic ballet in France. Instead, ballets of local color, historical embellishment, and exotic fantasy were the rule: Le Revolte au Sdrail (1833) set in Granada, Le Diable Boiteux (1836), set in Madrid, La Tarentule (1839) set in Calabria, Brezilia, ou la Tribu des Femmes (1835), Les Mohicans (1837), and La Volidre, ou les Oiseaux de Boccace (1838), set in the Americas, and La Chatte Mdtamorphosee en Femme (1837), set in China. Even La Sylphide (1832) was set in folkloric Scotland and Giselle (1841) in enchanted German forests. Nevertheless, these latter two ballets, as I will attempt to show in this study, were not only profoundly influenced by the discourse of the fantastic, but they also had a crucial impact on ballet history, at least as judged by the number of performances they received in the period, their longevity in the repertoire, and their eventual entry into the canon. In addition, La Peri (1843), the only other Romantic ballet besides Giselle to be subtitled ballet fantastique (most being subtitled ballet-pantomine or simply ballet, and several ballet-faery), reflected Gautier's particular usages in the fantastic genre. See Ivor Guest, The Romantic Ballet in Paris (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1966), pp. 268-9. Several ballets contained supernatural elements but are more accurately characterized as merveilles (marvels) or akin to the fairy tale, for example, La Tempete, ou l'Ile des Ginies (1834) and La Fille du Danube (1836). Others capitalized on the popularity of the devil in name or in spirit, but again, were more magical than fantastic: Le Diable Boiteux (1836), Le Diable Amoureux (1840), and Le Diable a Quatre (1845). Still others interwove dream and somnambulism into the narrative: La Jolie Fille de Gand (1842) and Eucharis (1844). The ballet des Nonnes from the opera Robert le Diable (1831) might just as easily be compared to Gothic literature as to fantastic literature; however, it is arguably the first ballet blanc and the harbinger of the ballet fantastique. Here I limit the discussion to fantastic ballets produced in France in the decade spanning the years 1831 and 1841.</page><page sequence="5">Behind the Veil of Translucence 71 Intertexts,[7] which has a decided interdisciplinary thrust. Intuitively, we experience a cultural milieu in a particular time and place as a kind of tapestry, not the unwoven separate strands of dance studies, literary studies, art history, and so forth. Dance history studies plunged itself into these new theoretical currents with the inclusion of a panel on applications of intertextuality to dance research in the 1999 conference of the Society of Dance History Scholars.[81 Speaking on this panel, the dance historian Lena Hammergren made an important distinction between "intertext" and "context": wherever a text is perceived as a case of a "culturally coded [genre]" it may be considered as an intertext, rather than merely "contextual surroundings to the objects of investigation."[9] Indeed, the very recognition in 1829-30 of a distinct genre of the fantastic validates its intertextual study.e In addition, not just the importation of particular signs and symbols from the conte to the ballet and the ballet to the conte justifies the juxtaposed study of the two, but the subtitle of the ballet that has come to be considered the apogee of ballet Romanticism, Giselle, as "Ballet fantastique"'10] seems to beg for an intertextual investigation. This theoretical perspective determines the relevant materials for my study, which are chiefly literary texts, contes fantastiques and ballet librettos. The ballets to be studied alongside the contes are the ballet des Nonnes, choreographed by Filippo Taglioni for Giacomo Meyerbeer's opera Robert le Diable (November 21, 1831), La Sylphide (March 12, 1832), also choreographed by Taglioni, and Giselle, ou les Wilis (June 28, 1841), choreographed by Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot. Copies of the original librettos have been obtained from the Bibliotheque de l'Opera in Paris or the Dance Division of the New York Public Library. With regard to the contes fantastiques, some are still well known, others long forgotten. The length alone of the list of selected stories gives a glimpse of the popularity of the genre, which found its way into short stories and novelettes: Jacques Cazotte's Le Diable Amoureux (The Devil in Love, 1772); Charles Nodier's Smarra, ou les Demons de la Nuit (Smarra, or the Demons of the Night, 1821), Trilby, ou le Lutin d'Argail eln 1829 Jean-Jacques Ampere translated E. T. A. Hoffmann's Fantasiestuicke in Callot's Manner into French, coining the word fantastique for the genre in the process. The following year saw the publication of essays by Charles Nodier and Gerard de Nerval on the subject of thefantastique in literature. In the early 1830s the ability to relate a fantastic tale became almost the sine qua non of literary arrival. See Ora Avni, "Fantastic Tales," in A New History of French Literature, ed. Denis Hollier (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1994), pp. 675-6.</page><page sequence="6">72 Meglin (Trilby, or the Imp of Argyle, 1822), and Ines de las Sierras (Inez of the Sierras, 1837); Honor6 de Balzac's La Peau de Chagrin (The Fatal Skin, 1831), "Une Conversation entre onze heures et minuit" (A Conversation between Eleven O'Clock and Midnight, 1831), and "Le Grand d'Espagne" (The Spanish Grandee, 1832); Philarete Chasles' "L'Oeil sans Paupiere" (The Eye Without an Eyelid, 1831), "Les Trois Soeurs" (The Three Sisters, 1832), and "Une Bonne Fortune" (A Good Fortune, 1832); Charles Rabou's "Le Ministere Public" (The Public Minister, 1832) and "Sara la Danseuse" (Sara the Dancer, 1832); Prosper Merimee's La Venus d'Ille (The Venus of Ille, 1837); and Theophile Gautier's "La Cafetiere" (The Coffee Pot, 1831), "Omphale, Histoire Rococo" (Omphale, Rococo Story, 1834), and La Morte Amoureuse (The Dead Woman in Love, 1836). Some conteurs, like Charles Nodier, were specifically known for being masters of the fantastic; others, like Balzac, whose natural temperament leaned toward the realistic, perhaps felt obliged by the times to engage in the genre. But in any case, the fantastic tale seemed to reach a peak of popularity in France in the 1830s. (Gautier slyly comments on the ubiquity of the genre in the opening of "Omphale," when his protagonist reflects that if his uncle had known his nephew was taking up the profession of conteurfantastique, he would have disowned him; the young man then proceeds to relate his fantastic experience with the usual appeals to the reader's good faith.)["] Although foreign influences-German, Scottish, English, even American- abounded, this study is limited to fantastic tales in the French language, presumably those with the most direct influence on the ballet. As a dance scholar, I have contented myself with reading modern republications and reprints of these stories, sometimes even in English translation, although frequently I have located an original publication in the Annenberg Rare Book and Manuscript Library of the University of Pennsylvania, the Pierpont Morgan Library, or the New York Public Library, in order to hold the book in my hand, to discover publication information, and to collect photocopies of original engravings. For accompanying the stories, their narrative structures, imagery, and par- ticular usages of language, is an iconography that plots out the discourse in another dimension. Moreover, it is possible to compare these visual representations with those of the ballets documented in sketches and watercolors of costume designs, in painted reproductions of scenes, and most especially in engravings that decorated commemorative albums and books. In this welter of source material that spans mediums, I search for recurring motifs, themes, packets of meaning, particular usages, conventions, cross-references, and reassembled composite images in visual, verbal, and aural dimensions (and I infer a kinesthetic dimension)</page><page sequence="7">Behind the Veil of Translucence 73 that emerge to signify a style or an aesthetic taste for, or a cultural practice of, the fantastic. My purpose is to illuminate the ballets, how they were intended by their authors and collaborators and experienced by contemporary audiences-in other words, to explore the meanings with which they were imbued. In the process of my exegesis I borrow several premises from intertextual theory. First, identifying an intertextual space, or a ground for comparative analysis between two texts, does not imply that either is a source text for the other.[12] Instead, the researcher is searching for a discourse, common threads or contours of conversation that signal particular patterns in the spread or dissemination of information.[31] Thus, intertextual study prefers semiotic strategies of analysis and explication of texts to historical documentation of sequences of events, authorship, oral testimony, and so forth. Second, as Janet Adshead- Lansdale reminds the researcher, even the selection of texts to juxtapose in intertextual study is an act of interpretation, and one that extrapolates from the researcher's historical position.[141 Third, intertextual study is equally about identifying the departures and deviations from established conventions and about locating the replications of them. In other words, embedded within intertextual structures are possibilities for change, transformation, invention, and new paradigms.1'51 The value of intertextual study is that it generates insights across mediums, crosses artificial boundaries, and penetrates complex cultural phenomena. The first premise is played out in the following manner in the context of this study: I explore the circle of perception-the similarities of language and image among short stories, novels, engravings, ballet librettos and reviews, costume designs, memorabilia, and so forth, all of which contributed to a milieu, a mentality, a discourse of the fantastic. The emphasis will be upon close reading and comparison of texts, with evidence emerging in the form of language and visual motifs. Hence, my argument involves inferring a circuit, so to speak, of currents, cross- currents, and recurrent energy, rather than claiming a chain of direct influences. My selection of contes has hinged partly on fortuitous finds, partly on systematic scholarly search, and partly on penchant. I first read about the conte fantastique in Thomas A. Kselman's Death and the Afterlife in Modern France.[16] Then, after discovering a collection of fantastic tales by Theophile Gautier in a Parisian bookstore one summer, I became hooked.J171 Many authors have made distinctions between the conte fantastique and the conte merveilleux (story of marvels) or conte de fe (fairy tale), which may be summarized as follows: the fantastic presents an inexplicable rupture with reality, while the marvelous or fairylike</page><page sequence="8">74 Meglin creates a parallel, enchanted world, which does not, however, contest the real world.f For the purposes of this study, while I adhere to this distinction, I broaden the category of conte fantastique to include what might more strictly speaking be referred to as the conte brun (dark or twilight tale), the genre frne'tique (of frenzy or madness), and even the melodrame, all of which reached a particular peak of production in the 1820s and 1830s in France. My scholarly rationale for embracing such a breadth of Gothic styles lies in my belief that, as audiences and scholars of the Romantic ballet, we have lost the true sense of the gruesome, the grisly, the bizarre, the terrifying, the demented, the violent, and the dark side of man that whetted the palates of cultural taste then. Here is where I extrapolate from a historical position, acknowledging the researcher's (i.e., my own) intersection with the research, for I consider myself an advocate and activist for women against violence against women. In many of these tales women emerge as vehicles of violence, whether as perpetrators or victims; in other words, violence centers on women. Graphic and metaphoric, these tales contain images of woman as succubus, Satan, vampire. Women are raped, dismembered, clubbed, or set afire; they are brutally punished and they suffer horribly. They also die one after another, through diseases that make them lovelier and more desirable than ever. A few years ago I stumbled across a newspaper article about the escalating taste for violence and pornography in a society in collapse in Belgrade, Serbia.J81 In one of those startling moments when the historian sees a parallel between the past and the present, I wondered if the post- fRoger Caillois asserts "the feerique is a marvelous universe that opposes itself to the real world without destroying the coherence of the latter"; "the fantastique, to the contrary, manifests a scandal, a fissure, an unexpected, almost unbearable, encroachment upon the real world" ("Le f6erique est un univers merveilleux qui s'oppose au monde reel sans en detruire la coherence"; "le fantastique, au contraire, manifest un scandale, une dechirure, une irruption insolite, presque insupportable, dans le monde reel"). Quoted in Peter Whyte, Theophile Gautier, Conteur Fantastique et Merveilleux, Durham Modern Language Series (Durham, [UK]: University of Durham, 1996), p. 1. In 1836 Gautier himself made a similar distinction in an essay on Hoffmann's tales, which greeted a new translation by Henry Egmont: "the marvelous of Hoffmann is not the marvelous of fairy tales; it retains a foot in the real world" ("le merveilleux d'Hoffmann n'est pas le merveilleux des contes de f6es; il a toujours un pied dans le monde reel"). Theophile Gautier, "Contes d'Hoffmann," in La Morte Amoureuse, Avatar et Autres Recits Fantastiques, ed. Jean Gaudon (n.p.: Gallimard, 1981), pp. 447, 459. Unless otherwise noted, all translations are my own.</page><page sequence="9">Behind the Veil of Translucence 75 Revolutionary and Napoleonic wartime periods had not witnessed an escalated taste for violence, a restructuring of desire, a shift toward stimulation via images of sexuality melded with brutality, cruelty, torture, and death. I am very concerned about implicit messages of violence toward women in the cultural products of my own society. Thus, my particular research bents and feminist consciousness allow particular themes to stand out in the context of this research. Dance history has of late become increasingly self-aware. Questions of historiography-how dance historians "perform" history in searching for documentary or oral evidence, interpreting meaning, and writing narratives-have come to the fore. What constitutes valid historical traces of dance history and what is the historian's role in parsing the evidence and piecing it together to create a coherent picture? Researchers have self-consciously articulated their processes in performing research, taking to task unexamined assumptions, introspectively analyzing their presence in the research, and building epistemological bridges even as they describe their findings.[19] The model that emerges is a three-dimensional one: the first plane is the historian's creation of a picture of the period or phenomenon under study; the second, a deciphering of the various textual references used to construct the research; and the third, a critical inquiry of the process of performing dance history itself, a kind of watching oneself in the act. Thus, I have aimed for transparency in the construction of my research narrative, particularly with regard to how impressions have intersected with my own cultural and historical position. The third premise I borrow from intertextual theory is that studying cross-referents and gestures between texts (assuming that all texts do indeed respond to other texts) can reveal change and transformation, conventions interrupted, thought rerouted. I argue that the Romantic ballet was just such a turning point, when the fantastique flourished but was feminized, made sentient, imbued with forgiveness and compassion. Hence, the ballet did not merely mimic the elements and essential meanings of the contes fantastiques; it necessarily transformed them as new players-female superstar performers--were introduced into the scene and as the live female body became the vehicle for elaboration of the fantastic. Jacques Cazotte's Amorous Devil and the Sylphide Jacques Cazotte's Le Diable Amoureux (The Devil in Love), first published in 1772, is generally considered the precursor of the</page><page sequence="10">76 Meglin nineteenth-century conte fantastique.120] Four defining characteristics can be abstracted from the scholarly discourse on Cazotte's odd tale, which remains the quintessential example of the genre.[21] First, the author blurs the boundary between reality and fantasy by juxtaposing realistic, precisely detailed description with the recounting of unreal, bizarre events. Second, the resulting rupture of reality actually reveals a deeper reality as darkness, damage, and evil intrude on a daily life that would apparently seem free of such things. Third, a psychological dimension infuses the narrative via dreams, the inner confusion of the main character, extreme subjectivity, and doubt about whether all that is recounted is just the outer projection of an inner landscape. Fourth, one character seems to mirror another or respond so closely to his thoughts as to be a double, a part or counterpart of him-a doppelginger." In this section I hope to show that these were precisely the narrative devices to which La Sylphide gave theatrical and kinesthetic expression. Later, I proceed to the germinating seed of realism pushing its way to the surface; how the apparent rupture of reality inherent in the fantastic actually heaved up the shadowy side of humankind. One must reckon with the psychological verisimilitude in the streams of conscious- ness, the guilt, and the terror; one must take account of the inherent violence. What could be older than a tale of temptation by the devil? But what is different about Cazotte's devil, Biondetta, is the gender ambiguity gAndrew J. Webber has analyzed the doppelgdinger figure in nineteenth-century German literature in the context of competing trends toward realism and fantasy, and as a symptom of "subjectivity in crisis." Several of his premises, necessarily condensed here, seem relevant to this study: (1) that the doppelghnger is "a figure of visual compulsion" and a means of seeing self; (2) that it performs identity, rehearsing existential alternatives; (3) that through it the subject experiences "an ambivalent sexual agency"; (4) that it "appears out of place [in time and space], in order to displace its host"; (5) that it returns, repeats, and reinvents itself rhetorically, and compulsively. Webber reads the doppelgdinger as a historical/ antihistorical figure in the sense that it both represents the past and, like a revenant, conflates the past with the present, resisting the passage of time. Furthermore, he proposes that the doppelgdinger is not only a repressed personal other, but also a repressed historical other, "so often under- or unwritten ... in standard literary history." The similarities between the doppelgSinger and the sylph end here, however, as with the figure of German literature visitant and host are of the same sex (male), whereas with the figure of French literature, they are of the opposite sex.</page><page sequence="11">Behind the Veil of Translucence 77 with which she is invested throughout the novel. Originally conjured by Alvaro, an arrogant young man who has fallen in with some necromancers, Beelzebub first appears as a huge camel's head (Fig. 1), and then transmutes successively into a spaniel, signora Fiorentina, the virtuoso harpist, a page named Biondetto, and finally Biondetta, the Sylph. Cazotte exploits the very structure of the French language, with its masculine and feminine articles (un, une, le, la), pronouns (il, elle, lui), and declensions of nouns (chien, chienne) and adjectives (eux, euse) to reverberate between the male devil and the female persona who seduces Alvaro.h (An aside is apropos here on the taste for gender ambiguity in the Romantic ballet, visible in roles performed by women en travesti and critical reviews containing sexually dimorphic descriptions of female ballerinas.)' The reader is captivated as two distinct characters are developed in tandem: Biondetta is a languishing lover and he is an imposter, the devil lying in wait. When Alvaro spies on Biondetta as she plays the harpsichord and sings a barcarole, he hears these words full of double- entendre: Love, 'twas you who wrought this deceit, though I am thought the deceiver; O right this wrong with vengeance sweet and make him my believer. Let the ingrate know what I am, hWitness the masculine article and adjective suffix in the title Le Diable Amoureux, while, for the greater part of the novel, the devil antagonist is female. Stephen Sartarelli says that "the sex of this character varies according to the aspect it has assumed at a given moment, and oftentimes this aspect is dependent upon the protagonist Alvaro's subjective perception of it."

Is this the lament of a heart wrung with unrequited love or the devil's plaint, full of sophistry and chicanery? The reader vacillates between empathy for a lovelorn woman and awe of the demonic. Thus realistic detail, or rather commonplace literary convention, blurs into the bizarre in an irresolvable manner. In this way the text teases the reader into imagining two mutually exclusive narrative posibilities at once: Biondetta is only a woman; Biondetta is really the devil in disguise (Fig. 2). As Ora Avni says, the reader is "suspended between possible meanings, between equally plausible albeit mutually exclusive stories that double each other without ever merging into one coherent narrative."[221 What lends the sense of marvel (merveille) to the story most of all is that the devil has been given a human face. His foibles, machinations, and frailties resemble those of woman as she was painted by eighteenth- century discourses on the nature of the female sex, what was known as the querelle des femmes-the question of whether or not woman was inherently inferior.k "Forgive me for having run the risk of assuming all the imperfections of my sex in order to combine, if possible, all its charms," says Biondetta.1 Her imperfections? Violent passions, natural impulses, pride, spite, defiance, and fear. However, there is a gentler side to the gentle sex: Biondetta claims to be "one who sacrificed all for him [Alvaro], a weakly creature bereft of all succor but his, in a word, a JCazotte, trans.

Thus, what makes Biondetta so humanly real is that her model is not an individual, but an entire discourse, a template. Hence, it is the devil's uncanny likeness to woman (as constructed by French literary-humanistic tradition) that creates the sense of marvel. Biondetta's pouts and perturbations, her tears and wounds, her quixotic and chaotic neediness bring to mind another Sylph, at least, as we might reconstruct her from librettos and synopses of the plot.[23] Ultimately, it is the very vulnerability of the Sylphide that is her greatest attraction: The sylphide will die if he marries Effie; she expresses the most violent despair. The young man tries to calm her; his efforts are in vain, she will die if he abandons her. James' reason becomes altogether confused; he no longer sees anything but the danger of losing his sylphide, and she profits from his turmoil by drawing him along; they disappear together behind the crowd pressed around Effie.n Seeing human qualities grafted so seamlessly onto a fantastic being of the ballet creates the sense of marvel. La Sylphide exploits basic tensions: the pointe work and the unnatural techniques of the body create the sense of the inhuman, the unfamiliar, while the recognizable conventions of womanhood, the emotions and familiar displays, the naturalistic style, and the dancer's very body subvert these devices and restore the sense of human identity. Beyond the equivocal nature of Biondetta's character is the uncertainty of whether or not she exists at all as an independent entity. mCazotte, Sartarelli trans., p. 18.

Does she have a self of her own or is she merely a product of Alvaro's obsessions, an extension of his inner compulsions? "I should find it impossible to chase her from the vacant air if it pleased her to hover there invisibly and haunt my thoughts."'' Recognize the essential dilemma of La Sylphide: Is the air sprite merely a product of James' private thoughts and fancy-and through theatrical trompe-l'oeil and choreographic effect now she is there, now she is not- or is she a real being, as suggested by the shock to the young man when he realizes he has killed her, her wings falling off like a stripped butterfly's? It is when stabbed by a rival, wounded and bleeding, that Biondetta is most convincing and seductive to AlvaroP Even as the author, Cazotte, recorded his dreams in life, his character, Alvaro, recounts his dreams. They function as premonitions of evil or revelatory interventions. (Later, for Charles Nodier, the dream will become the vehicle of the soul's possession.) La Sylphide begins with a dream, or inside a dream, and its sequence of events remains as elusive as the mind-state of a dream. These pre-Freudian, psychological aspects of the mind's ability to float freely amid luminosity, released from the dull surfaces of daily life, distinguish both the ballet and the novel. But in his investigation of how the mind worked, Cazotte went beyond dreams and chimera. It was his protagonist's self-deceptions alternating with insight that gave the novel its remarkable psychological verisimilitude . In order to consort with the devil Alvaro must ignore the history of events, the necromancers' proceedings that brought Biondetta to life. At one point he rationalizes his love: "Man was made of a little mud and water. Could not a woman be made of dew, earthen mists and beams of light, condensed remnants of a rainbow?"'r (Images like these that personify the tricks light plays on the eyes will recur in Charles Nodier's Trilby, the reputed source of La Sylphide, and later in Jules Janin's abstract of the ballet in Les Beautes de l'Opera.)

Outer restraints recede as Alvaro is gradually overtaken by inner demons, embodied as a female double.s Biondetta's ability to play on Alvaro's weaknesses, to metamorphose into yet new incarnations of desire, to circumvent his every evasion, suggests that in some respect she is a replica of him. Speaking to Biondetta with an ironic sort of self-awareness, he says, "I, madame, am my only formidable enemy." Later, in despair he rants to himself, "And yet, who there [in a cloister] will deliver me from the chimerae born of my own brain?"t So too, James suffers this self-destructive subjectivity, this loss of connection to real-world relations, this consuming ghostly female double. The sense of the protagonist's complicity in his own deception undergirds the psychological realism of the fantastic. Significantly, in this first conte fantastique the figure of the Sylph appears directly. Biondetta is recovering from her knife wounds and fever. Alvaro, infatuated, now convinced that she is a woman after all, not at all an extension of the devil's talon, asks her who she is. "I am a Sylph by origin, and one of the most eminent among them."u She has assumed the bodily form of a woman in order to unite with Alvaro and thus ennoble her essence. For this explanation of Sylphhood, Cazotte was influenced by an occult work popular in his day, Le Comte de Gabalis ou Entretiens sur les Sciences Occultes (The Count of Gabalis or Talks on the Occult Sciences), written by the abbe de Villars and originally published sCazotte's invention of inner demons objectified as a double anticipates the appearance of the doppelginger in German literature, particularly in the work of Kleist and E. T. A. Hoffmann; the latter, in turn, influenced the French Romantic fantastiqueurs with his enigmatic doubles. The doppelginger was also given currency through the Schubert song, "Der Doppelginger," in his Schwanengesang (Swan Song, 1827-28), based on the Heinrich Heine poem, first published in 1824, from Buch der Lieder.

The late Enlightenment had witnessed a resurgence of mysticism, with the spread of influence of Illuminism, Martinism, Mesmerism, Swedenborgianism, and other such counter- cultural currents.[24] A surfeit of Reason and a conviction of its ultimate insufficiency had stimulated a taste for the irrational. The contefantastique represented a basic epistemological shift, the premises of how we know coming into question; veering toward revelation, the supernatural, and the unconscious, it anticipated Romanticism.[251 The illusion/reality fault "The Sylph figure may be seen, anachronistically, as a paradoxical embodiment of the concept of intertextuality, since it operates like a mise en abyme, infinitely referring the reader to earlier texts. In a preface to his excellent anthology, Sylphes et Sylphides (Paris: Desjonqueres: Diffusion, P.U.F., n.d., pp. 7-31), Michel Delon traces the literary history of the Sylph figure in the French language from 1670 to 1832. Before Cazotte's tale, the Sylph appeared in a variety of literary-theatrical guises and genres: novellas, an epistolary novel, imaginary voyages, moral stories, comedies, a comic opera, and an opera. After Cazotte, the figure added to its repertoire stories in verse, comedies with ariettas, character portraits and studies of mores, anecdotes, immoral stories, poems, and, of course, ballet. Delon explores a variety of themes expressed by the Sylph, all of which cluster around sexual desire and fantasy. I would add that origins in cabalistic literature and appearances in libertine and pornographic literature have given the Sylph an aura of illicit practice. My study is limited to the Sylph's incursions into the fantastic literature. Nevertheless, with regard to Cazotte's tale, it is worth noting the 1730 novella of Crebillon fils, full of wit and sexual innuendo, "Le Sylphe ou Songe de Madame de R***. Ecrit par elle-meme a Madame de S***." The Sylph here is gendered male as was typical in early representations (see Neidish, p. 10). (One could read the gender instability of Biondetto/Biondetta as a kind of historical sexual transformation-in- progress of the Sylph figure.) Indeed, Cazotte's tale may have been a response to Crebillon's; at least, the case for an intertextual reading is strong. The key quality of Crebillon's Sylph is his ability to read a woman's mind and hence satisfy all her desires: "we are a little dangerous as lovers, we know everything that transpires in the heart of a woman; she could not form desires that we could not satisfy, we enter into all her caprices" ("nous sommes des amants un peu dangereux, nous savons tout ce qui se passe dans le coeur d'une femme; elle ne sauroit former de desirs que nous ne satisfassions, nous entrons dans tous ses caprices"). The Sylph's ability to reflect the inner thoughts and motives of humans as well as the human's excessive curiosity make these tales comparable.

Conversation [in the salons] had practically ceased to treat of anything except elemental spirits, occult sympathies, spells, demonic possession, transmigration of souls, alchemy, and, above all, magnetism."Y Cazotte himself wrote stories of the conte merveilleux genre before he broke the mold with Le Diable Amoureux. Briefly involved in Saint- Martin's Illuminist movement, he later repudiated the actions of the illumines, who played a significant role in the Revolution, and he wrote his Revelations, prophesying the triumph of the royalist forces over "this many-headed hydra," as he decried it.z Tried and executed in 1792, he was later seen as something of a prophet, a maverick in an era of "the reign of reason" when "superstition and fanaticism [were to] make way for philosophy."aa Two aspects of Cazotte's philosophy are of particular interest here: first, the spiritist dimension, evident in a statement attributed to him by a contemporary writer: xRansom notes that "the Fantastic necessarily follows and replaces the fairy tale because of the rise of empiricism during the Enlightenment," p. 71; see also, Kessler, pp. xi-xii.

This morning, during the prayer, when we were all gathered together in the eyes of the Almighty, the room was so full of the living and the dead of all times and all countries, that I could no longer distinguish between life and death; it was a strange confusion, but what a magnificent spectacle!ab Second, Cazotte apprehended the existence of evil: "Good and evil on this earth have always been the work of men, to whom this planet has been abandoned by eternal laws."ac In Le Diable Amoureux, he symbolized the diabolical via woman's artifice and subterfuge, a metaphor that echoed the Church's longstanding conflation of the devil's attractions with woman's seductive powers.[26] Cazotte's sensibility for the marvelous led him to challenge the hegemony of Reason, and with this novel he created a new genre of storytelling-one in which reality and illusion were the real agonists. Reason alone gets the hero into trouble, for he can rationalize his consorting with the devil. Divine illumination counterbalances man's arrognant self-conceit. Alvaro's revelations are not complete until he experiences the ultimate degradation-until he has sexually consummated his relations with the devil. It is only through revelation, not reason, that the truth is ultimately fathomed.ad The devil in a dress who finally seduces Alvaro is wracked with spasms, tears flowing, chilled, without pulse, lifeless.

In this version of the text the climactic revelation is explicit and graphic, whereas in the original version it takes the form of Alvaro's sudden insight that he is possessed and his repudiation of the devil. Another difference is that Alvaro is the passive recipient of the devil's self-display in the 1776 edition, while he actively arrives at insight in the 1772 edition.

In La Sylphide the witch, Madge, as the Sylphide's foil, personifies this evil side, the other half of man's dual nature. In the ballet libretto her "hideous figure" first appears as James' eyes wander toward the spot where he last saw the Sylphide.ae In Act II James enters a fantastic women's world where the inhabitants are equally divided between sylphs and sorceresses. He confesses to Madge that he loves a "mysterious being that [he] cannot grasp"; he believed she was "an angel," but "it's a demon that takes pleasure in tearing my heart to pieces."af Madge provides James with the magic scarf to entrap the Sylph and he inadvertantly kills her; thus, the sorceress dupes him into inflicting her own revenge. In Le Diable Amoureux the translucent surface and the monstrous underside of the mask are signified in the two faces of the Other: "Her complexion looked like a veil of transparence. One could not imagine how such sweetness, candor and naivete could coexist with the cunning that sparkled in her eyes."ag The transparency is a deception, an illusion perpetrated by the female body. Yet, Alvaro has moments of true illumination, an anti- rational answer to the siecle des lumieres, for example, when he sees the luminous funerary figures of white marble, which seem to illuminate a chapel with their internal glow and remind him of his mother. To the contrary, the sexual female body is matter at its most insistent; decrepitude and death exist behind the luminous veneer of woman. In the climax of Le Diable Amoureux, after the devil admits she is indeed Beelzebub, then sexually overpowers Alvaro once more, she wants him to know her as she truly is: a very shrill hiss erupts beside me. At once, the darkness surrounding me vanishes; the cornice above the room's walls is now covered with large snails whose feelers, swaying briskly back and forth like levers, become jets of phosphorescent ae"figure hideuse," Taglioni, p. 13. afe"tre mysterieux que je ne puis saisir"; "un ange," "c'est un demon qui se plait ai dechirer mon coeur."

Note the light imagery with which Cazotte's novel is riven: on one hand, light forms an illuminating aura around the figure of goodness of the mother; on the other hand, it is phosphorescent, the mock enlightenment manufactured by the diabolical, that which is duplicitous, dangerous, disgusting. Light is associated with women in a murky ambiguity. In what I will call the translucent female body, light(ness) emanating from women became a dominant trope in the Romantic fantastic, associated with death as much as desire. The other side of the mask of transparency was the grotesque, and through this discourse the fantastic mood as well as its meanings were transferred from the contefantastique to the ballet blanc. Reconsidering the ballet La Sylphide and the novella Le Diable Amoureux from an intertextual perspective allows the researcher to see reflections of one genre in another medium.a' In the ballet the flexible, seductive border between reality and unreality of the conte fantastique could be represented by diaphanous costumes and gossamer movement style, by the portrayal through pantomime of an absence-a character visible to James (and the audience) but not to the other characters (see Fig. 4), and by the Sylphide's ever flowing and changing form.

One way the ballet fantastique theatrically replicated the fantastic rupture of the apparent, ordinary surface of reality was through a sharp discontinuity between Act I and Act II: in dance as in literature the mind out of control in dream, madness, or purgatory was a favorite haunt.am ak"Au milieu des groupes que forment les danseurs la sylphide apparait plusieurs fois, visible seulement pour James qui met le desordre dans la contredanse pour courir apres elle; mais elle disparait au moment ofi il croit la saisir.

Taglioni, pp. 18-9. alln my description of the ballet, I have been influenced by my viewing of a videotape of Pierre Lacotte's production originally made for television in 1971, and staged for the Paris Opera in 1972, which aimed for historical authenticity: The Paris Opera Ballet Company in La Sylphide, chor. Pierre Lacotte, 81 min., Kultur International Films, 1971, videocassette. Lactotte's choreography of a trio for James, Effie, and the Sylphide represents the paradox of the fantastic by counterpoising two simultaneous duets, one between James and Effie and the other between James and the Sylphide, which, in the viewer's perception, appear to converge into a trio. Thus, James seems to be managing a double life- simultaneous but discrepant realities. amJules Janin hints at this disjuncture when he makes the transition from Act I to Act II in his synopsis of the ballet: "Such is the first part of this fantastic story; the imagination can lay claim to its good share; nevertheless this does not go beyond conventional limits" ("Telle est la premiere partie de ce r6cit fantastique; l'imagination peut en revendiquer sa bonne part; mais cependant cela ne depasse pas les limites convenues").

This is not a parallel fairy world that glides unobtrusively alongside human order; the fantastic very definitely intrudes into reality with shattering effect. The stage space is drained of color (the bright plaids of Act I), overcast with pallor, like the face of the dying one during the death vigil.ao Viewers are ever in doubt about whether they are in a forest or merely inside James' mind. The protagonist collapses at the end when he must add to his loss of a grip on reality, the loss of a fantasy to fixate on. There is a dark underside to this ballet, with real undertones of evil and harm-through the witch figure, the killing of the Sylphide, the intense feelings of revenge and guilt, and the last note of James' despair. Jules Janin captured the reverse side of the fantastic, the intrusion of reality and hopelessness, projected by this ballet: What makes the charm of this little drama is that fiction is skillfully mixed with truth; the ideal sticks very closely to real life .... Few dramas are more moving; few are more lifelike. Reality, in the imaginative arts, is composed of everything that we find credulous [credible].....

In an author's note, however, Nodier indicates that the fragment is merely written "in the style of Cazotte.""ar Whether or not Nodier ever actually met Cazotte in his youth is open to speculation; in any case, he greatly admired his stories.[27] As a child Nodier had witnessed the Revolution close up in Besanqon, where his father had been a Jacobin, and he was deeply affected by the Terror. A bibliophile and a philologist, who in 1824 became curator of the Bibliotheque de l'Arsenal, where he led an important literary salon, Nodier was in the avant-garde of French Romanticism and well esteemed by his contemporaries. Reviewing a collected edition of Nodier's novels and stories published in 1832, Jules Janin said: Among the writers who occupy us, if one were to be chosen to represent the diverse nuances of modern thought, only Nodier would be capable of achieving this mark.... Nodier alone, stout child of the Republic, spirited young man, hero of the opposition under the Empire, man of passionate imagination and profound intelligence during the Restoration, brings with him and to his works something that recalls all the epochs so aqWith regard to the doppelgdinger motif, Webber proposes, "where female figures are doubled, it is typically as the objectification of a polarized male subject" (p. 4). In this sense, Madge may be seen as the other side or split-off self of the Sylphide, which selves, taken together, hold a mirror up to James' soul. The character Gurn, who schemes to assume James' place as Effie's husband, may be read as a "sexual impostor," another facet of the double (Webber, p. 13). Hilarion plays this role in Giselle, and Giselle/Myrtha represent the two poles of the female double. ar"dans le gofit de Cazotte"; see Charles Nodier, "M.

Attributing what he perceived as a mixing of cultural styles to the "great political conflagrations" of the recent past, Nodier freely imported ideas and idioms from foreign writers, especially in the melodramas he wrote for the boulevard theatres.at For example, in 1820 with Carmouche he wrote Le Vampire, borrowing from The Vampyre, a tale, published under Lord Byron's name the previous year, and in 1826 with Beraud he wrote Le Monstre et le Magicien, based on Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus.au However, as Max Milner is quick to point out with regard to vampirism, "England [only] rendered to France that which she had borrowed," since a key documentary source was the treatise of a French Benedictine monk, Don Calmet, entitled Traite sur les Apparitions des Esprits, et sur les Vampires ou les Revenants as"Parmi les ecrivains qui nous occupent, si l'on voulait faire un choix pour representer les diverses nuances de la pensee moderne, il n'y a que Nodier qui pfit atteindre ce but....

With inner torment enlarged and projected outward onto torment of others, the monster became the double-an excrescence of human evil. In this decade preceding the burst of the Romantic ballet on the scene, the melodrama was thriving on the boulevard. A hybrid of tragedy and comedy-"in one of her hands the mask and fool's bauble, in the other the dagger"-the melodrama played on the boulevard du Temple (known as "the boulevard of crime") and the boulevard du Saint-Martin.aw As Ginette Picat-Guinoiseau has pointed out, the very word spectacle, which heralded current events on the stage, implied the intention to astonish and to enchant;[28] here the marvelous could return from a rhetorical medium to a visual one. The marvels, what today would be called special effects, created spectacular denouements, such as a Gothic palace collapsing in flames while the protagonists, trying to escape up a grand staircase, were swallowed up by it. Pantomime was de rigueur, especially for the monstrous elements, and pantomime-artist actors like T. P. Cooke from England made their mark.ax Music, moving toward the programmatic, dramatized treacherous and poignant moments and imitated tempests, bursts of flames, and other calamities, or underscored words.ay av"I'Angleterre rendait ia la France ce qu'elle lui avait emprunte."

The French melodrama originated in a fin de siecle genre (Guilbert de Pixerecourt was the prime figure here) that was in the nineteenth century greatly influenced by Gothic developments abroad: the Gothic novel as popularized by Walpole, Radcliffe, and Lewis; the Gothic-Romanticism of German poets like Goethe; and the popularity of the melodrama on the English stage.</page><page sequence="30">96 Meglin Danced interludes were common, sometimes as divertissements and sometimes as recapitulations of the actions of key characters. Indeed, it was on the boulevard stage that the flow of the fantastic between literature and dance was first to be experienced directly. Nodier was very much a part of this process, with five of his melodramas staged with great success between 1820 and 1828, including Le Vampire. According to Picat-Guinoiseau, the young Joseph Mazilier and the young Jules Perrot performed in the danced interludes of Nodier's melodramas, which included a pas de trois in Le Vampire and a pas de deux in Le Monstre. Moreover, she notes that Jean Coralli (the future choreographer of Le Diable Boiteux and Giselle) functioned as a choreographer and director at the Porte-Saint-Martin from 1825 to 1829; "to him is owed the ballet of the Sylphs of Faust" (Nodier's melodrama produced at this theatre in 1828), "the first 'ballet blanc' of the repertory."az And Pierre Ciceri designed sets for Le Vampire and Bertram, ou le Pirate (1822), another of Nodier's melodramas, nearly a decade before he designed Robert le Diable, La Sylphide, and later Giselle. In addition to importing foreign genres to the boulevard theatres, Nodier brought contemporary literary currents to bear, particularly what he himself labeled the genre frtnetique (genre of frenzy or madness).[29] In the same period that he wrote for the theatre, he wrote the tales Smarra, ou les Demons de la Nuit (Smarra, or the Demons of the Night, 1821) and Trilby, ou le Lutin d'Argail (Trilby, or the Imp of Argyle, 1822), in which vampirism and sorcery were but the outer manifestations of human inner excruciation, of nightmare and madness. The themes that obsessed Nodier-trial, prison, and bloody execution,[30] a residue of the Revolution-would cross over between his contes and his melodramas, and go on to haunt later conteurs fantastiques. But, most probably, Nodier's storytelling was also directly influenced by his excursions into the theatrical genre of melodrama. Did the craze for trompe-l'oeil in the theatre influence the trompe-l'oeil of the imp, Trilby? Was the play of light and shadow-now transparent, now shadowy; now glowing, now darkening; the impending gloom and the partially obscured, all az"on lui doit avec le ballet des sylphides de Faust (1, 2) le premier 'ballet blanc' du repertoire."

Other aspects of Nodien melodrama would find their way into the ballet settings: ruins, chdteau et chaumie're (castle and cottage), forest, cavern, tomb, subterranean depths, wild mountains, and uninhabitable places at the edge of human civilization; the strange melding of the tragic and horrifying with the entertaining and spectacular; diabolical beings; and particularly the personality of the Romantic hero--"solitary, victim and abettor of evil," driven by infernal forces, an outsider in relation to society, a divided self, a being with two faces, despairing, possessed by a passion that "annul[s his] liberty," he is "an enigma for [himself].'"bb In an analysis of the symbolic use in political discourse of the vampire figure from fantastic literature, Clemens Ruthner shows how vampires were used metaphorically by Voltaire to refer to corrupt businessmen "who sucked the blood of the people in broad daylight" and to monks "who eat at the expense of both kings and people," by revolutionary zealots to baCiceri and Louis J. M. Daguerre introduced gas lighting at the Paris Opera in 1822. Nodier himself was well versed in the effects, applications, and dangers of gas lighting. He was co-author with Amedee Pichot, a doctor of medicine, of Essai Critique sur le Gaz Hydrogene et les Divers Modes d'Eclairage Artificiel (Critical Essay on Hydrogen Gas and the Various Modes of Artificial Lighting), published in 1823 (Paris: Charles Gosselin). In his melodrama Le Monstre et le Magicien, there was a pantomime scene in which the Monster, played by T. P. Cooke, reacted with emotional extremes to light, air, and fire rendered by stage lighting as well as music. See Le Monstre et le Magicien, Milodrame Feerie en Trois Actes, a Grand Spectacle, par MM. Merle et Antony; Musique de M. Alexandre, Ballet de M. Coraly, Decors de Mrs. Lefebvre et Tomskin (Paris: Bezou, 1826); reprinted in Charles Nodier: Oeuvres Dramatiques, II, ed. Ginette Picat-Guinoiseau (Geneve: Librairie Droz, 1991), p. 194. Hydrogen gas technology seemed to lure monsters from their murky depths in nineteenth-century melodrama in the same way that nuclear technology animated dormant behemoths, mutant ants, the living dead, and all sorts of phantasms in American science-fiction films of the 1950s. The fantastic crops up like a persistent weed in a milieu of scientific positivism, an idea I develop in Part Two of this essay. In Ines de las Sierras (1837) Nodier's description of la Pedrina, the mad singer and dancer, dancing in the light and shadow of the haunted castle, reveals further evidence of the interplay between the scenic effects of the stage and the contefantastique. bb"solitaire, victime et fauteur de mal"; "&amp;tres ia double visage"; "c'est la possession meme qui annule leur liberte"; "une enigme pour eux-memes."

For Nodier, vampires were linked with what would later be known as the unconscious mind-human anxiety and angst-and also with historical conscience. He noted that "inferences are not lacking to prove that certain of the most terrifying aberrations of man-sorcery, werewolfism, vampirism-are maladies of sleeping man, like somnambulism and nightmare.'"bc Like many of the Romantics, Nodier was fascinated with the subliminal state between sleep and wakefulness, a state for him verging on madness, when self-control slips away and one is capable of having murdered someone without knowing it. He shared with his contemporaries a pre-Freudian fascination with dream, somnambulism, and animal mag- netism or hypnosis. But his was a more historical and humanistic con- sciousness, which seemed to equate the irrational, violent excesses he had witnessed with a hypnotized and sleepwalking humanity. His tale Smarra, ou les Demons de la Nuit, written in 1821 in a style that anticipates both stream-of-consciousness and Dadaism, narrates a dream of his own guillo- tining: he sees his severed head rolling off the scaffold, catching itself by biting into a plank, watching the crowd watch the guillotining of a man.[33] This notion of the afterlife of a head severed from its body and rolling through space can be traced back to a poem by Cazotte published in 1763, Olivier, where rolling heads become talking heads: "Now then," I said, "these quarrels have gone too far." "Eh? No, no, leave us alone; is it not better to bicker than to yawn? What else is there to do for people with only ears and eyes, who have been living face to face for a century, who have no pleasurable relations nor hope of ever forming any, who cannot even resort to backbiting, since we do not know whom we might slander to make ourselves heard, who-"bd bc"Les inductions ne manquent pas pour prouver que certaines des plus epouvantables aberrations de l'homme: la sorcellerie, la lycanthropie, le vampirisme, sont des maladies de l'homme endormi, comme le somnambulisme et le cauchemar."

Oeuvres Completes, p. 1099.</page><page sequence="33">Behind the Veil of Translucence 99 In 1845 Nerval would read this poem as prophetic of the Revolution. In 1821 in Nodier, the persona of the severed head functions like historical evidence of the dead bodies, or punishment and guilt, long before the castration complex was invented, and it would be resurrected in fantastic works by later artists. Nine years after Smarra appeared, Hector Berlioz, in his Symphonie Fantastique (1830), whose very title suggests its desired associations with that particular genre of literature, created a hero who dreams of his own execution.be In his program notes for the first performance, Berlioz narrates the symphony's fantastic action: having taken an overdose of opium, a young musician in despair over a woman experiences a flight of dreams. Berlioz divides the fantasy into five parts: "Reveries and Passions," "A Ball," "Scene in the Country," "March to the Scaffold," and "Dream of a Witches' Sabbath.'"bf Like Nodier's Smarra, "The March to the Scaffold" relates the lived experience of a guillotining: He dreams that he killed his beloved, that he has been condemned to death and is being led to the scaffold. The procession moves on to the sounds of a march that is sometimes sombre [sic] and wild, sometimes brilliant and solemn, in which the dull thud of heavy steps is succeeded without transition by noisy bursts of music. Near the end, the idee fixe [the obsession with his beloved translated into a recurring melody] reappears for a moment as a last thought of love before it is cut off forever by the fatal blow.[34] beDavid Cairns suggests that the original title of the work, "Episode de la Vie d' un Artiste (grande symphonie fantastique en cinq parties)," was influenced by E. T. A. Hoffman's Contes Fantastiques (including a story called "La Vie d'Artiste"). In discussing literary influences on the symphony, he includes Gerard de Nerval's French translation of Part One of Goethe's Faust, Chateaubriand's Rene, Victor Hugo's "La Ronde du Sabbat" from Odes et Ballades as well as his novel Le Dernier Jour d'un Condamne, and Alfred de Musset's French version of De Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium-Eater. In the latter, Musset added a nightmarish dimension reminiscent of Nodier: the hero dreams he has committed a heinous crime.

Here, Berlioz's cacophony of sounds, grotesque and burlesque, seems to reverberate with Nodier's earlier prose:bh Your constricted chest shudders and heaves, in the effort to inhale life-giving air amid the dust of ruins, the smoke of torches, the dampness of catacombs, the poisonous exhala- tions of the dead ... and all the demons of the night are bgIt is clear from the title of the symphony that Berlioz equated the fantastic with the lived experience of the artist. In a letter to his father (dated February 19, 1830), written as he was conceiving the work, he referred to the emotional intensity of inner life that he had suffered from since childhood as "ce monde fantastique," this fantastic world. The programmatic aspect of the music was in no way antithetical to its irrational elements; in this it operated like the conte fatastique, blurring the line between realism and fantasy through the random- ness and implausibility of story. By publishing the literary program of the symphony in the newspapers in advance of its first performance, Berlioz intended to publicize the piece, partly through its autobiographical implications, as well as to make his process as an artist explicit. See Cairns (pp. 357-70). In Hector Berlioz, Correspondance Generale 1: 1803-1832, ed. Pierre Citron (Paris: Flammarion, 1972), Citron notes that this was the first appearance of the word "fantastique" in Berlioz's correspondence (p. 310). Can it be a coincidence that the years 1829-30 saw the recognition of a distinct genre of the fantastic in France? bhCairns sees this finale originating in the Walpurgis-night scene of Goethe's Faust as well as Victor Hugo's "Ronde du Sabbat" from his Odes et Ballades (p. 361). The idde fixe, the melody that recurs in a variety of guises, duplicates the obsession, the chimera, and the unveiling of the hideous of the contefantastique. First the melody appears in graceful and noble guise, a realization of the artist's inner ideal of beauty, often invoked. Its character is chameleon: rustic, dreamy, haunting, stirring, nostalgic, and burlesque depending on the setting. It ends up as "a vulgar tavern tune, trivial and base; the beloved object has come to the sabbath to take part in her victim's funeral. She is nothing but a courtesan, fit to figure in the orgy." Berlioz, trans. by Cairns, p. 360. "un air de guinguette trivial, ignoble; c'est l'objet aime qui vient au sabbat, pour assister au convoi funebre de sa victime.

Here, too, the sense of sacrilege, and especially the hero's (Robert's) participation in the sacrilegious rites, can be compared with Nodier's nightmare in Smarra: All the tombs were unsealed ... all the dead were exhumed ... all the ghouls, pale, eager, ravenous, were at hand; they smashed the boards of the coffins, rent the sacred garments, the last garments of the corpse, divided the hideous remains with the most ghastly delight, and, with an irresistible hand, for I was, alas! as helpless and feeble as an infant in its cradle, they forced me to join them ...

She vied for the torn remains with the maidens of Larissa, thirsty for blood. Smarra, with rapidly beating wings and threatening hisses, shielded the dreadful booty for the queen of nocturnal terror. Scarcely did he pause to caress Polemon's bloody heart, so as to quench his own thirst, with the end of his proboscis that spiraled out like a spring; and Meroe, beautiful Meroe, smiled at his love and vigilance.bn blFuseli (1741-1825) actually created several versions of this subject (see Webber, pp. 237-42). His imagery has often been reproduced and even caricatured (see L'Artiste: Journal de la Litterature et des Beaux-arts, tome 1, 13e livraison, 1831, p. 170). Swiss-born, he settled in England, where he made his reputation as an eccentric artist and self-touted genius. David Antin sees literary rather than plastic values in his paintings: the use of gesture, extreme theatrical attitudes, exaggerated musculature, projected motion, relative scale, and deformation to convey grandeur, terror, and erotic satire. See "Fuseli, Blake, Palmer," The Grand Eccentrics, ed. Thomas B. Hess and John Ashbery (New York: Collier- Macmillan, 1971). Martin Myrone sees Fuseli as a man of his time, influenced by changes in the art patronage system, the ideal of the "Sublime" as articulated by Edmund Burke, and postwar malaise (the Seven Years' War being "the bloodiest war of the eighteenth century, and the first truly global, imperial war").

How many times had one not seen Trilby, the pleasing elf of the Dougals' cottage, hop on the edge of the scorched stones with his little tartan of fire and his undulating plaid the color of smoke, trying to seize in midair the sparks that shot out from the embers and rose in a brilliant spray above the hearth!

Tony Johannot's 1845 etching (Fig. 7) also gives the sprite a childish, almost angelic innocence. In the text the lutin functions like a secret, playful lover appearing whenever Dougal, Jeannie's husband, is away, fulfilling her deep need for tenderness. But he is also like an adorable and perfect child for the childless Jeannie. He is a ray of brightness in a difficult life, a foil to the tough and inexpressive Dougal and the dour and dark Ronald, the old monk of Balva, who will try to exorcise the sprite. Trilby also symbolizes popular, pagan folk belief pitted against the rigid authority of the Church. Here, the mask of translucence has taken on the allure of a woman's unfulfilled desires, the promise of gratifications and private enjoyments boLike Cazotte's Biondetta and Crebillon's Sylph, Trilby mirrors his host's intimate thoughts and desires. The double is the psychological derivative of the protagonist, and she or he typically uses double entendre to express this relationship. "There is not a thought in my mind that does not belong to you. There is not a beat of my heart that is not for yours!" ("Il n'y a pas une pensee de mon esprit qui ne t'appartienne. 11 n'y a pas un battement de mon coeur qui ne soit pour le tien!"). Charles Nodier, Trilby; La Fee aux Miettes, ed. Jean-Luc Steinmetz (Paris: Flammarion, 1989), p. 98. bp"Combien de fois n'a-t-on pas vu Trilby, le joli lutin de la chaumiere de Dougal, sautiller sur le rebord des pierres calcinees avec son petit tartan de feu et son plaid ondoyant couleur de fumee, en essayant de saisir au passage les etincelles qui jaillissaient des tisons et qui montaient en gerbe brillante au-dessus du foyer! Trilby etait le plus jeune, le plus galant, le plus mignon des follets." Nodier, Trilby, p. 58.</page><page sequence="41">Behind the Veil of Translucence 107 outside of society's bonds. Trilby, whose name sounds like a trill (trille), is indeed a kind of grace note or embellishment on life-a kind of pre-Freudian pleasure principle.bq The reader, like Jeannie, would rather believe in the reality of Trilby because without him there is no elan. As Ora Avni points out, the reader identifies with Nodier's "hallucinating, dream- ing, or mad characters rather than with the pedestrian and unattractive ones," and reads into their state that is out of touch with reality "an ultimate simplicity of heart and harmony between one's inner life and the surrounding world."[37] In a darkly Romantic ending, Jeannie jumps into her grave rather than suffer the exorcism of the imp. The high rate of infant mortality at the time gave this fantastic story its undertow of realism. It is no coincidence that in the original preface to Trilby, Nodier mentions Cazotte's tale: The subject of this short story is drawn from a preface or a note from the novels of Sir Walter Scott, I do not know which one. Like all popular traditions, this one made the world tour and is found everywhere. It is the Diable Amoureux of all the mythologies.br However, in the Romantic period the alter ego of the fantastic is less the carrier of a wrongful path (to be shunned), than the inklings of an imaginative soul adrift in a prosaic society. Most scholars consider Nodier's Trilby to be the seed for Adolphe Nourrit's libretto of La Sylphide[381 and newspaper reviews of the time say as much: One would have never to have read Trilby, this delicious work of M. Charles Nodier (and who has not reread it a hundred times?), in order not to recognize in it the inspirations for the ballet of La Sylphide. The author of the programme is far from denying it. It was, besides, the most fecund source from which bqAssociating the name Trilby with Giuseppe Tartini's sonata Trillo del Diavolo (Devil's Trill, c. 1740), purportedly imagined by the composer during a dream, the reader infers a diabolical connection. In the early nineteenth century, the music of the old Italian masters of the violin had become a staple of the French school of violin playing.

Courrier des Theatres (March 13, 1832, p. 3). In an 1845 synopsis of La Sylphide, Jules Janin repeatedly quotes from Trilby to describe the mood and scenic effects of the ballet and even conversations between James and the Sylphide. See Les Beautes. bt "des que ses paupieres, appesanties par le sommeil, commenqaient 'a voiler ses yeux fatigues, Trilby, qu'enhardissait l'assoupissement de sa bien-aimee, sautait legerement de son trou, bondissait avec une joie d'enfant dans les flammes, en faisant sauter autour de lui un nuage de paillettes de feu, se rapprochait plus timide de la fileuse endormie, et quelquefois, rassure par le souffle egal qui s'exhalait de ses levres 'a intervalles mesures, s'avangait, reculait, revenait encore, s'elangait jusqu'a ses genoux en les effleurant comme un papillon de nuit du battement muet de ses ailes invisibles, allait caresser sa joue, se rouler dans les boucles de ses cheveux, se suspendre, sans y peser, aux anneaux d'or de ses oreilles, ou se reposer sur son sein en murmurant d'une voix plus douce que le soupir de l'air ia peine emu quand il meurt sur une feuille de tremble: 'Jeannie, ma belle Jeannie, ecoute un moment l'amant qui t'aime et qui pleure de t'aimer, parce que tu ne responds pas ia sa tendresse."' Nodier, Trilby, pp. 58-9.</page><page sequence="43">Behind the Veil of Translucence 109 What better medium than the ballet to reflect the transfigured nature- the animation, almost animism-of Nodier's tale? At curtain rise a sylphide is kneeling at James' feet; she contemplates him with love and expresses all the happiness she feels in finding herself so near to him. She flits around him, and placing herself above his head, she agitates her blue wings to freshen the air that he breathes. James' sleep is agitated, he seems to follow all the movements of the sylphide; she, driven by a desire that she would in vain repress, lightly approaches him and deposits a kiss on his forehead. James awakens all of a sudden, he darts after the footsteps of the sylphide, who steals away from his pursuits and disappears up the chimney.bu The air could be populated with ambiguous, translucent bodies that bounded with impish naturalism, filling in the spaces between real characters (clad in bright plaids that lent them mass) with a spectral realm. The fundamental rhetorical ambiguity, the phantasms of the conte fantastique could be fleshed out with fantastically light movement, aerial lifts aided by wires, white muslin costumes, and shimmering visual effects created by gas lighting. Even as the rhetorical medium of the conte invited the reader to invent two parallel, equally plausible explanations for the plot, so the visual-aural-kinesthetic medium of the ballet invited the spec- tator to see the Sylphide as a figment embodied, a bodiless woman (cousin to a headless horseman?), a paradoxical presence: absence as a presence, and presence as an absence. Physical elusiveness could stand for illusion. However, it seems that Nourrit may have been influenced by the larger discourse of the fantastic in addition to this single fantastic tale. For one thing, in Trilby the spectral seducer is male, while in La Sylphide it is female, as it is in Nodier's earlier Smarra as well as in Le Diable bu"Au lever du rideau une sylphide est ia genoux aux pieds de James; elle le contemple avec amour et exprime tout le bonheur qu'elle eprouve de se trouver ainsi pros de celui qu'elle aime. Elle voltige autour de lui, et se plaqant au-dessus de sa tete, elle agite ses ailes bleues pour rafraichir l'air qu'il respire. Le sommeil de James est agite, il semble suivre tous les mouvements de la sylphide; celle-ci, poussee par un desir qu'elle veut en vain reprimer, s'approche legerement de lui et depose un baiser sur son front. James s'eveille tout ia coup, il s'elance sur les pas de la sylphide, qui se derobe ia ses poursuites et disparait par la cheminee." Taglioni, La Sylphide, p. 10.</page><page sequence="44">110 Meglin Amoureux. For another, there is no mention of any Sylphs in Trilby, while in the opening of Smarra, as the protagonist drowses, this is the numenal world he enters: The Sylphs, giddy with the sounds of evening, swirl humming and buzzing around you. With the dull beating of their moth wings they sweep across your heavy eyelids, releasing a transparent multicolored powder that you see suspended a while in the darkness like a tiny luminous cloud in a deadened sky. They throng, embrace, merge together, anxious to renew the magical conversation of past nights, and to recount the extraordinary events which appear to your mind in the guise of wondrous reminiscence. Gradually their voices fade, or rather, reach you only by means of some unknown agency that transforms their tales into tableaux vivants, making you an involuntary actor in the scenes they have prepared-for the imagination of the sleeper, in the strength of his free and solitary soul, partakes of the perfection of the spirits. It soars with them, and carried miraculously amid the aerial choir of dreams, it wings its way from surprise to surprise until the morning bird's song alerts the adventurous company to daylight's return. Startled by the premonitory cry, they gather like a swarm of bees at the first rumbling of thunder, when heavy raindrops weigh down the petals of flowers beneath the swallow's fluttering wing. They fall, rebound, ascend, criss- cross like atoms driven by opposing forces, and disappear in confusion in a ray of the sun.by bvNodier, Smarra, pp. 2-3.

Moreover, in both Trilby and La Sylphide, airy, radiant, and shimmering qualities seem to hold sway over the darker, disturbed, dour elements; not so in Smarra. But there is one thing that La Sylphide holds more in common with Smarra, and even Le Diable Amoureux: the story refuses to resolve the question of whether the protagonist victimizes or is victimized. In Smarra, for example, it is intimated that Lucius has caused the death of his friend Polemon (or is he merely racked with guilt that he could not prevent it?) and thus he dreams his own execution. Le Diable Amoureux Alvaro remorsefully rebukes himself for abusing a devoted woman-or has he merely been manipulated by the devil? The protagonist's guilt bleeds freely into his torment, as it will later in La Sylphide and Giselle. Themes of seduction, self-destruction, and guilt will recur in a variety of ways in fantastic text and performance. The cyclical entanglement of characters in something beyond their control seems to signal a soul- sickness that in today's quasi-scientific language would be referred to as an addiction syndrome. This interpretation seems plausible when one considers not only the delight in bizarre and gruesome visions, but also the number of stories related to opium use, beginning with Thomas De Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium-Eater in 1822.bx choeur aerien des songes, elle vole de surprise en surprise jusqu'ai l'instant oui le chant d'un oiseau matinal avertit son escorte aventureuse du retour de la lumiere.

Kessler puts it, "contributed to his enduring vision of the degrading, soulless, even nightmarish aspect of sexuality, and to his fascination with the images of vampire predators who devour the internal organs of their victims."[391 Indeed, it is tempting to read the figure of dangerous female sexuality in the conte and the ballet fantastique quite literally as venereal disease, which must have produced the same fears and gruesome images of sexuality that AIDS does today. Moreover, in Paris between March and October of 1832, a cholera epidemic caused more than eighteen thousand deaths, causing widespread panic.by The female body served as a convenient symbol for contagion, in the multiple meanings of the word. Direct evidence of the connection between Nodier's darker sensi- bilities and the Sylph figure can be found in his melodrama Faust, based on Goethe's original (Part I, 1808). First given at the Theaitre de la Porte- Saint-Martin on October 29, 1828, the melodrama presented something unimagined by Goethe: Sylph dances ("danses des Sylphides"). In Act I, scene 2 Mephistopheles persuades Faust of the pleasures in store for him if he signs the contract: MEPHISTOPHELES.-Permit me to give you a foretaste of all the pleasures that will become your lot, if you consent to divest yourself entirely of your scholarly austerity.

Delon notes that the divertissements of some eighteenth-century operas-comiques associated the aerial world of sylphs with dance (p. 29). A review of La Sylphide in Courrier des Thedtres (March 13, 1832) cites as theatrical precedents La Sylphide (1733), an "arlequinade" by Dominique and Romagnesi; Le Sylphe (1743), a comedy by Poullain de Saint-Foix, and, though not by name, La Silfide (1828), a ballet choreographed by Louis Henri in Milan. The Opera had its own tradition of sylphs: Les Genies (1736), a ballet with music by Mademoiselle Duval and words by Fleury, represented nymphs, gnomes, salamanders, and sylphs in a gallant typology of love. Although it featured Marie Salle and Dumoulin in an entree called Les Sylphes ou l'Amour Venge, it had only a short run. On the other hand, Zelindor, Roi des Sylphes (1745), a one-act opera-ballet with music by Rebel and Francoeur and words by Paradis de Moncrif, was often restaged.

Its fourth scene was a "Concert de Sylphes," which, along with the other seven scenes, would be imported into his La Damnation de Faust in 1846.c David Cairns describes "the dense yet weightless sequence of downward-drifting harmonies" to signify the Sylphs as well as the sounds that "[jar] against the conventional order of metre and tonality" to render the devil.[41] Certainly, the corps de ballet (six danseurs and six danseuses) in Nodier's melodrama, which pantomimed fear, fury, and condemnation in spectacular crowd scenes and celebration in the nuptial festivities, would become a key part of Romantic ballets like La Sylphide and Giselle. Moreover, dancers like Joseph Mazilier, who would play James Reuben in La Sylphide, and an eighteen-year-old Jules Perrot, who would choreo- graph Carlotta Grisi's pas and scenes for Giselle,cd danced in Faust, which was choreographed at the Porte-Saint-Martin by Jean Coralli.ce caresses,//Et pour Faust, un moment, jeunes enchanteresses,//Belles de volupte, d'amour et de bonheur,//De vos voiles jaloux, deposez la pudeur."

Berlioz seems to have seen Nodier's melodrama; he writes in a letter (dated November 1, 1828) to his sister, "they have profaned [Goethe's] Faust in making of it an unworthy melodrama at the Porte Saint-Martin" ("on a profane son Faust pour en faire un indigne melodrame ai la porte Saint-Martin"). In a letter to Edouard Rocher (dated January 11, 1829), he notes that he had been asked to write the music for a ballet version of Faust, an offer that was rescinded when the Opera decided that the subject had already been exhausted by the melodrama on the boulevard. Berlioz, Correspondance, pp. 213, 229; see also Cairns, p. 296. cdGuest, The Romantic Ballet in Paris, pp. 206-7. August Bournonville would describe the "Perrot style" as "that of a zephyr with the wings of a bat, a divinity belonging not to mythology but to the occult, a whimsical being with an indescribable lightness and suppleness and a brilliance that was almost phosphorescent.

In both, the surrounding scene consists of the wedding games and dances of the villagers, which establishes a sense of realistic local color and community. Against this backdrop, a strange pas de deux takes place. In Faust the stage directions read: Mephistopheles and Martha dance a waltz, or rather, perform a pantomimic scene, in which Mephistopheles uses all the power of an infernal magnetism to subdue Martha, who, shivering with terror and pleasure in turn, seems at last to succumb to the will of the demon.cf The "infernal magnetism" is, of course, an oblique reference to animal magnetism or hypnotism, Mesmer's techniques, which had created a sensation in France and were part of the mystical counterculture of the late Enlightenment. In the print rendering of the performers' costumes published by the House of Hautecoeur Martinet, Mephistopheles' eyes are exaggeratedly wide as he hypnotizes his subject. For many, this eerie pantomime blurring into the giddy whirl of the waltz, the period's infamous dance of seduction, was the most memorable scene in the melodrama.cg Critics lauded the powerful, dark impulses it seemed to release: "this waltz, one of the most remarkable things of the piece, offers all that coquetry, terror, and awe hold that is most expressive." This was staged "satanic power": "Thus dances the devil, if the devil dances.",ch Faust, choreographed by Andre Deshayes, another link between this melodrama and Giselle. See Guest, The Romantic Ballet in Paris, pp. 205-6, 296. The London Faust was billed as a grand ballet with scenes from the opera ballet produced in Paris under the title La Tentation. Guest, Jules Perrot, p.25. cf"Mephistopheles et Martha dansent une valse, ou plut6t, jouent une scene de pantomime, dans laquelle Mephistopheles emploie toute la puissance d'un magnetisme infernal pour soumettre a' ses lois Martha qui, tour-a-tour, fremissant de terreur et de plaisir, semble enfin succomber sous la volonte du d6mon." Faust, reprinted in Picat-Guinoiseau, Une Oeuvre, pp. 151, 154. CgIvor Guest suggests that this scene, arranged by Lemaitre with assistance from Coralli, was the seed from which sprang the pas d'action that would become central to Perrot's choreographic style.

He is so distracted that he forgets to invite his fiancee; it is she who must come to invite him to dance."i Like Mephistopheles, the Sylphide casts her spell through the senses, exuding animal magnetism. In her gaze lies the mesmerizing eye contact that makes James oblivious to everything else: in this round formation, if the white dress happens to pass, if the rustling of the jealous wing happens to be heard, if the sad and moved gaze of the familiar sprite sparkles like a smoldering flame, suddenly Master James drops Effie's hand and hurls himself after the demon who calls him, he no longer sees anything but the Sylphide, pursuing her with soul and eyes.cj At least this was how Jules Janin recreated the moment in his storybook synopsis of the ballet in Les Beautes de l'Opera ou Chefs-d'oeuvre Lyriques (The Beauties of the Opera or Lyric Masterpieces), and everywhere in his account one reads the demon behind the dazzling light: "she is the amorous image, the fairy of the flourishing fields, the demon of the hut.'"ck The very technique of pointe could be used to suspend disbelief as well as to render the apparition's shadowy underside, as it teetered and swayed between coquetry and malice: She arrived on the tip of the toe and balanced graciously, tossing her body sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left. satanique"; "Ainsi danse le diable, si le diable danse."

Much later, the more benign waltz in the kermesse scene of Gounod's Faust would become one of its most popular numbers.

Janin has Nodier's Trilby specifically in mind here; he actually quotes liberally from Trilby in narrating the ballet, for example, "'She bounds with an infant's joy in the flames,' says Nodier"cm (see Fig. 6). Nonetheless, the memorable dance sequences from the latter's Faust would have left their theatrical residue on the ballet stage. An intertextual reading of these dances of seduction suggests that spectators of the time may have experienced the radiant lightness of the Sylphide as a transmutation of darker, satanic powers.[43] In Faust, after the famous seduction waltz comes the Walpurgisnacht (Act I, scene 10). As the sorceress Bembo presents Faust with the elixir that "reju- venates old men" and "resuscitates the dead," horrible visions fill the stage: Mothers, holding children with slit throats in their arms, flee troops of assassins who pursue them weapon in hand; men, holding their heads in their arms, pass by and hover on the mountain.

Beauc6's engraving for the witches' Sabbath from La Sylphide in Les Beautes de l'Opdra ou Chefs-d'oeuvre Lyriques. Old Madge, the sorceress, who is seen inciting her cronies, is associated with symbols of night, foul air, poison, and death. Janin describes her as "the embittered enemy of beauty and youth." By courtesy of the Annenberg Rare Book and Manuscript Library, University of Pennsylvania. Such phantasmagoria strikes the same nightmarish chord as that of Nodier's earlier work, Smarra. It also recalls Alvaro's glimpse of the devil after he has made love to the spellbinding Biondetta. The sorceress with her age-defying, time-defeating elixir smacks of the vampire who prolongs her life by drinking the blood of men-a figure who will be recycled as Clarimonde, a centuries-old courtesan, in Theophile Gautier's La Morte Amoureuse (to be discussed in Part Three). When the natural order and sequence of death is defied by human interference, all hell breaks loose. Again, the violent and bloody undertones of the Revolution and war-ravaged Europe seem locked into symbols of sexual passion. The first act of Faust ends with a general witches' Sabbath. The bizarre visions of the witches' Sabbath in Act II, scene 1 of La Sylphide seem rather tame by comparison (Fig. 8). A lantern in one hand and a broomstick in the other, twenty witches, each accompanied by a "hideous animal," encircle Old Madge's cauldron and stir up the flames</page><page sequence="53">Behind the Veil of Translucence 119 of the fire with grotesque jumps. They gather poisonous substances (hemlock and severed body parts of animals), and perform a "fantastic dance of the witches." Reading from the "great book of the Cabala," Old Madge makes the conjuration and, soaking different objects in the stew, she creates talismans to distribute among the witches, but she keeps the lethal scarf for herself. Then they all drink from the brew, clinking their glasses and sending out "shrill cries."co Still, the very staging of a witches' Sabbath and the telltale "head of a dead person" among the sorceress' utensils recall the Walpurgisnacht of Faust. Moreover, the specific reference to the fantastic in the dance of the witches as well as an earlier description of the Sylphide as a "fantastic being" gesture more generally to the fantastic mode.cp The double has a double: the monstrous sediment of the Sylph, herself distilled of impurity, is Madge. One is necessary to the other: a divided self, looking at oneself, externalized (Fig. 9). In the visual and verbal imagery of the ballet, the winding sheet seems to represent this unveiling of good and evil, this ambiguous tissue between the radiant and the hideous, as well as the fragile suspension between life and death and the unraveling of human desire. Janin encapsulated this moment with a final vivid image: But no one could express how much suffering Mademoiselle Taglioni knowingly put in the denouement of her drama; one could have called it the agony of a beautiful lily; she died little by little, slowly, an aerial death, the horrible sorceress slyly watching this dreadful death. Meanwhile, the sisters of the Sylphide descended from the clouds carrying the gauze winding-sheet, and the melancholy group loses itself above in the silent cloud.cq The story of Doctor Faust was based on a medieval legend (as was that of Robert le Diable) and its revival in the Romantic period reflected c"'animal hideux"; "Danse fantastique des sorcieres"; "le grand livre des cabales"; "cris aigus." Taglioni, pp. 22-3. CP6"une tete de mort"; ".tre fantastique." Taglioni, pp. 21, 11. cq"Mais personne ne saurait dire combien de douleurs mademoiselle Taglioni savait mettre dans le denofiment de son drame; on efit dit l'agonie d'un beau lis; elle mourait peu ia peu, lentement, d'une mort aerienne, I'horrible sorciere regardant d'un oeil narquois cette mort funeste. Cependant les soeurs de la Sylphide descendaient des nuages portant le linceul de gaze, et le groupe melancolique se perdait Ia-haut dans le nuage silencieux" (p. 23). The libretto says simply that the Sylphide's sisters cover her face with a scarf and carry her away in the airs (p. 30).</page><page sequence="54">120 Meglin . : . .. .... .. ... .. ....? . ... .: ..... . : ..... :.:: :.:: ..... . `::: : " . . .:: ... ::::i-:: ::-:.:--..-i. .. ... - : - .:: -:: .:..::. ..--. - .

The devil was then 'a la mode in Paris. One need only consider the number of "devil" ballets and operas to affirm the fascination: Robert le Diable, Le Diable Boiteux, Le Diable Amoureux, and Le Diable a" Quatre. But one can also find more specific echoes of Faust in particular Romantic ballets. The Asmodee-Cleophas pairing in Le Diable Boiteux resembles that of Mephistopheles-Faust in a variety of ways: the magical transport, the overtures of pleasure, the walking through walls, the watching of women who cannot see them, and the entry into women's domiciles or private spaces. In Act I, scene 12 of Le Diable Boiteux, Asmodee conjures a dance of the Sylphs to delight his earthly patron, Cleophas (a student rather than a doctor), just as Mephistopheles does to seduce Faust.[441 Notice also that the central action of the willful seduction of a pure peasant woman by a newcomer disguised to achieve that end recurs in the ballet Giselle, if lacking its diabolical overtones, which occur only in Act II. Marguerite's mad scene (Act III, scene 5), with its confused and dissociated memories, foreshadows Giselle's. One even finds a precursor of the famous flower scene in Giselle in Faust Act II, scene 17: "he loves me, he loves me not.... ""cr In the first scene of the melodrama, Faust introspectively examines his own malaise: "The more I acquire knowledge, the more I sense the void and uselessness of it."cs One of the underlying threads of the fantastic was the insufficiency of science to explain human reality, be it the science of the eighteenth century's Age of Reason or the positive, empirical, and mechanistic science of the nineteenth century's Industrial Revolution. A review of La Sylphide, appearing in the Courrier des Thedtres on March 13, 1832, the day after the ballet's premiere, provides cr"MARGUERITE--I m'aime, il ne m'aime pas...," Faust, reprinted in Picat- Guinoiseau, Une Oeuvre, p. 182. Does this children's game symbolize deflowering in a tone tinged with irony? In Giselle, "She picks some daisies, and plucks the petals to assure herself of Loys' love." ("Elle cueille des marguerites, et les effeuille pour s'assurer de l'amour de Loys.") Were the daisies-marguerites in French- meant to evoke the earlier character?

If ever one wanted reality, it is assuredly in our century; we even want too much of it, because this pushes men toward general skepticism after which they do not believe what they see and only take stock in what they hold. At bottom, this philosophy is as good as another! And in spite of this, there is a taste, or rather a vogue of the fantastique, which, to begin with, has been no less timely, thanks to recondite romantic writings, where, in the process of looking for the truth, one puts everything in question, where in running after that which is, one encounters, by a singular piece of bad luck, only that which is not. Thence, these voyages into imaginary spaces, which the public has been obliged to undertake to follow our modern luminaries, and from which it always returns knowing less than at its departure, and rather more disquieted than reassured, rather more stunned than moved."t What is astonishing about this introduction to the ballet, full of broad references to literature and science, is that it is an introduction to a ballet at all. Indeed, the review's allusions to the tale that pitted the real against the unreal suggest that the Romantic ballet was kind of seismic center of ct"Les sciences positives on fait aujourd'hui trop de chemin pour que l'on s'occupe encore de celles qui sont purement conjecturales. Si jamais on a voulu da la realite, c'est assurement dans le siecle oui nous sommes; on en veut meme trop, car cela pousse les hommes vers le scepticisme general d'apres lequel ils ne croient pas ce qu'ils voient et ne comptent que sur ce qu'ils tiennent. Au fond, cette philosophie en vaut bien une autre! Et malgre cela, il y a un gouft, ou plut6t une mode de fantastique, qui, pour commencer a passer, n'en a pas moins eu son temps, grace aux elucubrations romantiques, oui, tout en cherchant la verite, on a tout mis en question, oii en courant apres ce qui est, on n'a, par un guignon singulier, jamais rencontre que ce qui n'est pas. De lI, ces voyages dans les espaces imaginaires, que le public a ete oblige d'entreprendre pour suivre nos modernes genies, et dont il est toujours renvenu moins informe qu'd son depart, et plut6t inquiet que rassure, plut6t tourdi qu'emu."

The anonymous reviewer continues, "The absurd part of the adventure is that these writers, so-called innovators, with their vampires, their fantasized heartthrobs, their sorceresses, the imps and pages of every kind that they place in their retinue, not only innovate or invent nothing, they trail on the heels of the ideas, the traditions that date back to the cradle of the literary world."cu Although the critic blurs the (twentieth- century) distinction between the marvelous (the fairy tale) and the fantastic in his literary chronology, nonetheless, his identification of vampires, sorceresses, imps, and pages as the topical stuff of literature, especially in the context of a review of the premiere performance of La Sylphide, clearly locates this ballet within the tradition of the fantastique. This review in itself offers evidence that it is important to read the ballet blanc of the Romantic era vis-ai-vis the conte fantastique. So far I have attempted to illuminate the fantastic in the Romantic ballet through specific reference to its literary precedents in a genre that focused on man's dark side in the late Enlightenment and post- Revolutionary/post-Napoleonic periods."c With Le Diable Amoureux, Cazotte created a new genre of fiction that reinvented the frisson of the marvelous for late eighteenth-century tastes. This genre reemerged in the nineteenth century as an expression of nightmare, madness, and frenzy simultaneously in Nodier's genre frenetique and his melodramas of horror on the boulevard. Drawing comparisons between specific ballets, notably La Sylphide, and specific fantastic tales and diabolical melodramas reveals a wide variety of narrative structures and visual-aural-kinesthetic symbols that, as they seem to echo each other across genres and art forms, suggest a larger cultural discourse. Was the ballet fantastique, in spite of all its translucent lightness, really a dance of darkness? Parts Two and Three will focus on fantastic tales that were published during the same period as the ballet fantastique, which, for the purposes of this study, I limit to the decade between 1831, the year cu""Le plaisant de l'aventure c'est que ces ecrivains, soi-disant novateurs, avec leurs vampires, leurs flammes bleus, leurs sorcieres, les diablotins et les grooms de toute sorte qu'ils plagaient a leur suite, non-seulement n'innovaient, n'inventaient rien, mais encore se trainaient servilement sur des idees, sur des traditions qui remontent au berceau du monde litterateur."

Hoffmann erupted on the literary scene in France between 1828 and 1830, with many translations of his tales, along with critical assessments, appearing in periodicals like La Revue de Paris, while Lobve Veimars published a sixteen-volume collection of translations over two years, beginning in 1829. The whole literary world was stirred, according to Jean Decottignies, and a fascination for the fantastic resulted that could not fail to make an impression on aspiring young authors of the July Monarchy.[451 Nodier and Nerval published their essays on the fantastique in 1830 and the fantastic tale acquired almost the status of an author's initiation rite into the profession in France. It inspired all manner of literary efforts, popular and serious, from the likes of Honore de Balzac, Theophile Gautier, and Prosper Merim6e to lesser-known authors like Jules Janin, Philar&amp;te Chasles, and Charles Rabou. Considering this literary milieu, I am going to argue for a rather sinister interpretation of the ballet blanc because I do not believe it was beautiful in the saccharine, sentimental, or innocuous ways we might perceive from the uninitiated point of view of the present. I want to get at the monstrous underlying, the bizarre bedrock from which it sprang. Nor need one fly as far as enchanted German forests to find precursors for spectral man-eating women; they had their ancestral spirits in the vamps and vampires of the French fantastic literature and the demons who regularly regurgitated themselves like recurring nightmares.
