<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tudor Balinisteanu Otherworldly Women and Neurotic Fairies: The Cultural Construction of Women in Angela Bourke's Writing This essay is concerned with the relationship between stories and social reality in Angela Bourke's writing. Bourke has written a short story collection entitled By Salt Water and is an academic working on subjects related to Irish folklore and the mythological tradition.1 I will analyse the interconnections between Bourke's work as a cultural historian and as an author of short stories in order to show that her assessment of the social value and disciplining effects of narratives emphasizes the way in which physical bodies and landscapes are imbricated with a community's body-social or official body politic. This will allow me to explore how the corpuses drawn upon in narratives, such as those of the folk and fairy-tale tradition, but also those derived from Enlightenment myths, discipline audiences while at the same time legitimating the social order and dictating patterns of socialization. In The Burning of Bridget Cleary (1999), Bourke investigates to what extent the events of the social world are scripted through stories derived from myths and folk-tales 'by disentangling the various strands of narrative which survive about the death of Bridget Cleary/2 An important focus of her study is the relationship between women's bodies and nature represented in Irish folk-tales and in metropolitan and nationalist discourses derived from Enlightenment myths. We may regard these three kinds of discourses as major undercurrents shaping feminine identity in nineteenth-century Irish culture. Their echoes are explored by many Irish writers concerned with the constructions of women's social personae.3 The subtitle to Bourke's study of the Clearys' case, 'A True Story', suggests several points for critical reflection: what is the relationship between stories and reality? How does a story become true? How do stories shape social personae? I shall seek to answer these questions in relation to Bourke's writing and with reference to wider Irish cultural contexts. In answering these questions I will treat Michael Cleary as a character in Bourke's text, even though it is an academic study. This will help me to distinguish between Bourke's Cleary and the historical Cleary. This distinction is necessary in order to add my own analysis of 492</page><page sequence="2">OTHERWORLDLY WOMEN AND NEUROTIC FAIRIES the constitution of the social persona of the historical Michael Cleary. I will begin with a brief examination of the opening story of Bourke's By Salt Water, entitled 'Deep Down', in order to explain her critical vision through one of its literary manifestations. 'Deep Down' shows us that a narrative pattern can serve to constitute different stories carrying different meanings, according to the ways in which they are related to cultural contexts and traditions. I. Identities In 'Deep Down' the narrator recalls a medieval text drawn from a manuscript from the Clonmacnois monastery in Ireland.4 The medieval text tells of a supernatural event in which people gathered around for Mass one day saw 'a boat up there in the sky. An ordinary boat, like you'd see on the sea or on a lake, but it was up above the roof of the church.... They were looking at the bottom of it.'5 Its anchor had been caught in the church door. A man swam down to untangle it and, when restrained by the people, he asked them to let go because they were drowning him. Liam, the narrator's collocutor, rejoins with a tale from his grandfather, a fisherman who had once 'fished' a young boy from the sea 'a live baby, fit and well, with clothes on it.'6 In this tale 'a woman came up beside the boat in the water and cursed them up and down for hooking the child out of its cradle down below.'7 The medieval tale helps its audience to conceive higher realms that mirror the human world. Part of the network of Christian religious discourses, the tale corroborates the authority of the Father. Our world is made in the semblance of the higher world of Godly authority. On the other hand, in Liam's version of the tale, the fact that the lost baby is reclaimed by a woman makes possible the reading of the seascape as a womb. The child had been hooked up from the womb's cradle. This tale suggests that perhaps our world too is lodged within a feminine body of nature, allowing for the possibility of a symbiotic relationship between this world and the body of nature. The two stories narrated in 'Deep Down' offer two ways of reading the world through the same narrative pattern: one reading corroborates the masculine authority of the Father, the other maternal authority.8 'Deep Down' suggests that reiterations of the same narrative pattern may engender mutually exclusive ontological norms. The tale throws into relief the fact that frameworks of knowledge naturalized through the reiteration of a narrative pattern cannot hold meaning on their own, but only in relation to the norms of other texts. Every narrative instantiation of a series of events is always part of a contextual network in which the meanings of tales are assimilated, repudiated, or 493</page><page sequence="3">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW conflicting. In 'Deep Down', the version of the fabula that corroborates the authority of the Father can be installed in the network of religious texts that 'fill in', even saturate, the possibilities of expression that the narrative pattern makes available. But in doing so, the possibility of using the narrative pattern to convey norms of maternal authority is repudiated. In Bourke's text the latter possibility is recuperated, but only in order to show that such a loading of the pattern with meaning is competitive, not definitive. To paraphrase Jacques Derrida, Bourke's story shows that every semiotic marking that a tale achieves is also a remarking of (repudiated) possibilities of signification.9 In 'Deep Down', the first story uses the image of the sea metaphorically to represent a body holding God's creation; this body is also a body social, a community of people sharing common beliefs. The world hosted in the sea-womb in the second story appears impenetrable by comparison to the sea-world of the first story. The fisherman is alone at sea, aloof from the social community; a feminine figure reclaims the child here. We recognize such themes of the impenetrability of nature and of women's bodies and of their threatening reclamation of authority in Bourke's study of the Cleary case. We may also read its arguments through Adriana Cavarero's thesis on the exclusionary relationship through which the (masculine) logos is legitimated by repudiating (feminine) bodies: The terrifying nature of the banished body is substantially female. It could not be otherwise within a logocentric ... polis. In the polis, free males reserve the power of the logos for themselves, uprooting themselves from a carnal existence perceived only as the disquieting attachment to a life that is prelogical, prehuman, and nearly animal: therefore female.10 Bourke's study points out that late nineteenth-century Irish metropolitan, nationalist, and folklore discourses establish in various ways relations between women's bodies and the body of nature. Through these discourses (but in different ways) Bridget Cleary's identity was marked by visions of her physical existence in a 'prelogical, prehuman, and nearly animal' organic integration of body and land. The Bridget Cleary shown to us by Bourke appeared to her husband and to her peers in the rural Irish community as somehow not yet fully born out of the body of nature, an otherworldly woman; on the other hand, representatives of the dominant social institutions of the time, the doctor and the priest who visited her, 'reported that she appeared to be in a very nervous state of mind and "possibly hysterical"'.11 Caught in these two different social strata the perceived association between 494</page><page sequence="4">OTHERWORLDLY WOMEN AND NEUROTIC FAIRIES Bridget and nature is explained in different ways that transform Bridget into an other: she is a fairy and a neurotic woman. In metropolitan, nationalist, and folklore discourses Bridget Cleary's identity is derived from logocentric frameworks naturalized through citational chains that sometimes cross. These citational chains can be seen as constitutive of social myths. A social myth comes into existence through narrative reiterations that yield consistently similar social imaginaries.12 Social myths, thus, provide the framework of knowledge instituting an interpretative cultural code that fosters the same story over and over again, compelling its reiteration, in order to naturalize the story's worldview as norm. However, as Marina Warner points out, even though 'myths ... are perpetuated through cultural repetition ? transmission through a variety of pathways ... this does not mean ... that they cannot yield to another, more helpful set of images or tales.'13 Developing on this vision, my analysis focuses on several points argued in Bourke's study that permit an investigation of the possibilities of subversion of social myths that disempower women's identities. II. Stories and Reality The series of events to which Bourke's study of the Cleary case refers is presented in the form of a chronology preceding her analysis. Bridget Cleary is the wife of a relatively wealthy cooper, Michael Cleary. On 5 March 1895 she falls ill and is confined to bed. In the following days Bridget's father and her husband attempt to summon the doctor, who finally arrives on 13 March. On the same day a priest visits them to administer the last rites for Bridget. After that, Michael Cleary becomes increasingly convinced that his wife is a changeling.14 He resorts to fairy-lore, using herbs and rituals to attempt to get his wife back from the fairies. On 15 March, after an argument about fairies, while Bridget was sitting by the fire, Michael 'knocks his wife to the floor; she burns to death.'15 Bourke's study is prefaced with a story collected in 1937, which can be found in the archives of the Department of Irish Folklore, University College Dublin. In this story, a married woman was 'taken by the fairies'; they left in her place 'another old yoke'. The husband went to 'afairyman' to seek advice: Thefairyman told him that they [the fairies] would be passing by the end of his house on a certain night and that he'd see them - he gave him some herbs so that he could see them ? and that his wife would be riding on a grand grey horse; and when she'd be passing him to seize and hold on to her, that if he missed her he'd never see her again.16 495</page><page sequence="5">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW The husband obeys and manages to gain his wife back. When they return to their house together, 'the other yoke was gone off with herself'.17 Obviously, the story outlines an imaginary world. However, as Bourke indicates, the elements of such fairy stories are connected to reality in manifold ways: Viewed as a system of interlocking units of narrative, practice and belief, fairy-legend can be compared to a database: a pre-modern culture's way of storing and retrieving information and knowledge of every kind .... Highly charged and memorable images like that of a woman emerging on a white horse from a fairy dwelling are retrieval codes for a whole complex of stored information about land and landscape, community relations, gender roles.18 In this perspective, folk-tales can be seen as offering an imaginary grid for mapping realms of sociality, as well as a stock of social imaginaries interconnecting landscape, human communities, and individual bodies. These social imaginaries help to imagine the social personae that individuals adopt in social interaction. As Jack Zipes puts it, 'tales do not only speak to us, they inhabit us'.19 The tale prefacing Bourke's study can be seen as the vehicle of social imaginaries through which male-dominated hierarchies and gender regimes are legitimated by repudiating alternative possibilities of envisaging the empowering of women's identities.20 The tale condones the husband's effort to recuperate a woman 'gone astray', whom we may imagine as having achieved, at least in a fantasy world, a more empowering status than that of wife. When the tale relates that 'his wife would be riding on a grand grey horse,' the reader/audience may imagine her as a confident and independent woman.21 But the resolution of the events offered in the tale reflects the desired restoration of the male-dominated social order. The legitimating of female social roles as wives involves the othering of the woman, who must have forgotten herself, by blaming her lapse of reason on fairy magic. The otherworldly woman is cast away, and, to use Judith Butler's words in this context, the 'alternative domains of cultural possibilities' that the tale had momentarily opened are foreclosed.22 Indeed, as Bourke observes, 'the overwhelming message of the fairy legends is that the unexpected may be guarded against by careful observance of society's rules'; the stories establish 'the boundaries of normal, acceptable behaviour ... spelling out the ways in which an individual who breaches them may forfeit his or her position.'23 In the tale opening Bourke's study, significantly, it is the husband who restores the legitimate social hierarchy. While he is cunning and clear 496</page><page sequence="6">OTHERWORLDLY WOMEN AND NEUROTIC FAIRIES headed, the woman appears flimsy, easily spellbound by such pleasures and passions as have been attributed to the fairy world in the Irish tradition.24 The collaboration between the husband and a male sage ensures the stability of the legitimate social world defined, against the otherworld of fairy, as a realm of masculinity. The fairy otherworld appears as a realm of fancy, both in the sense that it is a realm where caprice reigns, and in the sense that whatever a woman may think she is in that realm, it is only an illusion. In such tales, the fantasy of women's participation, willingly or helplessly, in the activities of fairies, is used to define femininity by equating it with moodiness, flimsiness, and even an irresponsible craving of luxury. But I am wary of generalizing. I must emphasize that it is the world of fairy depicted in late nineteenth-century rural Ireland that is perceived as a realm of femininity. And even for that temporal and socio-cultural configuration one may find that various discourses about fairy creatures made competing claims about the nature of this 'other'. Indeed, in some stories, the realm of fairy is a masculine realm from which male figures exercise tremendous powers over the people of the 'real' world.25 Thus, stories fictionalize the social rituals through which society's members consecrate a social order, serving to communicate the socialization scripts required by that order. Their narrative structures are derived from privileged meaning systems that determine what counts as human. Butler argues that 'the construction of the human is a differential operation that produces the more and the less "human", the inhuman, the humanly unthinkable.'26 This argument has particular resonance in the context of Irish folk-tales, where the construction of the human, social, materially real world is pitched against the otherworld of fairy, inhabited by immaterial shadows and less-than-human men and women. The wife in the folk-tale prefacing Bourke's study is less 'human' due to being in league with the fairies, but also because she is an independent woman. As with Bridget Cleary, this woman conjured through words may acquire inhuman powers through her alliance with the powerful body of nature. She is an impenetrable other caught in the corner of the rational eye. Thus, stories are the work of the imagination, but the imagination is harnessed to producing a range of social imaginaries that, if legitimate, imbue the subject with realness; and if not, the subject they create is imbued with unreality, appearing irrational, perhaps even abject. III. How Does a Story Become True? The occasion of the meeting of people attending to the ill Bridget Cleary the night before her death would have been one of 'talking and swapping stories'.27 Gerry Smyth emphasizes the import of such occasions, and the 497</page><page sequence="7">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW strong element of performativity informing the narrative event ... The story-teller is an active part of [the story], employing a wide range of skills to collapse the borders between the tale and the telling, while all the time maintaining the audience's investment in the world of the story.28 Bridget Cleary's death, as Bourke demonstrates, was partly the result of the belief that she was a changeling, a body left by the fairies instead of the real woman the fairies had abducted. Stories corroborating this 'reading' of Bridget had been told and swapped between her peers throughout the time preceding her death. However, Bourke's study suggests that it is misleading to regard the events surrounding Bridget's death as merely an enactment of the folk tales' 'changeling scenario'. Indeed, such strict tying up of the folk-tales' scenarios with the events that occurred in the social world would construct the members of the rural Irish community as mere actors, fulfilling an inescapable destiny to which they are condemned by their superstitious, irrational selves.29 In metropolitan culture, folk-tales functioned as vehicles by which rational men could express the otherness against which they defined social goals and programmes.30 Folk-tales threatened to open up a realm of alterity that would have unmasked the inability of Enlightenment consciousness to master wholly the field of meaning.31 The possibility of this alterity had to be tamed or cast away and foreclosed as a realm of the unthinkable, if reality was to remain governable through reason. In Victorian metropolitan culture, these axioms about consciousness translated into notions of social government. Bourke points out that the interpretation of the events leading to Bridget's death through folk-tale scenarios served British political interests: as legislation regarding Home Rule for Ireland was being discussed, the relationship between folk-tale scenarios and the events leading to Bridget's death was used to highlight the ungovernability of the Irish in the absence of a strong civilizing authority.32 To adapt Derrida's critical insight here, we can say that Bourke's study reveals the iterability of Bridget Cleary's story, which implies that the story can always be detached from the chain in which it is inserted or given without losing all possibility of functioning ... One can perhaps come to recognise other possibilities in it by inscribing it or grafting it onto other chains.33 To the extent that Bourke's study points out the iterability of the story in the context of widely different cultural discourses each structured by 498</page><page sequence="8">OTHERWORLDLY WOMEN AND NEUROTIC FAIRIES a different code, it also succeeds in showing that the story can disrupt, 'in the last analysis', 'the authority of the code as a finite system of rules', at the same time subverting 'any context as the protocol of the code'.34 Bourke poses the question 'when does a true story end?'35 Perhaps we may answer by saying that stories pass as true only with the consent of those who adopt the subject positions the stories set up, incorporating them into social imaginaries through which they fantasize their identity as individuals and as members of a social group, nation, or of a legitimate body politic. IV. The Role of Stories in Shaping Social Personae Bourke's study of Bridget Cleary's case seeks to point out the partiality and historical specificity of the identities of those involved in ways that also mount a critique of the Enlightenment claim to offer 'true' and privileged insight into 'the laws of nature'. Part of this critique is crucially concerned with what Jane Flax refers to as 'widely shared categories of social meaning and explanation' that associate women with nature.36 Enlightenment constructions of femininity, such as were deployed in metropolitan Victorian culture, are founded on notions of nature made governable through the laws of reason.37 In her study, Bourke reminds us that metropolitan cultural discourses served to envision Ireland as a feminine realm incapable of self-government. Borrowing Helene Cixous's words, we may regard the discourses of Victorian metropolitan culture as stemming 'from the power relation between a fantasized obligatory virility meant to invade, to colonize, and the consequential phantasm of woman as a "dark continent" to penetrate and to "pacify."' Women and nature are 'pieced back to the string which leads back ... to the Name-of-the-Father'.38 On the other hand, notions of women and nature also served, in a different manner, the interests of Irish nationalist circles, in whose discourses Ireland became an idealized feminine body, in need of defence and protection.39 If in British culture the envisioning of the masculine governance of nature remained connected to Enlightenment paradigms, positing an opposition between 'Man' and 'Nature', which entitled the colonizer to civilize dark, ungovernable realms, for Irish nationalists the legitimacy of the male's right to govern the body of nature depended on an uneasy alliance between 'Man' and 'Nature'. These two ways of envisioning nature as other affected representations of women in the two cultures and their influence can be seen in the representation of Bridget Cleary's relationship with the outside world. Both discourses can be seen to support Bridget's othering and abjection. Although in nationalist discourses the virility and paternal 499</page><page sequence="9">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW authority of the colonizer were challenged, this only resulted in replacing one manifestation of masculine authority with another whose legitimacy likewise depended on repudiations of women and nature; except this time, women as nature were pieced back 'to the place of the phallic-mother', to use Cixous's words in this context.40 Ireland's sons are one with her land. This investment of phallic power in the earthly mother is, in this instance, regarded by Irish nationalists as beneficial because it provides an origin story for the sons' eventual separation: they will set out to construct a new individuality and history for the primeval Celtic mother. Often, the phallic power of the mother is transmitted to a daughter figure, not fully separated from the mother, but who must acquire masculine features in order to be brought fully into existence in the social realm. Referring to women's identities generated through nationalist discourses, Edna Longley comments that 'while Virgin-Ireland gets raped and pitied, Mother Ireland translates pity into a call for arms and vengeance/41 To apply Cixous's argument here, the sons' separation from the primeval mother is only possible through a repudiation of nature that sublimates the female body into a female figure endowed with masculine power: a virago.42 In both British metropolitan and Irish nationalist discourses, the feminization of Ireland produces the fantasy of an elite brotherhood capable of privileged insight into the Taws of nature'. Fantasies of a masculine brotherhood are also conveyed through the patriarchal inflections of folk-tales, albeit differently. Examining folk tale fantasies based on the image of the fairy ring-fort, Bourke explains: In the narrative maps of oral storytelling, ring-forts function as alternative reference points to places of human habitation and activity. ... [T]hey can serve as metaphors for areas of silence and circumvention in the life of the society which tells stories about them. All the ambivalence attaching to them is contained in the common assertion that forts are where the fairies live.43 Throughout her study Bourke suggests that the folk-tales' referencing of otherworldliness can sometimes serve to corroborate a tolerant social order, open and respectful towards alterity, while at other times the tales may endorse practices of silencing and exclusion. Yet both possibilities are founded upon a dichotomous reading of reality that opposes the body of nature to the body-social. Bourke shows that the fantasies associating women with nature in Irish folk-tales are correlated with a mythical geography in which holy wells, fairy raths, and burial mounds represent metaphorically points 500</page><page sequence="10">OTHERWORLDLY WOMEN AND NEUROTIC FAIRIES of access to the inner realms of the body of nature. The body of nature is represented as a powerful feminine body, credited with the ability to punish illicit penetration: many tales contain warnings against transgressing 'fairy grounds', and speak of severe punishments that may afflict those who are not welcome to enter. An example of the folkloric rendering of the connections between women's bodies and the body of nature is offered by examining the concept of the piseog, which refers to a kind of black fairy magic. Bourke uses her expertise as folklorist to indicate that piseog is a diminutive form of the Irish word for the vulva, pis or pit. Piseog can also have the very specific meaning of malevolent sympathetic magic, when something organic is hidden and left to rot on another's land ... women's sexuality, when not controlled within the orderly progressions of marriage and pregnancy, was seen as horrifically powerful.44 Such folkloric beliefs posit an organic relationship between nature and women's bodies that, if not governed, threatens to wreak havoc on the orderly spaces of human culture. In this context, Bourke points out that Bridget Cleary 'had accumulated power, both economic and sexual, it seems, far in excess of what was due to a woman of her age and class, and when the balance tipped, all the anger flowed towards her.'45 Thus, Bridget's social status was read as illicit. Her undue empowerment rekindled suspicions about the resurrection of a powerful body of nature upon whose repudiation the patriarchal body-social of rural Ireland was founded. Although folk-tale fantasies of the female's relationship with nature can be enabling, in nineteenth-century rural Ireland such empowerment would have been eccentric and therefore required discipline in order to reassert a communal repudiation of women who deviated from domestic roles.46 Bourke's wider concern with the relationship between human societies and the body of nature emerges in her short story 'Le soleil et le vent', first published in By Salt Water. The tale is a reflection on the interaction between human technology and nature and thus on the inscription of the dichotomy between culture and nature in material practices. The technological process described in the tale is observed by the narrator in a coastal French town, where a system of canals is used to collect sea water and then its salt. But the narrator describes the technique in words that make us think of a body of nature that is made to sweat, like a slave tamed and harnessed through technological means: 501</page><page sequence="11">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW Behind us were the salt pans: hundreds of them, maybe thousands, lying in perfect flatness, rectangular, with rounded corners, moulded of clay and linked tortuously by channels that brought the sea in twice a day and trapped it there, making it give up its salt.47 The narrator of this short story and the critical voice of the study of Bridget Cleary's case share an interest in the importance of the written word as a mark that endows nature with human bodily features: 'Annick wrote the word for the salt-pans ... oeillet. Eyelet. Little eye. The local clay is watertight, so they can build banks and make basins that will contain the ocean, and each little salt-rimmed eye ... gazes back at the blue sky'.48 The attribution of anthropomorphic features to the body of nature by the people using technology to harness its power betrays the metaphorical relationships between nature and human bodies. The story shows that these inscriptions accompany practices that change both the geography of the landscape and the social geography of its inhabitants. Bourke's study of Bridget Cleary's case permits a view of the endowment of the body of nature with feminine features both as the result of colonialist Western discourse that, to use Donna Haraway's words, 'structured the world as an object of knowledge in terms of the appropriation by culture of the resources of nature'49 and of the pre modern rural folklore that inscribed patriarchal meanings in agricultural work practices and social living tied up with natural cycles. The images in 'Le soleil et le vent' reminding us of nature's ungovernability help the narrator to explore her feelings after the loss of her lover. When at the end of the tale the narrator realizes that her sadness has begun to subside, we are not sure whether the conversion of an unmanageable, oceanic emotion into calm is after all beneficial, just as we are not sure in Bridget Cleary's story that her association with a wild body of nature should be celebrated. By comparison with the 'calmed' woman shown in the short story, Bridget appears wild, eccentric, and passionate. In 'Le soleil et le vent' the narrator remarks that 'all around me' was 'the industrious sea, calmed and regulated, delivering its salt'.50 Bourke's book suggests that Bridget Cleary's body was punished precisely because it threatened to become an incommensurable otherness, unregulated by masculine government, and thus upsetting the social myths that welded the community together in its work and social practices. The above analyses show that we may suspect that the folk-tale tradition, the mythologizing tradition of Irish nationalism, and the metropolitan rationalist tradition, although working with different 502</page><page sequence="12">OTHERWORLDLY WOMEN AND NEUROTIC FAIRIES concepts of nature, share an investment in its ungovernability and conceive cultural tropes as a means of conveying the necessity of harnessing the phenomenal world. These cultural practices affect representations of women's bodies and of the body in general as realms of the organic that must be rationalized. Elizabeth Grosz argues that bodies 'are the centres of perspective, insight, reflection, desire, agency ... they function interactively and productively. They act and react. They generate what is new, surprising, unpredictable.'51 In Irish folk-tales, representations of feminine bodies are centred on the notion of a common ground between them and nature's body. However, the tales also attempt to regulate the perspectives, insights, reflections, desires, and agency that may emerge in the socialization of women's bodies through fantasies of this relationship that can take 'new, surprising and unpredictable' forms. In the following, I will use this framework to analyze the events examined in Bourke's study. I will show that metropolitan and rural folk-tale discourses, as well as discourses derived from them, rely on readings of women's bodies as ungovernable and that they in turn repudiate such unruliness in order to legitimate male-dominated gender regimes.52 Michael Cleary's interpretation of the relationship between Bridget Cleary and the fairy world through folk-tales rendered Bridget a signifier of impenetrable territories. Bridget's refusal to eat his offered food, which enraged Michael on the night of her death, making him capable of murder, may have been read by him as a refusal of sexual intercourse, as Bourke underlines. Furthermore, this obduracy might have provided for Michael an explanation for the fact that his marriage was childless, casting doubt on his fertility53 and thus metaphorically revealing an inability to inseminate, and thus master, nature's resources (signified by Bridget's body). Michael might have feared that his conjugal territory was becoming an impenetrable and ungovernable dominion of nature under Bridget's rule, undermining the legitimacy of his position as head of the household. His vision would have been underpinned by a correlative in the landscape: the round enclosure at Kylenagranagh known to the community as a fairy mound, that is an otherworldly realm inhabited by fairy women, with whom Bridget might have been in alliance. Michael had reasons to believe that his wife had been unfaithful; and she was a capable administrator of various small enterprises, and earned her own money. According to Bourke: People were talking about Bridget Cleary; she was an attractive and strong-minded woman, who enjoyed a higher level of 503</page><page sequence="13">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW personal and economic independence than most of her peers ... stories about her abduction by fairies could have been a euphemistic way of noting her extra-marital activities. Michael Cleary's success as a cooper, and his economic prosperity, would be of very little use to him if he could not convince his neighbours and his wife's relatives that he was man enough to keep her, and even to control her.54 His wife's independence as lover and as a partner in household administration might have helped Michael to find a convenient correlative in folk-tale imagery for repudiating as illegitimate the identity of independent woman his wife had assumed. The fantasy of the stately woman riding on a grand grey horse could have been read by Michael, consciously or not, as representing an usurper of the masculine right to govern his wife as he rules nature, a worldview conveyed (in different ways) in both metropolitan and rural Irish discourses. Michael used a corpus of narratives derived from mythology to legitimate his attempt to discipline his wife. Several myths were at work in Michael's fantasies about his identity and that of his wife. Examining these will help to establish how myths deployed in social discourses function in complex ways to determine one's acts in reality. Bourke points out that throughout the period of time after Bridget's death, until her body was discovered, 'two competing narratives were at work in the countryside around Ballyvadlea, as some people stuck to their story of fairy abduction while the RIC conducted its methodical search.'55 Michael's confused migration between the two world views, the Irish traditional and the British metropolitan perspectives, which these narratives endorsed, is indicative of a larger jostling of cultural norms. Their power lines are in some respects overlapping, yet in other respects disjunctive.56 Thus, when Michael fantasizes that his wife might be at the Kylenagranagh fort, riding a grand grey horse, he invests her with the otherness associated in official and vernacular discourses with the ungovernable landscape of nature, consigning her to a zone of the abnormal, the uninhabitable, and the illegitimate.57 In the meaning systems of metropolitan discourses colluding with the patriarchal meaning systems of folk-tales, legitimate femininity, the recognizable Bridget, is hardly ever a 'woman', but always a 'wife'; her body must be permanently available for masculine penetration, physically or metaphorically. Bourke notes, referring to Michael's attempt to force his wife to take the medicine prescribed by the 'fairy doctor', that 504</page><page sequence="14">OTHERWORLDLY WOMEN AND NEUROTIC FAIRIES the violence meted out to Bridget Cleary before her death has an unmistakeably sexual character. On Thursday when he used a metal spoon, and again on Friday, when his weapon was a burning stump of wood, Michael Cleary's actions amounted to a kind of oral rape. ... The violence used ... would have been enough to terrify her, and to show anyone watching just who was the master.58 For Bourke, forcing Bridget to eat 'was not so very different in significance from the force-feeding of suffragists and other prisoners by state authorities in later years.'59 Bridget's body, like the body of nature, had to be made available for the masculine staking of claims to possession, a requirement of both the Irish patriarchal order and the British/Anglo-Irish Enlightenment culture. Bourke insistently underlines the significance of the cultural investment through which Irish, British, and Anglo-Irish narratives interpret the landscape of the Kylenagranagh fairy fort differently: The fairy legends of oral tradition marked Kylenagranagh as important. The RIC mapped the territory differently, but in both systems Kylenagranagh was a significant reference point: the vernacular map of traditional narrative agreed with the police designation of the hill as a place apart from normal habitation and legitimate interests. Anyone seen there could be suspected of being up to no good; anyone desiring privacy might seek it out.60 Highlighting the fact that various discourses about the Kylenagranagh ring-fort reassert sometimes conflicting, sometimes colluding norms, Bourke's study shows Irish culture to be a heteroglossic space. It also indicates that the cross-pollination between these discourses is 'stress full' in the sense that, to use the words of Steven Cohan and Linda Shires, their markings inscribe the text with various stresses ... [T]he marks emphasise certain signifiers over others; they put pressure on the seemingly 'natural' and closed relations between signifiers and signifieds; and they can strain understanding, causing a reader to ask, what does this word, phrase, sentence mean?61 The discourses through which Michael Cleary interpreted his identity are examples of such stress-full cross-pollination. In order to achieve the bourgeois metropolitan identity to which he aspired, Michael had to show that he was capable of governing his wife. His conviction was 505</page><page sequence="15">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW 'stressed' through the local folklore tradition. Furthermore, both metropolitan and Irish folklore intersected in Irish nationalist discourses. The latter hijacked the Irish folklore tradition to create a bourgeois identity of Irish, as opposed to British, making. Thus, the heteroglossic aspect of Irish culture can be further investigated by examining intersections between the discursive registers of Irish folklore and Anglo-Irish culture that yielded Irish nationalist stories.62 Bourke points out that in the first reports of the Cleary case by the correspondent of the newspaper, The Nationalist, 'the language used ... is borrowed from romantic nationalism.'63 She also notes that 'the first account of Bridget Cleary's disappearance' offered in the paper 'reminds us that in 1895 the Irish Revival was at its height... books on fairies ... appeared throughout the 1890s to satisfy the appetite of a reading public which was reacting against industrialization and urbanization.'64 Lady Augusta Gregory and W. B. Yeats had begun their literary careers and contributed to the philosophy that insisted on the reclamation of the feminized Irish land by the Irish.65 This is the cultural atmosphere in which, Bourke notes, the RIC regularly 'patrolled the hill [at Kylenagranagh] in connection with National League activities.'66 The National League was set up by Charles Stewart Parnell in the wake of nationalist agitation regarding Home Rule for Ireland. According to the Irish historian, Margaret O'Callaghan, the local branches of the League devised regulations that drew upon the informal regulatory rituals inherent in the society ? or the brutal cruelties of control if one wishes to put it differently ? and formalised them. In so doing it attempted to set against the official law of the land a separate, intimately sanctioned behavioural code which defined self and other within rural society. It was a text of inclusion and exclusion, of community and pariah.67 The National League had staked their own claims on the body of nature. Their assertion of a right to governance, even though aimed at wresting authority from the British administration, issued similar claims, only this time in the terms of the local culture. At the same time, Bourke indicates, Irish Republican Brotherhood volunteers trained at the Kylenagranagh fort. Allied with the body of nature, read as a sacred mother/queen who rallies her sons /lovers against the foreign invader, the volunteers would have found spiritual sustenance in the tales of fairy power associated with ring-forts.68 Speaking of the need, in Irish nationalist circles, of identifying 'an 506</page><page sequence="16">OTHERWORLDLY WOMEN AND NEUROTIC FAIRIES Ur-epic, an original text from which all Celtic mythology derived', Gerry Smyth comments that 'sometimes, indeed, the land itself becomes an ideal image of the epic - in the words of the poet Seamus Heaney, a sort of manuscript which Irish people have lost the skill to read'; but, we may add, a skill that nationalist culture pretends to be capable of restoring.69 We should not forget, however, that ideas of modern Republicanism are Enlightenment ideas, the kind disseminated by the colonizer, although reassembled creatively by the scholarly Irish nationalist organisations.70 The nationalist elite glorified the perceived relationship between women's bodies and the body of nature, but at the same time, in the spirit of Enlightenment ideals, they purified, sanitized, and idealized it.71 Thus, representations of the relationship between women and nature in late nineteenth-century Ireland intertwine folk-tales with colonial and nationalist discourses. Strategies of colonial surveillance of the landscape and 'the informal regulatory rituals inherent in the society'72 co-operate in maintaining the otherness of nature and thus of women's bodies. Alternatively the relationship between women and nature envisioned in the Irish folkloric tradition was used in British and Irish circles to reinforce a vision of Ireland as an abject or as an idealized otherworld, a supplement (in the Derridean sense) of legitimate cultural spaces. Folk-tales, nationalist tales, and colonial tales share the desideratum of regulating women's bodies which may 'generate what is new, surprising, unpredictable'73 and be potentially subversive of the masculine regime and social order. In order to contain such illegitimate transgressions, colonial discourse set up superstitious beliefs in fairies as signs of neuroses that extended from individual Irish people to Ireland as a body-politic. Bridget Cleary becomes a symbol/symptom of a neurotic society for the colonizer: her dead body stands as proof of a mindless nation; yet in court she is rescued as the pure angelic victim.74 Her pure soul is rescued by the severance of its ties with a monstrous body of nature, a body contiguous, for instance, with the 'body' of the Kylenagranagh ring fort that withholds secrets from the masculine gaze of the RIC. Bridget's dead body, now available for autopsy, can be seen as the site of an ideal spirit, because, unlike the rest of the 'living' Irish, it permits foreclosure (it is dead and not threatening to resurrect ungovernable nature) and inspection (the mind can be satisfied that nature remains outside the metropolis, yet available for probing and surveillance).75 On the other hand, traditional Irish beliefs, anchored in the discourse of fairy-legends, also repudiate the feminine body of nature in order to legitimate the shape of the patriarchal body-politic of the community. 507</page><page sequence="17">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW The mound at Kylenagranagh is feared and respected as a feminine otherworld, yet it is desirable that its power does not interfere with the arrangements of the mortals. Thus, in spite of the fact that folklore readings of women's bodies through the symbolism associated with nature seem to offer unique opportunities for constructing women through empowering social imaginaries, that is, by viewing them as other than just wives or domestic labourers, these possibilities are often evoked as deviations from the 'normal' course of community life. In his study of new Irish fiction Gerry Smyth finds that its defining feature is an impetus to 'challenge established notions regarding the limits and possibilities of Irish identity.'76 This seems to be also the purpose of Bourke's study and the vision of her short stories. Bourke's documentary of the Cleary case indicates that social imaginaries are possible that represent women's control of their bodies and their sharing in the governance of the communities' social spaces. The source of these social imaginaries can be traced to the ethos of women's alliance with an ungovernable realm of nature. Bridget Cleary was able to use this ethos to her advantage, without being less rational or social than the husband who eventually punished her for her independence. Bourke offers evidence that 'Bridget Cleary, well versed in fairy-lore, would have found in its stories a language through which to resist her husband's negative assessment of her ... [A] wife who could persuade a violent husband that she was a fairy changeling' could exercise a degree of control over his behaviour; all the more so in Bridget's case, since she 'may have taken on some of her mother's role, as possessor of esoteric knowledge, in a way that made her husband nervous.'77 According to Bourke: Fairies belong to the margins, and so can serve as reference points and metaphors for all that is marginal in human life. Their underground existence allows them to stand for the unconscious, for the secret or the unspeakable ....78 In a sense, then, it can be said that Bridget Cleary used the ethos of Irish folk-tales as 'a place from which to speak about [her] own speechlessness', to apply Marina Warner's comments on the role of women in transmitting fairy-tales in general.79 Such use of the Irish mythological tradition involves a challenging of the dominance of the masculine subject who speaks the truths that ward off the unspeakable deeds of the body. Because of that, it also involves a challenge to both Irish nationalist and colonial discourses that idealize or abject, and thus variously other, the fantasy of the body permitted in folk-tales, in which 508</page><page sequence="18">OTHERWORLDLY WOMEN AND NEUROTIC FAIRIES women's associations with nature may be envisioned in empowering, productive ways. These concerns are reflected in Bourke's collection of short stories, where she experiments with the metaphorical valences that tie individuals' bodies to the body of nature. In her literary writing, Bourke is concerned with cultural sites that mythologize the relationship between women and nature. These sites can be the setting of the most casual activities deriving from material practices characteristic of male-dominated gender regimes. In 'Dreams of Sailing', exploring the thoughts of a young woman whose summer love adventure is the occasion of her sexual initiation, the narrator shows how gender hierarchies are instilled in the most simple practices, such as sailing a boat for leisure: while her lover, Kevin, is guiding the boat, the woman's role is to 'lean in or out to balance us',80 just as she would be expected to do as wife. Kevin refers to the boat as a 'she' and finds it 'so responsive', governable.81 He reads the body of his lover through his fantasy about boats. When on one of their forays the boat is about to capsize, the woman falls into the sea, and, as if awakened from a spell, she becomes aware of the phallic geometry of Kevin's fantasy. The scene is loaded with sexual connotations: Kevin managed to do something with his feet ... and up she came. The mast and the sail came swinging up against the blue sky, with the sun shining on all the drops of water as they poured off. It looked so beautiful and geometric, very high and white and far away.82 Eventually, after Kevin abandons her at the end of the summer, the woman realizes that the boat 'was really only made for one person'.83 We may interpret this story using Foucault's argument that 'the body becomes a useful force only if it is both a productive body and a subjected body.'84 Foucault speaks here of the body as a labour resource. In the situation narrated in Bourke's story the young woman's body is seen as a source of pleasure. However, her body is read through an association with nature that we glimpse indirectly through the rich tradition of Irish tales concerning fishing labour that has lent its worldview to the practice of leisure sailing. Regarding nature as a productive body, the Irish cultural tradition of fishing practices endorses nature's subjection. This masculine control of nature also legitimates the appropriation of women's bodies. Bourke's story entitled 'Pinkeens' also explores how the masculine dominance of nature is reflected in socialization skills and leads to forms of eroticism in which women are abused. The narrator, a pre 509</page><page sequence="19">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW sexual girl, is puzzled by the groups of young men whom she sees going fishing every day during the summer. When her older cousin is sent over for the holidays, the two girls are finally allowed to go fishing themselves, on their own. One of the boys offers to show them a place where there would be more fish. When the three get there, he leads the girls to the edge of the water saying 'You have to be very quiet and not move.' ... He stood behind us ... put his hand on my shoulder and made me lean against him. He was pointing at the water but I couldn't see anything. He kept saying 'Ssh!' and then he said 'There they are!' but he was rubbing my leg with his thumb. It rubbed softly at first, but then really hard, right up inside my shorts. ... I was afraid to move.85 The passage suggests that the male reads the girl's body as he reads nature: a body in which to fish. The story emphasizes the symbolic value of apparently insignificant gestures and phrases to show how they reflect the disciplining of women's bodies as resources for masculine sexual pleasure, just as nature is a resource for the practice of masculine skills. Later, when the two girls return home they carry 'jamjars ... full of fish' but they 'had to walk very slowly so the water wouldn't splash out.'86 The text suggests that the girls are 'training' for pregnancy, a reading strengthened by the narrator's relating the two experiences through underlining the discomfort they caused: Tt was the second time I couldn't move because of the stupid pinkeens.'87 Eventually, the girl decides to empty the jar on the ground and kill the fish. When in the evening her parents ask what she had caught, the girl's reply foreshadows a rejection of social norms that confine women as fertile nature to domestic maternal roles: '"What about you, Una? Did you not catch any pinkeens?" "I did," I said, "I got a whole lot, but I didn't want to carry them.'"88 Thus, in her short stories as well as in her study of Bridget Cleary's case, Angela Bourke is preoccupied with the empowering as well as with the disempowering ways in which the association between women and nature is represented. Bourke's critical vision conceives of culture as a continuum in which notions of the body, nature, and the body politic are continuously renegotiated.89 In the story closing Bourke's collection, 'Mayonnaise to the Hills', two women, Lucy and Eithne, discuss the relationship between women and nature. Eithne initiates Lucy into the intimate connection between femininity and nature thus: 510</page><page sequence="20">OTHERWORLDLY WOMEN AND NEUROTIC FAIRIES 'Yes. Hills are breasts, and the earth is a woman, and a woman is the earth and all that crap.' Tt's a bit pathetic though, isn't it?' 'Well, it is. But what I'm trying to say is I think landscape turns everyone on. Or it can ? but men think sex belongs to them ... But the thing is, it's me with the land, not me as the land. ... I just feel alive when I come down here. I walk along the road and smell the turf smoke and the salty air and I want to open my mouth and my nose wider and wider to take it in. And then at night the sky is so clean. You feel if you could open wide enough you could swallow the stars. That's what sex is about after all, isn't it? Feeling everything waking up?'90 The relationship between women's bodies and nature envisioned here is one of re-appropriation rather than of incorporation. Eithne is allied with nature; she is not taken over by it. In using the Irish folklore tradition to her advantage, Bridget Cleary envisioned an alliance of women with the land, through which she could oppose her husband's incorporative vision of her as a territory to which he could stake a claim. Irish folkloric discourses offer at least these two possible ways of envisioning women's relationship with nature. In highlighting these possibilities, Bourke's writing underscores the heteroglossic play which the discourses can accommodate. This suggests that the social norms established by the discourses depend on which aspects of the relationship between women and nature are being reiterated until they become naturalized features of bodies and landscapes. Bourke's study of the Cleary case points out that the patriarchal impetus of male generated social myths in nineteenth-century Ireland resulted from overlapping and disjunctive discourses that emerged in the interaction between Irish rural, Irish nationalist, and British metropolitan cultures. In this context, heteroglossia can be seen as an important concern of Irish women's writing. It can be used to open up various mutually reinforcing social myths that corroborate male-dominated gender regimes through reiterating the otherness of women and landscape. The analysis of Bridget Cleary's case serves as an example of how voices from the past are inflected by the specific contexts of Irish culture, as well as offering the opportunity to examine how women's bodies are affected by the disciplinary discourses of intersecting traditions. The body functions like a prism that reflects and refracts the myths through which nature and society are constituted as habitable or uninhabitable places. 511</page><page sequence="21">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW NOTES 1.

Fairies steal humans (usually children) and leave a changeling in their stead. As Bourke points out, records of many such cases exist in Ireland in which rituals were performed on children thought to be changelings in order to bring back the 'real' children from the fairy world. Instances of such rituals being performed on adults are less numerous. Bridget Cleary's fate is the only one in which burning is involved.

The Burning of Bridget Cleary, p.175. A more ambiguous treatment of associations between women and nature is encountered in the banshee tradition. Patricia Lysaght traces the banshee figure of Irish folklore tradition to the figures of the sovereignty goddesses who are one with the land, and to the fairy women figures inhabiting fairy mounds. Lysaght points out that the tradition teaches that insulted banshees may be vengeful, and therefore it 'warns against being out late hours and indecorous behaviour towards women/ However, it is difficult to say to what extent the banshee tradition protects women while also legitimating their confinement to domestic tasks (the banshee is often found beetling at the river). The tradition of Badb, the Irish war goddess in Celtic Ireland, although discernible in the banshee tradition, has not been preserved. All that has been preserved of the sovereignty goddess tradition is the idea that a family who has a banshee is an illustrious family.

This discourse of a representative of British authority can be seen as an example of how metropolitan discourses sanitized and abjected Ireland through using idealized representations of women, while also appealing to the feelings of the Irish bourgeois class.
