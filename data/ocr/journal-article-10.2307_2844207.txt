<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Place of 'Peoples' in Prehistoric Research* IRVING ROUSE PREHISTORIANS ARE REGIONAL SPECIALISTS. Our discipline is so broad that none of us can, in his own research, encompass the whole field. The specialists in each region have tended to develop somewhat different aims, for their data lead them in different directions. Specialists in Polynesia, for example, are preoccupied with problems of migration, since the people of that area were great canoeists and moved from island to island. By contrast, specialists in the prehistory of the Near East have devoted little attention to migrations. Their main concern is with the rise of civilization, since this was the most important event in their region. Each group of regional specialists has worked out its own methods of achieving its aims. Many have developed their own peculiar terminologies, examples of which will be given below. These regional differences are intensified by the tendency of palaeo- lithic and protohistoric specialists to work in relative isolation. The differences are as true of the New World as of the Old. For example, Willey &amp; Phillips's recent book on Method and Theory in American Archaeology (I958) reflects the procedure and terminology which its authors use in their own specialities, the proto- history of Nuclear America and of the south-eastern United States. Different terms and different methods are used by the specialists in Palaeo-Indian archaeology and in the protohistory of other parts of the New World, such as the mid-western United States on the one hand, and California on the other (Heizer I959). Nevertheless, if one surveys the entire range of methods in the New World and compares it with the range of methods in the Old World, as my visit to England is giving me the opportunity to do, one finds that they are alike. This has surprised me. Before coming here, I had assumed that there were significant differences between the methodology of the two hemispheres, but I have encountered British counterparts for almost all we do in America and vice versa. Personally, I find this most encouraging. Not only does it indicate that we should eventually be able to develop a single, unified discipline of prehistory, covering the whole world, but also it is a sign that prehistorians in both hemispheres are on the right track; if we were not, we could hardly have developed similar methods while working in relative isolation. We cannot, however, hope to become a unified discipline until we have achieved a greater measure of agreement about our concepts and about the terms we use for them. The current variety of terms has been particularly troublesome to me because I am working on a synthesis of world prehistory. It has been necessary for me to devise a special terminology for this purpose, encompassing in so far as possible all the regional variations. I present this terminology here, and shall attempt to show how it fits into the trends of prehistoric research in both Old and New Worlds, in the hope of pointing the way towards greater uniformity within our discipline. I</page><page sequence="2">2 IRVING ROUSE My terminology is based upon an assumption that the study of people is basic to prehistory, as it is to all other branches of anthropology. The first piehistorians, to be sure, were simply collectors of artifacts, but we have long since passed beyond this stage. We now dig sites not only to obtain artifacts but to learn all we can about the peoples who lived in the sites. Following Childe (I956), I would suggest that we ask four main questions about each people: (i) who were they, (2) when did they live, (3) what culture did they have, and (4) how did that culture change? I shall discuss these four questions in turn. I. WHO WERE THE PEOPLE? According to Childe (I956, p. 28), interest in the question 'who?' first arose on the continent of Europe towards the close of the last century. Childe attributed its develop- ment to the rise of nationalism, and certainly this was true in Germany where Kossina (I920), for example, attempted to identify the prehistoric ancestors of the German people. Comparing the collections from different sites, he found that many of them were characterized by similar traits, which he took to be evidence of habitation by Germans. The interest in peoples assumed a somewhat different form as it spread from Germany to Great Britain. It had been easy enough for the Germans to trace them- selves back into the past, because their country has a relatively homogeneous popula- tion. But it would not have been possible for the British prehistorians to do the same thing because their origin is too diverse. Too many different prehistoric peoples have fused to produce the historic British people. Moreover, British prehistorians have always been as interested in palaeolithic as in later time, and it would obviously have been impossible to trace any historic people as far back as the palaeolithic. Hence, the British focused their attention not upon the historic peoples and their antecedents but upon the recurrent traits by means of which the Germans had traced themselves back into prehistory. The British used these traits to distinguish entirely new groupings of people, which were peculiar to prehistory. Childe's The Danube in Prehistory (I929) provides a good example of this. Childe was able to treat some of his sites as single units but had to break others down into several components, each characterized by a different assemblage of artifacts. At the site of Vinca near Belgrade, for example, he marked off the bottom metre of the deposit as a single component, which he called Vinca I (ChiJde I929, figs. 9-i2). This component was characterized by jars with anthropomorphic lids, curvilinear incised designs, female clay figurines, etc. Childe found that these same traits occurred in components of other sites, grouped all such components with Vinca I, and named the group Vinca I after the type component. He then proceeded to discuss the culture of the group, which he likewise called Vin6a I (Childe I929, pp. 26-7). In effect, Childe started out to answer my first question 'who?', but did not work all the way through to the answer. After having classified the components, he assumed the answer to the first question and shifted to the third, 'what culture did the people have?'. In order properly to answer the first question, he would have had to apply the name 'Vinca I' to the people of the components as well as to their culture, and would have had to specify which traits are diagnostic of the Vinca I people. The diagnostic</page><page sequence="3">THE PLACE OF 'PEOPLES IN PREHISTORIC RESEARCH 3 traits would have comprised a complex considerably smaller in scope than the Vinca I culture. Childe (I956, pp. I5, 173) termed his procedure 'chorological classification'. He adopted the word 'chorology' from Menghin (I93I, p. 7), though he deplored its ugliness. It is not very appropriate either. Chorology means the study of geographical distributions and Menghin used it because he and Kossina had relied upon the geo- graphical distribution of traits in defining their peoples. But this was not true of Childe. If he had carried through to definition of the Vinca I people, for example, he would have based that definition on the recurrence of diagnostic cultural traits in a number of components. In effect, he would have defined the people in terms of these traits. It is appropriate, therefore, to call his procedure 'ethnic classification'. We have seen that ethnic classification began in Europe around the turn of the century. American prehistorians did not become interested in it until the I930's. Then, it developed in two forms, one in the south-western United States (e.g. the Gladwins I934) and the other in the mid-western part of the country (e.g. McKern I939). The south-western approach resembled the original German development, in that it aimed to trace the historic Amerindian peoples back into the past. Hence, it has limited applicability, as in the case of Germany. It can only be applied to late protohistoric peoples and under exceptionally favourable circumstances, which happen to exist in the south-west. The mid-western approach, on the other hand, resembles that which developed in Britain. Like Childe, the mid-westerners set out to define purely pre- historic units. As a result, their approach has more general applicability and is worth considering in more detail. Mid-western prehistorians became interested in peoples because of the presence in their area of large mounds and the prevalence of a belief that these mounds had been built by a different and more advanced people than the American Indians, who were popularly called 'the Mound Builders'. Many early writers, including a former president of my university (Stiles I933, p. ioi), believed that the Mound Builders were descended, from the Phoenicians, the Israelites, or some other people of antiquity. Mid-western prehistorians had to spend much time in refuting this belief, which they did by excavating mounds and showing that they contain artifacts comparable to those of the modern American Indians. Eventually it became apparent that several groups of American Indians were involved in the construction of the mounds. The mounds are so variable in structure and content that they cannot all have been produced by the same people. So the problem arose of distinguishing various groups of mound-building Indians. Mid-western prehistorians first attempted to solve this problem by the use of chorological classification, in the Kossina-Menghin sense of the term. They studied the distribution of traits from mound to mound, in the hope of being able to distinguish geographical groupings of people. This study, however, failed to reveal any consistent patterning of traits. The reason was soon recognized: the peoples who produced the mounds had lived at different times and had overlapped in geographical distribution. The overlaps were obscuring the boundaries between the peoples. One way out of this difficulty would have been to set up periods and to study the geographical distribution of the peoples period by period. However, the mid-westerners</page><page sequence="4">4 IRVING ROUSE had spent so much time on the problem of defining the peoples, i.e. in answering the first question I have posed, that they had not yet been able to do anything with the second question, 'when did the people live?'. Therefore, they decided to disregard both temporal and spatial distributions and to define their peoples purely in terms of cultural traits, i.e. by means of ethnic classification. The method they developed has become known as the mid-western taxonomic system (McKern I939). It was in two parts, only the first of which is comparable to the British approach. In this first part, the mid-westerners isolated components and classified them in terms of traits. Like Childe, they did not distinguish, as I am doing, between a people and its culture. They simply applied the name of a type site to the culture of each group of components, and called this culture a 'focus'. But they did recognize that they had not based their definition of a focus on all of its traits; they referred to the traits diagnostic of each focus as its 'determinants'. With the components and foci as a base, the mid-westerners went on to erect a superstructure consisting of aspects, phases, and patterns (e.g. Wilford I94I, table i). These were hierarchic units and, like the foci, were based solely upon similarities and differences between the foci, not upon geographical or chronological distinctions. Foci which shared most of their determinants were grouped into a single aspect; aspects which shared most of their diagnostic traits were grouped into the same phase; and phases which shared most of their diagnostics were placed in the same patterns. This superstructure of aspects, phases, and patterns was considered a temporary expedient. It was designed to serve as a sort of filing system within which to organize the various foci until such time as it should become possible to arrange them in chrono- logical order. After the Second World War, a chronology was set up, the superstructure was then abandoned, and the foci were arranged in their proper chronological and geographical order (e.g. Griffin I952, fig. 205). The only traces of the taxonomic superstructure which survive are the names of the three patterns, Archaic, Woodland, and Mississippi, which now serve to designate periods. The basic part of the mid-western system has spread westward to the prehistorians specializing in the plains of the west-central United States, eastward as far as New England, and southward to the Caribbean region, in which I specialize. In my own New England research, I have retained the mid-western terminology, in accordance with local practice, but have modified it in the Caribbean region. There, Cruxent and I have substituted the terms 'complex' and 'style' for 'focus', since our data are not sufficient to reveal the total culture of the components. We have set up chronologies of complexes and styles, which are equivalent both to the mid-western sequences of foci and to the chronology of cultures established by Childe for the Danubian region (cf. Rouse &amp; Cruxent I963, fig. 3; Griffin 1952; and Childe 1929, table opp. p. 418). But I am getting ahead of the argument. We are concerned at this point not with the question of when each people lived but with the question of who they were. Our problem is how to define peoples. We have seen that most British prehistorians do so by setting up 'cultures' and most Americans, by working out 'foci' (alternatively called 'phases' or 'facies'; Heizer I959). Cruxent and I substituted the terms 'complex' and 'style' for 'focus' because we wished to make it clear that we have been unable, for lack of evidence, to define our peoples in terms of their total cultures and have had to</page><page sequence="5">THE 'PLACE OF 'PEOPLES IN PREHISTORIC RESEARCH 5 work instead with complexes of stone, bone, and shell artifacts, in the case of non- ceramic peoples, and with pottery styles, in the case of ceramic peoples. In this, we have followed the lead of the Palaeo-Indian and Peruvian specialists respectively (Rouse &amp; Cruxent I963, p. I6). Alternatively, we might have used the terms 'industry' and 'assemblage', which are preferred by the Old World prehistorians who lack sufficient evidence to work with full configurations of culture (Piggott I959, p. 87). Reviewing the terminology of Cruxent and myself since arriving in Britain, I have come to believe that we were wrong in assuming that any prehistorian uses total cultural configurations to define peoples. For one thing, it is not possible to know the total culture of any prehistoric people; one can only expect to obtain more or less information about those aspects of each culture which have been preserved in the form of remains or which can be inferred from the remains (e.g. Childe I956, pp. I I8-28). For another thing, I doubt whether, when one classifies sites in order to distinguish peoples, one ever uses all the available cultural information. The mid-western taxo- nomists recognized this when they distinguished between a focus and its determinants. Kluckhohn (i962 pp. 75-6) has independently expressed the same point as follows: 'Observation of the actual operation of archaeologists suggests that in many cases the classification of sites is actually made on the basis of pottery complex or architectural style (including masonry type). If this fact is explicitly stated, the procedure may well be the most convenient and quite unobjectionable. If, however, there is assertion or implication that the classification has been made on the basis of the total cultural complex, this is misleading, for what occurs is that other cultural elements found associated with the critical pottery complex or architectural style are simply dragged in after the crucial step has been taken. If we are really operating with pottery or masonry-architectural complexes (or a combination of these two) only, it would be in the interests of clear thinking to bring this circumstance into the open, either through terminology or explicit statement. It seems possible that classificatory operations based solely upon these apparently somewhat more sensitive and more consistent criteria would be the most useful. The associated culture elements (not used in cultural classification) could then be studied apart from the prejudice of a question-begging nomenclature, and, after the trends toward uniformity had been unequivocally ascer- tained, the operations for definitions in terms of total culture ... could be rigorously set up.' Kluckhohn was referring in this passage to the protohistory of the south- western United States, but his words would apply equally well to the protohistory of other areas, such as the Near East (e.g. Braidwood I952, figs. 26-7). In the passage quoted, Kluckhohn has, in effect, recognized the need to distinguish between my questions 'who?' and 'what?', but has not expressed this need in terms of the concept of 'peoples'. Reformulating his statement in these terms, I would say we ought to recognize that we are primarily concerned with peoples, that we define each people by establishing a 'complex' of its traits, and that each complex comprises only a small part of the people's 'culture'. In some cases, we are able to learn little more about a people's culture than its complex; in others, we recover information about many additional aspects of the culture; but in no case are we able to reconstruct the entire culture of a prehistoric people. In summary, I would suggest that the procedure of distinguishing peoples be</page><page sequence="6">6 IRVING ROUSE termed 'ethnic classification'. The traits diagnostic of each people may similarly be called an 'ethnic complex' in order to avoid confusion with burial or religious com- plexes, for example. The procedure of ethnic classification is as follows: First, each site must be broken down into components, as is currently the practice in both Europe and America. If the site has yielded a homogeneous assemblage of artifacts, it should be treated as a single component, but if not, it will have to be divided into several different components, each with its own homogeneous assemblage. All components that have yielded similar assemblages are grouped together. Each group is defined by listing its distinctive traits and is given the name of a typical site. The name applies not only to the group of components but also to the traits which charac- terize it and to the people who lived in the components. The traits constitute a complex which is indicative of the people. Whenever one discovers a new site, one can identify the people who lived there simply by determining which complex it contains. The crucial part of this procedure is the selection of the traits to be used in setting up complexes. In actual practice, as I have observed it, each investigator selects the traits which best enable him to classify his components and thereby to distinguish peoples. He must choose traits which occur in all the components, or else he will not be able to include all components within the classification; traits which are relatively frequent, or else the classification will not be reliable; and traits which were significant to the people, or else he will be unable adequately to distinguish peoples. Chipped stone artifacts best meet these requirements in the case of palaeolithic and Palaeo- Indian remains, and pottery in the case of neolithic and Neo-Indian remains, but there are exceptions. Specialists in Eskimo prehistory have come to rely primarily upon harpoon heads, and Polynesian specialists, upon fish hooks or adzes. In some areas, the traits are obtained from refuse deposits and in others, from graves. In my opinion, it does not matter what sort of traits or what kinds of materials one uses to classify one's components, providing that these traits and materials do the job they are supposed to do: permit one to distinguish peoples and to identify additional settlements (components) of each people as they are found. In my country, prehistorians are criticized, even by some colleagues (e.g. Taylor 1948), because we devote so much effort to chipped stonework and potsherds. I do not believe it is sufficiently realized that these bits of artifacts do not interest us for their own sake but because they provide us with a means of identifying peoples. We have not made it clear that we must study the stones and potsherds in order to define ethnic groups. 2. WHEN DID EACH PEOPLE LIVE? Interest in the question 'when?' arose long before anyone had become concerned about the first question 'who?'. Not only classical Greek and Roman writers but also a contemporary Chinese scholar speculated that there had been a sequence of stone, bronze, and iron ages (Chang I963, p. 2). This theory was revived during the Renais- sance and was documented archaeologically by the Danes Thomsen and Worsaae in the first half of the nineteenth century (Daniel I943). When the three-age system, as the stone-bronze-iron sequence is called, was first established, it was assumed to be world-wide. Subsequent research has shown that it is</page><page sequence="7">THE PLACE OF 'PEOPLES IN PREHISTORIC RESEARCH 7 applicable only to certain regions, such as Scandinavia. Prehistorians in other parts of the world have had to construct their own regional chronologies. Both in the Old and New Worlds, this process began immediately after the First World War. Childe's Danubian chronology, already mentioned, was one of the first in the eastern hemi- sphere. The first in the western hemisphere was the so-called Pecos classification, set up in the south-western United States in I927 (e.g. Rouse I962, p. 36). The original three-age system had a second feature which I find objectionable. It is defined in terms of individual artifact types and not of cultures or peoples. As the system subsequently gave way to a series of regional chronologies, there was a tendency to shift from artifacts to cultures. I have already illustrated this trend in my discussion of Childe's chronology and of the one set up by the mid-western taxonomists; it is also true of current usages of the Pecos classification in the south-west. But the trend has not been universal. In England, for example, Hawkes (I959, fig. 2) has subdivided the Iron Age by studying the distribution of individual types of artifacts, rather than cultures. Specialists in the prehistory of the south-eastern United States use a similar approach and object to -the practice of mid-westerners and south-westerners in basing their chronologies upon foci, i.e. upon cultures. The research of James A. Ford (I962), a leading south-eastern prehistorian, will serve to illustrate this point. Ford works solely with types of pottery. He divides his region of study into local areas and collects potsherds from the surfaces of as many sites as possible in each area. He seriates the collections from each area in terms of their pottery types, thus producing a number of local sequences, each of which he proceeds to divide into units he calls 'periods' (e.g. Ford &amp; Willey I949, fig. 4). Then he synchronizes the 'periods' of each local area in order to form a regional chronology. In the terminology I am using here, each of Ford's local 'periods' corresponds to a culture, but not to the culture of a single people. Instead, it refers to the culture of a single area and period. Ford's approach does not allow for the possibility that two peoples may have lived side by side in the same area and period, or that a people may have lived in more than one area or period (Rouse I955, fig. 2). Hence, I do not believe that his approach can give an, accurate picture of prehistory. Indeed, I would suggest that the approach to chronology in terms of individual types of artifacts is an anachronism-a survival of the time when prehistorians were simply collectors of artifacts. If it is true, as I stated at the beginning, that we have moved on from the study of artifacts per se to focus upon the people who made the artifacts, we ought to base our chronologies upon peoples and not upon artifacts. In my -opinion, Childe, his European colleagues, the mid-western taxonomists, and the specialists in south-western prehistory, all took a step in the right direction when they based their regional chronologies upon cultures rather than upon artifacts. But I would go one step further and substitute peoples for cultures. It seems to me logical to date the peoples before working out their cultures. In fact, I do not believe that one can properly reconstruct a people's culture until one has determined when and where the people lived, for one will not be able to understand the culture until one has acquired some knowledge of its physical and cultural environment. I doubt that a historian would discuss a people's culture without first informing himself about the period in which the people lived. Why should a prehistorian do so?</page><page sequence="8">8 IRVING ROUSE The proposed shift in the construction of chronologies from cultures to people is largely a matter of terminology. It requires one to work in terms of complexes rather than cultures, but most of us already do this. The procedure is as follows. First, one delimits the region and time to be studied (Rouse I957, fig. i). Next, one divides the region into areas. One arranges the complexes of each area, and hence its peoples, in chronological order by use of the standard techniques such as stratigraphy, seriation, and radiocarbon dating, thereby producing local sequences of peoples. One determines which peoples in each sequence were contemporaneous by a study of trade sherds and other evidences of relative age. Then, one enters the sequences in a chronological chart, one to a column, placing all the contemporaneous peoples on the same level within their respective columns. One divides the chart into periods by drawing horizontal lines between the levels, i.e. between each group of contemporaneous peoples. Comparing the peoples' complexes within each period, one will find that they share a number of traits, which may be regarded as time-markers for the period. When new peoples are discovered, they can be dated simply by determining which time-markers are present in their complexes. 3. WHAT CULTURE DID THE PEOPLE HAVE? It did not take the early prehistorians long to develop an interest in the life of pre- historic time. When, for example, Lord Avebury wrote his pioneer synthesis of prehistory in I865, he included three chapters on 'Modern Savages' in order, as he put it, to 'throw light on the ancient remains found in Europe, and on the condition of the early races which inhabited our continent' (Avebury I900, p. 408). Subsequently, Sollas (i9ii) juxtaposed chapters on Eoliths and Tasmanians, Middle Palaeolithic and Australian aborigines, Aurignacian and Bushman, and Magdalenian and Eskimos, thus using the cultures of modern peoples to illustrate life during various periods in the three-age system. As the three-age system gave way to regional chronologies, it became necessary for British prehistorians to use other frames of reference in reconstructing the lives of prehistoric peoples. Some began to study the culture of each region during a particular period of time, but this has not proved to be very satisfactory, because there is too much variation in culture from one part of a region to another (Jope I963). Others have analysed the development of different aspects of culture from one period to another (e.g. Clark I940, I952). This is a fruitful approach, but has the disadvantage that it fails to reveal the interrelationships between various aspects of culture within single societies. Probably for this reason, the current trend is to study individual societies, i.e. 'cultures' (Childe I95I, pp. 30-53; Piggott I959, pp. 8o-ioo). In the terminology of the present paper, this means (i) defining a people in terms of its diagnostic traits of material culture, (2) dating the people's remains, and (3) recon- structing as much as possible of the rest of the people's culture. Jt is this third step in the procedure-answering my question 'what'-that concerns us here. In answering the question 'what?', British prehistorians no longer rely, as Lord Avebury and Sollas did, upon vague general analogies to modern primitive peoples. Instead, they focus on the remains of a particular prehistoric people ('culture') and draw inferences from those remains, with the help of specific analogies to European</page><page sequence="9">THE PLACE OF 'PEOPLES IN PREHISTORIC RESEARCH 9 folk customs and to the cultures of comparable people living in other parts of the world (Clark I951). Documentary evidence and place-names have also been used to interpret the remains of the latest protohistoric peoples (Wainwright I962). Interest in the reconstruction of culture arose in the United States about the same time as in Britain, but in a very different manner. There was no need for americanists to draw general analogies to modern primitive peoples, as Lord Avebury and Sollas were doing. Many American Indian tribes still retained their aboriginal cultures, and it was only necessary to project these cultures into the past by identifying sites occupied by the ancestors of the modern Indians. In this way, American prehistorians were able to produce a number of 'prehistoric ethnologies', as they were sometimes called (e.g. Smith I9IO). Recently, there has been a tendency to substitute the term 'anthropology' for 'ethnology' in this connexion. The reason, I suspect, is that American prehistorians have always maintained a closer professional association with cultural, linguistic, and physical anthropologists than is the case in Britain. We have come to feel we must justify this association by reconstructing the entire anthropology of our sites-their cultures, physical traits, and languages-instead of limiting ourselves to the relatively few traits utilized in ethnic classification and in the construction of chronologies (Taylor I 948; Binford I 962). Until the 1930's, it was the practice to reconstruct the cultures-and, where possible, the races and languages-of individual sites. With the establishment of the mid-western taxonomic system and other methods of ethnic classification, americanists began to reconstruct the cultures of peoples ('foci') rather than sites. This was a great improvement, since it meant that each reconstruction no longer had to be based upon the evidence from only a single site. One could dig a number of sites belonging to the same people, put the evidence from all of them together, and be reasonably sure that, in so doing, one was dealing with the same culture. The digging of additional sites offered four advantages: (i) It enabled one to obtain rare artifacts which had not turned up in the original excavation. (2) It provided the opportunity to search for conditions under which perishable objects have been pre- served. (3) It also became possible to utilize alternative techniques of excavation. In digging to define a people or to construct a chronology, for example, one normally employs stratigraphic techniques. Subsequently, it may be necessary to move to other sites in order to apply different techniques which better reveal structures and burials. (4) New sites may also provide evidence about activities not carried on at the site originally excavated. In regions where the original excavations were in burial mounds, for example, it has been necessary to move on to dwelling sites, and vice versa. Up to this point, I have been discussing simple peoples, who were relatively self- contained. The digging of additional sites has proved to be even more necessary in the case of complex societies, comprising several peoples who lived side by side in a dependent relationship (Mayer-Oakes I963). The specialists in classic Maya civiliza- tion, for example, concentrated upon ceremonial centres during the time when they were primarily concerned with the question 'when?'. After turning to 'what?', they began to realize that the Maya actually consisted of two ethnic groups, the civilized</page><page sequence="10">IO IRVING ROUSE people who lived in the ceremonial centres and the peasants of the forests, who lacked monumental architecture, writing, astronomy, sculpture, and the other attributes of Maya civilization. They have had to supplement their research in the centres with excavation of the forest sites, in an effort to work out the peasant as well as the civilized culture (Willey I956, pp. I07-I4). To sum up, British and American prehistorians originally approached the problem of reconstructing culture in very different ways. The British drew vague, general analogies, whereas Americans were able to project the cultures of historic Indian peoples back to individual prehistoric sites. From these separate beginnings, both the British and the Americans seem to be trending in the same direction, towards recon- struction of the cultures of specific groups of people, distinguished by means of ethnic classification. The procedure may be summarized as follows: The aim is to reconstruct all aspects of a people's culture, material, social, and mental. As I have already indicated, a fuller picture of the material culture, beyond the people's diagnostic complex, may be obtained by digging widely in search of rare types of artifacts, especially in sites where perishable materials have been preserved (e.g. Clark I939, pp. 50-85). Social culture may be reconstructed by investigating the loci in which a people carried on each of its activities, e.g. eating, sleeping, the manu- facture of artifacts, and burial. Examination of the artifacts and other debris of each locus will reveal much about the activities that took place there. Study of the relation- ships among the loci, which may be called the 'settlement pattern', provides information concerning the people's ecology and social structure (Sears I96I). Something can be learned about the people's mental culture by studying its art; design motifs, for example, provide clues as to deities (e.g. Ucko I962). These procedures require two kinds of reasoning: inference from the remains and the drawing of analogies to present-day conditions (Thompson I956). In reasoning by analogy, one must resist the temptation to go farther than the available evidence permits, but one may go quite far, especially in the study of economic life, by the use of direct historic analogy, in which one projects a particular people's culture back into its own prehistoric sites (Tax et al. I953, pp. 250-4). One has to be more cautious in reasoning by analogy from one people to another (Ascher i96i). To a lesser extent, it is also possible to reconstruct a people's racial, political, and linguistic affiliations. Races can be inferred from the skeletal material found in the sites (e.g. Neumann 1952), and political or linguistic groupings can be projected back from historic time (e.g. Caldwell 1958, p. 4). The success of one's reconstruction will depend to a considerable extent upon how well one has defined the people and thereby delimited the culture to be reconstructed. It is essential to begin a tightly defined, local group of people, having so restricted a distribution in time and space as to eliminate the possibility of temporal and spatial variations. Only in this way can one be reasonably sure of dealing only with com- munities which had the same culture and the same tribal and linguistic affiliations. If, on the contrary, one defines a people broadly and loosely, one is liable to produce a grouping which is ethnically, politically, and linguistically so variable that one's reconstruction will be quite meaningless (e.g. Fairbanks 1952, pp. 294-8).</page><page sequence="11">THE PLACE OF 'PEOPLES IN PREHISTORIC RESEARCH II 4. HOW DID THE CULTURE CHANGE? Though prehistorians can and do study changes in race and language as well as in culture, I shall here limit myself to culture. Piggott (I960) has pointed out that the remains of material culture provide our best evidence of change. The most reliable results may be expected from the study of ethnic complexes, since these consist by definition of the most common and the most reliable traits available for study. Hence, I shall divide the following discussion into two parts, dealing respectively with (I) changes in ethnic complexes and (2) changes in the other aspects of culture associated with each complex, i.e. in the rest of a people's culture. (I) If the procedures outlined in the previous sections of this paper have been followed, each complex will be relatively uniform. Our problem, therefore, is not to study variations within complexes but to examine the changes that took place as one complex gave rise to another. Comparing one complex wvith another, one will find both similarities and differ- ences. The similarities are indicative of continuities between the complexes and the differences are an expression of change from complex to complex. Let us consider the continuities before examining the changes. It is not uncommon in both Old and New Worlds to refer to the continuities between complexes as 'traditions'. For example, palaeolithic specialists apply the phrase 'Mousterian of Acheulean tradition' to one of the Mousterian 'industries' in order to indicate that it was marked by a survival of the Acheulian-type hand axe, which the 'typical Mousterian' did not have (e.g. Bordes 1956, p. 5). Caldwell (1958, pp. 3-4) has similarly distinguished a series of 'regional traditions' in the eastern United States. Europeans think of traditions in terms of any continuity between complexes ('industries') but Americans tend to restrict the term to continuities between the complexes of single areas, as in the example given. This area restriction is most marked in the Peruvian field, where it is now customary to distinguish between 'tradition' and 'horizon', the former referring to the continuities of traits from one period to another within an area, and the latter to the continuities from one area to another within a period (Willey &amp; Phillips 1958, pp. 29-40). Working in Venezuela, Cruxent and I have combined the concepts of tradition and horizon in the European manner (Rouse &amp; Cruxent I963, pp. 23-6). We started by defining peoples and working out their chronology, as already explained. Then we compared the peoples' complexes and found that we were able to arrange them in lines of development, which we called 'series'. Each series shows a marked continuity of culture, like the traditions and horizons of Peruvian prehistory, but none is limited to a single area or period, as in Peru (Rouse &amp; Cruxent I963, e.g. fig. 28). Segments of certain series do constitute traditions or horizons in the peruvianist sense, but the entire series do not. Assuming that the same situation exists in Peru, I would suggest that the peruvianists have given us a somewhat distorted picture of the cultural con- tinuities in that region by distinguishing between the concepts of tradition and horizon. The procedure that Cruxent and I used was to compare the Venezuelan complexes in terms of their distributions within our chronological charts. Wherever we found a</page><page sequence="12">I2 IRVING ROUSE strong continuity of traits between two adjacent complexes, whether in the dimension of time or space, we concluded that the two belonged to the same series. Wherever we encountered a marked discontinuity, we assumed that the series had come to an end. We named each series by adding the suffix '-oid' to the name of a typical complex. For example, one series is called 'Saladoid' after its earliest known complex ('style'), which is Saladero. Having established series in this fashion, we proceeded to study the changes that had taken place from one complex to another within each series. We noted the principal changes and attempted to determine their causes: were they due to internal develop- ment (invention) or to acculturation under the influence of another people (diffusion)? We also attempted to show the extent to which each foreign trait had been modified to conform to the pre-existing native traits. We were prevented by paucity of data from carrying this approach very far except in the case of the Saladoid series, where we were able to produce a rather detailed picture of the changes in ceramic traits from one complex to another (Rouse &amp; Cruxent I963, pp. II6-25). It is, of course, not necessary to use series as the frame of reference in studying changes from complex to complex, as Cruxent and I did, but I believe it is more consistent with the nature of culture to do so. Culture is traditional and tends to resist change. If, therefore, one concentrates upon the changes from one complex to another without also studying instances of lack of change, one will acquire an incomplete picture of what has happened. For example, Childe's preoccupation with the spread of traits of Mediterranean civilization to the barbarians of central and northern Europe led him to overlook the purely local developments among the barbarians, until he finally became aware of the continuities in barbarian complexes that had survived in the face of Mediterranean influences (Childe I958, p. 74). (2) Turning now from changes in complexes to changes in the rest of the culture, we come to the subject which is customarily called 'cultural evolution'. British pre- historians have long been active in this field (e.g. Childe I950) but Americans have tended to shy away from it. Indeed, there was an implicit taboo against the subject in the United States during the period between the two World Wars. This, I believe, was due to a misunderstanding on our part about the nature of evolution. It was generally supposed at the time to have followed the same course throughout the world -to have been an absolute process that had affected all mankind in the same way, though to a differing extent in different parts of the world. We in America believed strongly in the relativity of culture and therefore could not accept this absolute theory of evolution. We knew, for example, that American Indian civilization had developed differently than European civilization, and we suspected that our own American civilization was likewise trending in a somewhat different direction. But instead of creating a new theory of evolution to account for the differences, we turned our backs on the subject and concluded that there has been no such thing as cultural evolution. With the revival of American interest in cultural evolution after the Second World War, Willey &amp; Phillips (1958, pp. 6I-78) set up a system of stages to express the development of the Amerindian civilizations. This system has the great merit of demon- strating that cultural evolution has proceeded rather differently in the New World than in the Old, but it has been criticized for failing to take into account differences</page><page sequence="13">THE PLACE OF 'PEOPLES IN PREHISTORIC RESEARCH 13 in evolution in various parts of the New World. Willey &amp; Phillips (I958, fig. 2) had assumed that the cultures of the peripheral parts of the New World were simply stagnant versions of the earliest cultures in the centres of civilizations, but this is not true. Instead, the peripheral cultures have developed in different directions than the central cultures. To correct the error, several authors (e.g. Braidwood I960, fig. I) have suggested setting up a separate system of stages for each region. Other writers (e.g. Hester i962, fig. 3) have thought it better to set up a different system for each kind of environment in the New World. I think myself that we would do better to create a separate system of stages for each series of peoples (Rouse I964). Systems of stages like this have already been set up in the south-western United States, one for the Anasazi series of peoples, a second for the Hohokam peoples, and a third for the Mogollon peoples; and they provide a good picture of the evolution of culture in that region (e.g. the Gladwins I934, final chart; Rouse I962, fig. 2). The south-western approach may be termed 'ethnic', since it is based upon peoples. Some may find it too specific, but it seems to me the only way to avoid ethno-centrism and to look at cultural change from a relative point of view. It is also more compatible than the general approach with the regional orientation of modern prehistory. It enables one to study cultural evolution in terms of the special conditions within each region, as well as those within each group of people, and thus to take into consideration all the factors which have affected cultural development. CONCLUSIONS This paper has been based upon an assumption that people are the proper subject of prehistoric research. I have suggested that we need to answer four main questions about them: who were they, when did they live, what cultures did they have, and how did the cultures change? The question 'who?' may be answered by means of ethnic classification, i.e. by grouping together sites or components of sites which have yielded similar assemblages of artifacts. The inhabitants of the components grouped together in this fashion may be termed a 'people' and may be defined by setting up a complex of diagnostic traits. The answer to the question 'when?' is obtained by construction of a regional chronology. The complexes of each local area, and through them, its peoples, are arranged in chronological order. The resultant sequences are synchronized in the form of a chronological chart, and this chart is divided into periods. The periods are defined by distinguishing 'time-markers', i.e. a number of traits which occur in all of a period's complexes and which therefore can be used to date its peoples. Part of the answer to the question 'what?' is supplied by the complexes. It is necessary to reconstruct the rest of each people's culture from its complex, much as a palaeontologist reconstructs the fleshy part of an extinct animal from its skeleton. This is done by inference from the remains and by the use of anthropological analogies. In some cases, it is also possible to project an historic people's culture, race, and language back to its prehistoric ancestors. For the answer to the question 'how?' one should study the continuities and changes in (i) the complexes and (2) the rest of peoples' cultures. I have cited the research of</page><page sequence="14">14 IRVING ROUSE Cruxent and myself in Venezuela to show that the complexes may be arranged in series, based upon their continuities, and that the changes may then be studied from complex to complex within each series. I have further suggested that the best way to examine changes in the rest of cultures, beyond the complexes, is to set up stages of development within each series. The four questions I have discussed are not the only ones that can be asked about prehistoric remains. For example, one may want to define religious instead of ethnic complexes, to map the geographic distribution of traits or complexes period by period, or to study changes in settlement patterns rather than in ethnic complexes. I would contend, though, that the four questions are basic to prehistoric research and that all other questions follow logically from them.
