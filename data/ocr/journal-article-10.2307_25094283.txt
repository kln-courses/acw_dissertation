<plain_text><page sequence="1">FERTILITY MYTH AND FEMALE SOVEREIGNTY IN THE WEDDYNGE OF SIR GAWENAND DAME RAGNELL by John Bugge Of the moste manlyest is oure desyre, To haue the souereynte of suche a syre, Suche is oure crafte and gynne. (428-30) The Weddynge of Sir Gawen and Dame Ragnell (hereafter Weddynge) is one of four main Middle English versions of the Loathly Lady story, the most familiar of which is the Wife of Bath's Tale.1 Of the four it best reveals beneath its literal surface the mythic substratum on which all of them ulti mately rest. Beginning more than a century ago, critics working in the tradition of comparative folklore identified that foundation as a fertility myth, Celtic in provenance but doubtless Neolithic in origin, involving the union of sun-god and earth-goddess to insure the fruitfulness of the land. Irish versions of the Loathly Lady story provide the earliest instan tiations of this myth in the British Isles, but there is more to their mean ing than just natural fecundity. In several tales the goddess is depicted as an ugly hag transformed into a beautiful lady in the sexual embrace of the hero destined to be king, their marital union enacting the solemn joining of the "territorial goddess," who represents, on the political level, the Sovereignty of Ireland (the flaitheas na h-Eirenn) with the land's right ful ruler.2 Such a political definition of sovereignty, however, is not part of the English versions; rather, as R. S. Loomis has noted, the Irish con cept of "?/?? Sovereignty," already several steps removed from the origi nating fertility myth, was in these Loathly Damsel stories further attenuated into a concept of sovereignty in the literal sense of competi tive mastery or dominance of one person by another.3 In effect, the woman who was "the Sovereignty" sought by Ireland's rulers now in the English stories seeks sovereignty from a male hero as a personal conces THE CHAUCER REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 2, 2004.

The story is both inverted and degraded into a conflict in the eter nal battle of the sexes. Most critical treatments of Weddynge have taken this latter reading of sovereignty as their starting point. Having a very different definition in mind here, I avoid direct engagement with much of this critical work, however useful it has been on such issues as the poem's possible author ship,4 its relationship to oral literature,5 its relationship to its analogues,6 or its relevance to fifteenth-century social concerns and legal theory.7 While such efforts deserve credit for contextualizing the poem's concerns in a contemporary cultural setting (and admittedly what I plan here has a similar purpose), I would maintain that any reading that regards the mythological case as now closed risks eliding an important dimension of its meaning. The poem still proffers a fertility myth, but one in which fer tility is less a collective value from the standpoint of cultural anthropol ogy, than an issue in human physiology as understood in contemporary natural philosophy and medical theory. I suggest that the sovereignty that Ragnell asks from Gawen, and which he freely grants her, is actually to be understood in a sexual sense. Approaching Weddynge from this per spective explains the cultural work the myth performs for its contempo rary audience and defines more exactly what Dame Ragnell means when she says "Of the moste manlyest is oure desyre, / To haue the souereynte of suche a syre" (428-29). One essay does focus on the poem's mythic background in provoca tive fashion. In "The Riddle of Sovereignty," Manuel Aguirre retraces the Sovereignty-of-Ireland theme and agrees with Loomis that despite the continuity the English Loathly Lady stories display with the Irish ana logues, the changes they make subvert the meaning of the original myth. While Aguirre finds the "territorial theme" is still residually present in Weddynge, "the figure of the woman is being taken out of the field of land symbolism and relegated to the (more literal) domestic sphere: Sovereignty over land is being displaced in favour of Sovereignty in love."8 This seems precisely right. But I part company with Aguirre in the infer ence he draws about this reinterpretation. He argues that the English writers would have been ignorant of the numinous value the Loathly Lady carried in the Irish tales: they would not have recognized her either as the flaitheas na h-Eirenn (the Sovereignty of Ireland), or as the Mother of all life, the earth-goddess. For that reason, according to Aguirre, they could not fathom why a figure like Ragnell should demand sovereignty in love from the hero, for there was no way she could have been entitled to it. In Aguirre's view, therefore, her claim would have seemed, to poet and audience alike, "downright preposterous" and "unreasonable."9 I disagree. Aguirre assumes the temper of the times in the fifteenth century to have been utterly opposed to the idea that women should</page><page sequence="3">200 THE CHAUCER REVIEW exercise sovereignty in love. I suggest that female sovereignty, understood in a sexual sense, was in fact regarded as a necessary condition for con ception, and that wide acceptance of this principle would have made Ragnell's claim far from transgressive. Let us turn, therefore, to examine the traditional mythic features of Weddynge that still retain latent signifi cance as constituent elements in a more up-to-date fifteenth-century fer tility myth. Briefly put, the poem gives us two formerly hieratic characters, the sun god, lord of nature and fertility (Sir Gromer Somerjoure), and his sis ter-consort, the earth-goddess (Dame Ragnell), together with a pretender to (or usurper of) the sun-god's position (Gawen). (Arthur is also pres ent, of course, but he is rather peripheral to the mythic plot, the way the Fisher King is peripheral to the plot of the Grail myth.) Gawen's achieve ment of the notional status of sun-god and his fruitful union with the earth-goddess will depend on his own correct understanding of the answer to the riddling question concerning the object of female desire. Under Ragnell's tutelage he comes to know the true relationship between fertility and female sovereignty. We begin with Arthur's antagonist, Sir Gromer Somerjoure, and his peculiar name.10 Names are often among the most conservative elements in the transmission of medieval story, and we have one here that likely adumbrates this character's role in the fertility myth from which the Loathly Lady story derives. Transliterated as "man of a summer's day" (or "^summer's day," the summer solstice), or reduced simply to "man of summertime" or "summer-man," the name points to Somerjoure's ori gin as the sun-god, the embodiment of nature's procreative power. We learn at line 475 that Somerjoure is brother to Ragnell; in the originat ing myth he was doubtless her consort, the sun married to the earth in fructifying union.11 While his name might argue a certain benignity, Somerjoure is a strong and formidable presence?"Armyd welle and sure; / A knyghte f?lle strong and of greatt myghte" (51-52)?and he easily intimidates and overmatches Arthur; his behavior implies the sta tus of a god in disguise. (We see something similar in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight when the Green Knight?another avatar of a vegetation god?confronts Arthur in Camelot.)12 Somerjoure is a denizen of the forest, a dangerous, uncivilized, liminal space where humans would be most likely to encounter the numinous. Arthur is viewed as an intruder here, and perhaps his killing of the deer hints at an offense against this lord of nature. But the deer is not what Somerjoure is angry about. Rather, the bone he has to pick with Arthur has to do specifically with Gawen. He com plains to Arthur, "Thou hast gevyn my landes in certayn, / Withe greatt wrong vnto Sir Gawen" (58-59). Gawen is the usurper of the sun-god's</page><page sequence="4">JOHN BUGGE 201 rightful territorial holdings, a threat to the elemental union between sun and land sanctified in myth. When Arthur asks his name, Somer Joure tells it, adding that he does so "withe ryghte" (63), a phrase that may be more than a formulaic tag, implying Somer Joure feels his name prop erly belongs to him alone; he seems angry over a case of stolen identity. He has ample reason for concern, of course, as Gawain has long been acknowledged in myth as an avatar of the sun-god. To Loomis, for exam ple, the equivalence of Gawain with the Irish solar hero Cuchulinn is a "commonplace" of scholarship.13 Such a mythological understanding of his krasis, while now entirely out of fashion, needs to be borne in mind. Specifically, we must consider Gawen's assumption of the sun-god's role to be presumptive and premature at this point. While a paragon of chivalry?he is "gentylle Gawen knyghte" (142) and "Gawen the good" (192), and "Of alle knyghtes . . . the flowre" (373)?Gawen does not yet deserve the status of sun-god. He is not yet a proper consort to the earth goddess because he has not yet been initiated into the knowledge the poem's resident nature-god Somer Joure is privy to, and which is con tained in the latter's riddling question posed to Arthur about "whate wemen love best" (91). In the logic of this new fertility myth, the correct answer to the riddle insures fecundity; the wrong answer results in death (degree zero in the calculus of fertility). We need to see how. Somer Joure quite properly "owns" the riddle and understands why sovereignty is so important to women (and to the race). But he is not the only one who knows; Ragnell does too, as of course she would in her mythic role as the earth-goddess and sister-consort of the sun-god. Their kinship and shared knowledge of the correct answer to the rid dle suggest we look closer at Ragnell and the implications she brings for the theme of fertility through sovereignty. As a descendant of the earth goddess, she changes to beauteous young maiden as her proto type does in Irish legend, which, as Loomis writes, "provides several stories of the transformation of a hideous hag which can be recognized as charming allegories of the sere fields and forests bursting into beauty at the kiss and warm embrace of the young sun"?of winter turning into spring.14 In a comparative strain, Loomis goes on to asso ciate Ragnell even with the goddesses referred to by Strabo who were worshiped at Samothrace, especially Hecate, one of whose "peculiari ties" was "her power of taking on hideous forms." But she could also shift her shape in the opposite direction, taking on the form of Demeter, "the fair goddess of fruits."15 While Ragnell's metamorpho sis once must have had seasonal implications, the description of her as a hag adds another, quite different dimension to her meaning. When we first encounter her, in lines 227 and following, she displays a gross and fearsome eroticism.</page><page sequence="5">202 THE CHAUCER REVIEW First, she is hyperbolically large. Everything about her is outsized: her "mowithe wyde"; her "bleryd eyen gretter then a balle"; her fantastically long teeth (like tusks) that hang "ouere her lyppes"; her cheeks as wide "as wemens hyppes"; her "nek long and therto greatt"; her "sholders . . . a yard brode"; and her "Hangyng pappys to be an hors lode"?each large enough to service a platoon (232-41). Further, she is shaped "lyke a barelle" (242), of a size fit for the easy bearing of children. This Rabelaisian catalogue seems almost a cruel parody of a Neolithic Venus of Willendorf, a reductio ad absurdum of the earth Mother, a figure mas sively parturitive. Yet, paradoxically, because of her sheer size and ugli ness, she would be a formidable and even terrifying sexual partner, not only not sexually attractive but positively repellent. In her present form, that is, she represents the coarse and animalistic side of female fertility. Note, however, that her repulsiveness does not consort either with the "lute she bare vpon her bak" (237), or with the gay finery with which her horse is outfitted (246-51 ).16 The lute connotes harmony, courtly refine ment, the pleasures of young love, while the "gold" and "many a precious stone" that bedeck her palfrey also provide a hint of the other, pre bewitchment Ragnell. (Compare a similar opposition between "the raw and the cooked" in the figure of the Green Knight in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.17) Perhaps more important than her size, her childbearing capacity, and her ugliness, are the associations with gross animality, especially with pig gishness, that suggest an overheated sexuality. She has teeth like the tusks of a wild boar (235, 548-51), she is compared to a sow (597), and she eats like a pig?as much as six people (605; cf. 610-19). She is a woman of gross and bestial appetite, not just gustatory but also (by implication) sexual, since there is ample evidence linking the boar or pig in the popu lar imagination with unbridled appetite, especially sexual appetite.18 More importantly, plentiful evidence connects boars and sows to the ancient cult of the earth-goddess, traces of which survived in Europe at least until the seventeenth century.19 Ragnell also compares herself to an owl, first when she says to Arthur that even owls, noted for their ugliness, get to choose a mate (310), and when she adds a few lines later that even though men may refer to her as an owl, she is nevertheless a lady (316-17). The popular estimate of owls is also interesting. The medieval bestiary reports that in Leviticus the owl is counted among "the unclean creatures": if others catch the owl in flagrante delicto they will treat him roughly, "because the righteous hate the carnal deeds of the sinner."20 Other parts of our text support the notion that Ragnell is indeed sexually avid. Arthur assures her, for exam ple, that Gawen will marry her if she reveals what women most desire, adding that "your desyre nowe shalle ye haue, / Bo the in bowre and in</page><page sequence="6">JOHN BUGGE 203 bed" (400-1 ). The pleonastic "bedroom and bed" argues that Arthur real izes the sexual hunger that drives the hag to make this bargain. Later, after Ragnell's transformation, Gawen assures the court that "My loue shalle she haue, / Thereafter nede she neuere more craue " (790-91). She had indeed cravedhis love, but now Gawen declares himself ready to satisfy her needs. All in all, it is hard to miss Ragnell's overwhelming erotic drive. Her similarity to an owl evokes another set of meanings as well. In the bestiary the owl (the screech owl, to be precise) is also associated with death, given its habit of "hovering around graves by day and night"; Ovid is invoked as well, for in the Metamorphoses (V 550) the owl is "a loath some bird, which heralds impending disaster, a harbinger of woe for mor tals."21 For Chaucer she is "proph?te . . . of wo and of myschaunce" (LGW 2254), the bird "that of deth the bode bryngeth" (PF 343) ,22 True to her animal typing, Ragnell seems alarming and threatening in the extreme. She is "fowlle and horyble" (547), has fingernails (talons?) three inches long (607), and inspires curses: "Alle men then that euere her sawe, / Bad the deville her bonys gnawe" (616-17). The morning after the mar riage ceremony, before he knows of her transformation, Arthur expresses a fear that "the fende" (i.e., Ragnell) might have slain Gawen in the mar riage bed (724-26). These and other details indicate that the hag presages disaster and death. If that were not enough, Ragnell is consistently associated with old age as well. Although she is not in fact advanced in years, her physical char acteristics paint a picture of an aged, decrepit crone: her nose runs, her teeth are yellowed, her eyes are bleary, and she is long in the tooth (231-33, 235); moreover, she has "grey herys" around her mouth (553)? the beginnings of a beard. She poignantly admits to Arthur that women want "To be holden nott old, butt fresshe and yong" (415), but gets no such treatment from her brother, who calls her an "old scott [horse]" (476). Ragnell definitely looks over the hill, her best days behind her. Now, a potential bridegroom's "problem" with elde is presumably that it makes a woman less physically desirable, a deterrent to male desire. Such, indeed, is the usual interpretation of the Loathly Lady?she is loathsome from the perspective of a male suitor. But in the deep-lying and anterior mythic register, the more fundamental reason why her age is a problem is that it makes her infertile. The descriptio of Ragnell signals a close asso ciation with postmenopausal infertility, which is to say with non-life?or with death. And not only is she a baleful, wintry figure to her brother's "summer's day," she does seem to threaten both Gawen and the king with mortality. We have already noted how Arthur wonders aloud whether Gawen has survived the first night of his honeymoon: "lett vs go and asaye, / Yf Sir Gawen be on lyve" (722-23). Earlier Gawen himself had</page><page sequence="7">204 THE CHAUCER REVIEW put the idea into Arthur's head that Ragnell was fiendish: he protests he would wed her many times over for Arthur's sake, "Thowghe she were a fend, / Thowghe she were as foulle as Belsabub" (344-45). The appar ent prospect of death she portends matches her mythic role as fertility goddess manquee. As the loathly hag, she is the very opposite of young and fertile and desirable, an uncanny death figure, Hecate-like, allied with demonology. In the logic of this poem's new fertility myth, though, the ugly Ragnell's status as a death figure is exactly proportionate to the punishment to be imposed on the king should he fail to answer Somerjoure's riddling question. For the first 472 lines of the poem, Arthur's life hangs in the balance so long as he remains ignorant of "whate wemen love best" (91). The theme of the king's possible death (in its various iterations?saving his life, being killed, losing his life, etc.) comes up incessantly, 39 times in as many lines. The concept of the dead king is, of course, rife with implications for the meaning of this poem as a disguised fertility myth, for if the king is married to the land, when the king dies, the land dies too, or grows sterile and infertile.23 Moreover, it is crucial to notice the kind of death Arthur would suffer: he would be decapitated. Somerjoure tells Arthur, "Thyne hed thou shalt lose for thy travaylle" (98). His sister consort Ragnell agrees. Arrange my marriage to Gawen, she says, "Or elles thou shalt lose thy hed" (269; she says it again in 289). Under these circumstances, it would be remiss to ignore Freud's fundamental insight that in dream symbolism, and presumably therefore also in myth, decapi tation symbolizes castration.24 Thus, following the logic of myth, if Arthur fails to learn that women want sovereignty, he will be symbolically cas trated, made impotent and "f?lle tame" (477); he will lose his own virile potency, and in mythic terms cause a loss of fertility to the land as well. Not to know what women want is to be rendered infertile, powerless, impotent, castrate. In this, of course, as suggested above, we hear distinct echoes of the Grail myth. Arthur's threatened condition (as symbolized by decapita tion) closely resembles the sexual wound that incapacitates the Fisher King.25 Both the Grail myth and the fertility myth which lies beneath Weddynge involve healing or saving the king, and thus the land, through a speech act: in the Grail myth the maimed king can be healed if the right question is asked of him; here the king is symbolically threatened with sexual mutilation if he fails to respond correctiy to a question whose answer is intimately connected to female fertility. But Arthur is not the only character who faces Somerjoure's riddling question of what women most desire. Gawen, too, encounters it implic itly when he faces Ragnell's riddling question,</page><page sequence="8">JOHN BUGGE 205 Wheder ye wolle haue me fayre on nyghtes, And as foulle on days to alle men sigh tes, Or els to have me fayre on days, And on nyghtes on the fowlyst wife. (659-62) Actually, the question is both a parody of, and thus a challenge to, unreconstructed male desire. From Gawen's still unregenerate point of view, the simple binary choice is between fair and foul. "Fair" is short hand for desirable sex object, passive recipient of male lust, conventional object of the appropriative male gaze, and cause of his "worship" in other men's eyes. "Foul," on the other hand, means sexual aggressor, subject of an animal-like libidinous drive, threat to the male ego, and consort whose appearance is ruinous to a man's reputation. But the choice is not that simple: Ragnell says "fair by day, foul by night, or vice versa," a dou ble dichotomy. Fair by day, Ragnell would be the perfect trophy wife, while fair by night she would serve as an ever-tantalizing morsel. But as Gawen himself puts it, were she fair only at night?and monstrous while the sun shines?it would "gr?ve my hartt ryghte sore, / And my worshypp shold I lese" (671-72). By the same token, were she fair only during the day and repulsive at night, "Then on nyghtes I shold haue a symple repayre" (674). Either choice involves an unacceptable negative outcome. And, although it has never been noted in the criticism on Weddynge, either choice would also be only about Gawen, reflecting only the stark polarities of the male ego's construction of desire. But how do the masculinist terms of Gawen's quandary relate to fer tility? In simple terms, they constitute an impediment to it. So long as "foul" symbolizes "dangerous and aggressive female lust," while "fair" stands for "appealingly submissive object and receptacle of male desire," and so long as Gawen continues to see these as incompatible and even dichotomous, there is no hope of a resolution to his predicament. Rather, Gawen must transcend such either/or thinking and learn to see "fair or foul" as a false dichotomy. He must envision "fair and foul": he must accept the "foul," the blatant, unruly fact of female desire, as coequal to the "fair" and acquiesce in the eternal ambivalence of the two in one. He manages to do this, of course, when he surrenders his right, but also sheds his obligation, to choose one of the options Ragnell had proposed: "Lose me when ye lyst, for I am bond; / I putt the choyse in you" (680-81). His answer reveals a kind of existential appreciation of what Ragnell most wants, for as soon as the words are out of his mouth, Ragnell responds with thanks and a blessing upon Gawen, declaring "now am I worshyppyd" (687), for "thou . . . / Has gevyn me the soueryente</page><page sequence="9">206 THE CHAUCER REVIEW serteyn" (700-1). Note that "worship" (literally "worth-ship," a sense of worth) and "sovereignty" are causally linked in Ragnell's mind. Gawen's conceding the choice to her in love-matters gives her worth, standing, and validity as a desiring subject. Ragnell is initially transformed when Gawen decides to let her desire rule in the matter of the payment of the marriage debt?"I wolle do more / Then for to kysse," he blurts out (638-39), and turns to her?but in the last analysis it is his free, calm, and judicious yielding of sovereignty that causes Ragnell's permanent transformation from a death-figure to a goddess of springtime fertility: "Thou shalle haue me fayre bothe day and nyghte, / And euere whyle I lyve as fayre and bryghte" (688-89). Her transformation results not from necromancy or magic (no fairy godmother figure or dea ex machina enters to effect the change), but from an action by her male partner. The modern fertility narrative implicit here thus seems to stipulate that a positive outcome depends on the male's own ability to transform himself, to overcome his instinc tive anxiety about the dark threat of female desire and to achieve a new level of consciousness in which he can acknowledge both its validity and its necessity. And so we come to the true meaning of sovereignty in love: it means sovereignty in eros, sexual sovereignty, as a close reading of the poem's central passage verifies. In the prelude to her disclosure to Arthur of what women most desire, Ragnell notes that "Summe men sayn" women want to be good-looking, and to have diverse new partners, pleasure in bed, and to be wedded often (408-12); but men who believe these things do not understand (413). She adds that women "desyre a-noder maner thing," a different category of satisfaction entirely, "To be holden nott old, butt fresshe and yong" (414-15). In other words, women desire to be regarded as young and in the bloom of life, the term fresshe signifying youthful, energetic, active (and not faded, worn, or exhausted). Here, unfortunately, a line seems missing in the text, line *415a, one that should have ended with a rhyme on crave in line 418. Lacking that short third line of this tail-rhyme grouping of six (414 ff.), we cannot know what interpretation Ragnell was placing on the idea that women want to be regarded as "fresshe and yong," but the sentiment certainly points to her longed-for transformation into a fertility figure. The next set of three lines seems intact, however, and there Ragnell admits that men can get what they want from women with various strategies of sexual playfulness: "Withe flatryng and glosyng and quaynt gyn / So ye men may vs wemen euere wyn, / Of whate ye wolle crave" (416-18). The next line says, how ever, that these blandishments do not come close to a true statement of what women want: Ye goo f?lle nyse, I wolle nott lye" (419). Still, the saucy pun on quaynt is not just an incidental indecency for the sake of a laugh;</page><page sequence="10">JOHN BUGGE 207 it also serves as a keynote to the sense of the following lines in which Ragnell finally provides the most authentic answer to Somer Joure's rid dling question: Butt there is one thyng is alle oure fantasye, And that nowe shalle ye knowe: We desyren of men aboue alle maner thyng, To haue the souereynte, withoute lesyng, Of alle, bothe hyghe and lowe. For where we haue souereynte alle is ourys, Thoughe a knyghte be neuere so ferys, And euere the mas try wynne; Of the moste manlyest is oure desyre, To haue the souereynte of suche a syre, Suche is oure crafte and gynne. (420-30) There is no mention of goods, money, or property here. Ragnell shows none of the entrepreneurial interest in acquiring control over a hus band's wealth that we might tend to read into the concept of sovereignty in the Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale. The sovereignty Ragnell here describes, and which later she receives from Gawen, is not to be under stood in material or economic terms. But even granting that much, does not line 425?"For where we haue souereynte alle is ourys"?say that women are simply power-mad, intent on control of men even of the high est rank? Does Ragnell not sin here against medieval notions of proper hierarchy in marriage? This is how the concept of sovereignty has often been read, as a zero-sum game in the battle of the sexes, a threat to patri archal control. But so to read is to assume that women want to be men or to supplant them in power and prerogatives. We shall not make that mistake if we keep the focus on sovereignty in love. The fertility theme in this poem poses the elemental question: whose will, male or female's, must dominate in the marital relationship if the propagation of the species is to be maintained? The answer is, the female's. Women want sovereignty of men who are ferys, "fierce," and who try to win mastry over them (426-27). It is just such men?"the moste manlyest" (428; cp. 470), the most male, the most sexually assertive? whom women want sovereignty from. Such puissant men are the most capable of siringa child: to gain "souereynte o/suche a syre," that is, to gain sexual control from such a man (and not necessarily, or even appar ently, over him?we have probably been misreading this preposition all along), Ragnell says, "Suche is oure crafte and gynne" (429-30; italics added). Far from devious or malevolent, this last utterance simply admits</page><page sequence="11">208 THE CHAUCER REVIEW that women do want their will to be sovereign in that most intimate physi cal relationship in which the male is doing his utmost to satisfy his own sexual urges: in the view of the poem's author, women want the female orgasm to rival the male's, even to predominate and be the focus of the male's concern. This, Ragnell admits, is every woman's "fantasye" (420), and a good case can be made that this is also the message of both Gower's Tale ofFlorent26 and Chaucer's Wife of Bath's Tale.27 The proposition that a woman's sexual pleasure should occupy the pre eminent position in coitus is the true answer to the riddling question of what women most desire, for it is only when the female comes to orgasm that pregnancy can result. This simple cause-and-effect relationship derives from a physiological model that enjoyed widespread currency in fifteenth-century medical theory, the so-called "two-seed" theory of conception.28 Throughout the Middle Ages there were two opposed views on animal conception, depending on whether one credited the existence of "female sperm."29 According to the "one-seed" theory, propounded by Aristotle and his medieval scholastic commentators, only the male produces real seed or sperma from his blood, and only the male seed is required for con ception. The woman's "seed" is not properly seed at all, but a substance formed from menstrual blood. Moreover, the woman's role is entirely passive. She is merely a receptacle for the man's seed, and she need not participate actively for conception to occur. She exercises no control or sovereignty in the sex act.30 In this view, the female is only matter to the male's form; her contribution therefore cannot itself be formative. While Aristotle's medieval commentators do not overtly deny the existence of female sperm, they downplay its importance in conception. Typical is Giles of Rome in his De formatione corporis humani in utero, who says (in what became a popular analogy) that male sperm behaves like rennet in milk. In his defense of the Aristotelian position, Giles "supplied argu ments capable of clearing the male of all responsibility in the woman's quest for pleasure," while suggesting that the female could "become preg nant without experiencing orgasm, without any pleasure?practically without knowing it."31 The older and far more widely accepted "two-seed" theory takes a very different view. A number of pre-Socratic philosophers believed that the female plays an active role in conception, but it was Hippocrates who is credited with first asserting that both spouses contributed seminal fluids and that without doubt the embryo comes from the union of two seeds.32 The theory was more fully elaborated in the second century C.E. by Galen, who stipulated that for conception to occur it was necessary that the woman be "active" and also produce her own "seed." In practical terms, this meant that the woman must experience what the male expe</page><page sequence="12">JOHN BUGGE 209 riences in the emission of his seed?that is, orgasm.33 As Angus McLaren writes, Galen's "compilation of medical theories was to dominate west ern thought for the next fifteen hundred years."34 His views were adopted in the twelfth century, for example, by Avicenna, who cites Galen in his discussion of how the membrane that will surround the fetus is formed "like a protective coating left behind by the sperm of the female when it flows towards the place where the male's sperm also flows" and "mixes with it during intercourse."35 Although they knew of the conflict between the Aristotelian and Galenic views on conception, most Western scholars accepted the notion of female sperm they had taken from Arab medical writers.36 One such figure, for example, was William of Saliceto, a late-thirteenth-century pro fessor of medicine at Bologna, whose Summa conservationis et curationis (1285) deals with the organs of the body, especially the genitals, and fea tures a disquisition "On those things which aid conception," in the course of which there is an elaborate discussion of female orgasm and the means of achieving it. One of William's major sources was Avicenna's Canon of Medicine, which discusses various means of increasing the female's plea sure in coition, for if "the woman fails to enjoy herself and emit her seed, . . . she will not bear a son."37 The two-seed theory of conception and the ideas that surrounded it also found their way into popular literature. For example, in France, the Secreta mulierum, from the last quarter of the thir teenth century and probably composed by a student of Albertus Magnus, was known there more widely in translation as Secr?s des dames. Even while taking a strong masculinist view of sexual relations, the treatise admits that "it is the man who is responsible for ensuring that the woman expe riences full satisfaction in heterosexual intercourse, since conception cannot take place without it."38 In England, too, in John Trevisa's trans lation of Bartholomaeus Anglicus's encyclopedia, the Galenic thesis still has the status of common knowledge: The mater of the childe is mater seminalis, that is ischad by worch ing of generacioun, and cometh of alle the parties of the fadir and modir. First this mater is isched in the place of conceyvynge abrood, that is by the drawinge of vertue of kynde igadred toge dres in celles of the modir, and is medled togedre by worchinge of kinde hete. For but digest blood of the fadir and of the modir were imedled togedre there mygte be no creacioun nothir schapinge of childe.39 A fourteenth-century Middle English treatise on "The Nature of Women" describes the "stones" or female testicles (ovaries) "be J)e wheche spermat is mynystered by. Pe stonys sothly of wommen ben put on both partees of ?&gt;e matryce and J)o be mor round and smaller J)an</page><page sequence="13">210 THE CHAUCER REVIEW menys stones ben." As Monica Green notes, these "were understood to function in every respect in the same way as men's, that is, to produce a seminal fluid ejaculated into the womb during orgasm."40 Furthermore, as James Brundage writes, Female orgasm seemed critical not only to medical writers but also to theologians who relied on their expertise in such matters, since they believed that only when a woman "emitted her seed" could conception occur. Failure of either partner to achieve orgasm ren dered intercourse nonprocreative and thus presented a moral problem, particularly if the woman deliberately refrained from yielding to sexual pleasure.41 In summary, our close reading of Weddynge for its emphasis on female sexual desire, combined with an appreciation of medieval medical the ory on how conception occurs, makes it highly likely that female sover eignty should be defined quite narrowly as sovereignty in love, and that furthermore love means 'sexual love, eros, coition.' What are the impli cations of this conclusion for a better understanding of this poem and its place in the ideas of fifteenth-century England? First, alone among the four English versions of the Loathly Damsel story, Weddynge ends with a birth, the fruit of coition. If we take Ragnell's transformation to fair-and-beautiful as equivalent to a change from post menopause to youthful fecundity, her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Gawen's son Gyngolyn (799) makes perfect sense. Her shapeshifting, in other words, has a higher purpose than simply rewarding Gawen with superior sex for laudable faithfulness to his marriage vows. Moreover, with out such a transformation of the bride, which Gawen's ceding of sover eignty brings about, his marriage to Ragnell would have remained sterile and infertile, an inverted fabliau plot, a reverse May-December union equally as malapropos as Januarie's marriage to May in Chaucer's Merchant's Tale, where, as we know, the faulty puissance of the bridegroom and the rank overheated fertility of the bride figure importantiy through out. The fabliau tradition implicitly acknowledges the natural impropri ety of such unions; it is no surprise that a romance based on a fertility myth should be equally concerned to establish the appositeness of a mar riage between two lovers in the bloom of youth.42 Second, female sexual sovereignty is shown to make marriage blissful for both partners. Once Gawen has made the proper choice, Ragnell assures him that "Of alle erthly knyghtes blyssyd mott thou be," for "Thou shalle haue me fayre bothe day and nyghte, / And euere whyle I lyve as fayre and bryghte" (686, 688-89). Not only does a man have nothing to fear by giving a woman sexual control (701-2); doing so in fact insures his "joye oute of mynde" (706), as "Withe joye and myrthe," in fact,</page><page sequence="14">JOHN BUGGE 211 Gawen and Ragnell "wakyd tylle daye" (715). In this, the poet declares, the couple acts according to "reason and cours of kynde" (707). For the male to grant sexual sovereignty to the female and thereby gain untold pleasure for himself is thus to adhere to nature's rational plan for humankind. Third, the male's grant of sexual sovereignty is an acknowledgment of female worth. Immediately after Gawen tells Ragnell to choose for him, she declares "now am I worshyppyd" (687); she has been granted "worth ship" in his eyes because of his having acknowledged the validity and even the preeminence of her desire. From having been rather narcissistically concerned about losing his own reputation if Ragnell were to be "fayre on nyghtes and no more" (670), Gawen makes a breakthrough when he grants Ragnell the status, at the least, of a coequal desiring subject. Of course, we need to remember why men might have been inclined so to honor female desire: given the widespread acceptance of Galen's view of the process of conception, a husband could not hope for an heir, the continuation of the patriarchal line, were he not to accede to his wife's sexual wants in the bedroom. Finally, and paradoxically, granting sexual sovereignty to the female insures marital harmony and mutual respect. Ragnell promises Gawen she will be "obaysaunt" to him "And neuere withe [him] to debate" (784, 786). This is not a pledge of subservience, but an assurance that the two will live in concord. Given sexual sovereignty, Ragnell at once returns the favor by giving her husband the spousal sovereignty due him according to the orthodox Pauline pronouncement that the husband shall be head of the wife. Still, it is clear enough from the text that the happy couple will have achieved something like parity between the sheets, which is pre cisely what canon law from the twelfth century onward stipulated: men and women have equal sexual rights in marriage, based in part on Paul, I Corinthinans 7.3, the marriage debt passage. As Brundage writes, "The marital debt, then, legitimized sexual rights within marriage and at the same time secured for married women a sharply limited area of equality with their husbands."43 In addition, "the principle of equal sexual rights within marriage" was "a fundamental tenet of matrimonial law"; its impor tance lay in that it "implicitly conceded not only that it was natural for women to have sexual desires, just as men did, but also that their right to satisfy these desires within marriage was just as important as the satis faction of men's sexual urges."44 Once Ragnell has produced an heir, the essential mythic plot of Weddynge is complete and comes to an end at line 804, while the text con tinues on in fits and starts for fifty-one more lines, adding adventitious themes, tiresome recapitulations, and attempts to tie up loose ends. For example, we get the absurdly inconsistent theme of the hero unmanned by love ("As a coward he lay by her bo the day and nyghte, / Neuere wold</page><page sequence="15">212 THE CHAUCER REVIEW he haunt justyng aryghte" [808-9]), an oddly perfunctory undertow of patriarchal reaction against giving women sovereignty. We hear of Ragnell's request that Arthur pardon her brother Somerjoure; we learn of her early death and of Gawen's undying grief despite his many subse quent marriages; and we witness the poet's final plea for deliverance from prison, "be-sett withe gaylours many" (844). But all this supererogatory matter should not distract us from the importance of the modern fertil ity myth lodged within this rendition of the Loathly Lady story, for it con tains an idea of great consequence for our understanding of late medieval English culture. As our final task, therefore, we should try to take stock of the cultural work the myth in this new guise seems intended to perform. Reduced to its essence, the poem is about the validity of female sexual desire.45 Its plot puts two representative men, Arthur and Gawen, to the test of whether they are able to acknowledge, understand, valorize, and finally?in Gawen's case?satisfy female desire within the confines of mar riage. The poem is directed to a male audience, for it is men who must pass beyond the confines of their own limited experience and learn what the other half of the race presumably wants. Weddynge certainly exhibits collective male anxiety about a hero's acquiescing to female desire, but it also "proves" through its storybook happy ending that such anxiety is not only groundless but, more important, even detrimental to the con tinuance of the race. In an older and more narrowly patriarchal context, to acknowledge female desire might have risked the charge of effemi nacy, but in the fifteenth century to risk not knowing what women want is, in starkest terms, to go childless to the grave. It is a commonplace that medieval romance involves the construction of male identity by means of the individuation the hero achieves through involvement in an erotic relationship?love as a path to inner discovery. Colin Morris sees this introspective process beginning in the troubadour lyric and continuing through the whole of the twelfth century's "persis tent attraction for the legend of Narcissus and the symbol of the mirror, which were used to describe 'the birth of self-consciousness through love.'"46 In the thirteenth century, as well, a similar emphasis on "becom ing male" continues in both parts of the Roman de la Rose, where the female love object first serves only as a mirror to the hero's own narcis sistic preoccupation with the self and its desires, and then, in Jean de Meun's continuation, merely as a means to what Alastair Minnis has called the hero's "masculation." Minnis writes that the obscene ending of the poem focuses exclusively on "the performance of masculinity" by Amant, while the female figure remains "shadowy and unrealized": "The rite de passage is not hers but her male lover's, and vicariously that of the text's male readers." As masculinity is seen to realize itself in coitus, "it is male strength which is the chosen subject of this ending."47</page><page sequence="16">JOHN BUGGE 213 A rather different attitude toward becoming male appears in the romances of Chr?tien de Troyes, each a "fiction of individuation" wherein the knight-errant heroes have what Donald Maddox has called "specular encounters," often through the agency of a female character, which "always occur at a major intersection of selfhood with a crucial new per spective on its own identity" and "are thus instrumental in modifying the protagonist's self-perception."48 What occurs in Weddynge is similar to the specular encounter Maddox describes, as the hero Gawen undergoes a kind of awakening to the insuf ficiency of his own view of the role of sexuality in married love. The result represents a much-advanced stage of maturation in the quest for male identity. It is important finally to note that heroes of earlier romance?the heroes of the Round Table, for example?are for the most part not mar ried men; their concerns (even those of Chretien's Erec, an exception) are those of young adolescents. The trend toward a more mature self appraisal on the part of the romance hero might be seen as reaching a high point in Weddynge, which is still concerned with male identity, but no longer in the same self-referential way. In the English tradition it is important to acknowledge the huge difference between the Gawain of the fourteenth-century Sir Gawain and the Green Knight?young, head strong, impetuous, and a trifle conceited?and this later Gawen, who, as the title of the poem reminds us, becomes a happily married man. Knight-bachelors and husbands have different priorities. While an ear lier Gawain might have been devoted to using eros as a reflector in which to view his own considerable worth, the mature Gawen of Weddynge, more confident now of his own identity and concerned to reproduce that iden tity in a son and heir, would make it his business to pose an answer to Freud's famous question, and specifically the answer implied in his wise decision to offer Ragnell sovereignty in love.

In Gower, as Lindahl notes, the Loathly Lady's pronouncement "differs signifi cantly" in being limited to "not simply sovereignty, but specifically sovereignty in love" ("Oral Undertones," 72). In warning Amant against Pride in love, Genius says that "ofte sithe in such a wise / Obedience in love availeth, / Wher al a mannes strengthe faileth" (I 1400-1402; italics added; quoted from John Gower, Confessio Amantis, ed. Russell A. Peck, 2 vols. [Kalamazoo, Mich., 2000], 1:138-51); acceding to female desire often works when simple aggressive virility will not. Florent's name (after floreo, 'to bloom, blossom, flower') recalls the sun-god of fertility myth, while the grandmother who first poses the riddling question is called "that olde Mone" (I 1634), a term Peck glosses as 'consort,' supplying OE gemana 'intercourse' as the etymon. But "consort" seems overpolite for 'sexual com panion' or even 'whore,' the inference being that the old woman who tests the hero on what women most desire is herself an adept in the mysteries of coition. As to the Loathly Damsel herself, she is, like Ragnell in Weddynge, sexually repulsive: "Hire necke is schort, hir schuldres courbe? / That myhte a mannes lust destourbe" (I 1687-88; italics added). Gower seems to want to secure an ironic point about the deflation of male desire while suggesting the hag herself is sexually voracious. She is described (I 1734) as "this foule grete coise" ('rump' following Peck, from OF cuisse, literally 'thigh,' but probably, as in modern French, a euphemism for pudendum, as in, along with similar phrases, aller aux cuisses, 'to have coition' [Joseph Marks, Harrap's French-English Dictionary of Slang and Colloquialisms (London, 1970), 75]). The hag also takes the initiative on the wedding night, beginning to "pleie and rage" (I 1764) as she admits to Florent that her motives have been sexual: "For I to that entente wedde, / That thou schalt be my worldes blisse" (11770-71). Pressing the attack, she kisses Florent "As sehe a lusti lady were" (I 1773), and once they are naked abed she embraces him, much against his will, as, like May in MerT, Florent lies "stille as eny ston" (I 1794), unable to muster even the faintest stirrings of libido. When he still refuses to turn toward her, she reminds him of his wedding pledge, and this invoca tion of his obligation to "pay the marriage debt" finally wins his assent (I 1795-99). Transformed to a lady "Of eyhtetiene wynter age" (I 1803), she poses the riddling question</page><page sequence="19">216 THE CHAUCER REVIEW of fair-by-day or fair-by-night. Florent makes a pledge of obedience to her will (11828-31), not his own, and she thanks him for giving her sovereignty in love (I 1834), which is the key to love and also to male pleasure: "obedience / Mai wel fortune a man to love / And sette him in his lust above..." (I 1858-60; italics added). Genius, whose own name signals the cosmic purpose of ?ras, closes the tale with the injunction to Amant, "if thou do ryht, / Thou schalt unto thi love obeie, / And folwe hir will be alle weie" (I 1862-64). The sex ual understanding of sovereignty in love in Gower's tale could hardly be clearer. 27. Alice begins with a sly reference to the aggressive lust of modern friars, who are nevertheless no match for the incubus-like elves of "th'olde dayes of the Kyng Arthour" (III 857) whom they have supplanted; the friars' notable inability to cause pregnancy hints that Chaucer may have been aware of the general association of Loathly Lady stories with fertility and reproduction. Rapes by friars yield to the rape of the "mayde" by a "lusty bacheler" (III 886, 883) of Arthur's court; all such aggressive sexual behavior is meant to stand as the limit case of male sexual domination, oblivious of female desire and for that reason punishable by beheading (symbolic castration again) if the knight fails to learn "What thyng is it that wommen moost desiren" (III 905). The answer, supplied by the shapeshifting hag, avatar of the pre-Christian earth-goddess, is "Wommen desiren to have sovereynetee / As wel over hir housbond as hir love, / And for to been in maistrie hym above" (III 1038-40, italics added). Note that sovereignty is not limited to marriage but includes adultery, and thus seems a more inclusive concept pertaining to the female's sexual rela tions generally. Women desire to have sovereignty and to be in mastery: are these the same thing? Perhaps not. In WBPro Alice had asserted that she got "the soveraynetee" from her fifth husband "By maistrie" (III 818, italics added), that is, by using mastery as a means to that end. The word's fourth meaning, according to the MED, suggests Alice won out through her: 'Special skill or . . . method or technique'; 'work in which one is skilled'; 'a feat of physical skill or strength'; or 'cunning, deceit.' Nothing, in other words, prevents our attaching a sexual sense to maistrie as well, especially when it is the means Alice uses to gain sovereignty over her husband's "tonge, and of his hond also" (III 815). Alice's part ing shot, the coda of her tale, prays for "Housboundes meeke, yonge, and fressh abedde" (III 1259). The line gets a useful gloss from a similar one in ShipT, VII177, where the wife of the merchant says to Daun John that of the six things women desire in husbands, two are that they be "fressh" (lively, lusty) and "buxom" (obedient) in bed. So there seems to be little question in WBT about defining sovereignty as sexual. For almost the same view, but from a prim Robertsonian perspective, see Bernard S. Levy, "The Wife of Bath's Queynte Fantasye," Chaucer Review 4 (1970): 106-22. 28.

Along similar lines, William of Conches, whose ideas were widely known, held that prostitutes who have sexual relations only for pay, and do not take plea sure in coition, have no emission of seed and for this reason do not conceive (Jacquart and Thomasset, Sexuality and Medicine, 63-64). The two-seed theory held sway beyond the Middle Ages and well into the early modern period. McLaren cites a 1690 edition of Aristotle's Masterpiece, a. compendium of popular lore on sexuality, on the importance of cli toral stimulation: "for without this, the fair sex neither desire mutual Embraces nor have pleasure in 'em, nor conceive by 'em" {Reproductive Rituals, 19). 42. If both Gower and Chaucer seem to take female sovereignty in a sexual sense, why does neither of their tales show it leading to pregnancy and childbirth? For one thing, according to an anonymous Latin prose treatise On Human Generation, derived from William of Conches's Dragmaticon, the pleasure of female orgasm and the consequent emis sion of seed is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for pregnancy (Cadden, Meanings, 96). But the more obvious reasons are literary: Florent is an exemplum in an alle gory of love designed to instruct an aging lover in the virtue of amatory humility, while WBT is the thinly disguised apologia of a postmenopausal woman who makes clear in her prologue that the Church's injunction to procreate has ironically never impinged on her ideal of marriage. 43.
