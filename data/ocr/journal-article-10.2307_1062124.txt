<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Middleton S E C R E C Y IN LUGBARA RELIGION I In this paper I discuss certain aspects of secrecy in one African religious system, that of the Lugbara of Uganda, from the view- point of a social anthropologist. I am therefore concerned pri- marily with the place of secrecy in the belief system and social organization, with emphasis on the analysis of it made by the members of that society. This is not easy, since the people only rarely make overt explanation of their own use of symbolic state- ments about social and individual experience. But the ethnog- rapher who stays long enough, can understand the language well enough, and knows the range of social structure and of cultural phenomena of the particular society subtly enough, can become at least reasonably competent in the analysis of a people's sym- bolic system. And the comparative knowledge of other symbolic systems is relevant and makes the task more feasible.1 The concept of secrecy, and (in some respects at least) the closely related con- cept of truth, are both clearly central in any system of religious An earlier draft of this paper was read at the annual meeting of the American Society for the Study of Religion held at the University of Chicago in April 1972. I am very grateful to the members of the society for their discussion and comments. I am also grateful to my friend Professor Thomas 0. Beidelman for comments and suggestions. Fieldwork among the Lugbara of Uganda was carried out from 1949 to 1953 with the support of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths and the Co- lonial Social Science Research Council, London. The field material was first written up with aid from the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, New York. 1 I am indebted here particularly to the work of Victor Turner, The Forest of Symbols (Ithaca, N.Y., 1967). 299</page><page sequence="2">Secrecy in Lugbara Religion thought. In this short paper I present what is only an introduction to them in this single religion. Although I believe that these remarks are in fact applicable in their significance to all religions, both within and outside Africa, I prefer here to devote the space available to me only to present the Lugbara ethnographic data without attempting to provide a comparative analysis. We may study secrecy as it occurs in many situations: as part of social process and change in the structure of society; as a means to political power; as a way to attain whatever the people consider to be the absolute truth that is not known to ordinary men but only to Divinity. As I see it, these are all interrelated and none is fully intelligible in isolation from the others. Secrecy may be associated with particular social groupings, as with so-called secret societies or the rites of initiation in which the initiands undergo rites of segregation, a period of seclusion or secrecy, and rites of aggre- gation.2 There are also forms of secrecy that are not associated with defined social groupings at all but which are rather the secrets of individuals. I do not try at the moment to define "secret," but take it to mean something that is unknown to or hidden from ordinary people, either by someone else, by God, or by some other spiritual power. I do, however, accept that one may speak of a secret only if other people are aware of it, although by definition they do not know its content or its meaning, although there are borderline cases in the existence of secret groups such as political plotters or criminals.3 In this paper I shall be concerned essentially with the nature and function of secrets in one particular society only, and I hope that their significance will become apparent. There is no need to give more than a brief outline of the Lugbara themselves.4 As an anthropologist I find that some idea of the basic structure of the society is necessary for an understanding of any aspect of their culture or religion. They are one of many small-scale African peoples, and live in northwestern Uganda and northeastern Zaire; they speak a Sudanic language, and number some quarter-million; they are peasant farmers living at a rela- 2 See, e.g., Arnold van Gennep, Rites de passage (Paris, 1909; trans., London, 1960); Max Gluckman, ed., Essays on the Ritual of Social Relations (Manchester, 1962); Kenneth Little, The 3Mende of Sierra Leone (London, 1951). 3 See the seminal work by George Simmel, "The Secret and the Secret Society" [1908]. reprinted in The Sociology of Georg Simmel, trans. and ed.

They lack traditional rulers or chiefs, although the latter have existed since the advent of colonial rule in the early years of this century. Until recently they have been little affected by Christianity or Islam, although both Catho- lic and Protestant missions have worked among them since about 1920. The culture is traditionally a preliterate one, and almost all older people are still illiterate: thus our knowledge of their religion can come only from firsthand conversation and observation. II The Lugbara have a series of closely related notions: "word" (e'yo); "truth" (a'da); "good" (onyi); "evil" (onzi); "untruth" or "lie" (enjo); and "secret" (zizaru). All these words need consider- able discussion, as simple translation is inadequate. The concept of "secret" is based on the verb zi, "conceal," especially in the sense of concealing something in darkness or in the brightness of the sky (as with stars in daytime).5 Its use in the sense of this paper is generally in the adjectival form zizaru, as in e'yo zizaru, "hidden or secret words." "Word" in Lugbara may refer to a word, literally, but much more widely to thoughts, behavior, or motives. The usage of "secret" is distinct from what we might better translate as "private," for which the phrase used is e'yo erini toko ("someone's words alone"), but there is an area of uncertainty between the two in both Lugbara and English. I must begin discussion of these concepts with mention of the cosmological background to Lugbara religious thought; one cannot study secrecy (or any other concept) in isolation from the re- mainder of the belief system. The Lugbara conceive of the world and of their experience of it as comprising three levels, in each of which man, or mankind, or some aspect of social beings, is opposed to and complementary to an aspect of Divinity or Spirit. I use these last words as translation of the Lugbara word Adro, which is central to this paper. One level is that of the entire universe, in both space and time. It was created by Adroa, the Creator Spirit or Divinity; the diminutive form -a is used because this aspect is remote from men on earth. It might be translated as God, but I find this misleading.6 Adroa created the world, man and woman, and animals; Adroa did not form society, which was done later 5 There are other dialectal forms: mgba, ndro, etc. Lugbara contains many dialects with markedly different vocabularies, but the variation in the form of individual words does not mean that their meanings vary. 6 I used the term "God" in Middleton, Lugbara Religion. 301</page><page sequence="4">Secrecy in Lugbara Religion by the two Hero-ancestors who socialized the asocial or presocial beings who were by then already in existence.7 Adroa is said to be "in the sky," "in the air," "in the wind," "outside" people; to be omnipotent, everlasting, invisible, beyond understanding or control by ordinary people. It is said that Adroa ma e'yo zizaru 'bua, "Adroa's words are secret, in the sky." The second level is that of the surface of the world, on which people of each small village community live surrounded by their homes and farms, in kin and local groups and separated from other like groups by stretches of unused land. Outside the homesteads and farms are the patches of woodland and forest, the riverbanks and riverbeds, the mountains and escarpments. All these places are the domain of the spirit known as Adro, an anthropomorphic aspect of Divine Spirit, tall, white in color, cut down the middle, and hopping about on its left leg. It is much feared and said to be "evil" as distinct from the "good" Creator Spirit. The third level is that of the individual human being, who contains three elements during his lifetime: the soul (orindi), the seat of family and kinship authority and responsibility; the tali or seat of personal influence over other people; and the adro, or spirit, the sign of man's divine creation and the element associated with individuality, idiosyn- crasy, and evil and antisocial behavior. Lugbara see their society and the world in which it is set in both space and time within the framework provided by this schema of the opposed and complementary spheres of the social and asocial, order and disorder, predictable and unpredictable, the "inner" and the "outside" (as Lugbara themselves say), at the three levels of experience.8 If nothing in society ever changed, then the schema would remain stable. But things do change all the time, both repetitively (as with births and deaths that disturb the particular pattern of organization and authority of an individual local com- munity) and radically or structurally (as with the advent of the Europeans or other long-term disasters that affect the balance of power among local groups throughout the entire system). To ex- plain, accommodate, and, to some extent, control this ever-chang- ing process, the Lugbara have recourse to various human agents who are thought to be able to move from one sphere to the other and back again. These agents are given various symbolic attri- 7 The myth of creation is described in Middleton, "Some Social Aspects of Lugbara Myth," Africa 24, no. 3 (1954): 189-99; and Lugbara Religion. 8 Further details of this dualistic schema are given in Middleton, "Some Cate- gories of Dual Classification among the Lugbara of Uganda," History of Religions 7, no. 3 (1968): 187-208. 302</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions butes, all of which are associated in one way or another with secrecy. I cannot here describe all of them, but it is useful to dis- cuss at least rainmakers, prophets, and diviners; other somewhat similar persons are blacksmiths and sorcerers.9 III Rainmakers (opi-ezo) are the most important ritual functionaries in Lugbara. There is one rainmaker in each of the sixty or so sub- clans, and they are structurally highly anomalous. On the one hand, a rainmaker is the most senior member of the subclan (a patrilineal group of some 4,000 people), and he thus provides a focal point for all the lineages that compose it. He is respected and consulted as an authority on important matters by ordinary elders of the subclan who are regarded as junior "brothers" to their rainmaker. On the other hand, he is given attributes that mark him off conceptually from ordinary people. The position normally passes to the rainmaker's eldest son, but it may pass to his sister's son if he has an elder sister. He thus has direct mystical descent from the clan founders, the sons of the original Hero-ancestors who formed Lugbara society, and his descent is of a different order from that of ordinary men. His powers include those of controlling the rain and of controlling epidemics (sent directly from Divine Spirit and not the consequences of petty sins of ordinary people that are followed by sickness sent by the ancestors); he could in the past stop feud and warfare by cursing the fighters (his curses are very powerful and are thought to cause sterility and barren- ness in humans, animals, and fields); he can provide sanctuary for a homicide. Thus, his powers have to do with fertility and the pre- vention of death, but not with ordinary lineage and family dis- putes that are dealt with by lineage elders, and he is not concerned with the propitiation of lineage ancestors, the duty of individual lineage elders. A rainmaker is not buried as are ordinary people. The corpses of ordinary people (except for infants, lepers, and those struck by lightning, which are merely thrown into the bushland) are placed 9 I have described these various personages elsewhere, from a slightly different viewpoint (see Middleton, "The Yakan or Allah Water Cult among the Lugbara," Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 93, no. 1 [1963]: 83-108; "Witchcraft and Sorcery in Lugbara," in Witchcraft and Sorcery in East Africa, ed.

The corpse is then covered with earth to dancing, singing, and drumming. On the other hand, a rainmaker is buried at nighttime in silence; he is not cursed by the living; at any sound it is thought he will turn into a leopard. But he is insulted by other rainmakers at his initiation as new rainmaker when he succeeds his predecessor. He is sent alone into what is to be his rain grove, at nighttime, and I have heard that he is also sent to wait by a stream in the wilderness, the domain of Adro. I have heard that "long long ago" it was cus- tomary for him also to be buried symbolically and dug up at his initiation. I have not myself witnessed these events, so can only report what was said to me; but whether or not they happen today, the symbolism is what is significant here. The rainmaker is, in a sense, socially dead. During the remainder of his life ideally he should not cut his hair or his fingernails,10 although in fact a rainmaker shaves his head and beard at ordinary times of family mourning and so on; he is socially "dead" only insofar as his formal ritual status is concerned. I need say rather less about prophets. The Lugbara prophets of which we know anything first appeared at the turn of the century and were believed to have the power to remove Europeans and certain epidemic sicknesses, both of them destructive to tra- ditional Lugbara society and interlinked in Lugbara thought. The greatest prophet was Rembe, a Kakwa from outside Lugbaraland. He lived in the country for a few months in 1916-17, and was later captured by the government and hanged. His power came directly from Divine Spirit in the form of sacred water, drawn from a pool and dispensed to his followers. It gave them everlasting life and would make them immune to bullets, as well as restore life to the ancestors and dead livestock. He introduced new forms of divina- tion by which he revealed the "words" of Divinity to his followers. These were organized on an egalitarian basis, the principles of organization being radically opposed to those of traditional society based on descent, age, and sex; all these principles were ignored according to the divine instructions received by the prophet. He was said to have powers of becoming invisible, of flying through the air, of being homosexual, and so on, and it is still believed that he 10 The significance of fingernails is widespread in this area; e.g., the neighboring Madi place the fingernails of dead chiefs in special pots that are used on ritual occasions (see Middleton, "Notes on the Political Organization of the Madi of Uganda," African Studies 14, no. 1 [1955]: 29-36). 304</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions did not die but will one day return to lead the Lugbara to peace, happiness, and a new society. Today prophets appear in the form of Christian evangelists, leading small groups or cells of women who have broken away from the Christian missions.1l Finally, diviners are women who are possessed by Divinity at puberty, when they run naked through the bushland in a state of trance. After that they are initiated by other diviners, a rite that includes symbolic burial and rebirth by passing through a bridged hole dug in the ground in the bushland. They practice either before puberty (although this is very rare), after the menopause, or if barren; that is, they are sexually neutral. They divine in the darkness of their huts, in private, often at night, in trance, and cure sicknesses sent directly by Spirit or spirits. They are also midwives and are used to contact the souls of dead men when the souls fly to Divinity in the sky and have to be redomesticated as ancestors and placed in shrines. They purify returning hunters when they come back from killing animals in the bushland, they purify those who have killed enemies in feud and warfare, and they practice other acts to do with the removal of pollution. These personages also possess or use material objects that may not be seen or touched by or discussed with ordinary people. They are thus secret, properly speaking they should be invisible, and, as might therefore be expected, they are dangerous and polluting to those who are not protected mystically from their powers. A rainmaker controls rain by manipulation of objects kept in a pot that is buried in the center of his rain grove.12 The grove itself consists of large trees, mainly fig trees, that may not be cut or used for collection of firewood, whether living or dead fallen wood. In the grove live leopards and snakes, both creatures closely associated with Divinity, as well as other wild animals. It is a piece of wilderness set in the midst of fields and farmlands. It is a "center of the world." 13 Only a rainmaker may enter it, the entrance often being concealed or at least not clearly marked by a pathway or cleared entrance. The rain pots contain various objects, kept covered by sesame oil.14 The objects vary from one rainmaker to 11 For a brief account of these evangelists, see Middleton, "Prophets and Rain- makers" (n. 9, above). 12 Not all rainmakers today possess proper rain groves, but all at least have a small area of wooded land that is known to be theirs alone and that is avoided by ordinary people. 13 See Mircea Eliade, The Myth of the Eternal Return (London, 1955). 14 Sesame (anyu) is an oil plant that is associated with many beliefs and taboos. It is the first-planted grain to be sown in the planting season, which is opened by the rainmaker. 305</page><page sequence="8">Secrecy in Lugbara Religion another, but as far as I know (I have been allowed to see a few) they include quartz rainstones, male and female; the vertebrae of snakes and birds; and beads and lip plugs of glass and obsidian. The quartz stones are known as si, the word used for hail, and they are thought both to fall directly from the sky and to have to be dug up from the earth. The bones are of creatures of more than one sphere-of the sky, the surface of the earth, and the earth itself beneath. The beads and lip plugs represent the sky (glass) and earth (obsidian), but both are alike in being shining, hard, and brittle. In addition, rainstones are both male and female (the former phallic in shape, the latter round and pierced); snakes and birds are thought in some respects to be hermaphroditic (I have heard also of rainmakers using hyena vertebrae, and hyenas are thought to be hermaphrodites); the lip plugs are phallic in shape, and the beads are round and pierced and so feminine. All these objects represent many facets of basic experience-to do with heaven and earth and the essential nature of human beings-and the reference may change according to a particular situation. Rainmakers say that together they represent the totality of human experience: "all the words of men, those of long ago, those of today, and those of tomorrow." Rainmakers control fertility and death by actual manipulation of these objects; I have seen them do so, although not at very close hand, and they have explained to me that they were carrying out Adroa ma azini, "the work of Adroa." Like Divinity, they thus create; and, an important point, like Divinity also it is they who decide the time to do this. Diviners act as doctors, curing sicknesses believed sent by Divine Spirit by sucking them out of the sick person's body; they draw out actual objects which they first secrete in their mouths or in twists of grass, and in which is captured the power of the sick- ness. Diviners are called ozou, from the word ozo, the bulb of a gladiolus-like plant which is found wild in the bushland and which grows, like an onion, half in the earth and half exposed to the air; it has bright flowers that, Lugbara point out, shine like the sky; and the bulb itself is crushed and drunk in water to produce a strong hallucinatory effect which Lugbara say is "like a dream," when one sees daylight activities in the nighttime. The objects secreted in their mouths are many, depending on the whim of the individual diviner, but they comprise objects that represent a confusion of the spheres of heaven, surface of the world, or earth- pieces of snake body and bones, worms and caterpillars, pieces of bird bone or beak, fungi, ants, pieces of quartz or obsidian, and 306</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions many small objects, such as shining stones and metal, exposed on the earth's surface. They are found by the diviner searching in the bushland and then brought home by her, thus also representing a link between wilderness and home. The other personages have similar objects; I need not go into much detail. Prophets got their power from the water of still pools (where a person is reflected and where he can see the sky by looking down into the earth), in which it is said lived monitor lizards and water snakes (from the earth beneath the water), with men's heads and colored like the rainbow. The prophet Rembe divined by throwing the skins of leopards, snakes, and hyenas, wild creatures that he thus symbolically domesticated. Sorcerers make sorcery medicines out of snakes, human placentae, the dust of corpses, fungi, and other materials; whether in fact anyone does actually use such things is uncertain and, in the context of this paper, irrelevant, since we are here concerned with the symbolism of the belief rather than its practice. Blacksmiths use alluvial iron, found in stream beds, and charcoal made from dead wood collected in the bushland. The symbolism in all these cases is clear enough. These materials are liminal, not totally within ordinary human understanding or control, things shown at least partially to men by Divinity. They are therefore dangerous and secret, hidden to ordinary people. Of course, most older men and women know something of them, their significance lying partly in the fact that their existence is known or surmised, but their spiritual and mysti- cal qualities are not understood. But even if ordinary people will talk about them, they will always add some such statement as "Perhaps I do not know of these 'words'; they are hidden and who can know the truth about them?" IV These figures, but particularly the rainmakers, are also associated with timelessness and what we might somewhat loosely call the absolute truth. It is said that the activities of rainmakers to do with fertility and death are like those of the personages of myth. These were several generations of siblings, the last pair of whom gave birth to the two Hero-ancestors, the fathers of the clan found- ers who were the original rainmakers. During the mythical period people knew no kinship, no legitimacy of sexual relations, no marriage, no feud or warfare (the bases of traditional jural relations). When myths are related, it is sometimes said that the 307</page><page sequence="10">Secrecy in Lugbara Religion Heroes did die and are buried each on the top of one of the two mountain peaks in central Lugbaraland, Mounts Eti and Liru. But it is often said that they resembled the previous mythical siblings, whose deaths are not mentioned in the myths. People say of the Heroes, "Perhaps they did not die, and those graves on the mountains are of other people; who can know of these things?" Being in both the presocial and the later social periods of myth, whether they died (and so had to observe the passing of time) depends on which aspect of the myth is being emphasized in a particular telling of it: the creation of the world or the formation of society as it is today. Being before the formation of society, or at least only at its very beginning, there was no social process, no development or change, no passing of time. Rainmakers especially are said also to be associated with the truth. "Truth" (a'da) or "true words" (e'yo a'daru) have two usages in Lugbara speech. Elders are said to attempt to speak the truth when formally practicing ritually and hedged with taboos that remove them from the ordinary world of social relations and time. Rainmakers, however, are said always to speak the truth. The notion here is that in ordinary situations men cannot speak or think the absolute truth but can only speak or think what they think it to be: they do their best but the truth is always ultimately hidden from them. They are ignorant of it and can see their society only in sectional terms, those of the processes of lineage segmenta- tion and local change. On the other hand, rainmakers do know the absolute truth. They are concerned with the perpetuation of clans that compose the total social system without reference to the everyday petty changes within these groups. They are linked with and are, as it were, extensions of the mythical Heroes. They stand outside the vicissitudes of change, growth, and death. It is significant here that the truth may also be known, at least to a greater extent than by ordinary people, by those who are temporarily in a state of possession or trance, such as prophets and diviners. It is important to add that the "truth" is not conceived by Lugbara as applied to a proposition that is either true or not true, but that the truth attaches to a particular status or situation.15 It is clear that all these personages have certain attributes in common. They are associated with asexuality, with timelessness, 15 The discussion in this paper of truth and timelessness is brief and somewhat perfunctory, although important to the main theme. I intend shortly to publish another paper on the Lugbara notions of time and truth. I should like to mention the valuable paper by Wilfred Cantwell Smith, "A Human View of Truth," Studies in Religion 1, no. 1 (1971): 6-24. 308</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions with truth; they are regarded with great awe and often with fear; they are uncanny, bizarre in dress and appearance; and of all of them it is said that "their words are secret." People make such statements about them as "We people cannot understand them, they are far from us, they know the words of Divinity that are hidden from us." In brief, they possess secret knowledge of the truth, the nature of Divinity, the world, and man. However, there are significant distinctions between rainmakers on the one hand and prophets and diviners on the other. One is that rainmakers are hereditary, acquiring their powers by direct succession from the Hero-ancestors to whom these powers were entrusted by Divine Spirit. On the other hand, prophets are non- hereditary charismatic figures whose powers come to them in nontraditional and unexpected ways, by forms of revelation. Diviners are similar; the propensity to possession seems usually to pass from a woman to her daughters-but being in the female line this is not regarded as true succession, which in this society can only be patrilineal. A second distinction is that rainmakers hold and keep certain divine secrets, whereas prophets and diviners reveal secrets to their followers and clients. The political power of a rainmaker lies precisely in that fact: without him the society cannot persist, but it cannot get the secret behind that power from him. The power of a prophet is different, and people use him to gain secrets for their own understanding of their experience; diviners are similar although far less powerful. A third distinction is that rainmakers are essentially priests, associated with main- tenance of the status quo; prophets are innovators, associated with change and the bringing of peace. Routinization of prophetic power is through its acceptance or accommodation by rain- makers.16 V To possess a secret means that one has the power to reveal it, either to harm others or as a means of manifesting divine or mysti- cal power to others. To Lugbara, the former is unusual and is not really within the scope of this paper. To tell a "lie" (enjo) is in a sense to reveal a secret in the situation given by Lugbara, that a man tells lies about the relative power of his lineage group in competition with others. A lie is like a feud, a weapon that is 16 See Middleton, "Prophets and Rainmakers" (n. 9, above). 309</page><page sequence="12">Secrecy in Lugbara Religion morally neutral-the one makes use of what may turn out to be secret knowledge, the other makes use of physical force. The second kind of revelation is relevant here. It is found especially in two situations, that of the personages of myths, and that of prophets (as I have said, rainmakers do not reveal secrets). The Lugbara myth of origin tells of a time before the formation of society as it is today by the two Hero-ancestors, but after the creation of the world, of animals, and of people by the Creator. The pairs of siblings who were placed on earth17 revealed the knowl- edge of sexual intercourse, fire, pottery making, cattle keeping, agriculture, papyrus-mat making, magical medicines of many kinds, and the knowledge that makes social life possible. Lugbara say that these skills, which are still associated with rituals that include secret behavior (for example, first fruits, firemaking for a new hut, pottery taboos, consummation of a marriage, and so on) were "words that were hidden" to be revealed as a sign of sociali- zation of men into members of society. Likewise, the mystical healing by the Hero-ancestors of autochthonous leper women, making them into complete women whom they married and who bore the sixty Lugbara clan founders, was also the consequence of the revelation of secret knowledge. In a somewhat similar way, the prophet Rembe revealed the secrets of Divine power in pools of water; these gave him the knowledge of new egalitarian forms of social organization for his cult members, a knowledge that sanc- tioned his charismatic authority (that is, a form of unsocialized power). And today, separatist evangelists try to find secrets for a new society in trances (when Divinity will reveal secrets to their followers through glossolalia) or in study of the Bible (where they can find secrets for themselves.)l8 VI It would seem likely, if not obvious, that the secret tends to be remote from ordinary everyday experience and to be alien, either in the nature of the attributes given to a secret object or in a more literal sense of belonging to a member of an alien group. 17 But outside the present-day Lugbaraland, far in the wilderness. 18 Here, in the notion of the revelation to men of secret knowledge by Divinity, we come to a question that is posed by comparative studies which is clearly of considerable importance but which I cannot go into in this short paper. The Lugbara myths tell of Divinity revealing secrets to men; the myths of many other peoples tell of men stealing secrets from Divinity, often (perhaps usually) by a trick. The significance of this distinction merits some study. 310</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions This aspect of secrecy may be seen in Lugbara thought in two situations. The first is that of a stranger, an alien or foreign individual, anyi'ba. A stranger has no known or recognized kin or lineage ties but comes into a community as a client, alone and empty-handed, from the bushland; he attaches himself to a wealthy host and in time may be given a daughter to marry and so become a "sister's husband" and fully absorbed into the group. Or he may at first be killed with impunity, and his body thrown into the bushland. It is said that a newly arrived stranger has "secret words," and he is much feared. Although he is poor and alone, he may in fact turn out to be a prophet, or a witch or sorcerer, or he may be a new kind of diviner. No one knows, and so he has considerable power, although no authority. In a very similar way blacksmiths, who are Ndu and never Lugbara and so alien, are always "strangers." They possess secret knowledge of transforming natural forms of metal into artifacts, and they also have powers of cursing that are much feared: both forms of secret knowledge have been handed down to them from the time of myth. The second example of the alienness of the secret is more com- plex. Divine Spirit is secret, by implication, and unknown, "in the sky" and "in the wind." Divine secrets are revealed by proph- ets, each of whom is associated with a particular spirit, which is thought to possess him. These spirits are aspects or refractions of Divine Spirit and, after the decline of the particular prophet, become more generalized and can attack and possess anyone; they are then brought under control by a diviner. These several lesser spirits are explicitly known by individual names; these refer either to their being able to possess people and make them tremble (as with Rembe's spirit, Yakan, from the verb 'ya, "to shake"), or to their secrecy (as with the older and famous spirits Mmua and Ndindia, which come from the roots mu and ndi-both meaning "to hide"). These spirits would seem all to represent the final stages of former prophetic cults, whose prophets are dead or gone else- where and whose powers have become routinized and assimilated by rainmakers and diviners. Although historical evidence is very weak or lacking, it would seem that this process can at least be conjectured for the distant past and to some extent demonstrated for the recent past. As the spirit grows more distant in time from its original "possessor" and so more autonomous and more transcendent, so it acquires a more clearly attributed secrecy. It also acquires a clearly alien attribution in the sense that it is 311</page><page sequence="14">Secrecy in Lugbara Religion associated by Lugbara with a particular foreign and distant clan or people, which is said to "own" the spirit and thus in some way to know it and control its secret power.19 VII To summarize so far, the basic notion about secrecy held by the Lugbara is a simple one: that the realm of Divine Spirit and the powers associated with it (especially those of creation and death) are secret, unknown to ordinary people. To accommodate these powers there are certain personages who are themselves possessed of at least some degree of secret power. They are liminal, danger- ous, and so on; their attributes are asexuality, silence, darkness, association with the wilderness, deathlessness, timelessness, and truth; and they are not subject to control and comprehension by ordinary people. They are dangerous and thus structurally invisi- ble when playing these roles, masked as it were. Lugbara do not make or wear masks as a sign of secret power, but the use made of dark oils, white and red clay and paint, and bizarre dress and appearance is of the same order. Essentially, the secret objects and their owners are intermediaries between Divinity and men and are also concerned with power and change; they are thus intermediaries in both space and in time, to use our own concepts. They are links between the social and the asocial or antisocial; that is, they are agents in the resolution of the paradoxes and "scandals" that arise in human experience. Secrecy is thus associated with power and change, as distinct from authority and stability. Change is the process of moving from one state to another, a process marked by a period of seclusion or liminality. This is associated with secrecy, truth, timelessness, and so on. There is, of course, a political aspect to all this: those pos- sessed of secret knowledge exercise power over others precisely because of that knowledge. It is thus necessary if the continual threats to social stability are to be countered and controlled peacefully. Here we return to very old concepts in anthropology and history, those of structure and antistructure. Antistructure is found in Lugbara society on certain occasions. These are the ac- tivities of prophets; the large gatherings for planting and especi- ally for harvesting festivals conducted by rainmakers, marking the 19 I have discussed these spirits in greater detail in "The Yakan or Allah Water Cult" (n. 9, above); "Spirit Possession among the Lugbara," in Spirit Mediumship and Society in Africa, ed. J. Beattie and J. Middleton (London, 1969); and "Proph- ets and Rainmakers" (n. 9, above). 312</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions changes from scarcity to plenty and all the social activities that go with it; the rare gatherings summoned when rainmakers pray to Divinity for the removal of epidemics and send scapegoats to the wilderness to bring rain, thus marking the change from sickness to health and changes in the relative strengths of local groups affected by the epidemics; and, on a smaller scale, the death dances held by members of a subclan. These are all occasions in which the central ritual activity-of prophet, rainmaker, or sacrificing elder -include acts that are secret from other people, as I have men- tioned above. Lugbara add that the "words" of the ordinary people attending these rites are also "not known," that is, that the differences of authority and other statuses are at least partially not recognized. For example, all these are occasions when clan incest occurs (or at least is said to occur), or is permitted, an act that is otherwise regarded with abhorrence. VIII A point that merits far fuiller discussion than I can give it here is that of the nature and relationship between secrecy, time, and truth. Lugbara say that the truth is secret, in the sense that it is concerned with relationships between people and between people and Divinity that are known only to Divinity, to rainmakers and prophets, and, to a lesser extent, to diviners. The distinctions among these practitioners made above are significant here. The truth, in this sense, is knowledge that is capable of changing and indeed of devastating all categories and thus all relationships. It must therefore be carefully bounded and controlled. One aspect of this quality is that it cannot be spoken to ordinary people; indeed, it cannot be spoken at all in the sense that it is unspeakable, there being no language known to men that is capable of translat- ing it. Lugbara say that at one time, at the beginning of the world, men could move from earth to the sky, and back again, by means of a tower, a tree, or a rope. They were not cut off from Divinity. However, the tower was destroyed, people fell to the ground, and in place of speaking the single common language that they spoke formerly and which enabled them to talk with Divinity, they found themselves divided into tribes each with its own language. Since then people do not know or understand divine secrets. When a secret is revealed to them by prophets, evangelists, and to a lesser extent by diviners, it is revealed by glossolalia: these personages go into trance and speak with tongues. I have been 313</page><page sequence="16">Secrecy in Lugbara Religion told by diviners that they themselves do not know what they say and that they transform things that they see (in trance) into words; they transform sight into sound, and so confuse and trans- late these basic categories of experience. It is relevant also that the rainmaker's secret objects are never seen by ordinary people, but those of prophets and diviners are seen. The rainmaker is not a teacher but a custodian; the others' main role is to give out se- crets that can be interpreted both by themselves and by those who hear them. I should like here to return to consider a little further the Lugbara notion of time. The sphere of the Divine or "outside" has no time in the sense of the structured time of everyday social life: that of the passing of generations, years and seasons, months, days, and nights. It is regarded as a sphere of timelessness. The sphere of social order, however, has to recognize time. The main implication is that men lack knowledge of what is time; although they have to live by it, they cannot control it, and they are therefore susceptible to death. Divinity does, however, have this knowledge: Divinity can create and destroy life at will, can introduce new forms of life and death (as the advent of Europeans and epidemics). Men can do none of these things but must merely suffer death, and even must do so without knowing when or how it will come to them. But there are two exceptions. One is the rainmaker, who as I have said, is, in a sense, himself beyond death and whose activities have to do with the control of death. The other is a prophet, who is thought never to die but to be waiting secretly to return at the proper time, a time that only he knows and reveals in his own time. Diviners can in a sense also cope with death, but that is all: they cannot control it nor are they themselves above it. But rainmakers and prophets share the divine secret knowledge of time. They can break down the units of time: rainmakers are thought to control it by controlling times of planting and harvesting, and prophets did the same and handed the knowledge on to a slight extent to their successors, the owners of Yakan sticks. And to control time is to conquer death. This of course leads to the last point I wish to make, the whole relationship in Lugbara thought between secrecy and social order and social existence. Like all societies, Lugbara society is based on an ordered system of moral and social categories. If society is to continue in order and stability, these categories must remain without confusion. Yet there is in fact always confusion between them, for two reasons. One is that changes are always occurring in 314</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions actuality: the ordered structure of social relations that is society is affected by various factors that the Lugbara see as emanating from outside the social altogether. Categories are thus confused- Lugbara say that both change itself and the agents who can cope with it by being able to sort out the confusion of categories and the resulting pollution and danger are onzi, "evil." But the con- fusion can nonetheless be sorted out by them and the pollution removed. The second reason is that ordinary people confuse cate- gories by themselves, by their own evil or selfish or stupid be- havior; they thus pollute their society and have to turn again to the same agents (especially to diviners). People confuse categories by ignorance, even if their short-term motives are selfish. Ordinary people do not know the secrets of Divinity. The essential part of secret knowledge is that its possessor can reshuffle or re-form a system of categories (and this, of course, is the basis of any kind of power), and Lugbara say explicitly that only Divinity can do this; his living extensions, rainmakers and prophets, can understand it and are delegated a good deal of resultant power, but they are nonetheless still only Adroa ma anzi, "children of Divinity." Without categories there can be no social system, no ordered social life. Again, Lugbara quite explicitly contrast social beings with those of the wilderness. The latter have no society because they have no categories (although they exist themselves in categories, as birds are said to live in clans, and so on); but that is something else. To some extent the beasts have secret knowledge (a feature of animal beliefs throughout the world), and certainly Lugbara say that those beasts linked in some particular way with Divinity have something of the nature of leaders. They are the anomalous ones: leopards (the same as rainmakers, night animals, and physically spotted so confused in that sense); elephants (who never die); hyenas (night animals, spotted, and hermaphroditic); pythons; and others-the list of anomalous beasts is virtually the same in all societies and hardly merits discussion here. It is not strange that these are the beasts that have power over men, since they share to some degree in Divinity and its secrets, although only to a limited and hardly real extent. IX In conclusion, I have shown that for Lugbara what is secret, hidden from ordinary men, is associated with Divinity. Men can- not understand the secret, and thus cannot control it, except (to 315</page><page sequence="18">Secrecy in Lugbara Religion a limited extent) rainmakers and prophets. The secret is the source of all power, of the basic divine power that can create and change social and natural categories. Since the separation, long ago, of men from Divinity, it is men who have had to cope alone with the consequences of divine power in processes of change and develop- ment. Therefore, some men (rainmakers, prophets, diviners) have had to be allowed by Divinity to participate to some extent in the exercise of that power. They must have secret knowledge or at least be able to use the secret objects and words even if they do not fully understand them. I have presented anl outline account of certain notions held by a single African people. In itself this schema is internally consistent (especially in the sense that the social and religious are so one with each other), and it provides a means by which Lugbara can resolve the more obvious and important paradoxes and "scandals" that they have to face under continually changing ecological and his- torical conditions. Clearly, no other society in the world has exactly the same set of notions, but the underlying pattern is widespread and, in one way or another, universal. As an anthro- pologist, I am interested in the variations found in other societies, and in the factors that produce those variations. For example, Lugbara do not practice any elaborate form of initiation at pu- berty, at which seclusions of initiands and the inculcation of secret knowledge to them by using secret objects is a central part; nor do they use masks to any extent to represent secrecy and to protect people from its dangers as do many African peoples as a central part of rituals involving spirit possession. In one sense their culture is perhaps comparatively free of rigid boundaries between social and moral categories so that the people have few situations of categorical confusion and pollution; therefore they have rela- tively little need for masquerades or elaborate means of concealing and thus protecting themselves from the dangers of divine secrecy. We need comparative studies involving these and related concepts and problems for our further understanding. New York University 316</page></plain_text>
