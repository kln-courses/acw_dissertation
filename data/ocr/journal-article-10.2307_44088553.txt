<plain_text><page sequence="1">POLEMICS, OLD TESTAMENT, AND THEOLOGY A STUDY OF II COR., Ill , 1 - IV, 6 Paul's attitude vis-à-vis Judaism generally, and his Jewish background in particular, has generated considerable scholarly discussion. 1 His negative evaluation of the law at times contrast very sharply with the respect and pride he manifests toward his religious background. Even in polemical contexts, Paul under- scores his Jewish heritage, e.g., II Cor., xi, 22-23. Characteristic of this Jewishness is the preponderant use and inspiration of scripture in all his letters. 2 In effect, there are numerous quotations and a long list of short biblical excerpts and reminiscences throughout II Corinthians. 8 The facility with which he employs the various books of the OT is evident, whether to 1 Among others see: W.

Earlier scholars like J. Goettsberger have noted that for II Cor., hi Paul draws from Ex., xxxiv the imagery and theological base of his argument. 6 While it is typical of him to appeal to the OT in the course of his writing, it is somewhat unusual that in II Cor., hi he should make such extensive use of the OT and particularly of one scriptural passage. Sensing a lack of unity in analyzing ch. in and, no doubt, attempting to account for the prolonged used of Ex., xxxiv, H. Windisch concluded that vv. 7-18 were a midrash on Ex., xxxiv and constituted a momentary tangent in Paul's apology. 6 Similarly, S. Schulz maintained that Paul had modified a pre-existing midrash and proceeded to isolate Pauline from non-Pauline elements. 7 More recently, D. Georgi has taken up this view in his discussion of Paul's Corinthian opposition, proposing that Paul had appropriated his enemies' composition and had interwoven his own interpretation into this text to defend himself and his apostolate against wandering Jewish missionaries. 8 It should be pointed out, however, that Paul employs several other OT passages in his composition, Ex., xxxi, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and probably Proverbs, in relation to the question of credentials; Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Exodus, and Wisdom, in regard to the new covenant; and Isaiah at the beginning of II Cor., iv, in support of his conception of the Christian ministry. This paper will, therefore, examine the relationship of Paul's text to the LXX passages noted and analyze the use which he makes of his sources in formulating his argument. While admittedly there are distant similarities with targumic expansions of the OT, particularly of Exodus, 9 it will be demonstrated that Paul's text owes its inspi- ration and source to the LXX and its idiom. 4 Lindars, Place of the Old Testament , p. 63. • Die Hülle des Moses nach Ex 34 und 2 Kor 3, in BZ, XVI, 1922-24, pp. 1-17. • Die zweite Korinther brief, 9th ed., Göttinnen, 1924, p. 105. 7 Die Decke des Moses.

Barrett, in concluding his discussion of II Cor., iii, 6, remarks: "The contrast he has now stated in the simplest terms Paul proceeds to elaborate in a midrash on Exod. xxxiv, 28-35." 10 Doubtless, it is customary, under the influence of Windisch, to consider II Cor., iii, 7-18 a midrash on Ex., xxxiv, 28-35 either of Pauline or pre-Pauline authorship. While the position outlined by Windisch has received little acceptance, his observations on ch. iii have had a profound effect on subsequent scholarship. Either scholars have adopted the notion of midrash to account for the extended use of Exodus, or they have rallied to the idea of discontinuity by positing a pre-Pauline source. In the first case, use of the term "midrash" is widespread, although serious consideration of the genre and its techniques have rarely drawn the attention of scholars, who are content to underscore Pauline authorship. 11 Only J. D. G. Dunn, presumably, has attempted to demonstrate the midrashic character of II Cor., iii, 7-18. He maintains that Paul's text is a Christian midrash and that iii, 16, consisting of an intentionally modified quotation of Ex., xxxiv, 34, is best described as a pesher similar to the targums and the lxx (i.e., interpretive alteration) rather than to that of Qumran (lQpHab ). 12 One can surely agree that v. 16 is an explicit citation and that the modifications are intentional, but one must question the wisdom of such a broad definition of midrash as well as the interchange of this term with pesher. More attention should have been given to the hermeneutical techniques employed and more discernment exhibited in the use of the term "midrash," a term which refers primarily to literary genre. Indeed, the impre- cise use of such vocabulary is common in NT studies. 18 10 The Second Epietle to the Corinthians, New York, 1973, p. 113. u R. Bloch, Midrash, in Dictionnaire de la Bible.

A text which originally stressed the glory of Moses or, in Georgi's terms, celebrated him as a theios aner, becomes in the hands of Paul a polemical weapon to subjugate Moses and his devotees to the Christian dispensation. A most pointed criticism of this view is given by J.-F. Collange, who, while still maintaining the polemical character of hi, 7f., argues that the theory is unnecessary. He rejects correctly as simplistic the notion that Paul would have had access to the writings of his opponents and would have felt obliged to refute these in detail. He also finds objectionable the idea that Paul should have employed so "cavalier a method,' ' one which displays none of his customary subtlety and dynamism. 16 Equally direct is the treatment of C. J. A. Hickling who insists that such theories "indicate great ingenuity on the part of their authors (as well as claiming an even greater ingenuity for Paul himself, and attributing remarkable exegetical sensitivity to his readers in Corinth) but leave one with the impression that the wrong questions have been asked of the text."16 To the above we might add that the passage in question has never convincingly been structurally analyzed as a midrash. further: W.

RICHARD That Paul utilizes Ex., xxxiv to formulate his argument or that he reads more into the text than was intended (vv. 13 and 16) is not in doubt; but what is at issue is the literary character either of Paul's text or of the hypothetical "enemy midrash."17 Further, the method used both by Schulz and Georgi in arriving at the alleged Corinthian source is questionable. In the words of Collange: "le principe est un peu simplet qui consiste à faire ce tri : ce terme est très paulinien donc... celui-ci ne l'est pas (XÎ0oç ? 7cpô&lt;Kû7tov ? dkevtaat ?) donc..." 18 It is clearly indicated that recent scholars tend to reject the notion of a pre-Pauline text in ch. iii. 19 Nonetheless, the funda- mental questions posed by Windisch retain their urgency, namely, why the extended use of Ex., xxxiv and how resolve the problem of structural unity? In light of the above observations, therefore, a reappraisal of II Cor., hi, 1 - iv, 6 is in order. II COR., iii, 1-3 The polemical statement of II Cor., n, 17, labeling his opponents profiteers (xamijXeúovTeç), 20 leads Paul in self-defense to discuss the problem of letters of recommendation. 21 Making use of letter imagery, he is led from polemics, to self-defense, to the basic truths of Christian life and ministry, all the while freely allowing his mind to draw from the OT concepts suited to his purpose. In the words of Käsemann: "It is characteristic of Paul's method 17 The term "enemy midrash" is taken from Jewett, Paul's Anthropological TermSy p. 329; note that Georgi studiously avoids the term "midrash." 18 Collange, Enigmes , p. 68. 19 Among others, A.

Not only does "profiteers" (v. 17) announce the self-defense of in, 1-3 regarding letters of recommendation, but 1) Ixavóç (ii, 16) leads to the important statement of in, 4-6 where the same root is used three times; 2) t&lt;¡&gt; 7uávTOTe 0pi&lt;xp.6eóovTi f)p.ãç prepares for toiocótiqv èXníSa. of iii, 12; 3) çavepouvTi 8i f)px5v (v. 14) and ¿v Xptcmo XaXoupev (with the many references to áiaxovíoc in in, 6-9) lay the foundation for t9)v Siaxoviocv to còrrçv of iv, 1; and 4) xoc7n)Xeóovreç tòv Xóyov tou 0eou is taken up again by a synonym in iv, 2: SoXouvreç tòv Xóyov tou 0eou (both translated in the Vulgate: adulterantes verbum dei) - see H.

' 22 Paul's self-defense leads him in an astute use of letter imagery to discourse upon the nature of the Corinthian community. His agile mind, drawing various letter-related concepts from the LXX and employing numerous participial and o ůx/áXXá constructions composes one of the most beautiful passages of the NT. It is at this point (v. 3), according to numerous scholars, that Paul delves into the OT for a rich variety of letter-related concepts in his quest for a proper description of the Christian community. 23 These scholars conclude that Paul here appeals to Ex., xxxi, 18 and other OT texts as authoritative illustrations or fulfillment of prophecy. 24 Moreover, they usually relate the use of heart imagery in v. 3 to the influence of Jer., xxxviii, 33 and/or Ezek., xi, 19 (= xxxvi, 26). Since Paul has already employed the term "heart" in v. 2 and, indeed, in a form which more closely approximates Jer., xxxviii, 33 than does v. 3, a reexamination of the passage in question is required. II Cor., in, 1, concerning letters of recommendation, constitutes the setting in Paul's life which calls forth the key state- ment of v. 2. In the heat of controversy, Paul momentarily considers his opponents' or, preferably, the Corinthians' charge in regard to credentials 25 and concludes that his are superior.

RICHARD community itself. This initial play on words by a series of qualifying participial phrases becomes a pointed theological declaration. This is no common letter, but one written on the heart.

" On the one hand, the transfer of ypáçco to èyypáçcú would have been facilitated by current usage, as in the papyri (J. H. Moulton &amp; G. Milligan, The Vocabulary of the Greek Testament Illustrated from the Papyri and Other Nonliterary Sources , Grand Rapids, 1930/70, p. 178), especially for v. 3: "written not with ink" (Arndt-Gingrich- Danker, Greek-English Lexicon , p. 214); however, the combination ¿yyp¿?&lt;»&gt; ¿v in vv. 2 and 3 would suggest the meaning "engrave/inscribe": "letter engraved on our hearts" and "engraved... not on stone tablets but on tablets" (see the examples given in Liddell-Scott-Jones, Greek-English Lexicon , p. 468 and Arndt-Gingrich- D anker, supra). On the other hand, the modification of ¿7ul x. (acc.) to èv x. (dat.) should be seen in light of NT usage, where "in/on the heart" (not " into the heart" = èrrl x. [acc.]) is always expressed by the second construction (very frequent in Paul: I Cor., vii, 37; II Cor., i, 22, etc.; see Rom., x, 8 =Deut., xxx, 14 with èv x.), except in Heb., viii, 10; x, 16 - ¿7ul x. (acc.) where both instances are citations of Jer., xxxviii, 33. Besides èîd x. (acc.) has a different meaning for Paul as in II Cor., iii, 15: "a veil lies over their heart" (parallel to v. 13: "veil over his toce"- Ex., xxxiv, 33/35). Plummer, Second Epistle, p. 80, makes a very important observation in this</page><page sequence="8">A STUDY OF II COR., Ill, 1-IV, 6 347 In v. 3 Paul addresses himself to the concept of ' 'letter written on the heart* * by composing a short commentary on v. 2, in effect treating each term in turn: bizwrzo X9) Tjfiôv, è-f^YP0^^7)? an(^ xotpSíaiç. Each expression is repeated in v. 3 and, in its original order of appearance, is provided with further elaboration. Employing the hermeneutical rule of gezerah shawah , one of the famous "midoth of Hillel," Paul associates the two terms of the quotation from Jeremiah (éyysrfpoí[L[Lhrr¡ and xocpSíaiç) with two scriptural passages presenting the same terms. 30 By analogy of theme, therefore, Paul assimilates to the citation from Jeremiah new biblical texts to formulate his own statement. The first part of v. 3 is clearly apologetic since the letter (e7ui&lt;rro XÝj) is said to be written by Christ and delivered or supplied by Paul (read tjjjuov for v. 2 81 and interpret SiaxovyjOetaa as "bearer* * or possibly "provider**). 32 The element of divine agency, emplasized by Jeremiah ("I shall write'*), leads Paul to clarify the origin of the ministry (subjective genitive: letter by Christ) 33 and his role therein (èç* Yjficov). Following this, he addresses himself to the other elements drawn from Jeremiah . In a manner typical of the exegesis of the period, he employs the OT to elucidate the OT. 84 To interpret eyyeYpafxpivT), he has recourse to the writing par excellence - that of Sinai. His immediate source Ex ., xxxi, 18 is as follows: regard: "Note the change from perf. to pres. participles"). See also Collange, Énigmes, pp. 47-48 and Barrett, Second Epistle, p. i 07. #0 The technique described as "tallying" would be an apt description for this phenomenon; see J. Mann, The Bible as Read and Preached in the Old Synagogue, I, New York, 1940 (1971), pp. 11-16. 11 *H(X6&gt;v is certainly the better attested and probably original reading. Baird's discussion, Letters of Recommendation, pp. 166-72, followed by Collange, Énigmes, pp. 46-47, is quite convincing. n The term StaxovrjOetoa has been variously interpreted as 1) "amanuensis," "writer" (letter imagery), and therefore "minister" (the usual meaning of Staxovia) ; 2) "preacher of good news" (in response to itinerant missionary preacher opponents); 3) "courier" or "deliverer of a message" (letter of recommendation imagery); and 4) "supplier" or "producer" of the letter. A combination of three and four seems to serve the context and Paul's theology best. On the one hand, the letter is of divine origin and Paul its courier and, on the other, it is Paul, not his opponents, who has brought this letter/community into being.

Paul transforms the °í the LXX to eYYSYpaWiévY), the form employed earlier in v. 2. From the outset it is obvious that he is committed to developing the letter imagery enunciated in vv. l-3a. To that end, it is stated that the letter is written not with ink (letter versus stone-tablet) but by the Spirit of the living God. The latter is clearly a transformation of the Exodus text "written by the finger of God," since even the instrumental dative of the source is retained. The remainder of the verse, while pursuing the letter imagery noted above, reintroduces that of heart from v. 2. The letter of Christ is written not on stone tablets, like the Ten Commandments, but on a different kind of tablet - i.e., hearts of flesh. The re- introduction of the term "heart" ' leads Paul to other OT texts which are called into service to complement his own statement. Before considering the use which Paul makes of these new texts, it should be noted that the Exodus passage has left its mark on II Cor., iii, 3, not only in the realm of ideas and images, but also in that of grammar and style: (iy)YSYpa[Apiv7), double instrumental dative, double occurrence of the noun 7cXáÇ in the plural, and the use of apposition (êv 7uXa£lv, xapSíaiç aapxívaiç - two tablets of witness, i.e., stone tablets written...). Such observations further emphasize the importance of Paul's Jewish background and knowledge of the Greek bible in understanding not only his theo- logy but even his style and thought patterns. To complement his idea that the community is a letter written on the heart, Paul draws two important concepts from Ezek ., xi, 19/ xxxvi, 26: xal Sco aça auTOiç/úpuv xapSíav eTépav/xatv/jv xal rozsupła xaivòv Scíxro) êv auTOÏç/upuv xal éxo7uá(TCú/á&lt;peX¿ú t})v xapSíav t?)v Xi0ívyjv èx t9)ç capxòç aÒTÔv/upuõv xal Scíhtcú aÔTOLç/ufJuv xapSíav aapxívTjv. First, it seems fair to assume that the idea of agency of the Spirit derives drom this OT passage and has prompted Paul to modify the overly anthropomorphic expression "by the finger of God" to a more literary and theologically appropriate statement. And secondly, the expression "heart of flesh" undeniably comes from Ezekiel. These concepts have been incorporated within the creative</page><page sequence="10">A STUDY OF II COR., Ill, 1-IV, 6 349 commentary on Jer., xxxviii, 33 which Paul is composing in reaction to, and in light of, the Words of Sinai. In summary, Paul in II Cor., m, 1-3 exploits the theme of Jer., xxxviii, 33 which he cites in v. 2. (Note the further influence of Jer., xxxviii, 31, "new covenant," on II Cor., hi, 6). Verse 3a constitutes a restatement by Paul of divine agency, while 3b and 3c, consisting of a double o úx/áXXá construction, address the two other elements of the citation. 3b concerns instrument (double dative) and 3c deals with place where (double èv, the same pre- position employed in v. 2). Furthermore, actualization, an impor- tant characteristic of Jewish exegesis, 38 is realized in two ways: (1) by the direct application of the text to the audience and writer ("you are the letter" and "delivered by us") and (2) by the careful interweaving of personal and ecclesiological elements. Finally, the varied imagery of iii, 1-3 finds its fundamental unity in the concept of letter, of recommendation, 38 a concept which Paul has exploited with considerable adeptness. Basically, Paul pursues one theme, that of letter, a theme which governs his choice of OT passages. This selection is done "by a process of association." II COR., m, 4-6 Having satisfactorily resolved the issue concerning letters of recommendation, Paul resumes in vv. 4-6 the defense of his ministry; 37 he possesses confidence not on account of personal competence but because God has made him so. 38 This line of 38 Ibid., col. 1266 and Wright, Midrash, pp. 74-75. 33 While some scholars, following the lead of Windisch, Zweite Koriniher brief, p. 105, maintain that Paul here inserts a totally different image, that of Himmelsbrief (Georgi, Gegner, p. 253; Käsemann, Perspectives, pp. 148-50; and Hickling, Sequence, p. 383, among others), it is preferable to appeal to the ouaTOCTWcal ¿7rioToXai of iii, 1 as providing the unity of imagery for iii, 1-3 (also Baird, Letters of Recommendation, p. 170) as well as the dynamic link between the autobiographical and ecclesiological elements of the passage. Many scholars, following R. Bultmann, Theology of the New Testament, I, New York, 1951, pp. 222-23, have noted some degree of disjointedness in Paul's imagery. Misinterpreting the proper relationship between the polemical and exegetical factors of Paul's composition, they have failed to appreciate the rich blend of theological images found in II Cor., in, 3. Gf. also M. Carrez, Présence et fonctionnement de V ancien testament dans V annonce de V évangile, in RSR , LXIII, 1975, pp. 325-26 and Hickling, Sequence, pp. 381f. 37 The influence exerted by Prov., III, 3, 5, and 7 upon II Cor., iii, 3, 4, and 5, also upon II Cor., viii, 21 and Rom., xii, 16-17 (along with Prov., xvii, 13 and xxv, 21-22), would merit attention here, especially to illuminate the various transitions with in Paul's thought process. For a similar situation, see the discussion below of the relation between II Cor., hi, 4, 12 and Job, xi, 18 and xxviii, 8-10. 38 Appeal should be made to Paul's use of íxavóç in II Cor., n, 16 to account</page><page sequence="11">350 E. RICHARD thought leads him into the major theme of II Cor., iii, 4f., the ministry of the new covenant. The expression xaivîji; is taken from Jer., xxxviii, 31, 89 while Siaxóvouç, which situates the argument fully in the Corinthian situation (see especially xi, 23 and the subtle reference of hi, 3), 40 betrays no apparent OT source. If the latter term colors entirely the argument of hi, 7-iv, 6, it is the former which is the pivotal theme of Paul's text. Drawing from Ex., xxxiv and Ezek., xxxvi-xxxvn, he formulates his conception of the new covenant. It is no longer a covenant of Sinai (the letters on stone - Ex., xxxiv, 27-28: xà pÝjfxaxa, oí Xóyoi), which leads to death, but one of the life-giving Spirit {Ezek., xxxvii, 6: "I will put my Spirit within you; and you will live and will know that I am the Lord" - ftfjaeoöe xal yvcóaeatìe). V. 6b, then, is an expansion of the text of Jeremiah cited in 6a. Even Paul's anti- thetical style is suggested by his source, Jer., xxxviii: 31 ... 8ia0T)CTO[Aa(. tw otxc¡&gt; 'IaponjX xal x&lt;¡&gt; oïxco 'IouSa ôiadijxrjv xaivtjv 32 oů xaxà xijv SiaOvjxiqv. . . 6n aôxol oùx èvéfxeivav èv ty¡ Sia07¡xfl piou. . . 33 Sri a 8tk) •?) 8ta0Y¡xY¡. . . (cited at II Cor., m, 2). Instead of the oùx ... 6xi of his source, he returns to the oùx . . . áXXá of m, 3. Structurally, Paul approaches this part of his composition in a manner similar to vv. 1-3. Vv. 4-5 address themselves to Paul's personal and polemic situation, as does v. 1 above. The initial statement readily leads Paul to fundamentals: in the first case an expansion of Jer., xxxviii, 33 concerning a divine letter of recommendation and in the second case a commentary upon Jeremiah's (xxxviii, 31) concept of new covenant. As in the first instance where the key OT text is supplemented by other conside- both for the apologetic and theological development of this theme. Van Unnik, Conception paulinienne, p. 109, is correct in viewing the use of Ixavóç in iii, 5 as the answer to the question asked in 11, 16. The question was answered in v. 17 (Georgi, Gegner , p. 224) but only partially. •• J. Behm, TDNT , II, pp. 129-31; van Unnik, Conception paulinienne , p. 112; and HÉRING, Seconde épttre, p. 36. Cf. the interesting observations of Moule, 2 Cor . 3: 18b, pp. 232-33 and Hickling, Sequence , pp. 384-85, 389-95. 40 The theme of legitimacy of the ministry is very evident following v. 6; see for example vv. 7f., 13f ., 18; iv, 1-4, 5, 6. This is clearly an example of "adaptation to the present" of a biblical theme whereby the author's major concern (8iáxovoç/8iaxovía) influences his choice of OT texts and colors continually his interpretation of these; see Bloch, Midrash , col. 1266; Georgi, Gegner , pp. 31-33, 219-73; Dunn, 2 Corinthians , III, 17, pp. 310-11.</page><page sequence="12">A STUDY OF II COR., Ill, MV, 6 351 rations to formulate the nucleus of Paul's thought (v. 2), and subsequently to be developed in a midrashic way (v. 3), so now the basic idea taken from Jeremiah (new covenant) is comple- mented by themes from Exodus and Ezekiel to formulate Paul's renowned contrast between letter and spirit. Thus, the quotation consisting of elements a (new) and b (covenant - see v. 14 for old covenant) is developed as b : "not of the letter" and a: "but of the spirit" and still further by b : "for the letter kills" and a : "but the spirit gives life." V. 6 then is crucial in understanding both Paul's argument and train of thought. The phrase "new covenant" provokes an o òx/áXXá as well as a tò yáp/TÒ Sé clarification, namely, the old as opposed to the new in terms of letter/spirit and death/life. Both contrasts deserve particular attention since either they appear for the first time in the Pauline corpus (the former: Rom., ii, 27-29 and vii, 6) or for the first time in this particular context (the latter, regarding the resurrection: I Cor., xv, 21-22, also II Cor., v, 4, 15, and concerning the ministry: II Cor., n, 16 and iv, 10-12). For this reason we are led to seek in the OT passage employed a proximate source for Paul's insights. The "words' '/"sayings" of Ex., xxxiv, 27-28 and the "spirit" of Ezek., xxxvi, 26 would probably conjure in Paul's mind the fundamental difference between the old and the promised new covenant. At the same time, knowing that the Israelites turned away from the old covenant and were disregarded by God (àfxsXéco - Jer., xxxviii, 32) and knowing that the dis- enfranchized Israelites were as dry bones or dead men whom only the spirit could vivify (Ezek., xxxvii, 4-6, 9-11, 14), he concluded that the old convenant led to death and the new to life. 41 And so it was with the ministries of both. 41 In defense of a historical rather than an ontological explanation of the letter / spirit contrast in II Cor., hi, 6, the following observations should be made. (1) Scholars readily assume that Paul is in fact contrasting law and spirit or law and gospel (see Plummer, Second Epistle, p. 89; G. Schrenk, TDNT, I, pp. 765-69; W. Gutbrod, TDNT, IV, pp. 1069-78; Dunn, 2 Corinthians III, 17, pp. 310-11; D. W. Oostendorp, Another Jesus: A Gospel of Jewish-Christian Superiority in II Corinthians , Kampen, 1967, pp. 35-36; I. Hermann, Kyrios und Pneuma. Studien zur Christologie der pauli- nischen Hauptbrief, Munich, 1961, pp. 28f.; and especially Käsemann, Perspectives, pp. 149-55). This is true of Rom., ii, 27-28 and vii, 6; however, while the term vó(ioç appears frequently in Romans and Galatians and even a few times in I Corinthians, it never occurs in II Corinthians. Although it is methodologically sound in explaining an obscure text to seek enlightenment from other Pauline passages, it is nonetheless questionable that Paul's later, more mature statements should be read into this text (e.g., K. Prümm, Gal und 2 Kor ein lehr gehaltlicher Vergleich , in Riblica, XXXI, 1950, pp. 27-72 and Rom 1-11 und 2 Kor 3, in Riblica, XXXI, 1950, pp. 164-203). (2) On the one hand, one could argue for development in Paul's thought and</page><page sequence="13">352 E. RICHARD II COR., in, 7-11 Doubtless, a popular view, following Windisch, is to consider II Cor., hi, 7-18 a midrash on Ex., xxxiv, 28-35. However, careful analysis reveals that Paul employs this OT passage in vv. 7-11 and 13-18 to explicitate further the notion of new covenant, a theme received from early Christian tradition (I Cor., xi, 25) and brought to mind by the imagery of Jer., xxxviii, 31-34. Since it is character- istic of Jewish exegesis to employ scripture to interpret scripture, Paul appeals to the textus classicus concerning the Mosaic covenant and the glory of Moses' face to elucidate further Jeremiah's SiaO^XT) xaivyj. Several facts confirm this conclusion. (1) It is significant that the verse immediately preceeding the "shining face' ' motif should read as follows: "and he wrote these words on the tables of the covenant - the ten sayings" (Ex., xxxiv, 28). The underlined terms all have some bearing upon Paul's thought, not only in recapitulating earlier themes (table, word/letters, covenant, writing) but also in the formulation of vv. 7f. Further, it is particularly important that he is led to a text which refers explicitly to the covenant (another example of "tallying"). (2) One would expect that these two OT passages are readily associated one with the other in Jewish literature and therefore in theological and liturgical writings. 42 Not incidentally, the later Palestinian "Triannial Cycle" of synagogue readings combines Ex., xxxiv, 27-35 and Jer., xxxi (= LXX: xxxviii), 31-39 as seder and haflarah (tallying appropriate J. C. Hurd's statement concerning I Corinthians : "Here we meet a younger, more vigorous Paul, fired with enthusiasm in his new faith, less cautious in his theological statements than he later became..." ( The Origin of 1 Corinthians , New York, 1965, p. 287). On the other, it should be stressed that Paul's audience and/or opponents in Galaiians and Romans elicited from him a different set of arguments (K. Stendahl, Paul among Jews and Gentils , pp. 2-4, 48 and Hickling, Second Epistle , p. 287). The contrast Paul makes in II Cor., hi is that of old versus new covenant, Mosaic versus Christian (Pauline) ministries within the eschatological context of possible conversion now (vv. 14-17), much as Jeremiah or Ezekiel envisioned when speaking of a new covenant. This initial insight, already starkly stated as life/death, will occupy Paul's attention in a more radical and ontological way in later epistles and new contexts, no longer as covenant (rare in Romans and Galaiians) but as law and works (Moses) versus Spirit and faith (Abraham). (3) The theme of the vivifying Spirit has already appeared in Paul's earlier correspondence with the Corinthians (I Cor., xv). A similar concept, also related to Gen., ii, 7 and the Wisdom of Solomon, is to be found in Philo (see the work of K.-G. Sandelin, Die Auseinandersetzung mit in 1. Korinther 15, Abo, 1976, pp. 27-48). " See J. Behm, TDNT, III, p. 129 and van Unnik, Conception paulinienne, pp. 113- 18 for Jewish references to Jer., xxxviii, 31 f.</page><page sequence="14">A STUDY OF II COR., Ill, 1-IV, 6 353 element: cutting/establishing a covenant with Israel). 43 (3) More important are the rhetorical elements. Paul will return in later epistles to the theme of life/death, but in vv. 7-11 he wishes to cor- rect what might be taken as a totally negative evaluation of the old covenant (see also Rom., u, 27-in, 1 ; vu, 12-14). These verses serve as a corrective to in, 6b ; the old covenant, which leads to death, is of divine origin (glory), even though it is inferior to the new. 44 The situation is similar to that of hi, 2 where PauFs statement "you yourselves are our letter' ' could be misunderstood, thereby compell- ing him in v. 3 to clarify his thought: "you are a letter of Christ furnished by us." So in v. 7, in order to contrast the two covenants Paul reiterates several OT themes from vv. 1-6 (death, letter, stone, Spirit) and borrows from Ex., xxxiv the basic building blocks of his antithesis (eîSetv &gt; ocTsvfarai, Só^oc/SeSóÇacrrai, 46 tò Mcottaétúç/aÔTou, and oí uíol 'Icjpa^X). The major, and new, feature used to contrast the two, now seen as ministries, is that of glory, which term appears ten times in vv. 7-11. The antithetical structure of v. 6 prepares us for the long series of qalwahomer contrasts 46 developed in vv. 7-11: el Sé ... 7T&amp;Ç fxõXXov sí yap . . . 7toXX¿ú fxãXXov el yáp . . . 7uoXX¿p [xãXXov. 47 48 Mann, Bible as Read , pp. LVI-LVII, 530-33. The element to be emphasized is the continual tendency to correlate certain torah and prophetic passages rather than the ascription of a given association to a particular lectionary; see especially B. Z. Wacholder's 1971 Prolegomenon to Mann's work, pp. XI-L. 44 Paul's fundamental insight that the old dispensation is now terminated, not simply misunderstood (Dunn, 2 Corinthians III , 17, p. 311, n. 6), leads him to the conclusion, based on Ex., xxxiv, that the old was transitory. Just as Moses' shining face was ephemeral, so, according to the $6£oc imagery being used, was the old Siaxovia fading away. No extrabiblical sources for this idea are either available or necessary. 48 The temporal nuances given to this root, which appears only in the perfect passive in Ex., xxxiv, 29-35, are most instructive. While both covenants occurred in glory (v. 7), there exists a temporal distinction: aorist for the former, future for the latter (permanence is implied - see Plummer, Second Epistle, p. 90). In v. 11 the contrast is achieved by shifting from 8ià to èv for "that which is perma- nent." Lastly, where Paul concedes the continuation of glory to the old covenant (w. 9, 10 - perfect passive as in the LXX), he insists upon its inferiority to that of the new; cf. also G. Kittel, TDNT, II, p. 251. 48 On Paul's use of the hermeneutical technique qalwahomer or a minori ad maius, see Coppens, Arguments scripturaires, p. 247 and references given there; Bonsirven, Exégèse rabbinique, pp. 81-88, 317; and Bultmann, Der zweite Brief an die Korinther, Göttingen, 1976 (1951), p. 82. 47 See van Unnik, Conception paulinienne, p. 119, R.

RICHARD The content of these antitheses (drawn principally from the OT and Paul's earlier statements) and their pronounced rhetorical character (especially paronomasia) 48 underscore his desire to clarify each term of the phrase: "ministers of the new covenant" (v. 6). If the old dispensation, consisting of letters and carved on stone was one of glory (new citation of scripture for the minor), how much more the new, which is greater in all respects (concepts of the Christian dispensation for the major), II COR., in, 12-18 In v. 12, Paul, having clarified his statement regarding the two covenants, reverts again to his own situation, viz., his role as minister of the new covenant. Provoked by accusations of temerity (see II Cor., v, 1-10 where the same terms are employed) Paul, unlike the ungodly man of Job (xxvii, 8-10), possesses hope and confidence and acts with much boldness (7uoXXyj 7rapp&gt;)oi&lt;f). 49 To underscore the source of his boldness, a characteristic of the new covenant, Paul appeals once more, but in a negative way, to the example of Moses who by covering his face (a Semitic idiom) 60 was lacking fully in 7uappY)&lt;rfa. Paul, as minister of the new covenant, contrasts himself with Moses, minister of the old covenant 61 (note in vv. 14-15 the important links to Jer., xxxviii: writing/reading, new/old covenant, and heart). To achieve this contrast, Paul borrows directly from Ex., xxxiv, 33/35 to compose v. 13: Ex., xxxiv, 33 ... ¿7ué0Y)xev ¿7ul tò 7rpóaco7rov ocutou xáXofXfxa. 35 xai ÏSov oí oíol 'IapoeíjX tò 7rpóaco7tov Mcocnj 8ti SeSóÇa- (jtoci xai 7cepié07)xsv Mcoooijç xáXufxjxa irci tò 7upóaco- 7UOV éauTOÕ . . . 4# On the use of paronomasia in II Cor., iii, 1-11, confer Blass-Debrunner- Funk, Greek Grammar of the New Testament, p. 488.

In effect, the two parts of v. 13, a (veil on face = quotation) and b (lack of vision + citation of II Cor., iii, 7), prepare for the dual statement of v. 14, b (lack of understanding) and a ("the same veil"). Furthermore, one should also note the important time shift from the aorist of both OT verses (simple action) to the imperfect in II Cor., in, 13 (repeated or habitual action). Vv. 13b-15 state in no uncertain terms the cessation of the old covenant 52 and, with the same veil imagery borrowed from Ex., xxxiv, explain why the children of Israel then and now 68 fail to understand that in Christ the new covenant has arrived. Paul, however, does not end his treatment of Israel thus. Instead, he borrows once again from Exodus (xxxiv, 34) a text which allows him to discuss Israel's hope for salvation. The correlation between Paul's text and his source is as follows: II Cor., in, 16 Ex., xxxiv, 34 Yjvíxa 8k èàv rjvíxa 8' âv èmarpé^T) elcre7cope¿eTO Maxrîjç 7UpÒÇ xiSpiov Žvavri xupíou XaXeiv aÛTcj) 7uepiaipetTai 7repiļf)peiTO tò xáXufXfza. tò xáXufjijxa.

RICHARD reaching differences between the two texts are owing to inten- tional transformation 56 by Paul to apply the OT text to his audience. 54 (1) The time element of the original is different: the imperfect indicative of the LXX gives way to the subjunctive after ^vixa to indicate future time 67 and the imperfect changes to the present. These modifications agree with the emphasis placed upon temporal elements in vv. 14 ("until this very day") and 15 ("even to this day"). (2) LXX d&lt;mops6oļioci is replaced by a synonym, 58 which also has the technical meaning of "conversion" (è7t«rrpéç(ù). 69 (3) The Ivavrt xupiou of the OT becomes 7rpòç xúpiov an ambiguous expression which could refer to God, who is the source of all conversion (see n. 59 above) or to Christ, who removes the veil (see v. 14). 40 (4) The elimination of Moses' name from III , 18, in BB, LVI, 1949, p. 408; B.

" Liddel-Scott-Jones, Greek-English Lexicon, p. 775; Dunn, 2 Corinthians III, 17, p. 317. •• Two proposals have been made to account for this modification. Plummer, Second Epistle, p. 102, appeals to the occurrence of è7ttaTpé&lt;pcú npóą in Ex., xxxiv, 31 as the proper explanation (also Schneider, Dominus autem Spiritus est, pp. 77-78). Le Déaut, Traditions targumiques, p. 44, rightly objects: "Mais cela n'explique toujours pas l'interprétation de ce verbe au sens moral de 'retour à Dieu'." He then proposes his own solution, viz., the use by Paul of a "glose aggadique" found in Tg. Ps.-J. Ex., xxxiii, 7b: "anyone who (re)turn (dhdr) in repentance ( bltwb *) with a true heart to the Lord (qdm yhwh)..." Such a text provides interesting, though late, Jewish back- ground for Paul's statement (as does the addition in the same targum at Ex., xxxiv, 7b "of those returning to the scriptures" - slh Itgybgn ; see II Cor., hi, 15), but it does not explain the fundamental change imposed upon the OT verse. From a strictly linguistic stand point, appeal to the LXX suffices (the structural relationship between Paul's text and its source as well as the frequent occurrence in the LXX of the idiom èmoTpéço rcpoę xúpiov - e.g., Ex., v, 22; xxxii, 31; I Sam., vii, 3; etc.; the last mentioned meaning "conversion"). •• Paul never employs elcnropeiSopai in his letters, but makes use of èmoTpéçcd in J Thess., i, 9; II Cor., iii, 16; and Gal., iv, 9. In the first two, the subject turns to (írpóç) God or the Lord (i.e., conversion), while in the last, it turns to (etę) things that enslave. Paul, then, is clearly playing on words and does not shy away from changing his source (see note 56 above) to make an important point to his Corinthian community; see also Feuillet, Le Christ, pp. 129-30. #0 The term Švocvri is used only by Luke in the NT. At the same time, in the Pauline letters rcpóę is generally used with 0eóç (ten times) and rarely with xúpioç II Cor., m, 16; v, 8; and Phm ., 5. In Phm., 5, Paul clearly refers to Jesus. II Cor., V, 8 reads rcpôç tòv xúptov and also refers to Christ; but as a parallel to árcò tou xopfou in v. 6, it requires the meaning "with the Lord." Since only II Cor., hi, 16 is anarthous, its meaning is more difficult to determine. If Paul is being faithful to the OT passage (implied by context: citation and God as source of conversion), the term would seem to refer to the xiSpioç of the LXX text (Thrall, First and Second Letters, pp. 137-38; Collange, Énigmes, pp. 103-4; Feuillet, Le Christ, p. 129, but also functionally</page><page sequence="18">A STUDY OF II COR., Ill, MV, 6 357 the protasis clearly indicates a change in the subject of the follow- ing verb. With Barrett, therefore, we may conclude that rapŁaipetTai is middle and not passive and that the change is both one of time (imperfect to present) and one of subject for both verbs. 61 The meaning of the OT passage in the hands of Paul qualifies as derash exegesis, i.e., reading into the OT text more than the author intended. Its approximate meaning is as follows: "but whenever it (heart?) 62 turns (as did Moses) to the Lord, he removes the veil." Finally, it should be no.ted that Paul, recapitulating what he has already stated in v. 14 ("very day" and "the reading"), structures v. 15 on the pattern of v. 16, so that the latter becomes the focal point of the discussion. Vv. 17-18 develop further Paul's earlier statement that the new covenant is one of the Spirit. Note the hermeneutical technique employed in 17a: "now 'the Lord' [referred to above, i.e., v. 16] is the Spirit." 63 Despite the heated debate surrounding v. 17a, 64 we can conclude that Paul is developing a trinitarian theme, not on an ontological but on a soteriological and functional level. Basic to his old/new contrast is the theological background of Moses and the children of Israel as well as the Christological dimension of the new covenant. This is clear up to v. 14. Vv. 15-16 pursue this same theme, and, in light of the modifications imposed upon the OT text, allow Paul to clarify an important point for his Corinthian commu- nity, viz., the role of the Spirit. The turning to God is achieved through Christ and remains the work of the Spirit. 65 Paul's exegetical techniques allow him to place a theological text (the to the Spirit, p. 133). One could appeal, as does Collange, to L. Cerfaux's ( Recueil L . Cerfaux , Gembloux, 1954, pp. 173-88 =ETL, XX, 1943, pp. 5-17) research on the meaning of "Lord" in Pauline citations as confirming this option. However, Cerfaux does not list this occurrence in his conclusions. It appears then that the ambiguity of the passage is intentional and that Paul retains the LXX term, sets it in the pattern he usually reserves for God, but astutely through context (the Jews in II Cor., in are true non-Christian followers of Moses, so conversion to Christ is implied) and through structure (as a parallel of èv Xpi&lt;raì&gt; of v. 14) applies the passage to Christ (Héring, Seconde épttre , pp. 38-39 and Barrett, Second Epistle, p. 122). #1 Second Epistle , p. 122; contra Schneider, Dominus autem Spiritus est, pp. 76, 79: Collange.

RICHARD xóptoç of the citation meaning God) within a Christological context (the new covenant) and by means of a hermeneutical note to transform further, on a functional level, the sense of "Lord' ' to mean "Spirit" 66 (the unexpressed subject of èxiorpé^ in v. 16 is probably also multidimensional). To understand Paul's thought here one must follow the exegetical process of II Cor., iii, 1-18 rather than treat isolated phrases as theological dicta. It seems clear then that II Cor., hi, 4-18 offers a mixture of peshal and derash exegesis whereby the new covenant concept of Jeremiah is explained in terms of Ex., xxxiv, 28-35 and, to a certain extent, Ezek., xxxvi-xxxvn. Vv. 4-18 are an explication of Jer., xxxviii, 31, 33, wherein the theological and Christological dimensions of the new covenant are attributed to the "ministry of the Spirit." 67 The structure of ch. iii, therefore, is clearly delineated: 1-3 1 situation "we commend ourselves' ' 2 quatation (Jer. ; context: letter) "written on our hearts" ■«- 3 commentary (+ other citations) "not on... but on..." •*- 4-6 4 situation "so we have such confidence" 6a quotation (Jer. ; context: ministry) 6b commentary ( -f- other citations) "letter... spirit" &lt;-i "letter... spirit" -&lt;-1 7-11 Parenthetical clarification of v. 6 7 commentary (further quotation: Exod) "in glory... fading" -«-i 11 "fading... in glory" -&lt;-l •• To a certain extent, we can agree with Feuilleťs analysis of II Cor., in, 17 [Le Christ, pp. 126-35), when he proposes that xéptoç of vv. 16 and 17 refers both to God and to the Spirit, and that there is an "équivalence d'ordre avant tout fonctionnel entre Yahvé et son Esprit" (p. 133). However, Feuillet does not pay sufficient attention to a third element in his analysis, i.e., the role of Christ. The phrase èv Xpicmp xarap- Ycïtoci of v. 14 requires some explanation in relation to w. 15-18 and to a great extent justifies the conclusion that xiSpioç of v. 16 also refers to Christ. Further, Feuilleťs basic solution for w. 16-17, while attractive, is too conjectural to be convin- cing. To defend his conclusion that the Spirit is the common principle of both covenants he appeals to OT passages where the Spirit is related to the old covenant. While this may be true of the OT, it is not Paul's idea anywhere in II Cor., m, where the Spirit is always related to the new covenant. 97 On the hermeneutical role of the Spirit, see Käsemann, Perspectives, p. 155 and Coppens, Arguments scripturaires, p. 248.</page><page sequence="20">A STUDY OF II COR., Ill, 1-IV, 6 359 12-18 12 situation "having such hope, we" 13 commentary (quotation repeated) "veil over his face" &lt;- 15-16 added development 18 "with unveiled face" &lt;- Each major section, except the parenthetical clarification of vv. 7-11, begins with Paul's situation and presents an inclusio.

II COR ., iv, 1-6 m, 18 terminates a long discourse on the new covenant by sounding the theological depths of Paul's thought, 69 just as in, 3 had by its very breadth forestalled further development (see also vv. 6 and 11). In iv, 1, Paul has recourse to his own situation: "therefore having this service... we." Vv. 1-5 develop at length the themes of ch. in in relation to the Corinthian ministry (see below for further elaboration). Of immediate concern is the citation of iv, 6: ó 0sòç ó eináv ' èx ctxótouç &lt;pćoę Xápi(/ei. While most scholars hesitantly have pointed to Gen., i, 3 as the source, rarely do they attempt to explain the obvious differences between the alleged source and Paul's text. 70 J. Jerwell goes one step further and maintains that II Cor., in, 18- IV, 6 is a midrash on Gen., i. In this way he seeks to explain the use of ebccov in II Cor., m, 18 and iv, 4 along with the theme of creation. 71 Feuillet and Barrett are nearer to the mark by maintain- ing, in Barrett's words: "more probably the word image was 88 Barrett, Second Epistle, p. 125. 88 Analysis of II Cor., in, 18 does not fit into the perspective of the present study, but it is important to stress the influence of speculative wisdom on this passage (see further n. 72 below) and of Jewish mysticism upon Paul's thought, e.g., II Cor., xii, 1-10 and Rom., viii, 18-25 (confer H. G. Kee, Satan, Magic, and Salvation in the Testament of Job, in SBL Seminar Papers, I, Missoula, 1974, p. 69). 70 The list includes "la quasi-totalité des commentaires" (Collange, Énigmes, p. 138), who wish to see in II Cor., hi, 18 and jv, 4-6 some relation between the theme of creation ( Gen., i, 26-27) and Paul's ministry as a new creation. 71 Imago Dei, Gn. 1, 26f im Spätjudentum, in der Gnosis und in den paulinischen Briefen, Göttingen, 1960, pp. 173-76, 194-97, 209-18; see also R.

RICHARD suggested by the reference to the looking-glass, in the context of wisdom speculation, see especially Wisdom vii.26." 72 Instead, in agreement with Collange, it is preferable to see here a quotation drawn from Is., ix, 1 (6 Aocòç 6 7îopsu6(xsvoç iv axórei, ÏSsts &lt;põç ¡jiya • oí xaroixouvreç èv crxiã Oavávou, &lt;pã&gt;ç Aá/iipei è&lt;p' 73 and to appeal to Isaiah's Ebed Yahweh theme ("light of the nations") as the link in Paul's argument that he preaches Jesus as Lord and himself as servant. 74 However, stylistic analysis allows greater precision. In iv, 1-2 Paul dwells once more in very apologetic terms on the theme of commendation, but in v. 2b he is led to the more universal aspect of the ministry, "making known the truth" by appealing "to the consciences of all men before God." Vv. 3-5 then address themselves in more general terms to the problem of unbelievers for whom the gospel is veiled 73 and to the role of the minister. Unbelievers are blinded and so unable to benefit from the light (&lt;poma¡j.ó?) of the gospel. 74 This is the point which leads him to Isaiah. In v. 6 he quotes Is., ix, 1 and composes upon it a marvelous statement of his ministry: (a) ó 8eòç ó eíra&amp;v (b) èx oxótouç (c) &lt;p£&gt;ç (d) (d') 8ç ŽAajitpev - èv ratę xapSíaiç 78 Feuillet, Le Christ , pp. 150-58 and Barrett, Second Epistle , pp. 125 (quota- tion), 132-35.

Further, the combination in II Cor., n, 14-16 of ôojjly), yvûaiç, 9avepóco, and eòcirôíoc may well be related to Ezek., xx, 41-42: èv èafAfl eûcoSiaç . . . xoct' òçOaXpoúç . . . ¿7uyvcí&gt;aea0e Sióti ¿y¿&gt; xúpioç (see also Oostendorp, Another Jesus, p. 32). Paul's use of "gospel" and "knowledge" as synonyms in II Cor., iv, 4 and 6 rather confirms our suspicion that he is drawing from the OT the concept of yvcõatç in II Corinthians generally. This term, contrary to the usage in I Corinthians, is employed in a wholly positive sense (see Barrett, Second Epistle, pp. 98-99) and is related to the apostolic mission. The OT passages cited in ch. m have as major concern the covenant whereby knowledge of God is received (see hi, 18 where vision of God's glory is realized in the new covenant). In the polemical context of II Corin- thians (ii, 14; iv, 6) yvôoLç becomes a key term in defending the apostolic mission (on the broader scope of the problem of epistemology at Corinth, cf. J. L.

RICHARD passage, and the inspiration Paul draws from the OT call for observations in three areas: composition, unity of the passage, and, finally, polemics and Paul's opponents. (1) It has been a major objective of this paper to investigate Paul's method of composition and exegesis. Joseph Klausner aptly described Paul, as "... an expert in combining the Haggadic and Midrashic methods of the Sages of Israel with... Hellenistic methods of thought."79 Using the hermeneutical techniques of his day, Paul habitually employs the OT in his writings to express his theology, particularly when dealing with or opposing fellow Jews. 80 II Cor., in, 1-3 is best seen as an expansion of Jer., xxxviii, 33. The Corinthian community is a letter of Christ written on Paul's heart. Employing letter-of-recommendation imagery, Paul sees himself as bearing (or the instrument by which it is produced) this divine recommendation in his own heart where it is visible to all. Not one to miss an occasion to deal with fundamentals, he proceeds in v. 3 to describe the nature of the Christian community - it is a letter of the Spirit written on the heart not on stone, antithesis of the ideal of his Jewish antagonists. 81. II Cor., iii, 4-18 should be viewed as a commentary on the phrase taken from Jer., xxxviii, 31, "new covenant." In vv. 4-6 Paul invokes his own situation (competence) and is led, in con- trasting the old covenant with the new (use of Ezekiel and Exodus), to overstate his case. Therefore, in vv. 7-11, drawing upon Ex., 79 Jesus of Nazareth : His Life , Times , and Teaching , Boston, 1964 (1922), p. 63. At a further remove from turn-of-the-century scholarship, it is unnecessary to draw such a sharp distinction between Judaism and Hellenism; see M. Hengel, Judaism and Hellenism: Studies in Their Encounter in Palestine during the Early Hellenistic Period , Philadelphia, 1974 and Sanders, Paul and Palestinian Judaism . 80 This must not imply that Paul limits his use of the OT to polemics or Jewish audiences. On the contrary his theology is intimately related to and based upon the the Jewish scriptures; on this point see Lind ars. Place of the Old Testament, p. 60. 81 The debate over the identity and character of Paul's opposition in II Corinthians continues; see among others, E. Käsemann, Die Legitimität des Apostels , in ZNTW , XLI, 1942, pp. 41-48; W. Schmithals, Gnosticism in Corinth : An Investigation of the Letters to the Corinthiansf Nashville, 1971 (1956); J.

This ministry he investigates in terms of glory. The new covenant is superior in every way to the old, but the old did possess divine glory. In a third section (vv. 12-18), alluding again to accusations leveled against him, Paul discusses a characteristic which ministers of the new covenant must possess, viz., boldness of speech (7uappY)&lt;r£a - v. 12) and freedom (iXeuOepia - v. 17). Within this inclusio, Paul, drawing once more upon Ex ., xxxiv, discourses upon the old covenant and the veil which protects its ignorance. V. 18 then speaks of the unveiled aspect (boldness) of the new covenant and by its mention of the Spirit, underscores the dynamism of the entire chapter, as well as the structural and thematic unity of vv. 6-18. II Cor ., iv, 1-6 forms a fitting conclusion to ch. in. Paul resumes once more the theme of Siocxovta (hi, 6f.) to address himself more directly to his ministry in Corinth. Within these verses, at every turn, he alludes to points discussed in ch. in: in relation to the veil of Moses (in, 12-18), he speaks in ch. iv of "renouncing hidden things of shame/ ' "the veiling of the good news," "blinding of thoughts/ ' "enlightenment/ ' "light," and "knowledge / ' in relation to ministry, glory, and competence (iii, 4-11), he alludes in ch. iv to "mercy received," "duty performed," "not walking in trickery," "not falsifying the word of God," "good news of the glory of Christ," himsel "as servant through Jesus," and "knowledge of the glory of God;" and finally in regard to credentials (hi, 1-3), Paul again in ch. iv, "by making known the truth commends himself to the consciences of all men before God." Vv. 5-6 of ch. iv reiterate the three major themes of ch. in. a) In commending himself Paul is careful to point out that Christ Jesus as Lord is the object of his proclamation (Paul is the servant). b ) The ministry of the new covenant has as its goal to reveal the knowledge of the glory of God (8ó£a). c) This glory is to be found in the face (7upó&lt;Kú7uov) of Christ. In iv, 6 Paul, drawing upon Is., ix, 1, sums up his own conception of the ministry in a final exegetical statement. Polemics and immediate historical context recede before Paul's conception of the content and nature of the gospel. (2) The unity of II Cor., in, 1-iv, 6 is assured on three levels.</page><page sequence="25">364 E. RICHARD In the first instance, Paul is embroiled in controversy with the "profiteers" who have infiltrated the Corinthian community. At every juncture he is ready and able to defend his ministry and, in this sense, this passage is an apology. In II Cor., 11, 14-17 he prepares his audience for the main thrust of his defense: salvation/ destruction, death/life, competence, true Christian ministry (xavévavTi 0eo3 lv Xpicrrtp). At each major break Paul inserts an important element of the controversy: iii, 1 : letters of recommen- dation; 4f.: competence as minister; 12: boldness in action; and at iv, If.: summary of his defense. The concept of ministry over- shadows the entire discussion. Paul's choice and interpretation of texts are constantly influenced by his preoccupation with the role of the ministry in the new dispensation. 88 Not one, however, to dwell very long upon surface matters, Paul investigates the theological significance of each theme. This element, in fact, brings us to the second aspect of unity, namely, Paul's use of the OT, initially to defend his own ministry but ultimately to describe the ministry of the Spirit. Led to the important text of Jer., xxxviii, 31-33 by the issue over letters of recommendation, Paul seizes upon Jeremiah's concept of the new covenant and proceeds to draw from the sacred text the very fabric of his theo- logical vision. Thirdly, Paul carries his argument regarding the ministry well beyond the immediate controversy of Corinth and thereby provides further unity to his text. He insists that while he is the minister (ii, 14: St' -iļļjiSv) it is as servant (m, 3, 6 ; iv, 5 - Stáxovoç/SouXoç) that he ministers. At stake at Corinth is the Pauline mission and its legitimacy 88 (see especially iv, 6), namely, the nature and content of the gospel. (3) While it is not possible here to discourse upon the problem of Paul's opponents nor even to discuss the peculiar aspects of his opposition in II Corinthians, it is nonetheless feasible to note a few 88 Paul chooses and reinterpretes older biblical concepts according to his own theological ideas and apologetic concerns (see Bloch, Midrash , col. 1271; J. D. G. Dunn, Unity and Diversity in the New Testament : An Inquiry into the Character of Earliest Christianity y Philadelphia, 1977, pp. 74-75), even to the extent of making Moses (II Cor., iii, 12-18) a precursor of his Corinthian rivals and the antithesis of the true Christian minister; see Coppens, Arguments scripturaires , p. 249; and Carrez, Présence et fonctionnement , p. 330; contra Georgi, Gegner , pp. 258f. and M.

Analyses of Paul's opponents in II Corinthians often lay great stress upon the extensive use made of Ex., xxxiv in II Cor., m.84 Whether the exposition there is called a pre-Pauline or Pauline midrash, or whether it is seen as a polemical thrust against Judaizing or simply Jewish opponents, the passage is assumed to be a defense against personal attack emanating from Corinth. In reality, these scholars presume what they wish to prove. 86 If the above analysis is correct, viz., that II Cor., hi, 6f., drawing its inspiration from the OT, is a complex theological statement of Paul's concept of the new covenant, then it is necessary to reevaluate the polemical elements in relation to the structure of the chapter. A distinct feature of Paul's composition which has emerged in this study is the polemical nature of transitional components. Each new section begins on a personal note and immediately leads Paul to polemical considerations. Renewed commendation brings forth the problem of letters of recommen- dation ; confidence allows him to defend his competence as minister of the new covenant ; and hope permits him to answer the charge that he lacks boldness, or preaches a veiled gospel. The polemical elements, therefore, are clearly delineated and are further empha- sized by their relation to n, 14-17 and iv, 1-6. The former announces the major concerns of ch. in, while the latter spells out in great detail the charges and counter-charges of the Corinthian contro- versy. It is particularly the issue of competence, raised in u, 16, either as a rhetorical question denying the opponents' overconfident claims or answering an accusation against him, which leads Paul into an extended use of Ex., xxxiv in subsequent verses. The counter- accusations of ii, 17 prompt concrete treatment of the charge that Paul lacks letters of recommendation. This theme, as seen earlier, brings to mind the new covenant motif taken from Jeremiah, and furnishes Paul the material for his defense.

RICHARD takes great pains to clarify the notion of competence and conclude that God has in fact made him competent, but as minister of the new covenant. While the motif of old/new covenant is central to the whole of the ensuing discussion, the added element of minister colors the entire development which follows. 86 II Cor., iii, 7-11, a discourse on the glory of the two covenants, views these precisely as ministries. In v. 12, again invoking his own situation, Paul counters the charge that he is timid or deceitful by insisting, instead, that he acts boldly. He seizes upon a text quoted earlier (v. 7). and employs it to defend himself against the accusation that he preaches a hidden or veiled gospel. Playing on the expression "with veiled face" he contrasts Moses and himself as ministers. In iv, If. he discusses again the ministry which he has received through God's mercy, develops at length the accusation leveled against him, and formulates a few of his own against his opponents. The themes of competence and ministry, already of concern in I Corinthians (iii, 5; xii, 5; xv, 9), become the rallying point of Paul's defense as he combines these in an attempt to answer the charges being made against him in Corinth. The situation within the community as seen in chs x-xm is considerably different and so is Paul's stone 87 as well as the basis of his defense. Competence gives way to weakness and to authority according to the standard of God's measure (x, 8, 12-18). 88 Paul abandons the competence terminology of his earlier defense 88 and dwells upon his role as instrument; the weaker the instrument the stronger the power of God - the only true measure of the Christian apostolate (II Cor., xii, 9-10). 80 The terminology, then, of II Cor., ii, 14- 88 See Georgi, Gegner , pp. 219-73, on the centrality of this concept in evaluating the Corinthian situation; however, the further claim which he makes concerning the opponents as "divine men" missionaries (pp. 220f.) is rightly rejected on linguistic (J. N. Collins, GeorgVs ł Envoys * in 2 Cor 11:23, in JBL , XCIII, 1974, pp. 88-96), methodological (Hickling, Second Epistle, pp. 284-87), and more general grounds (Barrett, PauVs Opponents, 233-54). The same applies to Rissi, Studien, pp. 13-41; Schütz, Paul, pp. 165-86; and, in certain particulars, Collange, Énigmes, pp. 18-20 (authors cited there). 87 Barrett, Second Epistle, contra Schütz, Paul, p. 166, n. 1 (but see a&amp;o p. 167, n. 1) and H.

New Orleans, La U.S.A. Earl Richard. 91 Also Hickling, Sequence , p. 395: "It is not here that we must look for a mirror in which to descry the faces of his adversaries." This statement, perhaps, is extreme, since II Corinthians does provide many insights regarding Paul's opponents, but it does alert us to the temptation of making Paul far less creative and Jewish than he in fact was.</page></plain_text>
