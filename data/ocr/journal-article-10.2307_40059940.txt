<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PEARL-FOET AND THE PELAGIANS Lawrence Beaston Given his keen interest in theology, especially the topic of grace, and given the long discussion in Pearl about heavenly rewards, it is no surprise that modern students of the Pearl-poet should attempt to situate him in contemporary theological discussion about God's role in human salvation. This issue came to a focus for the Oxford scholar and future archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Bradwardine (d. 1349), one of the principal partici- pants in this discussion, when he realized, as he subsequently related in his De causa Dei, that he "rarely used to hear about grace, except in an ambiguous way But the whole day [he] would hear that we are masters of our own free acts and that it is in our own power to do good or evil, to have virtues or sins, and many things like that" (Book I, Ch. 35, 308D).1 He concluded that, like the fifth-century monk Pelagius, many of his (and the Pearl-poet's) contemporaries minimized God's role in human salvation. Bradwardine did not mention specific names, though Gordon Leff asserts that Bradwardine was addressing William of Ockham (d. 1 347) and his followers (13). Indeed, some Ockhamists, like Thomas Buckingham (d. 1351), seemed to question the necessity of grace and to over-emphasize the resemblance of human to divine free will (Leff 11; Oberman 142; Dolnikowski 220).2 Furthermore, the stress on the importance of human efforts by such men as Robert Holcot (c. 1 300- 1 349) mirrored the Pelagian belief that adhering to moral law is the way to salvation (Dolnikowski 228; Wilken 226). Denounced by Augustine, Pelagianism had been unequivo- cally deemed heretical by the church. The Council of Orange (A.D. 529) R&amp;L 36.1 (Spring 2004) 15</page><page sequence="2">1 6 Religion &amp; Literature affirmed that, because of original sin, human beings are incapable of doing any good work on their own. The first step in human salvation, according to the council, is not dependent upon human will and human actions but upon God. The synod declared that "undeserved grace pre- cedes meritorious works" (Parsons 710). Modern scholars place the Pearl-pott on both sides of this issue. Most, like Carleton Brown, see him as partial to the Augustinian view that one's salvation depends upon God's grace rather than human efforts (Brown 130; Tristman 284; Brewer 4). In a 1970 essay, Richard Tristman, how- ever, finds the /WZ-maiden's notion that infants are justified "by ryght" (684) inconsistent with the belief in the necessity of grace. He points to the /feflrZ-maiden's statement in lines 626-27 that "As sone as [the innocent] arn borne, by lyne / In the water of babtem thay dyssente" [As soon as [the innocent] are born, in due course, into the baptismal water they descend].3 The maiden, says Tristman, suggests that newly born infants come to baptism of their own will rather than by the grace of God. Tristman, who assumes that the maiden speaks for the poet, takes this passage as evidence that the poet favors the Pelagian position (285). Philip O'Mara's study of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight also links the Pearl-poet's views to those of the so-called Pelagiani moderni of the fourteenth century. In an essay tracing Holcot's influence on the poet, O'Mara argues that Bertilak, a central character in Sir Gawain, is portrayed as a pagan justified by his natural goodness, not God's grace ("Robert" 332). As evidence that a fourteenth-century Christian like the Pearl-poet could entertain the idea of a pagan being saved, O'Mara cites the theological speculations of scholars like Holcot, Adam of Wodeham (d. 1358), and Uthred of Boldon (d. 1396) ("Robert" 333). O'Mara also points to numerous literary works, such as Piers Plowman and St. Erkenwald, which, he says, explore the issue ("Robert" 338). Moreover, there are, according to O'Mara, several images in Holcot's Moralitates, like the personified love of neighbor who is clad in green, that have obvious parallels to figures in Sir Gawain ("Holcot" 98). O'Mara speculates that Holcot may have actually known the author of Sir Gawain, and that, like both Holcot and Bradwardine, the poet may have once been part of the household of Richard de Bury, bishop of Durham ("Holcot" 103). Despite what Tristman says, the Pearl-maiden is usually regarded as the voice of orthodoxy. Lines 626-27, in which Tristman locates the maiden's Pelagianism, must be seen in context. Line 625 reads, "Bot innoghe of grace has innocent." Indeed, the last line in every stanza of section XI of the poem is "For the grace of God is gret inoghe" or some variation</page><page sequence="3">LAWRENCE BEASTON 1 7 thereof (612). The infants she refers to do not move to the baptismal waters entirely on their own; grace, prevenient grace, prompts them to seek the baptism by which they are cleansed of original sin (653-56) and enables them to become God's elect. It is true that the maiden claims that the innocent are saved "by ryght," but she is not suggesting that they have earned salvation by their own efforts. Unlike those who come to salvation by repenting of sin and receiving mercy, the innocent, having been baptised, die sinless, not through sheer force of their own will or any natural ability but because they die before they have the ability to make choices. There is nothing Pelagian in the maiden's words; she denies neither original sin nor the need for grace. Indeed, the maiden repeatedly emphasizes God's role in human salvation. She exhorts the narrator to "sech hys [God's] blythe ful swefte and swythe" [seek God's mercy swiftly and earnestly] (354). That mercy, she says, will work its power in him to assuage his grief. She concludes by saying, "Al lys in hym [God] to dyght and deme" [all lies with him to ordain and judge] (360). According to her, the first step in salvation is taken not by the sinner but by an agent of the Divine when she tells the narrator that Mary is the "Blessed bygynner of uch a grace!" (436). She later points out, moreover, that Christ provided a remedy for the narrator's sinfulness when He suffered in the earthly Jerusalem "for manes sake" (940). Consistent with the Augustinian view of salvation, then, the maiden believes that God has provided grace sufficient for the narrator to be saved. But since she repeatedly chastises him and urges him to change his attitude and actions, she clearly believes that the narrator must assume some responsibility for his redemption. The narrator, on the other hand, has come to be associated with the so- called Pelagian point of view. David Aers points, for example, to the narrator's interpretation of the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard. While the maiden tells the parable to illustrate her claim that the innocent are equal, in heaven's eyes, to those Christians who live long lives in obedience to God, the narrator shares the dissatisfaction of the workers who spend the whole day in the vineyard yet receive the same wages as those who worked only a short time (549). He asserts what Aers calls "God's obligation to reward labor (590-600), a breathtakingly confident Pelagianism" (71). Jim Rhodes agrees with Aers that the narrator articu- lates the position of the Pelagians. When, for example, the narrator quotes Psalm 61 (62 in the Authorized Version) - "Thou quytes uchon as hys desserte" [You reward each one according to his desert] (595) - he is emphasizing human efforts, not those of God (Rhodes 139). The maiden, says Rhodes, asserts the opposite view (121-22). Rejecting the notion that</page><page sequence="4">1 8 Religion &amp; Literature the narrator is simply naive and inept in spiritual matters, Rhodes argues that the maiden should not be seen as the Lady Philosophy to the narrator's Boethius. Rather the narrator "shares the theological and moral center of the poem with her" (120). The Pearl-poet himself, according to Rhodes, gives credibility to both sides of the issue, preferring "to sustain the paradox built into the parable [ . . . ]so that the impasse between the parties serves as a provocation that both frustrates closure and allows questions of social justice and divine justice to arise naturally from the situation he depicts" (138).4 In this essay, I want to reexamine what Pearl tells us about the poet's position on this theological issue from an angle not explored heretofore. Instead of pointing to the doctrinal statements of the characters or tracing possible historical influences on the poet, I will look closely at the way the poet portrays God for clues to the poet's leanings. Such an examination will show that the poet presents God in two logically incongruent ways. On the one hand, separated from the narrator by a river, He is seen as both distant from the world of human beings and not directly involved in human affairs, a view consistent with the God implied by Pelagianism. But, on the other hand, the Pearl-poet sketches God as a "frende ful fyin" [very fine friend] (1204) who takes an active interest in the life of the narrator, a divinity more consistent with the Augustinian tradition. This line of thought is suggested by Lawrence Clopper's perceptive study "The God of the Gawain-Poet," which examines the extent to which the poet anthropomorphizes the Deity in the poems of the Gawain-manuscript. In his discussion of Pearl, Clopper recognizes that the geography of the dream implies the Pelagian notion of the relationship between the God and His creation ("God" 14). Clopper, however, does not consider the other aspect of the God of Pearl, the narrator's "frende ful fyin." I want to consider here the implications of the juxtaposition of these two portraits of God. The God of the Pelagians The One seated on the throne of the New Jerusalem in the Pearl- narrator's dream does, in fact, resemble the distant God implied by the Pelagiani moderni The way God came to be conceived by these scholars stems from efforts to resolve certain theological contradictions. The ortho- dox plan of salvation, to which the maiden apparently subscribes, is problematic, of course, because it is difficult to square the sovereignty of God with the belief in human free will. If, as a result of original sin, human</page><page sequence="5">LAWRENCE BEASTON 19 beings are incapable of any good work without the aid of God's grace, then only those who have the benefit of God's grace can hope to achieve salvation. Since God decides who receives grace, then He ultimately decides who is saved. Little is left to human choice. One way to preserve human free will might be to assert that God makes grace available to all human beings. Then, the person who rejects grace and thereby rejects salvation, must assume responsibility for his or her own damnation. Eleanor Stump says that Augustine toyed with this idea but did not pursue it. If human beings can do no good except with God's grace, then, as Stump says, one cannot even accept grace without God's help (138). Moreover, if grace were available to all, then it becomes, in effect, a natural endowment of human beings, and God's involvement in human salvation is mini- mized. Stump says that Augustine made numerous attempts to solve "the problem of making God the sole source of all goodness in the post-Fall human will without taking away from human beings control over their wills." In the end, she says, Augustine recognized that he could not succeed (139). By the late Middle Ages, theologians were advocating theoretical positions that de-emphasized God's active role in creation. Laurence Eldredge says that the common denominator of the 219 propositions taught at the University of Paris and condemned in 1277 by the bishop of that city was that they posited a limitation to God's power (212). Though Eldredge says that the notion of God's absolute power may not have been a direct response to the condemnation of these 219 propositions, its prominence was certainly evident in theological discussion which followed (213). The idea of a God who possesses absolute power suggests a being who is beyond the grasp of human intellect. In fact, theologians in the fourteenth century, including both Bradwardine and Ockham, agreed that God cannot be fully apprehended by human thought (Dolnikowski 186, 2 1 7, 230; Wood 356). Though Dolnikowski, unlike Leff, argues that Ockham did not see God as incomprehensible, he did maintain that human logic can explain God's absolute power only in part (219; Courtenay 96). Even so, as Clopper points out, God in his potentia absolute is other ("God" 2). The Pearl-poet is probably reflecting this trend in contemporary thought when he relies on a number of poetic devices to emphasize God's other- ness. The device he most frequently uses is the inexpressibility topos. For example, when the dreamer acknowledges his good fortune at being in the dream landscape, he asserts that his surroundings are beyond his ability to articulate: More of wele was in that wyse Then I cowthe telle thagh I torn hade,</page><page sequence="6">20 Religion &amp; literature For urthely herte myght not suffyse To the tenthe dole of tho gladnes glade. (133-36) [There was more joy in that situation than I could tell though I had leisure, for an earthly heart might not suffice to appreciate the tenth part of that gladness]. The narrator also uses earthly superlatives to give his audience some hint of the glory of heaven. The cliffs that he sees in his dream were incredibly beautiful. "The lyght of hem," he says, myght no mon leven, The glemande glory that of hem glent; For wern never webbes that wyyes weven Of half so dere adubbcment. (69-72) [The light of them no man might believe, the gleaming glory that shone from them, for never were there tapestries woven by men of half so glorious splen- dor]. Later, the maiden says that the great generosity that the landlord in the Parable of the Vineyard shows to the laborers who came just before quitting time pales in comparison to the mercy God will show human beings (576). And when the narrator sees the New Jerusalem, he is so "ravyste wyth glymme pure" [enraptured with pure radiance] that "Hade bodyly burne abiden that bone, / Thagh alle clerkes hym hade in cure, / His lyf wer loste" [had any man bodily experienced that boon, though all clerics had him in their care, his life would be utterly lost] (1088, 1090-92). The earth-bound language of men cannot do justice to heavenly things, and human faculties are inadequate to experience in a physical way the wonders of the heavenly city. On occasion, as J. Allan Mitchell observes, the narrator lets his silence stand in the place of speech that is inadequate to the task (93). When he first sees his "pearl" in the dream, the narrator is overwhelmed. "I stod as hende as hawk in halle" [I stood as quiet as a hawk in hall], he says (184). Later he uses the same strategy when he first sees the walls of the heavenly city; he "stod as stylle as dased quayle" (1085).5 On both occasions, the narrator is so overwhelmed by what he sees that no speech would suffice to articulate his experience.6 The otherness of God in Pearl is particularly evident when, instead of giving a physical description of God, the narra- tor relies upon metonymy; he talks about the throne, the river that flows from the throne, and the light emanating from the One occupying the throne. This passage is rather like an account in Exodus of the occasion when Moses and the elders of Israel saw God. Nothing is disclosed of God's appearance, except that "[u]nder his feet was something like a</page><page sequence="7">LAWRENCE BEASTON 2 1 pavement made of sapphire, clear as the sky itself" (24. 10).7 As James L. Kugel says of this passage, "the narrative eye immediately drops from the sight of God Himself to the dazzling brickwork 'underneath His feet,' as if even this one golden opportunity to confront God head-on, so to speak, must end in an averted gaze" (55). The God of Pearl is equally beyond description. The second person of the Trinity receives more direct descriptive detail in the poem, but a descriptive detail that emphasizes his otherness. There is something anthropomorphic about Him, but He is constantly referred to in non-human terms as the Lamb, a metaphor which stresses his gentleness and his role as a sacrifice. We are also reminded of his otherness by the fact that He is polygamous and possesses a constantly bleeding heart, and like the One who sits on the throne, the Lamb is glimpsed only from a distance as He participates in the heavenly procession. We never see Him up close, and we know what He thinks only from what the maiden tells us. If God, in his absolute power, was beyond the understanding of human beings, many fourteenth-century theologians like Ockham held that, in order that human beings might have some basis for relating to Him, God agreed to behave in certain predictable ways. As Ockham explained, God is capable, in his potentia absolute, of doing things that He does not do precisely because He has voluntarily limited his action to his potentia ordinata {QuodlibetalW, Q. 1, 491-92). The limitations of his power are made explicit in his various covenants with human beings. For ex- ample, God provides grace to baptized human beings and makes that grace essential to salvation (Ockham, QuodlibetalW, Q. 1, 492-93; Wood 353), even though in his potentia absoluta God could save unbaptized per- sons if He so chose (Wood 357). With respect to His potentia ordinata, then, humans have a way of relating to him, and so long as they too behave in certain ways, they can be assured that they will be justified in his eyes, even though, in his potentia absoluta, God is not compelled to do anything in response to human action (Wood 356). The maiden refers to the notion of God's potentia ordinata when she mentions God's promises (305). Later, she seems certain that God will behave predictably, when she refers to the sacrifice that was made by Christ (649-52) and the baptism that "wasches away the gyltes felle / That Adam wyth inne deth uus drounde" [washes away the deadly sins with which Adam drowned us in death] (655-56). Moreover, He will forgive sinners who are contrite: Grace innogh the mon may have That synnes thenne new, yif him repente,</page><page sequence="8">22 Religion &amp; Literature Bot wyth sorw and syt he mot hit crave, And byde the payne thereto is bent. Bot resoun, of ryght that con noght rave, Saves evermore the innossent; Hit is a dom that never God gave, That ever the gyltles schulde be schente. (66 1 -68) [Grace enough the man may have who sins then anew, if he repents, but he must crave it with sorrow and grief and endure the pain that is attached thereto. But reason, which cannot stray from right, forever saves the innocent; that the guiltless should ever be destroyed is a judgment that God never made] . Those Christians who have fallen into sin have at their disposal the penitential system by which to secure God's forgiveness. The maiden then asserts, as previously noted, that God would never condemn the innocent. She indicates that reason conforms to right. God, she says, would not violate the judgment He has made. But she never denies that God could do so, if He so chose. The theory of the two powers of God seems to preserve God's sovereignty by asserting his absolute power while accommodating free will by positing a system whereby humans could take advantage of God's grace and thereby achieve salvation. While both Bradwardine and Ockham agree that God is omnipotent and that human beings have free will, Ockham's emphasis on free will comes at the expense of God's omniscience. For certain, Ockham explic- itly professes God's omniscience. He held in Assumption 6 of his Tractatus de praedestinatione et de praescientia Dei etjuturis contingentibus that future events dependent upon the will of created beings are known by God "with certainty." Ockham admits, though, that "[i]t is difficult ... to see how He knows this" {Predestination 48). Subsequently, however, Ockham says God knows future contingents "contingently" (Predestination 57), opening the door to the idea that God's knowledge is limited by the actions of created beings.8 Hence, the importance of the human contribution to human salvation is underscored. Ockham's followers were much less hesitant than Ockham himself about abandoning the notion of God's omniscience. Thomas Buckingham, for example, concludes that although God sees every potential outcome of human decisions, He must wait, like human beings, to see which potentiality will become actual (Dolnikowski 221). Buckingham insists that God's experience of time is similar to that of human beings, not, says Dolnikowski, because he wanted to assert human free will so much as because he wanted to allow God room to change his mind (223), but both Buckingham's and Holcot's emphasis on human will</page><page sequence="9">LAWRENCE BEASTON 23 did have the effect of minimizing God's direct involvement in the affairs of men (Dolnikowski 228). The notion of the two powers of God and the thinking of men like Ockham, Buckingham, and Holcot implied a God who is distant from His creation. Ultimately, it meant a God who creates a universe that operates by certain predictable laws, a God who makes Himself subject to those ordained laws and provides as a part of that creation the means by which human beings can determine the course of their own existence. Having created and established the order of the universe, this God retires from day-to-day involvement; He becomes a distant prime mover (Dolnikowski 1 75-76). The severing of God's potentia absolute from his potentia ordinata had the effect, says Willemien Otten, of creating "a discrepancy between the volitional actions of the Divine and their intelligible reflections in the workings of nature" (264). Otten argues that the dissolution of the idea of a harmony between God and nature, a dissolution associated with the emergence of fourteenth-century nominalism, started much earlier than the fourteenth century. He sees evidence of the breakdown as early as the twelfth century in the rhetoric of the Chartrians, particularly Thierry of Chartres, and in the nature poetry of Alan of Lille (266). The emergence of the natural world as a thing of interest in itself, says Otten, is the common feature of Thierry's and Alan's thinking. In his Tractatus de sex dierum operibus, Thierry sets out his explanation of the causes of the world. The efficient cause, he says, is God; the formal cause is divine wisdom; the final cause is divine benignity; and the four elements are the material cause. The first three causes are associated with persons of the Trinity, and the last cause is associated with nature. Thus, Thierry accords nature a status as secondary cause, but by designating nature as the fourth, the material, cause, Thierry suggests that nature, in Otten's words, "somehow contributed to its own generation" (273). Similarly, Alan of Lille personi- fies this secondary cause in his poetry. Nature becomes, in Otten's words, "a full-blown goddess, who mediates between sublunar humans and a transcendent Creator" (277). Thus begins a subtle drift towards interest in nature not for what knowledge it can impart about the Creator but as an object of interest in itself. "As the sympathy for Lady Nature gains promi- nence," Otten writes, "the exegetical message recedes more and more into the background" (281). And so does God Himself. This marked separation of God from creation is the state of things at the beginning of Pearl. The narrator has freely and willfully rejected God: "Thagh kynde of Kryst me comfort kenned, / My wreched wylle in wo ay wraghte" [Though the nature of Christ offered me comfort, my wretched</page><page sequence="10">24 Religion &amp; Literature will labored in woe] (55-56). He is preoccupied with the created world, or, more accurately, a gap in that world - that is, the absence of his pearl. Indeed, the tendency to see the natural world as a good in itself is precisely the narrator's problem at the outset of the poem. He is guilty of what Augustine would call cupidity (18). He loves his pearl not for God's sake nor, one could argue, even for her sake; he loves her for his own sake. "Ofte haf I wayted," says the narrator, "wyschande that wele / That wont was whyle devoyde my wrange, / And heven my happe and al my hele" [Often have I watched and wished for that precious one, who was wont to dispel my sorrow and improve my good fortune and my well-being] (14-16). For the narrator, his love for his pearl has resulted in a state in which the natural has become unable to reflect or refract divine reality. The Transcendent God of Pearl Insofar as the God of Pearl is depicted as a being remote from the narrator's world, He is similar to the God of the Pelagiani moderni. Unlike the God in Cleanness and Patience, the God who appears in the Pearl- narrator's dream does not appear to interact directly with human beings in the earthly world. The vast distance between Pearl's narrator and the One seated on the throne in the New Jerusalem is quite vividly depicted within the dream itself by the river that prevents the narrator from drawing near to the heavenly city. Initially, everything the narrator learns about God and life in heaven comes from the mouth of the Pearl-maiden, though later he is able to observe God and the inhabitants of heaven from afar. Even the maiden is kept at a distance from the narrator by the river. Though he can see her across the stream and communicate with her, physical contact is impossible. No living human, the maiden tells him, may cross the river (323-24). It is both the edge of mortality and the boundary to his dream, for when he later plunges into that stream, he promptly wakes. The river is, as we subsequently learn, the limit of his Prince's pleasure, an impedi- ment to the fulfillment of the narrator's deepest desire. In the river image, the poet has found a sharp and concrete way of representing the vast difference that fourteenth-century theologians insisted separates human from divine. The separation of the narrator from the maiden is constantly brought to the reader's attention in a number of other ways as well. Besides the physical separation, there is an emotional distance. When the narrator expresses his great joy at being reunited with his "pearl," she says, "So madde ye be!" (290). She then chastises him for being proud, discourteous,</page><page sequence="11">LAWRENCE BEASTON 25 and presumptuous for thinking that he could dwell with her in this strange world across the river. Her coldness rather dashes his hopes and confounds him, and readers are likely to be surprised at her lack of sympathy. The emotional distance between the narrator and the maiden is evident in the well-discussed difference between the narrator's language and that of the maiden. As several critics observe, the narrator uses the language of love, poetry, and romance at the beginning of the poem (Aers 57; Beal 9; and Clopper, "God" 12). He describes his lost pearl as he would describe a lover: So rounde, so reken in uche araye, So smal, so smothe her sydes were, Quere-so-ever I jugged gemmes gaye, I sette hyr sengeley in synglere. (5-8) [So round, so beautiful in every setting, so small, so smooth were her sides, wherever I judged bright gems, I set her apart as singular] . The description of the "erber grene" [green garden] (38-46) has many similarities to the description of a garden in a romance, though the reference to August rather than springtime and the allusions to death - "crokes kene" [sharp sickles] and "schadowed" - provide an interesting contrast to the expected references to new life usually found in romances. Furthermore, the poet ventures into his dream as though he were a knight beginning a quest. He notes that he is going "In aventure ther mervayles meven" [On adventure where marvels occur] (64). The maiden's language at the beginning of the dream, on the other hand, is not romantic at all, though later she does use the language of love to refer to the Lamb.9 As Clopper notes, the difference between the attitudes of the narrator and the maiden is pointedly indicated by the dissimilar ways they use the word vuyrde. When he asks, "What wyrde has hyder my juel vayned, / And don me in thys del and gret daunger?" [What wyrde has sent my jewel hither and put me in this grief and great distress?] (249-50), the dreamer means "chance," but when the maiden responds that "thou [the dreamer] has called thy wyrde a thef " [you have called your wyrde a thief] (273), she uses vuyrde to refer to God (Clopper, "God" 13). He assumes the essential meaninglessness of his situation, while she sees it as providential. Reinforc- ing the sense of distance between the narrator and the maiden is the fact that their two worlds seem to operate according to two different sets of logic. As noted, the maiden tells the dreamer that "The court of the kyndom of God alyve / Has a property in hytself beyng" [The court of the kingdom of the living God has a property of its own] (445-46). Indeed,</page><page sequence="12">26 Religion &amp; Literature the so-called debate between the dreamer and the maiden indicates differ- ences in what each considers reasonable. The clash between the two types of logic is apparent when the dreamer objects to the notion that his "pearl" could be queen of heaven. Mary, he says, has that distinction (425- 28). It is difficult for one used to the ways of earth to expect that Alle that may therinne [i.e., in heaven] aryve Of alle the reme is quen other kyng, And never other yet schal depryve, Bot uchon fayn of otheres hafyng, And wolde her corounes wern worthe tho fyve. (447-5 1) [Everyone who may arrive therein is queen or king of all the realm, and never will one deprive another, but each one is glad for the others' having and wishes their crowns were worth five such] . Though the dreamer seems to acquiesce to the maiden's description of the social relations in heaven, he steadfastly refuses to believe that his pearl, who died before she even learned to pray, should be treated as an equal to those who, at great sacrifice to themselves, lived long and virtuous lives. In his estimation, "That cortayse is to fre of dede" [That courtesy is too generous in deed] (481). The logic of the maiden and of heaven seems perfect nonsense to the narrator. Another example of this disparity in the way the maiden and the narrator view reality is their different interpretations of the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard. As previously noted, the maiden sees the fact that the lord of the vineyard pays even the workers who arrive late in the day the same wages he had agreed to pay those who worked the whole day as an illustration of God's generosity (605). But from a more worldly point of view, the narrator, as Rhodes (121) and Aers (71) note, sees this action as unfair. In addition to the narrator's separation from the heavenly city in the dream and the emphasis on God's otherness, the sense of the narrator's distance from God is intensified when he suddenly awakes from his dream to find himself in his earthly surroundings - "thys doel-doungoun" [this dungeon of sorrow] (1 187), as he calls it. No longer within sight of the divine throne, he is left with only slender links to God, the "bred and wyn" (1209) of the Eucharist. These elements, whether they are symbols or substances of Christ, stand in the place of one who is not totally present, thus reinforcing the sense of God's distance.</page><page sequence="13">LAWRENCE BEASTON 27 The Immanent God of Pearl The poem begins with the narrator in need of deliverance from a paralyzing sorrow. But as Aers observes, neither the maiden's words nor the vision of the New Jerusalem brings about that needed transformation. At the very end of the dream, he returns to the preoccupation with his lost pearl (Aers 64, 67; Beal 19). When he awakes, he seems still to be alienated from God, but the separation of the narrator from God at the end of the poem is different from their separation at the beginning. At the end of the poem, the narrator is no longer paralyzed by his grief. He is resigned to his loss and comforted by the thought that his pearl is in heaven. His life is reoriented toward pleasing God. He is delivered from the cupidity of valuing created things for their own, or for his own, sake and not for God's, and his ability to see the symbolic connection of creation to God is restored. But something more than the maiden's rhetoric, something more than the vision of the heavenly city accounts for the change. For Aers, the change is too little, too late (70). He argues that except for the last few lines when the "I" becomes "us," the narrator has never seen himself in any relationship of believers, has never seen himself as a part of the commu- nity of grace. There is indeed an incongruity between the narrator's state of mind at the end of the dream and his attitude at the time of the telling of his story that is difficult to explain. Yet he is, in fact, delivered from his debilitating sorrow; something mysterious and incomprehensible occurs between his waking and his story. The gap between the resurgent desire of the narrator to join the maiden by crossing the river and the desire to know more of his Prince's "mysterys" (1 194) is itself a mystery. It is the mystery both of grace and of free will, the contingency of his choice, and though the dream does not lead directly to the narrator's transformation, it undoubtedly has something to do with that change. Nicholas Watson makes the case that Pearl refigures the distinction in medieval thought between active and contemplative Christians; the poet sets active Christians in the place of the former Christian heroes - the "virgins, martyrs and preachers" (311). According to this "vernacular theology," active Christians work out their salvation by turning their attention to outward aspects of life. Emphasis falls not on cultivating the spirit, but rather on one's behavior ("sheer manners") in the world, where the courtliness of the poet's audience becomes symbolic of the relation- ships of the inhabitants of the heavenly city (Watson 310-11). The poet, says Watson, attempts to envision heaven in the image of a "rarefied court culture" (297). He acknowledges, however, that mortals are incapable of</page><page sequence="14">28 Religion &amp; Literature the perfection which God demands. But in terms of the covenanted relationship God established with human beings, imperfect men and women can "do by grace . . . what they cannot by effort." This grace, Watson says, is imparted "through participation in the sacraments" (306). The rites of the church, what Watson calls the "sacerdotal machinery of baptism, confession, penance, and mass," are, in fact, features of the covenantal order that God is said to have established by means of His ordained powers (304). To the extent that the narrator sees his primary connection to God as "bred and wyn," Watson has it exactly right. Human salvation is achieved by means of a system of "sacerdotal machinery" that God has ordained and made available to all. This sacramental system makes up for human beings' inability to behave with perfect "courtesy," which is another form of conformance to the moral laws of God which were so important to Pelagius and his immediate followers. Even though the Pearl-poet, in Watson's formulation of the poet's theology, recognizes the powerlessness of human beings to please God by their actions, this vernacular theology is still Pelagian because salvation results from human action, the ability of men and women to do good by participating in the sacraments of the Church. What Watson's vernacular theology ignores, however, is the fact that the sacramental links of "bred and wyn" are not the narrator's only connec- tion to God. The narrator tells the reader in the final stanza of the poem that he has come to know God in a more personal and intimate way; he has found God a "frende ful fyin." Such a characterization - we are never told how the narrator comes to know God as a friend - suggests a God who is present in a more immediate way than through dreams and symbolic representations. The description of God as a friend connotes a more personal and direct encounter than does a relationship pursued through the "sacerdotal machinery" of God's ordained order. It suggests the relationship with an agent who engages with his creatures outside the carefully defined and formal order of a contractual relationship; it sug- gests a God who touches humans by means other than secondary causes. If, in fact, we examine the narrator's story looking for evidence of God's presence in the narrator's life, we must conclude that God has indeed taken a very active role in the narrator's salvation, intervening directly in the narrator's life throughout the poem, not just in the final stanzas. Christ, in fact, makes the first move when, at the beginning of the poem, he extends an offer of comfort to the narrator, an offer that is rebuffed (55). Then, as the narrator falls asleep in the garden where he lost his pearl, God intervenes in the narrator's life a second time. The narrator tells us</page><page sequence="15">LAWRENCE BEASTON 29 that his "goste is gon in Godes grace" [spirit goes in God's grace] (63). In other words, the narrator's deliverance from his overwhelming grief is initiated by God, who acts despite the fact that the narrator resisted Christ's healing consolation. The dream itself, then, is an intervention of God, as the narrator comes to realize when he later determines his dream to be a "veray avysyoun" [true vision] (1 184). There is, of course, as Bogdanos points out, biblical support for the notion of dreams as revelation, and medieval culture recognized the significance of certain dreams (35). Bogdanos notes that two types of dream in Macrobius's typology of dreams have truth value. The narrator's dream, says Bogdanos, could be considered either of these types - an oraculum, in which a revered person discloses the future or tells the dreamer what to do, or a somnium, which presents truth in a veiled way (35-36). The fact that the maiden seems to be speaking for God when she instructs and chastises the dreaming narrator lends support to the notion of the dream as divine intervention. Moreover, the dreamer's future behavior seems to have been anticipated by an omniscient God, for when the dreamer asks to see the heavenly city, the maiden indicates she has already secured the Lamb's permission for the dreamer to see "that clene cloystor" [that fair castle], though she warns that he is not permitted to set foot in the city (965-72). The divine nature of the dream becomes even more apparent just before he awakes. The narrator states that because of his failed effort to cross the stream, "Out of that caste I was bycalt" [out of that intention I was called] (1 163). The implication is that the narrator's dream, so long as it lasts, is continuously sustained and, indeed, willed by God. But perhaps the most compelling reason to believe that the dream is from God is the salutary effect it has on the narrator. The dream points to other ways by which God has directly involved Himself in his creation. It reminds the reader of God's intervention in human history in the person of Christ. In response to the narrator's apparent confusion of the New Jerusalem with the old Jerusalem, the maiden is careful to distinguish between the heavenly city and the earthly Jerusalem where, she says, God was part of human history. She highlights God's active role when she notes that it was in Jerusalem that "the Lombe con fonde / To soffer inne sor for manes sake" [the Lamb hastened to suffer in sorrow for man's sake] (939- 40). The Lamb is portrayed as actively seeking out the earthly Jerusalem so that He might suffer on behalf of human beings. Constant references to John's Apocalypse remind us of God's involve- ment in his creation in another way - that is, by means of biblical revela- tion. The narrator's repeatedly mentioning that his vision of the heavenly</page><page sequence="16">30 Religion &amp; Literature city is exactly like John's signifies not only that his experience is confirmed by John's but also that John's vision is confirmed by the dreamer's. His subsequent acceptance of the veracity of the biblical dream suggests that he has taken the maiden's advice to trust in God's revelation rather than to depend upon what he learns from his observation of creation. The fact that the narrator's dream seems to be consistent with Christian teaching and the fact that his vision of the heavenly city is consistent with the biblical vision of John can be taken as evidence that the dream does, in fact, have "gostly [. . .] porpose" [spiritual purpose] (185). In addition to the portrait of an indescribable and strange being enthroned in the distance of the heavenly city, then, there is another, subtler portrait of God as a being closely involved in the lives of human beings, and this immanent God is not something inserted ineffectually at the last moment, as Aers might argue; it is there all along. Even if he does not consider himself part of the community of grace until the very end, the narrator is in relation- ship with God from the very beginning of the dream, a relationship the narrator himself does not fully recognize until later. To be sure, the immanent God of Pearl is no more susceptible to description than the transcendent one. When the narrator tells us that his "goste is gon in Godes grace" (63) there is no elaboration. The phrase "in Godes grace" seems almost a conventional tag uttered without any reed consciousness of its meaning. This immanent God is, in fact, much more elusive than the transcendent God. He does not occupy so prominent a place in the narrative as does the God featured in the narrator's dream; He is not a character who ever comes into the reader's view. Indeed, we are never told on what ground the narrator encounters his "frende." This immanent God seems to be more a providential force permeating the narrator's existence than an actor who can be located even in fictional space. God's Sovereignty and Human Freedom The Pearl-poet, then, brushes two portraits of God onto his narrative canvas, creating something like those ambiguous drawings that appear at first glance as one thing and upon further examination as something else. The poem foregrounds the portrait of a distant and transcendent God in all his majesty and glory, a God too aloof to be concerned with the day-to- day affairs of the world on the narrator's side of the river. This God, which resembles the remote prime-mover God of the Pelagiani moderni, is the same God signified after the narrator's return to his waking life in the form of "bred and wyn" and represented in the dream as the Lamb. But hidden</page><page sequence="17">LAWRENCE BEASTON 3 1 within the lines, shapes, and colors of the portrait of this transcendent God is the less obvious depiction of an immanent God who involves Himself in the details of the narrator's life, the God whom the narrator calls, somewhat paradoxically, the "kynde of Kryst" at the beginning of the poem and his "frende ful fyin" at the end. By allowing these two divine portraits to stand with no attempt to resolve their contradiction, the poet implies several things. Representing God in this way has, as Clopper says of the paradox of the two powers of God, the "capacity to suggest mystery and to inspire awe" ("God" 2). The apparent contradiction makes God seem unsearchable. This way of representing God also implies the inad- equacy of finite human language to capture an infinite deity. Indeed, as we have seen, the transcendent God whom the narrator sees in his dream surpasses the descriptive capabilities of human language, but despite the poet's remarkable ability to stretch the limits of human language, a God who is both transcendent and immanent not only slips the bonds of human language and human narrative but also defies human logic, includ- ing the rule against self-contradiction. He exceeds the grasp of human reason. While the God of Pearl, then, is not subject to close description and does not conform to human logic, the poem does, it is true, acknowledge the probative value of sensory evidence. The narrator was, after all, granted this vision of God and the New Jerusalem with the full permission of the Lamb. His perceptions of the divine world, however, dissolve as he wades into the river. They escape the grasp of his senses, and he finds himself in the very place where he had fallen asleep. The poem recognizes the value of seeing, but it also recognizes the inadequacy of seeing. The maiden says as much when she tells the narrator: "Thou says thou trawes me in this dene, / Bycawse thou may wyth yyen me se" [You say you believe me to be in this valley because you can see me with your eyes] (295-96). The subtle suggestion is that she really is not where he sees her at all. A few lines later, she says that there is little to praise about one "That leves wel that he ses wyth yye" [who believes firmly what he sees with eye] (302). Her words recall Jesus' words to Thomas: "[B]lessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed" (John 20.29). The maiden wants to convince the narra- tor, in the words of the writer of Hebrews, to be "sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see" (11.1). In the fined analysis, the narrator, she says, ought to trust in God's promises, not his own sensory powers (301-304). Neither should this lesson be lost on the readers as they view the two portraits of God in the poem, for one function of their contradiction is to underscore the inadequacy of both representations.</page><page sequence="18">32 Religion &amp; Literature Both portraits are, as Clopper says, simply ways God has chosen to reveal Himself at a particular time and place to, in this case, the narrator ("God" 6), and if readers are invited to think of God as something resembling these two portraits, they are also warned that He is, in fact, something quite different. One must never overlook the limited spatial and temporal perspective of human beings when thinking about the infinite being of God. In fact, the differences in the way humans and God experience time is, according to Dolnikowski, a key factor in the way Bradwardine formulated his understanding of both how God could be sovereign and in no way subject to the actions and choices of His creatures and, at the same time, how humans could still have free will. Like Boethius, Bradwardine considered God as being outside of time, experiencing all that happens at once and eternally (I, 7, 189C). He thought of the difference in divine and human perspectives in terms of a geometrical figure: a revolving circle whose center is God and whose circumference consists of points in time. While the circle may be in motion, the center is stationary (I, 24, 243D). From their perspective on the circumference of Bradwardine's circle, human beings experience life as constantly changing, and they see it from the narrow perspective of one point on the circle, the present moment. Because the God at the center sees all time at once, His knowledge is complete, but human beings do not know the future, and because of their limited perspective, their knowledge of the past and present is incomplete. According to Bradwardine, human freedom must be understood as a function of time. Human beings make choices within their limited tempo- ral perspective, without knowing the consequences of their decisions (Dolnikowski 186). God, because, in Bradwardine's view, He sees all time at once, does not have to withhold his judgment until He sees what human beings do, for He knows what choices they will make, though, even so, His action is not contingent upon human choices. God's ability to know all time at once, however, does not mean that what humans do in time is irrelevant to his judgment. While God's will, according to Bradwardine, is "naturally prior" to human salvation, human will, too, is essential; human choices do count (I, 41, 371 A). The Pearl-poet, in fact, may have had a similar conception of time. The river does seem to be conceived as the boundary of time between human and divine; the land across the river from the narrator is a world outside time. It is, according to the maiden, a place where peace "ay schal laste wythouten reles" [shall last forever without end] (956). The narrator refers to it as a "kythe that lastes aye" [land that lasts forever] (1 198). It is a world</page><page sequence="19">LAWRENCE BEASTON 33 that has neither sun nor moon to mark the hours and days (1044).10 Nor are there seasons to mark the passing year, for the trees bear fruit every month (1079). Moreover, the gates of the heavenly city are never shut (1065). The city, in fact, seems frozen, as static as the text of John's Apocalypse. Even the events which occur in the heavenly city have a kind of ever-present quality. Though there is reference to new arrivals in the New Jerusalem (447), the population seems to be always the same - the number of maidens, in particular, being a constant 144,000 (869-70). Although Christ and his brides march in procession to the throne (1113), the elders fall prostrate (1120), and angels scatter incense (1122), these occurrences seem framed as ritualized action that happen not once but eternally. Even the effects of Christ's crucifixion have a timeless quality; his heart bleeds incessantly (1 137). And God Himself does not change, according to the maiden. "Of the way a fote ne wyl he wrythe" [Nor will he turn aside one foot from the way] (350), whatever human beings may think of Him and His acts. The Pearl-poet may have envisioned the narrator's freedom in terms of his position in a time-bound world. He makes choices as a result of God's intervention, but his choices are not determined by God. God does not, by divine fiat, cause the narrator to want to "please the prince." The way the narrator construes his situation when he wakes is indeed interesting: I raxled, and fel in gret affray, And, sykyng, to myself I sayd: "Now al be to that Prynces paye." (1 174-76) [I stretched and became fearful, and, sighing, I said to myself, "Now all be according to the Prince's pleasure"]. After he comes to an awareness that he is awake and orients himself in his wakeful state, it seems to be with resignation that he surrenders himself to his prince's pleasure. It is as if he lets go all the resistence that he demonstrated when he rejected Christ's comfort and when he debated with the maiden in the dream. But in the next stanza he finds himself momentarily back in a "longeyng hevy" (1 180), presumably his longing to be with his pearl in the New Jerusalem. Then "rewfully" he cries, "O perle of rych renoun, / So was hit me dere that thou con deme / In this veray avysyoun" [O pearl of noble renown, what you spoke about in this true vision was so dear to me] (1 182-84). He seems, then, to be reconciled to his separation from the maiden. His references to the prince in lines 1 1 76, 1 188, and 1 189 direct the reader's attention back to the very first line of the poem - "Perle, plesaunte to prynces paye" - which appears now to be</page><page sequence="20">34 Religbn &amp; Literature referring to God or to Christ. It may not be entirely coincidental that he should characterize himself as giving up resistence rather than expressing a more positive turning toward God. Stump says that Augustine's difficulty with reconciling his conflicting beliefs in the sovereignty of God and the free will of human beings "would be solved if he could find a way to hold that human beings are able, on their own, to reject grace, without God's being ultimately responsible for their doing so" (139). She then presents the possibility that acceptance and rejection may not be the only options, a possibility that, she says, was acknowledged by Aquinas (140). One could, she says, cease to reject yet not accept grace, which may, in fact, be what the narrator does when he awakes. Stump's point seems to be that ceasing to reject God is not, in itself, a good act and may therefore be done on one's own without God's help. Once the resistence ceases, then grace works on the person's will to effect a positive acceptance of God's salvation (141). In other words, free will is exercised when one chooses to stop resisting God, but then God is the active agent in causing the person to accept grace positively. In the case of the Aar/-narrator, God's grace, of course, is at work long before the narrator gives up his resistance. And his resistance persists until after he awakes from his dream, up to the moment he recognizes that his desire exceeded what was pleasing to the prince. The surrender of his resistance is followed by his encounter with God as friend. The "prince's pleasure," along with all the other divine interventions, may be conceived as God's part in the narrator's salvation. The narrator, on the other hand, exercises free will by relinquishing his own will in favor of the prince's, which action is a ceasing to resist, in Stump's terms. God's grace and human free will, then, meet when the narrator sacrifices his own will in favor of that of his prince, and he then comes to know God's friendship. Whether this formulation would meet all the objections that Oxford clerks could muster is doubtful. One could expect to encounter an unwillingness on their part to acknowledge that God's action could ever be, as Stump says, "responsive to something in human beings, even if that something is not good or worthy of merit" (142). As Clopper cautions, however, we should not expect the same sort of philosophical precision from the Pearl- poet that an Ockham or a Bradwardine would demand ("God" 2). The Pearl-poet's medium is not philosophy but poetry. The poet's purpose is not to contribute to the theological debate with another treatise on the fine points of grace and free will. Rather, his poem as a whole serves the same purpose as both the dream it contains and the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard. It is a fictional construct designed to illustrate the intersec-</page><page sequence="21">LAWRENCE BEASTON 35 tion between the divine and the earthly worlds. Watson rightly notes that the mark of all the poems of the Gawain-manuscript is their complex artistry. As he says, Pearl's theology is subordinated to its artistry (297). The poet may, in fact, conceive the harmony of his complex aesthetics as an analogue of the harmony of the universe, the work of a poet/creator. But, Watson says, the poet surely recognizes the "virtual incommensurability of the two orders of being" (298). This incommensurability of earth and heaven cannot be resolved but by God's grace, or, in aesthetic terms, as Watson says, by artistic craft. The narrator's purpose, I believe, is to formulate a narrative that would, by its sheer artistry, bring together and acknowledge the incomensurabilities of the transcendence and imma- nence of God and illustrate the tension between grace and free will in a way that would not create the kind of dissatisfaction in its audience as is aroused by the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard. Pearl, then, might be the attempt of another theologian - a vernacular theologian writing, as Watson maintains, for aristocratic lay people - to represent poetically, instead of geometrically as in the case of Bradwardine, the point where God and humans meet. The world that Pearl presents is no more substantial than the dream that the poem contains. Still, both the dream and the poem are useful, albeit inadequate, attempts to envision that which cannot be seen. Just as the vision of God and the New Jerusalem dissolves as the narrator attempts to cross the river, the God beyond the transcendent and immanent Gods of Pearl ultimately escapes the poet's craft. When the reader puts down the poem and, like the narrator, returns to the finite, time-bound world of the here and now, he or she might fall back into a world that becomes an object of interest in itself or merely a symbolic representation of a divine reality that escapes the reader's earthly realm. The poet, however, must be hoping that the reader might encounter God in the here and now as a "frende ful fyin," that the "I" of the narrator becomes the "we" of a community of grace that includes the reader.

Edith Dolnikowski suggests that Buckingham tempered his views on grace in response to adverse reaction (222). She also believes that scholars like Etienne Gilson and Gordon Leff exaggerate both the extent to which Ockham's thought was unor- thodox and the homogeneity of thought of those who came to be called "Ockhamists." 3. All quotations from Pearl are taken from Anderson. 4. For other discussions of this issue, see Bock; Clopper, "Form"; Haines; and Madeleva. 5. See Mitchell for a discussion of the way that the narrator reinforces the otherness of the heavenly world he experiences in his dream (92 ff.). 6. Theodore Bogdanos explores in detail the poet's use of symbolism in order to express the otherness of God and the divine realm. He proposes the notion of "dissimilar similitudes" as a way of reminding the reader of "the distance between divine reality and its human representation" (6). For example, when the narrator surveys the dream landscape with its trees whose trunks are blue and whose leaves are "bornyst syluer," he creates a "significandy ambivalent effect" (Bogdanos 43). The landscape is recognizable to one accustomed to an earthly environment, but the odd attributes of the trees and leaves give it an alien quality. 7. All quotations from the Bible are from the New International Version. 8. Rega Wood has argued that the charge of Pelagianism against Ockham is unfounded. According to Wood, unlike Pelagius, Ockham did not deny the doctrine of original sin nor assert that God's grace was unnecessary for salvation. (351). Moreover, says Wood, Ockham accepted the Council of Orange's position that the beginning of faith is always initiated by God (359). 9. Helen Barr argues that the maiden s language is predominancy courtly, with a high density of French words," but, at times, she uses a vernacular register (64). 10.
