Pérez de Heredia Puente Proyecto Arqueológico Chichen Itza-Instituto Nacional Antropología e Historia, Calle 31B # 258 × 24 y 26, Colonia Miguel Alemán, Mérida 97148 Abstract Our understanding of the history of ancient Chichen Itza has been advanced significantly in recent years by the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia’s Chichen Itza Archaeological Project. One important advance has been the definition of a new ceramic complex for the site of Yabnal, which dates to the Late Classic period, and corresponds to the Motul ceramic complex of Mayapan. The majority of materials used to define the Yabnal complex come from recent excavation of terraces and platforms distributed throughout the entire area occupied by Chichen Itza in its heyday, but also includes finds in association with the construction and use of buildings with rooms such as the substructure of the Temple of the Initial Series. The most important ceramic materials include complete and restorable vessels obtained from sealed contexts. The Yabnal ceramic complex displays a variety of local and imported wares, similar to those found elsewhere in the northern plains, with the Slate Ware group proving possibly the most important. Ceramic Slate Ware is a high-quality ceramic characterized by the frequent use of volcanic ash as temper, and demonstrates a deeply rooted tradition in northern Yucatan, spanning roughly 600 years. Although most recent discussion of ceramics at Chichen Itza has focused on the Terminal Classic and Postclassic periods, this study examines the early Yabnal ceramic complex of the Late Classic period with a focus on the site, its chronology, and the important implications this ceramic complex has for the general history of the northern plains.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS OF THE The characteristic forms of Say Slate, as based on the collection YABNAL-MOTUL COMPLEX AT CHICHEN ITZA of complete and restorable vessels recovered by the Chichen Itza Once the early Say Slate group was distinguished from other Slate Project, are shown in Figures 7 and 15.

The ceramic materials from the interior of the construction of Structure 5C4-I, shown on Table 7, illustrate a high amount of Yabnal-Motul complex fragments (91.3% of a collection of 209 sherds). We do not know if it was constructed immediately after, shortly after, or much later than the Motul platform. Based on the high frequency of Yabnal-Motul sherds, a date in the very late facet of the complex is reasonable; therefore, I suggest a date between a.d. 750 and 800 for this construction. Figure 13.

In 1998 I analyzed the recovered material and identified the presence of early Slate Ware of the Yabnal- Motul complex at Chichen Itza (Pérez de Heredia Puente 1998). A total of 2,368 sherds (representing 3.7% of the collection) were classified as pertaining to the Yabnal-Motul complex. The Yabnal-Motul ceramic collection from the Sacred Well is not only important for its quantity, but also for the diversity of ceramic types represented, the most varied found so far in a single context at the site, at 18 different types. Several of these types are not locally produced and can be used to trace possible political and/ or trade connections. Other Yabnal contexts are also noteworthy: • At the Mayaland Hotel, two vessels were found during the installation of an electric line. They formed part of an infant burial (Pérez Ruiz 1996), a Figure 18. Cache inside a cist in lower circular platform (Brainerd basin and a tripod plate. Both vessels show extensive wear, and both form 1958:Figure 68e). part of the Say Slate group (Chemax Black on Slate type) (see Figure 21). A small frog decorates the interior of the plate in its center. • The collection of the Three Lintels Building’s chultun, reanalyzed in 2004, yielded a total of 4,958 sherds, of which 19% pertain to the settlement’s focal points. It should not be very surprising that Yabnal-Motul complex.
