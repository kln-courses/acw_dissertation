<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DREAM OF ALEXANDER IN JOSEPHUS ΑΚΓ. 11.325-39 BY TAETAE HUN KIM University of Notre Dame Summary In dialogue with the remarkably insightful publication "Alexander the Great andjaddua the High Priest According to Josephus" by Shaye J. D. Cohen (1982-83), this article argues that the story of Alexander-Jaddua meet ing in Antiquities may be more persuasively explained as a propagandistic mixture of elements found in several types of ancient dream narratives rather than as a single type such as the soteriological epiphany as defined by Cohen. Cohen's classification relies heavily upon how Alexander's dream narrative functions in the larger context, but the theme and con tent of Alexander's dream narrative are in themselves not soteriological but a propagandistic divine legitimization of his conquest. 1. 1. Introduction In the famous story of the meeting of Alexander the Great and Jaddua the high priest {Ant. 11.325-39), two divinely inspired dreams are used as the pivotal element that resolves the tension between the two main characters. On the night before Alexander's arrival in Jerusalem, Jaddua had a dream in the temple in which God encouraged him and ordered him to open the city gates and to greet Alexander with proper honor. Alexander, for his part, had had a dream three years earlier, before the commencement of his conquests, in which a figure in the high priestly garb promised him divine guidance and protection and urged him to cross over the Hellespont and conquer Asia. When Jaddua led out a multitude of fellow priests and citizens of Jerusalem in pro cession to welcome Alexander, the Macedonian king immediately rec ognized Jaddua to be the very person he had seen in his dream three years earlier. Falling upon the ground Alexander paid reverence to the © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2003 Journal for the Study of Judaism, XXXTV, 4 Also available online - www.brill.nl</page><page sequence="2">426 TAE HUN KIM name of God and kindly greeted Jaddua in view of everyone who had accompanied him, actions that greatly enhanced the honor of Jaddua and the Jewish state. Based on these two dream narratives, Shaye J. D. Cohen has sug gested that the Alexander-Jaddua story is a combination of two sub stories: an adventus story and an epiphany story.1 Cohen defines an adventus story as a narrative based on the ceremonial reception of a monarch or other dignitary upon his arrival at a city,2 while his model of a soteriological epiphany story features the following elements: (1) a city is under siege from a band of aggressors, frequently barbarians; (2) the defenders usually have a divine guardian or a special associa tion with a deity, and they often actively seek divine protection; (3) at the height of crisis, usually the night before the imminent fall of the city, a deity appears in a dream to a leading figure on either side, assuring the defenders of their miraculous rescue or terrifying the attack ers to lift the siege immediately; (4) the attackers comply under the divine threat, with or without knowing the identity of the deity.3 Cohen does recognize some difficulties with applying the literary cat egory of epiphany story to Alexander's dream. The main difficulties with this dream for an epiphany story, as Cohen explains, are, (1) this is not a dream for a wicked aggressor, which is a requisite element in a soteriological epiphany story; (2) the dream occurred almost three years earlier, when Alexander was still in Macedonia. In most of the epiphany stories the dream/vision of divine deliverance occurs the night before the main event. Therefore Cohen has suggested that the two dream stories were originally an independent soteriological epiphany narrative that closely conformed to the literary model of the soterio logical epiphany story as outlined above.4 This hypothetical original narrative was then extensively edited and combined with an adventus story by an anonymous editor to produce a single coherent narrative in the present form.5 In my opinion, Cohen is correct to recognize that the two dream stories function soteriologically in the larger narrative, 1 Shaye J. D. Cohen, "Alexander the Great and Jaddua the High Priest According to to Josephus," AJSR 7-8 (1982-83) 41-68, 44-45. 2 Cohen, "Alexander," 45. 3 Cohen, "Alexander," 49-51. 4 Cohen, "Alexander," 54-55. 5 Cohen doubts that Josephus was responsible for the fusion of the adventus and the epiphany stories, as the combination was too skillfully done to be Josephan. He says, "Had these stories been combined by Josephus, the union would have been much less harmonious" (55).</page><page sequence="3">THE DREAM OF ALEXANDER IN JOSEPHUS 427 in that they resolve the tension between the two main characters and thus save Jerusalem from the wrath of Alexander. It does not follow, however, that, simply because Alexander's dream story functions sote riologically, one must assume Alexander's dream story to be a heavily edited half of an original soteriological epiphany story. Cohen's hypo thesis is dependent upon his categorization of Alexander's dream story as a soteriological epiphany story, despite a number of problems he recognizes, because it is essential for his argument to demonstrate that the two dream stories of Alexander and Jaddua belong to a separate literary category from the rest of the larger narrative of Alexander's visit to Jerusalem. The logic of Cohen's argument is that, if a sub-story within a larger story belongs to a distinct genre different from the rest of the narrative, it must had been an independent piece of work that was later incorporated into the larger narrative. Hence the larger nar rative is by implication an artificial construct rather than a coherent and unified report of a single historical event. This then constitutes an argument against the authenticity of the event reported in the larger narrative. Cohen's essay has been widely accepted, and rightly so, as his work provides valuable insights into the story of Alexander and Jaddua. But there has not been a thorough attempt to re-examine the evidence he presents. This study attempts to analyze the story of Alexander's dream in relation to the definition of the category "epiphany story" that Cohen has suggested. It seeks to demonstrate that, though the story of Alex ander's dream functions soteriologically, one does not need to appeal to the soteriological epiphany to explain its origin, as it contains a num ber of characteristics that resonate with other categories of dream sto ries. Alexander's dream story, as we shall see, is better explained as a mixture of elements found in several types of ancient dream narratives rather than as a single type such as the soteriological epiphany. In this study the points of interest are: (1) a reputable figure sees in his dream an unidentified person who enjoys great divine blessings, and (2) the figure who saw the dream later meets a completely unknown person and immediately recognizes him as the person he saw in the dream. The function of this kind of dream story is propagandistic rather than soteriological, in that it enhances the honor of the person who appears in the dream, guaranteed by the honor and reputation of the person who reports the dream. This type of dream narrative seems to be more plausible as a thematic parallel to the dream of Alexander, as the entire Alexander-Jaddua narrative is clearly meant to be a propaganda piece</page><page sequence="4">428 TAE HUN KIM for the Jewish religion and the Jewish state. What I hope to demon strate in this study is that, (1) Alexander's dream story can be more persuasively explained as a parallel to other types of propagandistic dream stories. Appealing to the soteriological epiphany as the model of Alexander's dream story presupposes a very extensive revision of Alexander's dream story, for which there is little evidence. (2) As Cohen himself recognizes, the dream story of Alexander coheres very well with the rest of the Alexander-Jaddua narrative, so that it is implausible to divorce this story from the rest of the narrative as a discrete literary unit. Therefore, it seems more plausible to approach the Alexander Jaddua episode as a single coherent narrative rather than a combina tion of formally divergent narrative elements. 2. The Types of Dream Narratives in the Ancient Sources Since the subject of dream narratives in the ancient sources is a large one, in this study we will focus on a particular form of dream known an "audio-visual dream (ε'ίδωλον)."6 This category denotes dreams that feature both a visual object (usually a speaking figure) and an audi tory message orally transmitted to the dreamer. Notable examples of this type will be examined from both the Jewish and the Greco-Roman sources. In the Classical Greek and Hellenistic sources, the audio-visual dream usually includes an anthropomorphic figure (a deity, kinsman, friend, or other notable and recognizable figure of history or legend) standing over the dreamer and orally delivering a divinely inspired message.7 The figure is usually portrayed with divine qualities (luminous, extremely tall, beautiful, or with religious or political symbols that denote the significance of the figure) to add credence to the divine nature of the dream. If the dreamer forgot or was left unconvinced of the veracity and significance of the dream, the dream could be repeated, some times accompanied by a warning or threat against the dreamer to heed the dream message. The frequency of dreams is another feature, in 6 R. G. A. van Lieshout, Greeks on Dreams (Utrecht: HES, 1980), 21, 24; Eric R. Dodds, The Greeks and the Irrational (Berkeley: University of California, 1951), 104-09, 122; Robert K. Gnuse, Dreams and Dream Reports in the Writings of Josephus: A Traditio Historical Historical Analysis (AGJU 36; Leiden: Brill, 1996), 104. 7 John Hansen, "Dreams and Visions in the Graeco-Roman World and Early Christianity," ANRW 23.2: 1387-415, 1405-13.</page><page sequence="5">THE DREAM OF ALEXANDER IN JOSEPHUS 429 that one person may have a series of almost identical dreams on con secutive nights, or more than one person may independently have dreams that are concerned with similar issues. This so-called "double dream" creates a "circumstance of mutuality" between the dreamers, and functions to reinforce the dream message of both.8 2.1 An overview of biblical dream narratives Before we begin our survey of the Greco-Roman sources, it may be convenient to comment briefly on the dream types used in the OT. In a word, there is no direct biblical parallel to the story of Alexander's dream in Ant. 11.334-35. In the OT, the dream stories are centered on the content of the dream message, delivered in the form of a vocal or visual message, rather than describing the deliverer of that message. Therefore, in the OT there are relatively few examples of "audio visual" dreams, i.e., an anthropomorphic heavenly being used as the dream messenger. Rather, we predominandy find two types of dreams in the OT: (1) a simple oral message (auditory message dream) in which the dreamer hears a voice delivering a message to him without seeing anything; (2) a visual symbolic dream in which the dreamer observes a vision without an audible message or commentary, which is usually interpreted by someone else when the dreamer awakes.9 The dreams of the auditory message type may include Gen 20:1-18; 18:10-22; 31:1-54; 46:1-7; Num 22:8-13; 19-21; 1 Kgs 3:5-15; 1 Sam 3:1-21. The bibli cal dreams of the visual symbolic type are clustered in two large units: the Joseph narrative (Gen 37:5-11; 40:5-19; 41:1-36) and the dreams of Nebuchadnezzar (Dan 2:1-45; 4:4-27). The Midianite dream report in the Gideon narrative in Judg 7:13-15 is another example. Among the biblical dream narratives, there is no direct parallel to the story of Alexanders dream in Josephus. The only potential paral lei may be drawn from Dan 4:4-27, the dream of Nebuchadnezzar that forewarns him of his madness, dethronement, and final restora tion. Since the story of Alexander's dream is not an actual dream report but a summary of what Alexander saw, a direct comparison of form and semantics between Ant. 11.334-35 and Dan 4:4-27 is difficult. 8 Alfred Wikenhauser, "Doppeltraume." Biblica 29 (1948) 100-11, 106. 9 Gnusen, Dream Reports, 70-71; Jean-Marie Husser, Dreams and Dream Narratives in the Biblical World (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1999), 99-104.</page><page sequence="6">430 TAE HUN KIM Instead, it seems best to proceed with a comparison of common themes and features. Thematically, the possible points of correspondence are: (1) the dreamer is a great pagan king who previously had not been particularly well-disposed toward the Jews;10 (2) A positive change in his attitude toward the Jews is effected by his dream and its fulfillment, and great honor is given to the Jews as a result; (3) A human-like figure (an angelic watcher in Dan 4:13; Jaddua himself in Ant. 11.334) appears and delivers an oral message, though in a different way, so that both dreams belong to the category of audio-visual dream. On the other hand, the points of dissimilarity are: (1) In Antiquities Alexander is not presented as particularly hostile to the Jews. Nebu chadnezzar, however, destroyed Jerusalem and exiled the Jews. Nebu chadnezzar's change of attitude toward the Jews thus is much more dramatic. (2) Alexander's dream is a divine encouragement and promise of blessing; there is no punitive element in his dream. Nebuchadnezzar's dream foretells a divine castigation and punishment. (3) Alexander had a specific dream that answered specific concerns he already had in mind, and thus the dream functioned like an oracle, i.e., a divine response to Alexander's question regarding the outcome of his imper ial plan. Nebuchadnezzar's dream is an unsolicited vision of pending disaster, which does not address him personally or cater to his con cerns. Furthermore, the dream does not tell Nebuchadnezzar how to respond to what he saw in order to realize or to avoid the message contained therein. The call for repentance is not part of the dream proper but comes from Daniel, the dream interpreter. Nebuchadnezzar's dream thus functions more in line with a prophetic dream, a unilat eral communication initiated by God. (3) In Alexander's dream the dream figure (Jaddua) verbally addressed Alexander, and thus the pri vate oral message constituted the core of the dream. But in Daniel 4 the angelic watcher's message was not directly addressed to Nebuchad nezzar but given as a commentary that complemented the vision he saw. In this case both the vision and the words of the angelic watcher are combined to produce one complete dream message. (4) The mes sage of Alexander's dream was sufficiently clear that he could readily understand it without the aid of a dream interpreter. The identity of the dream figure still eluded him, yet Alexander did not call for a dream interpreter. But the dream message addressed to Nebuchadnezzar was 10 Incidentally, both Alexander and Nebuchadnezzar held supremacy over Asia, cap tured Tyre, went up to Jerusalem, invaded Egypt, and were the greatest kings of their dme.</page><page sequence="7">THE DREAM OF ALEXANDER IN JOSEPHUS 431 so cryptic that Daniel had to be brought in to explain to the king the meaning and the repercussions of his vision. Having considered these various points of similarity and dissimilar ity, it seems reasonable to conclude that both dream narratives share a common theme, i.e., a great pagan king becomes the protector of the Jews by means of a divinely-inspired dream, and the honor of the Jews is greatly increased as a result. In this sense, both dreams essen tially function as a propaganda piece for the Jews. However, these two dream narratives are so divergent in other aspects that there seems little evidence for a direct correlation between the two. Josephus may have been influenced by Daniel 4, but he seems to have borrowed only the common theme, and the rest of Alexander's dream story seems to exist independently of Daniel 4. The more promising parallels to the story of Alexander's dream may be found in the Greco-Roman literature. 2.2 An overview of possible Greek and Roman parallels Due to the very large number of dream narratives in Hellenistic and Greco-Roman literature, including numerous audio-visual dream sto ries, the main purpose of this section is to isolate dream stories that seem to share similarities with Alexander's dream narrative and yet do not belong to the literary category of soteriological epiphany as defined by Cohen. The first example is the series of dreams Xerxes saw when he was contemplating the campaign against Greece (Herodotus, Hist. 7.12, 14).11 The points of similarity with Alexander's dream story are: (1) the " In that story, Xerxes decided to invade Greece against the wise counsel of Artabanus, his uncle. But afterwards Xerxes rethought his position and decided that it was best not to invade Greece. In that night Xerxes saw a dream in which a "tall and hand some" man stood next to his bed and urged him not to alter his decision to invade Greece. When he awakened the next morning, however, Xerxes had forgotten about the dream and declared that he had changed his mind and would not invade Greece. In that night Xerxes saw another dream featuring the same man who threatened Xerxes to proceed with the proposed invasion of Greece or lose his throne. Terrified, Xerxes summoned Artabanus, the chief proponent of peace, and proposed that, in order to ascertain that it was indeed the will of a god that Xerxes should invade Greece, Artabanus was to wear the royal raiment, sit on the throne, and then sleep in the royal bed. When Artabanus fell asleep in Xerxes' bed, he saw the same man Xerxes had seen in his dreams. The man then accused Artabanus of trying to alter the course of history and threatened to blind him with hot irons [Hist. 7.17-18). Artabanus, convinced of the divine will, then became an avid advocate of the campaign against Greece.</page><page sequence="8">432 TAE HUN KIM setting is essentially identical with Alexander's dream, only in reverse. It is now the Persian king who is contemplating an invasion of Greece. (2) When Xerxes decided to abandon his plan, a "tall and handsome" man, a common description for a deity, appeared in his dream and urged Xerxes to continue with the plan. Thus the god responded to a specific concern Xerxes had. However, Xerxes was compelled to undertake the campaign against his will, whereas Alexander received encouragement and exhortation to proceed with his design. (3) The dreams of Xerxes occurred unsolicited, in the sense that Xerxes did not seek divine guidance to decide whether to invade Greece. The god in the dream came to Xerxes on his own volition.12 This dream is obviously not soteriological in any sense, as the Per sian empire was literally being urged by a god into commencing a wasteful campaign. Also the dreams of Xerxes and Artabanus seem to fit the model of a "dual dream" or "double epiphany" better than Alexander's dream narrative. There are direct correlations between those dreams (the identical god, the identical tenor of the message, three consecutive nights of dreams seen by two separate persons, the identical venue), and the combined dreams lead the narrative for ward to the resolution of the tension between Xerxes and Artabanus. The function of these dreams thus is to explain the source of the war between Greece and Persia and to lend it an aura of divine providence. The second example is a series of dream reports credited to Q. Lutatius Catulus concerning Octavian, the future Augustus.13 This story is immediately followed by another story of the same type featuring 12 But the dream of Artabanus was deliberately elicited to ascertain the veracity of the dreams of Xerxes and to confirm the divine will though a process similar to the Greek practice of incubation. 13 "After Q. Catulus had dedicated the Capitol, he had dreams on two nights in succession: first, that Jupiter Optimus Maximus called aside one of a number of boys of good family, who were playing around his altar (e praetextaris compluribus circum aram ludentibus unum secrevisse), and put in the fold of his toga an image of Roma, which he was carrying in his hand; the next night he dreamt that he saw this same boy in the lap of Jupiter of the Capitol, and that when he had ordered that he be removed, the god warned him to desist, declaring that the boy was being reared to be the savior of his country. When Catulus next day met Augustus, whom he had never seen before, he looked at him in great surprise and said that he was very like the boy of whom he had dreamed" (Suetonius, Aug., 2.94.8, Rolfe).</page><page sequence="9">THE DREAM OF ALEXANDER IN JOSEPHUS 433 Μ. Tullius Cicero.14 The points of correspondence between this type of dream and Alexander's dream narrative are: (1) the person who saw the dream ("A") is a reputable person with considerable fame, which confers a degree of credibility to his dream story.15 (2) The figure who saw the dream ("A") did not recognize the person he saw ("B"). As a literary device, this claim of anonymity enhances the objectivity of Catulus's report, as it establishes that Catulus had no formal connec tion to Augustus or to his family. Catulus did not recognize who Octavian was, only that he was a boy from a good family. Similarly, Alexander did not recognize who Jaddua was, but he at least seems to have realized that Jaddua was a human rather than a god. (3) Particular divine favor for "B" is clearly demonstrated in the dream. Jupiter showed great favor to Octavian, as well as prophesying that this boy would be the savior of his country. In Alexander's dream Jaddua spoke the words of God that assured Alexander of his success, and Alexander certainly recognized the honor of the high priesthood and the God Jaddua served when they met. (4) After the dream "A" meets "B" and immediately recognizes "B" to be the person he saw in the dream. Thus the great divine favor for "B" is confirmed by an independent authority "A," who prior to this had no relation to "B." In Alexander's dream story, on the other hand, the three-year gap between Alexander's dream and his meeting of Jaddua is a necessary condition for YHWH, represented by Jaddua, to have a crucial role in Alexander's conquests. Furthermore, the meeting of the two is another crucial element that resolves the tension between the two main char acters of the narrative. 14 "Μ. Cicero, as he was attending C. Caesar to the Capitol, happened to be telling some of his friends a dream which he had the preceding night, in which he saw a comely youth (puerum facie liberali), let down from heaven by a golden chain, who stood at the door of the Capitol, and had a whip put into his hands by Jupiter. And immediately upon sight of Augustus, who had been sent for by his uncle Caesar to the sacrifice, and was as yet perfectly unknown to most of the company, he affirmed that it was the very boy he had seen in his dream" (Suetonius, Aug., 2.94.9, Rolfe). 15 Q. Lutatius Catulus was consul in 78 b.c.e., and restored the burnt down Capitolium on Capitol Hill, the central symbol of the Roman religious system. Capitolium was a temple dedicated to Jupiter Optimus Maximus, Juno, and Minerva. It represented the foundation of the Roman religious system, and was frequendy the first temple built in a new Roman colony. Catulus also allegedly saw the dream after his dedication of Capitolium, which explains the association of Jupiter Optimus Maximus with the boy Octavian.</page><page sequence="10">434 TAE HUN KIM The function of this dream type is solely propagandistic, in that it serves no other purpose but to praise "B," Augustus, and to legitimize his supremacy over the res publica as divinely preordained by Jupiter Optimus Maximus. The political and religious significance of the Capitol plays a crucial role in these stories.16 However, the historicity of this story is doubtful, as Catulus died around 61 b.c.e. and Augustus was born in late 63 b.c.e. Therefore, Augustus could not have been more than a two-year old by the time Catulus died. So the term "boy (jbrae textatistextatis and puer used by Suetonius)" in his dream does not align well with known historical facts. Exactly how old Octavian was in his dream cannot be told, but wearing a toga praetextatis would put his age any where between 7 and 15, when the toga mrilis was usually assumed.17 Furthermore, Catulus was not on friendly terms with C. Julius Caesar, the famous uncle-adopted father of Augustus. C.Julius defeated Catulus in the election for the office of Pontifex Maximus in 63 b.c.e. and as a praetor in 62 b.c.e. demanded that Catulus should turn over to the people the record of his expenditure for the restoration of Capitolium. Therefore, to use Catulus as a mouthpiece of Augustan propaganda may not be the most reasonable choice, but then again this may have been a literary ploy to enhance the credibility of this story, i.e., one would expect Catulus to be the last person to aid the Caesarian cause. 3. An Analysis of the Narrative about Alexander's Dream Alexander's dream narrative is in fact not an actual dream report that can exist on its own, but a summary of his dream encapsulated within a supposedly historical narrative of his arrival in Jerusalem. Therefore, we must begin our analysis by examining the historical cir cumstances that led to Alexander's dream story in Ant. 11.334-35. Then a brief literary analysis of Alexander's dream story will follow. 16 The close association with Jupiter Optimus Maximus and the Scipionic legend (that P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus was a son of Jupiter and frequendy seen around the temple of Jupiter at night) is interesting as a potential parallel to these dream sto ries, as well as Cicero's report of Scipio Africanus appearing to Scipio Aemilianus in a dream [Resp. 6.9-29). 17 S. Dixon, The Roman Family (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1992), 101.</page><page sequence="11">THE DREAM OF ALEXANDER IN JOSEPHUS 435 3.1 The historical background of Alexander's dream One of the great difficulties in assessing the historical value of Alexander's visit to Jerusalem is that our knowledge of Alexander's remarkable career is so deficient and incomplete.18 Josephus is the only source that reports Alexander's visit to Jerusalem, and there is no other independent source that corroborates Josephus's account of Alexander and Jaddua in Antiquities. The record of Alexander's career in Antiquities is sketchy at best. Josephus seems to imply that Alexander and Jaddua came into their respective offices around the same time (Ant. 11.302-4).19 But this seems unlikely, as Jaddua probably had assumed his office much earlier than Alexander did.20 Alexander crossed the Hellespont in early 334 b.c.e. The decisive victories at Granicus (Ant. 11.313) and Issus (Ant. 11.314 16) gave him control over the vast territory west of the Euphrates. Alexander then moved south along the coastal plain through Syria without much opposition. Only Tyre and Gaza offered resistance and were captured after long sieges (332 b.c.e.; Ant. 11.317, 320). Then Alexander went down to Egypt, which surrendered peacefully, and he spent the winter of 332 b.c.e. there. Ant. 11.345 shows Alexander's intention to go down to Egypt and to use the Samaritan troops under Sanballat to garrison the land. He later moved out of Egypt and invaded 18 The primary evidence for Alexander's career comes from secondary citations by Arrian, Diodorus, and Strabo of the historical works composed by the contemporaries of Alexander, including Callisthenes, Nearchus, Ptolemy I Soter, Aristobulus, and Cleitarchus. For a general discussion of these primary sources, see, for instance, Lionel I. C. Person, The Lost Histories of Alexander the Great (PM 20; New York: American Philological Associasion, 1960); Nicholas G. L. Hammond, Three Historians of Alexander the the Great: The so-called Vulgate Authors, Diodorus, Justin and Curtius (CCS; Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1983); idem., Sources for Alexander the Great: An Analysis of Plutarch's life life and Anion's Anabasis Alexandrou (CCS; Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1993); Albert B. Bosworth, From Arrian to Alexander: Studies in Historical Interpretation (Oxford: Clarendon, 1988). For a comprehensive, but somewhat outdated, bibliography, see Jacob Seibert, Alexander der Grosse (ErFor 10; Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1972). 19 D. R. Schwarz has suggested that Josephus's phrase "now about this time" is actu ally a specific literary marker used by Josephus to indicate that the marked material was copied from an auxiliary source ("Κατά Τούτον Τον Καιρόν: Josephus' Source on Agrippa II," JQR 72 [1982] 241-68, 246). 20 James C. VanderKam, The Second Temple High Priesthood (Minneapolis: Fortress, forthcoming).</page><page sequence="12">436 TAE HUN KIM Mesopotamia. He won a decisive victory in Gaugamela (October 1st 331 b.c.e.) and thereby effectively destroyed the Persian empire. Josephus, however, abruptly ends his treatment of Alexander after recording Alexander's visit to Shechem and his plan to go down to Egypt {Ant. 11.345). Then Ant. 11.346 begins after the death of Alexander (323 b.c.e.),b.c.e.), when the division of his empire among the four generals was already completed. The first contact between Alexander and Jaddua occurs at the begin ning of the siege of Tyre. Alexander made an attempt to court the "friendship" of the Jews and to induce them to abandon the Persians that Jaddua would never regret the friendship of the Macedonians (Ant. 11.317). This gave Jaddua a window of opportunity to establish a favor able relationship with Alexander by assisting him before his hegemony in Asia was fully secured. By wisdom or folly, however, Jaddua refused to take a chance with this Macedonian upstart and maintained his alle giance to the rapidly deteriorating Persian empire. Alexander's initial anger against the Jews is thus not without justification {Ant. 11.318-19). The Jewish disobedience is further contrasted with the Samaritan com pliance, as Sanballat personally visited Alexander with eight thousand Samaritan troops and pledged their allegiance to the Macedonian cause {Ant.{Ant. 11.321-22). But Alexander did not take any action against the Jews just yet, and Josephus's presentation of Alexander does not make him particularly hostile to the Jews. Only after the capture of Gaza does Alexander make haste to go up to Jerusalem {Ant. 11.325, 330). Thus the stage is set for the advent of Alexander. The sequence of the historical narrative encapsulating Alexander's dream story has already been summarized earlier.21 The actual text of Alexander's dream story reads as follows: (333) But Parmenion22 alone went up to [Alexander] and asked why when all prostrated themselves before him should he prostrate himself to the high priest of the Jews? "Not to him," he said, "did I prostrate myself but to the God who has honored him with the high priesthood. (334) For I saw this very person in a dream, in this very appearance, when I was at Dios, in Macedonia. When I was considering to myself how I mip-ht nrornre the dominion nf Asia, he enconraired me not to hold hack 21 See the Introduction of this paper. 22 The choice of Parmenion as the questioner is rather interesting. He was one of the most able generals of Philip II and several decades senior to Alexander. He thus commanded much respect in the court of Alexander, and was probably the best per son to put questions to Alexander when no one else would have dared. Parmenion was</page><page sequence="13">THE DREAM OF ALEXANDER IN JOSEPHUS 437 but to set out with courage, for he would lead my army and give me the supremacy over the Persians. (335) Wherever he is from, I had not seen anyone in that appearance, but now when I saw this person, it has reminded me of the vision in the sleep and the exhortation. I (thus) believe that I lead this army under the divine leadership, and therefore shall con quer Darius, and destroy the power of the Persians, and that everything will proceed in accordance with my design."23 From a literary point of view, a number of characteristic features emerge from this story. (1) Alexander saw the dream three years earlier while he was still in Dios, Macedonia and worrying about how to implement his ambitions of conquest. This dream does not mention the future siege of Jerusalem but only addresses the immediate concerns of Alexander. (2) The dream of Alexander occurred without his initiative. Alexander was not trying to incubate in order to receive a divinely inspired dream to ascertain the fate of his planned conquest. (3) Jaddua appeared in the full high priestly garb but essentially remained anony mous as Alexander did not recognize the sacred attire. But the full high priestly garb with the blue and gold robe and a miter with a golden plate, upon which the name of the Lord was engraved, must have been sufficiendy impressive for Alexander to take the dream and the utterance of Jaddua seriously. (4) Jaddua exhorted Alexander not to delay the conquest and encouraged him to go boldly across the Hellespont. "He"24 would provide guidance for his army and give dominion over the Persians. This, I believe, is the most remarkable aspect of Alexander's dream. Alexander at that point must have been deeply concerned with the enormity of the task he intended to under take: the conquest of the Persian empire. Alexander's dream, therefore, is specific to the issues he had while in Macedonia and resolves them by providing divine assurance of success for his plan. Therefore, this dream functions as a confirmation of Alexander's design and like an oracle responds to his particular concerns. effectively the second in command in every major battle Alexander fought, but a difference of opinion concerning the extent of Alexander's conquest plan slowly devel oped into a rift between them. He was more cautious and conservative, while Alexander was thoroughly expansionistic. Finally Alexander had him murdered in 330 b.c.e., shortly after Parmenion's son had been executed for an allegation of treason. 23 This translation is the author's own. 24 It is ambiguous to whom this pronoun "he" refers, as it could be either Jaddua himself or God. Although it seems more likely to refer to Jaddua himself in the con text of the dream story, Alexander obviously knew that Jaddua was not divine himself but a representative of God.</page><page sequence="14">438 TAE HUN KIM 3.2 Other models for Alexander's dream narrative In this section we will discuss a number of apparent discrepancies between Cohen's model of the soteriological epiphany and Alexander's dream story. First, Alexander's dream narrative, when considered separately, func tions to legitimize Alexander's conquest by providing a divinely sane tioned guarantee for success. It is not in any way related to any kind of saving activity, which would be expected in a soteriological epiphany. Furthermore, this dream story does not cast Alexander as an aggres sive villain but as someone who is worthy of divine protection and guidance. As the dream was unsolicited, in that Alexander did not seek the divine opinion about his plan of conquest, the fact that he received a personal visitation from God with the assurance of success elevates the stature of Alexander, as it is a display of extraordinary divine favor. This aspect of the story resonates with the story of Xerxes' dreams in Herodotus, though in a complete reversal of the logic. Second, in the immediate context of the Alexander-Jaddua story, Alexander's dream narrative functions as a propaganda piece for Jaddua and the high priesthood. When Alexander first saw Jaddua in his full high priestly garb, Alexander approached Jaddua alone and prostrated himself before him, paying reverence to the name of God engraved upon the plate on Jaddua's miter. This was done in view of everyone who had accompanied Alexander; they were dumbfounded by this sight—the king of Asia (at the time) who was aspiring to the domin ion of the entire world bowed before a priest of an obscure local deity. Alexander's dream story provides the rationale for this inexplicable behavior, since he recognized Jaddua as the dream figure and believed that his present success was owed to the guidance of the God Jaddua served. This story thus invented a crucial role for the Jewish religion in the course of world history: the conquest of Alexander was made possible only under the auspices of YHWH. There are also many leg ends that report signs of divine favor and promises of greatness given to Alexander, as the local deities of territory that newly came under his rule seemed eager to cultivate his favor. The religious policy of Alexander was exceptionally tolerant of various religious practices, and Alexander did visit a number of major temples and shrines to pay his respects.25 Therefore, what he reportedly did in the Alexander-Jaddua 25 Alexander styled himself as a son of Heracles, and Zeus after the victory at</page><page sequence="15">THE DREAM OF ALEXANDER IN JOSEPHUS 439 episode conforms to Alexander's known religious policy.26 However, the Alexander-Jaddua episode differs from other legends of divine favor, as it ultimately seeks to praise and elevate the Jewish religion and the Jews rather than Alexander. This point is again consistent with Catulus' dreams about Augustus. Third, some scholars have argued that the dream narratives of Alexander and Jaddua should be considered a prime example of a "double dream," two dreams received by two people that verify the message by virtue of their striking similarity.27 However, I am not con vinced that this is the case, as this model is applicable only when both dreams are similar in structure and origin. The dreams were given in different times (the three-year gap), under different circumstances (un solicited versus active incubation), and in different venues (Dion in Macedonian versus the Jerusalem temple). Also, there is little similar ity in the manner in which the dreams were given. Alexander's dream is clearly of the audio-visual type, which seems' to exhibit a close affinity to the Greek pattern of dream stories. But Jaddua's dream seems to be of the auditory message type, in which no visual symbol is given. This auditory message type is prevalent in the OT and may have been influenced by it. (3) Alexander and Jaddua did not dream about each other, and the dreams do not convey a consistent message. Alexander did see Jaddua in the dream, but Jaddua's appearance had only a lim ited function in the dream, as he did not recognize who Jaddua was. The message of the dream mentions nothing about the Jews. Jaddua's dream is about Alexander's arrival, not about Alexander himself. Therefore, it is difficult to accept that the dreams of Alexander and Jaddua are a prime example of a "double-dream." Their dreams were different in form yet were tied to a similar thematic function by the force of the larger narrative, which gave rise to the illusion of a "double dream" in this context. In my opinion, such a literary practice would not make the dreams of Alexander and Jaddua a "double-dream." The overall structure of the Alexander-Jaddua story thus has become more diverse, as now there appears to be three related but formally divergent components in the larger story: the actual welcoming cere Gaugamela. After visiting the oracle of Ammon, he then styled himself as a son of Zeus Ammon. 26 VanderKam, The Second Temple High Priesthood, forthcoming. 27 Gnusen, Dream Reports, 241; Wikenhauser, "Doppeltraume," 100-11; Hanson, "Dreams," 1414-19.</page><page sequence="16">440 TAE HUN KIM mony for Alexander and the subsequent acts of respect and benevo lence (the adventus story); the dream ofjaddua (the epiphany story); the dream of Alexander (the divine legitimization). This model shows a greater degree of editorial skill on the part of Josephus as he inte grated these various elements into a one coherent narrative. This model also demonstrates that the dream stories of Alexander and Jaddua do not belong to the same literary category, and thus it seems incorrect to identify them as a case of "double dream." 4. Conclusion The story of the meeting of Alexander the Great and Jaddua the high priest in Ant. 11.325-39 is more complicated than it seemed ini tially. The literary definition of epiphany story as suggested by Cohen seems inadequate to explain Alexander's dream narrative fully. Cohen's classification of Alexander's dream narrative as an epiphany story relies heavily upon how Alexander's dream narrative is used in the larger context of Alexander-Jaddua meeting, where the dream story is in fact used to resolve the tension between Alexander and Jaddua, thereby providing a solution, i.e., rescue for the Jews. However, when consid ered separately, the theme and content of Alexander's dream narra tive itself are obviously not soteriological but a propagandistic divine legitimization of his conquest. There is no element of saving act in the content and the message of the dream. It is how the dream is used in the context of Alexander-Jaddua story that makes this dream function soteriologically, by providing the rationale for the dramatic resolution of the tension. Therefore, defining Alexander's dream narrative in terms of other Greek soteriological epiphany stories does not seem to do jus tice to the evidence we have, and there is even less evidence to sup pose that the two dreams stories of Alexander and Jaddua were originally a single soteriological epiphany story. It also seems ultimately unfruit ful to try to reconstruct the "original dream story" of Alexander in accordance with the common features of other epiphany stories.28 Rather, it seems more plausible that Alexander's dream narrative contains themes and elements that cannot be wholly explained by the epiphany story. 28 Cohen also agrees that a reconstruction of the original dream story is futile; he nevertheless makes a partial attempt ("Alexander," 45 n. 8).</page><page sequence="17">THE DREAM OF ALEXANDER IN JOSEPHUS 441 As we have seen so far, the thematic structure of the Alexander Jaddua story is quite complex, and any attempt to separate the story into smaller subunits must proceed with caution. Cohen basically con cedes that any literary analysis of the Alexander-Jaddua story has to be tentative, as the episode is a complex amalgam of motifs.29 But he does not hesitate to present his models of adventus and epiphany sto ries as the correct archetypes behind these substories. Serious problems emerge when he uses these models to construct an argument for mul tiple separate sources of Josephus's account, for which there is little evidence. Although the tenor of the Alexander-Jaddua story is admit tedly glorifying and propagandistic for the Jewish high priesthood and the Jewish nation in general, there are a number of elements that seem to cohere with the known historical facts from the life of Alexander. The various elements of the meeting of Alexander and Jaddua, the adventus story and the respective dream stories, are very well inte grated into the larger narrative, so much that it seems very difficult to separate the underlying subunits without doing injustice to the over arching structure of the larger narrative. Furthermore, the conclusions drawn from this study urge one to revisit the question of the historical authenticity of the Alexander-Jaddua episode. In terms of historical verisimilitude most historians agree that the story of Alexander and Jaddua is a historical myth created to exalt the Jews, primarily due to the fact that Josephus is the only known witness to this event.30 In terms of literary analysis the dominating scholarly opinion seems heavily dependent upon Cohen's conclusions and rejects the historical authenticity of this episode as an amalgam of multiple narratives. However, Cohen's two-fold analysis of the dream stories now seems inadequate to explain the various elements in this episode fully, as the dream stories in the Alexander-Jaddua episode are more diverse in nature yet structured in a very cohesive manner to advance the propagandistic goal of the story. It seems more plausible, therefore, to consider the Alexander-Jaddua episode as a single coher ent literary piece rather than a heavily edited patchwork of different types of narratives. This conclusion in itself makes no immediate judg 29 "Alexander," 44. 30 See, for instance, Cohen, "Alexander," 66-68; Victor Tcherikover, Hellenistic Civilization and and the Jews (repr.; Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson, 1999), 45-49; Joseph Blenkinsopp, A History History of Prophecy in Israel (rev. ed.; Louisville, Ky.: Westminster, 1996), 231, 279 n. 55; Martin Hengel, Jews, Greeks and Barbarians: Aspects of the Hellenization of Judaism in the Pre Christian Period (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1980), 6-7.</page><page sequence="18">442 TAE HUN KIM ment on the question of historical authenticity, but it seems sufficiently plausible to reopen the debate as far as the literary analysis of the episode is concerned. Consequently, any argument against the authen ticity of the Alexander-Jaddua episode based on Cohen's classification of dream story types may benefit from a thorough reassessment.</page></plain_text>
