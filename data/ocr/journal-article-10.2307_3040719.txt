<plain_text><page sequence="1">KURT WEINBERG Nietzsche's Paradox of Tragedy* Only as esthetic phenomena are existence and the universe forever justified. -Nietzsche * For Nietzsche, convention "is the condition of art, not its hindrance" (III 754), and tragedy, in particular, is predicated upon the most basic of human conventions: upon language, both as verbal expression and ges- ture. Not in a confused laisser aller does the classical dramatist attain his ends but rather by rigidly controlling "invention"-in the tradi- tional sense: the "finding" of, the "coming upon" striking images, rhythms, sound and rhyme patterns within the narrow confines of tra- ditional plots, metric forms, and genres. His freedom resides in con- traintes, in his ability to "dance in fetters," to vanquish self-made difficulties while covering them up with "the deception of facility" (I 932 [? 140]). In so doing, he conforms in his own way to the same rules of artistic artificality which govern the acting of the dummy-like hero of Greek tragedy (or the stylized protagonist of French classical drama). All art is serious play and as such is stylization: in the strict- est meaning play-acting, per-forming, representing; in short, histri- onics or hypocrisy (literally, the "playing of a part," Greek hypo- crisis). Hypocrisy, mimicry, an unconscious but infinitely artful cunning is the very law by which organic life seduces, for the sake of its own re- *From Yale French Studies 38 (May 1967): The Classical Line: Essays in Honor of Henri Peyre. * *Quotations, if not otherwise indicated, refer to the three volume edition of Nietzsche's Werke, edited by Karl Schlechta, Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich (1954-1956) which, although not complete, offers the advantage of not having been bowdlerized by Frau Elisabeth F6rster-Nietzsche.

In this sense, the psychology of Nietzsche's Dionysian ideal of the actor-the polar opposite of the nineteenth-century artist who, in his schizophrenia, vicariously acts out his own fantasies in the charac- ters of his novels and plays ("Madame Bovary, c'est moi! ")-provides an insight into the physiology of deception, the sprezzatura, one might say, by which all organisms seem to plot the triumph of the strongest individuals over the mediocrity of their race. The paradox of art as a sexual device of Nature, the procreative and fertilizing stimulus provoked by enticing colors, perfumes, sounds, and rhythmic movement as organic functions of plant and animal life demon~strate to what an extent beauty as dissimulation, as play-acting, as hypocrisy, reaches far beyond man and human consciousness: "Dis- simulation increases, according to the ascending hierarchy of living things.... It seems to be absent from anorganic Nature: [there] power [is pitched] against power, quite crudely so-ruse begins with the world of organic beings; already plants are masters of ruse.... Cunning mul- tiplied a thousand times belongs to the essence of man's rise ... prob- lem of the actor, my Dion~Eos-ideal . . ." (III 578). One and the same type of energy or "will to power," a physiological and psychological drive for intoxication, blindly animates and metamorphoses all living things. It attains its goals by devious means, by sham and deception. From plant to animal and man, all sexual activity takes place through a triumph of art. Not Nature but productive and sexual fantasies, set in motion by the illusion of beauty, lead to procreation as well as to the creation of works of art. In man's unique case, "it is one and the same energy that is spent in the conception of art and in the sex act" (111 924). For the very existence of art, "one physiological preliminary is indis- pensable: intoxication," and "above all the intoxication of sexual ex- citement, great cupidity, strong emotions." Idealization is no more than "a rape of things, a manner of forcing the dominant features into the open by way of that intoxication which is a feeling of increased energy and exuberance" (II 995 [?8]). The artist's creative instinct is closely related to "the distribution of semen in his blood" (III 870). An inquiry into his psychology would involve a critique of his play instinct as "a pouring out of energy, the enjoyment of change" and of willful transformation, a curious pleasure taken in "impressing one's own soul upon foreign matter," the artist's boundless selfishness, the kind of "in- stincts he sublimates" (III 867). Intoxication as a phallic experience constitutes the heightened feeling of power which brings about artis-</page><page sequence="3">88 Yale French Studies tic creation: it is that inner need which drives the artist, "to make of things reflexes of his own perfection" (II 995 [?9]). Against the esthetics of "disinterested contemplation, by means of which the emasculation of art tries today . .. to give itself a clean con- science" (11 598 [?33]), against Kant's and Schopenhauer's assertion that the contemplation of art neutralizes sexual desires, Nietzsche suggests that Stendhal comes closer to the truth with his contention that art is "a promise of happiness." All theorists of art, from Aristotle to Schopenhauer, have failed to see the essential aspects of the esthetic experience, because, rather than envisaging art from the creative artist's viewpoint, they have always looked at it from the spectator's perspective. Nietzsche, turning to the psychology of the artist, points bluntly to the myth of Pygmalion (II 845 ff. [?6]) as a key to the under- standing of the motives behind artistic creation: Far from being disin- terested, the creative instinct takes its impetus from a heightening of sensual appetites and a state of intoxication. With "the divine Plato," Nietzsche upholds that "all beauty excites the procreative powers: this precisely is its property, from the most sensual to the most intellectual and spiritual" things on the ladder of being (II 1003 [?22]). The desire for art and beauty "is an indirect longing for sexual thrills which the procreative instinct communicates to the cerebrum" (III 870). Just as situations which are transfigured and enhanced by our sexual and emo- tional fantasies will reflect our own vitality, so, inversely, if we come into contact with objects which rank high on our personal scale of sen- sual values and which, accordingly, show "this sort of transfiguration and enhancement, then our animal existence responds with an excite- ment of those spheres where such states of pleasure are imbedded-and a mixture of these very delicate dispositions for animal enjoyments and desires is the esthetic condition" (III 535; cf. II 995 [?8]; III 755). It can only be found in persons who are endowed with an excess of "procre- ative vigor" in which "always inheres the primum mobile" (ibid.). In short, as Freud himself acknowledges it, the Freudian concept of "sub- limation" preexists in Nietzsche's psychology of the esthetic experi- ence, and so does the word itself: It originates in Human, All Too Hu- man (1879), with Nietzsche's realization that "there is no unselfish action, nor is there such a thing as disinterested contemplation: both are but sublimations . . ." (I 447 [? 1]). The creative act overpowers the artist, turning him into its mere tool: The paternal, patterning "Apol- lonian" and the maternal, matter-providing "Dionysian" (cf. Aristotle, On the generation of animals) take possession and dispose of him with</page><page sequence="4">KURT WEINBERG 89 the violence of natural forces majeures, "whether he is willing or not: compelling him, on one hand, to become a visionary, on the other, to orgy. Both conditions are present in normal life too, only more weakly; as dream and intoxication" (III 788). These latter, too, "unleash in us artistic powers which are at variance: dream releasing the power to see, to connect things in logical sequence, to create poetry; intoxication en- dowing us with the gift of mimicry, passion, song, dance" (ibid.). Rim- baud in 1871, and Nietzsche in 1872, independent from one another, enounce the same truth about the lyrical poet as a quasi passive in- strument, a voice and mime ("Je est un autre") in the hands, as it were, of a creative power that works through him (Rimbaud to P. Demeny, May 15, 1871, and The Birth of Tragedy I 38,1 40 [?5]). "All perfect doing, to be exact, takes place unconsciously and is not willed" (III 746). For Nietzsche, the will to power is "not a being, not a becoming, but a pathos-the most elemental fact to begin with, from which as a consequence 'becoming' and 'producing' result" (III 778). Since pathos, passion, implies passivity, a suffering, in a way a mater- nal state, the difference between "committing" one's actions and "en- during" them as they arise spontaneously from the blind "will to power" is, to say the least, negligible. In Nietzsche's world, where con- sciousness falsifies all values by rationalizing them, and where the in- dividual never senses the true role he plays within the overall plans of the species, one does not "do": one is "being done, at every instant! Mankind has at all times confused the active and the passive: that hap- pens to be its eternal grammatical blunder" (I 1096 [?121]). Wherever our ignorance begins and our vision is blocked, we "place a word, e.g. the word 'I,' the word 'do,' the word 'suffer': those, perhaps, are the hori- zons of our knowledge, but they are no 'truths' " (III 863). In the very separation of the concept of "action" from that of "suffering," Nietz- sche sees a misunderstanding which is rooted in language itself, and hence in consciousness: Language and thought, in their stumbling manner, can only proceed by way of "distinctions," and only distin- guish or categorize by positing "pairs of opposites" where, in truth, seeming opposites occur organically intermingled as a complex and, as it were, hermaphroditic unity. "Acting" and "suffering" are simulta- neously present in artistic creation, in the Apollonian-Dionysian po- larity and duplicity of poiein-for Nietzsche (the classical philologist) not merely a "making," but as in Hesiod a "bringing into existence" (Works and Days 1 10; Theogony 161, 579 etc.), in Andocides a "beget- ting" (1.124; 4.22), and in Plato literally a "conceiving" of children</page><page sequence="5">90 Yale French Studies (Symposium 203b). Artistic creation wholly depends on a sexual stim- ulation which, in the final analysis, is identified by Nietzsche as an ex- cess of procreative strength, an overflowing and sublimation of the will to power: "Without a certain overheating of the sexual system, a Raf- fael is unthinkable," and "music making, too, is a way of making chil- dren" (III 756). Nietzsche's erotic concept of poetry (in the broadest sense, as a "making of works") affords remarkable insights into the psychology and physiology of the artist as "the maternal type of man" (II 251 [?376]), who is "constantly pregnant" (II 243 [?369]), and far beyond that, on the cosmic level, into the self-creating nature of "the universe as a work of art giving birth to itself " (111 495). The problem which, from the outset, intrigues Nietzsche, in retrospect is formulated by him in these terms: "How far does art reach into the innermost recesses of the world? And do there exist, apart from the 'artist,' other artistic pow- ers?" To the second question, he unhesitatingly answers "yes." As to the first, he elaborates: "The world is nothing else but art!" And once more he passionately affirms the superiority of art over philosophy: "There is something contrary to nature in wisdom that is revealed by its hostility to art: to ask for knowledge where illusion alone gives de- liverance, salvation-this indeed is perversion, the instinct for noth- ingness!" (Musarion-Ausgabe XIV 324): words which echo the major thesis of The Birth of Tragedy and "The Pathos of Truth," one of five prefaces for unwritten books presented in 1872 as Christmas gifts to Cosima Wagner: "Art is mightier than cognition, for it wills life, and cognition attains as its ultimate goal-destruction" (III 271). Aisthesis, sense perception, establishes the link between art and science; it facilitates the understanding of the artful workings of the or- ganic and the anorganic world. Like artistic production and recep- tivity for art, all worthwhile knowledge is fully dependent on the sub- tlety, vigor, and alertness of the senses: "Today our science reaches exactly as far as our determination to accept the testimony 6f our senses" (II 958 [?3]). To be meaningful at all, the "realm of concepts" cannot be absolutely severed from "the world of the senses"; nor can the identity of "being" and "thinking" be abolished (III 394 [?13]). In the final analysis, all true cognition-in its anthropomorphic relativ- ity-amounts to no more (and no less) than an esthetic experience: It cannot transcend the organic prison walls of the human senses. To the mind of the Ancients, the esthetic experience rated above all other forms of knowledge. The sense of taste in particular, as the most sub-</page><page sequence="6">KURT WEINBERG 91 tle tool of touch and testing, for them was so closely related to the idea of "wisdom" that "the Greek word which designates the sage ety- mologically belongs to sapio I taste, sapiens the one who is tasting, sisyphos the man with the keenest taste; an acute feeling out through tasting, a significant aptitude for distinguo by the palate: this was the specific art of the philosopher, such as popular consciousness saw it" (III 363f. [?3]). Where taste, sensuality, wisdom, and knowledge are said to be interrelated, esthetics has clearly conquered the epistemological scene, and the object of its inquiry, no matter what the domain, will be art, that very force which, for Nietzsche, in all organisms stimulates life and excites its reproduction: "Art and nothing else but art! Art is that great power which alone makes life possible, the great seducer of life, the great stimulus for life" (1III 692 [?2]). Wherever art, i.e. the will to power, commands, it works through "agents" that only "act out" whatever it wills while they are under the impression that they are act- ing of their own accord, at their own discretion. Psychologically seen, "the concept of cause is the sensation of power we experience in the exercise of our so-called [free] 'will';-our notion effect, the supersti- tion that this feeling of power is the power itself which moves. . . " (III 775). When, as in Nietzsche's thought, the entire universe determines like an organism the functions of even the smallest of its parts by the animating and destructive force of a blind will to power, haphazardly, and without the benefit of a guiding Hegelian Weltgeist (that obligingly would become conscious of itself in the cataclysms of "world"-i.e. "human"-history) then there can be no such things as "moral" or "immoral" acts; then "free" and "spontaneous intentions" and the concept of "action" itself must needs be relegated to the world of imag- ination and fiction (III 612). In such a scheme, nothing would remain of the mystery of the universe but the dual and pulsating lust and rhythm of a permanent self-creation and self-destruction in great things and small, a constant metamorphosis of the "actor," the mask, while the play and the role would essentially stay the same in the eternal return of the life cycle. On the largest scale, the universe itself would per- form in eternal repetitions (and rehearsals) the parts of Nietzsche's Dionysian actor: "Dionysian universe of eternal self-creation, eternal self-destruction ... This world is the will to power and nothing else! And you are yourselves that will to power-and nothing else! " (III 917). Life, in all its manifestations, would then be one infinite and eter- nal pathos-a suffering, a fate, a moira-personifying itself in count- less "actors" on all ranks of its hierarchy. The theatre, as a dark mirror</page><page sequence="7">92 Yale French Studies to life, would then show the tragic hero as a sufferer at the hands of a power that wills and acts through him, and over which he exercises practically no control whatsoever. A determinist view of this magni- tude, organic rather than mechanistic, would also lead to an idea of the "drama" and to a "poetics" in some ways different from Aristotle's. It is then not surprising that Nietzsche should deplore what he considers to be one among a number of errors in Aristotle's rather insensitive in- terpretation of the nature of "drama" in general, and of the tragic hero in particular. A casual footnote in The Wagner Case (11 921 [?9]), in fact, calls into question the Aristotelian views on tragedy, pointing out that the Doric word drama by no means designated "action"; instead, it meant a hieratic event, a sacred "story": The oldest drama enacted the holy legend on which the local religious cult was founded. Substance is lent to Nietzsche's hypothesis by more recent commentaries on the extended Attic form of "drama," dramosyne "sacred service" (cf. Frisk I 416), "ceremony" (Inscriptiones Graecae 112 1358 ii 34, 40: IVth century B.C.). Aristotle himself explains that Doric dran, the root of "drama," meant the same as Attic prattein (i.e., "to go through," only later "to achieve," "to accomplish," "to effect," etc.) (Poetics 3.6). Nietzsche suggests that by mistranslating dran as a doing, the German classical philologists-who, ever since Wilamowitz-Mbllendorff 's vi- olent attacks on The Birth of Tragedy ( "Zukunftsphilologie! ") have ob- served a hostile silence-are guilty of spreading misconceptions on the character of tragedy. What Nietzsche seems to imply is that dran and prattein alike express a "bringing about," an "effecting" which is its own end and has no moral connotations: It turns the subject through whom it works into a sufferer, not into a "free" agent. Instead of spon- taneously acting, the tragic hero in the end recognizes that he is and has been no more than a plaything in the hands of a fate to which he consents (amor fati), and which coincides with those uncontrollable forces that through his immolation, his consciously accepted sacrifice, fulfill themselves. Here again, Nietzsche's contention seemsito be borne out by the derivatives of prattein: praxis, the mythological event (and not action) which according to Aristotle (Poetics 6.8), rather than the hero's character, is to be acted out through the hero's persona; pragma (pl. pragmata) misleadingly translated as actus, "act(s)"-in the language of the theatre: the principal divisions of the play (in Latin, originally, the role of the actor), means primarily "events," "circum- stances," i.e. happenings rather than actions (cf. Herodotos 1.207; Thucydides 1.89; 3.82); while in Euripides' Helena (286), pragmasin</page><page sequence="8">KURT WEINBERG 93 "by circumstances" is expressly contrasted with ergoisi "by acts." Whatever the merits of Nietzsche's reinterpretation of the concept of "drama," he makes short shrift of the meaning which, since the Re- naissance, classical scholars have read into the Aristotelian idea of mimesis as the purported "imitation of an action," for he sees in it the representation of suffering, passion, pathos (pl. pathe), which befall the hero by a fatality that he cannot escape, and against his conscious will. Thus Nietzsche resolves in an ironic and tragic coincidentia opposito- rum the age-honoured antinomies of praxis "action," pathos "inci- dent," "accident," "chance," and pathe "suffering," "misfortune." He can conclude: "Tragedy had in mind great pathos scenes-action, as it were, was precluded from it ([in time] situated before the beginning and [in space] behind the scene") (II 921 [?9])-words which could stand as a gloss to Boileau's: Ce qu'on ne doit point voir, qu'un recit nous l'ex- pose (Art poetique 3, 51)-but which ultimately touch upon what Nietzsche considers as the essence of tragedy: Those poignant pathos scenes (Aristotle, Poetics 14, 9) where the tragic hero, suffering from an excess of tensions which explode into "action," moves toward his doom without consciously becoming a "culprit," a "sinner." This idea, a major theme, a leitmotif, the esthetic foundation un- derlying Nietzsche's entire work, is expressed as early as 1864 in the student essay Primum Oedipodis regis carmen choricum: "The Greeks thought differently from us about the tragic effect; it was brought about by way of the great pathos scenes .. . where action meant little but lyri- cism everything. . . " (HKGA, Werke 11 3 75). With the exception of the seventeenth-century French, no modern playwright has understood what Nietzsche elsewhere (and without reference to the French) calls "the awesome Gorgon-head beauty of the Classical" (111 159), which de- stroys the tragic hero without "adequately" relating his misfortune to any "guilt"-for there is such a thing as "pure, innocent misfortune" ( 1065 [?78]). Christianity, in particular in its Northern manifestations where it has lost contact with its Mediterranean origins, has falsified all psychological values: it has abolished the innocence of suffering by causally linking it with the concepts of "sin," "justice," "punish- ment"; it has branded as "sinful," "suspect," and "seductive" all great emotions of overflowing lust and strength, such as haughtiness, pride, voluptuousness, triumph, self-assurance, temerity, self-love; it has sanctified meekness and made it desirable; it has distorted the meaning of love by interpreting it as altruism and, in doing so, de-</page><page sequence="9">94 Yale French Studies manded unselfishness, the forsaking of the "self," the "ego," its alter- ation (the true significance of "altruism"); it has made a punishment of life itself, a temptation of fortune; it has condemned the passions as diabolical, man's trust in himself as godlessness. Christian psychol- ogy, as Nietzsche sees it, is a psychology of inhibition, a walling-in against life-out of fear of life's tragic sense (III 519 f.). "The doctrine of [the free] will was, on the whole, invented for the purpose of pun- ishment" (II 976 [?7]; III 822). Against the Christian exorcism of hu- man passions by the frail dogma of the "free will," Nietzsche's depth psychology affords abysmal insights into the blind "will to power" which is impersonal and disposes of the individual, allowing-if one accepts these premises-equally terrifying apprehensions about the obscure forces which drive certain Cornelian and Racinian heroes to their orgies of destruction and self-immolation. For Nietzsche asks questions such as: "whether all conscious willing, all conscious aims, all valuations are not mere means by which something essentially dif- ferent must be effected than what might appear within consciousness " (III 901). Man is at the same time much more and much less than an individual; it is impossible for him "not to be possessed by the quali- ties and preferences of his parents and ancestors . . . Provided that something is known about the parents, a conclusion is permissible as to the child" (II 738 [?264]). No traits of character, however small, are insignificant. Nor do they occur as a matter of chance. Everything in a "personality" obeys the iron law of an ineluctable determinism which organically extends into the past and into the future of mankind. "On the whole, everything is worth exactly as much as one has paid for it. . . 'Heredity' is an erroneous notion. For what someone is, his ancestors have paid the price" (111 552). If one applies Nietzsche's views to French classical tragedy, even such monsters of "will power" as Corneille's Horace, Polyeucte, Auguste, and Attila appear to be guided by an instinctive "will to power" prepared by the preceding generations: their generosity, their sense of honor, their terribilitas, their religious or political fervour then seem no longer matters of choice but predestined, the unique and only form which their in- escapable fate can take. They represent rare culminating points where mankind, after decades or centuries of blind elaboration, produces its healthiest and strongest exemplars in whom it attains perfection: the end toward which in ever returning cycles the human race moves in its tireless and unconscious efforts to overcome itself. And yet, they are nothing more than incarnations of Nietzsche's Dionysian actor</page><page sequence="10">KURT WEINBERG 95 who consents to a tragic fate over which he has no control and which is acting through his mask, his persona, his person. There is no escape for the individual from the fatal chain of mankind; "every human being is himself a piece of fate" (I 905 [?61]). Inexorably, Nietzsche demonstrates the utter vanity of everyone else's and his own attempts to break through the prison walls of fate and to seek his personal salvation: "You are yourself that invincible moira; in you the entire future of the human world is predestined; little does it avail you if you shrink from yourself in horror" (ibid.). From the low- est cell to the universe itself, all existence suffers the will to power, in the final analysis, a permanence of tensions and of constant changes. On the cosmic scale: "The world subsists, without becoming, without perishing. Or rather: it is becoming, it is perishing, but without ever having begun to become or ended perishing-it persists in both condi- tions ... It feeds on itself: its excrements are its nourishment" (III 703). On the human scale: the same cycle; in the strongest exemplars, in the type of the tragic hero, a frail balance: a tension of power quanta, each striving for greater intensity, for usurpation; all competing with each other, and producing in the subject a rapid change, a pendulum move- ment of violent passions, an imperious desire for the total possession or (if this should prove impossible) for the total destruction of the coveted object; in other terms, an insatiable appetite for an absolute ascendency which, feeding on itself, corresponds to a maximum of pleasure or a maximum of repugnance, but which is not identical to a platitudinous, plebeian, Darwinian "instinct of self-preservation," nor to a sense of "order" or to a devotion to "lawfulness." Racine's Pyrrhus, Hermione, Neron, Agrippine, Roxane, Athalie (among others) do not pursue "happiness" but absolute power over the objects of their persecution, in a spirit of total and passionate commit- ment, at the risk of their own immolation, and as prisoners tied to the pendulum swing of their alternating emotions. In so doing, they blindly obey their chameleon-like instincts, "they change, but they do not evolve" (to use Nietzsche's terms which, however, do not specifically refer to Racine's characters) (III 725). "Every instinct is a type of despo- tism" and establishes its "own perspective" (111 903; cf. 11 571 [?6]), and since "all instincts are unintelligent, " no instinct proceeds from a util- itarian viewpoint (III 909). The life of the instincts is explained by Nietzsche as "a structure and a branching out" of that basic and thor- oughly subconscious form of will, the will to power, whose commands are promptly rationalized by consciousness: "To the strongest of our</page><page sequence="11">96 Yale French Studies instincts, to the tyrant in us, submits not only our reasoning but also our conscience" (II 638 [? 158]). When all is said, the conscious exercise of our will amounts to a delusion, a rationalization of dark instinctive forces which dispose of us on all levels of our being. Whatever we may take for our "activity" is at heart only something that comes to pass by way of our existence, and that we are fated to do. It is no more than a passing, a passion that we undergo; both literally, a happening, and etymologically (German: Geschehen "event," Geschick "fate," Geschichte "history"-all stem- ming from the same root), an event that by fate and historically is bound to come into being through and by our existence: paradoxically, an "act" of ours that we must suffer to be performed by us. Man is what he is by a higher and innate necessity, and to speak of him "as he ought to be is as absurd as: a tree as it ought to be" (III 671). In this sense, every human being is a unique and prodigious phenome- non (I 287 [?1]); and yet, he but exists as a necessary link in a sequence, "concretized out of the elements and influences of things past and pres- ent ... He cannot be held responsible: neither for what he is, nor for his motives, nor for his actions, nor for their effects" (I 479f. [?39]). The en- tire history of the human emotions amounts to "the history of an er- ror, the error of responsibility which rests upon the error of the freedom of the will" (ibid.). Nietzsche never tires of repeating that man is to- tally without responsibility for his actions and innocent of their con- sequences (I 513 [?107]; I 544 [?144]; I 709 [?588]; I 908 [?69]; I 912f. [?81]; etc.). The doctrine of responsibility is founded on the naive as- sumption that "only the will can be causal, and that a person must know that he actually willed in order to be entitled to believe in him- self as a cause" (III 745). We are as little responsible for the things we do while we are awake as we are for our dreams (I 1098f. [?128]). If for Fr. Schlegel "the historian is a prophet turned backwards" (Athenaeums-Fragmente), for Nietzsche (as for the Ancients), the past is like the voice of the Pythia, darkly but infallibly forebodingthe fu- ture: "The judgment of the past is always an oracular response" (I 251 [?6]). In this manner, the fatality incarnate in Racine's Phedre, as well as her guiltlessness for the persecution she suffers at the hands of Aphrodite (Venus), are forecast and, as it were, subsumed, right from the very first scene of the play, in Hippolyte's portentous line: La fine de Minos et de Pasiphae (Phedre I.i.36). Similarly, in La Thebaide, the recurrent words sang and nature (= naissance, famille, race) and de-</page><page sequence="12">KURT WEINBERG 97 nature foreshadow the inescapable doom of the unfortunate children of Oedipus who bear as little responsibility for their existence as does their father for his incestuous marriage with Jocasta or for the death of Laius. "No one is responsible for his deeds, no one for his nature" (I 481 [?39]). In speaking of morality where all is a matter of predestination, one would risk making a mockery of the very spirit of tragedy, which Nietzsche defines in these terms: "To understand the world from the viewpoint of suffering: that is the tragic essence of tragedy" (das ist das Tragische an der Trag6die) (111338). Would not "moral" actions depend on the triumph of reason over excessive passions and desires? Yet, any attempt to distinguish between "reason" and "passion" would amount to a misconstruction of both: For, reason is no more than "a relation- ship between different passions and desires" (III 648). All intentions, all actions, as it were, are amoral, since all reason- ing about underlying motives and emotions-as we have seen-turns out to be a fabric of rationalizations. In fact, "the healthier, the stronger, ... the more enterprising a man feels, the greater his amorality" (III 919); any rise in vitality inevitably brings with it "an increase in amorality" (III 583). In what precisely consists the preeminence of any great civilization, e.g. the Renaissance in Italy, over a barbarian state of affairs? "Always in one thing: the great quantum of frankly admitted amorality" (III 572). The higher species of man differs from all lower ones not for reasons of greater moral distinction but because of a more refined esthetic organization which lies beyond "good" and "evil," en- abling them to "see and hear infinitely more and to think while they are seeing and hearing" (II 176 [?301]). For Nietzsche as for Baudelaire (whom he depreciates), esthetics and bourgeois morality are.diametri- cally opposed, ideal beauty and greatness incompatible with the meek- ness of a "virtue" which allows the secret showings of criminal fan- tasies in the theatre of the mind but with feigned indignation shrinks from the admission of criminal fantasies, out of hypocrisy, cowardice, and the fear of being caught. "All great men were criminals, not in a miserable sense . .. Crime and greatness belong together," proclaims Nietzsche (III 521f.)-always speaking from the viewpoint of esthet- ics and tragic knowledge, and somewhere in the neighborhood of Baudelaire's ideal beauty (Ce qu'il faut a' ce coeur profond comme un abime / C'est vous, Lady Macbeth, amepuissante au crime, etc.). Seen in the perspective of life and its stimulation, the ascetic val- ues of "virtue" diminish man: "One is a thoroughly small type of man if one is only virtuous" (III 603); "a virtuous man: a lower species" (III</page><page sequence="13">98 Yale French Studies 604)-in fact, a living lie, a denial of human reality. Modern man in his worm-like, purely economic and social existence is striving for an even smaller meaning of life, for smaller risks, lesser dangers, perfect secu- rity. "Has not the self-diminution of man made irresistible strides since Copernicus?" (II 893 [?25]). In order to enjoy "security," men have de- clared their equality (I 892 [?31] ). Greatness in man results from the free reins he gives to his senses, to the free play of his appetites, and from "the still greater power that knows how to employ in its service these monsters" (III 528): the amoral, ancestral, and tragic will to power-for "the only power which exists is equal in kind to [this] will" (111 473). All great works and deeds which were not swept away by the ages-were they not, asks Nietzsche, "in the deepest sense, amoralities? " (111 920). Morality itself, when seen from the only valid perspective, from the viewpoint -of the tragic heightening of life, is not truly a "moral" force but merely one tool among many used in the economy of vitality: in the service of life itself, the apparent opposites of "good" and "evil" do not appear as absolutes, they merely "express power-degrees of the in- stincts, a temporary hierarchy by means of which certain instincts are kept under control" (III 615). The heroes and heroines of Greek and Racinian tragedy, driven by hybris and violent passions to their own immolation, live in a state of tension, pathos, insecurity. They approach with every strep they take their imminent fall. Idealizations of the great criminal in his utter iso- lation, they are examples of a hard, cold, and tragic greatness which, for sentimental nineteenth-century man in his quest for material comfort and security, had lost its meaning. For the Greeks, 'even "theft, as in Prometheus' case, even the massacre of cattle as the expression of a mad envy, as in Ajax' case" could have dignity: "In their need to ascribe dignity to crime .. . they invented tragedy" (II 132 [?135]). The ethical background of tragedy is seen, in The Birth of Tragedy, in the "justifi- cation of human evil" (I 59 [?9]). In this sense, the pathos of tragedy is the life-asserting pathos par excellence (II 1129 [? 1], the very op~posite of the will- and life-denying pessimism of Schopenhauer: it accepts and gives meaning to the dual necessity of becoming and of annihilation. "The depth of the tragic artist consists in the ability of his esthetic in- stinct to see at a glance the farthest consequences, and not myopically to stop at the nearest point: he is capable of accepting the economy of the whole on the largest scale, which justifies, and not merely justifies, the fearful nature of evil and all that is questionable" (III 575). Life is illogical, hence unjust (I 471 [?32]; cf. 1443 [?6]; 1229 [?3]). To</page><page sequence="14">KURT WEINBERG 99 Aristotle's catharsis, Nietzsche opposes the esthetic enhancement of life by an art form which cannot be explained in moral terms (I 131 [?24]). The purpose of tragedy is not to move the spectator to fear and pity; it is to awaken in him the "poetic state"-a thought which is echoed by Valery (Variete V 138). To see in tragedy a purgative which releases a state of depression is to misunderstand its tonic effect, the stimulus it provides for life: the festive spectacle of human suffering "ignites pleasure (i.e. the awareness of strength)" (III 753; III 828f.; cf. I 571 [?212]; etc.). Nietzsche's Dionysian concept of tragedy as a tonic to life, an in- toxication for the senses, in the final analysis is not so far removed from (and considerably more palatable than) that of Tertullian and Thomas Aquinas-who advise the believer to abstain from the sin of visiting theatres on earth, all the more to enjoy in after-life the edifying and eter- nal spectacle of the damned roasting in hell (II 794 [?15]). Nietzsche's theories on the guiltless and fated misfortune of the sacrificial tragic hero, in the end, replace all Leibnitzian and post-Leibnitzian Theod- icees by a Tyrannodicee which amounts to an esthetic justification of human evil and injustice. Finally, Nietzsche's perennial exaltation of life over intelligence, his distrust of reason and "virtuous" intentions seems to present an un- expected twist by which his abandoned Lutheran faith takes its revenge for its long inhibition. It turns out to be a variation on a traditional Au- gustinian theme: the corruption of man's original state of nobility by the knowledge of "good" and "evil." By leaving the noumenal for the phenomenal, ethics and consciousness for esthetics and aisthesis, in- tellectual knowledge for the intuition of the instincts, in short by sub- stituting what N. 0. Brown has so aptly named "polymorphous per- versity" for an illusory morality, Nietzsche's road to the recovery of a tragic and Dionysian innocence-as in all apocalyptic schemes of the nineteenth century-leads for modern man "down and out," through nihilism.</page></plain_text>
