On the basis of extensive surveys carried out in 1958, the Idaho State College Museum set up three field projects for the summer of 1959. Earl Swan- son reports that an intensive survey of the Owyhee Desert in southwestern Idaho was begun in May, sup- ported by a grant from the American Philosophical Society. Ruth Gruhn of Harvard University directed an excavation crew in a large lava cave near Dietrich. Field work was begun in June, under a grant from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences to J. 0. Brew and with additional support from the Idaho State Col- ege Museum. A third field project was conducted along the Snake River plain near American Falls on early types of tools and their relationship to prehistoric cli- mates in the region. WASHINGTON. During this past summer, crews from Washington State University at Pullman excavated in the Ice Harbor Reservoir area on the lower Snake River and in the Rocky Reach Reservoir on the Columbia River. The annual summer field school in archaeology, with 20 students enrolled, conducted excavations of a burial island and a pit house village on the lower Snake River under the direction of Richard Daugherty with a National Park Service contract. A crew of eight, under the field direction of Roderick Sprague, a grad- uate student at Washington State University, conducted extensive testing operations at a number of sites in the Rocky Reach Reservoir. This is the first systematic excavation along this stretch of the Columbia and pro- vides interesting material for comparison with archae- ologically better known regions. OREGON. The University of Oregon continued salvage excavations commenced in 1958 in the John Day Reser- voir under contract with the National Park Service. David L. Cole was field director. BRITISH COLUMBIA. Katherine Capes continued in- vestigations on Vancouver Island under the auspices of the National Museum of Canada. During the past spring and summer she excavated a contact-period site at Sand- wick, one mile north of Courtenay. The University of British Columbia began excavations at the deeply stratified Fraser Canyon site DjRi 3. The project, which is under the direction of Charles E. Bor- den, is being financed by grants from the National Museum of Canada, the Koerner Foundation, and the U. B. C. Committee on Research. Site surveys in the drainage system of the lower Fraser were conducted. Assembled by CHARLES E. BORDEN CALIFORNIA The Southwest Museum conducted two weeks of excavations in March, 1959, on San Nicolas Island at sites SNI-38 and SNI-51 under the direction of Charles Rozaire with help from George Kritzman, Dave Rice, Edward Mitchell, and Lynn Bailey. Interest centered in obtaining quantities of woven sea grass for analysis of technique, but in addition the sites yielded shell fish- hooks, bone gorge hooks and awls, and some flaked stone implements. A sea cave with incised petroglyphs was also recorded. The San Fernando Valley State College continued its work at the shell midden site of Simomo (VE-26) near Point Mugu in southwestern Ventura County as a part of its field course in archaeology which was supervised during the Spring of 1959 by Charles Rozaire. Pits ex- tended below the 9-foot level and produced several burials, projectile points, bone awls, bone and pestle frag- ments, and bone tubes with shell overlay in asphaltum. A cooperative program by the State Indian Museum and the American River Junior College during the Easter vacation of 1959 consisted of test excavation of the Wat- son site (Sut-24). The field work was directed by Wil- liam H. Olson for the State Indian Museum at Sacra- mento. Excavations at this site demonstrate that it is of special importance because it covers a period of time from Late Middle Horizon to Early Phase 1 of the Late Horizon, seemingly a period of cultural transition. Olson's work here demonstrates that this site has cultural affini- ties with both the central and northern Sacramento Valley regions as well as with certain aspects of the Mar- tis complex of the central Sierra. A total of 19 burials was recovered by the State Indian Museum crew. The Archaeological Field Methods class of the Sacra- mento State College under the direction of William J. Beeson has conducted a program of excavation at the Mosier site (Sac-56) on the Sacramento River south of the city of Sacramento. After two semesters of work Beeson and his crew have recovered 15 burials. This site is the type site for Phase 2 of the Late Horizon of central California. Beeson's most recent excavations, however, demonstrate that Middle Horizon materials occur in the lower levels of the site. Assembled by FRANCIS A. RIDDELL 303</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY NORTHEAST HISTORIC SITES. The National Park Service, John Cot- ter relates, continued tests in three of its sites. During the spring of 1959, B. Bruce Powell and Jackson Moore located features connected with early utility buildings in Independence Hail National Historic Park. The in- vestigation of the Hopewell Village, near Pottstown, Pennsylvania, continued. Former grade elevations and features connected with the original barn near the Iron- master's House were disclosed. The development of this site is now well advanced and the new visitor center museum displays the results of the archaeological inves- tigations. The grounds of the General Schuyler House at Schuylerville, New York, have been investigated and artifacts representing the early 19th century have been assembled. Various outbuildings and architectural fea- tures of the house itself have been identified thereby providing accuracy for interpretation and reconstruction. Members of the Northeastern Chapter of the Arche- ological Society of Maryland have been working with the "Friends of Rodgers Tavern" in obtaining data for the restoration of Rodgers Tavern. They have sifted the dirt floor of the former barroom and recovered frag- ments of glass, clay marbles, bullets, slate pencils, clay pipe stems, and a few coins. These indicate the bar- room was used during the 1860's when a horse and mule training station existed at Perry Point. Rodgers Tavern, near Perryville, Maryland, was built in 1771 and opened as a tavern in 1780. Diaries of George Washington in- dicate this served him frequently as a stopping place. The Society for the Preservation of Maryland Antiquity recently purchased the property. NEW YORK CITY. Julius Lopez and Stanley Wisniew- ski have conducted historical research in connection with the Schurz Avenue and Fort Independence sites. Other members of the New York City Archaeological Group conducted a survey at Lost Village, Dutchess County, New York, finding both Indian and Colonial levels of occupation. Lopez and Wisniewski have con- tinued studying and photographing local material in private and institutional collections. ONTARIO. Clyde C. Kennedy sought the location of the island occupied by "Algommequin" Indians in 1613. This village was visited in 1613 by Samuel de Champlain. Conclusive evidence has not been recovered, but it is strongly suggested that this was located on Morrison's Island in the Ottawa River, near Pembroke. Historic material was recovered as was evidence of a Point Pen- insula (Middle Woodland) occupation. Frank Ridley continued his survey of northern Ontario where he sought the locations of early trading posts. Late prehistoric sites were investigated in several parts of Ontario. Walter A. Kenyon reports that the Pithers Point mound excavated by the Royal Ontario Museum proved to be a pile of refuse left by the Assiniboin. This identification is based upon the recovery of quantities of pottery. He also noted evidence of an Old Copper occupation in the area. Pithers Point is located at the outlet of Rainy Lake. J. Norman Emerson, University of Toronto, examined a prehistoric Iroquoian village of the Lalonde stage in West Gwillimbury Township. This was found while attempting to salvage skeletal material from a gravel pit on Norman Bosomworth's property. Evidence of direct association between the burials and village is lacking. However, J. E. Anderson is analyzing the skeletal material which promises to provide interesting insights on the food habits of the people. Richard Pearson, University of Toronto, reports excavations on the MacDonald site, Prince Edward County. This is a prehistoric Iroquois site yielding pottery identified as early Mohawk, Onon- daga, and Huron. It is thought to be a site occupied during the early 14th century and sharing traits with the Roebuck and Woodridge sites. Wilfrid Jury, University of Western Ontario, reports continued excavations on the Forget site. This is an early prehistoric village near Wyebridge. He also located seven Huron sites in the area. Additional information on activities in Ontario is reported in "New Pages of Prehistory, 1958," Ontario History, Volume 51, Number 1, 1959. MARYLAND. Members of the Southwestern Chapter, Archeological Society of Maryland, have been inves- tigating the Seneca Hotel site (18 Mo 5). W. A. Tid- well gives the location of this site as near the junction of Seneca Creek and the Potomac River. The evidence recovered indicates continued, or repeated, occupation over a long period of time. Archaic material has been recovered as well as some suggesting an Early Woodland occupation. A radiocarbon reading, obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey Laboratory (Sample W-798), is 1960 + 160 years ago, based upon charcoal recovered from a fire pit in the western part of the site. No artifacts were found in direct association with this fire pit, so the period of occupation represented is conjectural. Two additional radiocarbon dates have been obtained for the main crematory pit in the West River site (18 An 18). This site and others, near Chesapeake Bay, in Maryland, produced evidence of a close cultural rela- tionship with the Adena Culture of Ohio. The new dates, based upon charcoal samples are consistent with two dates, obtained previously. The new readings, run by the University of Michigan, Memorial-Phoenix Pro- ject Radiocarbon Laboratory, are: M-416a; 2310? 200 years ago, and M-417a; 1850?+200 years ago. PENNSYLVANIA. Don W. Dragoo of the Carnegie Mu- seum, Pittsburgh, continued investigations of upper Ohio Valley Adena sites during the summer. As well as gather- ing information from all known Adena sites in the area he checked collections in several institutions. Assembled by ALFRED K. GUTHE SOUTHEAST GEORGIA. The Smithsonian Institution worked in the Columbia and Walter F. George basins on the Chatta- hoochee River with three crews under Harold Huscher, Newman, and G. Hubert Smith which dug until July 304 [ VOL. 25, No. 2, 1959</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND NEWS 1 at a series of sites, the most important of which was the Indian-Georgian town of Roanoke which burned in 1836. Other sites indicated the presence of a Macon Plateau, Early Mississippian phase on the Chattahoochee, and perhaps confirmation of Caldwell's exclusively check- stamped interval following the Weeden Island phase. Archaic sites with fiber-tempered pottery and heavy flints were found deeply buried. The University of Georgia began excavations under A. R. Kelly and Edward V. McMichael on the Chatta- hoochee at the Standley Farm, with occupations extend- ing from South Appalachian phases through Mississip- pian. The Bull Creek site was also re-excavated to learn more about the complex relationships of Fort Walton and Lamar with the many flamboyant features known to be present at Bull Creek. The University also con- ducted contract work for the Georgia Power Company at the Morgan Falls Redevelopment Project in north- central Georgia where a series of rock shelters was in- vestigated. The 1959 session of the Southeastern Archeological Conference will be held at Ocmulgee National Monu- ment, Macon, on November 13-14. Robert Bray is in charge of local reservations and arrangements; Stephen Williams is general chairman of the pottery workshop sessions. It is hoped that some progress can be made towards reducing the profusion of southeastern pottery names. The Macon Archeological Society has been inves- tigating a large, probably earth-covered house at Brown's Mount. This site is similar to the Macon Plateau com- ponent and it is hoped that the charcoal collected will date the Macon Plateau phase. Previous samples from Macon Plateau have been rendered useless by preserva- tion with parafin or plastic. FLORIDA. John Goggin and William Massey continued the excavation and underwater exploration of a number of sites in Taylor County dating from the Deptford and Weeden Island phases. The University of Florida was also engaged in the exploration of a large spring on the west coast where large numbers of human remains had been reported. Goggin continues his development of underwater techniques and equipment for underwater work which he feels can attain a stature approaching that of "dirt" archaeology. Ripley P. Bullen, Florida State Museum, excavated in a large site near Osprey, and William H. Sears surveyed in the vicinity of the Ochlock- onee estuary and mapped a number of large, previously known sites. Edward M. Dolam joined the Florida State Museum as a temporary field supervisor in the summer. At Florida State University Hale G. Smith and Charles H. Fairbanks continued the excavation of the Delp Mound with student crews. Some additional collections were also made at Sinclair Landing, the site of the Panton Leslie store. The University of Alabama and the Florida State University jointly conducted a field school in the Weiss Reservoir with the additional sponsorship of the Alabama Geological Survey and the Alabama Power Company. Three field crews totaling 34 students worked at a variety of sites under the direction of David L. Dejarnette and Fairbanks. Hale G. Smith and Robert Steinback continued ex- cavation in St. Augustine for the St. Augustine His- torical Society, excavating structures in colonial St. Augustine which are mostly of the early 18th century. MIssISSIPPI. Stephen Williams began the second sea- son of work at the large Lake George site in Yazoo County, a major ceremonial center with some 25 mounds and a wall enclosing 50 acres. Three phases are rep- resented: Coles Creek, Plaquemine, and Lake George. The 1959 excavations continued in a Coles Creek phase burial mound that has already yielded 25 burials without associated offerings. Williams hopes to work out the settlement patterns of the three phases. NORTH CAROLINA. Work continued on colonial sites. Tryon Palace, the first fixed colonial capital of North Carolina in 1770, was opened as a historic house ex- hibit. This work was made possible through gifts of Mrs. Maude Moore Latham. Excavation and exhibition at Old Brunswick Town continued under Stanley South. Assembled by CHARLES H. FAIRBANKS SOUTHWEST On June 18, 1959, William W. Wasley, archaeologist for the Arizona State Museum, and James E. Officer, Department of Sociology, University of Arizona, visited La Cueva de las Tunas near Y6cora in the sierra of eastern Sonora, Mexico, at the invitation of the Uni- versity of Sonora. The trip was part of an investigation into the circumstances of discovery of the Yecora mum- my, now on exhibit at the University Museum in Her- mosillo, Sonora. There was no other evidence of mummification in the cave, although some well preserved skeletal material was encountered in the disturbed cave debris. The roof and walls of this cave are definitely moist, and although there is a very dry upper layer of debris about 30 to 50 cm. thick, the lower cave deposit is quite damp. Thus, the general conditions of the cave do not appear capable of producing natural mummification. In this Wasley and Officer are in complete agreement with statements in the Mexico City press attributed to Arturo Romano, Director of Prehistory at the Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History (I. N. A. H.). There seems to be some basis for believing that while the mummy was actually "discovered" in La Cueva de las Tunas, it was brought there from its original location. Assembled by WILLIAM W. WASLEY MIDDLE AMERICA Mesoamerican archaeology was well represented at the Twenty-Fourth Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology, Salt Lake City, April 30-May 2. Four speakers, Richard H. Brooks, J. Charles Kelley, 305</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Charles C. Di Peso, and William W. Wasley, presented papers with important data relevant to Mesoamerican- Southwestern contacts, reporting, respectively, on work in the Sierra Madre Occidental, the Chalchihuites cul- ture area of Durango, Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, and near Gila Bend in southern Arizona. In addition, Walter W. Taylor reported on his investigation of a cave site in Sonora, the artifacts of which display limited ties to the north and west. It is evident that northwestern Mexico, so long a relatively terra incognita on the North American archaeological map, is finally receiving the attention it has so long deserved. Northeastern Mexico, even more neglected until recently, figured in reports by Richard S. MacNeish and H. B. Nicholson. The former discussed the remarkably long sequence( approximately 9000 years) of well-preserved plant remains of southern Tamaulipas and its implications for New World agricultural origins and dispersals; the latter described a recent investigation of the largest Pueblito Tradition house-platform site in the Sierra de Tamaulipas, falling temporally in the Classic. West Mexico was represented by Clement W. Meighan's report on the UCLA excavation at Amapa, Nayarit (see below). Two participants in the New World Archaeological Foundation's project at Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Gareth W. Lowe, the field director, and Bruce Warren, reported on aspects of their work in this key region of Mesoamerica's heartland: the long Preclassic architectural sequence at the principal site and the widespread ceramic connections of the third sequential phase (Chiapa III). Suzanne W. Miles and Heath-Jones presented complementary papers on Preclassic esthetic and epigraphic traditions of the highlands and Pacific slope of Guatemala and adjoining regions, sparked by the recent discovery of two extraordinary stelae at Kaminaljuyu, one with what may well be the earliest hieroglyphic text yet found in Mesoamerica, with im- portant implications for a more accurate conception of the role of Highland Guatemala in the genesis of Classic Maya civilization. Jeremiah F. Epstein discussed the ceramic sequence of northeastern Honduras, with special attention to the so-called "Chibchan thrust" after the at least partial withdrawal of the formerly dominant Mesoamerican influences. More general papers were pre- sented by Bertha P. Dutton, who discussed Mesoamerican ballcourts, with emphasis on their ritual-mythologic as- sociations; William J. Mayer-Oakes, who presented a developmental concept of pre-Spanish urbanization in the Valley of Mexico, stemming from his El Risco ex- cavation; and Thomas S. Ferguson, who discussed various symbols and cultural elements he believes were common to the ancient Near East and Mesoamerica. CENTRAL MEXICO. Sidney E. White, Department of Geology, Ohio State University, has terminated a ten- year program of geologic investigations of the late Plei- stocene history of the southern end of the Sierra Nevada, the range of high volcanic peaks bordering the Basin of Mexico east of Mexico City. When the program was inaugurated in 1949 and 1950 by two summer expeditions to Popocatepetl, the ambitious intent was to date by direct means the lake sediments of the Mexico Basin, but it was discovered that glacial outwash from this volcano passed east into the Valley of Puebla and thence south through the Rio Balsas Basin to the Pacific. Sub- sequent study of the next volcano to the north, Iztac- cihuatl, in 1953, 1955, 1956, and 1959, revealed a se- quence of multiple glaciation of probable Wisconsin age, but the sediment of the voluminous alluvial fans of glacial origin built against the west edge of the moun- tain as yet has not been traced to the lake floor in the center of the Basin. The late Pleistocene glacial se- quence now established, however, may become useful in correlation for the Mexican archaeologists. The work of the Centro de Investigaciones Antro- polo6gicas de M6xico in the Ostoyohualco Plaza of Teo- tihuacan, under the direction of Carmen Cook de Leo- nard and Juan Leonard, last reported in the C. I. A. M. Bulletin No. 4, has been progressing. The East Pyramid was found to contain an interior structure, probably Teotihuacan I, with a stone roof and wooden posts on one side. This had been sacked in Teotihuacan III times, entrance being made through the front stairway, following which another pyramid was built over it. To test the pos- sibility of the existence of a pyramid which had not been sacked, the central one was approached from the front. Three intact stair superpositions were found. The pyra- mid was pierced from the front, cutting half of the inner- most staircase and a tunnel was dug towards the rear of the pyramid, from south to north. The rear part of the pyramid was found to contain a cemetery, in which 12 burials have been located, ten recovered. The offerings are mostly Tlaloc vases with ocher paint; they also in- cluded a stone frog painted red, ceremonial flint knives painted red on white, and a necklace made of human molars, and bone imitations thereof, probably arranged in circles to represent a corncob. Aside from the ceme- tery, two older interior pyramid structures were found, one similar to the Cuicuilco style. At the time of the first report, the access to the ceremonial center had not been found. On the south side there are remains, to one side of the exact center, which lead up to the ramp. In later times, probably Teotihuacan III, a 35-foot wide staircase coming down from the north side was used. Both entrances have two superimposed constructions. OAXACA. During December and January of 1958-59, Ignacio Bernal worked at Yagul. A large amount of superficial clearing and some stratigraphic work was ac- complished in a complex of six or seven patios and their surrounding rooms, both patios and rooms practically identical to those in the group of the church at Mitla. Even though most of the work consisted only of clearing the debris from these structures, the results of the season are judged to have been quite important. Relatively abun- dant finds of polychrome pottery constitute the most striking discovery. This material includes some which seems to conform rather closely to Cholulteca style, but most of it appears to be a previously unknown variant of Mixtec-style polychrome. Excavation in a large pit revealed that these structures of pure Mitla style were 306 [ VOL. 25, No. 2, 1959</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND NEWS rebuilt and superimposed several times in the same place. In addition, the diagnostic Mixtec style poly- chrome was found in considerable quantity under the uppermost floor. It occurred, along with the diagnostic Mixtec-style gray wares, in decreasing quantity under the earlier floors. Bernal is presently pursuing the analy- sis of these finds and hopes to continue work in the same group during the winter of 1959-60 to finish the clearing and to carry forward other aspects of the investigation. At the time of this writing, the Mexico City College group, under the direction of John Paddock, was plan- ning to conduct a week and a half of their summer ar- chaeological field school at the Caballito Blanco site, near Yagul, first explored last year. Their next regular field session, planned for the winter of 1959-60, may carry forward the work at this important site. WEST MEXICO. The excavations of the University of California (Los Angeles) at Amapa, Nayarit terminated in March. They were directed by Clement W. Meighan who was assisted by Betty Bell, Mildred Wissler, Jack Smith, Gordon Grosscup, Frank Clune, and David Pendergast, all graduate students at U. C. L. A. High- lights of the season include the discovery of well over 600 whole or restorable pottery vessels, decorated in a remarkable variety of diverse styles (many new to West Mexican archaeology), the majority found in two rich cemetery areas in which over 100 graves were recorded; the northwesternmost ballcourt yet excavated in Meso- america, capital I-shaped, partly of stone construction, with circular stone center markers of unique shape; two large mounds with cut stone stairways, unexpected this far northwest in Mesoamerica; and various incised stone slabs, displaying both anthropomorphic and zoomorphic motifs. Temporally, the occupation of the site almost certainly began some time during the Middle or Late Classic, although the major manifestation appears to fall in the early Postclassic (flattish Mazapan-like figurines and copper objects were fairly common in certain areas of the site). Analysis of the large collection is now underway, in which a number of U. C. L. A. graduate students who participated in the excavation are playing a major role. CHIAPAS. In February, Richard S. MacNeish, in con- junction with the New World Archaeological Foundation and assisted by one of their collaborators, Frederick Peter- son, excavated a rock shelter with important results. The stratigraphy within the 2.5-meter refuse deposit was very clear, the top stratum containing in its upper portion some Postclassic sherds but mainly consisting of Classic materials. The next level contained some Classic and very late Formative (Chiapa V) remains. Zone C was pure Chiapa I and very early Formative. Zones D, E, F, and G were all preceramic and belong to what MacNeish is calling the Santa Marta complex. In these zones were found four skeletons, a cob of Pod-Pop corn, and over 100 lithic artifacts, including flake side scrapers, domed and flat top scraping planes, ovoid bifaces, pebble and slab choppers, crude blade tools struck from conical polyhedral cores, pebble manos and boulder mullers, as well as four types of projectile points closely resem- bling certain types previously found by MacNeish in Tamaulipas. Further work is contemplated in other dry caves of this region. This is the first well-documented preceramic phase yet delimited in Highland Chiapas and extends the long sequence there considerably back in time. LOWLAND MAYA REGION. The first season's excavation of Altar de Sacrificios, near the junction of the Chixoy (Salinas) and Pasi6n rivers, in the southwest Peten, Guatemala, ran from February to May. This project, financed by the National Science Foundation, is directed by Gordon R. Willey of Harvard University. A. Ledyard Smith is field director and was assisted this season by John Graham and William Bullard. A sizable camp in- stallation was completed, the major ceremonial units were mapped, and numerous outlying smaller mounds were discovered. Important new discoveries include a ballcourt of the Lowland Maya Classic style and a new stela which bears a 9.9.0.0.0 date (tentative reading). The site was unquestionably occupied throughout the Classic and was probably a major center for esthetically superior, carved Fine Orange pottery, probably of the Y variety. Willey also reports that the analysis of the ceramics recovered at Barton Ramie during the Harvard Low- land Maya settlement patterns project of 1953-56 is well underway, with James C. Gifford assisting. The final report of the project is being prepared; it will be based upon the work at Barton Ramie but will include observa- tions on prehistoric Maya settlement patterns of the Belize Valley generally and in other parts of the Maya Lowlands. The University Museum of the University of Penn- sylvania pursued its fourth season of major archaeological and ecological investigations at Tikal during the spring and summer months. The field staff, under the direction of Edwin M. Shook, consisted of W. R. Coe, Vivian Bro- man, Stuart Scott, W. A. Haviland, Linton Satterthwaite, and George Guillemin, archaeologists; A. S. Trik, ar- chitect; R. F. Carr, surveyor; and M. B. Ricketson and B. Levine, laboratory assistants. Ecological studies were carried on by F. B. Smithe (ornithology), C. L. Lundell (botany), Edwin Littman (chemistry), and George and Ursula Cowgill (pollen). Additional archaeological staff for summer excavations included Ann Chowning, Keith Dixon, Peter Harrison, Philip Auerbach, and Norman Johnston. The long Preclassic sequence of occupation in the Great Plaza, encountered in 1958, was intensively inves- tigated, as well as overlying Classic and Postclassic re- mains. Excavations penetrated from surface to bedrock wherever practical in an extensive zone of the center of the site. The bedrock surface in each case had been modified by the early inhabitants so that no undisturbed remains comparable to the black dirt or Mamon level at Uaxactuin have yet been found in Tikal. Mamon ceramic types occur mixed, presumably through redeposition, in late Preclassic (Chicanel) levels. 307</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Deep trenching and tunneling of Early and Late Clas- sic structures brought to light further evidence of the changing complexity of Maya ceremonialism and the cultural disjunction between Preclassic and Classic Maya culture, as well as evidence of internal strife during the Classic Period. One large, formally constructed vaulted tomb, in- trusively cut into the stairway of Structure 34 (Temple of the Red Stela), was found to be empty, evidently sacked during the occupation of the site. Farther inside the same structure and deeply penetrating underlying limestone bedrock, another large, richly stocked tomb was discovered. This important interment just preceded the construction of the Early Classic Temple of the Red Stela. Also encountered on the axial line of the temple was a votive cache with a covered pottery vessel con- taining among shells and other marine offerings an exquisitely modeled Maya head encrusted with jade and shell elements. The breakage, disturbance, resetting of stela frag- ments, the epigraphy, and the offerings associated with stelae were studied by Coe, Haviland, and Satterthwaite. They and Guillemin continued the assemblage, repair, and re-erection of Tikal monuments, while Trik initiated the architectural repair of Great Temple I and a twin pyramid complex in Group E. Casts of the original carved wood lintels from Temple I were replaced, and the interior of the temple completely repaired. The important H Group area north of the center of the site and joined to it by two large causeways was mapped by Car. He discovered numerous architectural units not previously known, several plain stelae, carved Stela 30, and Altar 14 (which bore the Initial Series date: 9.13.0.0.0). Other newly discovered carved stelae and altars include Stela 27 (9.3.0.0.0), 28 (undated, Early Period), and 29, which bears the earliest contempora- neous Initial Series date (8.12.14.8.15) so far found in the Maya area, predating Stela 9 at Uaxactun by 36 years and the Leyden Plate by 28 years. The summer excavations, still in progress at time of writing, have initiated investigations of domestic archi- tecture and associated household rubbish. Selected for thorough excavation were several low housemounds, which had not been visible in the dense tropical forest until extensive clearing had been done. These mounds did not appear on the accurately surveyed topographic map of the area, but showed up as low undulations on the ground surface when vegetation was removed. The excavations, covering only a small restricted area, have brought to light a complex arrangement of plat- forms and terraces just under the surface, over 10,000 potsherds, quantities of stone, bone, and shell artifacts, burials, caches, and so on. The uppermost levels con- tain early Postclassic plumbate pottery, spindle whorls, incensarios, and a ceramic complex heretofore ill-defined in the Pet6n. This, in addition to evidence from the previous season's excavations, indicates that habitation did not cease entirely at Tikal after the Classic, as was widely believed previously. Tohil Plumbate and X Fine Orange found in Tikal demonstrate a certain amount of occupation during early Postclassic times, while other ceramic types, especially censers, further indicate some activity here as late as late Postclassic times. J. Eric S. Thompson, the dean of living Mayanists, now resident in England, recently completed a trip to Mexico and British Honduras, where he visited various archaeological sites. In Merida, he was awarded an L.L.D. by the Universidad de Yucatin, in recognition of his many signal contributions to Maya culture history, partic- ularly his fundamental epigraphic and calendric studies. He is continuing work on his great catalogue of all glyphs (excluding the strictly calendrical) on the monuments and hopes to have a summary of his progress ready soon. Thompson's Maya Hieroglyphic Writing: Introduc- tion (1950), indispensable to all workers in this field and long out of print, is scheduled for a limited second edition, in offset, at a moderate price, to be published soon by the University of Oklahoma Press. Mayanists were saddened during the early part of the year by the death, at 93, of the distinguished Yucatec Maya scholar, Juan Martinez Hernandez, whose work with the Maya chronicles and the calendric correlation problem is well known to all students of Mesoamerica's past. CENTRAL AMERICA. Wolfgang Haberland of the Mu- seum fiir Volkerkunde, Hamburg, is continuing his vig- orous program of Central American investigations. Dur- ing the past year he undertook the following surveys and excavations. In El Salvador he pursued studies intended to sup- plement the results of his earlier 1953-54 season, with the particular aim of clarifying the status of certain putatively Formative phases, Atiquizaya in the west, and Gualacho and the sequent Los Frailes phases in the east. The first two appear to fall more or less at the beginning of their respective sequences in these funda- mentally different regions. Atiquizaya seems to be the earlier, with clear connections with the Guatemala high- lands, possibly on a time level as early as Las Charcas. Haberland has worked out a tentative sequence, largely based on typology, for both western and eastern zones. Through cross-ties between east and west and from the west to the Maya area, he has been able to construct a tentative chronologic framework. In the central region of the country he sank a stratigraphic trench into a large pyramid crudely constructed of boulders, called San Francsico, near Aguilares, which may display two construction phases. Although sherds from the sur- rounding area indicated that it might date from Pipil times, sherds found in the fill supported a Late Classic or early Postclassic date for the structure. He also did considerable photographing of pieces in private col- lections. He is presently working on a report intended to clarify the still very confused Salvadoran sequences, which will include evidence that the important Usulutan Complex should be split up into different time levels. In Nicaragua he devoted most of his stay to testing sites in the vicinity of Moyogalpa, on the island of Ome- [ VOL. 25, No. 2, 1959 308</page><page sequence="7">NOTES AND NEWS tepe. In addition to plentiful quantities of sherds, a sha- man's grave and what appeared to be a ceremonial dog burial were found. Some further very limited testing was undertaken in the Granada area, where Willey was later active. In Costa Rica, with Buenos Aires in the Valle del General as base, Haberland further investigated the Boruca phase of Classic Chiriqui, excavating 37 burials in three different cemeteries. He also located a habita- tion site, heretofore virtually unknown in this region, and surveyed the Osa Peninsula where he found indications of a new Chiriqui phase. He now believes that Classic Chiriqui must be divided into at least seven distinct phases: Boruca, Highland Chiriqui, Lowland Chiriqui, Armuelles, Osa, Rio Diquis, and Coto Brus (the last two somewhat more problematical). Investigations near Dominical on the Pacific coast off San Isidro del General also yielded some generalized Chiriqui material. In Panama, Haberland concentrated his efforts at Chiriqui, focusing on the problem of the temporal place- ment and spatial distribution of the Formative Aguas Buenas phase, previously located by him in the area of the Costa Rican boundary. Six more sites were located, in a large area, whose artifact complexes were essentially similar. In an attempt to place chronologically the well- known stone statues of the Barriles area within the Chiriqui sequence, a test was made where Stirling had dug ten years previously. The finding of unmistakable Aguas Buenas sherds suggests that the statues belong to this early phase and are probably at least as old as A.D. 1000. In addition, various Classic Chiriqui burials were excavated near La Concepci6n. In connection with this work, evidence was uncovered of two new phases at two different sites, one of which appears to be ap- proximately coeval with Aguas Buenas. The other (Villalba), exposed near David, contains some crude stone monuments and appears to be coeval with Classic Chiriqui; there are some indications it might prove to be transitional between this phase and Veraguas. Tests were also made around Guarare on the Azuero Peninsula, where quantities of sherds, bones, and shells were re- covered from habitation sites and where the artifact assemblages, although displaying certain regional dif- ferences, in general appearance were quite similar to those of the Parita region, where Willey excavated. Haberland also visited Colombia, where he photo- graphed extensively in the museum collections and undertook two small test digs in the region of Medellin. He is presently engaged in analyzing the materials re- covered on this extensive field trip and preparing reports and articles for publication. Gordon R. Willey, assisted by Albert H. Norweb, conducted an archaeological exploration of Nicaragua during February, March, and April, with particular em- phasis on a search for materials which might belong to a Formative period level. Surface collections were taken from 12 sites on the Isthmus of Rivas, between Lake Nicaragua and the Pacific, and at five of these test- pitting operations were conducted. Although the sherd collections recovered have not yet been analyzed, Willey does not believe anything was found which looks as though it might be on a Formative chronological level. However, ceramics in the National Museum of Nicaragua were seen which appeared to have definite Formative resemblances, including the incised Palmer style and Usulutan spouted jars. Continuation of the project is planned for next year. Compiled by H. B. NICHOLSON LOWLAND SOUTH AMERICA BRAZIL. The program of fieldwork sponsored by the Centro de Ensino e Pesquisas Arqueolo6gicas, University of Parani, is continuing actively under the leadership of Wesley R. Hurt and Oldemar Blasi. In January salvage operations were conducted at a cemetery and village site at Porto Brasilia on the bank of the Rio Parana, northwest Parana state. While the area was being cleared for set- tlement, five large polychrome vessels containing second- ary burials were encountered. Excavation revealed the existence of habitation refuse 50 cm. in depth in the same area. Stone artifacts were rare and consisted principally of choppers and scrapers. Pottery decoration includes polychrome painting, fingernail impression, cor- rugation, and incision. The complex resembles that reported by Virginia Watson at a Spanish-Guarani site farther downriver, which is dated between A.D. 1554 and 1750. During February two sites were investigated by Hurt and Blasi at Barracao in southwest Parana. The refuse deposit was again about 50 cm. in thickness. Sherds were sparse and undecorated, but several hundred stone arti- facts were recovered, all of red basalt. Types include plano-convex nuclei, "scraper-planes," unifaced blades and scrapers, and retouched flakes, the majority of which may be artifacts in a primary stage of manufacture rather than completed products. This situation along with the scarcity of pottery suggests the sites may be "work- shops" rather than habitation areas, although no quarries were found in the immediate vicinity. One of the most important events for anthropology in Brazil in recent years is the acquisition of the 300- year old Jesuit Monastery at Paranagua in the state of Parana for a museum of archaeology and folk arts. This building will house the exhibits and laboratories of the Centro de Ensino e Pesquisas Arqueolo6gicas of the Uni- versity of Parana and will serve as a research center for investigation of the numerous sambaqui sites that occur in the vicinity. The museum was dedicated in the latter part of July, when it served as host to the 4th Reunion of the Association of Brazilian Anthropologists. During March, 1959, Peter Paul Hilbert continued his investigations in the Amazon region under the auspices of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia and with the assistance of PETROBRAS. Excavations were under- taken in the vicinity of Tefe on the right bank of the Solim6es. Sherds were abundant and refuse extended to a depth of 60 to 90 cm.

MEGGERS ABSTRACTS OF NEW WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY The first volume of ANWA is scheduled to appear during the summer of 1960 and will be distributed with AMERICAN ANTIQUITY to all members and institutional subscribers withou,t extra charge. Additional copies will be printed for separate sale. The editorial staff will attempt to prepare abstracts of all publications dated 1959 that deal with New World archaeology, regardless of place of publication or language. Books, monographs, serial volumes, and journal articles will be included. In addition, it is hoped that abstracts can be obtained (or at the very least titles) of all M.A. and Ph.D. theses on New World archaeology accepted during 1959; it will be greatly appreciated if anyone knowing of such a thesis will notify the Editor of ANWA, Richard B. Woodbury, Department of Anthropology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona. All abstracts will be in English, will be non-critical, and will include full bibliographic information. We will attempt to convey briefly all the essential information of the original. One of the Society's major long-range aims in instituting this abstract series- and an aim of the Charles F. Brush Foundation in supporting it - is to encourage other journals to publish regularly an abstract of each article. Whenever this is done ANWA will expect to use this abstract, and it is hoped that eventually its staff will need to prepare only a minority of new abstracts. For the present, it will greatly assist in the preparation of the first volume of abstracts if authors of any 1959 publication that they believe should be included would send a copy of it to the Editor of ANWA, who will forward it to the appropriate abstraoter. Where authors cannot furnish copies, notification of the title (with full bibliographical information) will be helpful. Other material, not received from authors, will be abstracted, too, of course, insofar as the editorial staff is able to do so. In addition, any titles for 1957 or 1958 that were omitted from the last two listings of "Some Recent Publications" in this journal should be sent (with bibliographical details) to the Editor of ANWA for listing in the first volume. 310 [ VOL. 25, No. 2, 1959</page></plain_text>
