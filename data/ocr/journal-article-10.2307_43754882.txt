<plain_text><page sequence="1">Like the great silent comedians, Jones could express emotions "through physical detail - and it was beautiful to watch." Qwk Jmw Interview by Greg Ford and Richard Thompson COURTESY JOE ADAMSON BEGINNINGS; EARLY EXPERIMENTATION; REALISM VS. "BELIEVABILITY" CHUCK JONES: Kansas City is where Ub Iwerks started, and Bugs Hardaway, and Hugh Harman and Rudy Ising and Walt and Roy Disney . . .all those people worked for that one little company, Film Ads in Kansas City. And until it kind of pe- tered out, they actually made commercials, commercials for theatrical showing. Walt then came West, and then Friz, Ham Hamilton, classic animators, and they all got established with alice in cartoon - land at Universal. I came up with the next generation - well, generations were sepa- rated by about eight or ten years then. Those of us who had gone to Chouinard Art School in Los Angeles, where could we work? We could go into commercial art or we could go into animation. So I worked with Ub Iwerks, who had split with Disney at the time. I worked for Universal, and then Charles Mintz, and . . .hell, in those days you jumped from studio to studio. But eventually I came to Warner Brothers. Meantime, I worked as a sailor for a while, went to South America or someplace. Q. And as a lumberjack, and a cowboy . . . A: I was called a lumberjack by Disney people who thought I was a communist. Q: What does a lumberjack have in common with a communist? A: Well, they used to say that the Com- munists took "little hairy Jewish people" along when they had a speech to make at a union meeting. When I spoke at a meet- ing, one of the Disney animators said, "How come they're using these big pink lumberjack types now?", and pretty soon everybody was saying it. So I went home and took a look at myself - I was twenty- five - and, sure enough, I was a big pink lumberjack type. And I was a fat lumberjack - two hundred and five pounds. Q: In Positif magazine, they say that Chuck Jones, before he went to Warners, was a lumberjack, and had a big blue ox named Babe. A: That was true. That was a sexual rela- tionship. But anyway . . . Q: Somehow, we've got your chronol- ogy all screwed up. Did you do that before you worked in any animation studios? Or in-between? A: I don't know . . .Anyway, I did it. Q: Your first cartoons, starting from about 1938, seem to make a much greater effort to approximate realistic shape and movement than your later cartoons. A: That really was an effort, learning how to make things move. One of the things I think is basically misunderstood about easel art is that, say, Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenberg, de Kooning, Robert Motherwell can all draw beautifully. They all had line control. They had to learn that, and then they branched out. It's hard to FILM COMMENT 21</page><page sequence="2">CHUCK JONES CONTINUED think of an artist that is worth anything who didn't have this ability. They started with the basics. With those early cartoons, I was learning the basics. What the hell, I started directing when I was twenty -five, so I had to learn the language, and so did my animators. We had classes - for years, we had at least two classes per week, at night. And we were working a five- and -a- half- day week, about fifty -six hours a week. Q: Who conducted the classes? A: I did. And I had to learn at the same time. I went to the lectures that they were having at Disney's with Don Graham. We also went through a whole series of classes from the Art Students League, conducted by Simone Nikoliades, who did those edged drawings, marvelous things, which kind of caught the character. He laid down the law that if you ever want to learn to draw, you have a hundred thousand bad drawings in you. And the sooner you get rid of them, the better you are. So we did thousands of drawings. Q: This realism effects timing, too. An early cartoon like good night elmer [1940] is rather slow - it seems obsessed with realistic movement, shape, and shading. A: The shading was there because of the presence of a single light- source, the can- dle, which was very important. The story was just a tiny thing: a man attempting to put out a little candle. How can you make an entire story about that? Is it possible? That's what I wanted to know. I wouldn't say it was a particularly successful picture, but it was crucial in terms of what came af- terward. You have to stumble a lot, I can't think of any other way of doing anything. There are no short-cuts. And nobody had the time to do a scene and then throw it away - we had to use it in the final film. At Disney's, during the same period, they were experimenting with things and then not using them. They could afford to, but we couldn't. There was nothing wrong with that, but several of the pictures were experimental - some of them worked and some didn't. Some were slow, but I was at- tempting to discover things about timing here, and in the early "Sniffles" films. Be- sides, they didn't seem as slow then, basi- cally because all cartoons weren't at such a fantastic pace. The pace thing started with THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE [1935] at Disney's. Q: One aspect of the tortoise and the hare which you seem to have picked out and expanded in the Pepe Le Pew series is the "Slow and steady wins the race" idea of character action. Pepe maintains his steady pace, while the female cat Pepe is pursuing finally wears herself out with fas- ter but more sporadic movements. A: I did that even earlier in little lion hunter [1939, Jones' first cartoon featuring the native African child Inki and the mysti- cal my nah bird]. The mynah bird was that sort of steady character. I often have music Original art: Daffy Duck in ROBIN HOOD DAFFY (1958). Frisky puppy in NO BARKING (1954). Latinate titles in the Roadrunner cartoons. THE DRAFT HORSE (1941).

In the Inki series, the mynah bird would hop along to "Fingal's Cave Overture/' That was my first experience with Mendelssohn. Q: The vocabulary of Carl Stalling, the regular composer for Warners cartoons, is unbelievable. He can even anticipate the audience's association with the image. For instance, in the middle of the chase in fast and furry -ous [1949], the first "Roadrun- ner" film, you cut to an overhead perspec- tive of this highway cloverleaf that the characters are running around, and Stall- ing immediately refers to "I'm Looking Over a Four- Leaf Clover." He seems to be able to relate to any kind of music. A: There was a reason for that: he was a lead organist at some of the biggest thea- ters in St. Louis and Kansas City, where you had to have everything right at your fingertips. That was one of the reasons he tended to go toward visual titles. When a character was eating something, he'd play "A Cup of Coffee, A Sandwich, And You," even though it might not fit exactly. If it was a lady in a red dress, he'd always play "The Lady in Red," or if a bee, he'd always play "My Funny Little Bumblebee," which was written in 1906. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't - that "Funny Lit- tle Bumblebee" thing was so obscure no one could make the connection. You had to be a hundred and eight years old to even know there was such a song. Q: Around 1941 or 1942 your cartoons seemed to change - they began to present more violent and radical character- motion, and the backgrounds became more stylized. Do you think the War had any ef- fect on this change? A: I think as far as action and subject-matter were concerned, my car- toons actually were gentler before 1941 . . .so I'd agree with that proposition to a limited extent. But generally, no, I don't think there's much of a connection there. In terms of violent character -action, I suppose that I was effected somewhat by both Friz [Freleng] and Tex [Avery]. I al- ways admired their sense of timing and sense of movement, and their gag structures - although they certainly worked differently. You see, after the draft horse [1941], I discovered that I could make people laugh - and not just be amused. And that's a heady thing. You get so you want to make them laugh, or at least make yourself laugh. Q: The draft horse is still very funny today. To begin with, we're confronted with a s uper patrio tic plowhorse, flags in his eyes, who then of course is terrified when he's caught in the middle of some army war-games. A: Well, at this particular time, very early in the Second World War, everybody was in favor of fighting. There were simple terms then. You have to be in contact with the idea of what Adolf Hitler was: he was an enormity, a giant black thing over the horizon. That was something you could see - he was an evil thing. It was the last of the great clearcut conflicts. Nevertheless, within the context of chauvinism, you could discover the idiocy of people just wanting to go throw themselves out in front of the cannon. At least you could be reasonable. Another development is that after this film, and after the war, I worked more with the writer Mike Maltese. He was more of a gagman than Tedd Pierce, with whom I'd been working earlier. Tedd tended to be more of a writer. He was good at structure, and it was a humorous structure - but it wasn't gags. On the other hand, Mike Mal- tese was, and still is, a brilliant gagman. But whatever happened during that period, it probably wasn't due to the War. If anything, the War would have calmed it down. Q: At any rate, we could say that in 1942 there suddenly was a decisive break from that over- awareness of realism. A: Yeah, that's right. I think at that point the language began to be learned, and this group of people working together discov- ered that they were all reasonably facile. The team thing is very important. It gets to the point where you can snap your fingers, or make a single drawing to convey your idea. Whenever a new animator came to work for me, he was in trouble for a while, because on my exposure sheets, I would put down a notation like "BAL" - which was "balance" - or "ANT" - "anticipate." And all my animators had to know exactly what they meant. Q: What did it mean - an anticipation before the actual motion? A: Sure. Or "BAL" might mean that I'd want a particular character solid on his feet before he did something, so you'd know that there was a stability to the thing, be- fore it moved into action. Of course, I used "holds," and animators learned that when I put down a twelve- frame hold, that didn't mean thirteen frames or eleven frames - it meant twelve frames exactly. When the Coyote fell off, I knew he had to go exactly three or four feet and then dis- appear for eighteen frames before he hit. A new animator would come in and he would overlap that, and it would never work. When we'd lay out dances, we began to understand that we could anticipate by one frame. If a step is supposed to come down on a beat, we found out that if you moved it up one frame, it would work, be- cause the throw back to the middle of the theater, thirty rows back, would make the step appear to be exactly on beat. That's just one frame we're talking about, one -twenty -fourth of a second, but we found out it worked best for the entire the- ater if you were one frame ahead of the beat. Q: How often did you use rotoscoping? A: Almost never. Occasionally, when we had to shoot something like a complicated dance, we'd actually take live-action © 1 975 Wairfîêpfi^Dthers, Inc.

We did that for the leprechaun's little jig in the wearing of the grin [1951], where Porky goes to Ire- land. Q: There are so many disciplines just in terms of timing - the way Bugs Bunny walked must have been mathematically exact. A: Sure, but the basic thing in animation is that you're talking about believability. You see, I was dealing with the idea of realism first, but then I realized that be- lievability was much more important. So that with Bugs or any other character, it was the feeling of weight that mattered. One of the best examples of this is puppets or marionettes: they seem to work best if their knees don't bend when their feet touch the ground. Otherwise, they look all wrong, because there's no suggestion of gravity there. So I discovered that if you get the feeling of weight, you're all right - it doesn't really make much differ- ence whether it's realistically drawn or not. Q: In other words, the values become less literal and more abstract. A: Sure. If you want it loose, if you want it buoyant, if you want it inflated like a balloon - well, go ahead and make it like a balloon. But if my decision is that it's a Bugs Bunny story - then Bugs has a par- ticular weight. So I want him to feel, as he walks across a room, as if he has this given density, this given solidity. Q: Unless he's pulling himself out of a hat, à la case of the missing hare [1942]. A: Ah ha! But even then, pulling your- self out of a hat has a feeling of weight, as you lift yourself up. This feeling of weight and believability can even be offscreen, as in duck amuck [1953] and rabbit rampage [1955]. Q: Certain themes started emerging the very first year you began to direct. In doggone modern [1938], those two early dogs of yours, the boxer and his puppy pal, were pitted against the absurdities of technology, much as all those "Acme" de- vices would later backfire on the Coyote in his quest for the Roadrunner. The two dogs got trapped in a modernistic house - of- the - future. A: That's right. They wandered in, and the place had a robot broom that would sweep up anything, regardless of what it was. Q: And the dogs had to dodge the robot broom, to keep from getting swept up themselves. You did a remake of the same film about a decade later, this time starring your mice characters Hubie and Bertie [house hunting mice, 1947], which seems to be such an incredible improvement on the original doggone modern. A: Well, the style of background was completely different in the two cartoons. In the first few pictures I worked on, we used a man by the name of Griff Jay, who was an old newspaper cartoonist - and he did what we'd call "moldy prune" back- grounds. Everybody used the same type of thing back then - Charlie Johnston drew backgrounds for Tex Avery, and he was an old newspaper cartoonist too. Q: But the biggest difference between the two films is in the starring characters. The situation is the same, a pair of charac- ters being victimized by the crazy elec- tronic house devices, but Hubie and Bertie in house hunting mice are active and fully developed characters, while the dogs are far too passive - they just don't have a chance. A: No, they don't. The dogs don't really amount to anything. They just walk around and get mixed up in all the gadgetry. But they don't demonstrate any real human reactions, none that we can recognize anyway, beyond a sort of generalized anxiety. The characters aren't really established, so you don't care about the, You do care about Hubie and Bertie, though. Q: They're real personalities. It's so much more exhilarating to see them re- spond to the machinery, occasionally react against it, and at odd times even triumph over it. There's a marvelous sequence where Hubie and Bertie succeed in tem- porarily outfoxing the robot, remember? Unlike the two dags, they finally realize that this fucking broom is going to whiz out and sweep up the debris, regardless of purpose, and so, this time, the characters make use of the fact and consciously try to wear the robot out. They turn on an au- tomatic record ejector that shoots out discs Inki and the Mynah Bird in CAVEMAN INKI (1950). and shatters them against the wall, the records fly and break into pieces, and the robot, invariably, has to come out and sweep up, again and again. Also, there are shots, with the simulated editing, of a mis- sile sailing past intercut with a quick insert of a character, just watching it go by. A: That may have been generated from a fascination with tennis matches, and such intercutting effects would often make the scene work. It also demonstrates that you could get an object to look like it's moving a hell of a lot faster with editing. And eventually, I began to add shadows of the missile flying past; this happened very often in the "Roadrunner" films. Q: Most memorably, when you get an insert close-up of the Coyote, with a truck or train heading right for him, the shadow of it going over his face, and he's holding up a little sign that says "STOP, IN THE NAME OF HUMANITY," or something like that. A: Of course you realize that all our stuff was pre-edited; it had "simulated edit- ing," as you say. The editing was all in the director's head. A lot of people don't realize that, so it's interesting and well worth emphasizing. This wasn't necessar- ily true of Disney, but we didn't actually physically cut our stuff at all. The directors here developed the ability to bring in a car- toon within ten seconds of its proper length. It's easier to do this on a spot- gag picture that it is on a story picture, of course. It was really mental editing, and I've never met a live -action director, or editor, who understood how this could be done. It's just like shooting these little clips of film in live-action, at exactly their proper length, and putting them all together. And An original Culhane's sketch of the lion, with emphasis on hind legs, in INKI AND THE LION (1941). I I o CO &lt;D c ra Ž LT) IX O"» 3 this was the necessity of the situation, since we weren't allowed any retakes. We weren't allowed to cut. We only had so much footage, and we had to do it right the first time. We did retakes in the sense that we'd re-animate something, if it was wrong, but we never re-filmed. Q: One thing puzzles me: Treg Brown | occasionally gets a "film editor's" credit. Usually he is credited as a sound -effects man. 24 JAN.-FEB. 1975 I</page><page sequence="5">The Mynah Bird and Inki, by Chuck Jones. A: Right, the "film editor's" credit also refers to sound- effects; he was a sound ef- fects cutter. He deserved his credit thoroughly, since he was one of the most brilliant sound -effects editors that ever lived. Q: Your cartoons have more of this simu- lated, live -action -type editing than any other cartoon director's. In the middle of one of the "Roadrunner" chases, the cam- era angles switch rapidly from pan shot, to a dose -up of the Coyote, to an overhead vantage, etc. Nobody at Warners did this kind of thing more frequently, except pos- sibly Frank Tashlin. Friz Freleng, on the other hand, seemed to opt more for an illu- sion of "stage space," as if the characters were performing live on a stage platform. You often revert to close-ups, reaction shots, and even very subtle uses of subjec- tive view points; Freleng goes for single -takes. A: It sounds like an observation that you'd be able to make more accurately than I could. I don't see my old pictures too regularly, and I never think of them in terms of cutting. Q: Another thing wrong with the two early dogs that appeared in doggone modern and a couple of other films at the time: there seemed to be some question as to what movements were defined for them. They were very naturalistically drawn, but their movements seemed to confuse human -like and canine actions. A: That's why there wasn't any character, because what we were trying to do was to find out how the hell a dog moves. Just how he moves, and nothing much beyond that. That's when I was fighting the anthropomorphic idea of movement. They were modeled with back-legs like dogs, but nobody really knew how to move them properly. The re- sult was that they looked rather awkward. One very pivotal film for me was inki and the lion [1941], where Shamus Culhane, one of the all-time great animators, finally got that lion to work - then Manny Färber wrote in New Republic that he thought the lion looked like Robinson Crusoe. Anyway, we had to go through the process of anatomy first, in things like doggone modern, so that the later dogs still gave the impression of being dogs, but weren't drawn exactly like dogs and didn't move exactly like dogs. Marc Antony in feed the kitty [1952] and cat feud [1959] certainly appeared to be a dog, but he moved according to the anatomy we had established for him. He was over- weight in front, and had a tiny behind. Q: And the frisky puppy in terrier stricken [1952] and two's a crowd [1951] was a natural -looking four- legged puppy. But his friskiness is just beyond the realis- tic. There came to be a very thin line for you, then, between the realistic and the slightly exaggerated. A: Oh yes, a real dog might do other things than what this puppy does, but the puppy's basic characteristic is this fastness. So that's what I take off on and accent: that incredibly quick movement. He comes sliding in, barking like crazy, all ears, arms, and legs. Q: And the squirrel in much ado about nutting [1953] is also a natural -seeming squirrel . . . A: Technically, that's one of the best pic- tures I ever made. I studied squirrels just to find out how they moved; they turn their heads in almost one frame and then they hesitate as they look - like a bird, they don't have binocular vision. I love those lit- tle hesitations when he's looking around and sniffing. If the surrealistic ending worked it was because everything was so normal up to that time. The cocoanut was simply impossible to break, and when it did break there was another one beneath it. Q: Just one ordinary squirrel setting out to crack an extraordinarily uncrackable nut. And he tries everything: sawing it, exploding it, riveting it. A: That was a difficult picture to do. It was such a simple gag; it's almost idiotic in it's simplicity. No dialogue, of course. But when he tried to crack the cocoanut by pushing it off the Empire State Building - that was the sequence that gpt me. He starts pushing the cocoanut up all those flights of stairs, and I'm so sad for him when he has to push it up each stair individually, then scramble up the next stair and push it again, and so on. EMOTIONAL NUANCE; FACIAL DETAIL Q: What struck you as most impressive in Buster Keaton's repertoire of physical gags? A: He often moved like he was being pulled away - he'd doubletake as though someone were yanking him by the back of his collar. The classic scene of all is where he actually was dragged off - in cops, I be- lieve. There were these hundreds of cops chasing him, right behind him; a streetcar goes by and Keaton just reaches out and grabs it and it pulls him off-screen. Q:There's a gag like that in zoom and bored, where the Coyote's foot gets caught in the rope of the harpoon that he's just shot off. He's struggling to unsnarl his foot and finally succeeds, but then realizes that he's left mid-air over one of those ter- rible thousand-foot drops. So at the last second he grabs for the end of the harpoon rope, still zipping by - and he's yanked off in the way you described that Keaton bit. I seems to me you were influenced even more by Keaton than Chaplin. A: I would think so, because my stuff is a little broader than Chaplin's, although the early Chaplin is quite broad, too. Chaplin originated those funny little hoppy runs and turns, where he bounces up and down a bit while rounding a corner. I'd use that a lot; I thought it always looked funny and strange because it wasn't at all neces- sary, physically. It was redundant. Simi- larly, Chaplin's surprised reactions were always comically over- elaborated. He'd jump up into the air and then come down and then start to run. The jump is solely a method of registering excitement and realization. He'd look like a human exclamation point, calling attention to his surprise - like saying, "Ah! I'm sur- prised!" - and then he'd run. Since they had no other means to express it, they'd do it with physical action, and it was beautiful to watch. Q: You seem to have a special interest in eyes. A: Oh yes. That's another thing I picked up from Keaton - those little eye-flicks to- ward the camera, which I'd use, say, whenever the Coyote realizes that some- thing is inevitably going to fall on him and the action stops for a moment. Of course, FILM COMMENT 25</page><page sequence="6">CHUCK JONES CONTINUED that was always used in the early Tom Mix Westerns, too, during a tense poker game - everything would be stockstill in the frame except that the eyes, in close-up, would be flickering back and forth, left and right. I found that you could get a laugh from any of these minimal movements. Like in terrier stricken, you hear the mistress off- screen telling the cat to take care of Frisky, the little puppy. Claude Cat has a devilish smirk on his face, of course, but we got the laugh from just his tiny eye- movement from side to side. Q: Often you bring the whites together so that the two eyes are joined, to indicate a character's surprise. A: That just seems to make the surprise dramatically stronger. I might take one eye up and even make the other one square under certain conditions. I found that once they're accepted as eyes, you can do any- thing with them to get strong effects. Tex Avery used them so that the eyes would shoot out approximately six feet, then fall on the floor, etc. I never went quite that far. Q: You did, just once in a special case - HOPALONG casualty [1961], when the Coyote reads that Earthquake Pills aren't effective on roadrunners. A: I usually use such extremes only for strong reactions, as when the Coyote is amazed at the Roadrunner's speed and his jaw drops straight to the ground. But then he immediately picks it up and shoves it back into its proper place. I wanted to get his startlementat the Roadrunner's speed. Q: Those movements seem to suspend time, like when the construction worker in one froggy evening [1956] finds the sing- ing frog in the cornerstone, and gives a prolonged look of disbelief at the audience, or when the Coyote is scheming and one of his ears simply flaps over. A: I don't know how long those move- ments take, but when I use them, you see, it's simply a matter of conspiring with the audience. Q: Sometimes you suspend all action for a moment as beads of sweat start forming on a character's forehead - like when the guy in one froggy evening is showing the frog to the agent and is worried whether or not it'll sing. A: In the earlier cartoons we'd have a heavier profusion of sweat for an anxious character. But in the Fifties we learned that just one or two beads looked better. Q: Another one of my favorite instances of this time -marking animation occurs in bully for bugs [1953] when the proud matador looks at the camera, doesn't move for a time, then simply flares one of his nostrils. A: That's a caricature of Juan Belmonte, one of the great bullfighters. He looked like that and was every bit as vain. And then I put in him what I would feel under the same circumstances - that is, fear - once he's face to face with the bull. So he's dressed for the part, but he wasn't really the brave matador. Q: But in terms of facial detail, I'd have to pinpoint feed the kitty [1952] for its gamut- running of facial expressions. A: Of course, that was a very sentimen- tal picture. Q: The tough bulldog falls hard for a tiny black kitten . . . A: The dog starts out pugnaciously with the cat but then runs the entire gamut of a relationship with anyone. It's like a girl, you know, when you first meet her: then you gradually get so that you can stand her and then you fall in love with her, then you become obsessed with her and fear she's going to die or something. And that is what the dog went through: he was a very protective character. I got involved with that bloody dog, Mark Antony: his panic when he thinks the cat is going to die, his efforts to look nonchalant when he's trying to cover up for the cat. The drawings in that cartoon were a lot of fun. GRAVITY, VELOCITY, AND THE RE- LATION OF FOREGROUND TO BACKGROUND Q: What are your favorite effects to show, say, the force of gravity in cartoons? You often use those straight -on shots of the Coyote in the midst of a fall, and differ- ent parts of his body fall at different times. A: Well, that was an old trick of mine to emphasize the idea of falling. A good ex- ample of this in actual nature - one that always infuriated me - is when a red light changes. Why doesn't everybody move at once? But they don't: the first car moves, then the second takes its movement from the first, and so on, and yet supposedly it is possible that they could all start at once. To me it was funny to apply the same princi- ple to a living body, so that the Coyote's trunk would drop away, and then his face and stretched -out neck would still be there, then the head would drop, leaving the ears, and then the ears'd drop off. Q: It prolongs the agony, too, having the Coyote involved feel each part of his body drop at different times, his expressions changing in the process. A: And yet when he lands, you know, it doesn't seem to hurt him any. It's usually just the idea of falling, the idea itself, which seems to carry the emotional impact. Q: Sometimes you have entire cartoons set up around the idea of gravity. In mouse wreckers [1948], for instance, you have a whole string of gravity gags, the coup de grâce being the upside-down room se- quence. A: An earlier gravity gag in that cartoon is when Claude Cat is pulled through the house by the rope, which is triggered by the mice pushing the heavy boulder off the chimney. And remember? Claude would get pulled into stacks of dishes, around bannisters, under tables. Gravity is the The frisky puppy, his fastness emphasized, in NO BARKING (1954). Ü c cD I m ¡D c ra io o*&gt; © simplest thing to use if you don't happen to have any other tools at hand. I have a running gag I want to do sometime - picking up on the image of the Big Spring, and making an entire cartoon about it. The Coyote could just get caught up in the spring, then later it could just bounce him along, then he could get caught up in it again, and it would just keep going. Then he could fall off the edge of a cliff and one end of the spring could catch on top of the cliff, and then he'd get down to the end of the spring, and there'd be an outcropping and he'd grab the out- cropping. And then he'd spring back to the top and he'd pull the outcropping up and that would drive him down again. Because when something compresses, it has to go in the opposite direction - it's cause and effect. And so, you see, just this spring, combined with gravity, would be all you'd need in terms of motive power. Q: How would that cartoon end, just in the middle of the action? A: I don't know how I'm ever going to end it, but it would obviously end up in a situation that implies a continuum, where the action goes right back where you started from. That "Here we go again!" kitsch. We might even use a spring wipe for the ending, going off in the distance or just falling away from the camera. Q: Mouse wreckers seems to us to be a major cartoon because of the controlling factors of the film are always kept off- screen.

The mice reconstruct his entire room, and when Claude wakes up, he doesn't know whether these things are really happening or whether he's hal- lucinating it all. A: In the later M-G-M remake, year of the mouse [1965], the cat finally realizes that the mice are provoking these disas- ters, and at the end he catches the mice. Q: Yeah, it's a moral ending, where the earlier Warners film has an immoral end- ing. A: Oh, well, I like immoral endings better. Forgetting the Tom and Jerry, the purpose in mouse wreckers was that the cat never realized exactly what was hap- pening to him. And it was based on an ac- tual happening. This upside- down room did exist: some English duke or something has a weird sense of humor, and at his par- ties, when someone would pass out, he'd haul 'em in there and everyone would look through the holes in the walls and watch them come to. And people would do ex- actly what the cat did: they'd try to crawl up the wall or something - particularly someone with a dreadful hangover, you can imagine how hideous that was. Q: The second -to -last image of that car- toon is amazing. It's just Claude's eyes, with the cat being driven totally insane, cowering at the top of a tree, and the leaves falling away just enough to reveal those eyes. A: In that picture I used a different thing: the eyes were handled almost like a pair of animated breasts - did you notice that? Q: Yes, the pupil came out of the ball of the eye, like a nipple. The fear registered in Claude's eyes in amazing, as he looks from side to side. A: Phil Monroe did a good job on that. Q: When Claude is in the upside-down room, on the ceiling that he thinks is the floor, trying to keep his balance by digging his claws into the ceiling, the camera turns around and goes upside-down with Claude; it's fascinating. I wonder if you were trying to show the force of gravity through motion alone, and without the standard visual presentation of what's up and what's down. A: Well, Claude opened the bottle and the liquid flowed up, while if it were shown from your viewpoint it would naturally flow down. And I wanted to show what he felt. Actually, Charlie Chap- lin used something like that in the opening airplane sequence of the great dictator, when he's piloting his plane upside- down. And the same series of gags are in the Porky Pig cartoon jumpin' jupi- ter [1955] when they lose their gravity. There I didn't have to turn the camera around, obviously, since it was in outer space. I just used a little sign that read: "You are now entering a low gravity zone." Q: This brings us to another natural force. I was wondering about your means of expressing velocity on the screen. One of my favorite gimmicks is in bully for bugs: as the bull charges, it leaves dozens of hooves in mid- air behind it. Daffy's horse in drip -along daffy [1951] leaves hooves in its wake as well. You often use dust, as when the Coyote is lagging just behind the Roadrunner and is trying to pick up speed. A: Well, there again I'm giving the viewer something to hold onto, something to register the speed. A bow and arrow is a good example from real life. You pull the string back, and release the arrow, but the bow is there - except in a Daffy Duck car- toon. But the bow is there with its string vibrating and so, with these two things in combination, you still have something on the sicreen after the arrow is gone. Here, what's important is what's left over: the catapults in my cartoons are shown the same way, they give you a reference - point. Q: There's an early Daffy Duck cartoon called Conrad the sailor [1941] which had very pronounced experimentation with ways of presenting speed. You actu- ally had the running characters leave ghost- images behind them, which would then catch up with the solid characters. I also remember a prominent use of matched cutting in that cartoon. Well, we used a lot of overlapping graphics on that particular cartoon, so that one scene would have the same graphic shape as an earlier scene, even though it would be a different object: first we'd show a gun pointing up in the air, then in the Original sketch for the Coyote in READY, SET ZOOM! (1955). ® 1975 Warner Brothers, Inc. ^COURTESY JOE ADAMSON S a; 0 m ai c 1 m i' FILM COMMENT 27</page><page sequence="8">The gamut-running of bulldog Mark Antony's facial expressions when confronted with the kitten in FEED THE KITTY (1952). CHUCK JONES CONTINUED next shot, there' d be a cloud in exactly the same shape. It gave a certain stability which we used in many of the cartoons after that. John McGrew was the artist re- sponsible for that sort of thing. Conrad was also the one where we used the first complete 360-degree turn, when the characters went up through the air. Q: Conrad and Daffy are being chased through the air by a torpedo, and they go around full circle. A: The fields themselves did not turn all the way around. The field only made a par- tial turn. The effect was accomplished tirely by changing the shape of the clouds. The clouds were the main thing. So when you saw it, it looked like you made one complete revolution - we started at one end looking down on a battleship and at the other end you were looking down at the same battleship again. It was a very tricky problem; I'm not sure it was worth it. Q: You've used the same basic technique since, as when the camera seems to do a 180- degree tilt. In mouse wreckers, when Claude is being pulled through the drain- pipe, you must have drawn the drainpipe so that it bulged out in the middle and ta- pered off at either end, to allow for the perspective -change during the camera movement. A: Yeah, that's exactly what we did. We used it before in an early "Sniffles" car- toon. In fact, that's one of few tricks we originated that Disney took from us - remember the perspective trick when the alligator comes slithering down that pole in "Dance of the Hours" [from fantasia]? Anyway, John McGrew was a great student of film techniques. And oddly enough, much of the staging in Conrad the sailor was taken from Eisenstein' s writing. It had mostly to do with matched dissolves, with the relation of one shot to the next - so that one scene, formally, might be exactly the same as the previous one, even though the subject would change. Q: You have a transition like that in hold the lion, please [1941], one of your ear- liest Bugs cartoons, where this weakling schnook of a lion is claiming his status as "King of Beasts," and all the other animals in the jungle are laughing at him. The laughing animal faces in the first composi- tion dissolve into shrubs, flowers, and foliage, which serve as the background for the next shot. In regard to technical facilities at Warner Brothers, did you have a multiplane camera, or anything like it? A: No, we faked it a lot but we never had any such thing. I don't think any studio did except Disney's. Q: Sometimes, the Warners cartoons have at least two layers, moving in perspec- tive during a shot. A: Well, we could do that all right. Johnny Burton, who was in charge of pro- duction, was pretty damn good at man- euvering things around to get a three-dimensional effect, but all three layers would actually be on the same level as we were photographing them. He was very clever at working out the speed at which foreground material should go, in relation to a second layer. I've used as many as three layers to achieve certain ef- fects. Also, one of the reasons you'd use a foreground object, if you weren't cutting in the middle of a pan shot, is that your back- ground drawings would have to repeat - otherwise, they'd be on a mile -long sheet of paper. So you'd have to use a telephone pole to cover up the break between the first background and the du- plicate field. But finally, with the "Road- runners," say, this type of perspective didn't seem to count. We dropped it, since it just didn't seem necessary. The pans were so damned fast that the audience could never look at them too closely; other times, you'd get your speed and perspec- tive effects just by having a diminishing body in space. You see, if we couldn't achieve the idea of intense speed through the character drawings, there didn't seem to be much point in using added mechani- cal means. Q: In the later cartoons, you seem to use completely "slanted -over" backgrounds to accent the speed of the character. A: Well, that was Maurice Noble's idea. And he'd always take this opportunity to use a lot of interesting shapes - abstract curves and things of this sort, which gave a sort of depth feeling to it. But for the most part, we were trying to avoid forced or Italian perspective, which you'd establish by having the various buttes get progres- sively smaller into the background. Except for the road itself, we used almost none of this forced perspective. The buttes and desert landscape backgrounds were flat- tened out, more Japanese. Donald Graham, the dean of all art teachers for cartoonists, always said that cartoons were unique in the way they es- tablished space by movement. And he said that the "Roadrunner" series was the only case that he knew in which a form moved in "pure" space, where the space was achieved entirely by the form moving it. Q: That's certainly evident when you get those overhead -viewpoints of the Coyote falling off a cliff. He falls straightaway from the camera, isolated against a completely blank background, diminishing, then dis- appearing for a time until - poof! - he's been reduced to a puff of dust on the ground below. Are there any antecedents to that? In super rabbit [1943], Bugs Bunny is flying along and is about to "re- charge his batteries," but then accidentally loses all his fortified, super- vitamized car- rots, and he falls to earth at that point - a beautifully animated fall. In style and cam- era angle, it seems to anticipate the Coyote's later falls. A: That was animated by Ken Harris, and it was very similar to all the Coyote's later falls. Ken added that "loose -limbed" feeling to the action. Q: In one case you used the same back- ground in two cartoons: the "Electric Eye" that was in both duck dodgers in the 241/* century [1953] and rocket squad [1956]. A: Yes, that giant mechanical bloodshot eyeball suspended from the ceiling. I liked the shape of it, and it went so fast that I thought it would be fun to use it again. It was designed by Maurice Noble. He created most of the space-age gadgetry for those films. Maurice also invented that rocket squad "Evaporator": the character would step into a weird test-tube glass contraption and ZAP! disappear and re- materialize somewhere else. In that case, Maurice worked ahead of me on the story and originated that contraption. Q: There is always a very marked con- trast between foreground and background in your cartoons. Would you say that you say that you generally gave more leeway to your background artists than other direc- tors might? A: Yeah, I did - you see, what I did was to draft a very rough plan, just to show the layout man what I wanted. Now, if I put in a doorway, say, all I wanted was room for 28 JAN. -FEB. 1975</page><page sequence="9">® 1 975 Warner Brothers, Inc. the character to exit; I didn't care what the doorway looked like, beyond that. Maurice would take my layouts - let's say there'd be ten layouts for the scene - then he'd make a sort of mise- en-scene that de- fines the limits of the character action. He'd find the layout that goes the furthest to the right, the one that goes the furthest to the left, the deepest one, the closest one, and generally planned where most of the action would have to fall. He'd take all these separate layouts and put them all in one drawing, and then design the back- ground around it. He'd also take into con- sideration what was happening in the story - which very few background men ever do. Generally speaking, the fore- ground characters were all mine, but Maurice would also often design back- ground characters which were visually very strong, like those Baroque -looking French bystanders in the later Pepe le Pew cartoons. Now, in the "Roadrunner" series, we almost never used color for emphasis. But in a more overtly experimental picture like from a to zzzz [1954], we had a scene in a boxing ring, we flashed to a completely red background at the punch, which then quickly diminished. There was a lot of high contrast stuff in that cartoon. But the most outstanding example of Maurice's acheiv- ing mood with his backgrounds was what's opera doc? [1957]. Of all the people I've worked with, Maurice was probably the most influential. Maurice was a brilliant designer, and very often people give Phil DeGuard credit for design, since the credit roster would say "Backgrounds by Phil DeGuard." Phil was an excellent follow-up man, certainly, and he's a fine painter, but he bears the same relationship to the layout man, in prepar- ing a picture, that a contractor does to an architect in constructing a building. Q: What about John McGrew's style and approach, as compared with Noble's? A: John McGrew didn't really have a style; he was experimenting all the time. Maurice does have a style. John McGrew, you might say, was more of an intellectual. You could be intellectual, and get away with it . . .but if you're solely intellectual as a director, you weren't going to get away with it. The result was, however, that he goosed me into thinking that it might be worthwhile to try some different things with backgrounds, and so forth. And later on, I would find this kind of thing very useful, in that often it would make your gag work, and sometimes you wouldn't even know why. Like that little abstract background at the end of duck amuck, with the sharply angled lines going off. Q: There's a similar design in aristo -cat [1943], where abstract linear shapes serve as an expression of the character's mood - an almost laughably superabundant expression. This süly pa- trician cat is helpless when his butler walks out, so the cat goes running terrified through the mansion, screaming out "Meadows!" in a series of takes, each one with a new wallpaper design in the back- ground, directly reflecting the cat's feel- ings. A: That was McGrew. He was deeply in- terested in the emotional effects you could get from those jagged red and white lines in the wallpaper. It's quite jarring. So, even though we were working with just a silly little cat, we wanted it to appear as though he were really in a state of panic. MICROCOSM/MACROCOSM- JONES' SENSE OF MINIATURIZATION Q: I love the monumental prelude of caveman iNKi [1950], your last cartoon with Inki and the Mynah Bird. It's crazy how the Mynah Bird, a tiny creature, is as- sociated with mountains crumbling, the earth shaking, natural catastrophes that terrified all the larger animals. A: Oh, they weren't terrified of the Mynah Bird, but they were terrified of the natural condition that arose from the Mynah Bird's appearance. The mountain split right in half, remember? Everyone ex- pects something pretty tremendous, and then this little thing comes out. Q: Isn't this a recurrent theme? You fre- quently show these violent contrasts be- tween very small characters and their envi- ronments. It's visible in your early tom thumb in trouble [1940], which features little Tom taking a bath in his father's cupped hands. It's also operative in your early Porky cartoons - porky's ant and porky's midnight matinee [both 1941] - that co-star an African pygmy ant. Then in to itch his own [1958], years later, there's your flea, the Mighty Angelo, who wants to settle down on some nice quiet dog in the country. A lot of directors have used size deformation, but differently. Clampett's tiny characters are often de- signed to convey smallness and cuteness, with heads and rumps large in propor- tion to the rest of their bodies. Similarly, when Avery magnifies his characters in king-size canary [1947], their shapes change to convey largeness - their stom- achs distend grotesquely out of propor- tion. But when you shrink or enlarge a character, their anatomies retain their orig- inal proportions. It's less like biological nightmare, and more like a sort of absurd displacement. Your pugnacious flea, the Mighty Angelo, looks like a perfectly proportioned circus he-man. A: As a sort of lay physicist, I've always been fascinated by the peculiar perfection of tiny things. When I was a kid, there was a general assumption that things which were very small were imperfect. Large houses were fine, while a grain of sand was nothing. But the more I became ac- quainted with this, by reading Sir James Jeans and Isaac Asimov and other popularizers of science, the more I realized that it wasn't a matter of perfection or im- perfection. Long after that, I finally got along to the DNA molecule. The most per- fect thing and the most misunderstood thing is the DNA molecule. And then, on the other hand, you have infinities that no one can possibly understand either. So you begin to wonder if there isn't some kind of big loop that hooks them together - perfection/imperfection, small size/large size, microcosm/macrocosm. Each "opposite" is really the same thing looked at from a different viewpoint. If I'd been a physicist, I would probably have hooked into it in another way; or if I had been a novelist, I probably would have tried to write something like O'Brien's The Diamond Lens , which was preoccupied with the same idea. I did read it when I was young, and it probably had something to do with my later work. At the time, the idea of a story like that seemed ridiculous. But now we know it's far from ridiculous. Horton hears a who [1971] was a good example of a microcosm/macrocosm rela- tionship, and it also contained the "person's-a-person- no- matter- how-small" idea, which, I agree, is also represented in things like porky's ant. Q: It's interesting how long you've kept FILM COMMENT 29 1</page><page sequence="10">CHUCK JONES CONTINUED this concern, and how images from your earlier films spring up again in the later ones, in altered ways. Your early black- and-white JOE GLOW THE FIREFLY [1941] has a firefly scooting around the face of a sleep- ing camper, walking the part in the guy's hair; and the camper's mouth, twitching in sleep, creates a major earthquake for Joe. Years later, you do this again in beanstalk bunny [1955] with the same kind of im- mense close-ups on a human head, as Bugs and Daffy are running around the Giant Elmer Fudd's ears, nose, and mouth. It's a weird, almost Swiftian image. A: The Swiftian connection is exactly right, because I remember those descrip- tions of enormous pores and things that Gulliver saw, the enormous size of the hairs, and how gross it was when he was on a woman's breast. Q: The humor of these change-of-scale effects seems to be based on taking a character who's tailor-made for largeness, whose very drawing style and body-structure suggests largeness, and shrinking it - like the tiny bulldog in your late "Tom and Jerry7' cartoon the cat's me-ouch [1965], who had those wild flash- ing teeth that tore through all the other characters. A: Yeah, that little piranha dog! He was really a shrunken version of the big bull- dog, Marc Antony. Q: Or, most especially, your miniature elephant who "terrorizes a large metropolis" in punch trunk [1954]. A: That had to be a real elephant; it couldn't even be a cartoon elephant. It wouldn't have worked at all unless it was a real elephant. You had to establish it as a perfect miniature - and the people who see it as real people - or else their response wouldn't count. If we had used an an- thropomorhized elephant, there wouldn't have been any shock value to it, and you wouldn't have believed it. Q: Not all the people who see the elephant are surprised by it, though. A: No, but that's the idea. Some people live with fantasy every day of their lives. The drunk, you remember, staggers out, sees the elephant, and takes it calmly - just looks at his watch and says, "You're late!" The little girl who lives in the penthouse accepts it as a new toy, while the people who trade on "sanity" - such as the par- ents of the little girl or, later on, the psy- chiatrist - are terrified. Q: Technically, the movements of the elephant are so fluid. It's as if you were using the same number of drawings that you would if you were animating a large elephant. A: Yes - in fact, I would say we used more drawings. We used a real elephant cry on the soundtrack, too. The same thing, in a different area, is the bull in bully for bugs. The bull had to be believable as a bull: he had to present the same terror and probability of injury to Bugs as he would to you. And that's why I showed that first man facing the bull, the Juan Belmonte caricature, before Bugs even got into the story - if he's afraid of the bull, well, poor Bugs. But that's the trick, I think, if you're going to do miniaturization: you've got to make your audience really believe that such a thing is possible. Of course if you'd ask Eddie Seltzer, our producer, he'd say, "You should us e fewer drawings for a god- dam little elephant!" Q: The same thing seems to work, in re- verse, with that little puppy you had in terrier stricken and no barking [1954]. His motions and anatomy are tailor-made to convey smallness and friskiness. And yet, with the same type of funny perverse- ness, you took that character, in the 3-D cartoon lumberjack bunny [1955], and made him into a giant - casting him as Paul Bunyan's dog. A: Right, his movements are frisky. When you look at a puppy, at the time he first stops being an infant and becomes what you'd call an adolescent puppy, well, his movements are very quick. They stand there posed, ready for action, looking at you and trying to provoke you - so their movements are very cleancut and sharp. DISNEY Q: I'd like to talk about your attitude to- ward Disney. Not only the person of course, but all the associations one has with the Disney name. In your cartoons, Disney seems to be a simultaneous inspira- tion and exasperation. A: Well, I know I exasperated him a lot. You see, the three little pigs established the whole idea of character animation. Be- fore that, there wasn't such a thing. The cartoon with the grasshopper and the ant, and others they did in the Thirties were the progenitors of the whole idea of character animation. And Bugs Bunny, of course, is finally the offspring of Max Hare from Disney's tortoise and the hare - that was the first pure speed cartoon as well. Q: It certainly seemed to influence you a great deal. A: And it's still pretty hard to beat. And band concert [1935] was superb, but it wasn't as quite as strong a development as three little pigs. The three pigs looked alike, but had completely different per- sonalities. You might say that they were the beginnings of the Seven Dwarfs, who all looked similar but all had different per- sonalities. Q: The band concert expresses charac- ter conflict in terms of musical conflict in the same way that your long-haired hare [1948] does. Donald plays "Turkey in the Straw7' on his fife, interfering with Mickey, who's trying to conduct the William Tell Overture. You have Bugs Bunny strumming a banjo, anchbelting "What Do They Do on a Rainy Night in Rio?," while your opera-singer, Giovanni Jones, is trying to sing an aria. A: I don't know if there was any con- scious relation to the Disney picture, but in general you'd have to say that in terms of the tools supplied to those who followed him, Disney was to animation what Grif- fith was to live action. Almost all the tools were discovered at Disney's; they were the only ones who had the money, and who could and did take the time to experiment. Donald Graham gave lectures to future animators at Disney's. There was one on distant action and one on secondary action - secondary action being those in- stances when a character comes to a sud- den stop and his hair moves out on its own, without the volition of the character. A primary action is when you move your head, and a secondary action is what hap- pens to your hairset. 30 JAN. -FEB. 1975</page><page sequence="11">Q: That's certainly very evident in FANTASIA. A: In 'The Sorceror's Apprentice" se- quence there was a tremendous amount of secondary action because Mickey was fit- ted in such a big costume that when he stopped the suit would swirl around him. Of course, I used this a lot in the "Road- runner" series as the bird stops and the dust continues to go by. Q: Despite the obvious influences that Disney has had on your cartoons, many of them seem to satires or parodies of Disney. A: Right. Well, Disney himself never went in for satire. I don't think he under- stood it very well, what's opera, doc? can be looked upon as a satire of fantasia. I never made a cartoon which didn't contain some flick- of- the- wrist at the establish- ment of the day; the Disney people seldom did that, of course. Q: broomstick bunny [1956] changes the concept into who's the ugliest one of all instead of who's the fairest one of all, à la SNOW WHITE. A: The witch in broomstick bunny was so afraid of getting pretty, and she tried to get rid of Bug's ugliness. Q: It has a great deal of abstract variation on Bugs' usual character shape. At the end he looks like a stick with a head stuck on top, and the head is almost nothing but eyes as Bugs makes with that ultimate pathetic expression. A: My characters often used the exag- gerated "soulful eyes" with the gooey, oversized centers - the "old soulful eyes routine" - to get themselves out of a jam. I think I first used that in a "Charlie Dog" cartoon, little orphan airedale [1947]. THE "ROADRUNNER" SERIES; 'WOLF AND SHEEPDOG" SERIES; JONES' 'TOM AND JERRY" Q: I'd like to talk about the rules and dis- ciplines you applied to individual series. You said in Psychology Today that the more rules you applied to the "Roadrunner" series, for instance, the funnier the films were. A: Well, if you sit down to paint a pic- ture, and you spread out on a table every color you can buy in a paint store, you'll find it very difficult to select the color that will be of any use to you. But if you take arbitrarily, say, yellow or green or a par- ticular shade of blue, you can paint a pretty good picture - because the fact of painting a picture depends more on you and not so much on the tools available. You can paint a very good picture of a green meadow without any green paint. You might sub- stitute white for green and then surround it with brown, using colors very sparingly. It will still look springlike. Everyone I've ever respected always used restricted tools. The greatest come- dians were the ones who wore the sim- plest costumes and worked in prescribed areas - such as Chaplin. So it just became evident after a while that the narrower the discipline in the "Roadrunner" series - for instance, that there was no dialogue, that the Roadrunner wouldn't hurt the Coyote, and that the Coyote would be victimized by his own ineptitude - the better it got. Q: Could you compare the "Roadrun- ner" series with the "Tom and Jerry" series which you took over in 1964? They seem similar enough that there might be some overlap in concept. A: I wasn't really at home with the Tom and Jerry characters. Hanna-Barbara han- dled those characters beautifully, much better than I did. Jerry was a much more charming character in their best cartoons than I could ever make him, simply be- cause I could never understand him. And I couldn't really draw Tom very well; I had to turn him into a different cat really. So I purposely said, "The hell with him." And I tried to keep Jerry attractive personally, more like the Roadrunner, in that he never really hurt Tom in my version. Bill and Joe's Jerry would sometimes cut Tom into slices. It became sort of half-assed with my Tom becoming a combination of the Coyote and the original Tom. It's difficult to work with someone else's characters. Q: You've used the same Coyote charac- ter in many different ways - which way do you think he operates best? A: The Coyote really represents three different characters: he's one character in the "Wolf and Sheepdog" series . . . Q: His name's Ralph, Ralph Wolf, and Miniaturization. From left: JOE GLOW THE FIREFLY (1941); PORKY'S MIDNIGHT MATINEE (1941); Mighty Angelo, the pug- nacious flea in TO ITCH HIS OWN (1958); Bugs with Frisky Puppy in LUMBERJACK BUNNY (1955); the Mighty Angelo, HORTON HEARS A WHO (1971). © íoysWamerfreiÂM as he and the sheepdog pass each other on the way to work, they punch in together at the timeclock . . . A: And they say, "Hello, Ralph," "Hello, Sam." So in the "Sheepdog" series he's one character, when he's work- ing with Bugs he's a completely different character, and when he's working with the Roadrunner he's a completely different character. He looks the same, I admit. I don't know, I liked the shape of him. It's like the same actor playing three different parts in live- action films. Q: Of course, there are elements of per- sonality that overlap from one series to another. The Coyote who works with Bugs Bunny is different because he has a voice and dialogue, but he's like the Coyote who chases the Roadrunner in his obses- sion with his own machinations. In operation: rabbit [1954], the Coyote draws up various inventions at a draftsman's table - "Plan One: Pressure Cooker; Plan Two: Explosive Decoy; Plan Three: Flying Saucer." He's obviously hung up with himself in a smug, self- congratulatory kind of way. A: The last scene in that was one of my all-time favorite gags. The Coyote is in the munitions shed, filling up Bugs' s carrots with nitroglycerin, complimenting himself on his idea, while behind him, through the window in the background, you see the train coming toward him. But the Coyote doesn't pay any attention; he just con- tinues screwing the carrot-tops back in place, and thinks he's so smart, saying to himself, "'WileE. Coyote: Super-Genius.' I like the way that rolls out - 'Wile E. Coyote: Super-Genius.'" This Coyote's a type of very shabby egotist, because he has that exaggerated self-confidence that he refuses to lose. Q: But isn't this trait carried over from the Coyote in the "Roadrunner" series, that same love for his own schemes and devices? A: Oh yeah, but the whole thing is changed. In the films with the Coyote and the Roadrunner, the entire situation is more desperate. The Coyote here isn't merely an egotist; he's almost possessed, he's a fanatic. And now I realize, it was only in the earlier cartoons that I made The bull in BULLY FOR BUGS (1953). ° 1 975 Warner Brothers, Inc. FILM COMMENT 31</page><page sequence="12">Below: Charlie Dog, by Chuck Jones. Above: The Coyote in LICKETY SPLAT (1961 ) and TO BEEP OR NOT TO BEEP (1964). CHUCK JONES CONTINUED much of a point about the Coyote wanting to eat the Roadrunner. Later on, even that didn't seem to matter any more, and the Coyote's motivation became even more generalized: all he wanted to do was get him, or something, because his dignity was shot. Q: And eventually, in the last of the series, even the Roadrunner bird himself seems superfluous to the series. For exam- ple, he hardly makes an appearance in to beep or not to beep [1964], as the Coyote spends more than half of the film trying to operate one single catapult, an instrument which was originally intended to get the bird. A: Right - the catapult itself achieves a sort of perverseness, a personality of its own. Q: There's a general difference between the "spot-gag" cartoons and the narrative cartoons. A: The difference is in the relationship of timing, pacing, and hitting the proper length for the film without going over the budget. If a spot-gag film was too long, you could just lift out a gag and save if for the next film. Q: But the "Roadrunner" films, though spot-gag films, are definitely structured works. They don't have a narrative struc- ture, but they're far more than strings of unrelated gags. A: I evolved a kind of rhythm to them, which sometimes had to do with planting a gag which reappear in a "poster ending" - in zoom and bored, for exam- ple. I'd have three or four of the Roadrunner's nerve-wracking "beep- beeps" at the opening, in rapid succession to prepare the audience for more. But by the end of the film the Coyote, poor bas- tard, was so shaken that I didn't have the heart to let the Roadrunner send him off the cliff. So when the Roadrunner comes up behind the Coyote, he holds up a sign saying "I DON'T HAVE THE HEART." Then sometimes, in other Roadrunner films, I'd use a different kind of running gag, a cumulative gag, like the dynamite cartoon . . . Q: You mean lickety splat [1961]? That one has the Coyote in a balloon, toward the beginning, unloosing these hundreds of flying dart-shaped dynamite sticks . . . A: Yeah, then at the end of every scene that followed afterward, one of the little darts, left over from this first gag, would come in and explode. Or sometimes I'd go through a number of very simple visual jokes, fast-like, saving a very long gag for the end, like when the Coyote swallows the Earthquake Pills in hopalong casualty. But there is a structure. It isn't, as it may appear in the beginning, a series of spot-gags without relationship to one another. I'd alternate, say, a gag which would let the audience in on what was going to happen, where the surprise might be in how it would happen, with a scene that would get a laugh from something that the audience couldn't have the re- motest idea would happen. Q: Explosions seem to be very important to you. There is a use of explosions in your work, more so than in the work of other animators, that releases a lot of the tension which results from the extreme pacing. A: That's probably true - I got to a point where I needed something to release all this tension. But also, to me, an explosion is best used not as a dramatic device in it- self but as a point or an idea in the comic sequence. An example is the cartoon where the Coyote built a fantastic, long trough up the side of the mountain [zoom and bored]. You didn't know what he was going to do with it, but the camera panned up and you saw all the work he put into it and how delicately the trough was bal- anced on the rocks. By the time the camera finally got to the top and the Coyote lit the fuse to the dynamite, it wasn't even proper to let the fuse burn down. The second the Coyote lit the match, the whole thing ex- ploded. BOOM!! Immediately. The humor is not in the explosion at all, but in the fact that the guy obviously worked for hours and hours and weeks and weeks on the damn trough. A.C. Gamer, who did some of the best special effects we had, concocted a big, beautiful explosion with curlicues and stars splaying out. It was a marvelous thing, and it was based on a discovery we made around the time of draft horse: that there were mechanics to an explosion we hadn't know about. Before, we always supposed that an explosion would go out fast, so we'd make a small drawing, and then a bigger one, and then a bigger one, taking maybe three frames to spread out. Well, when you think about it, you realize that it couldn't conceivably be that way, because each frame was one-twenty- fourth of a second. This meant that it would take three-twenty-fourths of a sec- ond to get the full effect, which was far too much time. So, by studying some live- action explosions, we discovered that the brightest frame was the very first one. That became evident to everyone later, of course, with the documentary footage on atomic bomb explosions, which actually went all white at first, and then faded down a little bit until you began to see the mushroom. So what we would do was to i*"a5é ' Soulful ! eyes.

I later applied that principle to more minor, less violent actions: if some- one simply got socked in the jaw, the most extreme drawing would be the first one, and then we'd diminish it. Q: I'd like to know more about the less known but very remarkable "Wolf and Sheepdog" series. A: I got the idea for that series at about the same time I made a one-shot film with Mike Maltese called go fly a kit [1957]. There were these large-scale arguments going on, as to which was the more impor- tant conditioning factor: environment or heredity. Well, I would guess that both of them are important, and nobody really knows. But it got to the point where it was so idiotic - the young people were rearing their children either with all environment or all heredity in mind. I felt that, OK, it's absurd, so let's make it really absurd and go on the supposition that an adopted cat raised by an eagle would obviously be able to fly. The same thing would hold true for the "Wolf and Sheepdog" series, I thought. Just as human beings go to work, punch „ their cards down and become at that point, say, bus drivers - a bus driver isn't a bus driver on his way to work, he's only a bus driver then he gets in the bus. And I thought, if that's true of human beings, why can't it be true of animals? A snake isn't a snake until he goes and punches in in the morning. And a wolf and sheepdog could be very good friends, real buddies, up to the point that they punch in, the fac- tory whistle blows, and they do what they're being paid to do. Q: Once you mentioned that the "Road- runner" series began as a satire on the usual kind of character-conflict in car- toons, the Coyote being a purely intellec- tual and motivated character, while the Roadrunner bird is completely unmoti- vated, a natural or nearly supernatural character. You have a similar classic dichotomy here, with the Wolf and Sheepdog. And then there's the fact that the Wolf and Sheepdog are antagonists only after the whistle blows, which seems to indicate a satirization of typical cartoon character clashes. A: It may have been an underlying thing. Although in this case, you have one person with the object of protecting the sheep and this is the major difference in the series. You have the Wolf who wants to gather up the sheep, and the Sheepdog who wants to keep the sheep together. This is quite a different things from protect- ing yourself, which is the concept that the "Roadrunner" series dealt with. To me, it's a more sympathetic situation, and there- fore the means of protection could be a lit- tle more dramatic, a little stronger. And visually, come to thing of it, the Sheepdog is the exact opposite of the Roadrunner bird, who is very fast, while in this case the dog, who takes the same part, doesn't move at all. Q: He just appears on the cut, from no- where. A: Yes, with an almost magical quality. Q: And in this series, the Sheepdog ac- tively clobbers the Wolf all the time - it can get pretty severe. In steal wool [19 57], for example, the Wolf is squished pancake- flat and gets punched in the nose, leaving his snout accordian- crinkled. A: Maybe the fact that there was little ac- tion otherwise indicated that there should be stronger pieces of dramatic business than there would ever be in the Roadrunner-Coyote cycle, where you al- ways have plenty of action, even when nothing's really happening. A lot of my explanations are dependent on the stylistic problems that I was trying to solve at the time. Q: I find these cartoons very moving. They always suggested to me a kind of du- plicity involved in jobs, an alienation- from-self, the necessary compromises that people must make certain jobs - that sort of assumption of a disguise, within a dis- guise, within a disguise, within a disguise. The climax of this occurs in sheep in the deep [1962], where you pictorialized first a wolf in sheep's clothing, which turned out to be a sheepdog in wolf's clothing, which turned out to be a sheep in sheepdog's clo- thing, and so forth. A: Yes, I enjoyed that. It just kept going forever. But that really is always true, and in a way, I suppose, it's a sort of satire on ° 1975 Warner Brothers, Inc.

For instance, if two people walk into a room and one sits down behind a desk, the one person becomes the power, and the other person becomes the subject of that power. Q: This relationship is completely arbitrary - and how much did they change over the years? Not much, except that you eventually added a lunch-break for the warring characters. A: That's right. The beginning and the end of the cartoons remained the same, but employee conditions improved in the interim. PORKY PIG Q: How do you see Porky in relation to the other characters? A: Porky began as a child, and grew up along the way. But to decide what the dis- ciplines were with the Porky character is impossible. He tended to change with each series he appeared in. He was kind of square, I suppose; but you always felt, in a movie like duck dodgers in the 24V2 century, that he had his tongue in his cheek. There was always some sly aware- ness. For instance in duck dodgers, Daffy is so caught up in his crusade - his as- signment to find a supply of Aludium Phosdex, the shaving-cream atom - that by the end, he has succeeded only in ob- literating the entire alien planet and goes on to claim the remaining crumbling mound in the name of Earth. Then we pan down to Porky, hanging off the edge of the thing and saying "B-b-b-b-big deal!" Q: More often than not, you've used Porky as supporting-player rather than star. He's an "eager young space cadet" to Daffy's "Duck Dodgers." In the Westerns, he's even subtitled a "Comedy Relief to Daffy's "Western- type Hero," with little absurdist labels resembling the Latinate captions you always use for the Roadrun- ner and Coyote. A: I thought Porky was at his best as the "Fat Friar" in robin hood daffy [1958]. I did hundreds of layouts on that - I got so infatuated with that fat-assed character. That whole picture I enjoyed very much. Q: And it's very well designed. You once told me that you knew Eugene Pallette. A: Oh, yes, Pallette was a good friend of mine - he used to stay and live with us all the time. Of course we'd also see Fairbanks occasionally, and the mannerisms of these people would affect you, they were such strong personalities. I guess that helps, unconsciously. Actors like Flynn were real- ly holdovers from that earlier era. Flynn wasn't quite an original. Daffy was really parodying Fairbanks there, more than Flynn. Daffy's swashbuckling poses were exaggerations of the way that Fairbanks moved. His body had strong, dramatic ac- tions to it. Q: Pallette is very strongly evoked as Porky falls over laughing at Daffy's buf- foonery, out of control, with that great animation of his jelly-like stomach bound- ing, thumping up and down. A: And Daffy says, disgustedly, "How jolly can you get?" That stomach was good. Abe Levitow animated that. I'd say that that was his first really good piece of ani- mation. Q: I'm very fond of the horror-show- type series with Porky and Sylvester, where the character construction seems to be one of Sylvester's paranoia versus Porky Pig's complacency. My favorite is the second, claws for alarm [1955], where Sylvester is terrorized by these ras- cally mice armed with axes, chopping blocks, nooses, guillotines, but Porky re- mains entirely unaware and, through blindness or dumb luck, always emerges unharmed. A: There you have a very logical Porky - he's not a dope, but he's certainly very naive in the sense that he doesn't see what's happening. The cat is determined to protect him, and victimizes himself in the process. You might say that this is a variation of the "singing frog" situation, in that whatever happens, there's no evi- dence of it. This one guy had the privilege, or the curse, of seeing the singing frog, but when other people looked at it, it stopped doing its song-and-dance. In claws for alarm - as well as in the first in this series, scaredy cat [1948] - this poor cat is trying to save Porky's life all the time, but he always ap- pears to be taking Porky's life, poor devil. The lights go on, and there's Sylvester, caught in the midst of a protective act, but seeming to be the guilty party, holding the knife or razor blade to Porky's throat, while the guilty mice are hidden some- where. Somehow the funniest thing is that Porky isn't even alarmed by this - he doesn't believe Sylvester has the courage to do it. He sees Sylvester holding the razor, but he doesn't really take it seri- ously. He just says, "You psychopathical pussy ca - you psy chopa - you psy chopa - you manic-depressive cat, you." Porky's voice always drops at the end, I don't know why, so when you say "you cat, you," that little "you" at the end drops down about three notes. Q: In jumpin' jupiter, the last of the series, Porky and Sylvester are threatened by a fan- tastic Martian: a Dr. Suess-like bird, consisting entirely of smooth, curved lines. There's another Martian, in duck dodgers, with a WML Robin Hood Daffy and Porky, the "Fat Friar," in ROBIN Pepe Le Pew and his inamorata, by Chuck Jones. .HJOOD DAFFY (1958), by Chuck Jones.</page><page sequence="15">Roman Legion- type helmet, tennis shoes, and just a black circle for a head - no facial features at all except two large oval eyes.

You can convince people that the little Martian is speaking simply through the way he moves, and with that funny, meek Richard Haydn kind of voice - innocent, harmless, and saying things like "I'm going to blow up the Earth, as it obstructs my view of Venus/7 Q: It was a Porky cartoon that intro- duced Charlie Dog, that very aggressive mutt who feels that he has to ingratiate himself to a master. He continually finds unwilling masters, but keeps going to great lengths to find a home. In one car- toon, doggone south [1950], he tries to befriend a plantation owner and so adopts a Southern accent, eats chitterlings and compone, the whole works. In little or- phan airedale, he actually fakes preg- nancy to win over a master, even though the dog's name is Charlie. A: Right. Porky finds out the dog is male, throws him out, then Charlie pops right in again to testify: "Well, there was such a case in Venezuela." I loved that line. Then there's the one that takes place in Italy, where Charlie tries to break into a pizza parlor, trumping up an Italian dialect. Yes, I always liked that dog, that eager dog. He's kind of a chauvinist dog, or a salesman dog - always trying to bell himself, advertise himself. But that's really what dogs are. They'll butter you up, lick your foot, die on your grave. PEPE LE PEW Q: What would you say the basic disci- pline is in the Pepe Le Pew series? A: That was miscegenation, obviously. After all, what's a mule but a hunk of mis- cegenation? This is involuntary miscege- nation, which is a slightly different thing. Pepe thought the girl was a female skunk while in reality she was a female cat, and she could never understand why she was being followed, you see. I mean, from her viewpoint, it was miscegenation, while from his viewpoint, it certainly wasn't. The other thing is that Pepe always rep- resented the other side of my personality, because he represented what I wanted to be, and what I think every man would like to be: irresistible, at least in one's own eyes. You don't have to be irresist ble in women's eyes if you think you are. As for Pepe, he got plenty, you might say. But it never occurred to him that he had of- fended anyone. He was never fazed, under any circumstances. In the first cartoon [for scent-imental reasons, 1949], there was a pantomime sequence where the girl is hiding inside a glass case and Pepe is outside, and she is saying [imitates female cat's pantomime of disgust, holding hand to nose] and he goes [imitates Pepe's soundless, shocked/upset reaction]. So he pulls out a gun and walks off, the cat quickly running out, feeling bad about this presumable suicide. It turns out that Pepe is completely all right, of course, wasn't the slightest bit deterred. He just takes the girl in his arms again, saying "Fortunately for you, I meesed." It's that complete self-assurance. With the Coyote of the "Roadrunner" series, I understood him because he made so many mechanical mistakes, which is natural for anybody, particularly for me. But Pepe was the super character, a super sex-job, and he knew it. And he never gave up. Q: Where do you suppose the audience identification goes in those cartoons? To- ward Pepe or toward the female cat? A: I've never been able to discover that, because all the girls I've ever known adore the Pepe character as a sex- object, you might say - he was really irresistible. One of my favorites was wild over you [1953], because there Pepe's mistaken de- sire was this enormous wildcat, and the situation furnished some good remarks - "Acres and acres of her, and she's mine, all mine." I liked the end-line. The wildcat is ferociously fighting Pepe off in a balloon floating away into the dis- tance, and she's clawing the hell out of him. You can't quite tell what was going on, just a big mess, a big brawl in the dis- tance, and then we cut back to a close-up of Pepe, looking up at the viewer and saying, "Eef you haS not tried eet, do not knock eet." Q: At times, Pepe Le Pew is pretty overt, as far as sex goes. A: Well, he's overt, but that's an honest love for a woman . . .1 can't see anything wrong with that. Q: Something one can respect, some- thing one can understand. A: That's what I thought, anyway. The entire cat- mouse cartoon cycle, the chase cycle, might be called "oral" today. But in those days, it was a matter of eating some- body, like a cat eating a mouse. Nourish- ment. Sustenance. Survival. Today, if you say that a character is going to eat somebody - well, it has a different mean- ing. But the skunk Pepe was unique in chase cartoons of the period in the sense that he was after the cat, well, to screw her, I suppose. He says, "She theenks by play- ing hard-to-get she can make herself more attractive to me - how right she eez !" And "Not every man would put up with thees - lucky for her, I am not any man." Q: Are all his feminine foils cats instead of other skunks? A: They had to be. Another skunk wouldn't make any sense, because the other skunk would go for him, so where's the comedy? So there always had to be a ploy of getting a white stripe accidentally down a cat's back, which, I can tell you, got a little tiresome trying to figure out. It was strange since the audience never objected to the implausibility of having it happen again and again, film after film. Q: It's very graceful in cats -bah [1955], where the guy is painting the hull of a ship, and a lady passenger comes down the gangplank with her pet cat on a leash, and some of the paint sloshes on the cat. It's also the film where the seduction story is structured with an "As Time Goes By" Casablanca -like flashback. But why, if Pepe is irresistible to other skunks, would a cat resist him? A: Because he smells bad! When I was a kid, I worked on a boat that carried creosol piling, and I don't know if you've ever been close to creosol piling, but it has a ter- ribly strong smell. But strangely enough, in about four or five days, you forget, and everything resumes its normal smells again, except that everywhere you go, you notice the people reeling - you smell. As f H55h</page><page sequence="16">CHUCK JONES CONTINUED far as Pepe was concerned, it really came down to that simple level of misunder- standing. Do you know what he once said? In one film he daintily sniffs his wrist and says, "Do I offend?" Q: Pepe's one moment of self- awareness. THE SINGING FROG Q: In one froggy evening, much of the humor seems to be derived from a sharp break between anthropomorphized movement and natural animal movement. A: It was anthropomorphic when the frog was singing and dancing and com- pletely natural otherwise. Q: Did you actually use a frog as a model for that? A: I studied a frog, but I didn't actually get a real frog as I did with the squirrel in much ado about nutting. I was more in- terested in the action; I knew I could draw it. It was obvious the way the frog had to move, from the way he was drawn. The trick was that the audience would never hear anything but the frog's singing voice. The rest is entirely pantomime. There are a lot of ways of doing this, and they all seem obvious once you look at them - putting the characters behind the plate glass window in the theatrical agency, for instance. There the timing had to work interestingly, because when the protagonist went back to get the theatrical agent, once the frog had started singing the rag, we kept the music going but you couldn't hear the voice. The phrasing works out so that the frog starts to sing, his owner runs back inside in a hurried fash- ion, trying to tell the agent what's happen- ing. Subconsciously, the audience knows what he's telling him even though there are no words spoken, because the music is still being carried over. The you cut back to the frog; as the frog is finishing the song (" . . .that lov-ing rag!"), PLOP!!, the door opens, a guy points, the frog looks up, croaks, and the theatrical agent gives that tiny look at the audience which I often use - it's one of my favorite gags. Then you cut to the street and the frog and his owner are thrown out. By the way, did you know that Mike Maltese and I wrote "The Michigan Rag"? We needed a ragtime piece, so we wrote one. Q: The whole cartoon seems to be in a parable structure. It's like an excessive punishment for one man's greed - for his desire to exploit the discovery of the sing- ing frog and make millions. A: That's right, the guy wants to join the establishment, enjoy the fruits of the estab- lishment. And that was also one of the first of my continuing or cyclical cartoons, like Horton hears a who, the endings of which imply that what's happened will happen again and again in the future. Q: That certainly existed in cartoons like i was a teenage thumb [1963], which ends with the narrator saying " . . .and he had a son the size of his thumb, and he had a son the size of his thumb, etc." A: Getting back to one froggy evening, it would have been easly to keep on using the Lubitsch trick, implying the action going on behind closed doors or barri- cades. I wanted to see if I could find other ways of conveying the same thought - as when the frog is singing in the part, and the cop is behind the wall. The cop can hear the frog. In this case, it's simply that the cop's eyes are behind the wall; by see- ing the top of his head you know that he's a cop. The cop's activities are determined by the actions of his hat. And then there's the terrible time that the owner of the frog has in the theater: first getting the people in there, then having the rope to the cur- tain break. You have to feel sorry for the guy; he's stuck with that frog and some- how the only place he can get rid of it is back where he got it - back in the corner- stone of another building. It was really an exemplification of frustration, and it continued . . . BUGS BUNNY AND DAFFY DUCK Q: Getting back to the idea of individual disciplines for characters, what about Bugs Bunny? A: Well, I always underwrote the idea of Bugs never being a heckler - he's minding his own business, and then somebody comes along and tries to disturb him, hurt him, destroy him. But when he fights back, he becomes an anarchist, rather like Groucho Marx. Q: It takes a butt from a bull to an- tagonize him in bully for bugs, as Bugs goes sailing over the arena declaring, "Of course, you know, this means war!" A: That's the old Groucho Marx line, and it certainly became basic to Bugs' character. A cross between Harpo and Groucho is what he'd become at that point: he had the intellect of Groucho combined with the zaniness and oddity of Harpo, which I never understood - I'm sure Harpo himself never understood it. In other words, Bugs' behavior would often surprise himself. He never knew what he was going to do next. Another important rule was that we always started him out in an environment natural for a rabbit. Q: With or without banjo, a la LONG-HAIRED HARE? A: Well, that was a slight exception - but he did have his feet in his rabbit- hole and he was out in the woods, remember? Sit- ting there playing the banjo the way any rabbit would under the same circum- stances. And that, to me, was always very important. Next came the provocation, and the provocation is always based upon a guy who is minding his own business. Q: In long-haired hare's musical lan- guage, Bugs Bunny, on the one side, seems to represent the popular, singing pop songs or folk songs, while the opera- singer, on the other side, represents the classical, or in this case, the preten- tious. Where did you find the voice for the opera basso? A: We found a young singer with a terri- bly strong voice. And remember Bugs' re- venge on the opera -singer? The singer's performing at the Hollywood Bowl and Bugs is perched on top of it. Bugs tests the Bowl first, saying "Hmmm . . . acoustically poi- feet!" Then he causes the whole thing to vibrate, bouncing the singer down below. We had to do something similar to our actual singer. We told him, "We're not going to hurt you, but something may happen to you while you're singing. Whatever happens, keep singing." So while he was recording at the microphone, we snuck up behind him, grabbed him and shook him. His voice did just what you hear on the soundtrack. Q: I thing super rabbit holds up very well among your earliest Bugs cartoons. A: In fact, it was one of the first cartoons where I got a real feeling for Bugs, which I had some trouble doing for a little while. That was one of the first times I got a hold on the character, and on the way he would later develop, for me at least. You could see From left: Bugs in SUPER RABBIT (1943); with the opera singer in LONG HAIRED HARE (1948); Porky as Claude Rains in THE SCARLET PUMPERNICKEL (1950). 36 JAN. -FEB. 1975</page><page sequence="17">he was really enjoying himself, which I en- joyed. Q: Well, he certainly seems to enjoy himself during that great scene where the villains try to blast him with the cannon. And this, too, is a Marx Brothers bit, in the way that Bugs imposes a completely foreign discipline on the ominous situa- tion: staging a basketball game with the cannonball, turning the hunters into a rooting section. A: The only reservation that I might have about super rabbit was that it had an ending that only related to that particular time, and that particular war effort in 1942, when Bugs goes off to join the Marines. Q: What sort of disciplines would there be in Daffy Duck cartoons? A: Well, Bugs and Daffy actually started out very similarly . . . they both began as raving lunatics. Daffy eventually became a self-preservationalist. It was really his job to save his own life. Q: But he's always showing off so much. A: Well, he's a show-off too, but basi- cally he was concerned with taking care of himself. Friz Freleng and I used a competi- tion between Bugs and Daffy throughout the "Bugs Bunny Show" TV series. All through it, Daffy was trying to get to be master- of- ceremonies, but Bugs got all the applause. This sort of thing would drive Daffy nuts. Daffy always wanted to be triumphant, in whatever he did, but in some cases, all that meant was having to survive, and he was always apologizing. He'd stand there and say: "Pain hurts me," "I may be a cowardly little black duck, but I'm a live little black duck," or "What a shitty thing to do." We often wrote Daffy's dialogue with four- letter words, and then we'd abridge it later. Q: It seems that Daffy is often cast in ambitious parts that he's always unequal to, Errol Flynn-type romantic leads. A: I don't know why robin hood daffy worked so well. But there you have a straight parody. There he did not act, as usual, the part of a self- preservationist, but he did want people to believe he was Sherlock Holmes, or Robin Hood, or whoever, so he was still trying to establish the fact that he had a right to be there. Q: Would you say that role- playing, then, was central to Daffy's character? A: That's certainly one important aspect, but then there are many pictures where he plays just the part of Daffy Duck. The very early ones don't really count, since he had yet to completely develop his character. Just as you think of Jack Benny as being a very miserly person, so Daffy is miserly re- garding his own life. Of course he can't stand loss of dignity, that's another aspect. Q: There's a brilliant sequence in robin hood daffy, very sad in a way. Daffy has a heroic line to deliver before he performs some athletic feat of derring-do, scream- ing "Yoicks, and away!", swinging on a vine, and smashing right into a large tree. He keeps saying "Yoicks, and away!" over and over, crashing into a new tree each time, his voice getting more and more tired. Wasn't this the cartoon where Daffy's beak kept springing up? A: Yes, it was. Manny Färber called it "a token of Daffy's ineptitude," or some- thing. Q: Genre-parodies often come up in Daffy Duck cartoons. A: Very often. I liked to do that. I did one on Jack Webb, sort of a Dragnet-in- Outer-Space cartoon, called rocket squad. I would say the basic discipline there was to be as true to the original style as possible, accenting the comic qualities of the particular genre all the while. As in rocket squad: "Thursday - 4:05 - P.M. - I struck a match - Thursday - 4:05 and a quarter - P.M. - I lit a cigarette." Q: In THE SCARLET PUMPERNICKEL [1950], you exaggerate, to just the right degree, the Michael Curtiz-type grandiose set de- coration and use of shadow, all those very romantic trappings of costume epics. A: There were a lot of in-house jokes in that cartoon - mostly in the casting. We put on the Mother Bear from those earlier "Three Bears" cartoons I did [bear for PUNISHMENT, BEE-DEVILLED BRUIN, etc.] and Henery Hawk appeared briefly as a messenger - it was an epic, so all my characters had to be in it. Everybody ap- preciated it except Jack Warner, and I don't think he ever realized we were talking about him in the cartoon. Q: Daffy was trying to sell a script to Warner, the script providing the mock- epic story, the cartoon-within-a- cartoon. A: Daffy was no great writer, of course, so the thing had to end with one clichéd disaster after another: "Then, the dam broke!" "Then, the volcano erupted!" "Then, the price of food skyrocketed!" - while pictured on the screen was one kreplach with a pricetag of $1000. The ultimate catastrophe. We end it with Daffy shooting himself, saying "It's getting so you have to kill yourself to sell a story around here!" Q: And drip-along daffy [1951] parodied the high-angle shots generally used for classic high noon gundowns. A: The thing that made that work was the distant sound the horse made. I used the distant spur- jangling sound too, even though the characters weren't wearing any spurs. Q: It seems to me there's a great deal of from a to zzzz's Walter Mitty-ish Ralph Phillips character in Daffy, in his naive de- sire to actually live out these heroic fan- tasies. A: That's right, Daffy's an innocent, he's an ingenuous character. Not only when he is playing parts, but in a straight situation: all he wants to do is survive, and be trium- phant, without having to do the work that was necessary, and without having to be particularly nice. Q: In drip-along daffy, Daffy first rides into the Western town, sees the sign that a sheriff is wanted, opens his coat, and has an all-purpose selection of badges: "Chicken Inspector," "Junior G-Man," etc. He's ready to impersonate any given role at any given moment. A: I like the way he pulls out his guns, and his chaps come off along with them. "Time out, whilst I adjust my accoutrements ..." Q: Daffy seems to be very consistent with those self-conscious asides for his, sent straight to the viewer off the screen. You've said that you didn't preview your cartoons, but one verbal bit in rabbit fire [1951] must have been previewed. Elmer Fudd is stalking both Bugs and Daffy - this is the first fully developed car- toon that features all three of them together - and Bugs keeps engineering it so that Daffy is the one who gets blasted by Elmer. Daffy angrily takes Bugs by the col- lar and says, "You're despicable!" This line always brings down the house . . .and then, as if you knew it would get a terrific laugh, Daffy proceeds to soliloquize on Bugs' despicability, elaborating on the line. A: No, I actually rewrote the line on the soundstage when Mel Blanc said "You're THE SCARLET PUMPERNICKEL. Left: Daffy and Melissa Duck. Right: Curtizian swordplay as Melissa watches. FILM COMMENT 37</page><page sequence="18">CHUCK JONES CONTINUED despicable!" The way he said the line was so good and so strong that I immediately rewrote the line, and said "Look, I want you to play with this thing, draw it our as much as you can - You're despicable, and not only that, you're pickable, and not only that . . . ." And Mel just kept going. Q: It does appear very spontaneous. A: It was spontaneous ... I just let Mel go, him run out of gas on the idea. We used that in one of the Westerns, too . . . Q: Yeah, Daffy's great mouthings-on. There's a lot of rambling speech in the "Charlie Dog" cartoons as well. A: They were both pretty noisy charac- ters. Those "Charlie" cartoons were real talk- fes ts. I probably prepared myself for not talking, in the pantomime cartoons, by talking a lot in these. And I enjoyed it. Q: From your very first cartoons, you made a great effort to find those plots and situations that are so basic that there's no need for dialogue - so often, you've opted for pantomime cartoons. Is it simply a mat- ter of your preference for visual rather than verbal wit? There must be more to it, since when you use dialogue, you use it in a spe- cial or unique way. A: I could understand a person's inabil- ity to express himself more than I could his ability to express himself. Like Daffy say- ing, "You're despicable! And not only that you're pickable, etc."; he was always reaching for it. Frustrating verbal expres- sion seems to me to be more effective be- cause, well, that's what I know best. Q: Friz Freleng's characters, on the other hand, were always more vocal. A: Yeah, there's a classic example, when he has Yosemite Sam telling Bugs to shut up... Q: And Bugs answers back, "Sure I'll shut up, of course I'll shut up, I'll shut up any time anybody says so. I'm the kind of person who shuts up whenever I'm told to, I'm the best shutter- upper you ever saw, I'm . . ." A: And then Sam screams, "Shut up shutting up!!" Anyway, it is a different way to approach the character, and I guess I never used dialogue to that extent. Q: I'd say that you had a more self- contained Bugs . . . A: Maybe. I'd suspect that Friz's Bugs would be more of a scamp, and Tex Avery's more a controlled lunatic, a bril- liant controlled lunatic. Bob Clampett's was a thoroughly amoral lunatic, with flashes of greatness. All these characters - Bugs, Daffy, Pepe, Porky - in a way are like the multiplications of our own foibles. And if they weren't, of course, they wouldn't be valuable at all, they wouldn't be funny. But I suspect that all humor is based on that fact: the recogni- tion in others, in a multiplied form, of something that we ourselves are capable of. It's like what Orwell said: "I've never met a person that was any worse than I am."*/?
