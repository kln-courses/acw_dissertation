RUMBAUGH Departments of Psychology and Biology, Georgia State University, University Plaza Atlanta, Georgia 30303-3083 USA A review of THE NEW ANTHROPOMORPHISM. ByJohn S. Kennedy. Cambridge University Press, Cam- bridge and New York. $54.95 (hardcover); $17.95 (paper). ix + 194 p.; ill.; subject index. ISBN: 0-521-41064-9 (hc); 0-521-42267-1 (pb). 1992. In The New Anthropomorphism, Kennedy rails against "creeping anthropomorphism" (p. 165), in the form of animal cognitivism (p. 157), that he reads in the works of neobehaviorists, who differ ". . . from their radical forebears in not discounting internal processes in the causation of behaviour" (p. 6). He is distressed that neobehaviorists, be they etholo- gists or comparative/animal psychologists, are "ad- dictively anthropocentric" (p. 6) as revealed by their efforts to relate animal behavior to human psychol- ogy. This anthropocentrism is said to foster, in turn, anthropomorphism, possibly sanctioned because "radical behaviourism has been discredited" (p. 6). Kennedy also rails against the consequences of re- ductionism, particularly when it discounts holism and argues ". . . that higher-level events are expli- cable and predictable entirely in terms of lower- level events" (p. 7). Kennedy accepts Asquith's 1984 definition of an- thropomorphism as "the ascription of human men- tal experiences to animals" (p. 9). He then argues that humans are aware of three kinds of mental experience - feelings, motivations and thought - on the basis that "we are directly aware of these [experiences] . . . through introspection" (p. 9, emphasis added). Kennedy differentially tolerates "mock" and "ex- plicit" anthropomorphism. Because mock anthro- pomorphism might help a researcher gain new per- spectives of behavior by identifying with animals, it can be tolerated so long as it is clearly declared a metaphorical view and not asserted as a proximate cause for the behavior. On the other hand, explicit anthropomorphism is universally intolerable -even Professor J. S. Kennedy died on 4 February 1993 at age 80. A graduate of University College, London, he joined V. B. Wigglesworth's ARC Unit of Insect Physiology at Cambridge in 1943. Kennedy was a Fellow of the Royal Society and the recipient of many honors, and after his retirement he worked in the Zool- ogy Department at Oxford until his death. if it finds its way into Kennedy's own work, as he discusses briefly (p. 8). Explicit anthropomorphism must be rejected because ". . . it assumes animals are conscious" (p. 95), and, for Kennedy, the ques- tion of animal consciousness is untestable, hence unscientific (p. 32). The nexus of Kennedy's argument is, perhaps, best articulated (p. 9) as he asserts that, according to introspective reports, humans can form a mental image of a goal/outcome of a conscious action that precedes action. Kennedy assumes that the mental image ". . . is a prime cause" (p. 10) of human behavior, and that, accordingly, human actions may be described as 'purposeful, intentional or goal- directed" (p. 10). But he rejects imagery as a basis for animals' behaviors because ". . . there is no direct evidence either way . . ." regarding it (p. 10, emphasis added). Thus, for human behavior, Ken- nedy ascribes a proximate causal role to imagery because he argues that it can be accessed directly by introspection. By contrast, because animals ap- pear not to introspect, imagery is assigned no such role. Thus, Kennedy denies that there is any evi- dence for animals' imagery, representation, thought, feelings, motivations, intentions, and so on, and implores the reader not to apply these terms to animals because they are anthropomorphic. To me, Kennedy's conclusions and arguments are not compelling. To argue that imagery, and its possible causal role in behavior, can be inferred only through introspective report is unwarranted. Regarding "introspective report," it is important to note that it is basically verbal behavior; hence, it should be viewed as only indirect evidence of private events. Further, there is no "direct evi- dence" or other basis that permits us to be confident that individuals' introspections are comprehensive, faithful analogs of mental experience and imagery. And even if one allows the content of introspection, whether it plays a genuine causal role in behavior is without solid evidence. To argue that we cannot learn of imagery and its role in animal behavior because animals are incapable of introspection discounts researchers' abilities to develop other methods for possibly ac- cessing imagery, at least in part, in animals. The abilities of great apes to perform accurately on trial- one tests of novel cross-modal perceptions (e.g., from touch to vision and vice versa), and the abili- ties of language-competent apes to select objects, by palpation, in response to seeing symbols that</page><page sequence="2">JUNE 1994 NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 249 represent them, rebuts that position. Also, lan- guage-trained chimpanzees (Sherman and Austin, Savage-Rumbaugh, 1986) were able to categorize 17 words according to whether they represented a "food" or "tool" item without being told the cate- gory to which each word belonged. If these words had not represented various foods (e.g., raisins or sweet potatoes) or tools (e. g., lever, wrench, or stick) to the chimps, they could not have determined the conceptual category to which a word belonged. (I would not call representation a mental experience that is dependent upon or accessed through intro- spection, but rather a natural, lawful cognitive op- eration, basic to complex-task solving skills, that possibly entails imagery.) Thus Kennedy allows mentalistic bases for hu- man but not animal behavior. For the sake of re- buttal and granting that Kennedy might be cor- rect, from whence did human mental experience, consciousness, and their causal roles in behavior arise? Have they no evolutionary roots or homo- logs in extant animals? Despite robust biological and neurological continuities between animal and human, is there absence of continuity in their com- plex psychology? How can (could?) there be such profound biological continuity and no psychologi- cal continuity of consciousness, feelings, motiva- tions, cognition, and so on? Are we to assume that evolution drew a sharp demarcation when it pro- vided for conscious awareness in humans but in no animals? To summarily reduce all efforts to relate animal behavior to human behavior as anthropomorphic and mentalistic is unwarranted. To argue the null hypothesis (e.g., that animals have no feelings, imagery, or self-awareness) is to discourage new tactics of research that both have shed and will continue to shed light on important psychological continuities between animal and human behav- iors. And such psychological continuities are not necessarily reflections of anthropomorphism, any more so that comparisons of, say, orangutan (Pongo) and gorilla (Gorilla) nest-building and infant-care patterns with those of chimpanzee (Pan) make the study "Pan-centric" and flawed by Panmorphism. To attempt to compare and contrast behaviors and psychologies of closely related forms of life is a perfectly reasonable goal of science, even when the study includes Homo. That such comparisons might be more difficult and carry greater risk calls for the development of new methods of inquiry, not abandonment of a legitimate effort. Behavioral science does not need a rehashing of the sins of anthropomorphism (and, indeed, those sins can be awful!) nearly so much as it needs new para- digms and systems for description that are sensitive to the dimensions of Darwinian continuity that em- brace humans and animals (that possibly include consciousness, awareness, intentionality, and lan- guage). To me, any harm that even the rankest anthro- pomorphist might inflict on the fields of animal behavior and comparative psychology is equalled by the supremacist's view that humans are to be distinguished from animals because of their special brain (p. 18) and their private states of being that can be directly accessed through introspection. True enough, our species might, at least in the short term, be speciously judged more successful if repro- ductive success, the accessing of natural resources, and the generation of cultures and language sys- tems are criteria. On the other hand, our selfish, seemingly relentless exploitation of this planet, as efforts are made to exploit commercially the con- sumptive appetites of our exploding populations, is very costly to all forms of life, including our own, and will not likely permit our species to be heralded long term for its "biological success" (p. 18). Our species threatens to fail as a natural form of life, which it is, in its commerce with the natural order of life and the world to which it inextricably be- longs. From this perspective, our special brain has not served even our own interests well. Kennedy states, "It cannot, then, be assumed that the continuity of the evolutionary process means that we [humans] differ from other animals in de- gree only, or that other animals must be conscious to a significant degree" (p. 18). It is agreed that such continuity of consciousness cannot be assumed, but, as argued below, it seems highly probable that such continuity does exist. Perhaps Kennedy was unaware of recent ad- vances in ape-language research that documents a bonobo's (Pan paniscus) ability to comprehend the syntax of novel sentences of request at the level of a 2 /2 -year-old child (Savage-Rumbaugh et al., 1993, for a recent, comprehensive report of earlier ones dating from 1987). Rather, based on a dated litera- ture review, he discounts the field of ape-language research as a misguided, anthropomorphic ven- ture. A more current knowledge of primate cogni- tion might have led him to consider the rhesus monkey's ability to calculate the trajectories of mov- ing targets so as to shoot them with high accuracy in video-formatted task situations, an ability thought earlier to be uniquely human (Washburn and Rum- baugh, 1992). He might have discussed the impli- cations of the report by Washburn and Rumbaugh (1991) that rhesus monkeys readily learn the ordi- nal ranks of the Arabic numerals 0 through 9 in a fashion best summarized as a "matrix of relative values" which, in turn, allows them to choose the larger of two numerals on several novel pairings of those numerals. This extraordinary or supra- learning occurred without penalty of choice, in that</page><page sequence="3">250 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY VOLUME 69 regardless of which numeral was selected, the rhe- sus got a corresponding quantity of pellets of food. Kennedy missed several other good opportuni- ties in his book. He might have explained why large numbers of researchers find explicit behav- iorism (to parallel his use of "explicit anthropomor- phism") inadequate to the task of building fields of comparative psychology and behavior. He might have discussed what nonverbal techniques would have to reveal for him to argue in support of ar- guments for animal consciousness, imagery, self- awareness, and so on, rather than to declare them unsuccessful and probably unachievable. He might have acknowledged the heuristic value of positions taken by scientists in revolt, notably Griffin, and the new lines of research being avidly and produc- tively pursued as a consequence. Several of Kennedy's assertions, such as "Inten- tionality is indeed scientifically untestable in ani- mals, but among people [their] warnings [to oth- ers] are, by definition, intentional" (p. 85); that, with reference to animals, ". . . we cannot hope to tell from their behaviour whether they suffer or not" (p. 118); and that "we human primates can defy the dictates of our genes" (p. 167) are at best unfortunate and discourage new thought and new methods of inquiry required for behavioral science to progress. I agree that anthropomorphism has great pitfalls and should not be confused with science. Yet, on the other hand, for Kennedy to oppose research programs as "anthropocentric," because they strive to relate animal behavior to human behavior, is ill advised. When he does so he discounts the fact that several of them are productive programs of research that span decades and have had tough peer review for funding and publication all along the way. By those criteria, they are solid scien- tific programs. Interestingly, Kennedy does admit that anthro- pomorphism, in its "mock" form, can have heu- ristic value in guiding the experimenter to new and fruitful perspectives and that, in several situa- tions, anthropomorphism enables better predic- tion than other perspectives allow (p. 88)? How can this be? Clearly, something important might be being missed. We need a keen analysis of an- thropomorphism and a specific definition of how it has been and might be used productively, rather than destructively. Might a new, objective, rigor- ous, exciting, and comprehensive perspective of behavior be enabled through selective exploitation of possible advantages offered by anthropomor- phism, while also avoiding its dangers? I agree with Kennedy that there are real prob- lems in the use of our language systems for building a science of behavior. Kennedy acknowledges that radical behaviorism has been "discredited" and ap- peals for the development of neobehavioral per- spectives. But, to me, if the history of behaviorism has taught anything, it is that for perspectives of behavior to thrive and to be generally accepted they, in all likelihood, will have to take into ac- count, rather than to discount, the larger questions that bear upon the evolution of a sense of "being" (such as being alive) and some sense of "knowing." By this I mean that the evolution of animal life in its great diversity surely has provided some animal forms, and not just humans, with sensations/infor- mation whereby they perceive that they and others are beings and that, because of their genes and experiences, they perceive that they "know" certain things about their competencies relative to their niches. No inanimate matter, element, or phenome- non basic to physics or chemistry is even suspect of having such senses. In their advanced forms, the senses of being and knowing might well be basic to the emergence of the more complex and creative behavioral adaptations for which our spe- cies can be noted. These senses should not be pre- sumed to be absent in animals, particularly those closely related to us. To search for them should compel good science, not anthropomorphism. Animal behavior and comparative psychology are achieving standing as solid sciences. Such prog- ress is being made, however, by thinkers who dare to think beyond the bounds of traditional methods and traditional behaviorism. So they must; and so they should. Better that they run the gauntlet of scientific criticism and eventually fail, if they do, than to be ruled "out of order" by labels, by traditional perspectives, or by outmoded standards. There is reason for optimism that their bold ven- tures will be successful. With every passing year there is new and increasingly solid evidence that some animals have capabilities for functions held previously to be uniquely human. In my opinion, the evidence for point-for-point dimensions of behavior/ psychology held in common between at least some animal forms and humans include planning, sym- bolism, representation, intentionality, and speech comprehension that can include the decoding of syntax - and the list could be expanded. I agree that these capabilities are reflections of emergent qualitatively unique properties provided by quan- titative enhancements afforded by evolution. Yet these properties are by no means unique to Homo. On the above points I clearly disagree with Ken- nedy. In my perspective, the field of animal behav- ior both needs and requires a comparative perspec- tive, one that relates neural structure and function to the different profiles of adaption of even closely related forms of life -human included. On the other hand, I would go even farther than Kennedy regarding his closing statement, which reads, "If the age-old mind-body problem comes</page><page sequence="4">JUNE 1994 NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 251 to be considered as an exclusively human one, in- stead of indefinitely extended through the animal kingdom, then that problem too will have been brought nearer to a solution" (p. 168). I do not think the use of and/or arguments that focus upon issues of "mind" have been, now are, or are likely to be very fruitful. I would argue that the word "mind" should never, never be used nor read as a scientific term. It is neither a "thing," nor a scien- tific construct, nor an intervening variable. At best the word mind should be used as a summary term that references something "very complex" in the behavior/psychology of a given organism. Mind is not an entity, the existence of which is to be proved or disproved. Mind is more of a "puff-ball" than it is a word than can be used productively to explain behavior -human or animal. Rather than waste our energies arguing about the presence or absence of "mind" in a literal way, let us get on with the necessary and thoroughly legitimate tasks of determining the antecedents of behavior and the processes that mediate them-"mind" not be- ing one of them. Admittedly, some of the behavior to be understood is very, very complex -and not likely to be understood as reflexive. But "mind" will never explain it either. Only a detailed, empirical definition of the parameters of complex behavior and the subsequent juxtaposition of apparently simi- lar behaviors of other species is likely to explain be- havior. To do so, however, we need to work and to pull together -and not apart! To the degree scientists appear to be working at odds and contrary to the cause of behavioral science, they need to talk to- gether more, work together more - and not rail so much, even as I might be guilty of doing so in this review of Kennedy's volume! Used in conjunction with other materials, this book can be useful in advanced upper-division and graduate courses in animal behavior. REFERENCES Savage-Rumbaugh, E. S. (1986).
