What a person hopes to see in the mirror reflects what his or her society values most, in our case, youth. The ancient Maya also went to extreme lengths to trans- form their bodies. They invested vast amounts of wealth - and endured unspeakable pain - to make themselves beautiful. Through their artwork and the study of their physical remains we can begin to understand what motivated their search for physical perfection. What did ancient Maya men and women hope to see when they looked in their pyrite mirrors? 36 ARCHAEOLOGY • January/February 2009</page><page sequence="2">An ancient Maya ruler checks his reflection in a pyrite mirror while an attendant applies red paint to his backside. On the far left, a woman wearing a star-patterned dress holds what could be the ruler's death mask. Perhaps the men wanted to look like K'inich Janaab' Pakal (Pakal the Great), who ruled the city of Palenque in northern Chiapas, Mexico, from a.d. 612 until his death in 683» Few ancient Maya remains have been as thoroughly studied as Pakal s» His tomb within Palenques Temple of the Inscriptions provides a clear view of the standard of beauty to which ancient Maya men aspired» A stucco head wedged under his sarcophagus and a mosaic jade mask on his face convey idealized notions of his appearance» But what did he look like in real life? From my first visit to Palenque in 1975, and throughout my nearly 30-year career as a Mesoamerican art historian, Ive been asking questions about this man who made Palenque a force to be reckoned with and then built his own great funerary pyramid, a ruler whose descendants worshiped him as a deity Pakal s bones and teeth were recently restudied by Vera Tiesler and Andrea Cucina of the Autonomous University of Yucatán, and they can now tell us more about his physical appearance. First, Pakal was taller than most ancient Maya men, standing just over five feet four inches. And unlike most people of his day, his bones display no signs of disease or malnutrition. Pakal received the typical cranial modification for someone born into an elite family Shortly after birth, while his skull was still soft and growing, his mother applied a binding device to his forehead so that his cranium grew into a long, tapered form, smartly indented above the brow line. As a king, Pakal was expected to personify several impor- tant deities. In stone carvings, his clothing and adornments reflect associations with the gods of rain and lightning, but his body was shaped to resemble the Sun and Maize gods. Pakal s mother may have hung a bead between his eyes when he was a baby so that he would become permanently cross- eyed, a trait associated with the Sun God. The Maya believed that because they had to squint to look at the sun, the Sun God also squinted back at them.

The mirror has lost its shine, but would have been a must-have accessory for the fashionable Maya nobleman or woman on the go. eyes would have given Pakal the appearance of squinting* Also like the Sun God, he had filed teeth in the shape of the letter "T," which accentuated his squinting expression by drawing attention to the center of his face* At the time of his death, Pakal had lost two molars and periodontal disease may have given him some pain, but the 24 teeth in his mouth had not a single cavity The earliest image of Pakal, a profile carving on an oval tablet found in his royal palace, emphasizes his flattened forehead» His simply rendered body reveals a slim physique* Pakal also had luxuriant hair, which he wore in thick, layered tresses trimmed to blunt ends in the front and tied in the back* His hair flopped forward like corn silk surrounded by leaves at the top of a healthy maize plant* Because each kernel on a cob requires a strand of silk to be pollinated, abundant corn silk pointed to a healthy cob of maize - and Pakals hair indicated his maize-like perfection* Images of him suggest he wore a nosepiece to extend the long, tapering line of his nose into his forehead* How the nosepiece was worn is not known, but it seems to have been a fashion among the Maya* Images of defeated captives depict them with prominent foreheads and round or snub noses, while the victorious lords are shown with the bridge of their noses meeting their foreheads in an unbroken line that sometimes extended all the way to their hair* According beings of the out K'iche of to masa Maya, the , the Popol creator same Vuh, maize gods the dough formed creation the human Maya story According of the K'iche Maya, creator gods formed human beings out of masa , the same maize dough the Maya still use to make tortillas and tamales* The typical maize plant yields one healthy ear; others ripen only as nubbins 38</page><page sequence="4">The ancient Maya pressed and bound their skulls into a variety of shapes that probably reflected an individual's place in society. or succumb to the maize fungus, Ustilago mayáis » Like the plant, the Maize God surrounded himself with dwarves and hunchbacks, symbolizing imperfect ears of maize - embodiments of the ugly and deformed» Maya rulers also associated with dwarves and hunchbacks* The Maize God lived for only a single season - growing and ripening, then harvested and planted once again as a tiny kernel in an eternal cycle of death and rebirth. Although Pakal surely grew wrinkled in old age, depictions of him and most Maya elites always retain a youthful appearance» On the surface of Pakal s vast sarcophagus, he is shown with his hair styled like the Maize God and a burning torch protruding from his forehead like Kawiil, a lightning deity worshiped by Palenques royalty» Once they laid the dead king within the sarcophagus, his attendants placed a mask bearing the Maize Gods features made of small jade tesserae, like individual maize kernels, onto his face, giving him the appearance of eternal youth even in death» In this sense he was planted like a maize kernel at the base of the Temple of Inscriptions» Pakal both lived and died as the Maize God» Maya God example, standards applied is shown to women of on beauty the as well lid based of as his men» on sarcophagus the Pakal, Maize for God applied to women as well as men» Pakal, for example, is shown on the lid of his sarcophagus wearing the Maize Gods jade skirt» It is the same skirt his mother is shown wearing on an oval tablet from the royal palace at Palenque» Women's skulls were also bound into elongated shapes, and they filed their teeth or drilled holes Beautiful Skulls Head-shaping practices one distinctive they inherited of and the is one ancient deeply from of their Maya, the rooted most Jm À distinctive and deeply rooted practices of the ancient Maya, À one they inherited from their Jm Olmec forebears» Of the 1,600 skulls that have been studied from 122 Maya sites in present-day Mexico, Guatemala, J Belize, and Honduras, an astounding L 90 percent had artificially shaped era- 1 niums, with males and females equally V represented» Mothers began deform- n ing their children's skulls shortly M after birth by applying devices such 1p as splints, cradleboards, or tightly y wound cloth» ^ The practice of head shaping jJM was a regular part of pre-Hispanic W life and was required for a child's ^ integration into society, which often took the form of hetz mek, or naming celebrations» Artistic representations of deforming apparatuses have been found on whistles and other musical instruments commonly used to accompany these rites and ceremonies» While head-shaping was practiced by people from all levels of society, my research team , found striking temporal and regional differ- A enees in shapes» During the Preclassic period (2000 B»c»-A»D» 250), some Maya had tall, round heads, emulating a head form of the I Olmec gods depicted in ancient artwork» The different splinting and wrapping i techniques created a greater diver- Í group» lar iods Classic differences» ity The a shape specific to of variety head, indicated the There skull period family shape were Slanted shapes suggests were (a»d» membership popular or of also skulls, community during 250-900)» the that regional Maize in simi- each the the in Classic period (a»d» 250-900)» The variety suggests that each shape indicated membership in a specific family or community group» There were also regional differences» Slanted skulls, simi- lar to the shape of the Maize iods head, were popular in the western Maya lowlands» Erect Y shapes seemed to have been in fash- ion across the highlands of Chiapas W and Guatemala» Sometimes the ancient * Maya used constricting bands to divide the head down the middle from the front to the JF back, producing two distinctive lobes» By a»d» 900, tall skulls with flattened foreheads became the standard throughout the Maya world and were still in fashion 600 years later when the first Europeans arrived in Mesoamerica» - Vera Tiesler, professor of anthropology at the Autonomous University of Yucatán www.archaeology.org 39</page><page sequence="5">Above: A painted figurine from Jaina Island shows an aged creator god and the Moon Goddess in a lascivious embrace.
