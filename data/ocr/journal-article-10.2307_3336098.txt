<plain_text><page sequence="1">Qua Terracotta Sculptures V 1. EKPO The Nigerian cultural heritage has in recent years been more widely pub- licized and generally acclaimed than ever before, especially since the world tour of the exhibition "Treasures of Ancient Ni- geria" in 1980. A wide variety of ter- racotta sculpture spanning more than two thousand years has emerged from the area of distribution of the Nok cul- ture (from north of the Kaduna River to south of the Benue at Katsina Ala), from the sites of Ife, Owo, and Benin in the southwestern forest belt, and from Igbo-Ukwu in the Awka area of south- eastern Nigeria. In the extreme south- eastern region, hitherto relatively ne- glected as a source of archaeological mate- rial, terracotta finds from the Qua- populated areas of the lower Cross River have begun to appear. Most of the pieces described here were recovered from foundation trenches dug for new buildings in Calabar and are ac- companied by eyewitness accounts of their discovery. Two of the over ten sites yielded figurines, and in these cases the archaeological rescue work in which I participated provided valuable informa- tion as to provenance and other data (Ekpo 1977, 1978, 1983, in press; Ekpo &amp; Nicklin 1982). 1 Generally the terracotta sculptures were from specially made pits 60-180 centimeters deep. The pits were darker in color than the surrounding soil. Circular in outline near the surface (about 80 centimeters in diameter), their configuration changed to an oval about 120 centimeters by 90 centimeters at a depth of around 100 centimeters. Such pit sites are a common feature in and around the Qua areas of Calabar. They are often found intact, filled with a vari- ety of archaeological material whose fre- quency of occurrence varies: pottery, metal blades, fishing hooks, lumps of red laterite, oval white pebbles, broken rubbing stones, imported porcelain plates, glass square-faced gin bottles, and beads. Charcoal particles are always present at the top and bottom of the pit. Often a single pot or a nest of a few simple vessels is found above the main inventory, a practice that some authors believe was associated with Early Iron Age sites of South African Bantu-speak- ers (Maggs &amp; Davison 1981). The surround- ing soil shows burn traces. [he lack of definite evidence of human remains at the pits and the nature of the finds indicate that these were places for the safekeeping of ritual objects.2 The ob- jects may have been used in traditional ceremonies involving cooking, eating, sacrifice, and libation, being buried after each use. After some time the practice of the site was abandoned, and the place became covered with a layer of topsoil. It may have been that the main inventory in the pit was used only very occasion- ally, while the more shallowly buried pot or nest of pots was sufficient for more frequent rituals. In oral interviews I con- ducted it was repeatedly confirmed that the areas where the pits were discovered were burial and sacrificial grounds where generations of Qua families main- tained family shrines and where special rituals were performed periodically. One such ritual connected with the fertility cult Nnim was last carried out in 1958, according to an informant, and was said to involve the cooking and eating of a huge female goat, libation, and painting of the body with native chalk, kept in special pottery bowls (ise Nnim) at the foot of a large tree. The ceremony was performed by the eldest female member of the family, who was considered to be the guardian of the shrine; her position was inherited from her mother. Manilla currency, round pebbles, special pots, chalk, and other paraphernalia were hidden at the sacrificial place. The terracotta figurines were discov- ered among numerous pottery objects (mostly richly decorated vessels, un- doubtedly ceremonial in nature), round white pebbles, charcoal particles, and in one case, metal blades (Ekpo 1982). Some of the sculptures had been damaged be- fore their placement in the ground, as is the case with the head in Figure 2 and the only female figurine in the group (Fig. 9). The head had fallen inside the large globular pot it originally surmounted, while the female sculpture (as well as its male counterpart) was found lying on its side, shielded by a large open bowl (ise) and a stone slab (Ekpo, in press). With one exception, the sculptures represent human beings. The coil-built body is either globular, like an upturned water vessel, or cylindrical; the head was made separately and attached to the figure. Almost all are of unspecified sex, but possess well-modeled faces and decora- tion on the front of the body. They also generally display an elaborate coiffure. One piece may be zoomorphic, having a projection at its base, reminiscent of an animal appendage (Fig. 1). Two holes have been pierced symmetrically on each ....... 1. ZOOMORPHIC (?)

A row of three holes is situated vertically on the other side of the round body A decora- tive relief band, accented by deep grooves above and below, passes along the broken top of the figure, where a head may once have been attached. The walls are covered with multiple verti- cally incised lines drawn with a comb- or broom-like instrument. Four anthropomorphic sculptures are very similar in size and style, although they originated from two different sites (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5). Except for Figure 2 each is about 19-26 centimeters in height, with a maximum body diameter of 12-14 cen- timeters. The facial features are well de- fined and correctly positioned. The head was formed separately and attached to an upturned water-pot body with the help of a clay band. Eyebrows and ear- lobes are made of separately molded clay strips; at the points of attachment the wall has been deeply scored for better adhesion. The curved features, espe- cially the long sweeping eyebrows that meet above the mouth, contrast with the trim straight-line slits representing the earholes, eyes, and mouth. In Figure 2, short vertical slabs under the mouth in- dicate teeth. The head in Figure 2 is the most elabo- rately executed piece in this group. It is crowned with an exquisite hairdo con- sisting of several separately molded flat clay strips decorated in a crisscross motif. A wide central band of hair starts above the forehead and passes over the crown toward the back of the head, where pieces have broken off. A round rosette shape is situated on each side at the back, and a thin twisted band passes . . . .. .. . . 4. ANTHROPOMORPHIC FIGURINE (HEAD MISSING). 19cm. around the front of the rosette on the right side of the head. In Figure 5 the rosette shapes are blurred into a general expansion of the hair mass on both sides. The geometric configuration of the coif- fures in Figures 2 and 5 is highly reminis- cent of the shaved-head hairdos re- ported by Talbot (1969, appendix) among the Ejagham groups of the upper Cross River region, to whom the Qua are closely related. Small round holes in the crowns of all the heads possibly served for affixing certain bird feathers (signifying high rank in the local traditional societies) and provided air vents during the firing of the piece as well. Bold horizontal bands with comb-teeth impressions on top de- lineate the upper forehead and shoul- ders of the sculptures. On the front of the bodies, deep vertical grooves and ridges appear on either side of a central round boss representing the navel, which is bordered above and below by identical panels of relief designs (Figs. 3-5). On Figures 4 and 5 there are symmetrically counterbalanced curved clay strips with notched surfaces. Figure 3 has an incised X, with horizontally incised lines border- ing two other notched clay strips above and below the navel boss. The sculpture in Figure 6 resembles a globular water pot in size and shape. The facial features differ from the other figural pieces in the triangular central ridge with two impressed hollows under the tip, representing a nose with nostrils, and in the three curved impressions on the temples, probably indicating tribal markings. Most of the notched relief band under the neck has peeled off, leav- ing a black line. The top of the head is missing. There are also some differences in the treatment of the body. A bold V-shaped design incised on the chest probably represents strings of beads. Incised curved motifs at either side depict the arms. The multiple in- cised lines used in these features are typ- ical of Qua pottery design. Another stylistic approach is exhibited by the double-crested sculpture in Fig- ure 7. The slit treatment of eyes and mouth is still employed, but prominent nasal, eyebrow-forehead, cheek, and cheek-to-ear ridges contribute to the grave, almost forbidding appearance of the sculpture. The heavy T shape of the 5. ANTHROPOMORPHIC FIGURINE. 26cm. 6.

Two sets of parallel grooves on the surface of the hairdo form a chevron configuration and visually counteract each other, as do the straight and curved triple lines on the front of the body. The lower part of this figure has broken off, but it is likely to have been the same as the upturned pot bases of the other examples. I found a pair of anthropomorphic fig- ures (Figs. 8, 9), first interpreted as male and female, in 1978 (Ekpo, in press). They display a three-dimensional and much more naturalistic style of Qua ter- racotta sculpture. Their basic form is cylindrical, with head and arms attached separately The bigger, definitely female figure (Fig. 9) is 26.5 centimeters high. It 7. DOUBLE-CRESTED FIGURINE. 19cm. 8. MALE FIGURINE. 21cm. displays pendulous breasts, a circular navel, and a vertical slit indicating the pubic area. The curved arms, made of solid coils, their ends pushed through holes into the body at the shoulders, are akimbo, with fingers incised into the hip area. Carefully formed representations of double-coil manilla bracelets adorn the wrists. The head is missing. The smaller male terracotta (Fig. 8), 21 cen- timeters high, is similarly treated but has round bosses as nipples, and the wrists carry coiled bracelets, apparently repre- senting originals made of plaited fiber. Each hand holds an oval object resem- bling a leaf or fan, more likely the former. As in the female terracotta, a slit appears in the pubic area. Fragments of the head found in situ indicate a somewhat flat face with eyebrow/forehead and nasal ridges, and teeth represented by slits cut through the clay wall. Stylized linear body designs are absent from the pair. The male terracotta was found next to a small round pebble and a clay cone; numerous sieve and funnel shapes and other pottery forms were also included among the 150 objects crammed in the small oval pit. There were also a small vase-like vessel with life-size relief fig- ures of lizards attached to the outside walls, and a large jar fragment with sym- bolic relief representations of the right hand, cowries, and possibly stone axes, as well as various geometric designs (il- lustrated in Ekpo 1983). No metal objects or imported glass or china were found at this site. All these sculptures were undoubt- edly of ritual significance and must have been employed in ceremonies of impor- tant Qua societies, possibly those of the Nnim fertility cult of the Ejagham, from whom the Qua people originate. The well-decorated wide-rimmed bowls (ise, isele, or ise Nnim) are characteristic of all buried assemblages. A small triangular blade, fitting Talbot's description of a cir- cumcision instrument used by the Nnim priestesses among the Ejagham, was found together with the terracotta head in Figure 2. Anthropomorphic terracotta sculptures are reported to have been seen on the graves of Nnim priestesses (Talbot 1969, vol. 2: 131, 133, 1393). The cultural, linguistic, and economic links between the Qua clans in the lower Cross River area and their Ejagham rela- tions in the forest hinterland have been zealously kept alive for the past four cen- turies, reinforced by new migrational waves down to the coast. Some of the ritual sculpture (like many Qua wives) may have been brought from Ejagham areas up the Cross River as well. Although the physical properties of the material from which the sculptures were made appear to be the same as those of the clay material available in the area, no definitive laboratory investiga- tions have been conducted so far. The mode of manufacture and decorative techniques are also similar to those of numerous pottery materials recovered from the various archaeological sites in the area (Ekpo 1978, 1983, in press). Most Qua pottery is coarse, porous, and flaky, heavily tempered to withstand the tradi- tional open-fire method. The terracotta sculptures are no exceptions. Unfortunately, the artistic tradition of making terracotta sculptures and ritual pottery has now died out in the lower Cross River area, although the tradition is still alive in parts of Igboland and around Ogoja. The cults and practices for which they were required faded irre- trievably along the Calabar coast by the middle of the twentieth century. Perhaps more information could be col- lected in the middle and upper Cross River areas, where isolated pockets of Ejagham ritual pottery tradition may still survive, as among the Agoi and Bahumuno of Obubra area.4 The cur- vilinear treatment of the facial and body elements of the figurines is echoed in the carved stone monoliths, many of which still exist in situ in the middle Cross River area. Some early skin-covered masks have the same eye, ear, mouth, and teeth presentation found in these terracotta sculptures. At the beginning of the twen- tieth century, Talbot (1969) recorded the vestiges of a highly artistic pottery- making tradition among the Ejagham. Some of the most complex decorative motifs of the Qua ritual pots have paral- lels in the artistic traditions of the Kuba of the Congo River region (Ekpo 1983), as well as in the background motifs of the bronzes from fifteenth- and sixteenth- century Benin and ninth- and tenth- century Igbo-Ukwu. Perhaps some- where along this path lies information about the origin, development, and in- teraction of Bantu-related groups in the Nigeria-Cameroon-Congo region. D Notes, page 96 9.

The exact location of sites and materials has been delib- erately withheld in this article in order to protect these and other objects from the activities of unscrupulous art hun- ters. 2. In the Cross River region, funerary or commemorative material is usually not located at the site of burial, which is normally under the floor of the house. This is true of the Annang Nwommo tradition (Salmons 1980) and the Oron Ekpu sculptures (Nicklin 1981). 3. Ejagham pots collected by Talbot are in the Museum of Mankind, London; Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery; and Worcester Museum and Art Gallery 4. A description of traditional pottery production and dis- tribution in southeast Nigeria has been given by Keith Nicklin (1981). Nicklin has suggested that more information could be collected in the middle Cross River area, for example among the Agoi and Bahumuno peoples of Obubra, where isolated pockets of Ejagham-related ritual pottery tradition may still have survived (personal com- munication).
