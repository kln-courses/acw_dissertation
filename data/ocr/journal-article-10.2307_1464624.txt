Harvard University Press, 1989. 204 pages. $20.00. The subject of these Charles Eliot Norton lectures is one that has haunted Harold Bloom's critical and theoretical writings from the beginning, as even mere titles like Shelley's Mythmaking, Blake's Apocalypse, The Visionary Company, or The Breaking of the Vessels-if not The Anxiety of Influence-make plain. If Romanticism has been his central--or nuclear--concern, it is fact largely because the problematic relationship between imagination and belief as modes of cognition is central to this pivotal movement in European literary history, described by Bloom as a "visionary scepticism" or "faithless faith." Coinciden- tally, Bloom's critical thinking has been increasingly informed by Gnosticism and the Kabbalah, their dialectics of earliness and lateness, plenitude and par- ticularity, original and commentary, as well as by the transcendentalism of Emerson, on the one hand, and the psychomachia of Freud, on the other. In The Breaking of the Vessels (1982), Bloom had located the prototype of his "ago- nistic" theory of literary creation as mortal struggle with a literary father figure or "precursor," first developed in The Anxiety of Influence (1973), in the story of Jacob wrestling with the angel and wresting from him the usurping name of Israel and had juxtaposed it with Freud's etiology of sexuality. Ruin the Sacred Truths represents a consolidation of this dynamics of literary history, an attempt, in a series of meditations on the Hebrew Bible (the J narratives, Jer- emiah, Job, and Jonah, what Bloom calls the "four J writers"), Homer, Virgil and Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Blake and Wordsworth, Freud, Kafka, and Beckett to erect his own variant of what an earlier Norton Lecturer, Northrop Frye, once called, in Dylan Thomas' phrase, "Verticals of Adam." It should be noted at the outset, however, that the subtitle of the book, "Poetry and Belief," while an odd coupling to begin with-neither Goethe's "Dichtung und Wahrheit" nor Arnold's, and Wordsworth's, "Poetry and Reli- gion"-is also ironic and potentially misleading. Though poetry and belief are said to be antithetical modes of knowledge (12), unresolvable (4), and unresolved even in Dante (39), belief remains vague throughout and for large stretches of the argument disappears from notice as thoroughly as it is crypti- cally said to vanish from the second half of the Aeneid (38). The real subject of the lectures is signalized in the supertitle. The phrase is taken from a poem by Marvell prefixed to the second edition of Paradise Lost in which Marvell voices (and then dispels) a fear that in writing an epic about sacred history Milton 479</page><page sequence="2">480 Journal of the American Academy of Religion might "ruin (for I saw him strong)/The sacred Truths to Fable and old Song." The point of the allusion is the centrally Bloomian one that, Marvell's timid reassurances notwithstanding, all strong poetry-Milton's included-is a cata- strophic creation that usurps (or "transumes") the authority of its predecessors, whether sacred scripture or secular canon. Belief by that account becomes merely a "weak misreading of literature" (54), reading on one's knees, as it were, obedient assent to the authority of facts and norms, and thus a mere foil for Bloom's agonistic view of poetry as creative "misprision" and therefore "never obedient" (106). Where Matthew Arnold, in The Study of Poetry, had put his faith in poetry over religion because "religion has materialized itself in the ... supposed fact ... and now the fact is failing it," whereas for poetry "the idea is the fact," Bloom finds attachment to ideas as suspect as any other "fac- ticity." Religion for Bloom, as for Blake, is "forms of worship ... chosen from poetic tales" (168)--spilled poetry, to invert T.E. Hulme's apothegm about Romanticism. All "strong" poets, whether Dante, or Milton, or Blake, must ruin the sacred truths because the condition of poetic strength is that the new song, one's own, must be a song of one's self, whether the song be called The Divine Comedy, or Paradise Lost, or Milton. "Every sacred truth not one's own becomes a fable, an old song, that requires corrective vision" (125). Accordingly, Bloom reads Virgil mainly for his oedipal struggle with Homer that wrests originality from belatedness at the crushing cost of creating an ogress like Juno. Dante's Comedy is neither "an allegory of the theologians" nor a "spiritual autobiography" a la Augustine but the heroic agon of a "pretematurally strong" poet (49) overcoming the poetic fatherhood of both Virgil and Augustine and creating himself by his own audacious fiction- presented-as-fact and the self-made revelation and heretical mytho-poesis of Beatrice. For Milton, in turn, belief is simply the "liberty exercised by his own pure heart" (91) because, as Bloom's paradigm of the strong poet's "refusal of belatedness," the egotistical sublime raised to theomorphic proportions, Milton "transumes everybody"-before Moses was, I am, as it were. Like his own hero (!) Satan, Milton "know[s] none before [him], self-begot, self-raised"- though as a vital monist and foe of "every dualism, whether Platonic, Pauline, or Cartesian," he repudiates Satan's manicheanism, "an unfallen Satan, a Luci- fer ... and ... still the morning and evening star of the poetry in our language" (113). Virgil and Dante mainly serve to modify Bloom's earlier thesis of "antitheti- cal" poetry as an essentially post-Miltonic phenomenon; Shakespeare, Homer, and the Biblical writers, by contrast, challenge, as "originals" without demon- strable precursors, Bloom's "antithetical" poetics. Given Bloom's Romantic reading of Milton's Satan as the prototype, albeit a fallen one, of the "strong" poet, God and Christ, the prime objects of normative Christian belief, appear of necessity correspondingly inverted, one as an "ill-tempered, sanctimonious bore" (112), and both as poetic disasters (105f.). Analogously, what engages Bloom's imagination in the God of the Hebrew Bible is not the Priestly deity but the "weird" and "uncanny" (in the sense appropriated from Freud) Yahweh of</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 481 the Yahwist or J Writer (whose hypothetical existence Bloom assumes rather cavalierly, along with the "hypothesis Homer" [3]-the Yahweh who makes Adam from clay, the murderous attacker of Moses, the quasi-rapist and pain-in- the-gut of Jeremiah, the Kafkaesque ironist of Job and Jonah. J is for Bloom the "great original" and "primal author" (22, 3), eccentric, fictive, anterior to belief, who "created Yahweh, even though [he] did not invent him." J is often called anthropomorphic: Bloom calls him "theomorphic" (as he does Milton) and juxtaposes him with the "anthropomorphic" Homer, the other great origi- nal, whose poetry is greater only because, as the "essence of poetry," it is also the essence of unbelief (34). As for Shakespeare, Bloom finds in him the abso- lute sources of modem, subjective consciousness: in Hamlet, who "father[s] himself" (64), in lago's negative swerve ("I am not what I am") from the Bibli- cal I AM THAT I AM (66f.), in Lear as un-Jobean Job, above all in Falstaff, who both fathers and mothers himself, a man without superego, the "essence of invention, which is the essence of poetry," in whom Shakespeare "reverses the New Testament" (86, 84). In the chapter on "Enlightenment and Romanticism," Bloom revises his own earlier heroic conception of Blake vis-a-vis both Milton and Wordsworth, viewing him now as a "pre-Romantic" caught between truth and meaning, who "could not ruin the sacred truths, either to fable and old song, or to a story that might emerge clearly from the abyss of his own strong ego," and who therefore remains "the last of the old race of poets," while Wordsworth emerges as the first and most original of the modems, "more modem than Freud, more post- modem than Samuel Beckett or Thomas Pynchon, because Wordsworth alone found the new way, our way alas, to ruin sacred truths" (129-30). Like Freud after him, Wordsworth replaced "a dying god with a new one, the god of the perpetually growing inner self . .. thus completing the Enlightenment's pro- gram of internalizing all values" (132). Whereas Blake now seems to Bloom to be falling from poetry back towards belief, belief in the Wordsworth of the great decade "can only be belief in the imaginative strength of one's own divine childhood" (137). The Prelude "completes the work of Paradise Lost in destroy- ing the distinction between sacred and secular poetry" and apotheotizing the poet's "own exalted sublimity . . . emancipated from any representation that could inhibit the fully imagined self" (139). Wordsworth thus serves, like Dante and Milton, as witness to Bloom's monist scandal that all writing is scripture and vice versa, that poetry therefore is at once secular and sacred (4) and valid belief can only be (in) poetry-an implicit polemic against Northrop Frye's dualist view of literature as "secular scripture." The study, not unsurprisingly, converges in a lengthy meditation on Freud, whose myth of the primal totemic parricide and its late Biblical rifacimento in Moses and Monotheism furnishes Bloom's ultimate paradigm for his theory of writing as agonistic repression, introjection, and "transumption" of the precur- sor; and on Kafka, Bloom's model of the Jewish writer, only more heretic than the Catholic Dante and the Protestant Milton (should one add, the [algnostic Bloom?) in that he "believed nothing and trusted only in the covenant of being</page><page sequence="4">482 Journal of the American Academy of Religion a writer" (186). This section is in fact a reprint-with some additions--of two of the threee lectures published earlier under the title The Strong Light of the Canonical- Kafka, Freud, and Gershom Scholem as Revisionists ofJewish Culture and Thought (1987). The debate between poetry and belief here emerges most openly as a synecdoche for the critic's own oedipal struggle with orthodoxy. Freud is the prototype both of the modem intellectual and of the Jewish intel- lectual, who both slays Yahweh-and Judaism-and internalizes Him/it as the superego: "Sigmund Freud ... always appears in my own dreams as Yahweh the Father" (106). Even more drastically Kafka embodies the "postnormative Jewish dilemma" in a radically negative vision that "evades the categories of both belief and poetry" (188), both truth and meaning, and therefore also artic- ulates the "necessary failure of interpretation" (189). Yet Freud and Kafka in their very denial of all transcendence appear as the heirs of a Jewish revolt against outwardness and authority that goes back as far as Jeremiah. Kafka's covenant of pure writing emerges as the late, bleak corollary of Jeremiah's New Covenant of inwardness. In a world so emptied, criticism, too, cannot but wander about "between truth and meaning" (4, 187), self-created like Satan and/or self-destroyed like Kafka's Gregor Samsa. But is Satan the only alternative to Samsa? Like all of Bloom's writings, Ruin is at once brilliantly provocative and "antithetical" and also merely provoking, provoking in its airiness, contrariness, and unrestrained subjectivity. To look for contextual documentation in Bloom's wiredrawn "psycho-esthetics" is, perhaps, like looking for mutton in a ginshop, to quote his early master Shelley. But man does not live by gin alone. When, as else- where, Bloom, in his Blakean vein, proclaims himself of the Devil's party-"I find in [Satan] all my own best qualities" (99)-it ought to be remembered that he represents Satan not only as the archetype of the self-begotten strong poet (and critic) who gives birth to his own father but also, in the Map ofMisreading, as "the Grand Solipsist." Watching Bloom beget and rebeget himself and his fathers on his texts is a bit like watching director's theater. Criticism in his hands becomes a displaced Protestantism, a Nietzschean will to power over the text, and thus itself a ruining of sacred truth. As such his tropical discourse really is another kind of poetry, a demiurgic "lie against time," that cannot compel belief beyond admiration. "Our bloom is gone," the book concludes (punningly?) with a line from Wallace Stevens; "we are the fruit thereof" (204). The fruit, however, seems often as tantalizingly deferred as the bloom is tropically persistent. Ernest Bemhardt-Kabisch Indiana University</page></plain_text>
