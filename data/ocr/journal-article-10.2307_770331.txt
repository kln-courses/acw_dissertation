Visconde de Souza Franco 1237, Edificio 'Visconti', Apto 902, 66.053-000 Belem, Para, Brazil tBiology Department, Imperial College at Silwood Park, Ascot, Berkshire SL5 7PY, UK Percy Cyril Claude Garnham was born in London on 15 January 1901 and died in Buckinghamshire on Christmas Day 1994, within three weeks of his 94th birthday and only seven days before he and his wife were to celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary. Sadly, his wife Esther died a few months later. His family life was as fruitful as his long and distinguished scientific career as arguably the foremost protozoologist of his day. He and Esther are survived by six children, 19 grandchildren and 30 great-grandchildren. Cyril, as he was known to his close friends, was one of the few remaining 'traditional parasitologists' whose passionate interest centres on parasites themselves rather than any disease they might cause, and on the morphology, biology and taxonomy of protozoal parasites in general rather than on the molecular biology, immunology, biochemistry and genetics of a handful of protozoal parasites of man, the study of which dominates present-day parasitology. Thus, the opening words of his magnificent book Malaria parasites and other Haemosporidia (14)t advise the reader that 'This is a book about malaria parasites and not malaria'. During his long career another 'new discipline' to arrive on the scene was electronmicroscopy, then a somewhat mystic process. Gamnham seized on it to answer specific questions regarding his major object of study, the life cycle of the malaria parasite, rather than merely to join an increasing throng of workers whose obsession it was to put as many protozoa as possible under the electron microscope. Thus, in recounting this work (16), he wrote 'The process of maturation of the microgametocyte with the production of gametes obviously constitutes a ~Numbers in this form refer to the bibliography at the end of the text. ? 1997 The Royal Society 173</page><page sequence="2">t</page><page sequence="3">Biographical Memoirs fundamental aspect of the life-cycle of the malaria parasite, and the determination of the fine structure of the stages concerned was thought to be of basic importance'. His EM studies of these showed, for the first time, that the haemosporine gamete 'is more comparable to a simplified spermatozoon than a flagellated protozoon such as Bodo or Trypanosoma'. EARLY YEARS Cyril Garnham's father, Lieutenant Percy Claude Garnham, served in the Royal Naval Regiment (the forerunner of the Commandos) and was killed during land-fighting at Gallipoli in 1915. Cyril and his three sisters were cared for by his mother, an artistic and strong-willed woman who was an accomplished violinist. Not surprisingly he grew up in an atmosphere rich in music, art and literature, and became an excellent pianist. In later life, he said his ambition as a young man was to become a professional musician, but whether or not he would have been successful we will never know. There seems to have been little doubt in his mother's mind that he would not, for she firmly dashed young Cyril's hopes by telling him that his hands were too small for him to have any chance of becoming a concert pianist of any worth. Nonetheless, he continued music lessons from the age of 6 to 21, and he retained his love of music and prowess on the piano for the rest of his life. During his secondary school education at the Paradise School, London, Cyril Garnham had his first taste of science, and chemistry became his favourite subject. He was given a chemistry set as a birthday present and a small room at home in which to carry out his experiments. These were carefully recorded in his notebook, but his boyish enthusiasm soon waned as a result of his frequent failure to produce the chemical end-product advertised with the chemistry set. When he did get a positive result he was sadly disillusioned by the minute amount of material the reactions produced. Later, he realized that his little chemistry set had at least provided him with a good indication of the way that most research usually goes, with a considerable number of negative results! At the early age of 16, Cyril Gamham began studies at the Medical School of St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and he obtained his M.B., B.S., M.R.C.S. and L.R.C.P. in 1923. In 1924 he took the Diploma of Public Health, largely, he later admitted, because it was the last opportunity to take the course in only three months instead of one year. When he was 23, Garnham married Esther Long Price, the second daughter of the late Reverend John Price, who was Master of the Hunt of Talley House Harriers and vicar of the St Michael's Church, Talley. The Long Price family, of ancient Welsh origin, had occupied Talley House, Carmarthenshire, for three centuries, and Esther was a direct descendant of Robert Peel, founder of the London Metropolitan Police Force. Cyril Garnham is buried in the graveyard of the church, near Lampeter, Wales, where Esther's father had been vicar. Cyril and Esther's marriage was an eminently successful and happy partnership that lasted almost 70 years. They had six children, two boys and four girls. During the Second World War, three of the children were stranded in the UK, with their parents unable to return from Kenya until the end of hostilities. This speaks much for the devotion and stamina of Esther, a young, newly wed woman, in a small bungalow lit by oil lamps and candles who must have found life in Africa a far cry from that in her native Wales. Of the children, John Claude was the only one to enter the medical profession. 174</page><page sequence="4">Percy Cyril Claude Garnham Figure 1. P.C.C. Gamham with students, 1952. Left to right: R. Lainson F.R.S., John R. Baker, M. Rifaat, S. Grewal, F. I. Awad. CAREER Cyril Gamham's major interests during his final years at Barts were neurology and psychiatry. Neurology particularly appealed to the scientific mind, he felt, 'because of its logical methods, the beautiful histology of the brain on which it is based, and the challenge it offers both as regards the aetiology and the treatment of nervous diseases'. He found 'the exactitude of neurological diagnosis' contrasted with the 'woolly "left and right-sided" heart-failure of the cardiologist'. In 1924 young Gamham tried, unsuccessfully, to get a job in the Queen's Square Hospital for Nervous Diseases. Then, driven by his childhood interest in all aspects of natural history, he applied for the post of Medical Officer on a Colonial Office Discovery expedition to the Antarctic. The position was already filled, but he was offered another with the Colonial Medical Service in Kenya. Although disappointed, he accepted it, later admitting that since he was about to marry, the Kenyan post was 'perhaps a little bit more practical'. Little did he realize the extent of Nature's riches that were available to him in Africa, or the far-reaching effects his work was to have on tropical medicine and parasitology, particularly malariology. Cyril and Esther were married on 31 December 1924, and set off for Kenya, arriving in Kisumu in January 1925. On starting work, Garnham was bemused by the lack of any fixed routine for him to follow. He was never enthusiastic about administration and had little interest in the execution of public health or sanitation procedures that threatened to take up 175</page><page sequence="5">Biographical Memoirs much of his time. To condemn meat after finding four or more Taenia cysts in it, but passing it as fit for human consumption when only three were discovered struck him as 'stupidly illogical'. Ships coming from Tanganyika had to be inspected and certified as free of plague or smallpox, an activity that often made unwelcome inroads into both his scientific and leisure activities. One such interruption of a tennis tournament prompted him to ask his wife to go down to the ship and bring him the certificate to sign, an act of outrageous irregularity which incurred the wrath of his superiors and the ship's captain. That Gamnham conscientiously dedicated considerable time to his official duties is apparent, however, from the few papers- 24-that he published during his 22 years in Africa. What they lacked in number they made up for in variety, ranging in subject matter from Rift Valley fever to malaria epidemics. Cyril Garnham's predecessor, Dr H.S. Boer, had worked exhaustively on malaria control, and Cyril inherited a system that was as up-to-date as possible at that time. In addition to continuing this scheme of control, Gamham immersed himself in a study of the human disease and the ecology of the local mosquito species. Numerous cases of relapsing fever also stimulated a deep interest in this disease and his first scientific paper was on the susceptibility of the tick vector, Ornithodorus, to fire (1). He found plague in local rats and investigated flea infestations in animal hides and cotton seed transported across Lake Victoria from neighbouring countries as a source of infection. In 1927 the Garnhams returned for a 9-month stay in England for Cyril to prepare his M.D. thesis on malaria in Kisumu at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (L.S.H.T.M.). He had not only to present a thesis but also to undergo oral and written examinations in tropical medicine, so, feeling that he was poorly equipped for this, Garnham attended the courses in that subject at the L.S.H.T.M. He passed the M.D. with flying colours and his examiner, Dr Christophosan, was so impressed by the thesis that he nominated Garnham for the Gold Medal of London University for the best student. This surprised Cyril, who was quite convinced that he had failed. Among his teachers at the L.S.H.T.M. were Gordon Thompson, Castellani and Patrick Buxton, F.R.S., all of whom played important roles in moulding Garnham's future career. On his return to Africa, Cyril Garnham was posted to Mombassa as the District Medical Officer with his major duties again in the field of public health. This time his predecessor's claim to fame was the installation of latrines in all the native huts, which had gained him prestige in the eyes of the Colonial Office and of which he was extremely proud. Much to the vexation of London, Garnham showed no interest in lavatories and plunged once more into malaria and mosquitoes, becoming 'more and more an entomologist'. After six months in Mombassa, he went as Medical Officer to Nairobi, where he made original observations on peculiar erythrocytic lesions produced by developing gametocytes of Plasmodiumfalciparum. In October 1931 Garnham obtained study leave enabling him to spend time in the laboratories of three great figures in the field of malariology: Nicolaas Swellengrebel in Amsterdam, Emile Brumpt in Paris and Alberto Missiroli in Rome. He was particularly influenced by Swellengrebel's malaria control and found him 'a most charming man'. Missiroli he found to be somewhat 'unapproachable', possibly because of Cyril's poor knowledge of Italian. In Missiroli's laboratory Garnham met Giulio Raffaele, who later discovered the exoerythrocytic schizogony of Plasmodium in goldfinches infected with P. elongatum, an historic observation that greatly influenced Garnham's future research. Without doubt, however, Cyril regarded Emile Brumpt as his principal mentor, and Emile's son, Lucien, became a lifelong friend. 176</page><page sequence="6">Percy Cyril Claude Garnham Figure 2.

Symes, who created the entomology section of the Medical Research Laboratories in Nairobi. In 1931 Cyril amalgamated this with his malaria research section to establish the Division of Insect Borne Diseases (now the Division of Vector Borne Diseases), and followed Symes as Director when his friend left for military service. Garnham continued in this post until 1947, during which time he worked on a remarkably wide range of subjects, including yellow fever and other viral infections, plague and relapsing fever. Research on protozoal parasites dominated his studies, however, especially the haemosporines of lizards, birds and mammals, and particularly the malaria parasites of man, and his deep entomological interests led to important studies on mosquitoes, black flies and ticks. Notable achievements were his classical study of Hepatocystis kochi, and the local eradication of onchocerciasis. After retiring from the Colonial Medical Service in 1947, Gamham returned to England, where he was appointed Reader in Medical Protozoology in the Department of Medical Parasitology at the L.S.H.T.M. The Department was headed by Professor H.E. Shortt, F.R.S., with whom he made his historic discovery of the exoerythrocytic schizonts of mammalian malaria parasites. In 1952, when Shortt retired, Garnham was appointed Professor of Medical Protozoology in the University of London and Head of the Department of Parasitology at the L.S.H.T.M., a post he held until his retirement in 1968. This was the most prolific period of his scientific life and, in those 16 years he was an author of 132 papers. The subject matter was extraordinarily varied, including viruses, plague, malaria parasites, leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis, microsporidia and onchocerciasis. 177</page><page sequence="7">Biographical Memoirs Gamham's major interest during his time at the L.S.H.T.M remained malaria, and many of his staff and students found themselves inexorably drawn into a series of masterfully planned experiments (sometimes as guinea-pigs) which revealed the exoerythrocytic stages of two human and six simian parasites. Among his co-workers during this work were J.R. Baker, R.S. Bray, A.S. Dissanaike, A.E Gunders, R. Killick-Kendrick, R. Lainson, F.R.S., Miss M. Maryon, Mrs Pathmathevy Nelson, P.G. Shute and James Williamson. William Cooper, then Class Demonstrator of the Department, assisted with most of the experiments and was the volunteer who, in 1954, provided a piece of liver in which exoerythrocytic schizonts of P.ovale were first demonstrated. Garnham was particularly appreciative of Cooper's skills and dedication and, in an the obituary following his assistant's sudden death in 1964, he wrote: 'Nobody is said to be irreplaceable; this statement is untrue of Cooper, whose death leaves a gap which can never be filled' (11). In 1961 and 1962 Gamham took sabbatical leave to write his magnum opus on malaria parasites. He was anxious to improve his Italian to consult the works of the Italian malariologists in the original and went to the Clinica delle Malattie Tropicale e Subtropicale at the University of Naples, where he was given laboratory facilities, and to the Stazione Zoologica di Napoli, where he had access to the library and a collection of old papers in Italian. He visited Italy again in 1968, when he went to the Villa Serbelloni to prepare his Heath Clark Lectures (19) for publication, and yet again in 1974 when he organized an Italo-British epidemiological investigation to study an outbreak of visceral leishmaniasis in Emilia Romagna. Gamham never really retired: he simply relocated his laboratory and replanned his work accordingly. The third stage came with his official retirement in 1968 when, as Emeritus Professor of Protozoology, University of London, he became a Senior Research Fellow at Imperial College at Silwood Park, Ascot, accompanied by four Ph.D. students. Here he accumulated the Gamham Collection of Malaria Parasites and other Haemosporidia, which involved much travel abroad, including numerous adventurous trips in conditions that would have daunted many younger men. Since his youth, Garnham had been fascinated by mysticism and the occult. He had a great admiration for the works of Edgar Allen Poe and, when he left Imperial College and 'retired' for the third time in 1980, he started writing a book about him, which he had almost completed before he died. In typical Garnham research fashion he made a point of visiting many of the places where Poe had lived, doubtless to obtain atmosphere for the book. Another unfinished work was a book entitled The path of a research worker that he started writing with his old friend from his days in Kenya, Ronald Heisch. Alas, on Heisch's premature death in 1970 Gamnham lost heart in this endeavour, and did not resume work on it until 20 years later. The manuscript contains a wealth of fascinating thoughts and anecdotes from a man who had dedicated 70 years of his life to research in parasitology. SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS Malaria parasites The name of Cyril Garnham will remain in the annals of parasitology for all time because of his work on the exoerythrocytic stages of malaria parasites. He began with a common malaria- like parasite of African monkeys, then known as Plasmodium kochi Laveran, on which he worked in Kenya continuously for 13 years (1934-47), with the last four devoted to a search for the tissue forms. The only stages in the blood are gametocytes, and the division stages 178</page><page sequence="8">Percy Cyril Claude Garnham (schizonts) were then unknown.

These were merocysts of Hepatocystes Figure 3. A page from P.C.C. Gamrnham's notebook (hesi sime Levadisti an. . H ep an ocy with sketches of merocysts of Hepatocystis kochi. (sic) simiae Levaditi and Schoen, and Garnham suddenly realized that they were the elusive asexual multiplication forms of the parasite in the blood known as P. kochi. He revised the taxonomy and corrected the name to Hepatocystis kochi. Cyril sent sections of the merocysts to the great English protozoologist, C.M. Wenyon, F.R.S., who insisted he should return immediately to England and demonstrate them. Cyril published a preliminary note on his observations in 1947 (2). While living in Kenya, Cyril failed to find the vector of H. kochi in spite of attempts to demonstrate the full sporogony in midges, phlebotomine sand flies, four genera of mosquitoes, reduviid bugs, lice and even blood-sucking nematodes. The search became an obsession and, after retiring from Kenya in 1947 until 1959, Garnham seized every opportunity to go back and continue the quest. His persistence was crowned with success when, with R.B. Heisch and D.M. Minter, he found that the complete cycle took place in a midge, Culicoides adersi, with, surprisingly, development of the oocysts in the haemocoele, particularly in the head near the brain and eyes. By the end of the Second World War, Garnham's interest in the exoerythrocytic schizogony of malaria parasites was shared by malariologists throughout the world. In 1934, his Italian friend Giulio Raffaele (1936) had discovered the tissue stages of the avian malaria parasite, P. elongatum, in the reticuloendothelial and haemopoetic cells of infected goldfinches, and had suggested that similar forms might exist in the life cycle of other malaria parasites. Raffaele's 179</page><page sequence="9">Biographical Memoirs observations were confirmed in the 1940s in studies on related species of avian plasmodia by other workers, notably Reichenow in Germany and Huff in the USA, who independently demonstrated a primary exoerythrocytic schizogony in the mesodermal cells of the skin that was initiated by sporozoites. Another reason for the interest in tissue stages came from studies by Sir Neil Hamilton Fairly, F.R.S., who, working in Australia, infected human volunteers with P vivax and P falciparum by the bites of experimentally infected mosquitoes and then transfused 200-500 ml of their blood into other volunteers from a few minutes tolO days after the bites. He found that the blood was infective for 30-60 min and was then non-infective until the eighth day with P vivax, and the sixth day with P falciparum. This gave irrefutable evidence of a cryptic third cycle of two malaria parasites of man. Until this time, a curiously fallacious observation by Fritz Schaudinn had dominated the thinking of malariologists. In 1903 Schaudinn claimed to have seen sporozoites of P vivax entering erythrocytes and, because of his great international reputation as the discoverer of the causative organism of syphilis, this initial part of the life cycle was believed to be true for nearly half a century. But if Schaudinn had been right, the blood of Hamilton Fairley's volunteers should have been constantly infective. Many vain attempts to repeat Schaudinn's observations had already thrown doubt on his work, and Hamilton Fairley's studies in Australia administered the final blow. It was natural that Garnham and Shortt should turn their attentions to this problem when Cyril took up his appointment as Reader at the L.S.H.T.M. in 1947. Garnham was preparing a full account of the tissue schizogony of H. kochi (3) and Shortt had earlier studied the exoerythrocytic schizogony of P. gallinaceum. As their model for an investigation of the occult part of the life cycle of mammalian malaria, they chose P. cynomolgi, which is a simian analogue of the human malaria parasite, P vivax. The plan was simple: it was to administer an extraordinarily high number of sporozoites to a small rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) and look for parasites in the spleen, liver, kidney, suprarenal gland, pancreas, small intestine, lymph glands, aorta, inferior vena cava, peritoneal exudate, peritoneum, lungs, heart, thoracic glands, bone marrow, brain, leg muscles, pia mater and omentum! On 12 December 1947 they fed hundreds of infected mosquitoes on the animal, then ground up the mosquitoes and inoculated the suspension of sporozoites intraperitoneally and intramuscularly. The autopsy was done seven days later, when they knew from previous work that parasites would be first demonstrable in the circulating blood. In view of Cyril's discovery of the exoerythrocytic stages of H. kochi in the liver of monkeys, it is surprising that this organ was not examined first: it was, in fact, the last to be searched. In a tape-recorded interview made on 30 May 1985, Garnham gave the story on the examination of the tissues. He was 'particularly obsessed by James and Tate's experiments with bird malaria, and other people too, who had found the exoerythrocytic forms of avian malaria ... in the various organs' and he thought the probable site of development was in reticuloendothelial cells. He was greatly surprised when, on 9 January 1948, large schizonts measuring up to 30 Mtm in the parenchymal cells of the liver were seen to be practically identical to the immature forms of H. kochi. Garnham was fond of pointing out that such a cycle had been predicted at the beginning of the century by the great Italian malariologist, Battista Grassi. At the first opportunity, Shortt and Garnham walked along Gower Street to the Wellcome Museum to show the sections to the then doyen of protozoology, C.M. Wenyon, who was thrilled with their discovery and confirmed that the schizonts in the liver must indeed be multiplication stages of the parasite which preceded the invasion of the blood. Could Schaudinn really have seen sporozoites entering erythrocytes? The next step was obvious: it was to demonstrate the primary exoerythrocytic stages in 180</page><page sequence="10">Percy Cyril Claude Garnham malaria parasites of man.

Although all four of the species of malaria parasites of man causedFIGURE 4. P.C.C. Garnham as a medical student parasites of man cause disease, P. , falciparum is by far the most important because of its high pathogenicity. With some trepidation because of the danger of experimentally infecting a human volunteer, Shortt and Garnham decided that another experiment must be attempted with this parasite. Their work was now well known, and a volunteer, Mr C. Howard, presented himself with the wish to help in the research on malaria. After intensive briefing of Howard and a considerable struggle with bureaucracy, the experiment was successfully done in collaboration with Hamilton Fairley, Covell and Shute, and a description of the tissue stages was published in 1949 (5). When Cyril succeeded Shortt as Head of the Department of Parasitology in 1952, the exoerythrocytic stages of two of the four malaria parasites of man (P. ovale and P. malariae) remained unknown. As these parasites were rarely used in malaria therapy, they were much more difficult to study than the other two. Within nine months of taking over the Department, Cyril Garnham had tracked down a priest who had returned from Liberia infected with P. ovale. His strain was passed by blood inoculation to a patient with Reiter's syndrome and another with nephrosis before being passaged into Garnham himself, in the hope of producing gametocytes with which to infect mosquitoes and produce sporozoites for the demonstration of tissue stages. But in vain: 10 days later Cyril developed a fever which he endured for seven days and, although parasites appeared in his blood, there were never enough gametocytes to infect more than 8 per cent of the mosquitoes. He had anticipated that one volunteer would not be enough, and had four more standing by from his Department (R.S. Bray, F.I. Awad, 181</page><page sequence="11">Biographical Memoirs R. Lainson and J. Williamson). The infection was passed along this line and in two patients undergoing malaria therapy, either by blood passage or by the bites of poorly infected mosquitoes. Finally, just as it seemed the experiment would have to be abandoned, Williamson developed a gametocytaemia sufficient to infect 77 per cent of 900 mosquitoes. On 18, 19 and 22 December 1953, William Cooper received almost 1000 bites from mosquitoes that had been infected on Williamson and, 9 days after the first bite, he was subjected to a laparotomy and the removal of about 10 g of liver. On his recovery from the operation, Cooper prepared sections of his own liver in which were found about two exoerythrocytic schizonts per gram of tissue, which Cooper himself later illustrated with beautiful watercolour paintings. Garnham thought that an experiment with a human volunteer was not justified to demonstrate the tissue schizogony of the fourth human malaria parasite (P malariae), which is a parasite of chimpanzees and gorillas as well as man and, to this day, no experiments with human volunteers have been done with this parasite. While working in Liberia, R.S. Bray had described the early tissue schizonts of P. malariae in the liver of a chimpanzee in 1960, but Cyril wanted to see the fully mature stages because he believed that this part of the life cycle was of great taxonomic importance, particularly the morphology of mature stages and the time of maturation. P malariae is not an easy parasite with which to work in the laboratory; few gametocytes are produced and it is difficult to obtain heavily infected mosquitoes and thus abundant sporozoites. Garnham learned that Lupascu and his colleagues in Rumania were using a strain of P. malariae for malaria therapy and that, by subinoculating blood from patients infected by sporozoites into other subjects, they had shown that the length of the prepatent period was 15 days. He at once proposed a joint experiment to demonstrate the late tissue stages in the liver of a chimpanzee (17). Laboratory-bred mosquitoes (Anopheles labranchiae atroparvus) were fed on a patient under treatment in Rumania and flown to London. On 28 June 1966, salivary glands of the mosquitoes were dissected out, and a suspension of sporozoites was inoculated into a splenectomized chimpanzee. Cyril then took biopsies of liver at open operation on 10, 11, 12 and 13 July, and obtained a series of schizonts from the day Bray had seen them to maturity. The animal stood up remarkably well to the series of operations and, when Garnham asked his staff to remove the stitches, they found that the chimpanzee had done it for them on exactly the day planned. By the time Cyril left L.S.H.T.M. in 1968, he had demonstrated the tissue schizonts of a whole range of simian malaria parasites, including P. knowlesi, P. inui, P. brasilianum, P. gonderi, P c. bastianellii and P. c. ceylonensis. This detailed study reinforced Gamham's doubts about the currently held theory of the part exoerythrocytic schizonts played in relapses in malaria caused by P.vivax and related parasites, a phenomenon that was recognized by Hippocrates in 400 bc and had for centuries remained a mystery. In recent times, lack of agreement between workers on relapses was largely due to misunderstandings about the differences between relapses and recrudescences. In many publications, Garnham pointed out that whereas recrudescences are renewed clinical attacks with parasites remaining in the blood in the intervals, relapses are separate episodes with no parasites in the circulation between attacks. Garnham's profound understanding of the taxonomy and biology of malaria parasites led him prophetically to suggest that true relapses were a feature of only Plasmodium vivax and related parasites. When the exoerythrocytic schizonts of primate malaria parasites were discovered in 1948, Shortt thought that the persistence of this cycle could perhaps be responsible for relapses. 182</page><page sequence="12">Percy Cyril Claude Garnham Support for this idea came from the finding by Shortt and Garnham (4) of a tissue schizont of Plasmodium cynomolgi in the liver of a monkey 102 days after the inoculation of sporozoites and just before a relapse. It was assumed that a few merozoites released by the schizont were histiotropic and, instead of invading red cells, they entered parenchymal cells and thus initiated a new cycle that was presumed to be unaffected by the immune response of the host. This idea, the 'Shortt-Gamham theory', was defended by Shortt until his death at the age of 100 years. Garnham, on the other hand, began progressively to doubt this explanation in the face of the opposing views of Sir Neil Hamilton Fairley and others. Finally, he became convinced that the Shortt-Garnham theory was no longer tenable, and in 1966 he published a critical account of four possible explanations of relapses (15). He concluded 'The fourth theory assumes the existence of a latent stage, either of the sporozoite itself or of the primary exoerythrocytic schizont. There is scarcely any direct evidence in support of the theory, but it certainly accords with the facts of the life cycle of the parasite, ... and I feel that here lies the true explanation of the phenomenon.' This became a recurring theme in his publications and was clearly occupying his thoughts for many years. The first light was thrown on this mystery, as Cyril liked to call it, when he studied patterns of infection of a North Korean strain of P. vivax in volunteers given intradermal inoculations of known numbers of sporozoites. Recipients of low numbers had no primary attack, but had fever and parasites in the blood precisely at the time a relapse was expected (23). He felt this could only be explained by assuming that there were two kinds of sporozoites, one which developed quickly and another which lay latent, and that the North Korean strain produced predominantly the latter. This fitted the natural history of the parasite, which could be transmitted only during the summer. It followed that a tropical strain, with transmission throughout the year, would not behave in the same way. In collaboration with Ungureanu and Branzei in Rumania and Shute, Maryon and Killick-Kendrick in England, he therefore repeated the work with the Chesson strain from New Guinea, and found that all volunteers, even those given an estimated dose as low as 10 sporozoites, had a primary attack at the normal time (24). The two experiments suggested that a so-called delayed primary attack and a relapse were one and the same and originated from some stage of the parasite, presumably the sporozoite, in arrested development. The final solution and the discovery of the hypothetical resting stage, later named the hypnozoite by Garnham, came entirely by chance. Thirty years after the publication of the Shortt-Garnham theory, W. Krotoski approached Garnham in Warsaw at the 4th International Congress of Parasitology and proposed a collaboration to examine the early development of primary exoerythrocytic stages using an immunofluorescent technique, which Krotoski and colleagues had shown was excellent for revealing the tissue forms. Garnham formed a team in England to inoculate rhesus monkeys with millions of sporozoites of P. cynomolgi and take liver biopsies at different times. He sectioned and stained some of the livers and sent a duplicate sets to Krotoski in the USA. In liver taken one week after inoculation, Krotoski's colleague David Martin saw tiny, strongly fluorescent bodies that were far too small to be primary 7-day-old exoerythrocytic schizonts. After an exchange of telegrams and phone calls with Garnham, the slides were restained by the conventional Giemsa-Colophonium method and Cyril's suspicion that the latent relapse forms had at last been found was confirmed. As Garnham later wrote (29), the first objective 'to observe the earliest development of sporozoites in the liver was a complete failure! But, instead, in the course of the same experiments, we solved the mystery of relapses, and demonstrated the long-sought after latent stages of the malaria parasite-the hypnozoite-in the parenchyma cells of the liver.' Further 183</page><page sequence="13">Biographical Memoirs joint studies confirmed their findings and extended their observations to related parasites. With few exceptions, it is now accepted that the source of relapses is the hypnozoite, although Shortt (1983) never agreed; Garnham was distressed when he felt obliged to renege on the Shortt-Gamham theory and part ways with his old mentor with whom he had discovered the tissue schizogony of mammalian malaria parasites. Although in many ways Cyril Gamham was a traditionalist, he was always quick to incorporate modem methods in his work. When the transmission electron microscope was introduced into studies of protozoa in the 1950s, he seized on it to illuminate the locomotion of various stages of malaria parasites. Professor R.E. Sinden, one of Cyril's collaborators in this work, writes: Gamham's interest in the structure and function of malaria parasites was founded on an intense curiosity of the nature of parasitism as exemplified by Plasmodium. Early broad-ranging studies were on the morphology of the parasites as seen by classical light microscopic techniques, and this formed the basis of his uniquely authoritative text that remains the bible on the taxonomy of malaria parasites-Malaria parasites and other Haemosporidia-published in 1966. Such was the inspiration of his work that, some six years earlier, he had recognised the remarkable power of the then new technique of electron microscopy. Between 1960 and 1969 with R.G. Bird, J.R. Baker and others, he published seven unique papers on the fine structure of malaria parasites, the first four of which preceded any other publications on this subject. Garnham recognised that the diverse stages of the malaria life cycle represented an alternation in cell function between motile and vegetative phases. His studies focused specifically on the former, and led to an understanding of the ultrastructural homologies between the sporozoite, merozoite and o6kinete and, in particular, the recognition of a group of organelles now collectively termed the apical complex. These included the 'hollow peripheral fibres' (microtubules); 'paired organelles' (the rhoptries, which with typical foresight Gamnham recognised were secretory organelles); a double membraned pellicle; and concentric rings (the apical rings and the microtubule organizing centre). This complex was later seen to be a taxonomic feature defining the Phylum of parasites containing the genus Plasmodium the name of which was changed from Sporozoa to Apicomplexa following Gamham's studies. The later papers of the series presented uncannily accurate studies of the complex events of gametocytogenisis which, considering the rudimentary understanding of cell fixation and processing at that time, were a remarkable achievement. Ten years passed before improvements in techniques permitted any refinement of these pioneering studies. In the last paper of the series, an account was given of the ultrastructure of the pre-erythrocytic schizonts which, of all stages of malaria parasites, were identified with Garnham. Because of the practical difficulties in obtaining these forms, it was two decades before technically superior data were obtained. With the publication of this, the seventh paper in the series, the ultrastructure of every stage of the life cycle known at the time had been studied-a foundation on which future observations were based and one which none of his followers could ever hope to emulate. Considering Gamham's obsession with relapses in malaria, it is ironic that the hypnozoite, the dormant hepatic stage that permits some malaria parasites to span transmission seasons, was the only stage of the life cycle he did not describe by electron microscopy. His pioneering dominance in the ultrastructure of malaria parasites led many young scientists to explore the magical world of subcellular organisation in this diverse and fascinating group of organisms. But they were able to provide only the fine details on the broad canvas Gamnham had already painted. Field research Cyril Gamham constantly emphasized the great importance of field work in all aspects of biology (26). Two of his most arduous but productive field expeditions were made, in fact, at 184</page><page sequence="14">Percy Cyril Claude Garnham a time when most research workers have retired. One, to Amazonian Brazil in 1969, was to search for a malaria parasite of bats seen only once 31 years previously (21), and the other was to Borneo in 1972 to study malaria parasites of the orang utan (20, 25). Personal accounts of these expeditions by the writers are given in an extended version of this Memoir in the archives of the Royal Society. Other parasitic protozoa Garnham was firmly convinced that to be a parasitologist of any worth it was essential to have a good, basic knowledge of all major groups of parasites, not merely of the few organisms that parasitize man. This was reflected in his teaching at the L.S.H.T.M. where Ph.D. students working on human malaria rubbed shoulders with others studying blood parasites of birds, trypanosomes of fish, or coccidia of all manner of creatures. Clinicians questioning the need of such seemingly irrelevant subjects were gently reminded that Ross showed mosquitoes to be the vectors of malaria parasites using a Plasmodium of sparrows, and trypanosomes were discovered in frogs, not man. Gamham's list of 379 publications includes papers on such a wide range of parasitic protozoa that this review can cover no more than the highlights. Malaria parasites of animals other than man Because of Cyril's time as a Medical Officer in East Africa and long association with the L.S.H.T.M., it was natural that much of his research was on malaria of man. He was, however, no less interested in malaria parasites (sensu lato) of other animals and was an author of many publications on such organisms of lizards, snakes, birds, bats, rodents, monkeys, apes, deer and even the hippopotamus. Toxoplasma and related parasites Cyril was intrigued by the enigmatic Toxoplasma and in 1960 he and R. Lainson published on the importance of infected sheep meat as a source of human infection (9). In 1964, at the 7th International Congress on Tropical Medicine and Malaria in Rio de Janeiro, he chaired the first meeting of the Toxoplasma Classification Subcommittee, which continued to meet for many years under his chairmanship at all major international congresses on parasitology. Their discussions undoubtedly played a major part in hastening the discovery in 1970 of the coccidial nature of Toxoplasma. In 1966, Garnham described and named a species of the related genus Besnoitia in lizards in Belize (13) and, four years later, postulated a close relationship between this parasite and Toxoplasma and Sarcocystis based on the ultrastructure of the asexual stages. Haemogregarines and piroplasms Having worked on relapsing fever in Kenya, it was inevitable that Garnham should be interested in other organisms transmitted by ticks. One of his early papers was on the sporogonic stages of a previously undescribed adeileid haemogregarine of lizards, Hepatozoon argantis, in Argus brumpti (7); and another reported a strange new piroplasm, Echinozoon hoogstraali in hyraxes (6). Gamham's interest in piroplasm increased considerably in 1957, when Yugoslavian workers reported the first case of babesiosis in a farmer who died of a fulminating infection 11 years after splenectomy. Although Garnham and three other eminent parasitologists 185</page><page sequence="15">Biographical Memoirs identified the organism as Babesia bovis, sceptics maintained the parasite was Plasmodium falciparum or that the slides had been muddled with some from cattle. From the epidemiological data and his knowledge of the dramatic development of malaria parasites in splenectomized animals, Garnham had no doubts that this was a genuine babesial infection, which caused the death of the patient because he was splenectomized. In 1959, he and R.S. Bray (8) showed that splenectomized chimpanzees developed fulminating infections of Babesia divergens, whereas an intact animal remained without signs, and they suggested that latent piroplasmosis of man might be widespread in rural populations where ticks and infected cattle were abundant. Garnham later took an active part in investigations of human babesiosis due to B. divergens in Ireland and B. microti in the USA. Trypanosoma, Leishmania and related flagellates Garnham professed to have little interest in kinetoplastids, presumably because of their comparatively simple morphology and life cycles, and once jokingly told J.R. Baker that if he found trypanosomes in a blood film he threw it out the window. Nevertheless, his name appears on 33 papers on trypanosomatines, including the species causing African trypanosomiasis of man and game animals; Chagas' disease due to Trypanosoma cruzi; trypanosomes of lizards, turtles, birds, bats, rodents, artiodactyls and monkeys; Crithidia fasciculata of the mosquito Mansonia africana; and Leishmania and leishmaniasis of man and wild animals. He wrote extensively on the last of these subjects and his pioneering studies with D.J. Lewis in Belize on chiclero's ulcer caused by L. mexicana did much to stimulate the interest of other workers in the ecology and epidemiology of the American leishmaniases, which led to a revolution in our understanding of this disease complex. Control of malaria and onchocerciasis To many, Garnham may have seemed to work in an ivory tower on obscure facets of parasitology, with no relevance to tropical public health. Although he stoutly denied any missionary zeal, he was a pioneer in the control of malaria and onchocerciasis (river blindness) in Kenya by attacking the vectors (mosquitoes and black flies respectively) with DDT as soon as it became widely available at the end of the Second World War. The malaria story is told in a public relations film made in Kenya (now in the Wellcome Museum) on the first use of DDT in a rural area in tropical Africa (27). The successful eradication of onchocerciasis in a focus where the disease was so common that the focus was known as the 'country of the blind' was a result of an accident. In Garnham's words: 'In 1946, during the first antimalarial campaign with DDT on a large scale in rural Africa, the emulsion had to be carried on donkeys across rivers and streams. On one occasion a donkey stumbled and the emulsion spilt into the river. We seized the opportunity to discover if the well-known breeding places of ... Simulium species had been eliminated and found that they had been completely destroyed' (28). After a pilot programme, plans for control were laid. There followed nearly three years of intensive field work mapping tributaries, estimating the flow of water and finding black-fly breeding sites. This involved travel over thousands of miles, partly by car but much on foot, and Cyril often paid tribute to the persistence of his colleague, the late J.P. McMahon, without whose stubborn enthusiasm he felt the work would never have been done. Ten years after the episode of the donkey, eradication was achieved and, to this day, the place remains free from river blindness. This result was to have widespread consequences. It inspired French workers 186</page><page sequence="16">Percy Cyril Claude Garnham to attempt large-scale trials to control Simulium damnosum in West Africa where onchocerciasis is much more prevalent than in East Africa. Their success led to an extensive onchocerciasis control programme eventually covering 1.3 million km2 where, after more than 20 years, 30 million people are now free from risk of the disease. The roots of this unique multinational effort in public health can be traced back to Gamham's work in Kenya (Samba 1994). Taxonomy and systematics Cyril Garnham had an uncompromising view of taxonomy: he considered it the essential foundation of all biology. He always advised hesitant students and colleagues to describe and name any parasite or vector they believed to be new. This gave it an identity and, although he would not tolerate bad descriptions, he maintained that it was no shame when a name fell into synonymy. For him, taxonomy was a personal affair and he brusquely dismissed any suggestion that the naming of new species should be agreed by a committee. The test was acceptance by the scientific community. Cyril's first stumbling steps in taxonomy are revealed in a letter he sent to Kiztmiller (1982). He wrote: When I was very young, I was extremely thrilled when I found what was clearly a new species of Anopheles in the Papyrus Swamps near Kisumu and I described it (very badly) in my MD thesis which was subsequently published in abbreviated form. I had sent the material to the late C.B. Symes, who forwarded it to Edwards at the British Museum. Edwards, thinking it came directly from Symes, promptly named it Anopheles symesi. Symes and I were great friends, and he was terribly upset about this occurrence and promptly looked for another new species wanting a name and thus Anopheles garnhami was born. So the names should really have been reversed, but I have always been quite pleased at the substitution. When he moved from the L.S.H.T.M. to Silwood Park in 1968, he spent almost all his time on a seemingly impossible taxonomic task: amassing type and voucher specimens of all malaria parasites. This took him 11 years and culminated in a collection of more than 1000 slides of stages of 200 species of malaria parasites from over 170 vertebrates and vectors. With A.J. Duggan he prepared a Catalogue of the Garnham Collection of Malaria Parasites and other Haemosporidia (30), and deposited the collection in the Wellcome Museum; it was later moved to the Natural History Museum, London. Cyril not only described new species of parasites he encountered, but also turned his attention to systematics, particularly of malaria parasites. With Aldo Corradetti and Marshall Laird (10), he revised the higher taxa of Plasmodium of avian hosts classifying them in new subgenera and insisting on the retention of the generic name Plasmodium for the true malaria parasites of birds and, later (12, 18), he similarly revised the subgeneric classification of the mammalian malaria parasites. In the latter revision, he set up the subgenus Vinckeia to accommodate Plasmodium species of mammals other than primates of higher rank than lemurs. When one of us (R.K.-K.) attacked the features said to distinguish this taxon, Garnham's tolerance of criticism was well illustrated. With tongue in cheek, he wrote that his student had had the impertinence to suggest that Vinckeia was poorly defined. In appreciation and respect, Cyril's students and colleagues named the following taxa in his honour. 187</page><page sequence="17">Biographical Memoirs PROTOZOA Family Garniidae Lainson, Landau &amp; Shaw, 1971 Genera Garnia Lainson, Landau &amp; Shaw, 1971 Cyrilia Lainson, 1981 Garnhamella coturnixae Sarkar &amp; Ray, 1961 Species Plasmodium garnhami Guidy, Hoogstraal &amp; Mohamed, 1965 Plasmodium percygarnhami Landau et al., 1989 Anthemosoma garnhami Landau, Boulard &amp; Houin, 1969 Hepatocystis garnhami Landau, 1981 Babesia garnhami Heisch, 1954 Isospora garnhami Bray, 1954 Eimeria garnhami McMillan, 1958 Hoarella garnhami Arcay de Peraza, 1963 Sarcocystis garnhami Mandour, 1965 Cryptosporidium garnhami Bird, 1981 Lankesterella garnhami Lainson, 1959 Gregarina garnhami Canning, 1956 Leishmania garnhami Scorza et al., 1979 NEMATOCERA Anopheles (Cellia) garnhami Edwards, 1930 Anopheles (Cellia) ribulorum garnhamellus Evans &amp; Leeson, 1937 Uranotaenia garnhami Van Someren, 1948 Sergentomyia garnhami Heisch et al., 1956 ACARIDAE Subgenus Garnhamphysalis Hoogstraal &amp; Wassef, 1981 PERSONALITY To foreigners, Cyril Garnham was an archetypal Englishman, considerate, well-mannered, courteous and apparently always in control. He was an ardent internationalist and, although basically shy, he had a wide circle of friends all over the world with whom he kept in touch by correspondence, usually by almost illegible hand-written letters. His high-pitched voice was his most striking physical characteristic, and he was affectionately imitated by his staff and students, sometimes with such accuracy that recipients of telephone calls were completely deceived into thinking they were talking to Cyril himself. Although his voice carried well, he felt that he had no natural theatrical talent and was not at ease lecturing without careful preparation and detailed notes. Garnham was a natural leader and was notable for the magical way in which he could enthuse his assistants so that they would cheerfully work all night when necessary. He never needed to give an instruction, a mere suggestion was enough. He was skilled at recognizing the potential of young workers and then to setting them apparently impossible tasks which, when successfully accomplished, gave an extraordinary boost of confidence. Thus, Ian Keymer was dispatched to Central Africa to trap duiker and remove their spleens in the hope 188</page><page sequence="18">Percy Cyril Claude Garnham of bringing about relapses of a poorly known malaria parasite, P. cephalophi, and another related species. The latter was discovered by Sir David Bruce, F.R.S., in Nyasaland before the First World War and excited Cyril's attention when he saw the beautiful watercolour illustrations by Sir David's constant companion, Lady Bruce, in the archives of the Royal Society. Since its discovery, it had rarely been seen and had never been named. Needless to say, Keymer rediscovered the parasite and Garnham (14) described it fully and named it Plasmodium brucei. This illustrates Cyril's extraordinary determination, which infected his students. He refused to recognize any difficulty that might imperil his objectives and nothing stood in his way, especially interference from bureaucrats who, he believed, had nothing better to do than impede his progress. He had a cavalier attitude to regulations and once told his student Alistair Voller, 'rules are for fools'. Garnham attracted students from all over the world but he only occasionally involved himself in getting support for them, and had a simple way of choosing the best. A student who asked for a Ph.D. project would seldom be accepted: the ones he preferred already had some ideas of their own. Cyril believed that students should not be dominated by their Professor, thus stimulating independent thought, which made them self-reliant. Like his old mentor, Emile Brumpt, Garnham declined coauthorship on publications from the theses of his students who would, therefore, build a reputation independently from that of their teacher. Garnham's interests extended far beyond parasitology, which he once said was not his real passion in life. It was music. He particularly loved the operas of Wagner and, at the age of 75, he wrote an emotional appreciation of the Ring (22), which, from 1922, he saw every year whenever he had the opportunity. He bought a bust of Wagner and had it mounted on a pillar in a wooded part of his garden but, by the time he had reached his 80s, it had suffered severely from the weather and he went to great lengths to replace it. Finally, he installed a new one made specially for him by the sculptress daughter of his Belgian friend, Professor J. Jadin. Cyril was one of the dying breed of medical men steeped in natural history. His intense curiosity and aesthetic appreciation of living creatures fitted him well for studies on parasites with their extraordinary life cycles and beautiful structures. He transmitted this enthusiasm to a generation of students from all comers of the world and truly established a school in his subject which is his permanent memorial (figure 1).
