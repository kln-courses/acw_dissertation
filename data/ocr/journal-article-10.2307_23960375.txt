<plain_text><page sequence="1">LAST CONVERSATIONS WITH ALFRED LOISY I IN my Sarum Lectures at Oxford1 I recalled that John Collins and I had visited Alfred Loisy at Ceffonds for two days in 1938, but that to my vexation I had mislaid the record which I had made at the time of our conversations with him. I have since found it and it is of more interest than I had supposed. We had four long conversations with Loisy and they were probably among his last conversations of this kind, for he died in June 1940. His journal for 30 March 1938 contains this entry: 'Visite de mes amis Anglais a ioh. et a 3I1. lis m'ont pose d'interes santes questions. lis doivent revenir ce matin ioh. et repartiront pour l'Angleterre au commencement de l'apres-midi. Les reverrai-je encore, c'est bien douteux.'2 The following is a transcript of the record that I made, to which I have now added some annotations. In answer to questions that I asked him he said that at the time of L'fivangileL'fivangile et I'Uglise Wilfrid Ward had not yet 'taken his line'. He (Loisy) has not reviewed nor publicly commented on Lacger's biography of Mgr Mignot.3 Lacger is one of the group with Riviere, etc. who took Batiffol as their hero. Von Hugel's article on Mignot in the Contemporary Review*Review* was prepared in conjunction with Lacger. Loisy sent Lacger a copy of a letter to him from Mignot for which Lacger asked; but Lacger published only misleading excerpts from this which gave a false impres sion of its contents. Lacger, etc. maintain that Mignot did not under stand L'Evangile et I'Eglise, but that is very unjust to Mignot, who incidentally was of an esprit plus large and more tolerant than von Hiigel. If Loisy published the full versions of the letters he received from Mignot and Bremond5 they would prove more compromising for both than the passages which he has published. In writing his MemoiresMemoires he did not feel justified in publishing more than the passages from Mignot's letters which were directly relevant to the modernist movement. 1 See A Variety of Catholic Modernists (Cambridge, 1970), pp. 9 f. 2 B.N., n.a. f. 15664. 3 Louis de Lacger, Monseigneur Mignot (Paris, 1933). 4 May 1918. 5 Mignot's letters to Loisy (120 of them) may now be seen in the Bibliotheque Nationale, n.a. f. 15659. Bremond's letters to Loisy were published in the Bulletin Bulletin de Litterature Ecclesiastique (Toulouse) in 1968-9: lxix, pp. 1-24, 161 84, 269-89; lxx, pp. 44-56.

One of Houtin's libels was that Loisy had in his rooms pictures of Newman, Fenelon, etc. in order to suggest that he was himself one of these 'grands esprits', but the fact is that these pictures were given to him—■ that of Newman by Thureau-Dangin. It is a large one which now hangs in his study in front of his writing-desk. Houtin's mind, he thinks, was deranged in his last years. Tout Tout le monde knew that Lagrange had a commentary on Genesis prepared for publication which, because of the critical indiscretions it contained, had to be suppressed after the condemnation of modernism. He withdrew from circulation his book on criticism and the Old Testament. Whether the commentary on Genesis is still among his papers or has been destroyed one cannot say. Loisy is sure that von Hiigel made some private act of submission to the anti-modernist oath. He admitted that after Loisy's excommuni cation von Hugel modified his attitude: he always continued to go far in his biblical criticism, but for the rest he entrenched himself more and more in his own particular form of mysticism, and he was (unlike Mgr Mignot) 'un esprit tres systematique et dogmatique'. As regards Le Roy,2 Loisy said that Baudrillart was probably responsible for denouncing him to the Holy See; but (I understood him to say) Cardinal Verdier was a rarity, i.e. an Archbishop of Paris who was capable of understanding Le Roy's position. Verdier arranged an acceptable formula which prevented Le Roy's excommunication—the extent of his condemnation was that his name was no longer included in the list of Catholic savants in the Catholic Almanach. Le Roy is the father of a large family, who attend Saint Sulpice, of which Verdier was Superior. Verdier would never have been appointed Archbishop in M. Icard's time: for M. Icard would have said: 'The business of our society is unobtrusively to assist in the training of the clergy of France for the sake of Our Lord—not to provide Archbishops.' Verdier's promotion may have been in reparation for the condemnation of the Manuel biblique used by Saint Sulpice. Cardinal Bourne among others had protested (discreetly) to Rome against this condemnation. Le Roy had become Bergson's successor at the College de France. Bergson had 1 In the event it was published: see Alfred Loisy, sa vie, son ceuvre by Albert Houtin and Felix Sartiaux, edited by fimile Poulat (Paris, i960). This volume also contains an 'index bio-bibliographique' concerning other personalities who were mentioned in my conversations with Loisy. 2 Edouard Le Roy (1870-1954): see A Variety of Catholic Modernists, pp. 90-3·</page><page sequence="3">86 A. R. VIDLER asked Loisy to propose Le Roy's candidature, but Loisy had replied that to do so could compromise Le Roy. He had, however, assured the head of the College de France that Le Roy had a way of combining his faith with his philosophical liberty so that the former did not at all interfere with the latter. Le Roy had been proposed for the Academie Franfaise, but Loisy did not think he was an assez grand ecrivain for that.1 Duchesne had an extraordinary memory, and kept no papers or memos as he could retain everything that he wanted in his head. He had a real piety like his fellow countryman Chateaubriand (though not the same morals!) but un esprit tres libre. It is uncertain whether Bremond had written the final volume of his HistoireHistoire du sentiment religieux—the crucial volume in which he would have argued that the mysticism of Fenelon was le mat mysticisme. If it was written, attempts may be being made to prevent its publication. Speaking of contemporary politics, Loisy said that he was thankful not to be the confessor of politicians; it was an essentially demoralizing profession. The democratic powers he would describe now as lesgrandes impuissances.impuissances. The League of Nations was a well-conceived project, but the statesmen who launched it were only 'humanitaires' and did not know the vital importance of religion: that was a general defect in idealistic politicians. The Church has a tremendous opportunity to witness to the necessity of the spiritual life—but it was mixed up now in political affairs and considerations. In recent centuries the popes had been diplomats rather than religious leaders. Speaking about the present state of the Church in France, Loisy said Gallicanism was completely dead. There is an understanding now between the Vatican and the French government by which the former will not appoint bishops to French sees without having first consulted the government. Since the revision of the Canon Law in 1917, the pope has a 'say' in everything—even in the appointment of a sacristan for Ceffonds! The cure of Montier-en-Der2 is 'peu instruit et reactionnaire'. Fifty years ago a peasant said to Loisy that he no longer went to church because he could no longer join in the singing—this was an illustration of the way in which the imposition of the ultramontane usages had been contrary to the interests of religion. Recently when a preacher in Notre Dame de Paris was putting across some ideas which smacked of Laberthonniere—moral dogmatisme— which were much relished by the hearers—the Holy See intervened and got him stopped. 1 He was in fact elected a member in 1945. 2 The parish which adjoins Ceffonds.</page><page sequence="4">LAST CONVERSATIONS WITH ALFRED LOISY 87 Question by A. R. V.: '11 y a maintenant des critiques bibliques anglais qui, tout en admettant le caractere eschatologique de l'evangile primitif de Jesus, disent que c'est une eschatologie realisee, qu'en effet Jesus a dit que le Regne de Dieu est venu, plus que le Regne de Dieu viendra. Moi-meme je pense que le Regne de Dieu annonce par Jesus est futur, pas du tout deja arrive. Qu'en pensez-vous ?' Loisy said that in the Gospels, as we have them, the ideas that the kingdom is future and that it is come are both there; but they are inconsistent, and the former is surely original, the latter being subse quent interpretation. The first disciples preached the future coming of the kingdom; the earliest prayer of the Christians was Maran-atha. Question by A. R. V.: 'Le chef des protestants liberaux anglais, le docteur Major, a dit recemment qu'il est sur que Joseph etait le pere de Jesus. Je pense que nous n'avons pas dans le nouveau testament de renseignements historiques suffisants pour justifier une opinion sure sur cette question-la. N'est-ce pas ?' Loisy answered that the question whether Joseph was the father of Jesus belongs to that class of question which we cannot answer because there are no reliable historical data available for the purpose. Question by A. R. V.: 'Vous avez dit dans Autour d'un petit livre — n'est-ce pas ? — que Jesus dans l'humilite de son service est assez grand pour justifier la christologie, et que la christologie n'a pas besoin d'etre enseignee par Jesus pour etre vraie. Direz-vous aujourd'hui la meme chose ? Loisy would still say—avec commentaire—what he said in Autour d'un petit petit livre. The truth about Christian origins and the movement initiated by Christ is greater and not less than what the authors of the christo logical dogmas tried to express in the terms of thought which were at their disposal. Lagrange has recently died: Loisy had in his new book a footnote in which he was 'getting at' Lagrange and Lepin. But he was able to get Lagrange's name omitted in time. He said Lagrange was 'un grand erudit, mais pas un grand savant ni un grand ecrivain'—■just as someone said of Bossuet that he was 'un grand genie mais pas tres intelligent'. We were told in our hotel that the practising Catholics in the neigh bourhood [i.e. of Ceffonds] would have nothing to do with Loisy, but by the rest he is greatly respected. A Catholic barber who used to go to him professionally was prohibited from doing so by the cure. Loisy said that if he had not been chased out of the Church he would have been able to accommodate himself inside until his dying day. As regards religious cultus, etc., everyone ought to utilize the apparatus which he inherits, the milieu, etc. Certainly the liturgy must</page><page sequence="5">88 A. R. VIDLER conceive of God in personal terms, and while the critical theologian may for himself be aware of the limitations of anthropomorphism, yet he must recognize that the progress of religion is a very slow process to be pursued with care and discretion. He agreed that it had been his misfortune to be born in a country where the Roman Church with its theological absolutism provided the only actual religious milieu. Our position in the Church of England is different and offers much greater opportunities. Question by A. R. V.: 'Est-ce que Laberthonniere a partage vos idees sur la critique biblique comme von Htigel, ou est-ce que Laber thonniere n'etait pas un esprit ouvert en ces matieres mais qu'il etait moderniste seulement en matiere de la philosophie ?' Laberthonniere was an esprit plus large que Blondel,1 but he was not auau courant de la critique biblique. Blondel was a typical philosophical systematizer—and had learned nothing fresh since the publication of L'Action.L'Action.L'Action. Laberthonniere was much more ready to learn and take in new ideas. Le Roy was also a philosopher with a system of his own, but his system allowed of an extremely liberal attitude to dogma. Turmel2 is now old and ill and his mind somewhat affected. He is a born fanatic. He was born in very poor circumstances—his father a seller of faggots on the Faubourgs and Turmel as a boy assisted him. Then a 'saint pretre' found Turmel one day in a church in an ecstasy in front of a crucifix—took him up and forwarded his education. He became an 'esprit tres scholastique' and remained so even after he turned against the Church: i.e. he was as systematic in negation as in affirmation. He justified his disavowal of the authorship of the articles by Dupin and Herzog (which he had in fact written) on the ground that the Church had taught him to lie. After his excommunication and degradation he continued (until quite recently) to minister to some of his former paroissiens, pious poor simple folk who were much attached to him—and gave them the last sacraments, etc. The Archbishop of Rennes, who was fully aware of Turmel's proceedings (pseudonymous publications), reckoned that the scandal of his exposure would have been greater than connivance, and so took no action. So nothing was done until Turmel was denounced to Rome. Turmel has recently pub lished a book of memoirs, but they are not too reliable as they are not based on documents. Loisy said that if he himself does not speak a great deal about 1 For Laberthonniere and Blondel, see A Variety of Catholic Modernists, pp. 78-90. 2 On Joseph Turmel (1859-1943), see ibid., pp. 56-62.</page><page sequence="6">LAST CONVERSATIONS WITH ALFRED LOISY 89 'Dieu' it is because it is a word with compromising associations, e.g. Lourdes and Lisieux. Loisy said that Pere Hyacinthe1 made a mistake in starting his attempt at Catholic reform with the question of clerical celibacy— which in the given conditions of the Roman Church needs treating with great prudence. No doubt there is need for reform here—in Spain, South America, and Mexico concubinage is widespread among the priests. Loisy has seen a document which showed that a lot of priests organized a strike because a bishop proposed to deprive them of their gouvernantes. A. R. Vidler A. R. V1DLER 1 See A.
