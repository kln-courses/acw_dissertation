<plain_text><page sequence="1">New dimensions in basal readers ALBERT J. HARRIS Well known as an author, Albert Harris is professor emeritus, City University of New York. This review of recent trends in basal readers was first offered as a presentation at the 1971 IRA convention in Atlantic City. ASI began to think about this **** topic, the first question that occurred to me was: what does "new" mean? A dictionary dis closed several possible meanings: of recent origin; not yet used; un familiar; begun afresh, as in a cyclical repetition; changed for the better; different from what was before; and, recent and fashion able. Two of these seemed to fit together and be appropriate for the task. So for this paper "new" means that something is recent and different from what was be fore. New does not necessarily mean better, nor fashionable, nor not yet used. And the focus of this paper is on the present and recent past, not on forecasting the future. The term "dimension" in the title is interpreted to mean an aspect or attribute or character istic. The third term, "basal readers," is taken to mean an interrelated set of materials for teaching fun damental reading skills. At a mini mum, such a set requires a sequence of reading materials for the learners, graded in difficulty, and guides or manuals that pro vide directions on how to teach with these materials. Many differ ent kinds of supplements and ac cessories to this basic minimum are available. Objectives The objectives which have guid ed the development of most basal reader series have not changed much since the Report of the Na tional Committee on Reading pub lished in 1925, and elaborated in Reading in the Elementary School published in 1949. Both of these 310 The Reading Teacher January 1972</page><page sequence="2">influential yearbooks called for a balanced and comprehensive set of objectives, in which silent and oral reading, mechanics and comprehension, study skills and recreational reading, group and individual needs, were to be given balanced attention. There have been three recent trends in regard to reading objec tives. The first is the insistence of some writers that, in the early stages of reading instruction, de coding should be stressed and comprehension should be soft-ped aled. This point of view is not new, but has received recent sup port from some linguists and from Chall's Learning to Read: The Great Debate (1967). A second trend in objectives is increased attention to critical read ing and to the development of creative thinking through reading. A third trend is toward the re formulation of objectives into be havioral terms. A behaviorally stated objective specifies the par ticular behavior that a pupil has to display in order to show mastery of it. The emphasis is on what the pupil does, not on his mental proc esses, nor on what the teacher does to elicit this behavior. An older statement of an objec tive as : "to arrange ideas in proper sequence" can be restated behav iorally as follows : "Given a reading selection and a list of statements relating to its content, the stu dent will place these statements in order of their occurrence in the selection." (Reading, 4-6, p. 23) The behavioral statement specifies a way of testing for mastery of the objective. Space does not permit me to discuss in detail the merits and limitations of behaviorally stated objectives, but an opposition to their use is beginning to be heard, as in the recent paper by MacDonald and Wolf son (1970). Vocabulary control From the 1920's into the 1950's, publishers vied with each other in reducing the number of words in troduced in a basal reading series. The bottom was reached when one series taught fewer than 1200 dif ferent words in its readers for the primary grades. Olson's study showed that in the early 1960's new words totalled fifty-four to eighty-three at preprimer level in widely used series; 113 to 173 at primer level; and 285 to 340 at first reader level. Since then the trend has been toward richer vo cabularies. In recent basal reader series, vocabulary is controlled in one of two ways. In readers with a pho nic, linguistic, or phonic/linguis tic approach, the tendency is to teach words that have in common a particular phoneme-grapheme correspondence in a group, and to restrict vocabulary to words which fit into the patterns that have been covered. Exceptions to the patterns are usually taught later. The resulting sentences at beginning level seem very artificial and con trived. In eclectic basal readers words are introduced gradually in a se quence governed by the story to be told, and usually phonic and struc tural generalizations are intro duced in a sequence that is based on the word stock already avail able. The limitations of children's knowledge of word meanings requires some continuation of vo cabulary control after word identi fication skills have been covered, but this tends to be observed more strictly in eclectic readers than in phonic or linguistic readers. Basal readers using a revised orthog raphy, such as i.t.a., are usually phonic or linguistic in their ap proach to vocabulary control. HARRIS: New dimensions 311</page><page sequence="3">How skills are taught There is quite wide variation in methods of teaching word identi fication skills. Among recently pub lished basal reader series two use a modified linguistic approach, one employs a rich vocabulary but re lies heavily on learning the words in context, and two introduce and apply phoneme-grapheme general izations as new words are intro duced. Eclectic basal readers have begun to use linguists and psycho linguists as consultants and to pay attention to their recommenda tions about the ways in which skills should be taught. Most lin guistic and phonic series empha size spelling patterns, which used to be called word families, but there is wide variation in the teaching of phonic generalizations. A small minority uses a synthetic phonics approach in which sound ing and blending are emphasized. In regard to comprehension skills, there has been a recent tendency to place less emphasis on literal comprehension and more on interpretation, inference, criti cal reading, and creative reading. Somewhat greater emphasis tends to be given to study skills. Rate and flexibility are still given little attention in most basal reader programs. Content There are three main trends in regard to content. The first has been a change with regard to characters and their environments. The animals and folk and fairy tales remain, but there has been a recent rather general effort to replace the middle class white stereotype with ethnic and envir onmental pluralism. One finds more emphasis on urban settings, on members of minority groups, and on problems related to limited income. A second trend has been the disappearance of the one-family cast of first grade characters from some recent series. Other series start with one family, but drop it earlier than formerly. In some series, anthropomorphic animal characters replace human charac ters in stories for beginners. A third recent trend has been an increase in the amount of nonfic tion, particularly for intermediate grades. This makes it possible to teach basic study skills with more appropriate content. The practice of placing fiction and nonfiction in separate books has been tried, but does not seem to be becoming a trend. Provisions for skills practice The traditional medium for skills practice has been a work book to accompany each reader in a basal series. These correlated workbooks have not changed much in recent years. One series reduces the amount of teacher assistance needed by providing self-help cues at the top of each page. Self-help is also provided in some series by providing small picture dictionar ies and glossaries in the readers, as low as preprimer level. Many publishers provide exercises in the form of pads of stencils that can be used on duplicating machines. Filmstrips and transparencies can be used to project skills exercises for group use. A beginning has been made in supplying recordings which give directions for exercises and then provide answers for self correction. Although two quite similar series of programed booklets that combine the functions of reader and workbook appeared early in the 1960's, a trend toward greater 312 The Reading Teacher January 1972</page><page sequence="4">use of programed material does not seem to have been established. The computer techniques needed to teach beginning reading by computer-assisted instruction were worked out several years ago. Computer-assisted reading instruc tion remains at the level of ex perimental exploration, and is likely to remain so until two con ditions can be satisfied : 1 ) the cost brought down to a competi tive level; and 2) the software or teaching content developed to a satisfactory level in quantity and quality. There seems more promise at present in the use of computers to give and score tests as an aid in individualizing instruction, provid ing diagnostic information to the teacher, as in what is called "in dividually prescribed instruction." Enrichment The teachers' guides for basal readers customarily provide sug gestions to teachers about stories, books, poetry and music that are related to the reader content and may be used for enrichment. The new trend is to provide these ma terials in convenient packages as optional supplements to the pro gram. These supplements may in clude such items as paperback books for use as independent sup plementary reading, recordings of the supplementary books to allow children to listen to the story while looking at the print, a book con taining stories for the teacher to read to the children, and boxes of games and puzzles that reinforce skills taught in the program. Visual, audio, and kinesthetie accessories As has been mentioned earlier, filmstrips and transparencies have been used as optional supplements in the skills development pro gram. Certain types of recorded materials have also been men tioned, including recorded story books, and recorded directions and scoring for practice exercises. Cas sette tapes seem to be gaining over phonograph records. The main drawback to the expanded use of recorded accessories has been the rather high unit cost of the re cordings. Combinations of visual display units with recordings have been developed outside of basal reading programs but have not been util ized to any extent as basal reader accessories. One form of audio visual material is a combination of filmstrip and recording. This has been available for many trade books for some time. Another form of audiovisual presentation is pro vided by the Bell &amp; Howell Lan guage Master and similar ma chines. These use large cards with a strip of recording tape on each. When the child places the card in the machine he can hear the word spoken as he looks at its printed form. This technique, already well established in remedial work, does not seem to have been used yet as a basal reader accessory. Three-dimensional materials, the shapes of which can be felt as well as seen, were used as an ac cessory reading readiness device in one series about a decade ago. After being ignored by other pub lishers for many years, this idea seems to be reappearing. A recent form of kinesthetic reinforcement uses stencils which guide the trac ing and coloring of alphabet let ters. Tracing and writing are also more often used in recent first grade workbooks than formerly. Format The basic format pattern set by HARRIS: New dimensions 313</page><page sequence="5">the McGuffey Readers over a cen tury ago has lasted to the present. This pattern provided a graded series of books, hardcovered and illustrated, one for each grade of the elementary school. Of course, the series gradually became more elaborate. The first grade program evolved into one or more readiness books, preprimers, a primer, and a first reader. Two hardcovered books became customary for the second and third grades. Often the series stopped at sixth grade. During the past decade a num ber of departures from this tradi tional format have been tried, and at this point it is not easy to dis cern a definite trend. The powerful influence of the paperback has finally caught up with basal readers, with one very recent series offering schools a choice between a conventional hardcovered reader, and the same content bound in units with paper covers. It is too early to discern whether or not this will become a trend. Print size has remained fairly constant for many years. There is an increasing use of sans serif type which resembles manuscript writing, in the first grade and sometimes higher. This has a cer tain logic to it, as it reduces the number of different letter forms the beginning reader has to learn. In the intermediate grades, the use of two column pages has be come common. Illustrations have continued to be used lavishly, especially in pri mary grade readers. Basal reader art shows great variety. Realistic pictures, photographs, diagrams, maps, and charts may accompany factual selections, while the art ac companying fiction ranges from realistic through a simplified car toon style to the distorted and ab stract. Art tends to run to the edge of the page and indefinite bound aries are common. Vivid colors characterize the book covers and illustrations. The influence of the nongraded school has recently been noted in the ways in which basal readers are labeled. Traditionally each reader has been marked with the grade, or part of a grade, at which it was normally expected to be used. The recent trend is to num ber the books in sequence by levels, encouraging teachers and pupils to get away from the idea that a particular book should necessari ly be read in a particular year of schooling. Summary While a number of innovations in basal readers have appeared in the past decade, relatively few of them have become widely adopted. In regard to objectives, there has been an increased emphasis on decoding in beginning reading, a shift from emphasis on literal comprehension toward critical and creative reading, and a very recent interest in behaviorally stated objectives. In vocabulary control recent series employ richer vocabu laries, although most retain some restriction on new words through the sixth grade. There is quite wide variation in the procedures used in teaching word identifica tion skills, while critical and in terpretive reading and study skills receive increased attention. Content shows a trend toward a multiethnic, multicultural scope. The one-family cast of characters in material for beginners is re tained in some recent series but dropped in others. More nonfiction is used, especially in the interme diate grades. Skills practice is pro vided in several additions to, or alternatives for, the traditional 314 The Reading Teacher January 1972</page><page sequence="6">workbook. Pads of stencils for use on duplicating machines, trans parencies and films trips, and re corded directions and scoring are among the recent additions. Pro gramed combination text-work books exist but most basal readers do not provide programed skills practice. Computer-assisted in struction has as yet not influenced basal reader methodology. The recent trend in enrichment is to provide in convenient pack ages the kinds of enrichment ma terials formerly just mentioned in the teachers' guides. Visual and audio supplements exist, but com bined audiovisual accessories are not available for most basal series. Kinesthetic procedures such as feeling, tracing, and writing are given increased emphasis at readi ness and beginning levels. In for mat, new trends include use of paperback units, type which re sembles manuscript writing at early levels, and two column pages at upper levels. Illustrations have become more varied in style, and readers tend to be numbered con secutively by levels rather than identified with specific grades. References Chali, Jeanne.
