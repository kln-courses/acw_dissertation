In the face of Freud's radical critique of all religious and cultural manifestations, Anthony J. De Luca chooses not to defend the integrity of religion by rejecting the mechanistic and reductionistic foundation of Freud's analysis, nor to accede totally to Freud's suggestion that religion yield to the rule of science and reason. In Freud and Future Religious Experience De Luca pursues a more challenging path: he accepts the validity of the psychoanalytic method and its account of religion and then employs that account as the basis for a deeper appreciation of religious symbolism and for the possibility of faith which has been purified of anthropomorphism. De Luca's thesis is that Freud's genetic explanation of religion as a manifesta- tion of infantile wishes and conflicts is accurate but incomplete. Freud's critique concerns only the illusory aspects of religion which are based primarily on the child's fears and wishes in relation to his father. De Luca welcomes the demise of this dimension of religion, for it is a liberation from error. In addition to this genetic or reductive analysis, however, there is a "teleological" dimension to Freud's work which, for De Luca, has religious implications of an altogether different kind. De Luca suggests that the goal of psychoanalysis is to enable people to en- counter reality the way it "really" is rather than in a form distorted by primitive wishes. Psychoanalysis has demonstrated an evolutionary movement toward in- creased acceptance of reality within both the development of the individual and the development of the species. The sublimation of impulses, the subordination of the pleasure principle to the reality principle, the emergence of scientific rationality out of primitive superstition are all part of a teleological process which reveals mankind's continuing struggle to comprehend reality. De Luca offers a theological interpretation of this evolution in human consciousness. If reality or the world is understood as the manifestation of the "Wholly Other" or transcen- dent God, then any evolution in our relation to reality constitutes an evolution in our consciousness of God, the Being who is the source of all reality and meaning. Ironically, the movement away from traditional religion toward a scientific view of reality brings us closer to God. A less distorted view of reality permits a less distorted view of God. The target of Freud's reductive analysis of religion is only the traditional paternal God of accusation and consolation. In short, the psychoanalytic critique of religion can be seen as a negative theology, an iconoclastic effort to purify faith of its infantile idols. De Luca believes that Freud's atheism still leaves open the possibility of the existence of a "Wholly Other" who is revealed to those who leave behind anthropomorphic religion. By eliminating distorted views of reality, psychoanalysis prepares for genuine faith in a postreligious age. The central part of the book includes an examination of various forms of religious symptoms or neuroses which are found in Freud's case studies. Although all of them are rooted in oedipal conflict at some level, the different Permission to reprint a book review printed in this section may be obtained only from the author. 357</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion types of religious symptoms correspond to the various stages of psychological development. As religious symptoms become less regressive there is a greater awareness of the nature of reality. When oedipal conflicts are perfectly sub- limated, as in the case of Leonardo da Vinci, dogmatic religious beliefs do not develop and the way is cleared for a fuller grasping of reality as a manifestation of the "Wholly Other." De Luca is an enthusiastic defender of the scientific validity of Freud's work, and he examines Freud's methods and conclusions from the perspective of"phi- losophy of science." Responding briefly to a variety of criticisms against Freud, he concludes that "Freud, for the most part, conforms in his methodology to the norms set down by philosophy of science" (p. 118). In other words, Freud's concepts and theories are valid because they are grounded in observable facts and meet the scientific requirements of verifiability and falsifiability. Despite some reservations about Freud's methodology in the speculative works on cul- ture and the analyses of absent people, De Luca finds Freud's case studies scien- tifically sound and accurate in tracing religion to oedipal conflict. This aspect of De Luca's argument, however, is not at all satisfying. His appreciation of the serious epistemological questions which a rigorous philosophy of science raises for psychoanalysis is seriously deficient. In fact, few philosophers of science believe that psychoanalytic methods, concepts, and hypotheses can satisfy the most basic elements of scientific theory. It is ironic that De Luca should defend Freud on the issue of science, since his interpretation of Freud has elsewhere been deeply influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur. Indeed, Ricoeur has argued convincingly that psychoanalysis is not a science based on observation, but a hermeneutic science more like history than psychology. As Ricoeur points out, if psychoanalysis is an observational science, the epistemological attack is fatal. This book is of interest because it does provide accurate exposition on all Freud's work relating to religion. The emphasis on religious symptoms in the case studies is particularly valuable. However, the main thesis-that Freud's implicit theology points to the possibility of faith where once stood religion-will be familiar to anyone who has already read Ricoeur's Freud and Philosophy. Un- fortunately, De Luca's version not only lacks the richness of Ricoeur's analysis but also tends to be excessively repetitive. A different problem in the book lies in the implicit theological assumptions which De Luca brings to Freud. His emphasis on faith in the "Wholly Other" who is the source of reality presupposes the perspective of a particular type of existential Protestant theology which stresses God's absolute transcendence. Thus De Luca's conclusions, like Ricoeur's, lean as much on Barth and Bultmann as Freud. This sort of theological reflection on Freud is important, but De Luca gives the misleading impression that Freud himself was quite open to the possi- bility of a transcendent God who is revealed in reality. Although Freud was reluctant to make judgments about the truth value of religious or metaphysical ideas, there is little evidence that he saw the emergence of science and the reality principle as the means for approaching a transcendent God.
