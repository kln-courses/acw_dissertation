<plain_text><page sequence="1">RETREATING STATE AND COMMON MAN* Hoshiar Singh The State is a natural a necessary and a universal institution. It is natural because it is rooted in the realm of human nature. The State is essential for good life - in other words it is the State, which creates the condition to live a happy life. Man needs the State to satisfy his diverse needs. In fact, in the absence of such a controlling and regulating authority ; society cannot be held together and there will be disorder and chaos. The recent origin of terrorism in many countries such as India, Afghanistan, Serbia, Estonia and Israel etc. has necessitated the need of State to protect the life of innocent people. The horror of Sept. ll'h in America has proved that the State is required to control such activities of unsocial elements. Thus State is needed to protect society. At the outset I wish to thank all the members of the Indian Political Science Association for reposing confidence in me by electing President of the association at the 50th National Conference of the Association held at Guntur under the auspices the Department of political science, Nagarjuna University. I am afso thankful tò the Vice-Chancellor of Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut. Prof. Ram Pal Singh for extending an invitation to host the Conference. I also appreciate the leadership qualities of Prof. S.K. Chaturvedi and his team of teachers for making excellent arrangements of boarding and lodging of the participants. Standing in Meerut in the premises of an institution named after a great son of the soil of India. Chaudhury Charan Singh ji, I would like to pay my respects to this great man who all his life strove to serve the common man with all his might including an extra-ordinary commitment to the cause of the peasant community to which I have the honour to belong. Such was Chaudhury sahib's interest in agricultural problems of India that he even gave me, at that time a young scholar, several opportunities to meet him, discussed several aspects of policy and Public Administration and referred me to several leading Political Scientists for further elucidation of these points. It is, indeed, a matter of duty for me to pay my regard to him from this forum and commend all my fellow students of Political Science to pursue Chaudhury sahib's agenda for farmer-friendly public policies. * Presidential Address Delivered on 1 0th Oct., 2003 at the 52nd National Conference of the Indian Political Science Association (IPSA) at Ch. Charan Singh University, Meerut.</page><page sequence="2">The Indian Journal of Political Science 302 Coming to the Presidential Address I have decided to choose a theme that has become important in present context of Liberalization, Privatization and, above all, Globalization which have begun to impact the everyday life of the common man in India who was, heretofore, enjoying the protection of State sustained safety-nets whose continuity and potency are in imminent danger of being shattered. I am sure that there is nobody present in this hall who has not heard of the State being 're-invented, or down-sized, but I wonder how many of the scholars propounding these theses are rooted in the agricultural traditions of the rural communities more specially the poverty under which Indian farmers have begun to re-mould their economic life under the benign umbrella of democracy and welfare State during the last half century or so. Even after 50 years of massive capital formation and emergence of several metropolitan centers, India remains, broadly speaking, a 'rural' State (as per 2001 Census nearly 75% of its electors reside in villages and are responsible for sustaining nearly 35% of its GNP) where the 'common man' is engaged in non-industrial pursuits in small scale communities maintaining a great deal of cultural autonomy but no longer capable of sustaining political and administive self governance on any significant scale. Hence, I invite my audience to take another look at all those theories of State which seek its down-scaling, if not its demise under the guise of reform policies for accelerating the growth-rate of the corporate sector of the Indian economy which is itself not yet mature enough to negotiate all the shocks and pitfalls of a border-less world. Approaches to the Study of the State It is necessary, as Aristotle long ago said, "The State comes into existence originating in the bare needs of life and continuing in existence for the sake of good life". It is a great mistake to oppose people and State, as if the two were always locked in a Manichean zero-sum contest. In fact, a united and homogeneous population is a force for State power, just as the right sort of response from a State can help enable its people. This is all the more so when that people demands increased protection by the State. States are machines for protection.1 In view of its origins and original functions determined long ago, this it is essential to be better informed about the State and its emergent crisis. What is the State, what role it performs for the betterment of the people and society? Who gets what, in the modern State? What</page><page sequence="3">Retreating State and Common Man 303 impact the liberalization has on the working of the State? Why State is retreating from its main responsibilities? How the concept of State is still relevant? What is the position of common man Vis a Vis State? These are some of the important questions, which require detailed analysis. Concept or Definition of State Though the State is a universal institution but no two writers agree on its definition and concept. In an article, "The State" published in the original Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, George Sabine complained a bit about the concept, "The word commonly denotes no class of objects that can be identified exactly, and for the same reason it signifies no list of attributes which bears the sanction of common usage. The word must be defined more or less arbitrarily to meet the exigencies of the system of the jurisprudence or political philosophy in which it occurs2. In the year 1968 in the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences , Fredrick Watkins observed that the complexity of the interaction of Government and people is such that "Political Scientists prefer to use other terms in describing the phenomena that once was subsumed under the concept 'State'3". Watkins accepted that the concept of State and sovereignty were meaningful during the age of Absolutism when people like Louis XIV said, "I am the State". In a democratic society it is, however, hard to distinguish the State from the citizens in whose name its authority is being exercised. Sovereignty thus conceived is little more than a bloodless legal fiction. As we move into the 21st century, attention shifts from the State to the Government, which though it makes no claim to sovereignty, does all the actual ruling4. Watkins further holds that that the distinctive feature of the State, as compared with other associations, is its attempt to monopolize coercive power within its own territory. From the standpoint of a purely descriptive Political Science, Frederick Watkins emphasizes, it is sufficient, therefore to study the conditions that accompany the greater or lesser degrees of monopoly that have been achieved in particular times and places. The difficulty is</page><page sequence="4">The Indian Journal of Political Science 304 that it places excessive emphasis on the coercive aspects of political life5. Hence, as the State concept fell into disuse in mainstream Political Science, it was replaced by such terms as Government, and, later, by political systems. The tendency to abandon the State concept and replace it by other concepts was attributable to the enormous political mobilization that took place in the Western world in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and the proliferation of the new political institutions- political parties pressure groups, the mass media and like that accompanies the concept of the political system if it is included in the conceptual framework for the study of the phenomena of the State6. For the Marxists and neo-Marxists, however, the State continued to be a central concept as an instrumentality through which the capitalist class dominates the social order. Hence, for the Marxists the assimilation of the State into the political system and its dis-aggregation into a host of interacting phenomena in mainstream political science represented a fudging of a reality of a class struggle7. According the Nordlinger, "The definition of the State must refer to individuals rather than to some other kinds of phenomena, such as institutional arrangements "of the legal normative order. Since we are primarily concerned with the making of public policy, a conception of the State that does not have individuals at its core could lead directly into the anthropomorphic and reification fallacies only individuals have preferences and engage in actions that make for their realization and only by making individuals central to the definition can Hegelian implications (substantive and metaphorical) be avoided main referring to the States preferences8. He further said that definition of State should include "all public officials- elective and appointive at high and low levels- who are involved in the making of public policy"9. It should avoid all characterization that may vary from case to case, such as legitimacy and sovereignty. Finally, a definition should seek neutrality. It should avoid attributing specific concerns and purposes to all Sates, such as the preservation of stability or of the reduction of capitalism. Nordlinger offers a fourfold10 classification of State- society relations in terms of high and low State autonomy and social support.</page><page sequence="5">Retreating State and Common Man 305 The Meaning of 6 State9 There have been many different views of nature of the State, therefore, it has become and object of quite conflicting definitions. As seen above, some writers define the State as a class structure while others regard it as the one organization that transcends class and stands for the whole community. Some say it is a power system, others as a welfare system... some view it entirely as a legal construction. Some identify it with the nation, other regards nationality as incidental or unnecessary or even as a falsifying element which inhibits the State in its natural functions. To some it is a necessary evil and to very few an evil that is or will be unnecessary some day. Others think of it as indistinguishable from society itself. Gabriel Almond used the word 'political system' for the State, as the later is limited by legal and institutional meanings11. Thus, every writer has defined it from his own point of view. Out of this maze of confusion we pick up a few definitions, which substantially include the main elements of the Sate. Hall says, "The mark of an independent State are that the community constituting it is permanently established for a political end that it possesses a defined territory and that it is independent of external control". Bluntshli says, "The State is the politically organized people of a definite territory" and, according to Woodrow Willson, "It is the people organized for law within a definite territory". Maclver defines it as, "An association which acting through laws as promulgated by a government endowed to this end with coercive power maintains within a community territorially demarcated the universal external conditions of social order". Harold Laski defines the Sate as "a territorial society divided into government and sú6jects claiming, within its allotted physical area, a supremacy over all other institutions". Gabriel Almond12 says that the political system, the term he used for State, "is that system of interaction to be found in all independent societies, which perform the functions of integration and adaptation" (both externally and vis a vis other societies) by means of the employment, or threat of employment, of more or less legitimate physical compulsions". The political system he explains "is the legitimate</page><page sequence="6">The Indian Journal of Political Science 306 order maintaining or transforming system in the society13". Robert Dahl says, "the political system made up of the residents of the territorial area and government of the area is a 'State' The above definitions contains three main elements: people, territory and government, about the fourth element of sovereignty, there is disagreement; but those who have not clearly mentioned the sovereignty as an element of State attribute a special quality to government; Maclver says it is endowed with coercive powers, it is sovereign says Oppenheimar. The essence of the State, according to Finer is in its monopoly of coercive powers, "this, then, is the State, and its supreme power and monopoly of coercion (which it can devolve in many ways on its own terms) in sovereignty15". Laski says "sovereignty is legally supreme over any individual or group16 and the sovereign possesses supreme coercive power". Taking note of all these points, Garner defines State as a community of persons more or less numerous, permanently occupying a definite portion of territory, independent or nearly so. of external control, and possessing and organized government to which the great body of inhabitants render habitual obedience17". But more recently is focusing literature on the rediscovery of the State because we need some broader notion of 'the State' (or of government) that guides interest intermediation without old authoritarian notion of the State that it has to plan, to control and to implement everything. It is time to glance over the history of the concept of the State, to note reasons for its success and for its decline and to give some thought to present developments in governments, at least to ask if the movement towards diffusion has ceased and whether there are signs of a tendency towards a new concentration. The Origin of the Concept of the State The term State is the product of the sixteenth century and Machiavelli was the first to give it a scientific meaning. He observed, "all the powers which have had and have authority over man are States (State) and are either monarchies or republics18". Writing at the turn of 20th century, Weber con concluded that the State is but one of the forms</page><page sequence="7">Retreating State and Common Man 307 of government that emerged in the sixteenth century. The concept of historical nature of the State developed the thought that State is "the outcome of a single history" which took place in France, Spain and Italy, and also, though only partially in Prussia and Russia. In some other countries (Great Britain and the United States in particular), the organization of the society makes the construction of a State unnecessary. The Centre does not erect itself into a State nor delegate its agents to it. The "Self-Organization of society" is sufficient. This brings us to the question as to what are the functions of the State, a question which is now being answered in negative terms implying that the functions of the State are minimal, if not nil. Functions of the State The State is a term about which every body talks technocrats claims that they can steer it, judges believe that they can discern its interests and politicians that they know how to run it. Liberals have deemed to believe that the State should be an 'Umpire', a 'referee' a regulator and an arbiter- even a 'cash register' of conflicting interests in society. By contrast Marxists, have condemned the State as an instrument of 'executive committee' of a dominant class, Cynical realists have seen the State as an elitist organization of manipulators and/or parasites using 'political formulas' to fool the masses of ordinary citizens19. Some think State is a machine, which energizes whole societies with patriotic or nationalist ideologies. Marxists want to 'smash' the State, or cause it to wither away into a historical memory, but by and large political ťhinkers regard the State as indispensable to complex societies. Those who see the greatest potential for good in the State regard it as a mechanism for realizing 'the common good', 'the public interest' or 'the General Will'. Hegel defended the State as 'the idea made actual' part and parcel of God's journey towards self-realization. Those who are sensitive to the State's capacity for oppression would 'blind', 'tame' and 'control' what Hobbes called Leviathan. According to them constitutional devices should be used to make the State accountable; institutional and social pluralism to divide and fragment its organizations</page><page sequence="8">The Indian Journal of Political Science 308 and capacities; and extensive popular participation in policy formulation and implementation. Still others advocate a minimal State, allowed to intervene only if private markets cannot provide a particular benefit efficiently or in appropriate quantities20. Further, some contemporary ideologies make a sharp distinction between different spheres of State intervention. The first concerns the State's role in providing a legal framework for society, ensuring that law and order prevails, protecting the national territory from external aggression, and upholding certain traditional morale values. The second sphere of State activity concerns intervention in the economic system, to regulate or manage production directly; to remove some or all of the bundle of property rights normally conveyed by private ownership, to redistribute income, and to provide goods and services on a basis distinct from the market principle. "New right' political movements in USA and Western Europe are in favour of more intervention in the first sphere of activity but purpose to 'roll back the State' in the fields of social welfare and economic management. On the other side, democratic socialism adopts a reverse position, favouring the liberalization of moral issues and a lower profile for the State i i the first sphere but an extension of government activities in the second21. Five Images of the State Our main focus is on contemporary theories of the State, which have prompted empirical researchers in Political Science in particular, and social sciences in general. The approaches are: pluralism, the new right, elite theory, Marxism and new-pluralism. Each theory, in contemporary liberal democracies, present different picture of the State. The first image is that of a passive cipher State11, which simply delivers whatever the dominant groups in society demand. The State is a nonentity or a pawn. All five above approaches have their own version of a cipher State image, but they differ about the outside group, which controls government. Pluralists see citizens as in control; the new right find this control defective; elite theorists distinguish a ruling elite and Marxists an economically based ruling class; and neo-pluralists think citizens preferences are followed even though they do not secure direct</page><page sequence="9">Retreating State and Common Man 309 control over decision makers. The second image is that of a partisan State, which primarily preserves the good of State officials while conciliating some other interests. In society whose co-operation is required. Pluralists, consider the partisan State as a broker: for the new right it is a *machine out of control: for the elite theorists it is a dominant State sector elite, and, for the Marxists, it is a specialized apparatus which can act independently when the class struggle is evenly balanced. Only the neo-pluralist approach does not have a clear-cut partisan image of the State. The third image is of a ' guardian ' State , which can reweigh the balance of forces in society according to a longer term or general interest. For the pluralists government prefers substantive social justice and political stability; for the new right it optimizes a restricted conception of the social welfare; in elite theory the State fosters the national interest as defined by dominant groups; for Marxists it advances the needs of all changes within capitalism; and for neo-pluralists State policy follows fragmental image of social needs23. Concept in Crisis The loss of interest, and dearth of theoretical studies on the State, is attributed to various factors: according to some it is a reflection of the loss of the "sense of the State" while others consider it a sign of the general weakening of judicial thinking. The concept of the State does not worked as unifying factor, nor does it now serve the purpose of generating impartial activity on the part of public official. In modern systems, the need for impartiality has become so great that the principle has been developed into a series of rules, including highly detailed ones, as a means to separate private from public interest. Once these rules are developed and consecrated as norms, there is no longer need for the conceptual construction of the learned in developing the concept of State; the theory of State has lost its normative or prescriptive meaning and it cannot even be used as a tool of analysis because government has evolved in other directions, towards diffusion rather than toward concentration. Leon Duguit in France (1970) declared, "The State is dead". Finally, it</page><page sequence="10">The Indian Journal of Political Science 310 is said that, beyond the State and written laws of the State, there are other legal systems so that State is not the sole source of law. Nowadays, the notion that there are multiple legal systems is widespread. This way not the case when everything was referred back to the State. The State has now become fragmented. The various federalisms and régionalisations have loosened the bond between Centre and periphery. The creation of parallel central organizations along with the States, such as public corporations, commissions, legal persons in their own rights like the State, has undermined the central constitution. On account of these parallel institutions today the State is "just a name", it is "an aggregation of organizations". That is why it always requires a qualifying noun or adjective: "welfare State", 'absolute State' representative State, democratic State, parliamentary State, community State, State as government etc. Globalisation and Governance : Is the State Retreating? The concept of governance has also weakened the State. The capacity of natural governments to control courts has been weakened. Governments have learned that they cannot hold back the market. High regulation and high taxation may deter 'inward investment' or lead to flight of capital; socialist and social democratic governments have discovered limits to their capacity to redistribute income and wealth, or improve welfare provision. In so far as governance involves governments doing less; steering rather than rowing, enabling rather than providing, globalization can be held at least partially responsible24. Yet the notion of governance as governing without government is contestable. Moreover, some critics think the whole globalization thesis and the complementary assumptions concerning the importance or decline of the State are, at best, exaggerated. Thus, globalization may be associated with the transformation rather than a decline of the State in the direction of more complex multilevel governance. The other reason of decline of State is "the weathering away of central governments" and mushrooming of religious cleavages, tribalism, violence, volatility and diseases; urban dysfunctions,</page><page sequence="11">Retreating State and Common Man 311 overcrowding, crime, desertification and deforestation, social fault-lines and the non-responsive apparatus of State security forces which all lead to increasingly anarchic conditions aggravated by the scarcity of resources and refugee migrations, the erosion of national States and the empowerment of private armies. Without a comprehensive framework for public functioning State cannot work as an effective institution. Globalization and economic liberalization is also helped in downsizing the State. Economic institutions imply the freedom of individual agents from government control. This syndrome has sometimes been taken as the withdrawal of the State, but the concrete evidence suggests that the State is even more important now than even before. This means that under economic liberalizations, where conceptually the State should have withdrawn this institution is required to make a comeback with even a greater power. This greater power of the State is not as an economic buffer nor as a lawmaker, but as an investor into the social sector, as a promoter of social infrastructure, as a facilitator of the corporate world and as a regulator of investment flowing into the various sectors of the economy. Successful States are the ones, which are facilitators first, and then agents of control, problems begin when States become agents of control rather than facilitators. The other reason for the widespread resentment against State was that as an instrument of control through generalized laws and standardized rules which of often rain contrary to the logic of specific situations, a system developed by which the officials of the State and politicians in power could grant, to the people, concessions and exceptions to the rules. This led to widespread corruption, on one hand, but also to a very different kind of politics. Economic behaviour primarily became rent-seeking and political behaviour reservation seeking, it means that the various interest groups demanded distribution of rights and entitlements on the basis of their membership to one group or the others25. Restoring/Revitalising the State State came into being for good life, therefore, it is a foremost duty of State to protect and safeguard the interest of all groups and</page><page sequence="12">The Indian Journal of Political Science 312 sections of the society. Pendleton Herring in his book Public Administration and the Public Interest questioned how administrative organization in a democracy could resist the onslaught of particularistic groups and its own conservative propensities and contribute to the general welfare. He points out that the democratic State must somehow deal with the conflict between the capital and the labour. It cannot afford to await the survival of the fittest. The exigencies of the age demand positive State activity in order that democracy itself may continue. He further said, " if the existence of the democratic regime rests upon the assumption that the State exists not for the welfare of any one class but for the benefit of the people as a whole, this great growing bureaucracy must be guarded from domination by economic group of social classes26. The modern State is supposed to create equality and fraternity among individuals and also promise the liberty of the individual. The poor people have not been served by their States. In present situation/conditions the gap between the rich and the poor seems doomed to increase faster because of globalization. Globalization at present means great prosperity for the few and continuing inequality and poverty for the many. It is certain that globalization, in its present form, deepens already existing grave inequalities, therefore it is essential to form better ways to distribute its benefits and the State is required to ensure that globalization will be a global blessing, not a cause for the poor. An effective and accountable State is essential for the development of each nation. An excellent State can make a huge difference to the quality of life of the people, especially of poorer countries. The large complex States failed to manage effectively. The power structure of the State displaced the society service agenda by the self-interest agendas of the politicians, administration and businessman. The States generally performs certain general functions such as law and order, justice, enactment of laws, security (internal and external) foreign relations, provision for social services and civic amenities etc., therefore, all States must develop the structures and systems which can perform these functions. States should develop mechanism of control, coordination and accountability for spending</page><page sequence="13">Retreating State and Common Man 313 public fonds. David Osborne and Ted Gaebler in their book, Reinventing Government have pleaded to create an entrepreneurial business like State. The World Bank in its World Development Report 1997 has outlined market-friendly State but both these models have their own shortcomings. The former is meant for capitalist States like America while the later was in the form of conditionally imposed by the World Bank on donor countries so that World Bank's loan's can be returned back. The State should have teeth to bite if something comes in the way of proper functioning of welfare of the common people. The State should develop the capacity and machinery for the greatest good of the greatest number. State and the Common Man in India The State might be in a State of multiple crises in the charmed circles of the academic elite, specially those ensconced in the ivory towers of the Western universities where even the teachers have become a part of the 'jet-set' (or, worse still, have allowed themselves to be embedded in the pro-Globalization marketers), the common man in the Third World still needs the State. In spite of its 'first-world' features like software engineering, satellite manufacturing and on-going transport and communication revolutions, India is still (circa 21st century) a Third World country albeit with a very great difference. The Republic of India has been equipped with a vibrant constitutional democracy in which the common man has a hands-on control on the steering wheels of the State toppling governments in multi-party elections unseating even incumbent Prime Ministers and Chief Ministers. In how many contemporary States "anti-incumbency" has become a prominent factor in shaping and sharing of power? Politics of Re-inventing the State The Republic of India accounts for a meager 2.4 percent of the world surface area of about 136 million sq. km. and sustains as much as 16.7 percent of the world population, but, in addition to this adverse man-land ratio, it also houses the largest number of unemployed youth, handicapped people, beggars, slum dwellers and illiterates, the population</page><page sequence="14">The Indian Journal of Political Science 314 of the illiterates in India being larger than the total population of any country in the world except People 's Republic of China . As high a percent of the total population as 72% is still (cf 2001 census) residing in small villages without safe drinking water, medicines and nutrition; provision of these and other related basic needs is likely to remain high public priority for at least the next 2 to 3 decades provided the runaway growth in population can be checked since every one million increment (during 1991-2001 the increment was as high as 18 million persons) the country would ( vide Professor J.P. Singh of Patna University)27 need 9.6 quintiles of additional food-grains, 9760 new schools, 28690 new teachers, 193000 units of new houses, 3.07 new jobs and 146 lakh meters of extra cloth. The economic needs of the 'common man' in India are very simple and hardly need large-scale imports from metropolitan markets in the West where the standards of material consumption are beyond the imagination of the average Indian agriculturist, more specially so if he happens to be a landless agricultural labourer whose armies have already acquired a strong clout in the southern States and are not too far away from doing the same even in the cow-belt of Uttar-Pradesh! These political realities of universal adult franchise would have to be juxta-posed against the academic crises in which the concept of State has become engulfed in the West where villages have practically ceased to exist physically as well as politically. In India, on the other hand, the villagers and urban slum dwellers constitute a formidable franchise-power whose voice cannot be silenced by intellectual discussions about "re-inventing the State". Obviously, Political Scientists cannot remain oblivious to the global currents "right-sizing" the State; it is, indeed, their duty to read all the new theories and teach them to their students taking even the trouble of translating what they read into the local and regional vocabularies, but is even more important that they question and cross- question all these theories and concepts and evaluate them against the "revolution of the rising expectations" of the "common man" in India without whose active involvement India's much-hyped democracy would collapse sooner rather than later as can be witnessed in a larger swathe of territory under the effective governance of what the Ministry of Home</page><page sequence="15">Retreating State and Common Man 315 calls "Left-wing Extremism", a territory much larger than Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir and North-East combiner. In many parts of India the continuing success of the "Green Revolution" has kept these forces at bay, but the fact that they could mount a physical assault on one of the most vocal spearheads of LPG reforms in India shows the extent of common man's disenchantment with political activists who want to preside over the liquidation of the State. Political Scientists in India would, therefore, do well to read and re-tell the strident pleas for dismantling the State, but they must also read them with Indian eyes keeping their feet firmly planted on India soil, which has sustained not only a sophisticated culture but also a buoyant agriculture.
