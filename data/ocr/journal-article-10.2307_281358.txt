The Wolves of Heaven: Cheyenne Shamanismt, Cere- monies, and Prehistoric Origins. KARL H. SCHLE- SIER, with drawings by WAH-PAH-NAH-YAH (DICK WEST). University of Oklahoma Press, Nor- man, 1987. xviii + 214 pp., illustrations, biblio., index. $25.00 (cloth). Reviewed by Jeffrey R. Hanson, University of Texas- Arlington. In Wolves of Heaven, Karl Schlesier reconstructs the prehistoric origins of the Tsistsista branch of the Chey- enne and places their genesis as a tribal entity in the Northern Plains. Drawing on an eclectic assortment of perspectives and methodologies including cognitive- linguistic, ethnological, and archaeological approaches, Schlesier sets about his task, which is to place Cheyenne antiquity in the Northern Plains beginning about 500- 300 B.C. Focusing on Tsistsista "world description" and the cultural centrality of the Tsistsista Massaum or earth-renewal ceremony, Schlesier's aim is to pro- vide a "reinterpretation of Tsistsistas culture accept- able to the Tsistsistas" (p. xii). The author warns the reader in advance that his interpretation of Tsistsistas culture history "contradicts all the extant literature on the Cheyenne" (p. xi). In the first chapter, Schlesier provides an emic view of Tsistsistas world description and shamanism. Heavily drawing on Tsistsistas cosmologic and cos- mographic classifications, Schlesier uses a cognitive- linguistic perspective to describe Tsistsistas shaman- ism and theories of hunting. In chapters two and three, Schlesier describes the world description of Northern Siberian societies and draws parallels between them and North American Algonkian hunters. For example, parallels are drawn between the role of Siberian shamans in petitioning spirit "game keepers" for animal renewal and the Tsist- sistas Massaum. Based upon comparisons such as these, Schlesier argues for a homologous relationship between Algonkian-speaking peoples (including the Cheyenne) and northern Siberian hunters. Chronologically, proto- Tsistsistas, as a vanguard of southward Algonkian mi- grations from a Taiga Biome, immigrated around 1000 B.C., arriving in the Plains 500 years later (p. 43). The following chapter is devoted to a description of Tsistsistas medicine hunts, spirit-lodge rituals, sweat- lodge ceremonies, and the "contrary" institution. These data are used as evidence for a Tsistsistas entrance into the Northern Plains prior to that of other known Plains tribes. Chapters five and six describe the role of the Mas- saum ceremony in Tsistsistas history and prehistory and its validation of the Black Hills as the Cheyenne's first permanent homeland on the Plains. This chapter is particularly rich in details of this important Chey- enne ceremony. It is through the Massaum camp, with its spatial, cosmological, and astronomical orientations that Schlesier traces ancient Tsistsistas territory, as evi- denced by the Bighorn and the Moose Mountain med- icine wheels (p. 87). Chapter seven, Early Tsistsistas in the Northern Plains, bears the most relevance for archaeologists. Here Schlesier attempts to correlate known linguistic groups with prehistoric archaeological complexes and phases: Aztec-Tanoan (Kiowa) with Pelican Lake; Athabaskan with Avonlea; non-Tsistsistas Algonkians (Suhtai, Arapaho, Atsina) with Laurel; Caddoan with "Valley phase"; and Tsistsistas with Besant (pp. 111-135). It is the association of Besant with Tsistsistas that is crit- ical to Schlesier's assertion that this group was "cre- ated" in North Dakota around 500 B.C. In his final two chapters, Schlesier sets the general features of Algonkian shamanistic world interpretation in the context of prehistoric climate change and tribal migration. Comparing Tsistsistas shamanistic inter- pretation with those of distant Algonkians like the Yu- rok and Mahican, and contrasting the Massaum with the Mandan Okipa ceremony, Schlesier concludes that the Massaum owes more to a homologous Algonkian heritage than to Siouan diffusion. Finally, Schlesier ar- gues not only for the evolutionary success of Algon- kian-Siberian world description, but for the opposition of scientific rationalism and shamanistic world views and the objective superiority of the latter. While sha- manistic world view "allows recognition of the other," rationalist world view is anthropomorphic, mechanis- tic, and ethnocentric (p. 189). Wolves of Heaven is unquestionably a thought-pro- voking book. Its contribution, however, seems to lie not in the archaeological or ethnohistoric implications of Schlesier's interpretations, but rather in the philo- sophical and epistemological problems associated with writing history that will "be acceptable" to particular ethnic or interest groups. Schlesier's disdain for sci- entific rationalism appears evident in his uncritical and often superficial use of archaeological data and eth- nologic method. From a scientific rationalist perspec- tive, Schlesier's book exhibits numerous flaws. His eth- nographic "evidence" is highly selective and bears little or no control. His use of archaeological data lacks both depth and detail and his diffusionary conclusions lack both distributional and chronological controls. His failure to include ethnohistoric and archaeological ma- terials documenting a Cheyenne horticultural episode is a mystery. Archaeologists and ethnohistorians in- terested in a scientific-rationalist contribution to Chey- enne culture history may be disappointed. However, those interested in the philosophy and epistemology of extreme ethnohistoric relativism will find Wolves of Heaven thought provoking. The Archeology of Western Iran: Settlement and Society from Prehistory to the Islamic Conquest. FRANK HOLE, editor. Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, D.C., 1987. 332 pp., figures, ta- bles, references, index. $49.95 (cloth). Reviewed by Allen Zagarell, Western Michigan Uni- versity. This volume is the product of a conference held in 1977 at the School of American Research on Patterns 216 [Vol. 54, No. 1, 1989]</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES of Settlement and Cultural Development in Western Iran. The conference was to assess progress and prob- lems in the ongoing intensive international program of archaeology designed to elucidate the early history of southwest Iran. Shortly thereafter the Iranian Islamic revolution and the Iran-Iraq war brought to a standstill any further archaeological work in the region. There- fore, this long-delayed work has become an important vehicle for the digestion and evaluation of the massive amounts of accumulated data. The aim is to review the state of west Iranian archaeology from its prehis- toric beginnings to the Islamic conquest. Such an undertaking is certainly ambitious given the vast amounts of data and the very different method- ologies employed. The participants set themselves the task of assessing broad geographical regions, primarily utilizing survey data. They were to look at the overall culture history and the processes that underlie that history, dealing with techniques of analysis appropriate to the various regions. Their aim was to achieve con- sensus permitting comparison of the sequences of the various regions. The volume, gains coherence, there- fore, through a regional, survey-based perspective and understanding of process. Moreover, the participating scholars share certain archaeological assumptions; the prevailing model is materialist, with explanation gen- erally sought within the economic arena, although most subscribe to information processing as a social trans- formative factor. Furthermore, all actively were en- gaged in Iranian field projects, specializing in the prob- lems discussed in their chapters. For those with a specialized interest, either in the archaeology or early history of Greater Mesopotamia or with the evaluation of survey techniques and re- gional approaches to history, this volume is recom- mended strongly. It presents a comprehensive settle- ment history of much of southwest Iran. Contributions include a panoramic discussion of the early village pe- riods by Hole, and an important reevaluation of the Susiana Uruk period by Johnson. Wright reflects on highland-lowland interaction during the period of early state formation, making a significant contribution to the question of the relation of state and specialized nomadic pastoralism. The various historic periods are dealt with by the informative contributions of Alden (Proto-Elamite phase), Shacht, Henrickson (Second Millennium), Levine (the Iron Age), and Wenke (the Partho-Sassanian period). The volume is a rich ma- terial source, including 90 figures, largely dedicated to regional site distributions and an extremely rich bib- liography, providing an excellent overview of work car- ried out in western Iran during the last 30 years. Notwithstanding the overall strength of the volume, it suffers from several shortcomings, perhaps unavoid- ably, given its breadth. Allowing modern borders to define the scope of the investigation cuts off the "ar- chaeological cultures" from their interaction zones. A second difficulty is that, despite broad conceptual agreement of the authors, sections of the volume often do not fit well together. The contributions dealing with the various time periods frequently emphasize very different aspects of regional archaeology. For example, some concentrate on developing regional pottery se- quences (Henrickson, Levine), and others on highland- lowland interaction (particularly Hole, Wright, John- son, and Shacht). There are different interpretations of the same data base, limiting continuity of explanation (note Johnson's critique, pp. 285-286). Wenke dedi- cates a considerable portion of his essay to survey tech- niques. All these are interesting contributions, but rep- resent disjunctions in what attempts to be a continuous narrative and, therefore, may present some difficulties for the nonregional expert. Despite these criticisms, this volume is clearly a ma- jor contribution to a continuing attempt at explanation of social change in one of Greater Mesopotamia's im- portant regions. BOOK NOTES Anasazi Ruins of the Southwest in Color. WILLIAM M. FERGUSON and ARTHUR H. ROHN. Uni- versity of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 1987. xiv + 296 pp., illustrations, glossary, biblio., index. $40.00 (cloth); $20.00 (paper). Reviewed by Roger Anyon, Zuni Archaeology Program. Although many volumes have been devoted to the spectacular Anasazi ruins of the Southwest, few are as lavishly illustrated as this. The scope of this volume is wide, encompassing Anasazi remains from about the birth of Christ through contact, and geographically in- cluding the Colorado Plateau and the Rio Grande Val- ley. After a brief introduction to Anasazi archaeology, the major portion of this work concentrates on the pueblos and other standing architecture of the northern San Juan River, especially Mesa Verde, the Kayenta region, and the San Juan Basin, in particular Chaco Canyon. Zuni, the northern Rio Grande and Salinas areas are also discussed but in much less detail. All the photographs were specifically taken for the book and the emphasis on aerial photographs provides unusual views of many ruins with some spectacular shots of sites in their environmental context. While some professionals may dislike the preference for traditional interpretations of Southwest prehistory and find some inconsistencies and inaccuracies irritating, this book has much to offer, not only to professionals but also to the lay audience for which it is primarily intended.
