<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PARADOX OF THE PROMETHEUS VINCTUS THE student of Greek religion has no more difficult problem to face than that of the Prometheus Vinctus. In previous writings I had always evaded it, because I had not found any solution and I hoped that there might be one. Failing to find anything satisfactory myself or in the writings of others, I have spoken of it in the title of this paper as a paradox rather than a problem. And I am only now setting down my thoughts on it in outline, because I do not find that the religious difficulties of that play are appreciated in their full gravity either by the commentators or by the writers on Greek religion. The play is unique among (a) the dramas of the Attic stage, (b) the literature of Greece, (c) the religious literature of the world. The truth of the first two statements can be proved by a rapid glance through the existing and recorded literature of Greece, especially through the products of the Attic drama. In no other play, as far as we know, was a God, the protagonist, present on the stage through the whole action, not even in the AvKoVlpyEla trilogy of Aeschylus, nor in the Bacchae of Euripides; and in no other Greek drama do we find the character of the suffering God. Dionysos in the dramas above mentioned, although attacked, is rather the cause of suffering to others than a sufferer himself. Moreover, Prometheus is a God suffering for his services to man, as a friend of man. And this brings us within range of a deep and possibly pregnant religious idea, unfamiliar to the Greeks. The dying God may be half-shadowed in certain myths, but it is only the God Prometheus who suffers for mankind. His only parallels in the religious world are Christ on the Cross, and the Indian God Siva suffering agony from the Serpent's poison for the welfare of Gods and men.1 And even these two parallels do not preclude one from maintaining that the Aeschylean Prometheus is an unique figure in the religious drama of the world. For Christ and Siva are consoled by the adoration of men and the love of God or the Gods. But Prometheus Vinctus is tormented and hated by the High God, and with one exception despised and insulted by all the Olympians. The commentators on the play, through their lack of familiarity with Greek or Comparative Religion, have failed to appreciate this unique phenomenon at its proper magnitude. And I do not find it dealt with adequately by Mr. Thomson in his recently published edition. Let us briefly consider first the fundamental features of the play so far as they bear on the religious and ethical questions which challenge our solution. Prometheus is presented to us as a God, and his Godhead was 1 Vide Monier-Williams, Dictionary, s.v. Siva. 40</page><page sequence="2">THE PARADOX OF THE PROMETHEUS VINCTUS 41 sufficiently attested by Greek mythology, and specially for the Athenians by the altar which they erected to him in the Akademeia and which was associated with the Lampadephoria.2 Even the Olympians recognise that he is a God; and he himself in this play proclaims and in the next play, the Prometheus Luomenos, deplores his immortality. He belongs to the older Titanic group, most of whom were dispossessed with Kronos, but a few, such as he and his mother ' Ge-Themis,' survived in the later cult. And their survival was accounted for by the myth to which Prometheus makes pathetic reference that they had helped the Olympians in their struggle with the Titans. The Aeschylean Prometheus avers that it was by his advice alone that Zeus and his family won the victory. Therefore the supreme God owed him a deep debt of gratitude. But so far from showing any sense of indebtedness, he inflicts on the Titan an agonising punishment, a torture of the kind that Apollo in the Eumenides specially reprobates,3 something like perpetual crucifixion and impaling. And the sole crime of Prometheus is his beneficent service to mankind, his 'philanthropic habits,' but specially his gift of fire to men. This gift is represented by his enemies as a theft of that which was the rightful prerogative of the Olympians alone, especially of Hephaistos. It is nowhere indeed stated that Zeus had issued a clear mandate that mortals were not to receive fire and that Prometheus had deliberately disobeyed. In our equally crude story of Adam and Eve and the apple there is a primitive principle ofjustice: they knew when eating it they were disobeying a divine mandate, and the early Jewish God was fully as vindictive as Zeus. But there is no hint either on the part of Aeschylus or in Hesiod of any disobedience on the part of Prometheus which might have justified the anger of the despot parvenu 0s vtov Kpar&lt;,. It is merely that Prometheus loved and tried to preserve a race whom Zeus hated; in 11. 234-35 the Titan asserts that as soon as the Olympian dynasty was established, Zeus wished to destroy the whole race of man, who according to Hesiod had led happy and blameless lives under Kronos, and having destroyed them to create a new race of beings, and Prometheus boasts that he alone dared to thwart the designs of Zeus and to save mankind. It is very doubtful if, as is usually supposed, Aeschylus is here referring to Deukalion's deluge and to some casual myth that it was Prometheus who suggested to Deukalion the means of escape in his ark.4 Even if this view is correct, neither in the Greek nor the Biblical version of the deluge-story is the action of the High God given a clear moral significance and purpose.5 So far we discern in the Aeschylean statement of the whole tO0os the predominant influence of Hesiod. The Prometheus-legend is given both in the Theogony and Works and Days; in the latter the only offence men- tioned is the stealing of fire which Zeus had hidden away from mortals in order to make their lot harder. In the former poem an additional offence is narrated in detail, the trick that Prometheus played on Zeus 2 Vide my Cults of the Greek States, v, p. 381, and i, Athena, Ref. 98g-. 3 1. 190o. 4 Apollod. i, 7, 2. 5 Ibid. 3, 8, 2, mentions the view that the flood was caused by the wickedness of Lykaon.</page><page sequence="3">42 L. R. FARNELL in the allocation of the parts of the sacrificial victim; the old Boeotian poet tries to save the omniscience of Zeus by making him choose the worser portion deliberately, in order to have the better excuse for wreaking his spite on mankind; that is, he thinks it more becoming in the High God to be malignant than to be ignorant. The only critic of antiquity who gives the right judgment on this legend is Lucian, who declares in his RpoPlEvOs i KaKiaaos that it suggests a vulgar quarrel in a cook-shop. Aeschylus showed his regard for high tragedy by refusing to allude to it in his great drama. But he borrows many other motives from Hesiod: the cruel punishment,6 the further torment of the eagle, and finally the deliverance by Herakles, to which in the Hesiodic narrative Zeus appears to consent reluctantly, merely, as it seems, for the increase of the glory of his beloved son. But Aeschylus owes much also to Pindar, from whom, as I have tried to prove in my commentary on the Eighth Isthmian,7 he borrowed the momentous motive of the prophecy concerning the child of Thetis. But this was in no way connected with the Prometheus-legend by Pindar, who would probably have rejected it with strong reprobation. The combination of the two motives so as to form the keystone of a great trilogy we may believe to have been a mythopoeic achievement of Aeschylus himself. But his indebtedness to Hesiod is greater still, in respect not only of the variety of his motives, but of one momentous religious idea common to them both. In the Prometheus-legend of the Hesiodic poems and of the Aeschylean drama Zeus is presented as an evil God, hating mankind. The Hesiodic narrative of the fire-theft and the sacrifice shows the crude naivete and feeble-mindedness of folk-lore, with a weak veneer of higher theology; it is only of importance as expressing the feeling, occasionally discernible in the popular mind, of the malignancy of the divine powers. But generally this has been overlaid by the prevailing belief in the goodness of God: and I have tried to show 8 how this higher conception was inevitable and won its way in the more advanced and even in the more primitive religions. Even in the crudest Greek mythology, outside the Prometheus-legend, only the faintest hint is ever given of an evil God or of a God essentially hostile to man: Homer may be giving us real folk-lore when he records that Poseidon was wroth with the Phaeacians for their saving men at sea, and Walter Scott attests the same feeling surviving in his own day in the Hebrides. But the Hesiodic narrative, though clashing with the better thought of Greece and with his own better thought, was not impressive enough to produce a disturbance in the spiritual world. It is otherwise when this crude and immoral piece of folk-lore is taken up, developed and raised to the highest pitch of poetry and religious emotion by the genius of Aeschylus. For the Prometheus Vinctus must be called the chef d'euvre of religious drama. It is religious poetry on the heights; and there is no imaginative reader 6 He does not allude to the vile Oriental torture of impaling, to which a phrase in Hesiod appears to hint, Theog. 522. 7 Vol. i, p. 288; vol. ii, p. 38o. 8 Attributes of God, pp. 163-67.</page><page sequence="4">THE PARADOX OF THE PROMETHEUS VINCTUS 43 conversant with Greek who is not thrilled by it. Therefore it might well have been a fateful crisis in the history of Greek religion, when the High God of the whole nation and of the world-for Zeus is more than a national God-should have been represented before a great gathering of the people in all seriousness and solemnity as utterly evil, hateful to men and hating them, callously ungrateful to his benefactor, cruelly tormenting one whose only sin was to have saved and helped mankind, also as obviously lacking the supreme qualities of omnipotence and omniscience. And Aeschylus has gone further in the process of representing him in the blackest traits: he borrows from Hesiod the further torture of the eagle, the despot's reply to the defiance of the Titan. And he also borrows from the older poet as a by-motive the narrative of the most discreditable of the amours of Zeus, his love-affair with Io. Such stories are necessarily stumbling-blocks for those who have risen above the level of anthropomorphic religion. It was only Pindar who had the power to invest them with poetic beauty and dignity, so that the divine amours that engendered Herakles, Aiakos, Aristaios might seem gracious actions for the welfare of mankind. But as told by Hesiod the lo-legend is graceless and degrading to Zeus; in his version Zeus commits perjury, so that henceforth there is no sin in the perjury of lovers. And the Aeschylean version is equally derogatory to the High God who is impotent to save his victim from the malignant cruelty of Hera. Prometheus may well appeal to this as a further proof of the cruel oppression of the tyrant God; and the Chorus shudder at the thought that they themselves might become the victims of divine lust. Finally, we may note that even the ministers of Zeus, Strength and Might, are depicted as specially brutal, and the Olympian Hermes as wholly contemptible.9 If we looked then at nothing beyond this play, we should feel bound to interpret it as a mighty and dangerous challenge to the whole Olympian religion. This is felt with all the greater force, as Aeschylus has lavished his powers in depicting the Titan as a noble and lovable being, so as to win for him our entire sympathy and admiration. And the judgment of Aeschylus was dramatically right. It is only because Prometheus is sinless and deeply wronged, able by godlike endurance and patience to win deliverance in the end, and holds the fate of Zeus in his hands, that the spectacle of a God nailed to a rock with a wedge through his quivering breast, doing nothing through the whole play but passively suffering, could be endured as a theme of great tragedy. If he were in any way a malefactor who deserved his torment, it might be a motive for the Grand Guignol, but not for the Attic stage. At the Ober-Ammergau Passion-play we should not endure the long spectacle of the crucified Christ, were it not for the sense of the triumphant exaltation of the divine man. In later antiquity, indeed, we find a condemnation of Prometheus in the Cynic school of philosophy, who maintained all civilisation to be evil; 10 9 On the other hand, Hephaistos shows some kindly sympathy with Prometheus, no doubt because he was affined to him as a brother-god in the Attic cult. o10 E.g. Dio. Chrys. Or. vi, pp. 91-92 M.</page><page sequence="5">44 L. R. FARNELL they could therefore regard Prometheus who civilised man as the principle of evil. We know that such a view would be impossible for Aeschylus and the Athenian of his period. As regards modern criticism, Mr. Thomson in his recent edition published by the Cambridge Press quotes some utter- ances both of English and German scholarship implying that Zeus was after all in the right. Prometheus was a rebel or an 'impertinent reformer' who deserved his punishment. Mr. Thomson rightly protests against such moral cretinism. But he himself is inclined to blame Prometheus gently for his lack of acoq(poaivy, when under torture he hurls unmeasured defiance against the High God, who retaliates by sending the eagle.1" Now coqPpooavn, measured and well-balanced self-restraint, was a virtue in high regard among the Greeks; but the torture-chamber and the rack are hardly the places for its exercise: they did not blame the brave and devoted hetaira who under torture bit out her tongue and spat it in the tyrant's face. We do not expect politeness from the victim of the Inquisition when under treatment. And we should not have loved and admired Prometheus more if he had cowered and whimpered before his tormentor. A writer of the fourth century B.c., Douris of Samos, conscious of the religious immorality of the older story, finds a justification for the eagle-torture by perverting the legend: the sin of Prometheus was his attempt to violate the maiden Goddess Athena, and therefore the eagle devours his liver, the seat of lustful passion.12 For moral purposes, we may believe, partly to justify Zeus, Douris has transferred to Prometheus the sinful attempt of Hephaistos, his brother-god. Aeschylus was never more inspired than when he wrote those words of defiance for the Titan; 13 his poetic sympathies at least seem to be kindled to a white heat, and he can hardly have calculated coldly or desired that his audience would blame his hero for lack of moderation of language. There were dramatic occasions when the Greeks might applaud, not acoppoaqvn, but a stormy outbreak of moral indignation from a free man or a free God, from an Antigone, a Kassandra, or a Prometheus, although a timid Chorus, sitting on the fence, might be thrilled with the terror of the words. The Chorus of divine maidens, the Oceanids, tremble at the boldness of the Titan and implore him to be careful: this is the bourgeois function of all Choruses; but they show their final judgment of the righteousness of his cause by refusing to abandon him and determining in spite of the warnings of Hermes to share his final overthrow; thus commending themselves to us as the most lovable of all Greek Choruses and more faithful than the disciples of Christ. But it has been supposed that Aeschylus himself indicates his own feeling that Prometheus has somehow sinned: the Chorus gently 'put it to him,' ooX 6p.s O-t ifjaprEs; (1. 276), and on the face of it this might appear to mean that they thought he had sinned in giving men fire and saving them from misery. If so, that need not be the verdict of Aeschylus, 11 ' The wrath of Zeus is a disease, the unrestraint of Prometheus is a disease,' p. I I. 12 Miller, FGH. ii, Fr. 19: his new version blurs the violation, but that is implied. 1a 11. 180-90; 939-59; 985-95; io19-28.</page><page sequence="6">THE PARADOX OF THE PROMETHEUS VINCTUS 45 for the Chorus are by no means always the mouthpiece of the poet; but that cannot be their meaning, for Prometheus accepts their suggestion at once, KWV K&amp;6V fapTov, OiK &amp;pvi aopat: and he can only mean, half ironically, that his whole activity was a &amp;papria, an error of judgment, in that he had championed the weak against the strong, never thinking that Zeus would repay him with such fearful cruelty. Aeschylus, then, does not allow us to discern any sin, still less any confession of sin, in Prometheus. And Zeus is the more cruel, the more ungrateful, as Prometheus is the more blameless. Such a delineation of the character of Zeus is in direct contradiction of the best Greek tradition from Homer downwards. In the serious religious thought of Homer, as has been often exposed, we have the fairly consistent picture of the High God as a righteous Judge, the Father of Gods and men, punishing the evil but befriending the good and grieving over the self-inflicted miseries of mankind. And this aspect of him was recognised in many cults and cult-titles found throughout Greece. He was not indeed regarded in the popular cult as devoted to active philanthropy, as the Aeschylean Prometheus claims to have been. No Greek God was definitely characterised as q&lt;ta&amp;vepoTrros until Asklepios, who in the later Pagan period was the nearest counterpart to Christ.14 But neither was any Greek God definitely ptaveppcoTros, least of all Zeus. And the strongest antithesis to the Zeus of the Prometheus-trilogy was presented by the masterpiece of Pheidias, the Zeus Olympios, wrought not long after the date of this play, and revealing him in accordance with the highest religious ideals of the race as the God of peace and mild benevolence. Also, the Zeus of the Prometheus Vinctus violently conflicts with the religious message that Aeschylus strives to convey in his other works. He is par excellence the apostle of Zeus, as Pindar may be said to have been of Apollo. And some of his utterances concerning the High God, those especially in the Oresteia, composed at a date not far removed from that of the Prometheus Vinctus, belong to the great religious poetry of the world. And the people before whom he represents Zeus as a cruel and unjust tyrant in this play he hails in the majestic lyric of the Eumenides as specially dear to that god: ' Hail, ye people of this city, ye who sit near the throne of Zeus, dear to his dear maiden daughter; and being beneath the (sheltering) wings of Pallas Zeus halloweth you.' 15 Here then is the paradox, which some scholars try to belittle, but no one has explained. A cheap and easy solution, of course, is always open to us when we find in a work attributed to a famous author a marked difference in tone or view from that found in his other works; we may deny the attribution and declare the work spurious. And so recently more than one scholar has been found to deny the authenticity of the Prometheus Vinctus, main- taining it to be the work of someone influenced by the scepticism of Jonia masquerading under the name of Aeschylus and writing to undermine the established religion. Mr. Thomson has sufficiently exposed the absurdities 14 Vide my Hero-Cults, pp. 276-77. x5 11. 997-1002.</page><page sequence="7">46 L. R. FARNELL of this view, and we need only lament that scholars who work upon the classics should be devoid of literary sense. Ruling out any possibility of doubt as to the authenticity of the play, can we evade the difficulty by the suggestion that Aeschylus imagines a distinction, such as we find in Platonic and Stoic theology, between a supreme transcendental God, the all-just ruler and beneficent creator of the universe, and the Zeus of the popular mythology, a limited and imperfect God? Even so, we should still have to explain why here, and only here, he should represent that God with such repellent traits; not merely as an imperfect God, but as entirely evil, and a hater of mankind. But that distinction is unreal for Aeschylus. In the decisive passage of the Agamemnon,16 the God of his highest religious vision is still the Zeus of the popular religion, and if our poet chose to reject the detrimental myths as Pindar did, there was no reason why he should not be. Other scholars, anxious to save the character of Zeus or of Aeschylus, try to find some ' theodicy,' some justification of the dealings of God with Prometheus and man. We are used to strange ' theodicies' in our own pulpits; but to none so strange as that which is half expressed or tentatively suggested by Professor Murray in his Rise of the Greek Epic: 17 all is well in the Aeschylean world, for the cruelty and the suffering end in reconciliation, peace and love; both Zeus and Prometheus have to go through a long period of probation and trouble from which they both emerge nobler and purified at the end: the spirit of love presides over the torture, because Zeus has just been carrying on an amour with lo, from which the future deliverer of Prometheus after thousands of years will be engendered. We ought not to accuse Aeschylus of wishing to preach us such a sermon. It was a far cry from Jo to Herakles: the amour of Zeus that was directly connected with Herakles and might be represented by such a genial poet as Pindar as an act of beneficence to the human race was that with Alkmena. We discern that Zeus is in strong need of purification; but the poet does not show us the dark spot in Prometheus that needs it, unless the tortured victim's bold defiance of the tyrant is a vice. And to suggest that Zeus's intrigue with the mortal maiden was suggested by a lofty purpose is a parody of the narrative; and to torture the innocent victim and at the same time by indulgence in lustful passion to provide for his future release does not give us an attractive theology. In fact no imagined concept can justify the heinous and ungrateful cruelty of Zeus against the friend of man. But we might imagine a moral explanation of his anger: we might suppose that Zeus intended to destroy the human race for its sins and to create a better, and that Prometheus thwarted him in this noble cosmic purpose. But there is no hint given by Aeschylus that Zeus intended to create a better; and in the Hesiodic poems, when Zeus destroys one race of men, a worse usually takes its place.I1S It would not occur to a 16 11. 169-83. 17 pp. 294-95. 18 It has been thought that 11. 566-67, o0TForTE &amp;rv At6s ppaovlaOv Ova-cr reapE ia povAal, expresses the poet's intuition of some higher purpose of Zeus which Prometheus has wrongly tried to thwart. The context is against this: the phrase is only a beautiful expression of the impotence of man: if Prometheus relied on man to save him from the wrath of Zeus he relied on a rotten reed.</page><page sequence="8">THE PARADOX OF THE PROMETHEUS VINCTUS 47 Greek dramatist to moralise the situation by suggesting a cosmic solution of the knot which involved the destruction of the human race: a good God for the Greeks meant one who was good for man. Another solution that has commended itself to many scholars,19 and notably to Wilamowitz 20 in his recent writings, is the theory of a progressive evolution of the Gods: like men they may develop from a lower to a higher state: in crude, primeval days they ' had their fling' and did wild things: then they became civilised and developed into higher moral beings: he quotes as examples the Erinyes softening into the Eumenides; and the vindictive God of the earlier period of the Old Testament, whose cruelties may be pardoned on the ground that at that time he was still young. I do not find these parallels at all helpful: the Erinyes were placated and became friendly to the Athenian people; any God or Goddess might pass through that process; but how far their morality was improved by the trial is not clear. And the God of the Hebrews starts much higher up the scale than the God of Prometheus. But the theory breaks down, because this moral evolution of the High God was never believed in by any who believed in the God at all. And I am convinced that Schmid was right when he said, 'Griechisch ist solche Vorstellung vom Heranreifen der Gotter nicht.' 21 Those who generally fail to realise how serious is the religious convulsion set in motion by the first play of our trilogy have supposed that the two following plays, the lpoi0lreOS Au6devoS and the lpo0.&amp;r's flupg6pos, may have cleared up the trouble and set things right. I do not find this credible: the moral character of Zeus has been blackened too deeply to be brightened on the traditional lines of the myth. The minimum demand we should make, so that he should win the forgiveness of Prometheus and our own, is that he should have deeply repented, should have turned from hating mankind to loving them, and should have released and reinstated Prometheus with adequate apologies and compensation. We note in our play that Prometheus vows he will not relent and give up the fateful secret which alone can save Zeus until the latter has at least released him and made atonement. All that we can gather from the titles and fragments of the lost plays and from a few statements in later writers does not suffice for a full reconstruction of their plots such as Thomson fancifully attempts; but only for a skeleton-sketch of the final drama. In the second a chorus of Titans arrives at Kaukasos to comfort their weary brother, possibly to persuade him to try humbleness. Herakles enters and receives guidance from Prometheus concerning his journey to the Hesperides: he shoots the eagle; Prometheus gives up the secret,22 possibly having first received a pledge from Zeus that as a reward he will be released: he is then set free and in the final drama, the THupq6pos, he was probably represented 19 Vide Thomson, Prometheus Bound, p. 12, n. 4. 20 Aeschylos-interpretationen, p. 150, and Glaube der Hellenen, ii, pp. 133-4. 21 Quoted by Thomson, op. cit., p. 12, n. 4. 22 It is certain that in the Aeschylean as in the later versions Prometheus gives up the secret before he is finally released (Philod. HT. EaEp. ii, 41): this is a departure from his previous determination, P. V. 177; but the passage in Hyginus, Fab. 54, ' itaque fide data . . .' suggests that a mutual treaty was made between the two antagonists, and this might be drawn from the Aeschylean source.</page><page sequence="9">48 L. R. FARNELL as reinstated in his ancient dignity, as colleague of the benign Attic deities Hephaistos and Athena in some ritual where he appears in the solemn function of TTupp6pos, carrying a processional torch. Now we cannot say with any precision what part Zeus played in the reconciliation. We have a phrase preserved from the second play, uttered by Prometheus, apparently after Herakles has shot the eagle,23 'dear son of a hostile father,' which suggests that there was no sudden ' TrEptTrrEta' in the divine feud-Zeus is still angry, and it may be that his wilful son is acting against his father's will, but counting on his indulgence. At any rate, we may be sure that Zeus did not 'stand in a white sheet' or by any act of repentance or atonement restore himself to the moral veneration of the thoughtful worshipper. Nor do we know how or by what organ the poet set himself to vindicate the ways of Zeus. It would be strange if he put such a vindication into the mouths of his Titans, though they themselves may be now released and pardoned.24 We can understand his exaltation of Prometheus and his love of him. He was expressing what was probably the sentiment of the Attic people, especially the potters, who at the flourishing height of their art dealt with his personality nobly and sympathetically.25 Then when the poet took up the crude story of old folk-lore, discerning in it the possibilities of high tragedy, he allowed his creative imagination so far to carry him away as to present the astounding spectacle of the tormented and loving God, a new religious revelation; and thus came near to the brink of a crusade against the traditional and popular religion. He shrank from the brink, and patched up the breach in the end, and thus escaped a public prosecution for dOEPEla. But the first play remains unique and irrecon- cilable with the rest of pre-Christian religious literature. The wind of genius bloweth where it listeth. We can quote no parallel.26 We might say that he gives himself up wholly to his dramatic imagination, which comes near to shattering his normal theologic creed. We should expect that a play of such power and dangerous originality would have made a deep impression on contemporary Athens and on later antiquity. But no record gives us any hint as to the emotion it excited in the Attic people, who, as we know and as Aeschylus found once to his cost, could be dangerous when they thought that their religion was attacked.27 We must believe that it was a new and startling religious experience to the thoughtful Athenian in the audience: the shock was probably softened for him by the final play. What surprises us is the slightness of its proved influence upon later 23 According to Plutarch, Vit. Pomp. c. i, Pro- metheus says this to Herakles after he has been rescued. 24 This pardoning of the Titans had been men- tioned by Pindar, P. iv, 1. 291 : vide my edition, vol. ii, p. 167: the date of P. iv was 462 B.C., probably near to the date of the Prometheus trilogy. 25 E.g. on the Vulci vase, where he is represented standing majestically before Hera, who offers him a libation. Vide Roscher, Lexikon, iii, 3086. 26 Haig, Tragic Drama of the Greeks, p. 112, quotes Milton's admiration for Satan versus Jehovah; but if we scrutinise it we find no real parallel there. 27 Haig, op. cit., p. II I, expressed the opinion that the Athenian people would not have been shocked by the portrait of Zeus given in the Prometheus Vinctus. But he wrote without knowledge of the popular religious psychology.</page><page sequence="10">THE PARADOX OF THE PROMETHEUS VINCTUS 49 literature. We do not expect the incorrigible Aristophanes to have been impressed, whose figure of Prometheus in the Birds, skulking about under an umbrella lest the Gods whom he hates and who hate him should see him, is excellent fooling. We look in vain for any echo of it in Sophokles, unless we suppose that his lyrical masterpiece in the Antigone on the wonderful works of man is a silent protest against the Aeschylean doctrine which attributed all man's culture to a personal God. On the other hand, in a striking passage in the Supplices of Euripides,28 which ascribes a divine origin to our culture, we can recognise the influence of the great Aeschylean drama, although Euripides avoids mentioning Prometheus and is content with eE6S ats. We might well have expected to find clear reference or allusion to our tragedy in that famous passage in the Republic where Plato censures the great poets for narrating immoral myths or otherwise speaking blasphemously of the Gods, and twice arraigns Aeschylus on lesser matters than he might have arraigned him on if he had taken note of the Prometheus Vinctus. But here and elsewhere 29 he is entirely silent about it; and Aristotle also is silent save for one doubtful passage in the Poetics where he classes the Prometheus among the 'spectacular' tragedies.30 It is still stranger that the author of the treatise ' on the Sublime,' which gives the most sympathetic and penetrating literary criticism that antiquity produced, draws no illustration from the play that was the masterpiece of sublimity in ancient literature. It was certainly read in the Augustan and Imperial periods; but both Horace 31 and Vergil,32 in passages where they are dealing with the same or connected themes, write as if they had never read the tragedy. Of the later writers Lucian has dealt with the myth in the most original way with his usual satiric humour, (a) in the Dialogus Deorum,33 and (b) again in his treatise 1IpoJ10E s i KIKaKGaos; this is the severest moral indictment of Zeus, and he writes as if in a white heat of indignation; he certainly had the play of Aeschylus in his mind,34 but the borrowing is slight. Among the narratives of the later mythographers who deal with the story, it is only seldom that we can prove their indebtedness to the Aeschylean trilogy.35 Nor is there any clear evidence of its influence on later art, although we may suspect that Panainos, the brother of Pheidias, when he painted the deliverance of Prometheus on the screen of the throne of the Pheidian Zeus at Olympia, was influenced in his choice of subject and his manner of treatment by the great drama.36 28 11. 201-15. 29 In Protag. pp. 320 D-322 there is no hint of the Aeschylean handling of the fire-myth. In Gorg. p. 523D Zeus is said to have ordered Prometheus to deprive mankind of foreknowledge of death, from moral motives: we discern the debt to Aeschylus, P.
