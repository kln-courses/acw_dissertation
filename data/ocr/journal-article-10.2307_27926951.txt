<plain_text><page sequence="1">Israel Exploration Journal VOLUME 51 ? NUMBER 1 ? 2001 The Bull and its Two Masters: Moon and Storm Deities in Relation to the Bull in Ancient Near Eastern Art* Tallay Ornan Israel Museum The stele recently found at Bethsaida (et-Tell) on the eastern bank of the Sea of Galilee has once again directed scholarly attention to the iconography of the moon god represented by the crescent and to its role in ancient Near Eastern imagery. The stele (Fig. I),1 made of local basalt, was found on a small platform to the right of the outer entrance of the city gate. The excavators interpreted the complex in which the stele was found as an open-air sanctuary, which was destroyed in the second half of the eighth century B.C.E. The stele depicts an icon composed of figurative and non-figurative elements: the head of a bull mounted on a long shaft or pillar. Joined to the pillar and flanking it from both sides are two pairs of thickened down-curving elements, one above the other. A rather long and thickened diagonal line with a boss at the upper end crosses the pillar. The latter can be interpreted as a long sword hung on the shaft, with a small curving resembling the hilt of a sword at the top. To the right of the pillar, between the sword and the upper right curving element, there are small four globes. The head of the beast rests on the top of the pillar and is delineated by a curling line indicating its nozzle. It is flanked at its upper part by prominent ears. The head of the bull is surmounted by large inward-curving horns, which create an almost closed circle.

This visual pun is somewhat reinforced by the large horns dominating the depiction, which may also be interpreted as the representation of the moon crescent. Indeed, the conspicuous feature conveyed in the stele is the association between the crescent moon and the bull, as has been shown by Monika Bernett and Othmar Keel in a thorough monograph, published soon after the discovery.2 Bernett and Keel argue convincingly that the imagery conveyed in the stele from Bethsaida is part of a long and well established Near Eastern icono graphy pertaining to the depictions of the moon god of Harran. Similar Fig. 1. Stele from Bethsaida. depictions that associate the bull and the moon god are portrayed on three comparable stelae, two from Tell el Ascari and cAwas in Syria, and one from Gaziantepe in Turkey, as well as on other objects.3 However, as the bull is a frequent symbol of the storm god in the ancient Near East in general and in the geographic area where the stelae were found in particular,4 one should not rule out the possibility that both gods ? moon and storm deities ? were alluded to on these monuments. My aim here is to show that the ambiguity evident in the stele from Bethsaida with regard to figurative and non figurative representation is also reflected in the very selection of the bull as an icon pertaining to two deities. If correct, such an interpretation would serve as a case 2 Bernett and Keel (above, . 1). 3 M. Krebernik and U.

As fantastic creatures and beasts may mirror distinctive features of the gods that 'owned' and mastered them,5 or alternatively were represented by them, they shed light on similar characteristics that typified different deities. This observation may be used at times for understanding a wider scope of religious developments and their possible reflection in visual art. The Bull and the Moon Deity in Third-Millennium Representations From very early periods, the inhabitants of southern Mesopotamia were aware of the connection between the full moon and the tide of the rivers, which supply water to the fields and to all living things. For this reason, the moon god, in addition to his role as illuminator of the night, came to be regarded as a fertility deity, responsible for the herds of cattle and the marshland they grazed.6 The fertility aspect of the moon god was reflected in the image of the most powerful and virile member of the herd ? the bull ? used for plowing the fields. The close connection between the moon god and the bull is attested to in Mesopotamian literature,7 in which the deity was known as the 'frisky calf of heaven', the 'shining calf (lapis-lazuli bull), or the 'lord of wild bull', and was described as a patron of the herds of cattle.8 This affinity was strengthened by the similarity between the bull's horns and the 'horns' of the new moon, reappearing at the beginning of each month and symbolising the eternal cycle of nature.9 5 F.A.M.

The 'calf in these epithets should be understood as a bull-calf, referring to the young, strong and virile beast, rather than to the newborn animal. This is indicated, for example, by the granting of horns ? characteristic of the mature, potent young bull ? to the calf of Nanna (Stol [above, n. 7], p. 255). Similar uses of the bull and calf both relating to the divine are attested in the Bible, e.g. the Golden Calf and the Calves of Jeroboam (Exod. 32; 1 Kings 12:26-23). 9 Stol (above, n. 7), p. 255; Green (above, n. 8), p. 24.</page><page sequence="4">4 TALLAY ORNAN Fig. 2. Votive plaque from Nippur, Early Dynastic III period. The symbolic links between the bull and the moon, usually in its crescent form, are already manifest in Mesopotamian imagery in the third millennium,10 as exemplified on an Early-Dynastic votive stone plaque found in the temple of Inanna at Nippur (Fig. 2).11 The crescent is rendered in this case above a bull, symbolising cattle of the 'civilized realm', which is being attacked by a lion, an enemy of the herd, symbolising the steppes in the art of the ancient Near East, a visual metaphor that lasted over three millennia.12 The connection between the bull and the lunar deity is well reflected by a copper statue of a bull bearing a crescent 10 G.

Sumerian metal bulls14 as theriomorphic of the lunar deity. Such symbolism can be corroborated by the probable portrayal of the moon god Nanna enthroned on two crouching back-to back bulls, on a cylinder seal stylistically attributed to the Early Dynastic III period (Fig. 3).1* Clear representations of Nanna-Sin in his anthropomorphic form are known from the Akkadian period, in which the portrayals of many Mesopotamian deities were consolidated and in which the use of the lunar calendar was probably initiated.16 To these depictions of the moon god one may relate another rendering, rather common on Akkadian cylinder seals, in which a crouching bull serves as the mount for a winged gate or shrine, often accompanied by various emblems and 13 A.

These complex compositions make the interpretation of the scene in general and of the role of the bull in particular rather hard.17 However, links between the moon and the bull are somewhat clearer when a crescent accompanies the human-shaped figure (e.g. Fig. 4).18 In such a case, the winged structure above the bull may represent the celestial abode of the lunar deity.19 The supposed imagery connecting the bull and the moon god is harder to trace in the iconography of the Ur III period, a lacuna which is all the more surprising 17 Boehmer (above, . 16), pp. 105-107, Nos. 602-619. 18 Fig. 4: unpublished seal in Israel Museum IAA 65-71 (formerly Hahn-Voss collection), white marble, height: 2.4 cm., diameter: 1.2 cm.

A scene representing a large bull striding behind the enthroned figure of the moon god, identified by his crescent shaped tiara, is depicted on the western wall of room 132.22 The association between the bull and the enthroned lunar deity is enhanced by the scale patterned background.23 To this portrayal one should add two murals dated, on stylistic grounds, to the very early eighteenth century B.C.E., probably from the reign of Yasmah-Addu. Painted on the southern wall of court 106 at Mari, between rooms 64 and 55, they depict two sacrificial bulls adorned with crescents on their foreheads,24 which recall the copper bull from Tell el-Ubeid, mentioned above. The association of the bull and the moon becomes more evident during the Old Babylonian period: for example, on a number of cylinder seals and impressions, on an impression of Samas-ilum-dannum (dated c. 1765 B.C.E.) from Tell Leilan, on which the enthroned moon god recalls the mural from room 132 at Mari,25 and on a cylinder seal on which the enthroned moon god places his feet on a recumbent bull.26 However, as noted by Colbow,27 a more specific visual rendering connecting the bull and the moon deity can be traced to Old Babylonian imagery, in which the lunar deity is mounted on two crossed bulls, as seen on an unprovenanced 20 Colion (above, . 16), pp. 20, 22. 21 These may be shown, e.g., in the prominent role of Nanna in the birth episode of Sulgi, Klein (above, n. 8), passim and p. 102. The absence of imagery of the bull and the moon from Ur III iconography corresponds to the phenomenon of other motifs reappearing in Isin-Larsa (and later) periods, after having been omitted in Ur III iconography, as shown by E.

These artefacts became more common in the Ur III period, reaching their peak in the Isin-Larsa period and continuing into Old Babylonian times.36 The two bulls of the plaque shown in Fig. 10 are depicted vividly in a naturalistic rendering. Their physical details convey typical bovine features, such as dewlap, neck-and-upper-chest fat folds, characteristic folded front legs, muscular body with incisions on belly and rear, long tail somewhat upturned at its base and ending in an elongated tuft, and prominent horns emerging from a ball-shaped forehead. The moon crescent is mounted on top of a wide trapezoid trunk-like pole. Similar poles carrying divine symbols are known on other terra-cotta plaques, and although they seemingly recall a palm trunk,37 it would be more appropriate to interpret them as the mount of a divine emblem decorated with a scale pattern, which in Mesopotamian iconography implies a heavenly setting as well.38 The two bulls stand on a three course platform that stretches across the width of the plaque. It is decorated with small vertical incisions that may imply a brick podium representing a sacred enclosure or a dais, on which such a divine symbol would be located.39 Thus, while there is a reference to the celestial dwelling of the moon god above the bulls, there is an allusion to his earthly seat below them. An almost identical depiction is seen on a terra-cotta plaque in the British Museum, on which two holes for hanging are visible (Fig. II).40 The depiction of similar motifs on both cylinder seals and terra-cotta plaques is rather common in Old Babylonian art. By comparing the motifs that appear in both media, Auerbach reconstructed the origin for certain visual themes (such as a male worshipper or a seated bearded god), which first appear on cylinder seals and only later on the terra-cotta plaques.41 On other occasions, such as in renderings of Humbaba, Auerbach suggests that motifs appear first on the clay plaques, which may have served as a source of inspiration for the glyptic representations.42 Yet in 36 Auerbach (above, . 21), pp. 24-26. 37 .- .

Terra-cotta plaque in British Museum. other examples, the scenes depicted on the clay plaques may have originated in other artefacts, such as clay figurines or larger monuments.43 Nevertheless, it seems that with the theme of mounted crossed rampant bulls, it is difficult to determine its source of inspiration, as the two known plaques have no provenance which can provide any bearing on their dating. Similarly problematic is the exact origin of the plaques in southern Babylonia. Although most of the parallels shown here for the mounted crossed bulls originate in Sippar ? hence the plaques could seemingly be attributed to that site ? the emblematic representation on the backs of the bulls is reminiscent of the depiction on the cylinder seal from Ur (Fig. 9). Based on the appearance of the motif of two mounted crossed bulls on a sealing dating from the reign of Apil-Sin, we may offer here only a terminus post quern for the plaques, in the second half of the nineteenth century B.C.E. The appearance of similar visual themes, both on contemporary terra-cotta plaques and on cylinder seals, may attest to the popularity of this theme in Old Babylonian imagery. Semi-erect beasts standing on their hind legs, bending forward their upper body, are a well-known feature of Early Dynastic iconography, appearing 43 E.g., ibid., pp. 207, 210-211 (nude female and bearded man), 214-215 (man trampling dead enemies).</page><page sequence="14">14 TALLAY ORNAN especially on Early Dynastic II-III cylinder seals depicting combat scenes.44 Thus, the stance of the bulls in Old Babylonian representations continues a third millennium artistic tradition. This continuity, together with the appearance of the crossed, semi-erect bulls in Babylonia in the second half of the nineteenth-century glyptic and on various objects typical of the Old Babylonian period, indicates that although the depiction of two crossed animals is common among the Nuzi impressions, it should not be regarded as an exclusive north-Mesopotamian trait, as suggested by Porada.45 The choice of the rampant pose of the bulls in the Old Babylonian representations and the moon imagery emphasises the fertility aspect of the scene, as this is the stance bulls assume for copulation.46 Such specific positioning of the deity or his emblem stresses the virility of the deity, corroborated perhaps by the Sumerian literary metaphor describing Sin as a rampant bull.47 The Bull and the Moon and Storm Deities in Second-Millennium Representations With the close of the Old Babylonian period, the imagery connecting the bull and the moon began to fade. The diminishing association of the bull with the moon deity in visual representations may be explained by the introduction of a different visual tradition, in which the association of the animal with the storm god came to prevail. The latter, indigenous to the regions of Syria and Anatolia beginning at least in the twentieth century B.C.E.,48 became most proliferate in Old Babylonian glyptic.49 The introduction of this imagery into Mesopotamian art is usually attributed to the west-Semitic population, which entered Mesopotamia at the close of the third millennium and during the first half of the second millennium B.C.E.50 Accordingly, depictions of the storm deity on a bull are already evident in the Ur III period, in which, as pointed by Leinwand, half of the portrayals of the deity show him mounted on a bull, while half continue the older Mesopotamian tradition of displaying him above a lion-dragon.51 The new role of the bull as the sacred beast of 44 Frankfort (above, . 39), p. 53, text Figs. 20-21, Pis. x:d,i; xi:b,c; xii.c.

This new visual facet of the bull only emphasised a different aspect of fertility, focusing on rainfall rather than on water originating in rivers. Interestingly, the two iconographical traditions of the bull are sometimes displayed side by side on the same object, as, for example, on the Old Babylonian early Mitannian cylinder seal mentioned above (Fig. 8). Such a coincidence, in which the same beast serves as a mount for two different deities, sheds light on the complexity of ancient religious imagery and thought, which apparently could tolerate sharing the same beast for different deities, as exemplified in mounting the storm god on the Akkadian lion-dragon as early as the Old Babylonian period.55 However, it seems that the ancient engraver of the seal (Fig. 8) took care to differentiate between the two visual signifiers. It seems that the Old Babylonian version of the two crossed rampant bulls was reserved for portrayal of the lunar deity, while the depiction of a single striding bull was confined to the rendering of the storm god. The bull symbolising the lunar deity continued an ancient Mesopotamian tradition originating in Sumerian iconography, and the rendering of the two crossed rampant bulls could be regarded as a development typical of Old Babylonian imagery. However, the single striding bull of the storm god replaced the Akkadian lion-dragon, the sacred creature of the storm god known as Iskur to the Sumerians, or Adad to the Akkadians.56 As mentioned above, the association between the bull and storm deities is well known on local Anatolian sealings from the late-twentieth-nineteenth-century B.C.E. Old Assyrian trading post of K?ltepe-Kanish level II,57 reflecting perhaps an even older, third-millennium Anatolian imagery.58 However, as noted by ?zg??, the portrayal of a god standing on a bull in conjunction with lunar symbols is not unknown from the local glyptic of K?ltepe II either.

Anatolian sealing depicting a bull, on which stands a god wearing a tiara topped by a crescent and a disc (Fig. 12).59 It is not clear whether the deity portrayed here in this sealing reflects lunar and bull imagery deriving from an older Mesopotamian (Sumerian) tradition, transmitted through Old Akkadian merchants, or whether it represents a local storm deity adorned with lunar attributes. If the latter possibility holds true, what we have here is an early example of what may be described as a visual amalgamation of storm and lunar deities. It is usually accepted that the quadrupartite disc with wavy lines is a variant of the Babylonian sun symbol, known as samsu or niphu in Akkadian.60 The combination of such a disc with the crescent is known at least from the Ur III period.61 It became a common emblem among sealings from K?ltepe62 and a most 59 . ?zgu?: The Anatolian Group of Cylinder Seal Impressions from K?ltepe, Ankara, 1965, p. 74, PL xxiv:71.

Some associate it with a storm deity, while others see it as a general mark of divinity, specifically in the regions of south-east Anatolia, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, which may be compared to the horn tiara.64 The rather exceptional appearance of the crescent and-disc as part of the personal adornment of the god on the bull on the above-mentioned sealing from K?ltepe (Fig. 12) brings to mind the unique basalt statue from Hazor level lb (Fig. 13), although the two figures differ in size and detail.65 Whereas the figure on the sealing from K?ltepe wears the emblem on top of his headgear, the figure of the Hazor statue wears his on the chest. In addition, the crescent-and-disc emblems are depicted in opposite directions in these two examples. The Corns' of the crescent on the statue point down, with the disc displayed below it, while on the sealing, the crescent is shown below the disc with its 'horns' pointing upward, as is usually the case in glyptic examples. Nevertheless, these two figures both display male deities standing on a bull adorned with body or headgear ornaments of a crescent-and-disc emui?in.

Such a portrayal is seen on a relief from Malatya, where a deity wearing a horned tiara is topped by a crescent, holding 67 Krebernik and Seidl (above, n. 3), pp. 101-111; Colion (above, n. 61), p. 357; Bernett and Keel (above, n. 1), pp. 27-32. The lunar symbolism conveyed in the crescent and quadrupartite disc may now be confirmed by a crescent-and-a-disc engraved on the chest of a figure holding a huge krater on a new, unpublished basalt statue found at Hazor (IAA 97-3296). The disc on this statue, similarly engraved on the figure's chest, is divided into four major parts, each containing two additional 'storks'. The total of twelve dividers seen on the disc suggests a lunar symbolism, in which each divider may stand for a month.

To the well-documented examples brought by Bernett and Keel one may add here two seventh-century stamp seals depicting a crescent on a pole, associated with a quadruped, probably a bull. One seal was found at Nineveh (Fig. 14)75 and the other, presently in the Israel Museum, is of unknown provenance (Fig. 15).76 The protruding element on the head of the beast on the Israel Museum seal may identify it as a bull, although it could also be interpreted as a horse's mane. The latter possibility may be supported by the somewhat slender body of the beast depicted on the two seals, reminiscent of a 72 A. Akurgal: The Art of the Hittites, New York, 1962, Pl. 104a. A lightning fork carried by the storm god, identified by a Hittite legend, is seen on yet another relief from Malatya. The identifying legend appears here between the portrayal of the god with the lightning fork and the depiction of the god riding a chariot drawn to a bull, and thus may allude to his two attributes (ibid., Pl. 105; and see M.J.

The positioning of the crescent-on-a-pole on the back of a bull corresponds to other first-millennium representations studied by Bernett and Keel, in which bovine features are associated with lunar imagery. Most conspicuous among these are the stelae from Bethsaida, Tell el-Ascari, cAwas and Gaziantepe. These representations reflect what may be termed a first-millennium renaissance in displaying the bull as part of the moon god imagery. That iconographical trend could be connected with the ascending role of Harran in Syria and the promotion of its lunar worship, particularly by the Sargonid kings of Assyria. Of the ten known stelae depicting the crescent-on-a-pole emblem of Sin of Harran, two ? the stelae from Kizkapanli and Tavai? K?y? ? are ascribed to Adad-Nirari III and Shalmeneser IV The rest, it seems, do not precede the mid-eighth century B.C.E., and most date to the period of Sargonid rulers. Similarly, the distribution of crescent-on-a-pole seals in Syria and the Levant is mainly dated from the mid eighth to the sixth century B.C.E.78 In decoding the role of the bull on the stelae of Bethsaida genre, one cannot overlook the prominent position of the storm deity in ninth-sixth-century Aramaic inscriptions in general, his role as a head of a pantheon in some Aramaic royal inscriptions in particular, and the frequent use of his name as a theophoric component.79 Indeed, these textual attestations are supported by contemporary portrayals of the storm god accompanied by the bull, as is well demonstrated on several monuments.80 To these one should add the depiction of the bull, one of a pair the same workshop. The three seals are also related stylistically to the depiction on the base of an Urartian stamp-cylinder impression inscribed with a legend of Rusa I(719 713 B.C.E.), U.

Although a typical Egyptian scene, a god fighting the snake is also found in Canaanite imagery, interpreted as Bacal fighting his adversary, the god Mot of the Ugaritic Bacal cycle.85 A smiting bull-headed god and an enthroned bull-headed one, both identified with the storm deity, reappear on Phoenician seals, evidence that the use of the bull's head in portrayals of the storm deity continued into first-millennium imagery (Fig. 17).86 The combination of a human-shaped body and a theriomorphic head, typical in Egyptian iconography,87 sharply distinguishes these portrayals from other ancient Near Eastern renderings of the smiting storm god, and may imply some Egyptian inspiration. However, the use of the bull's head in these examples recalls the bulls' heads on the stelae of the Bethsaida genre, in spite of the fact that on these last examples they surmount a schematised human-shaped body or an animated pole. The association of the bull-headed deity on the Copenhagen stele and on the Phoenician seals with a storm deity88 strengthens the direct reference to the storm deity conveyed in the stele of Bethsaida and its parallels. 83 0.

For example, on the above-mentioned Maltai reliefs the winged bull of the moon god (third in the row) is identical to one of the pair of animals of the storm deity (sixth in the row).89 The same winged bull appears as the mount of the moon god on the stele from Ali G?r in the vicinity of Harran.90 Furthermore, as indicated above with regard to the wall relief from Carchemish, the moon god at times acquires attributes otherwise associated with the storm deity.91 One should also consider the war-like aspects of the moon god manifest on the Ali G?r stele and on a stele from Till Barsip,92 which are otherwise most typical in portrayals of the warrior storm deity.93 These war-like aspects are also reflected by the long sword hanging on the body or pole, depicted on the stelae from Bethsaida, Tell el-Ascari and cAwas, as shown by Bernett and Keel.94 Conclusions In addition to the lunar symbolism conveyed in the stelae from Bethsaida, Tell el Ascari, cAwas and Gaziantepe, one cannot rule out the clear association to the imagery of the storm god. This conclusion is endorsed by the long history of bull imagery in South-East Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, at least from the beginning of the second millennium and continuing into the first millennium, when the beast appears as a symbol of the storm deity. Although the deity displayed on the stelae of the Bethsaida group no doubt relates to the moon god on the basis of the iconography, I would suggest that the message conveyed on these monuments is more complicated and simultaneously refers to the storm deity as well. The bull depicted in these monuments associates them with the imagery of both the moon and the storm deities. It seems that the double role of the bull in this case grants the visual message of the monuments a certain ambiguity, which also corresponds to the combination of figurative and non-figurative portrayal conveyed on the stelae. An earlier mingling of lunar attributes with the storm god's imagery can be seen in 89 J. B?rker-Kl?hn: Altvorderasiatische Bildstelen und vergleichbare Felsreliefs, Mainz, 1982, pp. 210-211, Nos. 207-210. 90 Bernett and Keel (above, . 1), p. 44, Fig. 76. The in-folded legs of the crouching beast on the stele from Ali G?r is typical of the depiction of bulls; hence, the similarity of this creature to the standing beasts of the moon and storm deities on the Maltai reliefs may support their designation as winged bulls. 91 See above, n. 72. 92 Keel (above, n. 78), pp. 143-144, Fig. 10. 93 E.g., ANEP, Nos. 499, 501, 531, 532, 538. 94 Bernett and Keel (above, n. 1), p. 44, Figs. lc,d-e, 11, 12.

These two possible identifications of the icon with the moon deity, on the one hand, and with the storm deity, on the other, do not preclude one another. These deities share not only the image of the bull, but also roles associated with fertility and regeneration. The interchanging of divine attributes between different deities, as shown above, does not contradict ancient Near Eastern religious concepts, as the polytheistic theology conceived the world as being simultaneously governed by several divine entities. The question that arises here is whether such visual 'unification' of varied divine signifiers may imply some degree of syncretism, even though this is not recorded in textual evidence. It is hard to determine whether what we face here is a moon god with 'storm' attributes or a storm deity with lunar features. However, bearing in mind the preeminent role of the storm deity in the regions of Syria, Lebanon and Israel, I tend to favour the second possibility. This conclusion may be supported by the fact that clear lunar symbolism became more noticeable in the regions west of Harran only with the advanced Assyrian conquests, from the time of the Sargonid kings onward. The probable fusion of varied divine images into one icon seen from the perspective of first-millennium religious history, which faced the emergence of unification of all deities into one and then into an exclusive entity, brings another dimension into the discussion, which is beyond our factual conclusions.96 Although a belief in one god, Ahura Mazda, became an official state religion only during the Achaemenid period,97 some kind of henotheism ? a belief in one 95 E.A.
