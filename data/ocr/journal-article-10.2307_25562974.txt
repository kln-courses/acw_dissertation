Silvery trees laden with fruit rise in arabesques from rubble. It appears fabulous, a phoenix ascending. But Lot's Wife II is an un forgiving work. It promises an experience of seduction, a transporta tion into poetic reveries, but it refuses to deliver. Daphne Wright has been living and working in England for six years. Her installations of multiple cast plaster components have ma nipulated imagery of the domestic and public contexts of cultural identity. They have been read primarily within the discourse of the post-colonial Irish/English experience. Lot's Wife II is a densely described pear orchard. The trees are made of tinfoil compressed about steel rods and wire armatures. Each tree is supported by a clod of concrete. They are placed in a formation which implies a once orderly cultivation, become the ir regular topography of an archaeological dig. The trees are gnarled and bent by the blast of wind. Their consistent height describes a cramped but deliberate volume in the gallery. The old orchard is a cliche redolent of the secret spaces of fantasised childhood. The trees have human proportions but their proximity prohibits entry. The branches and twigs are wrought with studied detail: walking around, the network of growth shifts with the kind of parallax seen driving past a roadside forestry plantation. From one angle, corridors between the rows are apparent; from ninety degrees around, the trees knit into a thicket, like runaway blackthorn. The finest twigs are drawn in the air with painful fastidiousness. At these extremities the galvanised wire escapes its tinfoil cladding. Thicker boughs end abruptly as if dead branches had broken and the steel rod is bared like bone through flesh. Some of the trees are barren. Most of the pears on the rest are im plausibly large, distended, testicular. They are a disproportionately fertile yield for the cowed and almost leafless trees. The compacted foil of an occasional fruit has begun to peel and open. Like a ball of tinfoil or a trodden wad this well squashed foil has a redundant qual ity. Pears have a critical period of optimum ripeness - all here are immature or past their best. They hang in pendulous sympathy with their expected weight, but every so often an unlikely one stands up erect on its stalk. Little tinfoil birds, the generic shape of nineteenth century song bird automata, perch here and there. The pert stances suggest they would bob back and forth and twist their heads coquettishly on the one plane: the triumph of mimicry is reduced to a fistful of tinfoil. We are presented with a spectacle of excessive and finicky craft, of ornamentation run riot beyond use or exchange value. These are the aesthetics of fancy goods, of the gifts in the gift shop. They needle the niceties of taste. The grandiloquence and sentimentality are those of the Sunday colour supplement limited edition artifact: the belle or the bluetits in the sparkling glass dome. Like these 'objets d'art' Lot's Wife II combines the uneasy aesthetic bedfellows of nat uralism and expressionism. Expressionist gesture disrupts the analytical naturalism: branches cleave from the trunk at inflamed joints, the windswept forms crave anthropomorphic recognition. Expressionism is a language found excruciatingly gauche by our post-modern reserve. It indicates that we are 'meant' to 'feel' something. So we resist, embarrassed that we should be so petitioned. This production of disquiet functions as an integral strategy, intended to immobilise and distance our reading in the same way that the ornamental fussiness of making is designed to irritate us. The narratives of the work yield similar frustration. Most obvious of these is the nature/culture dialectic: the organic image rendered from modernist materials creates a pastoral exterior inside. It recalls explicit concerns of previous works: the sedimentations of planta tion, naturalisation, colonisation and assimilation. In Lot's Wife II the nature/culture dichotomy does not operate as anything other than a truism of representation. The image of the pillar of salt conjured by the title is reminiscent of the earlier plaster forms: brittle, austere and granular. The story of Lot's wife warns that to look backwards at whence you came is to be petrified and made inert. The orchard resides in this inertia. Read in relation to the history of Wright's work, Lot's Wife II represents the refusal to look back to once employed aesthetic techniques of seduction. The work is not kind to its audience. It does not release or extend its metaphors and narratives. It reneges on its promise of transforma tion and reverie, returning the audience to its discomforting figura tive cocktail. The pleasurable, melancholic sensation of disappoint ment engendered by other of Wright's works is here distilled into aggravating indifference. Lot's Wife II intractably, resentfully even, occupies the gallery. Its power lies in its refusal to play along, in its challenge to the preva lent expectation that Irish artists away from home will share their nostalgic anxieties and fascinations with their audiences. I saw Lot's Wife II three days after the Canary Wharf bomb. It was hard not to imagine how the tinfoil trees would crumple under a blast. A week later, the gallery was in a cordoned-ofF area after the Holborn bus bomb. The narratives of Irish politics exert themselves from without, even whilst the work itself stubbornly resists them. Irish artists in England battle with the Irish label. Shirley MacWilliam Shirley MacWilliam is an artist based in Sheffield. 5 4 CIRCA</page></plain_text>
