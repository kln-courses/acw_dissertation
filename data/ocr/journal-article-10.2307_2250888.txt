<plain_text><page sequence="1">III.-THE HUMAN SOUL AND THE COSMIC MIND. By WAi. PEPPERELL MONTAGUE. PART ONE. THE HUMAAN SOUL. I. THE Two THEORIES. FROM the beginnings of Earopean philosophy there have been two fundamentally opposed theories as to the nature of MIind and its relation to the perishable organism with which it is so intimately associated and upon which it is so pathetically de- pendent. The first and most congenial of these theories we shall call Spiritualistic Dualism. It is the theory that the minds of men and perhaps of animals have a reality of their own that is not completely dependent upon the living bodies within which they grow and by which and through which their career is largely determined. That the mind can guide the body in the light of its memories of the past and its plans for the future seems obvious. And as the captain who guides his ship can leave it and survive its destruction so can the mind survive the body on which it has made the voyage of life. Those who hold this theory of dualistic spiritualism differ among themselves as to the nature of the mind, as it is in itself and apart from the body. Some would regard it as a pure spirit lacking all material properties but inhabiting space and time. Others would go still further and regard it as a trans- cendental entity outside or beyond the spatial and temporal world. I shall not deal with these questions for I do not want the minor disagreements among dualists to obscure the major point on which they are all agreed in their opposition to their rivals, the Naturalistic Monists. The theory that I shall call Naturalistic Monism is the view that mind whether human or animal is an inseparable aspect of the organism and its processes, particularly those of the central nervous system. This monistic conception is not so congenial to our wishes and hopes nor even to our common-sense beliefs as is its dualistic opponent. Its great and growing strength is based upon science rather than upon naive feeling and expecta- tion. As science has advanced, and succeeded in explaining, or</page><page sequence="2">W. P. MONTAGUE: THE HUMAN SOUL AND THE COSMIC MIND. 51 at least in describing and predicting, the course of events in one domain after another without employing the conception of guidance by a spirit apart from physical phenomena, the con- viction has grown that men and other living organisms are in-- tegral parts of nature, more complicated in their laws than in- organic bodies but not essentially different from them, or at least not differing from them in such a way as to require explanation by immaterial agencies such as spirits. What we experience in ourselves as mind is then to be conceived as the inner aspect of certain processes in our bodies, and no more separable from or independent of those processes than. the shape, size or velocities of a body are separable from it. Such is the theory of Naturalistic Monism. It is, of course, what has been traditionally called materialism in that it regards Mind as an aspect or function of the material body. But those who hold the theory to-day do not like to be called materialists or even mechanists because they say that such names would convey an over-simplified and dis- torted impression of their view. Matter at the present time is regarded as composed not of simple little elastic spheres like tiny billiard balls but of complicated clusters of waves, and its laws are not the simple mechanical laws that sufficed to explain the behaviour of the old-fashioned atoms but highly complicated relations in which electrical and electro-magnetic factors are at least as important as those that are mechanical. Disputes about the meaning of words are so much less interesting than disputes about the nature of things,that we can afford to substitute for the labels of materialism and mechanism the labels naturalism and monism or naturalistic monism as acceptable names for the current theory that is opposed to spiritualistic dualism. In making this concession, however, we must be careful to remember that the new and complicated physics of the twentieth century with its concepts of Relativity and Quantum provides no more ground than did the older physics for the purposive or teleological type of activity that appears to be characteristic of mind. There are many contemporary theologians who have been rejoicing in the death of their ancient enemies, materialism and mechanism, because they have heard that the atoms of matter are packets of waves and that the laws of matter are at least as much electrical as mechanical. These theologians are cultivating a false hope and are doomed to disilluasionment for the reason that was just stated. Nature under the new dispensation is exactly as blind or purposeless as under the old. And it is as difficult to find a place for mind and its peculiar properties in the organism as conceived to-day as in the organism of preceding centuries.</page><page sequence="3">52 WILLIAM PEPPERELL MONTAGUE: II. THE PECULIAR PROPERTIES OF MIND. Of the many characteristics of the kind of reality which we call mnind or mental, I select for summary consideration those four which seem to be most fundamental and which contrast most sharply with the kind of reality which we call matter or material. They are: 1. Privacy. 2. Duration. 3. Purposiveness. 4. Integration. Let us, consider them in turn: 1. Privacy.-Everything that is mental is " private " in the sense of not being externally observable. If you were to cut open a man's skull and examine with the most powerful conceiv- able microscope every cubic inch of his brain you could niot imagine yourself observing any of his mental states. The simplest sensations or feelings and the most complex ideas or thoughts would be equally impossible to observe by anybody except the man who had them. 2. Duration.-Mental states are like material or physical events in that they succeed one another in time. The experienices of Monday like the physical events of Monday are followed by those of Tuesday and of Wednesday. But between the two kinds of succession there is an extraordinary contrast. In a sequence of physical events the later moments must exclude the earlier, while in a sequence of mental events the later moments can include the earlier. The material world of Monday must be over and gone before the material world of Tuesday can exist; but the experience of Monday's world is contained in the experience of Tuesday. Physical time has only succession, mental time has duration as well as succession. It would be nonsense to say that in a game of bridge the later hands could include the earlier, yet the player's experience of the later does obviously include in what we call memory the experience of the earlier. One con- figuration of the fifty-two cards in the pack gives place to another, and in the latter case no more than in the former is it possible for the past to be contained in the present. We are forced to con- clude that the property of duration which is the outstanding characteristic of anything that can be called mental, simply defies explanation in ordinary materialistic or naturalistic terms. This duration is of two kinds. There is the primary or con- tinuous duration which is called the " specious present ", and</page><page sequence="4">THE HUMAN SOUL AND THE COSMIC MIND. 53 there is the secondary or discontinuous duration which is called memory. If I make five taps on the desk, you are all conscious at the moment of the fifth tap of the four that have preceded and of the interval of time which they have occupied and which is continuous with the present moment. But if I ask you to think of a certain dinner party which you attended, last week or last year, you will be conscious of it as a part of your past, but, you will not have any clear or sensory consciousness of the series of events in your life intervening between then and now. This discontinuous or episodic awareness of our past is what we mean by memory or remembering. Henri Bergson, who was the first philosopher to emphasize the all-important factor of " duration ", or dure'e re'elle as he named it, believed that nothing of our past is ever really lost, though it may be buried so deep as to defy recollection at any later moment. Sigmund Freud and some other psychologists share this belief that memory is indestructible or immortal, at least during bodily life. I think that they are right. We drag with us through time, as a comet drags its tail, the steadily lengthening and deepening totality of traces of past experience. They constitute the private hell and heaven, the shame and the glory, that we have irrevocably built into the structure of our souls. 3. Purposiveness.-Anticipation of the future is the conse- quence and correlate of memory of the past. The possibilities which we can imagine and which we seek to actualize or to avoid are but the new combinations and rearrangements of what we have already experienced, and this third peculiar property of mtind which we call purposiveness is but another aspect of its second property of duration. The capacity of the present to contain and to pursue an imagined future is at least as difficult to explain naturalistically as its other capacity to contain a remembered past. And nothing in the configuration of cerebral atoms moving from place to place will in the least account for it. 4. Integration.-This fourth and last of the distinctively mental properties which I select for your consideration might be called "c organicity as well as " integration". The mind is perpetually integrating and organizing into unified systems the new elements which come to it. Not only do we assimilate into our conceptions our purposes and our characters the sensations which the en- vironment presents, but we organize the environment itself. All the products of culture, such as laboratories, libraries and churches, are projections into the external world and incarnations in the matter of that world of the mind's own structures, its hopes and fears and questionings. Mind informs matter, and transforms</page><page sequence="5">54 WILLIAM PEPPERELL MONTAGUE: the comparative chaos of its surroundings into a cultural cosmos that is nearer to its taste. And as Life, once started, spreads and ramifies over the grateful earth from which it springs, so does that higher type of life which is Mind wage a benign and creative war upon nature, imposing upon it its own unities of meaning and value. No greater slander of Life and Mind has ever been uttered than the biologist's charge that they are adaptations to environment. The truth is just the opposite. Mind and Life adapt the environment to their needs and though they may stoop to conquer, and conform to things as they are, their primary intent is always conquest-conquest through a process of assimilation, organization and integration, by which what ts becomes what ought to be. III. THE HYPOTHESIS OF A PHYSICAL SOUL. You will have gathered that I believe that Dualism has won1 its case, and that the opposing theory of Naturalistic Monism is quite unable to explain in its own terms the Privacy, the Duration, the Purposiveness and the Integration or Organicity that are the four distinctive characteristics of the kind of reality called Mental. But even if you are kind enough to agree that a victory has been achieved, the responsibilities of that victory are heavy and the real work has only just begun. For dualism, however true it may be, has always been scientifically sterile. The main work of science has been accomplished within the framne and by the methods of materialism or by what we agreed to call naturalistic monism. And for the purposes of science it is almost more important that a theory be fertile than that it be true. The soul and body of Plato and of Thomas Aquinas, the res cogitans and res extensa of Descartes, have given rise to insoluble problems as to the relation between the two opposed entities. And when we turni to contemporary dualists the case is the same. Bergson's jlan vital, Hans Driesch's " Enltelechies and William MacDougall's " animistic factors can none of them be intelligibly related to the bodies they inhabit. How can non-spatial spirit be imagined to interact with a brain spread through the space inside the skull ? And worse than that, when the tried and true categories of physics are abandoned or trans- cended there is nothing to control or discipline our thinking. Spirits, psychoids and spooks of all kinds can be had for the asking, ad hoc and ad lib, and we are apt to find ourselves wallowing iln the intellectual mud of occultism. The situation is like that whlich some of you may have experienced in playing a game of poker</page><page sequence="6">THE HUMAN SOUL AND THE COSMIC MIND. 55 "just for fun". Without the sobering control of a monetary stake, however small, the bets become irresponsible and fantastic, and the whole game degenerates into childish nonsense. Now when we find ourselves in this impasse in which we have to choose between the fruitful falsity of monism and the sterile truth of dualism, is there anything that can be done ? I believe that there is, and I request your attention to a certain hypothesis which I have very much at heart and which I think will fill the bill and really meet the needs of our problem. It is the hypo- thesis of a physical soul, something that possesses all the four peculiar properties that we have seen to be distinctive of mind, but which at the same time is capable of being described in terms of physics and described in such a way that its own nature and its relation to the body can be clearly understood. Let us begin by noting that Energy, which is the basic category of physics, and which can be roughly defined as the quantity of motion in a system, is of two fundamentally distinct types, kinetic and potential. Kinetic energy is actual motion whose quantity is measured by the product of the amount of mass that is moving and the square of its velocity; MV2. Kinetic energy is visible or externally observable. Potential energy is not visible or externally observable. Its amount is measured by the product of the force (ma) and the distance through which the force extends; ma x s. The quantity of potential motion ma x s is algebraically equal to the quantity of actual motion, mv2, which it is capable of producing. Now to whatever extent a motion is changed in direction its energy passes from the visible or kinetic form into the invisible or potential form. If the question is asked " What is this potential energy in itself? " a natural answer would seem to be that it is just the motion of the small particles composing the mass which had the visible motion. These motions are too small to see and in that sense their energy is invisible. This answer, however, will not do, for the simple reason that whenever the particles, be they electrons, atoms or molecules, have their motions changed in direction-their small kinetic energies will be partly or wholly transformed into small potential energies and the problem of the nature of potential energy will be back again on our hands. The answer given by the physicist is a different one. Potential energy is j ust the result of past motion and the possibility of future motion. In short, potential energy is nothing but potential; it has in itself no mysterious nature or actuality. I move a body upward or further away from the earth, and the kinetic energy of that motion is changed into the kind of potential energy that we call energy</page><page sequence="7">56 WILLIAM PEPPERELL MONTAGUE: of position. Or if I wind the stem of my watch, this motion of my winding will. be changed into the kind of potential energy that we call elastic stress in the mainspring, which means only that there is the possibility that the equivalent amount.of motion will slowly triclde back into the realm of external observation in the form of what to me will be the useful revolution that the hands of my watch make around its face or dial during the next twenty-four hours. But whether the potential energy is gravita- tional, elastic, electro-static or magnetic, it is in any case nothing but the result of a motion. that is past and the possibility of a motion that is future. If I ask the physicist whether there is. not something a little queer in the fact that a good concrete thing like a motion can pass into something that in itself is nothing and then emerge from that nonentity with its quantitative identity unscathed by its period of annihilation, he will brush the question aside as inconsequential or meaningless. It's merely the way things are. A state of affairs in which motion is observed will be succeeded by a second state of affairs in which motion is not observed. And that in turn will be succeeded by a third situation in which motion is again observed. The second state is the potentiality of the third state. And that is all that potential energy means. He might be good-natured enough to add that even if there were some hidden characteristic in the state called " potential ", it wouldn't interest him, for the reason that he as a physcist is interested only in what is externally observable. At this point I will ask you to consider a kind of episode which could arise in the case of two friends going out together on a hike. One of the friends is a follower of the strenuous life. He likes walking for its own sake, and he views the rests that they both must take as regrettable interludes, mere potentialities of further walking. The second friend is not at all of this type. He is lazy and contemplative, and he views the actual walking as regrettable interludes, mere potentialities of the delightful rests in which one can enjoy the view. The first and more energetic friend seizes the right to christen the alternating phases of the hike, and he names the resting periods as just potentialities of walking. The other fellow, were he given the opportunity, would do the naming in reverse and characterize the walking as just the potentiality of resting. Now to returnfrom fable to fact-when a sensory stimulus passes from a sensory end-organ such as a retina, a basilar membrane or a patch of slin, it proceeds as a current of kinetic energy, theoretically if not actually open to external observation, to the</page><page sequence="8">THE HUMAN SOUL AND THE COSMIC MIND. 57 brain, and there at the synapse the current is temporaily dammed up in the form of a potential and not even theoretically externally observable energy until it acquires sufficient intensity to spark across the gap between the neurons. Now suppose that at the moment when the energy of the current passes from the externally observable phase into the purely internal or potential phase, the man who owns the brain exclaims, " Ouch! I've got a sensa- tion I think we should all feel it was a pretty good bet that what from the external standpoint was a mere result of the past afferent current and a mere potentiality of the future efferent current of motor reaction, was in itself the sensation. In other words when the externally observable becomes nothing the in- ternally observable becomes something, namely a mental state. Now of course a pure physiologist would be quite indifferent to these mental states even if he were kind enough to admit their existence. For him as for the physicist it is only the stimuli and the reactions that would be of interest for they alone can be observed from without. But the man himself who undergoes these currents of neural energy could be pardoned if he felt it a little odd to regard his sensations and his entire conscious being as nothing but the possibilities of the bodily reactions to which they gave rise. So far I have been speaking more or less in allegories and fables seeking to placate your possible opposition based perhaps on your pre-existing assumptions. I want now to abandon this policy of appeasement and proceed to a definite offensive. And to that end I ask you in the colloquialism of the moment to " give me a break "-consent to view my hypothesis, if not with actual favour, at least with an open mind and a willingness to contem- plate sympathetically what I think are its implications. If you will agree to that, I can save time by stating those implications categorically or even dogmatically and without attempting much in the way of a justification of each point. Let me begin by confessing that what I said about the trans- formation at the synapse of one form of energy into the other was an over-simplification. Currents of kinetic energy are transformed in whole or in part into states of potential energy which are experienced as mental. But there is no one synapsis in which all such transformations occur. I am not attempting to revive Descartes' pineal gland as a cerebral centre at which the psycho- physical miracles take place. As we shall see in a moment, it is the complex field of force extending more or less throughout the brain, in which and by aid of. which the kinetic energies of the stimuli are changed into the potential energies that for us are actual sensations.</page><page sequence="9">58 WILLIAM PEPPERELL MONTAGUE: I think we may assume from what we know of ourselves that the intensive energy that constitutes a conscious state is not entirely expended in the motor reaction resulting from it. A specific trace appears to remain in the form of a memory image, and these traces successively superposed in an intensive hierarchy constitute the memory system. In the various forms of material- ism or naturalistic monism that have been and are still being advocated, the memory system or mind is regarded as an inner aspect of the kinetic energies of the neural currents flowing through the brain and nervous system. The defenders of this view have recently been making quite a point of speaking not of " a mind " and " a body " but of a " body-mind ", seeking to emphasize by the hyphen in this compound word the monistic identity or inseparableness of the mental and bodily components. We have pointed out the reasons why such a conception is untenable. The principal reason was that the successive moments of a sequence of motions are mutually exclusive so that there is no possibility of the later moments including the earlier and so providing for that duration of the past in the present which is the primary characteristic of everything that is mental. The theory that I am proposing does something new; it identifies the mental not with the kinetic but with the potential energies in the brain. By so doing we can clearly see that the four peculiar properties of the mental, as revealed by introspec- tion and seized upon by the spiritualist as justifying his dualism, can each be found to characterize a field of potential energy. Let us take each of them in turn: 1. Privacy.-Potential energy is the only thing definable in physical terms that is private in the sense of not being open to external observation. The moment when present motion dis- appears from view and becomes a mere potentiality of future motion, is the moment when the private or internally observable actuality of sensation makes its appearance. 2. Duration.-Even such a simple field of potential energies as can be carried by a coiled spring can have impressed upon it a series of kinetic energies, and then can retain superposed in an intensive hierarchy the successive members of the series. The temporal order is preserved and the spring when released can regurgitate in a new series of motions of recoil the series which it had received and retained. But during the period of retention the series exhibits not succession but duration which is the presence of the past in the present. 3. Purposiveness.-We have already seen that the imaginative anticipation of the future is, so to speak, the obverse of a memory</page><page sequence="10">THE HUMAN SOUL AND THE COSMIC MIND. 59 of the past. And any field of potential energy which is the result of past motions is by the same token the anticipative possibility of future motions. And while at first hearing it might seem fanciful to attribute purposiveness or teleology to a gravitational or electric field of force, it is not fanciful to realize that such a field determines the particles that come within its scope to a predestinred end. If the mind is such a field, though immeasurably more complex, then the series of actions determined by it would tend towards the ends that were in conformity with its structure. 4. Integration.-A field of potential energy or force exhibits something of the same power of integration or organicity which we found to be characteristic of -mind. Kinetic energies are passed on by " conduction ". One part of space gives up the motion contained in it to other adjoining spaces. But force or potential energy can be propagated by "induction ". The structure of an electric or magnetic field without itself being wasted can induce a replica of itself upon other material. The iron filings sprinkled upon a paper beneath which is a magnet, are integrated or or- ganized in conformity with the Faraday lines of force constituting the structure of the magnetic field. And if the mind is a field of force, we can see how each new sensation that it acquires is organized into its structure, and gets stamped upon it by a kind of induction a meaning that is in conformity with the mind as a whole. The mind as thus conceived is an organism within an organism. The living body takes its energies as contained in the food which it ingests and which by an activity akin to mind it builds up or anabolizes into its tissues. The brain, however, takes its most characteristic energies "neat " as pure motions of neural stimuli undiluted by matter. These energies are transformed from the kinetic into the potential type which are sensations, traces of which are integrated into the enduring fabric of memory. The mind as constituted in this way is not an adjective of the body any more than a plant is an adjective of the soil from which and within which it grows. It is no epiphenomenal concomitant of bodily processes. It is a substantive entity existing in its own right, a veritable soul, which may even outlast the perishable organism on which and through whioh it acts and upon which it so largely depends. The theory that I offer is then a real dualism; but please note that it is dualism with a difference. It is not, as are the traditional dualisms, open to the charge of being methodo- logically sterile and irresponsible. No less than the naturalistic monism which is its rival, it interprets the mind in terms of those same physical categories which are essential to genuine progress in science.</page><page sequence="11">60 WILLIAM PEPPERELL MONTAGUE: PART TWO. THE COSMIC MIND. WHEN we turn from a consideration of the nature of the human soul and its relation to the body to consider the hypothesis of a cosmic mind, we are impressed with the meagreness of evidence available to support such a hypothesis. If we lay aside the rose-coloured glasses of religious tradition and look at the cosmos coldly and with the naked eye of reason or at least of a merely secular imagination, we see a vast expanse of stars some of which like our own star, the smu, may have planets on which life as we know it could exist. Every hundred billion or so of these stars appears to be organized into what we call a galaxy, each of which rotates around its centre. The galaxies or star systems, extend through a distance of at least half a billion light years (that is for some sextillions of miles) in every direction as so far discovered. There are certainlv more beyond and their number may be in- finite. Nowhere among these sprawling galaxies do we discern, nor have we the slightest reason to infer, any structure however vast that resembles the living organisms that we know on our planet to be the vehicles of mind. Is it then more than an arbitrary fancy to suppose that the system as a wNhole, whether finite or infinite, could be the embodiment of a cosmic mind ? I think the answer depends upon whether or not we accept as sound the theory propounded in the first part of my lecture. If mental states are identical with forms of potential energy then the extent to which some sort of mental reality is present in the universe will be the extent to which potential energy is present- and that is everywhere. But the thought will immediately occur that the merely mental is not mind. Protoplasm is the only agency we know which acts as a trap for energy, and by means of which the traces of the kinetic currents flowing through it are preserved, accumulated and organized. In non-living systems there is mind-stuff but not mind. Energy is dissipated almost as fast as it is received and leaves no traces of sufficient strength to propagate themselves and to determine appreciably the behaviour of the system in which they may be stored. On the other hand, however, it would seem to be highly improbable that the particular combination of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, which constitutes our protoplasm and which can only exist under highly restricted conditions of gravity and temperature, should be the only combination of atoms to serve as a vehicle for those accumulations of potential energy that mean life and</page><page sequence="12">THE HUMAN SOUL AND THE COSMIC MIND. 61 mind. But whether or not there are other types of finite minds with other material embodiments than those we know on this planet, it is difficult not to believe that the cosmos as a whole possesses a completer unity than any of its parts, and thus con- stitutes an integrated field of energy having an organicity like that of mind and a memory from which nothing of the past could be wholly lost. There are, however, two roads " through nature to God ' and I propose now that we turn to the second of these roads and consider not the structure of the cosmos in space but its history in time in order to see if we can there discover anything indicative of the work of mind. Does the universe show any evidence in its behaviour of being created and guided by a mind that is both omnipotent and benign? To this time-honoured theological question the answer must be a flat negative. Nature is red in tooth and claw, and life is so constituted that each creature can preserve its existence only by devouring other creatures. The will to live is, as Schopenhauer said, a hungry will and feeds perpetually -upon itself. If there is a God, He is either not omnipotent or not good, in any sense of the word " good " that the human conscience can sanction. When transfixed on the horns of this ancient dilemma which is called " The Problem of Evil ", the theologian has usually preferred to save the omnipotence of God at the expense of His goodness. We are told that God works in a mysterious way His wonders to perform, and that His ways are not our ways. For a being with a conscience anything like ours such a God would be regarded as diabolical rather than divine if, uwith omnipotence to draw tpon, he had made a world in which 99 per cent. of his creatures were to suffer agony and defeat in order that one per cent. might thrive. And where does a vain- glorious anthropomorphism reach such a climax of impudence as when the defenders of this type of theology seek to explain and justify the misery inherent in animal life by declaring it to be the proper result of human sin ? As though anything that was done by so recent an inhabitant of this planet as man could justify the suffering that took place in the ages that preceded man's appearance! Might does not make right even when it is divine might. And power politics is as ugly a thing in heaven as it is on earth. To attribute to a God of Love the creation of the world of things as they are is blasphemy. Suppose then, that we purge our religion of the immoral notion of divine omnipotence and, freed from that embarrasment, look again at the course of nature. At once the picture changes and brightens. The conflict, tragedy and waste are still there, but</page><page sequence="13">62 WILLIAM PEPPERELL MONTAGUE: pervading them all we find unmistakable signs of an upward or evolutionary trend. As life advances it deepens and sweetens and by the growth of sympathy becomes broader and less dis- cordant. Through many a set-back and defeat this Increasing Purpose runs. No aggregate of blind forces however complicated could by a miracle of chance have given us even the life that we have, imperfect though it be. Everywhere throughout organic nature there is the sign of something like mind dimly but assuredly at work. And when we turn from biology to physics and from the little oasis of organic life to the vast desert of the inorganic by which all protoplasm is encompassed, we fitnd what is I think an unmistakable echo of one of the four primary characteristics of mental reality, the one which we called " integration " or "organicity ". Science does to be sure record everywhere the opposite of integrations. It finds disintegrations, katabolisms and break- downs throughout nature. Molecules disintegrate into atoms, and atoms by radioactivity disintegrate into sub-atomic cor- puscles such as electrons, protons and neutrons. Systems tend to pass from organization and differentiation into disorganization and uniformity. Energy tends to be dissipated and lowered in grade from molar or mechanical motion to molecular motion or heat, and finally to waves of radiant energy or light which is the most " dissipated " and least organized of all. This omnipresent trend used to be called the Law of the Dissipation of Energy, and also, under another aspect, the Second Law of Thermo- dynamics. It is now frequently called the Increase of Entropy, where the positive-sounding word entropy means the amount of uniformity, extensity, scatteredness and disorganization, which so far as significance anid utility is concerned is very negative indeed. To congratulate a sick friend on his increase of entropy would be to congratulate him on his increase of decay and dis- solutioni ! But is it not true that this sad trend in nature must have been preceded by an opposite trend which we can call anti- entropy ? Before there can be spending there must have been saving, before katabolism there must have been anabolism. In short there cannot be death unless there has first been life. Somehow or other the corpuscles must have been organized into atoms and the atoms into molecular and super-molecular systems as a prelude to the series of break-downs which were characterized as the dissipation of energy. I think we may say that most of the discoveries of science up to the present have pertained to the break-downs and to the processes incidental to them. It is true</page><page sequence="14">THE HUMAN SOUL AND THE COSMIC MIND. 63 that some syntheses of the less organized into the more organized have been observed and even created in our laboratories, but nothing that approaches the broad and deep integrations of nature has been accomplished by man. This is to be expected, for it is easier to destroy than to build up and far easier to under- stand the production of death than the production of life. Aristotle reminded us that what is last in the order of Knowledge is first in the order of Being; and there may come a time when a second volume of science is written in which not entropy but the anti-entropy which preceded it will, be the principal theme. And yet if that second and greater volume is ever written it may be written in a different language for the good and curious reason that the powers that make for integration and organicity are, as we have already seen, characteristic of what is essentially internal or mental, and as such not open directly to external observation any more than are the minds of other people. All this suggests a hypothesis which I do not think is too far- fetched or fanciful. It is the hypothesis that the anti-entropic power that must exist in nature as the cause of the organizations with which nature is filled is a mental power akin to what we find in ourselves. To call such a factor the Will of God would then be no empty metaphor but the very truth. For it is in Matthew Arnold's great phrase " a power not ourselves that makes for righteousness ". That it is not an omnipotent power is all too sadly obvious. Everywhere there is the conflict of wills and tendencies that makes for disorganization and pain. But among these varied tendencies, and leavening the chaos which they constitute, is the tendency to higher organization and to a higher harmony. But now in conclusion there is a final question that must be asked. If the cosmic mind or God is not omnipotent, does that mean that the chaos of nature is something butside God and menacing Him with a more or less unpredictable fate ? The brave Zoroastrians and after them William James, John Stuart Mill and many others who have preferred to save God's goodness at the expense of His traditional omnipotence have seemed to think so. With all respect to the great leaders of that school of thought, I cannot believe that in this point they are right. If there is a cosmic mind, or God, then everything moves and has its being within that Mind. I prefer to think of the chaotic tendencies of Nature as what Boehme or Meister Eckhart characterized as " that in God which is not God ". Cosmic evolution could then be regarded as the work of organizing the independent centres of activity in the divine mind that constitute its contents taken</page><page sequence="15">64 W. P. MONTAGUE: THE HUMAN SOUL AND THE COSMIC MIND. -distributively and as a plurality, and informing them more and more with the harmony characteristic of that mind when con- sidered in its collective unity. When viewed in this way and interpreted in the language of the noblest of the legends of ancient Greece, the Will of God would not be the analogue of any omnipotent Zeus but rather of the Prometheus, the Divine Rebel, whose heart was directed ,singly to the good and who waged an unyielding war against the Tyrant's claim that Right be subordinated to Might.
