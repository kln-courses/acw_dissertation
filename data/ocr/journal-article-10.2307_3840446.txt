<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sexual Freedom in Restoration Literature. By Warren Chernaik. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995. Pp. xii+268. $54.95 (cloth). Warren Chernaik's Sexual Freedom in Restoration Literature explicates and analyzes libertine ideology?or, more accurately, libertine ideolo- gies?as expressed in English poetry and drama ofthe last forty years of the seventeenth century. Chernaik's discussion centers on the works of Aphra Behn and John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, but also incorporates references to a wide range of other contemporary writers. Well-known plays by canonical authors such as William Wycherley, William Congreve, and Thomas Otway are discussed, as well as less familiar poetry by writers such as Mary Chudleigh, Mary Astell, and Sarah Fyge. Chernaik sees Rochester and Behn as representative of male and female perspectives on libertinism. However, as the discussions of individual works demon- strate, Rochester and Behn are not simply illustrative of opposite or al- ternative perspectives on libertinism. On the contrary, their works incorporate complex arguments and shifting perspectives, as they are at- tracted by, yet also critical of, libertinism and its philosophical and politi? cal implications. Chernaik opens by discussing the ways in which Hobbes's polit? ical ideas were incorporated into libertine ideology and deployed in</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 109 seventeenth-century sexual relations. This argument is developed with few references to other studies of libertinism in Restoration literature since they "tend to assume, rather than analyse or substantiate, the in? fluence of Hobbes" (p. 223, n. 1). Hobbes's comment that "felicity is a continual progress ofthe desire from one object to another" (Leviathan [1651] 11.63; quoted on p. 67) is central to the development of libertine ideology. Different versions of libertinism incorporated, in varying com- binations, Hobbesian conceptions of competition with a more genial perspective derived from Epicureanism. Chernaik pays some attention to Restoration interest in Epicureanism?Rochester translated Lucretius's De Rerum Natura (date not available) into English and Aphra Behn contributed an admiring dedicatory poem to her acquaintance Thomas Creech's published translation ofthe same work. Chernaik suggests that Hobbesian and Epicurean schools of libertinism developed and distin? guishes relatively happy-go-lucky Epicurean "rovers" such as Willmore in Behn's play The Rover (1677) from more aggressive and exploitative "rakes" like Horner in Wycherley's The Country Wife ([ca. 1673]; pp. 42-43). Yet Chernaik notes common elements as well, for "although the Epicureans asserted free will and Hobbes denied it, both divorced morality from any considerations of divine judgement, and postulated, at the centre of their imagined universe, deities which were remote, un- reachable, and in no sense anthropomorphic" (p. 28). Chapter 3 devel- ops the implications of this statement by focusing on the relation of libertinism to atheism in Rochester's work (with references to his cele- brated deathbed "conversion"). Most ofthe rest ofthe book analyzes the ways in which libertine ide- ologies constructed and represented sexual relations as a microcosm of, or metaphor for, political relations. Chernaik sees seventeenth-century English libertinism as competitive and predatory. "In every transaction, the assertion of freedom by one participant means the deprivation of freedom for another" (p. 4); ultimately "the ideology of libertinism can justify oppression in the name of freedom, liberating the will to possess and destroy its masochistic counterpart" (pp. 4-5). Aggression in liber? tine sexual ideology has particular political significance, as suggested by the frequency with which tropes of tyranny are employed by Rochester, Behn, and others to describe sexual desire; in Sodom (1684) and Valen- tinian (1685), for example, Rochester links "authoritarianism and the tyrannous rule of sexual desire" (p. 60). Arguing that Rochester's concerns are primarily philosophical and po? litical, in much ofthe first half ofthe book Chernaik focuses on the ways in which aggressive, angry, and sexually explicit representations of women in Rochester's works negate the possibility of desire, as the ex- pression of feeling is understood to be "surrender of power, humiliation,</page><page sequence="3">110 BookReviews defeat" (p. 13). In the last two chapters, Chernaik discusses the ways in which women writers, but primarily Aphra Behn, "challenge a double standard" by arguing that "sexual freedom . . . is no less desirable (if problematical) for women than for men" (p. 127). Noting that Behn's poems apply "the terminology of contemporary political debate to sex? ual relations, condemning as 'unjust' a conception of 'Freedom' which enslaves and tyrannises over others" (p. 143), Chernaik concludes that both Behn and Rochester analyze, from different perspectives, how "lib? ertine ideology leads to a cul de sac: one must be a predator to avoid being preyed upon" (p. 212). Chernaik is more interested in relating libertine ideology to political and theological thought than in analyzing libertinism in light of theories of sexuality. Although he does not explicitly position himself theoreti- cally, his frame of reference for discussing sexual development seems Freudian. He suggests that Rochester's "recurrent psychological pattern of anger, self-hatred, and repentance" is rooted in his fatherless child- hood with a mother who was a "strong-willed, manipulative country- woman" (p. 62) but does not offer a detailed analysis ofthe relationship. Nor does the work address more theoretical issues relating to sexuality? Chernaik briefly alludes to, but does not discuss, two works that have been very influential in recent discussions of the construction of early modern sexuality, Michel Foucault's The History of Sexuality (3 vols., trans. Robert Hurley [New York: Pantheon, 1978-86]) and Thomas La? queur's Making Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud (Cam? bridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1990). In a discussion of Behn's complex poems "Our Cabal" and "To the Fair Clarinda, who made Love to me, imagin'd more than Woman," Chernaik suggests that they "bring out the homoerotic element in an androgynous ideal of beauty" (p. 178) without tracing the relationships of androgyny and homoeroticism in these very different poems, or noting the differences in the ways the two speakers express desire for men and women. Chernaik's strengths, in spite of his sometimes labored style, are his engagement with Rochester's philosophical reading, and particularly his interest in making connections between a wide range of poetic and dra? matic works ofthe period, as he demonstrates how libertine sexual rela? tions in Restoration literature develop from and comment on political and philosophical theory.
