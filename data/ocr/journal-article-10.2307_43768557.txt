A few of them had already been published by other scholars, their shape as well as their representations being of special interest. After having started to assemble photographs of specimens readily available, amounting to about twenty, I told Professor A.D. Trendall on the occasion of one of the conventions in Taranto about my intention. With his unfailing enthusiasm and ardour to promote the study and knowledge of South Italian pottery, he began looking through his lists of Apulian vases for dishes relevant to my proposed study. A trip by car with my husband at the wheel through the provinces of South Italy, together with Professor Trendall and John Wade of the University of Sydney, who took some of the photographs reproduced in the plates, brought us to museums and private collections often in rather remote regions and yielded a rich harvest. Moreover, during the following two years Professor Trendall did not lose interest but continued to bring to my attention examples not previously known to me. Finally he was kind enough to let me have his latest attributions to the various painters, who decorated the dishes, taken from his forthcoming book written in collaboration with Professor A. Cambitoglou on the red-figured vases of Apulia: A.D. Trendall and Alexander Cambitoglou, The red-figured vases of Apulia (forthcoming). I am therefore deeply indebted to him for his generous support of my work on the flat- and knob- handled paterae. I am also greatly indebted to the following private collectors through whose kindness and generosity I have been able to study a number of important dishes in their possession: Dr Casuccio (Padua), Dr V. Chini (Bassano del Grappa), Mrs Aaron Dechter (Los Angeles), Cav. V. Lagioia (Bari), Loconte (Bari), Dr V. Macinagrossa (Bari), Macrini-Trentin Ceci Santina (Francavilla a Mare/Chieti), Signora Malaguzzi- Valeri (Bari), Dr Meo-Evoli (Monopoli), Professor L. Moccia (Pescara), Ammiraglio A. Ragusa (Taranto), Dr L. Ricchioni (Bari), Rossi (Bari), Dr Felice Torno ("H.A." Coll. Milan). I should also like to express my gratitude to the directors and curators of numerous museums all over the world for their courtesy in providing me with valuable information and for photographs, as well as for allowing me to study the dishes themselves in those places not too far away to be accessible to me. I am particularly grateful to the authorities of the museums in the following cities for their assistance in this regard: Agrigento, Altamura, Altenburg, Bari, Barletta, Basle, Benevento, Berkeley (California) Lowie Museum, Berlin (B.R.D. and D.D.R.), Bloomington (Indiana), Bonn, Boston, Brussels, Cambridge (Fitzwilliam Museum and Museum of Classical Archaeology), Canosa, Cefalù, Compiègne, Copenhagen, Dunedin, Foggia, Geneva, Genoa, Hamburg, Hanover, Karlsruhe, Lecce, Leiden, Leningrad, Limoges, London, Mainz, Malibu, Manchester, Marseille, Matera, Milan (Civico Museo and Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Università Cattolica), Montpellier (Société Archéologique), Moscow, Mulhouse (Musée Historique), Munich, Naples, Nara (Tenri University), New Haven, New York, Nice, Paris (Cabinet des Médailles and Louvre), Philadelphia, Prague, Rome (Villa Giulia), Ruvo, Sèvres, Stuttgart, Taranto, Toledo (Ohio), Toronto, Toulouse, Trieste, Vienna, Warsaw and Zagreb. vii</page><page sequence="4">Several firms dealing in antiquities have kindly supplied me with information about vases on the market, notably Galleria Serodine (Ascona), Münzen und Medaillen (Basle), Dr K. Deppert (Frankfurt), Charles Ede (London) and S. Dormont (Tel Aviv). My special thanks are also due to the following for their kindness and help in the preparation of this work: Dr J.Ch. Baity (Brussels), Dr Ann Birchall (British Museum), Professor H.A. Cahn (Basle), Dr Gemma Sena Chiesa (Milan), Dr P. Devambez (Paris), Dr A. de Franciscis (Naples), Dr Juliette de la Genière (Paris), Dr R.A. Higgins (British Museum), Dr H. Hoffmann (Hamburg), Dr Lilly Kahil (Paris), Dr J.H.C. Kern (Leiden), Dr Elena Lattanzi (Matera), Dr R.A. Lunsingh Scheurleer (Paris), Dr Giovanna Delli Ponti (Lecce), Dr F.G. Lo Porto (Taranto), Signorina Maria Reho (Monopoli), Dr Benita Sciarra (Brindisi), Dr Rosaria Stazio Pulinas (Bari), Dr D.G. Yntema (Utrecht). I should like to thank J.A. Begeer of Rotterdam, H.M. Croes of Eindhoven and Miss Judith Swaddling (British Museum) for the drawings. Thanks are also due to the Deutsches Arch. Inst. Rome and to John Wade (Sydney). Last but not least, I wish to express my gratitude to Professor E.W. Handley for accepting this work for publication as a Supplement to the Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies, and to the members of its staff for their assistance in preparing my manuscript for the press. viii</page><page sequence="5">LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS Fold-out I Fig. 1, la Newark Mus. 50.308 (F 11) Fig. 2 Würzburg Martin Wagner Mus.

Some large dishes may have a ring foot.2 The rim of both types is set off from the body and their systems of decoration are basically the same. Sufficient evidence for their Apulian origin is provided by the style of the representations, which in many cases may be attribut- ed to well-known painters. Some of them decorated both types of paterae, which in some cases were found together at the same site in Apulia (see the finds in Salapia, here note 5). The paterae can be divided into two classes3 - those with flat handles, which are comparatively few in number and may be called flat-handled paterae; and those with strap handles and knobs which may be called knob-handled paterae. Of the latter more than two hundred specimens are at present known (see note 5). The flat handles, which take the form of flat square plaques with varying contours resembling the handles of Corinthian column kraters of the 6th century B.C. and South Italian column-kraters of the 4th century B.C., are horizontally attached at the outer edge of the rim and secured to the body of the patera by curving supports (fold-out I). The strap handles of the knob-handled paterae are vertically attached to the rim, often inclining slightly outward. The handles themselves, which in many cases have one or more ridges, are straight or slightly bent up- or downward, generally with a round outline. These paterae may be divided into types according to the number of knobs: (1) Three knobs, one on top of the handles and one on each side rising from the rim; (2) Two knobs, on the rim without one on top of the handles; (3) One knob, only on top of the handles (fold-out II).4 On the whole there does not seem to have been much development of shape during the comparatively short period of production. Diversity of contour and depth of the bowl apparently occur at all times and do not indicate a special date or work- shop. The utmost one can say is that the very large specimens, which can be dated toward the end of the 4th century B.C., have characteristically short, broad and multi-ridged handles.</page><page sequence="13">PART I FLAT-HANDLED PATERAE The flat-handled terracotta paterae were produced during a more limited period than the knob-handled variety, although starting at the same time about 375-370 B.C. The production ceased around 330 B.C., some three decades before the end of South Italian vase painting. By South Italian standards the decor- ation is of high qualityģ Among the recorded find-spots Taranto, Canosa and Ruvo appear most frequent- ly. One specimen has recently been found at Salapia together with two knob-handled paterae.5 But for the earlier finds excavation reports are mostly lacking.

Differences concerning depth of the bodies and measurements of the handles and feet are not fundamental. Not many paterae of this kind are preserved in bronze and, without excavation reports, they are difficult to date. The oldest ones that are possibly datable seem to appear between the end of the 5th and the beginning of the 4th century B.C., but they can be traced also later in the 4th and the 3rd centuries.7 Some bronze specimens may be quoted, of which at least the find-places are known, although they are mostly not precisely datable. *BF 1 Salerno.

They occur on Attic vase-painting already in the early 5th century B.C. and are possibly of Greek origin, being in any case older than the terracotta specimens in Apulia. On the vases they always show only one round supporting handle, probably drawn from a strict frontal view and thus concealing the second one. Attic V 1 Berlin, Antikensammlung F 2309. Kylix.

Before a meal one used to wash one's feet and hands. At a symposion the patera would also be at hand, in case some symposiast wanted to rid himself of an overdose of food (V 1, V 2). However, the flat-handled patera was not the only type of container serving these purposes.8 As a footbath, though "misused", the flat-handled patera appears on the kylix of the Kodros Painter (V 4); Theseus smites Skiron with it instead of washing the giant's feet, as he was expected to do. On the Basle fragment (V 5) Odysseus uses the patera as a weapon for slaying the suitors.9 The purpose of the patera, possibly meant to be of marble, standing on a pedestal on the Karneian krater in Taranto (V 7) is hard to guess, but at any rate there will be some connection with the Karneian festival pictured on the vase. Bridal bath: large specimen, possibly meant to be of marble, on a low Ionic column. Pelike, Oxford (V 8). KNOB-HANDLED PATERAE ORIGIN In most cases neither are the proveniences known nor excavation reports available. So the extensive research executed by Andrew Oliver Jr. is of particular interest, for he reconstructed two tombs in Canosa, tracking down the material now dispersed among different museums and private collections,10 among which one knob-handled patera, now in the Metropolitan Museum in New York, could be identified. Furthermore, in 1969, two specimens, together with a flat-handled one, were excavated at Salapia (see note 5); Taranto, Ruvo, Canosa and Ceglie are the principal other recorded find-spots. VARIETY OF SHAPE AND ACCESSORIES OF KNOB-HANDLED PATERAE (Fold-out II) Body a) more or less deep and round contours b) more or less shallow and straight contours Foot a) different height, outline with varying curves and different degrees b) short and straight with different degrees at the lowest part c) conical, flaring downward without profile d) without foot, flattened bottom of body 11</page><page sequence="22">Handles a) strap handles vertical on rim 1 . slightly curved up or downward 2. ridged profile on surface 3. without ridged profile 4. outline above more or less round and underneath flat b) strap handles on rim slightly outward inclining 1 . slightly curved up or downward 2. ridged profile on surface 3. without ridged profile 4. outline above more or less round, underneath flat c) loop handles, strap type: on rim or on outer edge of rim, prolonged downward, fastened on body and rising U-shaped up to the rim right and left near the handle, where the knobs top them off. Knobs a) one knob on top of the handle b) two knobs on rim: one right and left from the handle c) three knobs: one on top of the handle, and right and left of the handle one knob on the rim d) no knobs Shape of knobs a) mushroom with stem b) pyramid with stem c) imitation knob: drop-shaped, without stem CORRELATION BETWEEN KNOB-HANDLED PATERAE IN TERRACOTTA AND BRONZE Although there is a certain correlation between the shapes of knob-handled terracotta and knob-handled bronze paterae, the similarity seldom amounts to more than ornamental details. The relatively simple decoration on paterae in terracotta occurs in bronze as part of a richer and more elaborate ornamentation. Furthermore, certain decorative details on bronze specimens continue with comparatively little change for a very long period.11 In the absence of publications and excavation reports, the date and even the place of origin of a number of bronze specimens remain uncertain. In any case the production of bronze paterae is older than that of the knob-handled terracotta paterae, which did not begin until about 375 B.C. and faded out about 300 B.C., whereas the early bronze ones can be dated in the second half of the 6th century B.C. (Pl. I, 2, 2a, BK 1). Main comparable features are: handles attached on rim, loop-handles, handle decoration like knobs, rosettes, girdle of beads, rings round the handle; animal protomes; foot under centre of body. Ornament: egg pattern, palmettes and wave pattern appear en relief in bronze and painted in terracotta. The following bronze specimens, chosen from a great number of paterae of different sorts provide suitable comparisons with knobbed terracotta specimens. 12 All of them, except BK 8 and BK 9 have 12</page><page sequence="23">almost identical tripods with lion's paws,13which are not found in the case of terracotta paterae.14 No knob * BK 1 Lecce 2694.

There are quite a few specimens which stand on a tripod, and are provided with different handles.15 One Attic 5th century example, however, at least resembles the terracotta specimens of the 4th century B.C.: the red-figured skyphos in Ferrara showing a patera without knobs, but with loop handle and ringfoot (here (5)). On Apulian vases there are specimens on tripods, and others resembling red-figured knob-handled paterae. Some comparable examples of illustrations on Attic vases (1) Copenhagen, Nat. Mus. I.N. 3877.

Milne thoroughly discussed the problem of the footbath (podanipter) and came to the conclusion that all sorts of paterae with different handles and feet served this purpose and were used for a great number of other activities as well (see here note 8). Reproductions of knob-handled paterae tell their own story. There is the tripod type and the one in the shape of the red-figured paterae. The tripod type especially seems to have existed in varying sizes, and ones with long legs must have been in actual use. The purpose of the paterae, whatever their shape, is in some cases clearly indicated, in others one has to try to deduce it, especially when they are lying neglected and turned over on the ground.

As the knob-handled paterae usually are reproduced with added white, white in our case stands for a metallic object, it may be assumed that the practical application as displayed on vases refers to bronze specimens. However, there is an indication which suggests the use of red-figured terracotta knob-handled paterae in daily life. A specimen in Genoa (1042 (Cat. 179) pl. XVII, 1 , la) shows traces of ancient repair. Along the edges of the originally mended fragments are rivetted holes, partly still filled with a piece of lead, the remnant of a rivet which had to keep the fragments together.16 Thus, paterae, as it is also known from other vases, were sometimes, at least, valued enough to be repaired when broken. Some of the above mentioned bronze paterae were also repaired in ancient times (BF 2, BF 6, BF 8). COLOURING OF KNOB-HANDLED PATERAE The appearance of red-figured paterae does not differ in colouring from the contemporary South Italian vases. Early examples have the usual orange terracotta colour of the ground wash (miltos), more or less of a light tinge: e.g. Iliupersis Painter and group: BMF 132 (F 1) pl. V, 1; Ruvo 817 (Cat. 203) pl. XX, 2. A warm terracotta shade occurs about the middle of the fourth century B.C.: e.g. Philadelphia L 6423 (Cat. 110) pl. XIV, 2. In the last decades the colour is becoming a really dark brownish-red: e.g. Bari 1395 (Cat. 158) pl. XV, 2; Marseille 2932 (Cat. 84) pl. X, 1, la-b; Brussels 383 (F 5) pl. V, 3; very dark: e.g. Taranto 8928 (Cat. 186) (Andromeda-Niobe). Different shades of black glaze with added white, yellow and golden-brown produce a lively effect, resulting from the special colour combination, of course with some variations. A black foot can be en- circled by reserved bands. The rim is mostly reserved, but also covered with black glaze. Sometimes the space under the handle is equally covered with black glaze. In rare cases the handles - mostly black - bear a branch in added white or white-yellow. The same colour is used for the rosettes on the knobs. Golden-yellow is increasingly applied for ornaments and details inside and outside on especially fine specimens. REPRESENTATIONS The representations on the paterae - flat-handled as well as knob-handled ones - are, with variations, arranged according to a structural system. There is usually a picture in the inside, the tondo, with the main representation on an ornamental baseline and the exergue below, filled with some decorative motifs. The entire composition is enclosed by an inner and an outer circle, the former usually geometric, the latter floral. The tondo can also be divided into two registers each with an equally important representation, usually separated by an ornamental band. In rare cases a picture frieze encircles the centre. A floral wreath, leaving the centre empty, occurs more than once. Just occasionally the entire inside remains black. 23</page><page sequence="34">Outside there are usually two representations, separated from each other by the ornaments of the handle area. The outside may also be left plain, either glazed or unglazed. Furthermore a floral or geometric band can run around the outside of the patera. Concerning the representations themselves: on the whole it does not seem to have been important which kind of representation is used for inside or outside decoration. There are some unique motifs which appear only in the inside, e.g. Helios on his chariot, as well as all chariot pictures, and the epiphany of Aphrodite. Neither pictures nor ornaments differ from South Italian 4th century vase-painting. It is the choice of subject-matter that has a certain significance. A special kind of representation is predominant whereas others are less frequent. Mythology is scarce, funeral scenes still scarcer. The bulk of the representations consists of single female heads, mostly in profile, in the tondo as well as on the outside. Altogether they account for approximately one third of the entire material. Often they are pictured rising out of flowers and surrounded by an elaborate floral design, much favoured in Apulia. The same occurs with entire figures. Of great importance are various figured groups, mainly consisting of three figures: Eros, girl (young woman) and youth in different compositions, repeated over and over again. When single figures are depicted like Eros, young woman or youth, they can usually be identified as excerpted from larger compositions. Eros, young woman and youth seated, standing or moving, offer each other gifts, such as fillets, bunches of grapes, wreaths, flowers, branches of laurel, ivy or myrtle, garlands, also situlae, phialai filled with eggs and sprigs, flat baskets filled with sprigs, ivy leaves or cakes of different shapes, called placous and pyramis, or a combination of both; another gift depicted was the large basket, or kalathos, destined for containing wool for spinning. Other women's objects like the mirror and the fan appear in great numbers among the gifts, as well as cistae, closed or open, and chests of different kinds and sizes;17 not to forget the magic wheel, the iynx.18 Also a parasol is occasionally held over a woman. A strigil may be found in the hands of a youth, and more often a dove offered to a woman. Long-handled and anthropomorphic-handled paterae appear less often.19 A ball to play with is known.20 A larger ball decorated with ribbons and suspended by a ribbon, is mostly carried beneath a phiale or cista by Eros as well as by the young woman.21 So far, only very rarely is there found a youth with a ball. The cross-torch, the bucrane, the hoop and the "xylophone" are South Italian items, first appearing on Apulian vases in the 4th century B.C.22 They are sporadically represented on the paterae. Short of any violent movement, the figures are always in some contact with one another. Even when seated facing in opposite directions or running in the same or the opposite direction, they turn back to look at each other. Mostly they are represented in profile.

Eros Nude youth with large wings, rarely with cloak over one arm, or seated on the cloak. After the middle of the 4th century B.C. getting more and more flabby with heavy, rather plump proportions; additionally acquiring an effeminate appearance with women's jewellery, hairdo and white shoes. Only occasionally the hair is cut short (Manchester IV C8 (Cat. 72) pl. XI, 4; East Berlin F 3348 (Cat. 199); London B M F458/F 10, pl. IV, 2, 2a. Young woman Young women are mostly clad in a long chiton with or without sleeves or belt. Made of transparent fabric, the garment falls in fine ample folds and is sometimes adorned with a dainty pattern (Ruvo 1617 (Cat. 1 89) pl. XVI, 4; Cambridge, Class. Arch. UP 144 (Cat. 185); London BMF 132/F 1 , pl. V, 1). 26</page><page sequence="37">In a number of cases a more or less ornamented seam runs around the neck and down the whole dress (Boston 7262 (Cat. 183), pl. XVIII, 1; Louvre CA 3204 (Cat. 37), pl. XI, 1; Pescara, Moccia (Cat. 90), pl. IX, 1; B M F 133 (F 12) pl. V, 2, 2a). When seated, occasionally a cloak (himation) is draped around the legs (Pescara, Moccia (Cat. 90), pl. IX, 1 ; Ascona, Serodine (Cat. 66), pl. VIII, 1 , la-b; Marseille 2.932 (Cat. 84), pl. X, 1, la-b). When standing, the himation can be arranged across the body in different ways (Pescara, Moccia (Cat. 90), pl. IX, 1; Ruvo 841 (Cat. 77), pl. XIII, 2; B M F 460 (Cat. 201), pl. XII, 3, 3a). Also a peplos with a loose overfall, short or long, can be worn (Ruvo 817 (Cat. 203), pl. XX, 2, 2a; Taranto 8928 (Cat. 186) (Andromeda-Niobe); New York, Schimmel/L.69.45 (Cat. 192), pl. XIX, 2, 2a-b. Belts: consisting of narrow ribbons, white or black, sometimes beaded, adjusted at waist height, and sometimes somewhat higher; often long ends are hanging down the skirt (BMF 466 (Cat. 81), pl. XII, 1; Taranto 61517 (Cat. 83), pl. XII, 2). The hair is mostly covered with some sort of cap, often adorned with an embroidered or woven pattern. There is the saccos with one or more slips at the back of the head; also the kekryphalos and the sphendone both open showing a thick bunch of hair held together by a ribbon. Also above the ears the hair is allow- ed to be seen. Very often a beaded or radiate diadem (stephane) is worn above the protruding hair of the forehead, where an extra ribbon is fastened underneath. Uncovered hair hanging down the back and tied together by a ribbon is favoured by the Iliupersis Painter (Ruvo 1618 ( B 5), pl. Ill, 2, 2a). A veil can be pulled over the head, or the himation can be pulled up from behind the back over the head to serve as veil (Pescara, Moccia (Cat. 90), pl. IX, 1; Taranto 8928 (Cat. 186) (Andromeda-Niobe, from behind the back)). The richly jewelled ladies wear different kinds of earrings like buttons or pendants of several types; single or two-rowed necklaces and bracelets are added. White shoes are often worn. One can say that the ladies appear to be dressed in accordance with the prevailing fashion of their time. Single female heads Single female heads, mainly given in profile, with hairdo, cap and jewellery, of similar appearance to those of heads of entire female figures. Youth Nude with cloak over one arm or over both arms from behind the back. White ribbon around the head, with short hair. Fully -dressed male figures In oriental costume (stage costume) as a rare case (Taranto 8928 (Cat. 186): Andromeda-Niobe).23 In samnite tunic and conical cap, as a single case (Würzburg HA 195 (F 15) pl. IV, 3, 3a.24 Pan With long white horns and a white ribbon in his hair, nebris and tail; however, no wild face, no beard, no goat feet (Warsaw 138501 (Cat. 180), pl. XVII, 3); still more humanized: featured as a youth with white ribbon and small white horns (Genoa 1042 (Cat. 179), pl. XVII, 1, la); with thick nose, knitted eyebrows and human feet (Taranto 8892 (Cat. 182), pl. XVII, 2).25 Satyr Featured as a youth with white dotted ribbon in his hair, human feet and tail (Ruvo 565 (Cat. 181)). 27</page><page sequence="38">Ornament The paterae - both flat-handled and knob-handled - are provided with a lavish supply of ornament, mainly as adjuncts. Wave and egg pattern, as well as the meander interrupted by squares, are very common dividing and enclosing figured compositions, as mentioned above. The astragalos occurs seldom. Simple short parallel black stripes are applied in some cases on the outer edge of the rim. Laurel, olive and vine leaf wreaths are the main floral ornaments, the former mostly berried. Besides there are different kinds of rosettes, some like a flat flower, others stylized as three-dot clusters, used in the field. There are various types of outside ornament in the handle area. There is always a fan-shaped centre palmette, which dominates the composition with a line starting right and left underneath it, and in some cases encircling the side palmettes without interruption, deviating at certain spots into scrolls and so producing a close complex (Fig. 1). Looser compositions give the side palmettes and scrolls more freedom (Ascona, Serodine (Cat. 66), pl. VIII, 1, la- b). Finally, we may note the typical Apulian exuberant decorations surrounding a figure or a single head, springing from a flower. The composition starts from a large central flower flanked on both sides by thick rising stems, often in shaded colours giving a plastic effect. Spirals, shoots, tendrils, scrolls, buds, a variety of flowers, rosettes, three-dot clusters, fruit, and sometimes little birds, produce a remarkable floral complex.26 Ornament (palmettes) 28</page><page sequence="39">PART II INTERPRETATION Daily life aspect As previously mentioned, the representations of certain stock figures and situations are not confined to flat-handled or knob-handled paterae, but occupy a great part of the South Italian vase-painting in the 4th century B.C. Interpretation therefore involves the consideration of a wide range of vases. Owing to the lack of literary documentation only a more or less individual approach, based on little more than hypotheses, is feasible. To leave aside for the moment the problem of their significance for every -day life or for the after-life, my view is that the vases reveal traces of an Eros cult, which is suppos- ed to have been widely spread throughout South Italy and Sicily in the 4th century B.C. among both the Greek and the native population (e.g. native: Würzburg L 869- HA 195 (F 15), pl. IV, 3, 3a. This Eros cult was probably concerned with the initiation of young women by fertility rites before marriage.27 Although it was possibly no outright mystery cult, essential rituals seem to have been cele- brated. A youth, presumably the bridegroom, took part in certain circumstances, and also a number of youths and young women met sitting down or moving, spending the festival together. Dionysos, the mighty god of fertility, is protector of the cult, but does not appear himself among the human beings. His power is incorporated in all rites, activities and objects discussed above: symbols and attributes of Dionysos, carried by the figures or spread in the field as adjuncts, give evidence of his influ- ence. In addition, symbols and attributes of Aphrodite, such as a dove, a swan, a mirror or a fan, reveal that this goddess too is included in the cult. She is the divinity of ever-blooming life.28 Like Dionysos she does not appear among human beings. Aphrodite Antheia and Dionysos Antheios bestow their bliss un- seen. Flowers, rosettes, branches with blossoms and fruit are their symbols, which are intended to en- hance vigour of life.29 Ornamental patterns such as the meander, egg and wave pattern, as also the palmette invoke the idea of eternal vitality.30 Eros is a personification of complex significance. God of fertility since prehistoric times, he is the Dionysiac Eros and at the same time important as the son of his mother.31 The swan, an attribute of Aphrodite, together with the Dionysiac symbols, underline his character (Ruvo 1710 (Cat. 21), pl. VI, 4; Bari 6459 (Cat. 22)). When administering cult rites to a young woman as a sacred initiation he is mediator between the two divinities and the human beings.32 His effeminate appearance marks his task in the women's cult.33 29</page><page sequence="40">The ball with ribbons carried in a special way, almost exclusively by Eros and young women, needs an explanation. Being of perfectly round shape, or at least meant to be, the ball was among other round objects, like e.g. the hoop (Ascona, Serodine (Cat. 66), pl. VIII) an orphie symbol of the macrocosmos.34 Its appearance in the context of cult scenes between Eros and a young woman may prove the importance of orphism in connection with fertility rites. At the same time it shows a kind of syncretism, blending together the orphie doctrine with the belief in the power of Dionysos and of Aphrodite. Undulating ground, indicated by rows of small white dots, flowers and growing plants suggest an out- door setting as also do the rocks of various forms, either a series of superposed rocks or with an irregular zigzag outline enclosing a hollow space. A rectangular frame stands for a window.35 Thus, it seems likely that the locality in question denotes a temenos or a shrine dedicated to Eros, although such is not known from literary source. To support the hypothesis which stresses that the representations are traces of an otherwise unknown Eros cult, a cult for females in South Italy and Sicily, there is the fact that scenes with Eros and youths are extremely rare, whereas those with Eros and a young woman are extremely numerous. Eros is sometimes seated on a rock receiving adoration from a young woman. His posture, holding a phiale or some other attribute - often more than one - is that of a statue (e.g. Milan, H.A. collection, 219 (Cat. 63), pl. VII, 1). In the same posture he appears also as a single figure (e.g. Barletta, 224 (Cat. 1 1), pl. VI, 2; Bloomington, 64.105 (Cat. 18), pl. VI, 1). Although no tradition survives, this then could be the image of a South Italian Eros statue, that is, a more or less free copy of one which was once in existence. One should not stress the point unduly, but it is worthwhile to take into consideration the three-quarter- sized Eros figure represented in the above-mentioned posture, with a young woman standing before it in veneration (pl. VII, 1 . Milan, H.A. Coll. 219 (Cat. 63)). Cult statues in three-quarter size were quite common in South Italy.36 A young woman seated on a rock in the same posture as a divinity will, however, not represent the image of a goddess, although there exist very similar pictures of Aphrodite.37 A mysterious cult affiliation between the goddess and the young woman can be assumed in this context. Eros administering a blessing to the seated woman is not the Eros statue come to life. He will be meant as the priest in the Eros cult in the guise of his god. As such he is also able to communicate in different ways with youths and young women. So, he runs forward together with a young woman, both equipped with votive gifts, to a place, not indicated, yet possibly to where the cult is to be performed, the assumed Eros temenos.38 Eros and a young woman can even be seated facing each other like human beings, seemingly conversing. However, they are never without their attributes and the picture is always crowded with the usual symbols. When several women, youths and Eros are together, congregated as in a social rendezvous, the sacred nature of the occasion is always made obvious by the attributes and symbols. Important are the scenes with the young woman seated in stately fashion in the centre of the picture, often on a richly decorated armchair. A youth, the bridegroom, has arrived with a gift, the most favour- able being a dove, Aphrodite's bird! Another woman is sometimes present with gifts for the bride. A small figure of Eros, now a personi- fied symbol - in the sense known from Greek art - in some cases hovers above the scene radiating 30</page><page sequence="41">"magie amoureuse".39 The attributes and symbols in the field are all well-known and turn the meeting into a sacred occasion, making it a part of the Eros cult. When a laver (louterion) is represented as well, and a woman administers a libation over it, then the laver for the bridal bath is intended as cult object.40 On the assumption that this scene is taking place outdoors, the laver also can be imagined as situated in the temenos of Eros. Another reason for putting forward the idea of an Eros cult in South Italy and Sicily is the conviction that vase-painters, as artists of some standing, would deliberately decorate their vases with significant representations, related to one another as a coherent series of pictures. At any rate a number of paterae should lend weight to this theory. Examples I The knob-handled paterae in Marseille 2932 (Cat. 84), pl. X, 1, la- b, shows on the outside: a) the adoration of Eros by a young woman, b) the initiation of a young woman by Eros. Inside in the tondo is the encounter between a young woman and a youth, presumably bride and bridegroom. A second woman with a large tambourine holds two phialai, filled with eggs, as an offering destined for the laver. The small figure of Eros is flying above with out- stretched hands, carrying a wreath and two phialai. This picture is among the richest of its kind, with almost every possible accessory to emphasize the sacred nature of the event. The pictures on the outside may be regarded as depicting the preliminary rites, starting with the adoration of Eros by the young woman, the bride; followed by her initiation. These rites completed, the inside picture shows the final ceremony, uniting the couple. The three representations thus convey the step-by-step process of the essential cult rites. Adoration at first, after that the initiation, and then the meeting of bride and bride- groom as the last and final ceremony. II A knob-handled patera in Ruvo 1613 (Cat. 159), pl. XV, 3 shows another combination of pictures. Outside: a) Eros and young woman, both seated, offering each other sacred gifts. Small white bucranes, suspended above, symbolize the influence of Pan. b) Pan and young woman, both seated, offering each other sacred gifts: a scene where Pan replaces the Eros priest or the youth. In the tondo Aphrodite, rising above a flower, surrounded by floral branches, is attended by two Erotes.41 Aphrodite obviously belongs to another world. Her image is a token, emphasizing protection of the bridal hope on earth. The attributes of the Erotes indicate the Dionysiac influence. III A great number of knob-handled paterae with a single female head as the central subject, associated on the outside with a variety of cult scenes, can also be regarded as an iconographie entity (pl. XIV, 1-5). However, not all single female heads appearing as emblems may indicate Aphrodite, although one can be reasonably sure that this is so whenever a small figure of Eros, a mirror or a fan is added. Otherwise it could be the emblem of Aura, Hera Eileithyia or, when wings are added, Nike.42 Ill a A unique, but badly damaged specimen in Foggia 129340 (Cat. 1 17), pl. XIV, 4, with a beauti- ful female head on the inside surrounded by a frieze consisting of a lion, a boar and two griffins - one animal missing - presents another problem. The female head combined with wild and mythical animals is likely to represent Aphrodite or Artemis, the latter as a woman's divinity protecting childbirth. In Greece both goddesses were in ancient times associated with wild 31</page><page sequence="42">animals.43 The palmette frieze intermingled with rosettes, running outside around the body, suits both goddesses as a symbol. IV Four paterae with Helios, whose cult was well established in South Italy, show the sungod as protector in connection with bridal scenes.44 IV 1 Bari 5928 (Cat. 161), pl. XV, 1. The rising Helios driving a quadriga, with fishes beneath the horses, may be seen as a symbol announcing new life. No pictures outside. IV 2 Paris Louvre K 174 (Cat. 162). The rising Helios driving a quadriga above the sea; dolphin and shells below; stars going down. Similar significance as Bari 5928 (Cat. 161), pl. XV, 1. No pictures outside. IV 3 New York Metr. Mus. 69.1 1.8 (Cat. 163). Upper section: Helios on quadriga, stars vanishing. Lower section: Eros and young woman seated, offering each other gifts; white dove behind the woman. Similar significance as Bari 5928 (Cat. 161), pl. XV, 1 and Louvre K 174 (Cat. 162). No pictures outside. IV 4 Naples 2576 (inv. 82244) (Cat. 164). Upper section: Helios on a quadriga; Eros flying before him. Dog chases deer, hare fleeing; in the field: the bunches of grapes and the ivy-leaf particular- ly convey the connection with Dionysos. Lower section: woman seated in centre, Eros approaches. The Eros scene with situla and ivy -leaves marks, like New York 69.1 1.8 (Cat. 163), the connection with Helios in the upper register. V Quite a number of paterae display a female driving a chariot drawn by four, three or two horses. Scantily provided with significant attributes, the females are hard to identify, though they probab- ly represent divinities. As they all are placed amidst Dionysiac Eros compositions, a significant connection can be expected. V 1 Naples 2699 inv. 82252 (Cat. 168). A star, probably the morning star, may indicate that the rising figure could be understood as Eos, who, like Helios, symbolized the propagation of new life with the new day.45 V 2 Berlin F 3349 (Cat. 166): A winged female without any accessories perhaps may be seen as Nike. (See also Altenburg 245 (Cat. 56); Benevento 386 (Cat. 55).) V 3 Leningrad 1689 (Cat. 171); Monopoli 221 (Cat. 170); Lecce 855 (Cat. 173); Naples 2646 inv. 82247 (Cat. 174); Naples 3377 inv. 82241 (Cat. 167); B M F 258 (Cat. 172); Vienna IV 451 (Cat. 57). Seven paterae show each a female, together with a deer, hound or hare. These females might tentatively be interpreted as Artemis.46 The combination with Dionysiac compo- nents would then indicate an adherence to Artemis and Dionysos as protectors of fertility.4 Some of these seven paterae require special attention. On Naples 3377 inv. 82241 (Cat. 167) the winged female with a deer may well be seen as a reminiscence of Artemis as an animal goddess, represented with wings in the seventh and sixth century in Greece and in the sixth century B.C. in South Italy, but who does not appear in the later period.48 V 3a Naples 2646 inv. 82247 (Cat. 174): No less interesting is the female wearing a Phrygian cap and an animal skin. She might represent the South Italian version of Artemis pictured in affiliation with Bendis.49 V 3b BMF 258 (Cat. 172): This patera bears the unusual combination of the assumed Artemis, seen 32</page><page sequence="43">in the upper section and an amazonomachy in the lower part. The Dionysiac note of the entire picture could induce us to presume an allusion to the battle of Dionysos against the Amazons before the port of Ephesos, the city of Artemis, whom the Amazons worshipped.50 VI Naples 2541 inv. 82255 (Cat. 175), pl. XVI, 1 ; Bari 5929 (Cat. 176); Germany priv. coll. (Cat. 177): Amazons appear as charioteers, while a Nike-head or an Eros scene is combined with them; or an Amazon carries a tambourine. This female tribe is brought into a more or less obvious contact with Dionysos and his cult. On the Naples vase the notion of a thiasos, though an unfamiliar varity of its kind, is caused by the Pan dancing in front of the quadriga. The Amazons belong here to the god's followers, to Dionysos triumphant, and consequently are incorporated in the Dionysiac Eros context.51 Further there are six paterae with a satyr or Pan in action. As the pictures are iconographically closely related to well-known bridal scenes, the mythological figures intensify the Dionysiac sphere more than the usual Dionysiac attributes and symbols. Whether the events on these six paterae have to be imagined as taking place in the course of the bridal festival or as stage performances remains un- certain.52 The same applies no less for representations with satyr and Pan on the pictures of the outside. VII 1 Ruvo 565 (Cat. 181): A satyr offers a patera with an anthropomorphic handle and a situla to a woman seated on an Ionic capital. The scene forms a counterpart to initiation scenes. VII 2 On a patera in Boston, 72.62 (Cat. 183), pl. XVIII, 1, the presence of a satyr turns the standard scene between two women - one seated, the other offering a gift - into an unusual Dionysiac one. The satyr, whose pedum indicates his favourite pastime, seems to be leaping forward away from the women, brandishing as he goes a flaming torch above their heads. VII 3 A patera in Hanover, 1974.2 (Cat. 85), pl. XVIII, 2, shows a laver marking a bridal scene. But, instead of the customary woman, a youth is seated in the centre of the picture, holding a phiale and a thyrsos. As the woman at the laver holds up a flaming torch towards him and a satyr approaches with a speaking gesture, the youth seems to undergo a special Dionysiac contact. VII 4 On a patera in Genoa, 1042 (Cat. 179), pl. XVII, 1,1a, Pan, deity of wild life, and a companion of Dionysos and Aphrodite, offers a syrinx and a bunch of grapes to a young woman seated on a rock, a procedure known from initiation scenes. VII 5 On a patera in Taranto, 8892 (Cat. 182), pl. XVII, 2, Pan leans against a laver holding a phiale and a club. With the woman standing before him holding thyrsos and tympanon, the couple are, so to speak, imitating a bridal scene, where Eros is replaced by Pan. Pan especially is said to be "guarantor of wedding water".53 VII 6 On a patera in Warsaw, 13850 (Cat. 180), pl. XVII, 3, Pan is playing the double flute before a young woman seated in the usual way on a rock, holding a fan. She is looking up at Pan with her head slightly bent and a deer standing before her. Both are listening to the music; a flower grows on the ground and a small figure of Eros is hovering above the scene. A dove, with a chain of rosettes in its beak, flying towards the woman, adds an Aphrodisian touch to this picture, seemingly more poetical than anything else, a kind of precursor of bucolic scenes of later ages. The scenes on the exterior are a reminder of the connection with the Eros festival. Two paterae show a variety of fishes on the inside picture, while those outside show different scenes connected with the Eros festival. 33</page><page sequence="44">VIII 1 New York, Coll. Norbert Schimmel L. 69.45 (Cat. 192), pl. XIX, 2. A large dolphin and a small fish fill the centre surrounded by an egg pattern. A frieze of four different sorts of fishes and a shell encircle the centre picture, which is surrounded by a wave pattern and a wreath of vine leaves. The outside scenes belong to the Dionysiac bridal festival. VIII 2 Boston, C.C. Vermeule III L. 171.1970 (Cat. 193), pl. XIX, 3, (fr.). Different kinds of sea creatures fill the large tondo. With two dolphins among them they are centred round a small shell in the middle. A wave pattern and a vine leaf band encircle the composition. Also in this case the connection with an Eros scene on the exterior is emphasized. Fishes and all sorts of sea-creatures, apart from being associated with the expectation of bliss in the underworld, are also linked with ideas of happiness on earth. Eros-Dolphin: the dolphin together with Eros is a symbol of love.54 Dionysos, dolphin and fish: the relationship of Dionysos and dolphin is illustrated by the legend of the fishermen, who were turned into dolphins by the god. A relationship of Dionysos and dolphin or fish seems to be the background of some drama or comedy: a Phlyax vase in Rio de Janeiro shows a Phlyax seated on an altar with pomegranates - possibly an altar of Dionysos - eating a fish in an apparently comic performance, while another Phlyax and a woman, the latter playing the flute, stand to right and left of another altar.55 In addition: Phlyax riding a dolphin, fragment probably from an Apulian vase with the representation of a chorus in a Phlyax comedy, likewise suggests the association of Dionysos and fish.56 Finally, there is another South Italian vase, a bell krater with a Dionysiac background, which features a fish. A satyr with a long knife intends to cut a huge fish on a fishmonger's block. A woman is pouring some liquid over the creature.57 CONCLUSION I The fact that the Genoa patera, pl. XVII, 1, la, bears traces of an ancient repair shows that the red-figured paterae were used in everyday life. Mended pots are worth keeping nowadays and so they were in ancient times. Hypothetical as the interpretation of the representations is, in certain aspects they seem to be centred on female life. Women's objects such as cista, kalathos, mirror and fan are attributes almost equally as common as the fertility symbols. Furthermore, Eros wears a woman's apparel and woman's coiffure. So it may fairly be assumed that the red-figured knob-handled paterae were mainly intended for women. There is at least one representation showing the knob-handled patera as a woman's implement. On the beautiful oenochoe in Ruvo (1618, here B (5), pl. Ill, 2, 2a) a girl is engaged in putting down a knob- handled patera on a piece of furniture. The woman before her is seated on a stool (klismos), ready to pour some liquid out of a presumably precious, black-figured lekythos into the patera.58 Apparently a ritual handwashing is about to be performed. From the left a second girl enters with an open cista, very likely a present. At the right side a third girl is playing with a bouncing ball. The scene takes place in the women's quarters, indicated by the column as a secluded spot. A richly embroidered fillet suggests a ceremonial activity. Hand-washing was practised as a bridal rite by women as well as by men.59 Like most of the illustrations of knob-handled paterae this one, too, is painted in added white and therefore must be considered to represent a bronze specimen. The terracotta paterae, on the strength of the pictures, may have been preferred by women, or it may have been the case that not everybody could afford bronze ones. 34</page><page sequence="45">Two almost miniature specimens, one in bronze (Bonn, here BK 10) and the other in terracotta (Taranto 4756 (Cat. 109), pl. XIV, 3) merit special attention. Very small, for handwashing, and not necessarily a substitute intended as a sepulchral gift, they may have been used as votive offerings in a sanctuary. The terracotta patera bears as an inscription the female name "Philista", applied in white paint. As it is not possible to identify the woman named Philista, we must be content with the idea that there will have been a specific and individual significance connected with the patera. Finally, there will also have been young men who owned a patera. Though representations of a single youth rarely occur, either in the tondo or as the main subject amidst other persons, they may be considered as designed for the bridegroom (e.g. Monopoli, Meo-Evoli coll. 960 (Cat. 60), pl. XI, 2; Bari, coll. Macinagrossa 34 (Cat. 61), pl. XI, 3). See also note 76. Sepulchral aspect Undoubtedly there is a sepulchral aspect to the flat-handled as well as to the knob-handled paterae. However, they are by no means the only type of vases used for that purpose.60 One flat-handled patera in Bari (6455, F 19, Pl. V, 4) shows on one side of the exterior a panathenaic amphora as a grave monument with mourning figures around; since on the other side there are three figures with Dionysiac attributes of the type known from the Eros cult, the association of the latter with sepulchral rites is evident. One knob-handled patera in Bari (8283 (Cat. 194), pl. XX, 3) with a funeral scene may be cited. A woman seated on a rock under a canopy - seemingly as an abbreviation of a naiskos - is attended by women with Dionysiac gifts.61 Knob-handled paterae are also reproduced on vases, where they appear in funeral scenes (e.g. on a stele: Bari 221 56 reverse of hydria, pl. III, 4) Swiss private collection (here B (7)). One of the most striking examples of the relation between sepulchral rites and pictures of the Eros cycle appears on a Campanian skyphoid pyxis by the Ivy-Leaf Painter. A laver, the cult object in bridal life, filled with offerings, stands in the centre of the picture, while on both sides of it a mourning woman is standing.62 On the other side of the vase Eros is seated on a rock holding a phiale and a fillet. The eggs in the phiale and the ivy leaves in the field strengthen the Dionysiac character of Eros.63 From a sepulchral viewpoint Dionysos and Aphrodite must be conceived as chthonic divinities.64 Pictures of daily life are invested with symbolic significance and may be understood as giving a mystic anticipation of blissful life in eternity. To quote some examples of the transfiguration of concrete wordly objects: the orphie ball is expected to produce magic in the life hereafter.65 Plants, flowers, floral and geometric decoration are frequently symbols of eternal Ufe.66 Fishes and all sea-creatures are assumed to know the way to the Elysium.67 The mirror, belonging to Aphrodite and used in bridal scenes is, however, apparently endowed with some magic power when used in funeral cult. As far as is known, the mirror was believed to reflect the eidolon, when held toward a funeral monument.68 The fan, when used in funeral cults, is likewise supposed to be connected with the soul. It seems that the subtle quality of the soul, fluttering, can be caught by the fan in a gentle breeze.69 Even the representation of Helios assumes an eschatological meaning. According to Pindar, his power reaches the other world.70 35</page><page sequence="46">CONCERNING MYTHS AND LEGENDS Different myths and legends of various origin often tell, independently of one another, that after struggle, disaster and misfortune, victory is gained. At an unknown period they were transformed in association with the hopes of life thereafter. The intrinsic factor is victory of life over death. With reference to the red-figured flat-handled and knob-handled paterae: when the winged Nike appears on the chariot (e.g. Berlin F 3349 (Cat. 166)) and Naples (2699 inv. 82252 (Cat. 168)), she can be interpreted in a transcendental sense. Hermes on the patera in Leiden, accompanied by the Dionysiac panther, is psychopompos, ready as leader to the Dionysiac Elysium (K. 1896.1 1.7 (Cat. 178), pl. XV, 5). Some legendary figures are pictured in the midst of their struggle, as a result of which victory is known to follow: Bellerophon (Taranto 9487 (Cat. 187), pl. XVI, 2); Phrixos (Berlin F 3345 (Cat. 188), pl. XIX, 1). Their fate is to be understood as a significant ending. Andromeda and Niobe appearing on the Taranto patera 8928 (Cat. 186) in a double picture combine hope and disaster. Andromeda still in agony will be freed as Perseus already stands by. Niobe mourn- ing her children is turned into stone.72 Nereids as marine deities are - like all sea-creatures - known in association with the underworld. In combination with the Eros cycle they shed a transcendental light on its blissful scenes (Cambridge, Mus. Cl. Arch. UP 144 (Cat. 185); Ruvo 1629 (Cat. 184), pl. XVI, 5, 5a). Since they also carry the armour of Achilles, along with Athena as protector (Bari 1395 (Cat. 158), pl. XV, 2) the blissful notion seems less clear than on the Xanthos-monument or the marine thiasos on Roman sarcophagi.73 In an amazonomachy, the amazons being the vanquished (BMF 258 (Cat. 172)) the Greeks appear as slayers of the personifications of evil. The amazons' transfiguration into death-demons seems to have appeared in the early 4th century B.C.74 There are certainly myths and legends telling of utter disaster. Pentheus, who had despised Dionysos, is slain by the maenads, while in contrast on the other side of the patera (Ruvo 1617 (Cat. 189), pl. XVI, 4) Dionysos and his followers are pictured. (See also Pentheus: Naples 2562 (F 4A).) Another problem difficult to solve is the fact that vases mainly concerned with female bliss were consecrated not only in women's graves, but also in those of men. An undoubted example, observed by A. Oliver Jr., is the knob-handled patera in New York, since it was found in a warrior's grave (69.1 1 .8 (Cat. 163». 75 Maybe the solution of the problem lies in the ancient people's perception of magic power emanating from a picture, in this case from aspects of women's expectations of life.76 In this respect the idea of eschatogamy, discussed lately by H.R.W. Smith, should be taken into consideration.77 F. Cumont per- ceives this same idea in Roman belief.78 Yet a few cases are known as more appropriate for dedication to men. The funeral scene on the pre- viously mentioned flat-handled patera in Bari 6455, F 19, pl. V, 4, will concern a male, as a youth is offer- ing a strigil (pl. V, 4). Further, loutrophoroi, mainly used as containers of water for the bridal bath, generally with representations of female bridal or funeral scenes, were occasionally used for men. There are South Italian specimens, the barrel amphora, decorated only with several wreaths round the body, thus quasi-neutralised, conveying the idea of eternal life in general. Two of these items are also found in the above-mentioned warrior's grave at Canosa.79 36</page><page sequence="47">Some Attic loutrophoroi of earlier date give through their representations more evidence in this respect. A white-ground loutrophoros of the second half of the 5th century B.C., now in the Louvre, can be quoted as an exceptional piece.80 The figure of a youth seated on the steps of a stele represents the deceased, while mourning figures are situated round about. L. Kahil has assembled a number of red-figured Attic loutrophoroi of later date, some decorated with battle scenes, others with stelai com- bined with names of battles, which obviously concern men (Kahil n. 77). G. Bakalakis supplemented the list, publishing the large so-called "Loutrophoros Schliemann" with elaborate representations of similar scenes.81 CONCLUSION n Life, myth and legend are one thing, eschatological philosophy and religion another.82 Whenever one wants to look at South Italian vases made for sepulchral purpose, worldly and mythological contexts should be considered as background. Life experience, myth and legend are transfigured, resulting in a transcendental meaning thus supporting religious ideas. Consequently pictures with bridal Eros scenes may be supposed to be based on bridal life on earth. The possibility of their containing traces of an Eros cult, celebrated at least in the 4th century B.C. in South Italy and Sicily, has to be taken into account. Finally, in the light of the above interpretation, two kinds of pictures may be distinguished, here with particular relation to the Apulian flat-handled and knob-handled paterae: (1) those with no obvious tendency toward sepulchral meaning: Eros-woman-youth, epiphany of gods and mythology included; and, on the other hand (2) those with obviously sepulchral representations. However, it is possible to transfigure every representation implying the Dionysiac Eros cult for sepulchral purpose in the transcendental sense.83 CONCLUSION III The South Italian vase painters were - as is well known - inspired by Attic vase-painting of the latter half of the 5th and the first half of the 4th century B.C. For their representations of the Eros and bridal scenes they took over entire compositions with Eros, who appears more and more frequently on Attic vases. Even pictures of a youth standing before a seated woman and the representations of the epaulia, a favourite theme on Kerch vases, are likely to be prototypes, transformed in a slow process until they acquire the typical South Italian aspect.84 Furthermore, there may have existed monumental and more authentic works of art, recording the rites of the Eros cult. As mentioned previously, there will have been sanctuaries or shrines dedicated to Eros. Their walls - as usually in temples and public buildings - will have been decorated with paintings, in this case reflecting the cult rites. Consequently, it may be assumed that the Attic vases were not the only source for the representations on South Italian vases. 37</page><page sequence="48">APPENDIX: EROS CULT IN GREECE None of the representations on Attic vases quoted above as prototypes are proof of a Greek Eros cult. Yet there is reason enough to postulate an Eros cult in Greece.85 Among a number of cult places, Thespiae seems to have been the most important, since an Eros cult had been celebrated there from prehistoric times until at least the 2nd century A.D. This cult must in part have been a woman's cult. Plutarch is reported to have visited Thespiae with his newly-wed wife to get the blessings of Eros, one of the oldest divinities of fertility. It was she who had to perform the rites.86 However, apart from the women's cult, every four years a festival with games played by young men took place at Thespiae in honour of Eros and the Muses.87 It is further worth mentioning that in the fourth century B.C. statues of Eros, by Praxiteles and Lysippos, were dedicated at Thespiae.88 The unwr ought stone that was originally worshipped seems to have received adoration all along.89 Some Kerch vases may reflect a kind of offering to Eros. A hydria in New York shows a seated woman who seems to be putting grains of incense into a kechron, which would burn and spread smoke. A thymiaterion stands nearby.90 A small Eros flies towards her. Another woman observes the pro- cedure, whilst a third woman is dancing with a tambourine before a seated satyr. On the lid of a lekanis in Leningrad a similar scene appears.91 Two women are seated at a table with a kechron on it. One of them, also, seems to be busy with putting some grains of incense into the kechron, while the other one watches lifting her right hand. Behind her stands Eros. An offer of incense in the presence of Eros? A love oracle, good or bad, depending on the way in which the smoke rises? 38</page><page sequence="49">NOTES 1 Dm. ranges from ca. 26-76.5; ht. ca. 5-23.5 cm.
