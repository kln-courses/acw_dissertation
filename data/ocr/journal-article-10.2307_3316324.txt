(Paris) Washington, D. C. SOMEHOW or other Hindu India and ideas of war do not seem to be consistent with each other. The name India brings us a vision of peace, of meditation, of tranquility and of philosophy, and the wanton killing of human beings seems entirely foreign to the culture. But an examination of some of the facts will show that India was far from a peaceful country in both prehistoric as well as in historic times, and that militarism has always flourished in India. Leaving their primitive home somewhere in Central Asia, ad- venturous bands of Aryans, the precursors of the modern Hindus, came to India, whether in quest of food or for plunder and con- quest we can only guess, and after putting the aboriginal inhabitants to the sword, they settled in the northern sections of the country now known as India. These precursors brought not only their culture with them, but also were imbued with a fierce warlike spirit and a hatred for the people they finally conquered. Unfor- tunately the conquered people have left us no record of these early combats, and our only account of this long war of centuries is handed down to us by the Hindu poets in a collection of hymns</page><page sequence="2">34 PRIMITIVE MAN known as the Rg-Veda, a work of absorbing interest in as much as it throws a flood of light on the origin of the myths and religions of all Aryan peoples. It has also the distinction of being the oldest work in the Aryan world. It consists of 1028 hymns comprising cver Ioooo verses, the number of words is computed at 153,826, and there are altogether 432,000 syllables. As can be imagined. the Rg-Veda is really a one-sided description of these wars, but a study of it clearly demonstrates the attitude of the conquerors towards the conquered. A great part of the Hindu mythology contained in the Rig-Veda makes the warlike spirit quite clear, and constant references are made to the wars with the aborigines. One of the most important deities of the ancient Hindus was Indra, who was also the favorite national god of the Vedic period and the warrior god. He is pri- marily a thunder god, and his especial feat was to conquer the demons of drought and darkness; but frequent references are made in the Rg-Vcda to the victories of Indra over the Da4yus, or the dark-skinned human foes of the Aryan invaders. Among his anthropomorphic traits he is said to eat the flesh of bulls, buffaloes and so on, and is spoken of as being born. His chief friends and allies are the Maruts, who are described as assisting him in his warlike exploits. He slays the demon Vrtra with his metallic bolt, releases the waters and places the sun visibly in the heavens. He is spoken of as the one compassionate helper, as the deliverer and advocate of his worshipers, as their strength, and as a wall of defense. According to Macdonell, Indra is pre-Vedic, for his name occurs in the Avesta as that of a demon, and the term Vrtra-slayer as the designation of the god of victory occurs there, though unconnected with Indra. It is therefore possible that there was already in the Indo-Iranian period a god resembling the Vrtra-slaying Indra of the Rg-Veda. Indra is addressed in about one-fourth of the hymns of the Rg-Veda. Another great deity of the Rg-Veda is Varuna. He too is in- voked along with Indra as the god of warriors. In one hymn we read: " Earth's ends appear enwrapt in dust, O Varuna And Indra; now the din has mounted to the sky; The onset of the warriors rolls close up to me: Come hither with your aid, O ye that hear my call."</page><page sequence="3">PEACE AND WAR IN HINDU CULTURE 35 And a little further down: " Both sides in battle conflicts call upon you two, O Indra-Varuna, intent on gaining wealth, Where once ye helped Sudas with all his Trtsu host, When by the ten kings' hostile forces hard pressed in fight," And again, comparing the qualities of Indra as the slayer of Vrtra, and of Varuna as the guardian of order, we read: " The one in battle conflicts slays the demon, foes, The other evermore his sacred statutes guards, We call on you with well-turned hymns, O mighty ones: To us, O Indra-Varuna, protection grant." We see then from the above sketch of only two mythological gods how important war was to the ancient Hindus, and later on in the course of our study we shall see that the veneration of heroes is carried down to modern times, and that war-like qualities are looked upon with greater respect than purely peaceable quali- ties. Talking of these ancient Hindus, Romes Dutt says in his masterly "History of India" published under the editorship of Prof. Jackson of Columbia University: " Every able-bodied man was a warrior and was ever prepared to defend his home and his fields and his cattle with his strong right arm. Every Hindu colony or tribe, while attentive to the worship of the gods and to the cultivation of the various arts of peace, was at the same time alive to the fact that its national existence depended on constant readiness for war. And the great conglomeration of Hindu tribes, which spread from the banks of the Indus to the banks of the Saraswati, consisted of hardy, brave, and warlike peoples who maintained their footing in the land and their independence and national existence by constant struggles and a determination to win or die." Leaving the domain of mythology and coming down to the purely historic period we find that war and militarism have been a dominant passion with the Hindus at all times. The army of Chandragupta Maurya, whose reign terminated about 298 B. C., was not a mean one. His dominions included the country now called Afghanistan, the ancient Ariana as far as the Hindu Kush range, the Punjab, the territories now known as the United Prov- inces of Agra, Oudh and Behar, and the peninsula of the Kath-</page><page sequence="4">36 PRIMITIVE MAN iawar in the far west, and probably also comprised Bengal; in other words, he was master of all India north of the Narbada. Chandragupta maintained the traditional " four-fold" army, namely, elephants, chariots, cavalry and infantry, and his military organization does not betray any trace of Greek ideas. Vincent Smith says of the Maurya army: " The force at the command of the last Nanda was formidable, being estimated at 80,000 horse, 200,000 foot, 8,ooo chariots and 6,000 fighting elephants. The Maurya raised the numbers of the infantry to 6oo,ooo, and of the elephants too 9,ooo. But his cavalry is said to have mustered only 30,000. The number of his chariots is not recorded. As- suming that he maintained them as in the time of his predecessor, that each chariot required at least three, and that each elephant carried at least four men, his total force must have amounted to not less than 690,000, or in round numbers 700,000 men. Megasthenes expressly states that the soldiers were paid and equipped by the state. They were not a mere militia of contingents. It is not surprising tl at an army so strong was able both to 'overrun and subdue all India ' as Plutarch asserts, and also to defeat the invasion of Seleukos, whose force must have been far inferior in numbers. According to the Arthasidstra an Indian army was organized in squads of ten men, companies of a hundred, and battalions of a thousand each. Chandragupta probably followed the same practices." Several centuries later, in the 7th century, A. D., the great Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang came to India. The account he has left us of the Indian army agrees in the main with that given above. He says that the army was composed of four divisions, and that officers rode in chariots. The war elephant was covered with a coat-of-mail and his tusks were provided with sharp barbs. While describing the army of Harsha of Kanauj, Hiuen Tsang credits that king with possessing originally 5,000 elephants, 20,000 cavalry, and 50,000 foot. After some years he is said to have increased his war elephants to 60,ooo and his cavalry to ioo,ooo. The Chinese traveller does not make any mention of chariots, neither does any one else after this period. So it is probable that chariots fell in disuse before the seventh century. The weapons used in warfare were both offensive and defensive. Of the former the infantry used a straight-edged broadsword</page><page sequence="5">PEACE AND WAR IN HINDU CULTURE 37 suspended by a belt from the shoulder. Besides this, javelins and lances and spears were used; and arrows were employed as pro- jectiles. Arrian tells us that the arrow was discharged with the pressure of the left foot on the extremity of the bow resting on the ground, with the string drawn far backwards and that " there is nothing which can resist an archer's shot-neither shield nor breastplate, nor any stronger defence, if such there be." During the protohistoric and historic periods arrows were tipped with arrowpoints of iron and bronze. But in prehistoric times chert, jasper, flint, agate and chalcedony arrowheads were used. In the United States National Museum in Washington there is a collec- tion of minute stone implements of different shapes, the use of which has not yet been definitely explained. Some of these im- plements were undoubtedly arrow points. These minute imple- ments coming from the caverns in the Vindhya hills belong to the neolithic period, but Wilson in describing them says that in India "there was no such hiatus between the paleolithic and the neo- lithic periods, and that the series of implements run from one period to another, their difference being accounted for by the general progress from the lower to the higher civilization." One weapon peculiar to India was the wheel or disk, cakra, which was thrown by the land with a twisting motion; this weapon is mentioned in many ancient texts, and the present-day representa- tions of the gods carry this weapon. Of the defensive weapons the principal were the shield and the coat-of-mail. One of the most important works on war and peace among the ancient Hindus is the Kautilya Artha~astra, whose author was CGnakya or Kautilya, a Brahman minister of Chandragupta Maurya. The ArthaAdstra is divided into 15 books or chapters. These chapters lay down general rules for the conduct of the king, give injunctions for the appointment of ministers and high priests, describe the important institution of spies or secret agents. Then follow a chapter on the king's council and one on the duties of ambassadors. The rest of the book gives rules for the king's sons and wives, for his daily routine, and for securing his personal safety. In the Artha'dstra it is said that the duty of the sup- erintendent of the armoury is to supervise the manufacture of certain weapons of offense and defense. There are instructions for the arrangement and care of these military equipments and an-</page><page sequence="6">38 PRIMITIVE MAN interesting list of weapons used in ancient Hindu warfare. Two kinds of weapons are recognized: the fixed and the movable, some of which today could very well be classed as heavy and light artillery. To the heavy artillery belong: sarvatobhadra or a cart with wheels capable of revolving rapidly, and thus throwing stones in all directions. bahumukha or a tower situated on top of a fort, provided with a leather cover or canopy and facing all directions. From this tower a number of archers or sharpshooters directed their arrows. visvasaghati, literally meaning "treacherous," or a cross beam above a ditch at the entrance of a fort which was so placed that it could be dropped on the approaching enemies and kill them. It probably served the same purpose as the portcullis of the Tower of London. Of the movable engines of war may be mentioned the pacialika or a big wooden board with sharp points on its surface which was placed in the water outside the fort to stop the onward march of the invading army; the devadanda was a long pole with iron nails attached to it, and was placed on top of the wall of the fort; and the siikarika was a leather bag filled with cotton or wool to pro- tect towers and roads against stones thrown by enemies, and served the same purpose as the sand bags used in the trenches in Flanders. The Arthasastra further mentions eleven kinds of weapons, among which are included a leaf-shaped weapon fitted with a handle, a rod with edges shaped like a boar's ear, bows made of palm, bamboo or horn, and three varieties of swords; swordhilts were made of ivory, wood and bamboo-root. Of the purely de- fensive implements of war are mentioned the jdlika, a coat cover- ing the whole body, the pat.ta, an armless coat, the kavaca, a coat made of detached pieces, and covering the head, trunk and arms, and the satraka, a covering for the hips and waist only. All these were made of chain-mail or of hides, hoofs and horns of porpoise, rhinoceros, bison, elephant or cow. And from a passage which says that: " Physicians with surgical instruments and appliances and healing ointments and bandages, and women with food and drink should stand behind encouraging the fighting men ", it appears that. the military organization included medical and am- bulance departments.</page><page sequence="7">PEACE AND WAR IN HINDU CULTURE 39 This book, the Kautilya Arthasastra is important not only to gain an insight into the mode of warfare of the ancient Hindus, but it also gives us a very clear picture of Hindu foreign policy. The theory of politics expounded there is substantially the same as the one advocated several centuries later by Niccolo Machiavelli in his II Principe. Just as Machiavelli says that the prince who " best personated the fox had the better success ", so does Canakya unblushingly say that " intrigue, spies, winning over the enemies' people, siege, and assault are the five means to capture a fort " and that " skill in intrigue or diplomacy is better ", for the clever diplomat can always overthrow kings who are superior in warlike spirit and power. The same work describes a moral ruler as vijigisu or " ambitious of conquest "; and lays down the policies that he who is inferior in strength to another must make peace with him; he who is superior in strength should make war: whoever thinks " no enemy can hurt me, nor can I hurt my enemy " should observe neutrality; those provided with ample aggressive means should attack their enemy; the weak should seek protection; to accomplish an object a ruler should make peace with one state and war with another, and so on. It is fair however, to mention that the Arthasdstra did not meet with universil acceptance, and one at least, has left us his opinion of the book in no very uncertain terms. In the seventh century, Bana, King Harsha's friend, wrote in horrified tones: " Is there anything that is righteous for those for whom the science of Kautilya, merciless in its precepts, rich in cruelty, is an authority; whose teachers are priests habitually hard-hearted with practice of withcraft; to whom ministers, always inclined to deceive others, are councillors; whose desire is always for the goddess of wealth that has been cast away by thousands of kings; who are devoted to the application of destructive sciences; and to whom brothers, affectionate with natural cordial love, are fit victims to be murdered? " This passage hardly needs any comment. BSna's aversion towards war, and his hatred for the Brahmans or the priests are self-explanatory. We see here how deeply he was influenced by Buddhist doctrines, and we know that Harsha of Kanauj became more and more a follower of Buddha in later life, and forbade the slaughter of anything living or the use of flesh as food under</page><page sequence="8">40 PRIMITIVE MAN pain of death without hope of pardon. Little wonder then that Bana, his intimate friend and biographer, should be so bitter against Canakya who advocated force and ruthless destruction. From what I have said before it may erroneously be imagined that the Hindus were entirely pitiless in their wars. Speaking on this subject, Dutt quotes several authors and says: " The laws of war were more humane among the Hindus than among other nations of the world, and Apastambha declares that 'the Aryans forbid the slaughter of those who have laid down their arms, of those who beg for mercy with flying hair or joined hands, and of fugitives ', while Bandhyayana says: 'Let him not fight with those who are in fear, intoxicated, insane, or out of their minds, nor with those who have lost their armour, nor with women, infants, aged men, and Brahmans.' Megasthenes also vouches for the humane laws of war among the Hindus. 'For whereas among other nations it is usual in the contests of war to ravage the soil and thus reduce it to an uncultivated waste, among the Indians, on the contrary, by whom husbandmen are regarded as a class that is sacred and inviolable, the tillers of the soil, even though the battle is raging in their neighborhood, are undisturbed by any sense of danger; for the combatants on either side, in waging the con- flict, make carnage of each other, but allow those engaged in husbandry to remain, quite unmolested. Besides, they neither ravage an enemy's land with fire, nor cut down its trees.' " But the Hindus did not always remain humane in their warfare. Towards the close of the tenth century a Turkish slave was sold to Alaptagin of Ghazni. This slave later became known as Amir Nasir-ud-Din Sabuktagin, and was virtually the founder of the Muhammedan dynasty in India. In 986 A. D. he made his first raid into Indian territory, and came into conflict with Raja Jaipal of Lahore. Hard pressed by the army under Sabuktagin, and being unable to withstand the specially severe winter, Jaipal asked for peace. Sabuktagin wished to grant it, but his son Malhmfid of Ghazni advised him not to do so. On hearing that his advances for peace have been refused, Jaipal wrote to Sabuktagin in the following terms. " Perhaps you do not know the custom of the Hindu warriors. When they have lost all hopes for their own lives, they cast all they possess in the fire, they blind the elephants, horses and buffaloes, they throw their women and children into</page><page sequence="9">PEACE AND WAR IN HINDU CULTURE 41 the flames, then they fight in such a manner that they themselves are killed. Now, that time has come. Should you grant us the peace that we desire, it will be a great kindness on your part; but if you do not, you will repent it." If this is indeed true, a more desolate picture can hardly be imagined; and the feelings of the conqueror may well be compared with those of Napoleon on his arrival in Moscow. Two of the great Hindu epics, the Ramayana and the Mahab- harata, are both full of the warlike deeds of their respective heroes. The former deals with the exploits of Rama, and especially with his wars against Ravana, the demon-king of Lafiki, the modern Ceylon. And the latter is in the main a glorification of the wars of the five Pandava brothers. An important festival of modern India is the Dasahard or Vijaya Dasami. Principally in the Rajput and Mahratta states Dadahard is a very special holiday. It commemorates the triumphal return march of Rama two days after he had killed Ravana. The prin- cipal object of worship on this day is the shami-tree, the Prosopis spigicera, because the Pandava brothers of old had once tied their arms to the branches of a specimen of this species. Among the Mahratta chiefs this day was considered the most auspicious day for starting on a military expedition, and many of the historical expeditions were started on the Vijaya, or success, day; and on this day young children are ceremoniously initiated into the intrica- cies of the alphabet. Another important institution for the proper understanding of Hindu society is the caste system. The Ayran Hindus, as we know, were divided into three main divisions: the Brthmans, or the priests or the law-givers, or rather what would be termed today the intelligentsia; the Ksattriyas, or the warriors; and the Vaisyas, or the husbandmen. As they are considered at the present day, the Brahmans occupy the highest position, but in my opinion it is an open question whether they have always enioyed this position. Several years ago, while writing on the origin of the caste system, I made a suggestion that the Ksattriyas alone could anthropologically be termed Aryans, and that they were probably regarded as higher than the Brthmans. Since my paper was published a gentleman from Ceylon has sent me several refer- ences from South Indian literature substantiating this hypothesis.</page><page sequence="10">42 PRIMITIVE MAN How far it is valid, it is too early yet to say. It suffices here to mention that as regards the actual status, little, if any, difference was made between a Brahman and a Ksattriya. The Ksattriya, as a caste, is almost extinct, and in certain parts of India it is totally extinct, but the veneration for heroes con- tinues, as a few examples will prove conclusively. I have already mentioned Rtma, the hero of the Ramayana. He is celebrated throughout India, from Ka'mir to Cape Comorin, from the Bay of Bengal to the Indian Ocean, as a model of all that is good, and as a celebrated hero. As a historical fact, he undoubtedly was one of the four sons of King Daiaratha of Oudh, of the so-called Solar race, and therefore a Ksattriya. After his death, Rama was apotheosized, and was converted into one of the most popular incarnations of Visnu. And to this day all living persons remark- able for great personal valour or strength are liable to be con- verted into gods at the least opportunity. Not very long ago a number of Hindus in the Punjab formed'themselves into a sect of Nikkal Sen worshippers. The explanation of this new sect is that General Nicholson was so admired for his bravery by his followers that they were determined to worship him, after first corrupting his name to the Hinduized form Nikkal Sen. The General endeavoured to put a stop to this absurdity by punishing them, but it only filled them with greater awe and clearly demon- strated what a mighty god this Nikkal Sen was. Another sect in Orissa worshipped Queen Victoria as its supreme divinity. I may give another example from Bengal, the most progressive and the best educated province in the whole of India. About 6o years ago a young and ambitious Bengali boy, having a bad attack of Wander- lust, left his native village, and after roaming over the continents of Europe and North America, finally joined the Argentinian army as a simple private. Through his bravery and courage he was later promoted to a Colonel. He settled down in the Argentine Republic, where he died only recently. Today the name of Col. Sures Biswas is a by-word on the lips of every Bengali man, woman and child. Had he lived a few years earlier, who knows, perhaps he too might have attained the dignity of being the chief god of the Biswas sect, or at least, the tutelary god of his native village. Two of the most famous women of India are Padmini and Laksmi Bai. They are famed not for their feminine qualities, but for</page><page sequence="11">PEACE AND WAR IN HINDU CULTURE 43 their heroism. The former, attended by her ladies-in-waiting, threw herself on a blazing pyre rather than live a life of disgrace when her husband lost the battle, and Laksmi Bai, the Rani of Jhansi, died at the head of her army in a field near Gwalior, where, dressed in male attire, she was fighting against the British under the command of Sir Hugh Rose. In this hasty sketch I think I have clearly demonstrated the militarism of the Maurya kings, but have passed over in silence the golden age of Indian history. This golden age was the Gupta dynasty which was founded by another Chandragupta who reigned only a short time till about A. D. 330. After his death, he was succeeded by his son Samudra-gupta, who reigned for about 40 or 50 years, and was one of the most remarkable as well the most accomplished kings recorded in Indian history. His first undertaking on ascending the throne was to subdue such princes in the Gangetic valley who did not acknowledge his authority. After successfully accomplishing this he brought the wild tribes under control, and then invaded the Deccan, and advanced so far south in the peninsula that he finally came into conflict with the Pallava ruler of Conjeeverum, near Madras. At the close of Samudra-gupta's reign, his empire was the greatest in India since the days of AMoka. His military achievements I need not comment upon any more here; they are too well known. Jayaswal writing in the latest Journal of the Behar and Orissa Research Society (xix, 1933, p. 204) says of Samudra-gupta that he did not overdo militarism, and that he was fully conscious of the value of a policy of peace, and that after his second campaign he never undertook any expedition, "but gained his object through diplomacy and peace by bringing the ShThanushThi, the Hill States, the Repub- lics, and the Colonies within the folds of his empire and the sphere of his imperial influence." Be that as it may, Samudra-gupta killed the free spirit of his country, he destroyed the Malavas and the Yaudheyas, who were the nursery of freedom. But on the other hand, under Samudra-gupta the Hindus became literary empire- builders outside of India. Kumarajiva made a literary conquest of China, and his translation of the Diamond Sutra became a national classic in Chinese literature, from which, according to Professor Giles, " Chinese poets and philosophers have drawn inspiration and instruction." The Kaundinya missionaries socially and cul-</page><page sequence="12">44 PRIMITIVE MAN turally conquered Cambodia, and left for posterity the magnificent temples of Angkor Vat; merchants and artists made India a won- derland for foreign eyes; and the aristocracy of intellect and ability was raised to such a standard as was hardly found again in the country. But yet the Hindus could not remember the name of Samudra-gupta with any feelings of gratitude, for he, like the other Guptas, was a tyrant to Hindu constitutional freedom; and hence, when Alberuni came to India, he was told that the Guptas were a wicked people, thus verifying the assertion of the immortal Shakespeare: "The evil that men do lives after them, The good is oft interred with their bones." But let us now be more charitable, and think that the Gupta period, in spite of its militarism, was yet the Golden Age of Hindu India; let us remember only the good deeds of Samudra-gupta and his successors, and forget the imperialism. In conclusion, may I remark that hero-worship has been known among all peoples, and at all periods. Whether as an ethnographer or as a Carlyle we find hero-worship everywhere; and it has always been a dominant trait in Hindu life. War has been glori- fied, and peace has been advocated only as a substitute, as a dip- lomatic measure to be cast away as soon- as convenient. From earliest times the Hindus have been adherents of armed force, rather than of peace and harmony. But with the introduction of Buddhism and of Jainism in India, cessation of hostility and the theory of fraternal love became the dominant theme, and thence- forth the people became divided into two factions, and the same conditions are seen in modern Indian politics. The followers of Gandhi, who himself is a Jain and an adherent of the principle of ahhihsa, are those who do not believe in violence as a means for the furtherance of their ideals, whereas the extremists, basing their arguments on what the Aryan Hindus preached and practiced, hold that violence and bloodshed will eventually bring about their deliverance as nothing else will. The tendency however, in modern India, backed up by the teachings of Gandhi, is towards pacifism and tolerance. Whether pacifism or militarism will prevail in the end, no one can say yet. But to me it seems, that as far as India is concerned, in any conflict between Brawn and</page><page sequence="13">45 Brain, the former will always be preferred, but if that be found insufficient, then Brain will become the second choice, or should I say " Hobson's choice." As long as we are weak and helpless we shall clamour for " Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite," but once we find ourselves in a position to do so, our motto will be: "De l'audace, encore de l'audace, et toujours de l'audace."</page></plain_text>
