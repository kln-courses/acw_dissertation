<plain_text><page sequence="1">Modern Theology and Aesthetic Education JOHN ADKINS RICHARDSON Rational men must be suspicious of historians who insist upon the nec- essary correspondence of all the elements of an age. The assumption that a Zeitgeist can accommodate all of the facts of life is clearly un- supportable if only because it is impossible for an historiography to take every fact into account. On the other hand, we can safely speak of the unity of an age in terms of a consensus of ends, purposes, or ideals. And more often than not the coincidences of purpose that override, but do not abolish, distinctions among fields of interest tell us far more about the time than the disharmonies which provoke conflict. I believe that such a coincidence of purpose is revealed in certain parallels be- tween the states of theology and art appreciation in the democratic world today. Coincidence does not preclude the play of differences and, indeed, differences do exist. But the similarities are more interesting because less expected. More importantly, they are of greater pertinence to the goals of aesthetic education. Modern art, by making technical considerations and formal problems the sine qua non of artistic experience, has produced coincidentally- or at least appears intimately associated with - a secondary transfor- mation of taste. I refer to the amazing and apparently insatiable public appetite for a perpetually varied artistic diet. W. McNeil Lowry once attributed this phenomenon to the growth of the college educated audi- ence and to the university art appreciation course which also gets a "strong share of the blame for the lack of discrimination visible in that audience."1 But this surely gives college faculties credit for far more JOHN ADKINS RICHARDSON is Associate Professor of Art and Design at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville.

The situation is as likely the reverse - a lack of discrimination produced the course. In any case, the audience, their discrimination or lack of it, the university pro- grams, and the art appreciation courses ultimately have a common cause in the expansion of the affluent class and in the vast increase of leisure time. It is not the size of the lay audience that is so striking but the rela- tive tolerance shown every kind of art by the intellectual and artistic communities. In view of current impatience with a priori rationalized systems of orderliness, it is remarkable that an art so dedicated to rou- tine as that of the Salon should be admired today in any undulation of the style. Yet, the highly specialized devices of the academy have been appropriated by a veritable army of moderns, including the notorious Salvador Dali and such American artists as Andrew Wyeth, Siegfried Reinhardt, and Edwin Dickinson. How strange it is, after all, to find the work of these academic symbolists displayed alongside the random eventualities of Abstract Impressionism, beside Lichtensteins and works by Richard Anuskiewicz, and these in a museum collection containing everything from friezes out of classical antiquity to Rococo provocations of the flesh and ceremonial implements from the shaded forests beneath the Sudan. Ours is an astonishing age; no other has exhibited such catholicity of taste or such breadth of interest. It is of little moment that aspects of this generosity are fatuous, that we sometimes seem incapable of dis- tinguishing the forms of ruthless utility (as presented in a display of athletic equipment) from the intrinsic values of a purely artistic object. The fact remains that we are at a time in history when it is possible for us to experience all the world's art in terms of the formal gestures of the various cultures and different states of mind. The space of mod- em art from its beginnings to the present, and, consequently, the result- ing conditions for the appreciation of all art, are symbolic of Western democracy. It can accommodate as many points of view as there have been artists and can elicit from spectators completely novel and per- sonal sensations. Andre Malraux's famous "museum without walls" could have appeared only in this environment. And the significance of that fact ought not be turned aside. Such a community of choices certainly should not be confounded with the recrudescence of a general indifference to quality. On the contrary, it affords the greatest field for the exercise of discernment. For that very reason it can be established as a pedagogical norm. It is</page><page sequence="3">MODERN THEOLOGY AND AESTHETIC EDUCATION 69 the rich diversity of the milieu that affirms the narrowness of the academy. Nonetheless, some think there is a negative polarity in the diffusion of taste which appears to many statesmen, critics, and art educators to hold such promise for liberal democracy. With diffusion there may have taken place a concomitant loss of density or intensity of feeling. Edgar Wind, at least, has argued that mere indifference is at the root of our undogmatic generosity: If a man has the time and the means, he can see a comprehensive Picasso show in London one day and the next a comprehensive Poussin exhibition in Paris, and - what is the most amazing thing of all - find himself exhilarated by both. When such large displays of incompatible artists are received with equal interest and appreciation it is clear that those who visit these exhibi- tions have acquired a strong immunity to them. Art is so well received be- cause it has lost its sting.2 So far as its logic goes, this argument leaves something to be desired. Wind has formed his conclusion from a consequence; that is, while it may be that men would behave in this fashion had they acquired an immunity to art, it is by no means certain that they behave this way because they have acquired such an immunity. But, all in all, ques- tioning the validity of his logic does not really detract from the per- suasiveness of his case. For it depends upon a conviction that far outreaches logic. But this is not the place to analyze the social foundations of Wind's asperity; let me mention only that his article has more in common with Matthew Arnold's Culture and Anarchy than just the similarity of the title "Art and Anarchy." Where Arnold set up cultivation as a pre- scription against that "strange disease of modem life," the worship of mere mechanics, Wind has contrasted the refined enchantments of a connoisseur's taste with the contemporary sophisticate's desultory sam- pling of techniques. His is a construction calculated to warm the hearts of many art historians who deplore "appreciationism" which, they feel, "deprives naivete of its charm without correcting its errors,"3 thereby accomplishing from an iconologist's point of view what, may I say, art history perpetrates upon an artist's. Obviously, whether one views the experiencing of art today as intense or parochial, indiscriminate or uncontracted, too concerned with glam- 2 Edgar Wind, "Art and Anarchy," The Listener and BBC Television Review, Vol. 44 (November 17, 1960), 882. 8 Erwin Panofsky, Meaning in the Visual Arts (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1955), p. 19.</page><page sequence="4">70 JOHN ADKINS RICHARDSON orous facades or freed of recondite nonessentials, depends rather ex- clusively upon the vantage point from which the experience is being seen. It is surely true that we are less than intolerant of casual inter- course with art. Nearly all of us permit students to touch the surfaces of great varieties of artistic experiences without becoming deeply in- volved in any. The one weakness to which we are no longer prone (as Dr. Wind is quick to recognize) is that of asserting the safe perpetuity of our own tastes. Thus, we reinforce the experiencing of art as a somewhat tentative preoccupation. Our open-mindedness should not perhaps be proclaimed with as much pride as some of us accept it. On the other hand, one must ask whether general indulgence really does reduce art to the level of an ordinary diversion or whether it represents, instead, a positive force in modern life. Much the same question has been addressed to the religious per- suasions that in Britain are called humanist and in this country liberal. Of these, too, it has been said that they make a fetish of simple open- mindedness.4 And, in fact, it would be hard to deny that many liberals look upon religious zeal as a kind of mental masturbation - disappoint- ing in private, indecent in public. These consumers of modern theolo- gies sometimes seem as indifferent to worship as Wind says the artistic audience is to the qualities of painting. Their decisions are never final. And, since everyone knows that provisional judgments can confer mod- esty upon smug indifference and cover the obtuse with appearances of discretion, it is not surprising that traditionalists react to "Christian atheism," for example, as a form of organized hypocrisy. The serious religious liberal would likely argue that conventional Christian worship is, for the most part, just a special instance of idol- atry. To be idolatrous, after all, one need not venerate a statue hewn of stone; a hand-me-down mental image of the Saviour will do as well as any icon for a fetish. For a fact, it will do better since in no literal sense can the biblical injunction against "graven images" be brought against it. Yet, no respectable theology could tolerate adulation of the grandfather figure of God retained by simple folk from their childhoods on. In Nietzsche that figure is made the cause of death to all the other deities. They laugh themselves to death when the ungodliest utterance came from a God himself- the utterance: "There is but one God! Thou shalt have no other Gods before me!" - An old grim-beard of a God, a jealous one, forgot himself in such wise:- 4 See, for example, Renford Bambrough, "Praising with Faint Damns," The Listener and BBC Television Review, Vol. 71 (February 13, 1964), 265-66.</page><page sequence="5">MODERN THEOLOGY AND AESTHETIC EDUCATION 71 And all the Gods then laughed and shook upon their thrones and exclaimed: "Is it not just divinity that there are Gods, but no God?" He that hath an ear let him hear. And God himself expired from an excess of sentiment: Thus spake the devil unto me, once on a time: "Even God hath his hell: it is his love for man." And lately did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity for man hath God died." - Of course, the new theologians are not concerned with anything so hackneyed as ridding religion of anthropomorphic caricatures of the divine. The God whose death they have proclaimed is the very concept of a divine force that rules the universe. In effect, Thomas J. J. Altizer, Paul Van Buren, and Harvey Cox reject divinity itself except as a kind of poetic metaphor. What these radicals have in common with one another, and with older liberals such as Tillich and Bonhoeffer, is their insistence upon the seriousness of mankind's search for the transcendent. As regards the search itself, they are far more skeptical than their forbears, the Deists, ever were -not only of the pertinence of the Creator to the living, but also of what, for a Deist, was truly divine - human reason. The new searchers after truth will grant no status to rationalized, priv- ileged finalities that cannot be called into question. What is pertinent is conditional. Final judgments are not congenial to their devotions. The moder form of hubris is nothing more arrogant than simple certitude; the worst sin one could commit would be to have absolute confidence in error. Nothing we know warrants such unqualified faith. Neither the Christian, Jew, nor humanist should assume any single atti- tude towards the world as a whole, because there seems always to be some ignored feature of existence that makes the assumed posture un- tenable. Thus, the principal revelations that concern the theologians of this generation are not of absolutes but, instead, are recognitions unfolded in the perennial contest between men and actuality. Their God is no deus ex machina; you cannot call Him in to save you from defeat, you cannot bribe Him with good works nor mollify Him by prayer. He is not even "out there." If He is anywhere, it is within the center of being. The purpose of religion is to reveal the intimacy be- tween the soul and God, that is, between the ego and what Tillich calls 5Friedrich Nietzsche, Thus Spake Zarathustra. Trans. Thomas Common (New York, n.d.), p. 190. 6Ibid., p. 102.</page><page sequence="6">72 JOHN ADKINS RICHARDSON the "universal ground of existence." Even so orthodox an Anglican as Bishop John Robinson maintains that the final test of worship is how sensitive it makes men to the sacredness of secular things.7 Attentiveness to areas of spiritual risk has always seemed necessary for anything like redemption to occur; that is even more the case in a place so unlike Augustine's City of God as the world we inhabit. In Cox's The Secular City, God is encountered only at the edge of mighty events; He is the true avant-garde of history. For other theologians the important crises are subjective ones, existential in the sense that Kierke- gaard and Karl Barth must have meant. But in whatever wise they differ, the new approaches to religion unite in seeing a higher fidelity to God expressed in the tragic search for Him than in obsequiousness to any form that has been, or ever shall be, attributed to Him. As Camus said of Sisyphus, condemned to roll a giant stone ceaselessly up a mountainside, "The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart."8 For the outworkings of Man's existence by private individuals contains all the suffering and every bit of grace that cov- ered Christ on Calvary. This excursus seems, perhaps, to have taken us far from the subject of the status of art in modem life. But the analogy between today's art public and the followers of a liberal theology is far from inexact. For in defense of contemporary art experience much the same sort of things can be said that are used to justify the modern religious positions. Since it was not always so, the very fact that it now is tells us a good deal about our present situation. Consider the remarkable capacities of the great moderns for stylistic invention. Owing to their versatility, Picasso, Braque, Ernst, and Matisse, among others, have given an altogether special meaning to the idea of style in painting. For them a style was not taken up as a sort of costume identifying one painting with others, nor was it invented solely to mark out one's independence. To attain a style was part of a continuous process - a process of eliciting from the self constantly new attitudes towards art and life, and of disclosing novel relationships of the personality in kinship with artistry. Having invented some new mode, they considered it only the manifestation of a temporary imme- diate role. For the twentieth-century painter and sculptor the process of form creation had itself become inviting as a practice. And it may See John A. T. Robinson, Honest to God (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1963), p. 90.

More often than not the search for novelty among the recipients of today's art reveals an attitude precisely like that of the religious liberal who tries perpetually to elicit from himself new and vital responses to reality. For both the aesthete and the liberal the process of search is aligned with a fear of losing oneself in habituated patterns of experi- ence and "getting in a rut." The yearning is for self-fulfillment. That yearning has, in our time, become epidemic in its proportions. It is constantly invoked by advertising and by the popular media of com- merce. But the same invocations, wearing a more sober mien, are en- countered everywhere among the intelligentsia. In the United States, psychoanalysis has become an almost conventionalized ritual for them, the ordinary route to realization of the self's potential. Naive extremes of the search for self-fulfillment extend from the synthetic mysticism induced by hallucinating drugs to the sophomoric "objectivism" of Ayn Rand's followers. Wherever thought is taken at all seriously, wherever individual will prevails against arbitrary regulation, wherever ethical questions are paramount, the advocates of turning toward the self in search of pur- pose will be heard. There is at least a little evidence that white students demonstrating for civil rights causes believe that they are inspired to act more from a need to fulfill themselves than from devotion to ex- ternal ideals of liberty and justice.9 And, during the relatively con- servative "Eisenhower years," the Commission on National Goals went so far as to proclaim the search for individual self-fulfillment as the supreme objective of American society. The search may be considered futile and the goal ersatz,10 but there is no doubting the prevalence of self-realization as a social ideal. It would be very odd, too, to suppose that when something extends into every other corer of our public and private existences, the fine arts alone should escape its influences. Among those who take art seriously, only a very few can any longer respond to it in terms of fixed standards of decorum. For many, if not most, patronage has become a truly Sisyphean work in which the objec- tive is an ephemera and its pursuit an unending pilgrimage. Since the latter part of the nineteenth century artists have been working towards the establishment of qualities which are meaningless to the viewer un- 9 See the lead editorial in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch (January 15, 1965), 2B. 10 For a cogent argument to this effect as well as a refreshingly learned treat- ment of public education, see Solon T. Kimball and James E. McClellan, Edu- cation and the New America (New York: Random House, 1962).</page><page sequence="8">74 JOHN ADKINS RICHARDSON less he achieves the proper attitude. To Van Gogh and Cezanne, for example, the notion of transmitting a completely defined message was anathematic.ll They, and the host of men who have followed their leads, make the experiencing of a painting or a sculpture a part of its creation. That is to say, they emphasize in their work what has been apparent from the first - that a good deal of meaning is invested in the eye of the beholder. It is surely no accident that the foundations of projective psychology were laid during the last decades of the nine- teenth centuryl2 and that the widespread use of such techniques as Rorschach's and the TAT (Thematic Apperception Test) has been matched by an increasing tendency on the part of creative people in all of the arts to accord to viewers an ever greater role in giving mean- ing to their works. To an extent hitherto unknown the conditions of sensibility for the producer of art coincide with those of its consumer. The specific pas- sion of the artists for liberation from convention and from prescriptive canons and rules corresponds to a poignant longing for personal dis- tinctiveness that is general among their audience. The joys of self- expression experienced by the artist are matched by the viewer's thrill- ing discovery of new branches in the streams of his own consciousness. The central difficulty of such an aesthetic union is, of course, that unusual resources are required on both parts to maintain a passionate reverence for artistry sub species artis. Few men are capable of continu- ing seriously a search for an object which is, by definition, fugitive. Still, that fact is no more devastating to the moderns' position than the fact that among Christians the superstitiously pious outnumber the devout, which, incidentally, is an argument against the theology of the Roman Church. It is to be expected that the mediocre will invariably outnumber the gifted, in the realm of spiritual worthiness as well as in the life of the mind. The new mode of absorbing art is not, certainly, restricted to contemporary works. It is possible to discover oneself in paintings by Cranach or Bellini, just as one is apt to see personal rele- vance in lines from Shakespeare, Swift, or Sterne. Just ten years ago Meyer Schapiro wrote of the painting and sculp- ture of the fifties: But if painting and sculpture do not communicate they induce an attitude " See John Adkins Richardson, "Solitude, Modernity, and Art Education," School Arts, Vol. 63 (September 1963), 34-37. 12 Leopold Bellak, "On the Problems of the Concept of Projection," in Law- rence Edwin Abt and Leopold Bellak (eds.), Projective Psychology (New York: Alfred Knopf, 1959), p. 8.</page><page sequence="9">MODERN THEOLOGY AND AESTHETIC EDUCATION 75 of communion and contemplation. They offer to many an equivalent of what is regarded as part of religious life: a sincere and humble submission to a spiritual object, an experience which is not given automatically, but requires preparation and purity of spirit. It is primarily in modern painting and sculpture that such contemplativeness and communion with the work of another human being, the sensing of another's perfected feeling and imagi- nation, becomes possible.' Without the slightest revision this statement describes, not only the art work of that time, but, equally well, the context in which all art presents itself to us today. Edgar Wind was quite mistaken. Con- temporary habitues of galleries and museums are not jaded degenerates who seek out ever more titillating experiences because their sensibilities have been coarsened by novelty and misuse. On the contrary, they have a special capacity for shifting their points of view to coincide with artistic intentions. They are no less sensitive to the embodiments of artistry than people were before; they are simply more alert to the reverberations sounded in their own souls by what is awesome or sub- lime in art. The major hazard connected with exposure to art appreciation courses is not that their superficiality will turn a student's brain to gruel; it is that the exposure to specific works of art will be subsumed beneath a great white tombstone labeled "Significant Form" or "Ico- nography" or "Social History" or some other special idiom of the ar- tists, historians, and art educators who staff the faculties of our colleges and universities. Such impositions tend to destroy the ideal of self- reliant criticism which is indispensible to contemporary culture. What should be conveyed is something of the sheer prolificacy of different styles of vision, their forms and their significances. That, at any rate, would seem to be the minimum prerequisite for bringing the courses into consonance with the existing circumstance. In any such enterprise theories of art will inevitably have a place, either by implication or through explications of styles. But, as Morris Weitz has said, "to un- derstand the role of aesthetic theory is not to conceive it as definition, logically doomed to failure, but to read it as summaries of seriously made recommendations to attend in certain ways to certain features of art."'4 I, at least, comprehend no alternative direction; none other seems to take account of both the variety of styles and the myriad self- conscious selves that constitute the present audience for serious art. 18 Meyer Schapiro, "The Liberating Quality of Avant-Garde Art," Art News, Vol. 56 (Summer 1957), 41. 14 Morris Weitz, "The Role of Theory in Aesthetics," in Morris Weitz (ed.), Problems in Aesthetics (New York: Macmillan, 1959), p. 156.</page><page sequence="10">76 JOHN ADKINS RICHARDSON Mid-twentieth-century man's awareness of the self appears at times to amount to a cultural abnormality. But that awareness is, perhaps, the personal tariff our civilization demands, as anxiety over death paid for Egypt's and fear of some terrible retribution for the Medieval period. With the universe in which we live we are given an appropriate sense of purpose. And the purposes are always of the present and never those of the past or future. The past has gone by; posterity will have its own conceits and will make use of the past to justify them; the present has only its hopes and uses its art as a token fulfillment of them. Were the justifiably great reputations of men like Wind and Panofsky (or Roger Fry and John Dewey) to cause us to impose upon young people standards that are alien to the interests of this time, it would turn art appreciation - at worst an occasion of farce - into an au- thentic tragedy. Not that there is any chance of that occurring; self- interest impels us too strongly in the direction of modernity. When all of this is cast in terms of what is actually happening in education one appreciates the inexorability of the forces pushing us to include in art appreciation the concepts of struggle, search, and self- discovery. Someone has said that we can no longer teach students everything about a subject; there is just too much to learn. But we can teach them what a subject is all about. Marshall McLuhan's provoca- tive enunciation of the principle that "the medium is the message" is rather belated. Those in science education have known for decades that real understanding of mathematics depends upon a grasp of its foundational logic, upon apprehension of its axiomatic formal struc- ture; in other words, it depends upon a sense for mathematics as a medium. Structural linguistics is nothing more than the appearance of the same concern with process in the study of spoken and written lan- guage. And this paper explores process-orientation in art appreciation and in religious thought. What we have here is not merely a concern with formalism per se; what is coming into clearer focus is the relationship of epistemology to schooling. In the past, educators so emphasized psychology that they obscured the role in education of modes of cognition fitting to partic- ular fields. In other words, theories of knowledge went begging; learn- ing theories ruled the day. Now that slight is about to be redressed. The times themselves require it. Not everything that emerges from the dynamics of the new age will be so universally respected as what is called "new math." Some of it will be accused, as Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dic-</page><page sequence="11">MODERN THEOLOGY AND AESTHETIC EDUCATION 77 tionary - a work committed to structural linguistic's criteria of "usage" - has been accused, of being vernacular, slovenly, and heretical. Those who fail to take a prescriptive view of human knowledge and behavior are always guilty of heresy in someone's eyes. But we would do well to remember that what Camus said is true: "Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well.... One must imagine Sisyphus happy."'5 15 Camus, loc. cit.</page></plain_text>
