One and a half years after its first appearance Professor Jaeger's Paideia I has come out in a second edition. In a short preface to the new edition the author tells us that it is substantially unaltered, except that some slips have been corrected. There has been, he says, some discussion of the con- ception of historical knowledge involved in the work, and he briefly asserts his belief that this conception, although it cannot supplant history in the traditional sense, has a necessary and valuable place. The body of the book is just four lines shorter than the first edition, and the difference is due to the omission of a single sentence that may be freely translated thus: "The aim of the modern leaderstate (Fiihrerstaat) must be to find this new path between the leadership of Pericles, which was based on democracy, and the monarchy of Dionysius, which rested purely on military support." RICHARD ROBINSON CORNELL UNIVERSITY Proceedings of the American Catholic Philosophical Association: Philo- sophy of the Sciences. Issued by the Secretary of the Association, Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C., I935. PP. iv, 220. Dominated by the concepts and spirit of "the Great Tradition"-Scholastic Philosophy-this volume contains formal and highly technical papers that explore the- fields of chemistry, physics, biology, and psychology, together with accounts of round-table discussions of certain questions in metaphysics, social ethics, epistemology, and aesthetics. Thoughtful readers will find that the Catholic Church is no enemy of science, but the mortal foe of "false" philosophy behind science. Philosophers cannot fail to take keen interest in any determined assault upon an ancient and inescapable task of philosophy -the examination of the assumptions of sciences and the reconciliation of science with religion. NORBORNE H. CROWELL POTSDAM, NEW YORK L'ecole mystique de Lyon, i776-i847. Par JOSEPH BUCHE. Paris, Felix Alcan, I935. PP. xiv, 306. This book is an intriguing study of one of the lesser reactions produced by eighteenth-century thought. It expresses the growth of a mysticism de- tached from traditional religious and theological foundations. This illumi- nisme, arising as the Encyclopedia, destroyed traditional faith, took the form of what may be called "primitivism"-an effort to re-establish in the self, and in this life, "the primitive Adam, who, before the Fall, was almost a god, or at least a collaborator of God". M. Buche traces the introduction of Illuminism into Lyons to the letters of Claude de St. Martin to Jean- Baptiste Willermoz.

BALZ THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Eine synthetische Studie uiber den Menschen. Von ALBERT GOEDECKEMEYER. Halle (Saale), Max Niemeyer, I935. Pp. ii, 2II-252, inc. We have here a composite picture of the contributions of the various fields of knowledge regarding the nature of man. The excellence of the study is, however, distorted by the author's dogmatic assertion that any non-naturalistic account of man must be irrelevant and invalid. A truly synthetic study of man would have to integrate the findings of both the naturalistic and spiritualistic interpretations. Positivism gains nothing in certainty in the end by merely dropping the spiritualistic interpretation of human nature. HERMAN HAUSHEER LAMONI, IOWA Der Staat, seine geistigen Grundlagen, seine Entstehung und Entzuicklung. Von KURT SCHILLING. Miinchen, Ernst Reinhardt, 1935. Pp. 324. This book offers a philosophical interpretation of the nature of the state. For the author a philosophical approach to the state differs from an em- pirical, institutional approach in that it is an attempt at "unconditional understanding" on the basis of "ultimate presuppositions" drawn from der Tiefe der Sache selber. It turns out that what the author means is that the only way the state can be understood is by showing how it expresses the race, nationality, and consciousness of the community. These latter concepts are not taken as historical categories but as normative; even the "existence of a people" is not an historical fact but a result of the way in which the "tasks" of a people are conceived. In the development of his theme the author makes use of the customary Hegelian distinction between the natu- ral and rational will to prove that the actions of the state are a fulfillment of the real will of the individual. The upshot is a modified form of totali- tarianism. The life of the individual must consist in "sacrifice, devotion, and work" for the community. The state must provide its citizens not so much with opportunities for happiness and welfare but with occasions for sacrifice. It is admitted that other states besides Germany have a right to exist provided their people follow their own genius. The church is to be tolerated so long as it eschews all political affairs and restricts itself to mediating the relations between the individual soul and the unconditioned. SIDNEY HOOK WASHINGTON SQUARE COLLEGE NEW YORK UNIVERSITY The Supreme Law. By MAURICE MAETERLINCK. Translated by K. S. SHEL- VANKAR. New York, E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., I935. PP. i64. The distinguished author of this book challenges the advocates of rela- tivity in physics, and defends the Newtonian point of view, on the ground that Einsteinian cosmology is largely unintelligible; "it is not yet known</page><page sequence="3">No. 3.] DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES 339 how far the equations of Einstein and his followers correspond to reality, and it has not been at all demonstrated . .. that gravitation is a geometrical property of the universe . . . [for] nearly everything depends on calculations which are not necessarily founded on observation." Gravitation, the author holds, can best be regarded as a manifestation of the divine "will of the universe", an internal energy, or law, governing an eternal process of evo- lution. H. R. SMART CORNELL UNIVERSITY Zur Kritik des logischen Transzendentalismus. Von ARNOLD WILMSEN. Paderborn, Ferdinand Schoningh, I935. Pp. Xii, 249. Wilmsen here offers a searching analysis of the relation between the act of judgment and the so-called timeless, ideal, logical meaning of the judg- ment. Proceeding from a careful critique of Bolzano's famous "Satz an sich" in this connection, Wilmsen subjects to a devastating critique not only Bolzano's own transcendental logic but that of the whole movement of Neo-Kantianism as well. This leads him finally to a detailed analysis and critique of Kant's own logical transcendentalism and, in terms of that critique, to the conclusion that both Kant's theory of judgment and of awareness and also his theory of validity and of value rest "upon founda- tions which in no sense offer the necessary support" for any logical transcendentalism. In fact, no such support is shown to be possible. The book is an important contribution which deserves wide and careful study by philosophers. PAUL ARTHUR SCHILPP NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY The Genossenschaft-theory of Otto von Gierke. By JOHN D. LEWIS. Uni- versity of Wisconsin Studies in the Social Science and History, No. 25. Madison, I935. PP. i86. This study is, in the main, an exposition of Gierke's theory of the cor- poration, to which is added about seventy-five pages of translation from his works. The main conclusions advanced are that Gierke belonged historically in the Hegelian tradition, that his theory applied chiefly to private law, and that the political implications drawn by Preuss and the English students of Maitland were never envisaged by Gierke. This is excellent so far as it goes; but it is unfortunate that the author did not give his criticism freer rein. Gierke's erudition makes criticism difficult, but more might have been made of the suggestion that Gierke's history-like Hegelian history generally- often depended for its conclusions on the vague and rather mystical as- sumptions that preceded the investigation.

SABINE CORNELL UNIVERSITY Objektivitdt, voraussetzungslose Wissenschaft und wissenschaftliche Wahr- heit. Von FRIEDRICH WEIDAUER. Leipzig, S. Hirzel, I935. Pp. 40. The ambitious title of these pages raises hopes which the contents do not justify. Some of his major conclusions are the following. "The truth of a judgment means: agreement of the judgment with the 'fact' [judged], with the object of knowledge." This conception he calls "the absolutely indis- pensable concept of truth" and he claims here to have proved its "objective validity" as "real evidence". "Scientific truth", he tells us, is essentially characterized by "(I) being 'eternal' truth which is (2) inter-personally valid, possesses (3) permanent value, and has (4) a position, a logical place in a factually grounded system of truths, which express a permanent value". Value-judgments, moreover, may be "scientific" in the same sense and, in that case, they contain no additional "essential" characteristics. These quotations must suffice to show the superficiality of the whole treatment. The book is disappointing, to put it mildly. PAUL ARTHUR SCHILPP NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY Der Weg Aufwdirts: Ein Buch iiber Religion und Weltanschauung. Von WOLFGANG GR6BNER. Wien-Leipzig, Wilhelm Braumfiller, I935. PP. Vi, 254. Der Weg Aufdrts consists in ascribing value to life. Since values consti- tute man's inmost nature, we need to cultivate the inner life in order to make the present life more desirable. Speculation about a reality different from sense-perception is frowned upon because we know only the phenom- enal world; our efforts should, therefore, be directed toward improving the status of our earthly existence. But this does not mean that the author denies immortality and God. He believes in both; they are, however, things about which he cannot philosophize. He says, "fiber Gott philosophiere ich nicht-zu Gott bete ich." ADAM ALLES ST. JOHN'S COLLEGE ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND Meister Eckharts Ethik. Mit einem Vorwort von OTTO KARRER. Von HERMA PIESCH. Luzern, Vita Nova Verlag, 1935. Pp. xvi, I84. Meister Eckhart's goal is union with our Maker who embodied (in Neo- Platonic sense) his likeness in us. As creatures of God it is our duty to remove the debris that hides this divine image and to display it in its full glory. We can achieve this by forsaking sin, which separates from God, and by turning in prayer and meditation through Christ to God. A new birth will result, which will enable God's life to flow freely and fully in us; our lives will then issue in helpful acts toward others. ADAM ALLES ST. JOHN'S COLLEGE ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND</page><page sequence="5">No. 3.] DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES 34I Maimonides. Eine Biographie. Von ABRAHAM HESCHEL. Berlin, Erich Reiss, 1935. Pp. x, 288. This biography of the great medieval Jewish thinker, Maimonides, tells in a scholarly and charming manner the story not only of his life but also of his salient ideas in their appearance and growth. Of particular interest and importance is the author's emphasis on prophecy or inspiration not only as occupying a prominent place in Maimonidean thought but also as being the personal aspiration of Maimonides, who, seeing the apparent purpose- lessness and causelessness of individual variation, early recognized the limi- tation of the unaided intellect seeking knowledge. It is from the contem- plation of the individual that a thin stream of mysticism flowed into Mai- monidean rationalism. ISRAEL EFROS UNIVERSITY OF BUFFALO Faith and Reason. The Conflict over the Rationalism of Maimonides. By JOSEPH SARACHEK. Williamsport, the Bayard Press, I935. Pp. XiV, 290. The author traces the four successive storms of controversy that raged around Maimonides: the first, during his lifetime; the second, in i232-' I235, which led to the burning of his philosophical works; the third, at the end of the thirteenth century, in which German mysticism or Cabbalah opened fire; and the fourth, in I303-I306, which assumed the general cha- racter of philosophy versus religious education. Among the twenty-five points of attack enumerated by the author are Maimonides' rationalistic inter- pretation of the Bible, his anti-anthropomorphic conception of God, his view of the soul as a perishable faculty with only the "acquired intellect" surviv- ing, and his affirmation of the immutability of the laws of nature. ISRAEL EFROS UNIVERSITY OF BUFFALO The Ethics of- the Cambridge Platonists. By EUGENE M. AUSTIN. Phila-. delphia, I935. Pp. 86. This study is an attempt to deal with a movement which history has con- demned to undeserved obscurity. Rightly holding that the dominant theme of the Cambridge Platonists was the union of ethics and religion, the author finds the contributory background of the school in the thought of Plato, Plotinus, Descartes, and Hobbes, and points out the negligible effect which the political and religious unrest of the time had on the School. The major part of the study considers the pronouncements of the various thinkers on the chief ethical problems of the day, viz., the status of moral distinctions, and of the rational principle in ethics, the relation of ethics and religion, and the application of moral doctrines. The concluding chapter traces the influence of the movement upon subsequent ethical views. WILLIAM H. REITHER THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSiTY Aristotle's Theory of the Infinite. By ABRAHAM EDEL. New York, Privately printed, I934. PP. ii, I02. Dr. Edel's fundamental assumption is that Aristotle's approach to the problem of the infinite is an empirical one. Because the assumption of an</page><page sequence="6">342 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. actual infinite contradicts the facts of experience, that conception must be rejected. Dr. Edel then examines the contexts in which Aristotle makes use of the term infinite. The result of this examination shows that for Aristotle the infinite is a potentiality which can never be completely actualized. "The potential existence of the statue in the bronze is actualized when the move- ment of the sculptor is finished. But one day, the Olympic games, the gene- rations of men, the divisions of magnitudes, have no completion as such" (47). Thus infinity, according to Dr. Edel, has reference to a process, which process, though actualized, does not exhaust the whole in which it occurs. When this interpretation of the infinite is now applied to the world, the question whether the world is finite or infinite resolves itself into the answer that it is finite-infinite. The work, in spite of the many misprints and diffi- culties of expression, is an excellent illustration of Aristotle's "fresh starts". While Dr. Edel overemphasizes Aristotle's empiricism, this emphasis is a good antidote for those for whom Aristotle was the deductive philosopher. ALEXANDER LITMAN NEW YORK CITY The Essence of Plotinus. Extracts from the Six Enneads and Porphyry's Life of Plotinus, based on the Translation by STEPHEN MACKENNA. Compiled by GRAcE H. TURNBULL. New York, Oxford University Press, I934. Pp. xx, 304. In arranging this collection of extracts from the Six Enneads of Plotinus, Miss Turnbull was guided by a single thought, namely, to show that Plotinus possesses, even today, a moral and spiritual force. This interest led her to eliminate the more complicated dialectical portions of the Enneads and, in some cases, to substitute more familiar terms for the technical terms found in the original work. This type of popularization entails difficulties. But in view of the fact that these selections are addressed to the general reader rather than the technical scholar, it is unnecessary to criticize such modifications. The reader will be grateful to Miss Turnbull for the Ap- pendix wherein she shows the sources from which Plotinus drew and his influence on various figures in the history of thought. ALEXANDER LITMAN NEW YORK CITY Dictionnaire de spirituality. Fascicule V. Paris, Gabriel Beauchesne et ses fils, I935. PP. I282-i600. The fifth volume of the Dictionnaire de spiritualite', devoted principally to mysticism and asceticism, covers subjects, Basile (saint) to Bibliotheiques. Two of the longest articles and the two which are likely to be most significant for the readers of this Review are the article on Saint Bernard by Anselme Le Bail, and the one on Beghards and Beguines by F. Vernet and J. Van Mierlo. The latter writer has a valuable section on the origin and history of the words "Beghard" and "Beguine". The two articles to- gether on the history of these religious movements (they can hardly be called "sects") furnish the best available account. RUFUS M.

Henriette Hertz Trust of the British Academy. From the Proceed- ings of the British Academy, Vol. XXI. London, Humphrey Milford, I935. PP. I9. In these few pages Professor Gilson writes with that thorough com- petence, clarity, and simplicity, which mark his genius in the field of mediaeval philosophy. He first compares the menace of the Moslem armies in the eighth century, which Charles Martel overcame at Poitiers, with the greater menace to the civilization of Europe from the invasion of Arabian philosophy in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, which Saint Thomas repulsed by his vigorous thought and his fearless pen. He then proceeds to analyse the nature of the attack which the followers of Aver- roes and Avicenna launched against the traditional thought of Christendom and to explain Saint Thomas's defense of the dignity of the human person and the freedom of the individual man against Mohammedan fatalism and neo-platonic necessity, which had distorted the philosophy of Aristotle and infected even the thought of Christian theologians. St. Thomas laid the philosophical foundations of an authentic humanism. "Assuredly", Gilson concludes, "the man who first stated in their fullness those ever timely principles was more than a master mind; he was, and still remains, the master whose proper mission is to uphold among us, against all adverse forces, the supremacy of the mind."

This volume contains a collection of essays on the philosophical and theological teachings of Cajetan, of which Professor Oddone's study of the "Analogia Nominum", Professor Pirotta's essay (in Latin) on Cajetan's teaching regarding the desire of beatitude, Professor Daffara's article on Cajetan, the Commentator of Saint Thomas, and the Bibliography of Cajetan compiled by Tommaso Bozza, Librarian of the Royal Library of Brera will, no doubt, be of greatest interest to the readers of the Philosophical Review. GERALD B. PHELAN INSTITUTE OF MEDIAEVAL STUDIES TORONTO Intellectual Realism and Culture Change. By JAMES W. WOODARD. Han- over, The Sociological Press, I935. PP. vi, i98. The author's central thesis is that (I) the pristine tendency of the mind is toward intellectual realism, but that (2) there is a constant process of correction and refinement going on which leads in the direction of "reality- contactedness". The attempt is made to show the universality of hypostati- zation or reification as a characteristic of the thinking organism by an appeal to the data of child psychology (Piaget), abnormal psychology,</page><page sequence="8">344 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VoL. XLVI. cultural anthropology, and culture history. But while ethnocentrism, super- stition, dogmatism, and political absolutism, still linger with us because of the reifying tendency and the persistence of old reifications, Woodard feels that the rise of inductive methods of thought is leading us toward a new type of society. He prophesies that in the emerging social order there will be a larger proportion of sophisticated and cosmopolitan personalities, more highly individuated and yet, paradoxically, with a stronger group morale and a "collectivistic economy". The task the author has set himself is an ambitious one. He makes affirmations both concerning the nature of mind and the trend of civiliza- tion that are sweeping in nature. The marshalling of evidence to show the cultural universality of reification is impressive but the extrapolation from past cultural trends seems not quite to justify the optimistic predictions for the near cultural future. As to the claim that man has a sort of reifying instinct, the arguments, while cogently presented, are not entirely conclu- sive; the concept of reification needs more psychological and epistemological analysis than it receives. On the whole, however, the book is much more valuable than these critical comments indicate. It contains many original insights and presents an interesting new synthesis of sociological, psycho- logical, and philosophical subject-matter. Unfortunately, the presentation is often not clearly organized, the argument is hard to follow, and the style is frequently awkward and verbose. J. L. WOODWARD CORNELL UNIVERSITY Political Ethics. An application of Ethical Principles to Political Relations. By DANIEL SOMMER ROBINSON. New York, Thomas Y. Crowell Com- pany, I935. Pp. XViii, 288. This is a very elementary treatment of the subject of political ethics. The plan of the book is constructive rather than historical, dealing with such subjects as the origin of the state, the nature of the ideal state, the comparison of empirical states with the ideal, ethics and the problems of international relations, and practical suggestions for various types of re- form. The point of view at the first is of the nature of idealism, but the conclusion seems to be a fairly optimistic apology for the ethical principles inherent in representative democracies as against the evils of soviet and fascist dictatorships. HOWARD B. JEFFERSON COLGATE UNIVERSITY Religion, superstition et criminality. Par MAURICE DUVAL. Paris, Felix Al- can, I935. PP. 382. Man, far from being naturally good, is accursed with a radical evil, a native and ineradicable streak of cruelty. There is no rational or senti- mental ideal, no dream, no hope, no certain, but may become the main- spring of some persecuting mania. Men torture and plague one another best of all when they feel themselves inspired by some lofty ideal such as the love of God, of truth, or of justice. In an attempt to account for these facts the author plunges into involved discussions of primitive mentality,</page><page sequence="9">No. 3.] DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES 345 the differences between genuine religion and what he calls superstition, and so on, but the end leaves the reader with but little additional enlighten- ment, if any. Like most discussions of evil, this one produces little effect ex- cept the sense of its own essential futility-an involuntary confirmation of the author's own rejection of optimism, the philosophy of "voluntary hallu- cination". The style is, however, worthy of some praise-the early part in particular being couched in a lofty and beautiful language that more than once reminds the reader of the prince of all pessimists. SVEN NILSON HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT L'individu dans le desiquilibre moderne. Par ROGER MUNSCH. Paris, Felix Alcan, I935. Pp. 238. The two main causes of trouble today are seen by M. Munsch as material insecurity and moral turmoil. A single remedy suffices for both, namely a return to the synthetic point of view as over against the disintegrative analysis of science. More explicitly, it is a return to religion, reliance upon the past, and clear ideas of the natural laws governing duty, love, patriotism, etc. The essential though difficult task is to raise the level of the masses in these respects. For the masses increasingly insist upon self-rule. And merely to acquiesce and accept the modern panaceas which seek to adapt government to the existing level of the masses would but lead in the end to fresh disaster. L. M. PAPE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO Realisme et serenite. Par PIERRE LHOSTE-LACHAUME. Paris, Felix Alcan, 1936. Pp. vi, 4I2. The old is still good. The new in the case of scientific method has al- ready proved its error. As for socialism, with its guarantee of regimenta- tion, it is clearly unnatural. The same is true of internationalism. In contrast, the individualism of capitalism and nationalism consist with the natural order of things. Of course some friction accompanies the diversity of indi- vidualism. But this can be salved by religion. Such is Lhoste's reaffirmation. L. M. PAPE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO Die Renaissance. Von HEINRICH SCHALLER. Mfinchen, Ernst Reinhardt, I935. PP. I92. Die Welt des Barock. Von HEINRICH SCHALLER. Mfinchen, Ernst Rein- hardt, i936. Pp. 8o. Though evidently based upon impressive scholarship, Herr Schaller's book on the Renaissance is merely a summary of the various aspects and a few figures of this period, with stress upon the German contribution, especially that of the German mystics. The same author's even more cursory survey of Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries exhibits the Baroque quality in every field of culture. By "Baroque" he means "that peculiar heightening of expression which has been called pathetic, affected, and mannered, and which includes the sensualizing of the super-sensuous</page><page sequence="10">346 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVI. as well as the opposition of the sensuous to the non-sensuous". The pan- vitalistic outlook of the Renaissance is shown to pass by way of the Baroque to the mechanistic-dualistic, deistic view of the Enlightenment. In the first of these books the author sympathized with Vanini, Bruno, and Campanella, as victims of tyranny. In the second he regards the idea of tolerance as the most important result of the Enlightenment, but adds that intolerance is not simply immoral. Religious intolerance not seldom springs from zealous faith and "political intolerance is often concerned to avoid a greater evil for the sake of peace and order". VAN METER AMES UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI An Augustine Synthesis. By ERICEa PRZYWARA. New York, Sheed and Ward, I936. Pp. xvi, 496. It is decidedly unfortunate that Przywara apparently felt obliged to devote by far the larger part of this book to theological and hortatory selections. This fact is likely to limit the circulation of the volume, and to decrease its philosophic value. The editor's familiarity with Augustine, as revealed in previously published authoritative discussions, would lead one to expect a selection and order philosophically determined. Thus, for exam- ple, the passages from the De Trinitate could have been selected to il- luminate Augustine's theory of knowledge; those taken, however, are almost entirely directed towards exhortation. Nevertheless, although the con- stant theological flavor is distasteful to the modern mind, and the vivid metaphorical style not conducive to the clearest exposition, the attentive reader will perceive something of the range and power of Augustine's intellect. The preface by C. C. Martindale is somewhat too exuberant to be significant. J. R. CRESSWELL WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY Descartes: Correspondence. Publiee avec une introduction et des notes par CE[.
