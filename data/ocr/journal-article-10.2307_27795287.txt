<plain_text><page sequence="1">ISLAM IN A HUMANISTIC EDUCATION G. E. Von Grunebaum A humanistic education guides the individual through self-cognition to right action. Self-cognition is contingent on a realization of the individual's position in the world, metaphysical and social, and an understanding of what made him and the world what they are. Action will not be right unless it relates meaningfully the personality of the agent and the require ments of his society. A humanistic education will essay to evoke the widest possible range of re sponses to the stimuli of civilization. It Will expose the individual to representa tive specimens of the several fields of cul tural endeavor and a large selection of significant facts designed to supplement, and to enrich the context of, personal ex perience. The individual data are cen tered on a concept of the nature of man from which is derived the knowledge of how he must act to preserve his dignity as a person and a member of society and to widen the collectively conquered area of civilization. A humanistic education is a guided process of progressive self-interpreta tion, aspiring after a principle or princi ples through which the totality of human experience can be organized and under stood in essence and development. The closer the human reality is apprehended, the closer will right action be approxi mated. To a humanistic education as adminis tered within the civilization of the West the consideration of Islam commends it self on these grounds: 1. Islam presents the spectacle of the development of a world religion in the full light of history. Mr. Von Grunebaum is Professor of Arabic in the University of Chicago. 2. It presents the further spectacle of the widening of this religion into a civili zation. 3. In the development of this Islamic civilization foreign cultural traditions were absorbed, modified, and again elim inated. Some of these traditions have also gone into the making of the West. Thus the growth and decline of Islamic civili zation between the seventh and the twelfth centuries a.d. illuminate almost dramatically the processes of cultural interaction and culture transformation, as well as the concept of cultural influ ence as such. 4. Islamic civilization constitutes a complete system of thought and be havior growing out of a fundamental im pulse and enveloping man in all his re lations, to God, the universe, and him self. This system is both close enough to the western view of the world to be intel lectually and emotionally understand able and sufficiently far removed from it to deepen, by contrast, the self-interpre tation of the West.1 I Like Christianity and Manichaeanism, Islam is a revealed religion in which the person of the revealing agent forms an integral part of the faith. It is not suf ficient to believe in the message brought the Arabs by Muhammad, the son of cAbdall?h, of Mecca (ca. a.d. 570-June 8, 632); it is also imperative to believe in the significance of the election, by the Lord, of Muhammad and none other as the Seal of the Prophets. The creed links 1 The sheer usefulness of familiarity with the large section of the globe held by Islamic civili zation is obvious, but the value of unintegrated information concerning the Muslim world is of a different order from that here considered. 12</page><page sequence="2">ISLAM IN A HUMANISTIC EDUCATION 13 the two fundamental verities: "I testify that there is no god but God (Allah) and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God." To himself, Muhammad is a mere man; there is no claim to consubstantiality, in whatever guise, with the divinity; he is no thaumaturge, although he is frequently pressured to perform miracles in substan tiation of his mission. His one and only miracle is the Book, as it has been in one form or another the evidentiary and intel lectual center of any respectable faith since the last centuries b.c.; and this mir acle is his, only in so far as it is given to and through him. Whenever he is not guided by direct revelation, he is fallible in thought and deed. He does not consider himself the exemplar on which the faith ful are to model their lives, although, as time went by, his came to be considered the ideal life and his personality the quin tessence of perfection, human and super human; and, in yielding to the changing dreams of the ages, he was understood as the great ascetic, the intercessor with God for the believers, the mystic saint, the mir acle-worker with knowledge of the hid den, the descendant of Adam and heir of his spark of divine substance, the cause of creation, the hub of the universe. God's message is universal but is con veyed to different peoples by different messengers and at different times. Each messenger is sent to his own people with a partial version in his own tongue of the Book's heavenly prototype. There have been many such messengers in the past ?tradition knows of 124,000?but with Muhammad, who was vouchsafed the final and most perfect message, the end of Revelation has been reached. It is the very identity of his message with that of his predecessors like Moses and Jesus that vouches for Muhammad's veracity. When, to his profound dismay, the Jews and Christians failed to recognize their scrip tures in his teachings, Muhammad real ized that they had falsified their original Revelation and that God had sent him to restore the unadulterated religion of Abraham, the father of Ishmael, the an cestor of the Arabs. Before Muhammad, Marcion and Mani had already developed the notion that the disciples inevitably corrupt the doctrine of the master; and Mani, at least, had taken great care to prevent this fate from happening to his ideas. Muhammad was successful to the extent that the text of his Book has come down to us undistorted. It would seem that Arab paganism, never systematized or given a philosophic skeleton, had been losing its grip during the sixth century a.D. It had been a faith of great local variations, with astral color ing among the more civilized groups, but everywhere still close to primitive fetish istic forms of worship. Mecca, a com mercial community that had grown up around the sanctuary of the Ka"ba and a cosmopolitan town, harbored a sizable foreign population, many of them Jews and Christians of a sort; and there is evi dence of a feeling of religious dissatis faction and of a seeking for something new, something purer and intellectually more substantial than the inherited and but lukewarmly held polytheism. The age had begun to be concerned with the Hereafter. It was the fear of the End, the trembling before the Judgment to which Muhammad gave expression in his first inspired utterances. By turning away from the idols that are but wood or stone and accepting the truth of the one and only God, the Creator and Lord of heaven and earth, man could win rescue from the horrors of the Day and the eternal pun ishment that was to be meted out soon; for it was rescue rather than salvation that the age craved and that Muhammad offered. People found themselves fright ened and conscious of their evil deeds. The Fire was threatening them, and they yearned for protection. But they did not feel sinful to the core, corrupt in their essence, laboring under the metaphysical consequences of a Fall. No original sin had to be expunged. They were not in need of salvation through divine self sacrifice, they needed information as to</page><page sequence="3">14 JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION the true God and as to the behavior that he demanded. Islam has never developed sacramental mysteries, it has remained faithful to the impulse of its origin by showing erring man the path to paradise in a purely rational, almost technical, manner. But man, rewarded or punished, remains man?God does not descend to earth to lift man beyond himself. In fact, as apologetic and polemic literature am ply testifies, to this very day the concept of the suffering God as well as the com plementary concepts of original sin and salvation from sin have remained alien to Islam to the point of being intellec tually incomprehensible, owing to the utter foreignness of the Lebensgef?hl that evoked the longings and the doc trines to satisfy them. The immediate means of attaining this rescue and of meeting the emergency of the impending catastrophe was the ac ceptance of monotheism under the guid ance of the Lord's authorized Messenger. It is not easy to gauge when Muhammad abandoned his terrifying vision of the End of the World as close by; but, as time wore on, his anxiety was somewhat calmed by a realization of the indefinite postponement of the hour. What it took the early Christians decades to accept, Muhammad acknowledged after a very few years?as the Lord was pleased to continue this world for a further reprieve, short or long, his community had to be settled in it in complete conformance with his revealed instructions. So it became the task of the community to evolve a com prehensive pattern for a life under God, covering every phase of human existence from conception to burial and eliminating any distinction between the sacred and the profane aspects of life by making every instant of it religiously relevant and requiring ritualistic perfection for the performance of any action whatso ever. In this manner behavior was stereo typed to a point, but the whole of life, down to its most repulsive detail, was given the supreme dignity of religious significance. And not only was the life of the individual to be transformed into a sequence of divinely required acts, but Muslim society as a whole was to be equally transformed: the state, the army, the treasury became in the terminology of the early believers the state of God&gt; the army of God, the treasury of God. It is the quest for the correct life that stands out as the supreme motive of the Islamic experiment; it is the conflict be tween this life and the exigencies of this world ( frequently personified to the pious as lawless rulers, hypocrites, and here tics) that largely dominates the internal history of Islam. The increasingly narrow and worried interpretation of the ideal that had early become, in its elaboration and administration, the vested interest of a class of jurist-theologians would seem to bear most of the guilt of the corroding discord between fiction and reality that, in the later Middle Ages, pervades Mus lim society more profoundly than it does, of necessity, any human organization. The relatively minor role of doctrine as contrasted with behavior is reflected in the five "pillars" of Islam, the fundamen tal obligations imposed on each and every believer. The Prophet is supposed to have said: "Islam is built upon five things, testi mony that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God; prayer; the poor-rate; pilgrimage [to Mecca]; and fast in Ramad?n."2 Correctness as the basic purpose of life makes for authoritarianism. Duties and doctrine can be accepted as binding only when imposed by, or derived from, a source that is beyond human question ing. Directly or indirectly any regulation should go back to the Lord himself. The Koran ( ?ur^?n, from Syriac qery?n?, lec tio and lectionary) as the collection of all preserved revelations?undertaken under the caliph cUthm?n (644-56)-, in other words, the direct speech of the Lord ad dressed to Muhammad, is marked out as the foremost authority. To the Muslim, 2 Quoted by D. B. Macdonald, Development of Muslim Theology, Jurisprudence, and Consti tutional Theory (New York, 1903), p. 292.</page><page sequence="4">ISLAM IN A HUMANISTIC EDUCATION 15 the Koran treats of every subject, but more specifically of matters of faith, legal prescriptions, and prophetic history. The first Arabic book, composed in frequently relaxed rhymed prose and put together from records of the individual revelations in a somewhat arbitrary manner, the Koran contains, especially in its eschato logical suras or sections, many a beauti ful passage. In mastering the difficulties of expressing trains of thought not hither to articulated in Arabic, Muhammad shows himself a literary innovator of con siderable stature. A certain clumsiness, say, in legal formulations3 is as palpable as is the defective technique of narration when it comes to telling complex stories of former prophets and the like, particu larly when the koranic style is compared with the matchless grace and precision with which later Arabic authors present narrative material. To the Muslim, how ever, the Koran as the Word of God is inimitable in point of diction, and the desire to explain its stylistic uniqueness has been one powerful impulse toward the development of an Arabic theory of literature. Muslims are agreed that the Koran requires philological explanation; they are not agreed on the extent to which exegesis is admissible. But as faith neces sitates the harmonization of the personal or the school viewpoint with Revelation, philosophical, mystical, and any kind of partisan exegesis, best served by allegori cal interpretation, is unavoidable. But, even upon acceptance of a gener ous measure of interpretative elasticity, the Koran will not resolve every problem of the religious life. It is necessary to fall back on the sunna, the prophetic custom or tradition, as a second authority. In the absence of a koranic line, a private saying of the Prophet or a contemporary report on his behavior in a given situation will be decisive. The more in the conscious ness of the community the Messenger was transformed into a thaumaturge, the more easily could political prophesies ex even tu, school doctrines, and, in general, say ings reflecting the state of mind of the times be ascribed to him. To the com munity, the sunna acquired an impor tance that allowed it to override on occa sion the express statement of the Book itself. This willingness to accept reality under a relatively thin disguise of pro phetic indorsement is more clearly evi denced in the recognition of the con sensus of the community as a third au thority after Koran and sunna. Methodo logically justified by the alleged words of Muhammad, "My community will never be agreed on an error," the i/mac of the learned that does not make decisions of a programmatic character but only states what has become common (and there with binding ) practice and belief has per mitted the integration into Islam of essen tially "anti-Islamic" elements, such as the cult of saints, and thereby prevented too dangerous a chasm between the tra ditional norm and the practice of the day. Nevertheless, Islam has always been traditionalist. The examples to be fol lowed belong to the ever more remote past. Muhammad's early followers were the best generation; their successors, the second best. From then on, the world has been deteriorating and will continue to deteriorate until it comes to its appointed end. The living generation is not per mitted to change the inherited ways?for change must needs be for the worse. Innovation in religious matters (and re ligion covers everything relevant to the good life) is to be rejected, the innovator liable to punishment. The reformer there fore either adduces prophetic or koranic witness for his proposal or advocates the return to the golden age of primitive Is lam. The pattern may not be abandoned or even modified; it may only be stripped of accretions and freed of distortions that 3 Cf., e.g., Koran 2:282-83, on recording of debts. The best and most recent English trans lation of the Koran by R. Bell (Edinburgh, 1937 39) offers an analysis of the 114 s?ras or chap ters. These chapters, which are of unequal length, owe their arrangement to the discretion of the government commission that had been charged with collecting the extant revelations into an authoritative Book.</page><page sequence="5">16 JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION have accumulated in course of time. The heroic, the creative, age is past. This is true outside the religious sphere, too. The critics fight hard, if unsuccessfully, to con tain poetry within the limits of the pre Islamic tradition and prevent it from adapting to changed conditions and changed emotions. Only in the ninth and tenth centuries is there a feeling of youth fulness in the intellectual world, a feeling that the ancients can be equaled and surpassed. Fatimid propaganda in Africa stresses the youth of the dynasty as op posed to the decrepit regime of the Abba sid house in Baghdad. But this self-confi dence is far from being shared by all, and it wanes in the eleventh century without having affected the general attitude of looking backward for the guiding ideals. The authority of tradition is best up held by a formalistic approach which gives promise of eliminating the wilful ness of personal reasoning. When the community found itself flooded with an immense and steadily growing number of forged sayings of Muhammad, criteria for sifting the genuine from the spurious had to be found. Instead of concentrating on an analysis of the content, the collectors studied the chain of witnesses that linked the latest reporter of the apophthegm to the Prophet himself.4 These inquiries laid the ground for impressive biographi cal studies that remained unparalleled in the West until comparatively recent times, but they failed to provide an ob stacle to the learned forger nor did they, to the modern mind, establish the ma terial trustworthiness of the sayings. Prayer as included among the five 'pil lars" is ritual prayer, not personal invo cation or communion with God. It con sists of a fairly complicated sequence of formulas that are recited in co-ordination with a sequence of exactly prescribed body-movements. Ablution and the cov ering of (parts of) the body are two necessary preliminaries. The prayers are to be performed five times a day at stated times, preferably in common, in the mosque and behind a prayer-leader. Im mense attention has been given by the canon lawyers to the detail of the per formance and to any accidental circum stance that might invalidate it. Ghazz?l? (d. 1111), perhaps the greatest theolo gian of Islam, has to combat their view that it is the outward acts and utterances rather than the inner attitude that de termines the validity of the prayer. He de fines the limitations of the Law: [Canon Lawyers] build up the external side of the laws of the religion upon the ex ternal side of the acts of the members, since the external side of the acts is a sufficient guard against being killed or chastised by the sultan. As to whether the external side of these acts benefits in the next abode, this is not within the bounds of canon law, be cause it is not possible to claim agreement on this point.5 Islam is permeated by a sense of the autocracy of the Lord. The Lord is One, All-Powerful, not bound by the moral law, in no way obliged to give man right guidance or to reward and punish him according to his obedience or disobedi ence. The greatness of AU?h is empha sized through the helpless weakness of man, his most illustrious creature. It seems rather obvious that the real reason for the Muslim denial of laws of nature, of an eternal order of things by which God binds himself to abide, is due not so much to dialectical considerations as to the overpowering impulse to revel in the contemplation of All?h's unrestrained majesty, even though it is at the cost of man's self-abasement and the injection of an element of whimsicality in the govern 4 Cf.

Formalistic treat ment or the application of the scholastic method is extended to literary theory from the twelfth century; it is very instructive to compare, e.g., cAbdalq?hir al-Jurj?nfs (d. 1078) Asr?r al-hal?gha and Dal?Hl al-fj?z with the com pletely "seholasticized" summary given by Jurj?nfs admirer, the theologian Fakhr ad-D?n ar-R?z? (d. 1209) in his Nih?yat aUj?z.</page><page sequence="6">ISLAM IN A HUMANISTIC EDUCATION 17 ment of the universe. The apparent causal regularity of events reflects not irrevoca ble law but the Lord's habitual proce dure. Like the benevolent despot on earth whose absurdly magnified reflection he is, the Lord is, on the whole, kindly in clined toward his creatures and disposed to lighten the burden of their obligations, to take a lenient view of their efforts, and to be approachable by his favorites, espe cially the Prophet Muhammad, when they intercede for the erring believer. Orthodox Islam is imbued with the reali zation, shared by (if not inherited from) the Gnostic world and later on by Calvin and Pascal, that an act of awakening, transforming grace will always have to precede man's own effort to draw near God. With merciless precision the Koran declares: "We have created for Gehenna (Hell) many of the jinn and of mankind" (Koran 7:178). And again: 'Whomsoever He willeth, All?h sendeth astray, and whomsoever He willeth He setteth on a straight path."6 The Muctazila, the founders of specu lative dogmatics in Islam?the school arises in the eighth century?fought the anthropomorphism of the othodox con cept of God and argued for the strictest possible interpretation of Allah's unity. But, in teaching that God will always do what is best and wisest for his creation, they limit his arbitrary omnipotence. By co-ordinating human behavior and the divine reaction on a more conventional moral level, they are clearly animated by a different outlook on man, whose dig nity they are asserting and protecting by their emphasis on the Lord's justice. Orthodoxy has never ceased to represent the opposite attitude. Personal piety in the first generations of believers remained dominated by fear. The greatest religious genius of the pe riod, Hasan al-Basrf (d. 728), was first and foremost an ascetic of harsh auster ity. "The main theme of his teaching and preaching was a call to repentance be cause of the wrath that was to come, and he urged his hearers to despise this transi tory life and all that belonged to this world which perishes.... We are told that when Hasan heard of a man who would be saved in the end, after a thousand years in Hell, he fell to weeping and said, Would that I might be like that man/ "7 The formalism of man's relations to God as laid down in the canon law and what appeared to many the transformation of religion into jurisprudence directed pious sentiment toward the seeking of an im mediate contact with the Lord. Fear and reverence were to be balanced by love and trust. By complete and exclusive de votion, the believer could enter into his Lord's familiarity, be vouchsafed the di vine vision, and submerge his own self in ecstasy in the divine essence. Mystic ex perience bridged the abyss, considered impassable by the theologian, between man and God, leading in some instances to full pantheistic self-identification of the servant with the Master. Most ration alizing effort of the mystics was con cerned with showing the compatibility of their experience with the orthodox norm, the possibility of reconciling the exclusiveness of the prophetic mission with the personal contact between the mystic adept and his God. Before the latent opposition between the mystic and the official approach had come to a head ?in fact, before the theological impli cations of their mystic approach had completely dawned on its prof essors?the great woman-saint, R?bfa al-cAdawiyya (d. ca. 801), spoke to God in inspired unconcern: I have loved Thee with two loves, a selfish love and a love that is worthy (of Thee), As for the love which is selfish, I occupy my self therein with remembrance of Thee to the exclusion of all others, As for that which is worthy of Thee, therein Thou raisest the veil that I may see Thee. ?Koran 6:39; repeated several times, e.g., 13:27 and 14:4; the translation is that of R. Bell, The Qur&gt;?n (Edinburgh, 1937-39). 7 Margaret Smith, Studies in Early Mysticism in the Near and Middle East (London, 1931), p. 175.</page><page sequence="7">!8 JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION O my Hope and my Rest and my Delight, The heart can love none other but Thee.8 Abu Nasr as-Sarr?j (d. 988) explains that the Sufis (literally "those clad in wool," suf ) agree with the Traditionists and Jurists in their beliefs and accept their sciences and consult them in difficult matters of religious law. Should there be a difference of opinion, the S?f?s always adopt the principle of fol lowing the strictest and most perfect course; they venerate the commandments of God and do not seek to evade them. Such is their practice in regard to the formal sciences handled by the Traditionists and Jurists, but having left these behind they rise to heights of mystical devotion and ethical self culture which are exclusively their own.9 The jurists discuss the Koran and Tra dition, but only the S?f?s realize the feel ings referred to by terms such as "re pentance," "patience," "fear," and "hope." All Sufism is to be found in the Koran and in the sunna, but only the S?f?s have experiential access to these aspects of Revelation.10 Even had not many a mys tic drawn the logical conclusion of his position and deprecated the externals of religion and the keeping of the canonical obligations, the contradictory aspirations pursued by the jurists and the mystics would have carried the threat of the dis integration of the very basis of Islam. To the jurist-theologian the mystic's indiffer ence to doctrine appeared both impious and antisocial, while to the mystic the rationalization of the ineffable with its scholastic niceties seemed insignificant. Jal?l ad-D?n R?m? (d. 1273) said: This doctrine has become the adversary and bitter enemy of that, so that the imitator (who adopts the belief of others) is in a dilemma. The only muzzle of evil suggestions (of doubt) is Love.... O (dear) soul, Love alone cuts disputation short, for it (alone) comes to the rescue when you cry for help against arguments.11 Islam lays claim to the totality of the believer's life and thought. The commu nity as the true repository of the living faith?there is no church organization that stands apart from the body of the lay faithful?is compelled to decide its politi cal problems on religious grounds. The early sects doubtless owe their origin to deep-seated differences of outlook, reli gious and social, but they crystallized into communities within the general body of the Muslims under the impact of con crete political situations. The egalitarian and rigoristic Kh?rijites were drawn to gether by their dissent from the majority on the double question of the qualifica tions of the legitimate ruler and of the proper authority to ascertain those quali fications in specific persons (a.D. 658). The Shfites, themselves destined to split into many groups, broke away when, through the assassination of cAl? (a.D. 661) and the death in battle of his son, Husain (a.d. 680), their desire for a caliph descended from the Prophet had been decisively frustrated. What had ap peared to be a temporal issue?the quest for the rightful holder of the imamate, the leadership of the community?came to be the center of their theology. They revived the old motif of the epiphany of the di vine in man and taught that the imam, of necessity a descendant of cAl?, the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, as the carrier of a particle of the divine light or substance was the indispensable guide to eternal bliss. And it would seem that the rise of the Muctazilite school was closely connected with the rise of the Abbasid dynasty ( 750-1258 ). Majority Islam, usually called "Sun nite," has developed a rather limited con cept of political authority.

Now this or ganization is not attainable without an imam whose authority will be obeyed.13 Thus the imam and the state organization at his disposal have no other function than to make possible that life under God which the canon law has elaborated on the basis of authoritative text and tra dition. The imam must therefore protect the territory of Islam from encroachment by unbelievers, or even extend it, and must domestically keep law and order so that the believer can practice his re ligious duties in safety. The caliph is the successor of Muhammad as leader of the community; but, in his capacity as prophet and legislator, Muhammad can not have a successor. The caliph sees to it that the injunctions of the Prophet as interpreted by the orthodox juriscon sults are carried out, but he has no right to interpret them himself, let alone to add to or abrogate them. He will issue execu tive orders which have to be obeyed, he will impose taxes beyond those allowed by Revelation; but in a sense this activity of his will always be tainted with illegal ity; it will be dangerous for the pious to get caught in administration and espe cially in the administration of justice. The canon-law judge, the q?d?, will find him self unable to take care effectively of all contingencies; another type of court, that of "wrongs," maz?lim, will be developed in which procedure is not bound by canon-law tradition and therefore is more readily adaptable to the conditions of the day. In almost every Islamic country there developed at one time or another the characteristic parallelism of law codes, one the unalterable shar\ the canon law in the systemization of one of the four recognized law schools, the other a code of "secular" origin, be it that of the conquering Mongols in Persia or a code arising gradually from custom and royal decisions, as in Egypt and Turkey. In practice the tendency has al ways been to confine the application of the shaf to matters of personal statute, so as to make the call for restoration of the sharc to full authority over all prov inces of the legal life of the community a regular part of the program of conserva tive reformers. The complete intertwining of the secu lar and the religious in a political issue becomes very real in the words which cAl? addressed to his soldiers before the battleofSiffm(A.D.657): Sacrifice yourselves! You are under the eyes of the Lord and with the cousin of His prophet. Renew your charge and disdain flight, for it will disgrace your offspring and mean the Fire for you on the Day of Reck oning. Before you are this great Saw?d [the fruitland of Iraq] and those large tents! Let blood flow profusely. For Satan is halting on his hill spreading out his two arms; he has stretched forth one hand for the assault and drawn back one foot to retreat, firmly im planted he will not budge until the truth manifests itself. But you will have the better of the struggle; God is with you and He will not allow you to lose [the merit] of your deeds!14 In contrast to the Sunnite rulers, the Shfite imams "are the mediators between God and mankind. Except by their inter cession it is impossible for men to avoid the punishment of God."15 The existence of an imam is not a matter of expediency, as is that of a Sunnite ruler; it is a meta 12 Cf., e.g., Plato Republic 473D-&amp;, and, later, Justin Martyr (First Apology iii. 2, 3), who quotes the passage. 13 al-Iqtis?d f? %ictiq?d (Damascus, n.d.), p. 105; Spanish translation by M.

Mankind is in perma nent need of guidance, and divine guid ance is vouchsafed only through the sin less imam. From this it follows that the imam has legislative prerogatives. It does not follow, however, that the imam must be in power or even that he must be visible to the mass of mankind. In fact, for the majority of the Shfites the last historically traceable imam, Muhammad Ab?l-Q?sim, removed himself from sight (in a.D. 879) but continues his spiritual function as the Hidden Imam, who at God's appointed time will return and openly take up the government of the world. The present rulers are but his stadtholders, so to speak, whose author ity derives from him. As late as 1906 the first constitution of Persia embodied the statement that parliament was to be es tablished with the agreement and con sent of the (Hidden) Imam of the Age.16 There cannot be equality between those who have and those who spurn absolute truth. Muhammad extended limited recognition to those religious groups that possessed a book, such as the Jews and the Christians. The pagan was to be summoned to conversion or death; the scripturary was to remain out side the solidarity-circle of the ruling class unless he left his denomination voluntarily. Covenants affiliated the non Muslim denominations to the Muslim state by according them autonomy in their internal affairs. Non-Muslims were liable to taxation beyond that imposable on Muslims, subjected to legalized social and professional discrimination, excluded from military service, and, in theory, barred from executive government office. They reproduced on a more parochial scale the organization of the Muslim state. This state came to harbor an in creasing number of religiopolitical en claves, owing to the tendency, already apparent in the late Roman and Byzan tine empires, for unsuccessful sectarian movements to settle in an outlying prov ince and organize as a semi-independent and statelike society. Whether or not Muhammad had in the course of his career come to envisage his mission as addressed to all mankind, the Muslim community did so interpret it. To spread the faith and to widen the Muslim-ruled territory was one of the principal duties of the caliph. The Law did not recognize the possibility of peace with the unbelievers, although expedi ency might require long periods of truce. But the task of extending the realm of truth on earth will not be fulfilled as long as non-Muslims remain in control of any part of this globe. II The tendencies inherent in the origins of Islam were to mature under the influ ence of those, in a sense, accidental con tacts which grew out of the historical setting of the period and, more specifi cally, the conquest by the Muslims of the high-civilization areas of Persia, Syria, and Egypt. In assessing the Islamic achievement, it must be realized that the backward ness of the Arabian peninsula in relation to the cultural level of the neighboring countries made the early development of Islam largely a process of adjustment to the traditions of the older Near Eastern civilizations. The mental and political energy of the invaders prevented their absorption by the more numerous arid more advanced subject peoples. Prosely tism increased with the passing of time, and after four centuries Hither Asia (ex cept for Byzantine territory ) had become overwhelmingly Muslim. For some time conversion was politically and socially incomplete as long as it was not fol lowed up by affiliation as a client with an Arab tribe, but gradually this un canonic requirement lapsed and the non Arabs became full-fledged Muslims in their own right. Jewish and Christian thought-motifs had been instrumental in the formation of the Prophet's ideas; biblical and hag 16 Cf. I.

His very monotheism was devel oped at least partially in controversy against Christian trinitarianism. But the way of life imposed by Muhammad, the ritual of the pilgrimage, and, on the level of verbalization and argumentation, a certain prephilosophical crudeness?all this was genuinely Arab; and, with the pilgrimage anchored among the essen tials of the faith and the Koran the per manent point of departure for theological thought, much of the Arab heritage has been preserved. It was not only the par tial identification of Islam and Arabism through the development of Arabic into the representative language of Muslim civilization and the inalienable prestige of the Arabs as the compatriots of the "Best of Mankind" and the rulers of the early empire which helped to keep an Arabic veneer on the composite culture of medieval (and modern) Islam. It was much rather the development of original forms of presentation like the had?th, prophetic saying, with its witness-chain, isn?d, and text, matn, and its expansion into histories like the Ska ( "biography" ) of the Prophet by Ibn Ish?q (d. 767) or the Annals of Tabar? (d. 923). And al though on occasion the originality of the form may be questioned, the perfect ac culturation is beyond doubt. The Mus lim scholars sometimes voiced their con sciousness of having appropriated for eign materials or foreign forms, but not a single borrowing proved effective, let alone lasting, unless Arabicized in termi nology and cast into a familiar thought pattern. Acquaintance with Christian theology compelled the reluctant Muslims to over haul and make explicit their faith in the terms of Greek thought-categories, a rep etition of the process through which, some centuries earlier, Christianity had attained its intellectual elaboration. This developmental analogy constitutes one cause for that conspicuous unity of feel ing and thinking in which East and West are tied, unconsciously for the most part, throughout the Middle Ages. Greek phi losophy, especially Aristotelian and Neo Platonic and, to a less degree, Stoic, was studied intensively during the ninth and tenth centuries. But in philosophy as well as in less crucial fields, like literary theo ry, the age was not prepared to accept unadulterated Hellenism. The Islamic peripatetics, fal?sifa (plural of failas?f, philosophos) always remained outside the pale as far as the feeling of the ma jority was concerned, while the Muctazila, although often decried as heretics, always "belonged," even as Qud?ma's (d. 922) literary system, despite the clarity of its Greek-inspired categorization, never achieved the success which came to the less complete and fairly disorganized sys tem of Ibn al-Muctazz (d. 908), who had been better able to Axabicize what he had learned from classical masters. The religious needs of the community, to which, in the last analysis, theology will have to bow, were barely touched by foreign ideas. The great dispute of the ninth century?the relation of God to his Book, a replica in one sense of the prob lem of the relation of the Logos to the Father and in another a special appli cation of the problem of divine accidents ?led to government intervention on the side of the Muctazila, who pronounced the Koran created by, and thus secondary to, God so as to avoid the "polytheistic" solution of positing two entities existing ab aeterno. Orthodoxy considered the Book as uncreate and coeval with All?h. Popular sentiment was with the ortho dox, and in due time the government yielded. The boundless reverence for the Book which had inspired orthodox argu ment then came to express itself in the startling, but emotionally satisfying, ab surdity of a doctrine which declared even the actual copy of the Book in the be liever's hand and his actual recitation from it as uncreate. Greek thought, espe cially of the postclassical period, was better able to penetrate sectarian circles when the attempt was made to Islamicize Gnostic concepts toward the end of the</page><page sequence="11">22 JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION millennium. But, while the formal frame work and the logical tooling would be Hellenistic in a general sense, koranic and Islamic materials and associations would provide the factual or fictional core. Similarly, the Hellenization (large ly through Syriac mediation) of mystical terminology and (in part) theory must have eluded the pious, owing to its per fect integration in the traditional lan guage of devotion. In the sphere of scientific activities, on the other hand, the consciousness of a definite distinction between indigenous and foreign sciences never disappeared, however much the Muslim scholars might have made their own and added to the classical bequest. The native or Arabic sciences explored essentially religion and language, branching out into koranic exe gesis, koranic criticism (i.e., the study of the readings of the text), the science of Tradition (had?th), jurisprudence and scholastic theology; and grammar, lexi cography, rhetoric, and literature, respec tively. The foreign sciences, cul?m al awail (literally, "the sciences of the an cients") were defined by the Spaniard, Ibn Tuml?s (d. 1223), as those common to all peoples and religious communities, as opposed to such sciences as had been peculiarly developed by Islam.17 They are primarily the propaedeutic, physical, and metaphysical sciences of the Greeks: the various branches of mathematics, phi losophy, natural history ( zoology, botany, etc. ), medicine, astronomy, music, magic, and alchemy.18 The study of these foreign sciences, however intense and fruitful, never fought clear of a measure of distrust on the part of the pious. In fact, the ani mosity toward these studies increased in the later Middle Ages, and there can be little doubt that the hostility was called forth not only by the subject matter but also by the foreign and non-Muslim au thorities on which they largely relied. The pious is to avoid any science that might endanger his faith. He is to heed the fundamental division of the sciences, not as foreign and native, but as (reli giously) praiseworthy and blameworthy. All sciences are blameworthy that are useless for this or the other world. The Prophet is alleged to have prayed to God to protect him against useless knowledge. Orthodox theology inclined toward an interpretation of 4 useful" as necessary or helpful for the practice of religion, camal. In this manner two semi-independent strands of intellectual effort were culti vated side by side, with the ancient sci ences slowly losing out in the perpetual struggle between the theological and the philosophical-scientific approach. The civil wars shifted the political center of the empire from Arabia, first to Syria and then (ca. a.d. 750) to Iraq. The Abbasid rulers in Baghdad carried through what might be called the trans formation of the state from the patri monial to the "rational" stage, a process that had already been started toward the end of the Syrian period. The adminis tration was stabilized on the Sassanian model, the number of government bu reaus increased, their functions were more clearly defined, and chancellery procedure was meticulously regulated. In the tenth century the administration of the caliph worked through about a dozen central boards, d?w?ns, such as the War Office, the Board of Expenditure (mostly concerned with the requirements of the court), the State Treasury, the Dispatch Board, and the General Post Office (which also discharged the duties of the secret police). The vizier presided over the heads of the individual d?w?ns. 17 Cf. I. Goldziher, "Die Stellung der alten islamischen Orthodoxie zu den antiken Wis senschaften," Abh. Berliner Akad.

It was usually the first step to local independence when both offices were intrusted to the same person. The annual budget was carefully worked out, and the growth of the appropriation for the court at the expense of public serv ices, such as maintenance of border forti fications or road-building in the tenth century mirrors the decline of the empire and some of its causes.19 The chancellery was staffed by literary men, who in their relation to the court played a role com parable to that of the humanists in the bureaus of Western states during the Renaissance. By and large, Islam had been able to win the first loyalty of the masses, but it was unable to eliminate nationalism as a social and political force. The non Arab nations compensated for their de pressed status by playing up their cul tural accomplishments and the deeds of their ancestors. They reproached the Arabs for their barbarous manners and customs and raked up tribal scandals with a view to casting doubts on that para mount pride of the Arab, his genealogy. The Arabs struck back, particularly after Persian influence at the Abbasid court had come to outweigh theirs, basing their claim to superiority above all on their kinship with the Messenger of God and then on the unexcelled richness of their language and the matchless beauties of their poetry. The level of these discus sions is somewhat childish but not much more so than that of similar contests be tween Greeks and barbarians regarding their respective contributions to civiliza tion in the Hellenistic age. The political breakup that began in the eighth but became really acute only in the ninth and tenth centuries mostly fol lowed national lines. Spain, Berber North Africa, and Egypt in the West and the Iranian countries in the East regained their independence, de facto or de jure; even within the Arabic-speaking territory of Syria, Iraq, and the peninsula the re gional interests reasserted themselves. This breakup added Cairo and Cordova to the centers of Arabic-Islamic civiliza tion. It was never completely repaired, but it did not impair the cultural coher ence of the region. Scholars traveled free ly throughout the Islamic world, states men passed easily from the service of one prince into that of another. Common faith and common education overrode political divisions. Political and denomi national, national and social, affiliations overlapped. The sects were international but usually had a localized political base and connections with definite strata of society, like that of the extreme Shfa with the artisan guilds. Sunnite Islam was very slow to exclude dissenters. The Prophet was quoted as saying that the difference of opinion within the community was a mercy from the Lord and as indicating that Islam would see the growth of seventy-three sects, all but one of which would be on the right path. The theo logians, although hesitant when it comes to the precise definition of those to be excommunicated, are more rigorous than popular sentiment. The sects are by na ture exclusive and likely to recognize true believership only in their own members. Ghazz?l?20 bars the fal?sifa from the com munity. He feels uncertain about Mucta zilites, anthropomorphists, and "the other sects," as their errors are shaded deli cately and are compensated by their hold ing correct beliefs in some respects. The only rule which in his view is established by the Koran is that the denier of the Prophet must be excommunicated. ( This discussion must be understood in the light of the fact that there does not exist in Islam a body whose decision would be binding on all Muslims, although in spe cific cases a body of theologians may au !9 On the organization of the state cf., e.g., R.

Ill In every age self-expression is limited in part by convention that compels the speaker or writer to dwell on some, and disregard other, aspects of his experience, and in part by the heritage of forms and imagery of which the individual may dis pose. Arabic literature, like Greek and Ro man, is very conscious of the peculiar re quirements of the several kinds, but its repertory of kinds is considerably smaller than that of classical antiquity. Of the three basic genres which antiquity de veloped, drama and epic are absent. Poe try rates higher than prose ( an occasional dissenting theorist notwithstanding) be cause it demands the greater skill. The ability to master the intricacies of pros ody and the formal rules binding the various types of poetry attracts the admi ration of the public. The public and, even more, the average critic, who as a rule started out as a grammarian and lexicographer, insist on the maintenance of traditional norms?the ode, qas?da, must begin with reflections on bygone love and preferably refer to the scene of his love, now forsaken; the poet must pro fess to seek comfort by mounting a mag nificent camel for a perilous ride through the desert; and he must conclude by ad dressing a request to a high-placed per sonality or by praising his tribe (or him self) or acting as spokesman for his group on some political issue. The classical, i.e., pagan, tradition remained the strongest single strain in Arabic poetry throughout the Middle Ages and down to the begin nings of the twentieth century, although Persian (e.g., introduction of new meters and the banqueting song) and Hellenistic influences (e.g., new attitudes in love poetry) were absorbed readily enough. The real centers of pre-Islamic civili zation were urban settlements, but its literature was dedicated to the glorifica tion of Bedouin ideals. The authority ac corded it kept an incongruous note of desert lyrics in Islamic poetry. The early Abbasid age witnessed a remarkable efflorescence of poetical achievement. Modes were found to capture the color ful gaiety of the court, the moralizing sentiment of the repenting libertine, and that subtilized and worshipful love which was destined to pass through Spain into the songs of the Troubadours, along with some of the complicated prosodical forms of which the Spanish Arabs were fond. Modernistic poets toyed with new meters of lighter rhythm, while the conservatives used the inherited framework for a dis play of verbal virtuosity. Under the pa tronage of the courts and the dignitaries of the empire, the poet became the mouthpiece of the political powers; his economic and social status rose in many instances, but poetry lost what the poets may have gained. Reckless eulogizing and equally reckless lampooning, the need to outdo the predecessor and the rival in giving vent to the same kind of sentiments and aspirations, accompanied by a taste which confined the poet to a limited body of subject matter and which applauded originality in the successful recasting of the familiar motif?this com bination of trends led to the increasing paralysis of creativeness and to the slow ly dulling sparkle of verbal tours de force that is so characteristic of the poetry of the later Middle Ages. Only mysticism preserved its productive independence by providing the poet with an experience too strong to be fully dominated by conven tion. Here the danger was not traditional ism but abstruseness. The impressionistic taste of the Arab is reflected in his insistence on the per fection of the individual verse rather than the composition of the whole; in prose, in his preference for anecdote and sketch instead of extended narrative; only popu lar prose exceeds moderate length but its tales actually consist of a collection of semicoherent episodes.</page><page sequence="14">ISLAM IN A HUMANISTIC EDUCATION 25 Consistently planned and carefully exe cuted composition appears to be the pre rogative of the Persians, who developed from a tradition of historical writing an even greater tradition of epic represen tation, with their own history, romance, and mysticism providing successively the subjects most favored by the public. The Persians, who also developed a religious drama centering on the death of Husain at Kerbela (a.d. 680), surpassed the Arabs in creative imagination, perhaps also in a willingness to abandon them selves to the intoxicating associations of figurative and symbolic speech. Funda mentally, however, their taste was the taste of the Arabs; and, on the whole, the literary taste of Islam paralleled that of the medieval West?in its submission to formal tradition, its intellectualiza tion, its learned character, its emphasis on technique, its predilection for "gold and glitter" and for description in gen eral, and most of all in its craving for ghar?ba, curiositas, the startling, the strange, the unusual. The Muslim poet wishes to astound the hearer. As in the European secentismo, his concetti are meant to induce a feeling of wonderment and surprise, of maraviglia, cajab. What imagery and witticism are supposed to effect in poetry, digressions, the inser tion of mirabilia, and rapid shifts from subject to subject will do in prose. The flagging of the readers attention is to be avoided by every means, and it seems that the reader was unwilling to concen trate on one theme for a prolonged period of time; so episodic distraction and the near-destruction of coherent composition appeared imperative even to some of the greatest litt?rateurs. The conquest of subject matter through a deepening of the psychological interest in man was successful only in the unre flected presentation of persons and inci dents, in which again the authors of the ninth and tenth centuries excelled. How ever, a certain discretion, which is still characteristic of the Muslim manner, has prevented the literary analysis of the human soul and with it the rise of a psychologically adequate biography in the Greek and modern sense of the word. This is true in spite of the fact that the collections of biographies which Islam has produced are amazing achievements as regards the accumulation of material and that the Western Middle Ages have nothing remotely comparable to offer. The Muslim writer is a keen observer of emotions, but he confines his portrayal of them to the religious tract or the auto biographical description of conversion and perhaps the historical anecdote. Only devotional poetry benefited. Scholarship (outside the natural sci ences), which went through a renascence in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, better preserved its insistence on the cre ative contribution but, at the same time, adapted its requirements to cover the majority of the works of the declining age. cAlmaw? (d. 1573) quotes an earlier authority for this statement: Literary activity has seven subdivisions: (1) The creation of something new. (2) The correction of the shortcomings which exist in a particular work. (3) The indication of the various mistakes (found in a particular work). (4) The explanation of difficulties which excessive brevity has caused in a par ticular work. (5) The shortening of tedious lengthy passages, without complicating the understanding of the whole work. (6) The proper arrangement of badly arranged mate rial in a manner which would as little as pos sible disturb (the original arrangement). And (7) the proper arrangement of materials which were badly arranged in the work of a predecessor, in an intelligent manner which would make the new work more suitable for didactic purposes.21 Pre-Islamic Arabia's contribution to the arts did not go beyond her achievement in poetry. There was no native tradition in the fine arts on which Islam could build. So "art in Islamic countries is a derivative of the classical traditions fol lowed in various Oriental countries pre ceding the Arab conquest. Sometimes this 21 Trans. F. Rosenthal, The Technique and Approach of Muslim Scholarship (Rome, 1947), pp. 64-65.</page><page sequence="15">26 JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION influence is rather pure and direct; in other cases the influence came by way of Sassanian and Coptic art. There are also extraneous influences, such as those from India."22 The austerity which Islam in its cere monial aspects never lost denied to crafts manship the incentive of working pre cious metals for mosque treasuries and put a brake on architectural exuberance. The mosque is originally a bare and simply articulated building; in the Arab countries an open court with fountains for the ritual ablutions is usually larger than the mosque proper. A tower from which the call to prayer is sounded adds a striking feature to the complex of build ings. The walls of the interior, unless they remain simply whitewashed, are deco rated with ornamentalized script-bands of koranic verses and the names of the Prophet and his "well-guided" successors. Often the script is placed on enameled tiles, whose soft colors and designs tend to relieve the harsh calm of the empty hall without narrowing it down. The age old aversion to pictorial representation of living beings which has asserted itself in Hither Asia in several periods within different civilizations has in Islam crystal lized in the much-quoted saying attrib uted to the Prophet that the artist will be asked on Judgment Day to breathe life into the figures he wrought and that he will be condemned to the Fire if unable to do so. Since there were no saints in early and in official Islam, painting in any case would have had to concentrate on worldly subjects. Departure from life likeness was the device that the Islamic artist used to avoid the presumption of "creating" living beings. The book-paint er, especially the Persian, did not shy away from portraying scenes of Muslim history and of the life of Muhammad, even venturing at times to picture the Prophet himself. But, in spite of the su perb development of miniaturing, the religiously sanctioned prejudice stunted the growth of painting and completely barred sculpture. Architecture and the so-called "minor arts," prominently in cluding calligraphy, remained the prin cipal areas in which the Islamic artist was able to express himself. Decoration largely took the place of representation. A horror vacui caused every available space on wall, manuscript, or vase and platter to be covered with luxuriant, la boriously interlaced ornaments, in which end merges into beginning, fragments of Scripture into lineaments without ration al meaning. The fully decorated mosque is still austere, but no longer simple. The ornament is designed to blur the clarity of the architectural plan. In taste and in tent Islamic art is as far removed from its classical inspiration as is Islamic poe try from the classical inspiration of its theory. IV This world is no more than a proving ground on which man prepares for the final judgment. It will surely come to an end, and the signs by which mankind will know its approach have been revealed in many an eschatological tradition. History is restricted to a comparatively short period. If it is to be told as far as un folded, the tale must begin with Creation and record the revelations accorded to the several peoples and tell of the rise and decline of kings and empires in the shadow of God's favor and God's wrath. With Muhammad the beginning of the last phase is reached, and before too long the prelude to eternity will have died away. Imbedded between two metaphys ical pivots, Creation and Judgment, man s life in history is but an episode whose true cause in God's essence or will remains in scrutable. Nevertheless, the Muslim evinces great interest in the events that take up this episode. He is fascinated with man's actions, and he is a keen and accurate recorder. The enormous collec tions of material which Islamic civiliza tion has produced tend to personalize the historical process, to avoid delving into 22 R. Ettinghausen, in The Arab Heritage, ed. N. A. Faris (Princeton, 1944), p. 251.</page><page sequence="16">ISLAM IN A HUMANISTIC EDUCATION 27 underlying causes and seeking for a com prehensive analysis and interpretation of historical forces. There was profound un derstanding of the mechanics of political growth and disintegration, but only occa sional attention was given to the social and economic background and the rea sons for the appeal of ideologies. Some slight and puzzling evidence could per haps be adduced for the existence of an undercurrent of philosophical history. What is certain, however, is a strong in terest in political theory or perhaps in a peculiar combination of political science as the systematic description of govern ment and political theory as its normative doctrine. This is to say that Islam is lack ing in a comparative study of constitu tions, that it was not inclined to investi gate the operation of the state in the ab stract, and that it remained completely uninterested in the forms of political life that had developed outside Muslim civili zation. The description of the functioning of the Muslim state is most adequate when it comes to the detail of its judicial and executive administration. In the pres entation of the role of the caliph, one senses the uneasy efforts of the author to harmonize the ideal task and the humble facts of his period. The Law has laid down unalterable principles, never en visaging the increasing incapacity of the Prince of the Believers to exercise even his more modest duties. So theory is com pelled to compromise, to stretch the con cept of election to include election by one qualified voter?in other words, to sanc tion the actual situation in which the caliph is appointed by his predecessor or the military leader who happens to be in control. Even the possibility of a plurality of leaders of the community has to be ad mitted. As in other ages and other civiliza tions, the theory of power comes to be a weapon in the fight for power.23 Too late to influence Islamic thought but in time to exploit the political and cul tural experience of the Muslim West be fore its downfall in Spain and its intellec tual ruin in North Africa, Ibn Khaldun, statesman, judge, and historian (d. 1406), attempted an interpretation of the proc ess of history. History, he explains at the beginning of his celebrated Prolegomena to his Universal History, is one of the branches of knowledge which are handed on from people to people and generation to generation; it is attractive even to the lowly and is eagerly sought after by the kings and equally appreciated by lettered and unlettered. Outwardly, it seeks to re trace the happenings that have marked past centuries and empires. It attracts by telling of the changes that people have undergone and of the deeds done by the divers nations ere they were summoned off the stage. In its essence, b?tin, history is examination and verification of facts, exact investigation into their causes, pro found knowledge of how events hap pened and what their origin was. Thus history emerges as an important branch of philosophy.24 On the basis of source criticism, whose guiding principle is to measure the past by the present and to reject what experi ence shows to be impossible now, Ibn Khaldun arrives at a thorough analysis of the political organism; and he presents his results with equal emphasis on psy chological and historical fact. He lays bare the life-cycle of empires, from nomadism through conquest and subse quent corruption in urban life to decline and displacement from power. Civiliza tion presupposes urbanism, but city life leads to degeneracy, and the quest for an improved existence draws ever new waves of barbarian nomads into the eddy of acculturation, where their passionate solidarity feeling cools off, their cohesion weakens, and the very physical basis of their power is corroded. Three or perhaps four generations suffice to turn the wheel full circle. This neutral thesis is Islamicized by the 23 Cf. H. A. R. Gibb, "Al-M?ward?'s Theory of the Khil?fah," Islamic Culture, XI (1937), 291 302. 24 Muqaddima [i.e., Prolegomena], ed. Cairo, n.d., pp. 3-4; trans., I, 3-4.</page><page sequence="17">28 JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION recognition of the function of prophecy; for within the historical process man seeks salvation quite independently of the fate of his society. And it is the prophets whom God "has made to be means of access between Him and His creatures, that they may instruct men as to what is best for them, and may exhort them to accept their guidance, and may keep them from the Fire, and guide them in the way of salvation."25 A religious bond like the adherence to the same prophetic revelation will create the strongest pos sible solidarity feelings, so that groups united and prompted to aggressive action by a religious impulse will be most likely to enter successfully the cycle of empire building. Unless he were to reject it, the Muslim philosopher had to justify Revelation in the light of natural reason or else to ap praise reason by weighing its conclusions against the insights conveyed by the Koran. To test the two means of cognition by each other and to ascertain their com patibility or their complementary charac ter may have seemed a work of piety to the philosopher but actually was an en croachment on the autonomy of Revela tion and a switch to anthropocentrism, even if the result was a refusal to recog nize two independent truths based, re spectively, on faith and on reason. When Ibn Tuf ail (d. 1185), the contemporary and compatriot of Averro?s (d. 1198), demonstrates in his tale of Hayy b. Yaq z?n ("Alive, the Son of Awake") that an isolated human being by considering "philosophically" the world about him could, guided by reason alone, arrive at the verities guaranteed by Revelation, he not only brings down Revelation to the human level but voices a prouder view of man's potentialities than could be ac ceptable to the theologians. To conceive of Revelation as systematizing and verify ing the fundamental truths deducible from reasoned experience will deprive the incidental, the factual-historical, even much of the legal, content of the Book of its significance. As society largely de pends for its organization on this concrete and philosophically less relevant part of Revelation, philosophy will have to be come esoteric in order to eschew a hope less conflict. When Hayy toward the end of his life is found by the vizier of the neighboring king, he sails to the king's island to preach the pure faith but soon returns, having realized that the multi tude demands a sensuous adumbration of the truth rather than the truth itself. In the light of history, the tale?an elabo ration of an idea of Avicenna ( d. 1037 ), and probably one of the sources of De foe's Robinson Crusoe?comes to symbol ize the state of Muslim civilization as the Middle Ages draw to a close. Philos ophy reaches out far and high but is denied efficacy in its own society as Islam hardens and contracts to remain intact in the face of recession. The insights of the esoterics, smaller and smaller enclaves within a resurgent and zealous ortho doxy, and especially Averro?s' conception of Aristotelianism, are opened by trans lation to the West but put out of sight, not to say forgotten, in the East. Every civilization and every age favor a limited number of human types for whom they will provide the fullest means of self-realization, while denying it to an even larger number for whose peculiar gifts the prevailing pattern affords no socially meaningful use. The athlete and the rhetor, idolized in antiquity, are un known in Islam; the peasant, idealized by romanticism as the repository of genuine folk culture, is held in low esteem by Islam and never attracts the attention of the learned. Islam prefers the sedentary to the nomad, the city-dweller to the vil lager. It accepts the artisan but respects the merchant. The sword ranks lower than the pen. Religious knowledge is more desirable than wealth. Outside the circles of the canon lawyers, gnosis comes to be rated above rational knowledge. The prophet as the ideal head of the hier 25 Ed.

Power is fascinating and awesome but transient, the king and the officials a disturbing body in the peace-loving but war-ridden, industrious, and exploited community. The prevailing attitude toward power is skepticism. The caliph cUmar (634 44) begins a letter to his governor at Basra with the words: "People have an aversion from their rulers, and I trust to All?h that you and I are not overtaken by it, stealthily and unexpectedly, or by hatreds conceived against us."26 As an executive officer, the ruler is unrestricted. The absoluteness of his power was never challenged. The Muslim liked his rulers terror-inspiring, and it seems to have been bon ton to profess one's self awe-struck when ushered into their presence. "For in the grades of existence and the ranks of the intelligibles, after the Prophetic func tion, which is the supreme limit of man's attainment, there is no rank higher than kingship, which is naught else than a Divine gift."27 Ibn at-Tiqtaq? wrote in 1302: Know that a king has attributes peculiar to himself, which distinguish him from the commons. Amongst them is the fact that, when he likes a thing, the people like it, and when he dislikes a thing, the people dislike it, either naturally or so pretending thereby to curry favor with him. Hence the saying, "The people follow the faith of their rulers."... Another attribute peculiar to the ruler is that when he shows aversion from a man that man becomes faint-hearted, even though un damaged by him, and when he approaches a man that man is encouraged, even though unbenefited by him. Plain aversion or ap proach achieves that, and only a ruler has this attribute.28 The caliph Ma'm?n (813-33) is quoted as saying: "The best life has he who has an ample house, a beautiful wife, and sufficient means, who does not know us and whom we do not know." The medieval Muslim is not a citizen in the Greek or the post-Renaissance sense of the word. The vicissitudes of govern ment are his concern only when faith is at war with unbelief. He assumes no respon sibility for social or civic betterment be yond defraying his canonical obligations to the authorities and his fellow-men. He is frequently impatient with his rulers and thinks little of rioting, but on the whole he is content to let the princes play their game. During the reign of the Flavians (a.D. 70-96), Apollonius of Ty ana was accused by some of influencing the young to lead a retired life,20 and the same reproach was hurled against the Christians, but no Muslim ever was re buked for damaging the civic spirit. No Muslim government ever tried to develop civic sentiment. Accordingly, there was little attachment to the political body to which one happened to belong or for any particular regime (except on sectarian grounds). But there was an overwhelm ing feeling for the oneness of the Muslim community and a realization that any political sacrifice was justified to enable the community to continue under the Law as far as possible. Ghazz?l? says: There are those who hold that the imamate is dead, lacking as it does the required quali fications. But no substitute can be found for it. What then? Are we to give up obeying the law? Shall we dismiss the q?d?s, declare all authority to be valueless, cease marrying and pronounce the acts of those in hign places to be invalid at all points, leaving the populace to live in sinfulness? Or shall we continue as we are, recognizing that the imamate really exists and that all acts of the administration are valid, given the circum stances of the case and the necessities of the actual moment?30 26 Levy, op. cit., I, 283-84. 27Niz?m? cAr?d?

Grammati cal, philosophical, and historical ques tions were assured of wide interest. The relative rank of the major poets was hotly argued. The demand for polymathia, to gether with the accelerating accumula tion of material in all fields, created the need for scientific encyclopedias as well as for encyclopedias of the gentleman's knowledge that treated their subjects with the aid of illustrative verse, anec dotes, and apophthegms, provided the reader with quotable phrases, and at tempted to instruct while entertaining. Ibn Qutaiba (d. 889), the author of the cUy?n al-dkhb?r, or "Sources of Informa tion," one of the earliest specimens of the literary encyclopedia, devotes its ten sec tions to discussions of government, war, nobility, natural disposition and charac ter, learning and scholars, asceticism, so cial relations, human needs of all kinds, food, and women. He explains that he has dealt in separate books with drinks, the basic data of the sciences, poetry, and the interpretation of dreams. This is how Ibn Qutaiba characterizes the contents of the first section of the cUy?n: It contains the narratives about the station of government, the differences of its circum stances, its mode of life, the deportment the ruler stands in need of with regard to his companions; about his addresses, his transac tions, his consultations; the principles he has to adhere to in selecting his officials, judges, chamberlains, scribes and governors, in order that they may follow his ways in their deci sions. It also contains curious sayings and verses appropriate to these narratives. The whole work he has composed as "an eye-opener for the learned, as an educa tion for the leaders of men and those whom they lead, as a place for the kings to rest in from the toil of endeavor and weariness."31 When about one hundred years later the vizier Ibn Sacd?n (in office 983/4 985/6) asks the great litt?rateur Abu Hayy?n at-Tauh?d? (d. 1009) to spend his evenings in his company, they discuss such subjects as the condition of man, the nature of the soul, the character of impor tant contemporaries, the outstanding qualities of the Arabs as compared to other nationalities, the relative usefulness to the ruler of accountancy and stylistics, and the superiority of grammar over logic.32 At a later period mysticism would probably have figured prominently in their conversations. V As in its rise the political configuration of the period became significant only through the willingness of Islam to re spond, so in its decline did the barbarian invasions and usurpations succeed only because of the waning devotion to its original political ideal. The concept of the caliph as God's trustee and as the guar antor of a community life under God had ceased to rouse and rally the Muslims long before the Mongols conquered Baghdad and executed the last Abbasid caliph (a.D. 1258). Outside of Persia, which they never subjugated, the popu lation was only mildly interested when the Ottoman Turks displaced their rulers, who had for some time been mostly for eigners with more than a touch of the robber-baron. During the great age of Islam, Greek philosophy and Greek science had bat tered the walls of orthodoxy. Every ad vance in thought, in insight into the ways of nature, every effort devoted to accul turating and developing the offerings of classical antiquity, was at the very least energy withdrawn from the Law and pressure brought to bear on theology to catch up with the intellectual climate of the period so as to justify itself before the intellectual leadership. 31 Trans.

Economic stress, social injustice, and the appeal of Shfite ideology in its integration into Islam of pre-Islamic?Gnostic and ancient Near Eastern?ideas had put the Sunnite gov ernment on the defensive as early as the end of the ninth century. By the end of the eleventh the political situation of or thodoxy had become precarious. Emotion ally it lost its hold as the S?f?s emerged more and more as the bearers of the true religious life of the community. S?fism had become the repository of the religious psychology of Islam, and its analysis of the religious life the timeless enrichment of human self-interpretation and the most delicate crystallization of the Muslim's spiritual aspirations. Dogmatically dan gerous for its tendency toward a unio spiritualis between God and man, toward the ecstatic realization of a commingling of substances, divine and human, it was even more dangerous to the community by its implicit antinomianism?if the Law is not needed for union, why observe it after union has been attained? The quiet ist attitude of the mystics strengthened the antipolitieal outlook of the faith ful. Mysticism, as it had come to be the real religion of the Muslim world, gave final approval to that aversion from the political life and from civic education, to that defective, because actionless, hu manism which is far and away the most important single cause of the decay of Islamic civilization. Orthodoxy finally mastered the crisis. The Crusades ended sectarian expansion. The Ayyubids gave Egypt after two hun dred years its first Sunnite government ( a.D. 1171 ). Heterodox Persia broke away politically from the Arabic-speaking world. Defeats and calamities drew the people closer to tradition. The perfecting of scholasticism safeguarded the orthodox position in theology. The decomposing stimulus of Greek thought seemed no longer needed when its methodological contribution had been absorbed. The sciences receded under suspicion of here sy. The governments made ready to lend their arm to the orthodox reaction and assisted it through education and repres sion. What had been the caution of tradi tionalism became the rigor of fear and soon of death. The period knew that it was sterile and declining. Literary for malism and intellectual rigidity were to accommodate the unlettered, accom panied by hospitality to pre-Islamie pop ular beliefs, to the demoniacal world of Hellenistic magic as well as the worship of the S?f? saints. The theologians of the eleventh century, above all Ghazz?l?, se cured S?fism its place within orthodoxy. The S?f? yielded his antinomianism and accepted a definition of union that ruled out consubstantiality of man and God; the orthodox spiritualized ritual worship along the lines of mystic experience. The emotive life of Sunnite Islam came to be concentrated in the S?f? orders. The Turkish conquest (completed early in the sixteenth century) stabilized the political situation of the Near East. It cut off most of the Islamic area from Europe. Simultaneously, the shift of com merce from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic sealed the economic decline of the area that had, however, set in before the age of discoveries had reduced the value of the Muslim merchant's monopoly on the carrying trade between India and the West. One outburst of reforming primitivism, the Wahh?b? movement (from the middle of the eighteenth cen tury), broke the quiet of a sleepy age. The Arab countries especially that had been th? center of Muslim civilization submitted apathetically to the twin domi nation of orthodoxy and the Turks. It was only with Napoleon's expedition to Egypt (in 1798) that, through the impact of Europe and the rise of local nationalisms in its wake, Muslim civilization regained the willingness to change, to experiment, to risk?in short, to live.</page></plain_text>
