<plain_text><page sequence="1">"POETRY FOR THE WORLD OF READERS" AND "POETRY FOR BARDS PROPER": POETIC THEORY AND TEXTUAL INTEGRITY IN EMERSON'S PARNASSUS Ronald A. Bosco T HE SCHOLARLY AND CRITICAL ATTENTION directed toward the life, writing, and opinion of Ralph Waldo Emerson attests to the ingenuity of scholars and critics and the centrality of their subject to the evolution of letters and intellectual life in America. Yet one significant literary effort of Emerson's, an effort with which he was concerned for the greater part of his public career, is noteworthy for having received neither critical attention nor comment. The effort in question is Emerson's Parnassus, a substantial anthology of poems and poetic excerpts published late in 1874. Typically associated with Emerson's last years, years that have proven consistently troublesome to Emerson's biographers, editors, and critics, Parnassus shares with Society and Solitude (1870) and Letters and Social Aims (1876) in the disposition of most to ignore or, at best, take passing notice of their appearance and contents. This disposition is not completely unfair to Emerson, for as his biographers, James Elliot Cabot, Ralph L. Rusk, and Gay Wilson Allen have written, and as the editors of the now completed Emerson Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks and the in-progress Collected Works projects have suggested privately and in print, there is a definite problem in establishing the originality and dates of composition of many works and in recognizing Emerson's precise hand in and contribution to the arrangement of works included in these last volumes of his career. Although the problem is not particularly pressing with Society and Solitude, for in the late 1860s and in 1870 Emerson was still in fair control of his faculties and took an active part in all his business and literary affairs, it is quite pressing with Parnassus and Letters and Social Aims. By the mid-1870s, as the indisputable evidence of Emerson's recently published journals and pocket diaries of that period shows, Emerson was no longer able to exert complete, competent control over either his business or his literary affairs. Business affairs, including dealings with publishers over rights and fees, were increasingly entrusted during the 1870s 257</page><page sequence="2">258 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 to William Hathaway Forbes, Emerson's son-in-law. Literary endeavors, principally Parnassus and the mix of essays in Letters and Social Aims, had already become or quickly became collaborations. For many years before Parnassus was pub- lished Edith Emerson Forbes, Emerson's daughter, served as secretary and copyist for the volume; by 1874, as Emerson himself acknowledged, she had become a full-fledged collaborator, without whom the volume would never have appeared in print. With reluctance and occasional protest, Emerson found himself increasingly relying on another daughter, Ellen, for support in the organization and presentation of the few public lectures he gave during and after 1872, and by 1875 he had recruited her as collaborator on Letters and Social Aims.' Apart from the difficulty of distinguishing Emerson's part in his late lectures and in Parnassus and Letters and Social Aims from the part played by his daughters, two other difficulties present themselves to the editor or critic who would try to establish with confidence Emerson's precise contribution to these works: first, a significant portion of the manuscript material for all is either lost or in complete disarray, and, second, yet another hand was introduced in Emerson's literary affairs in 1875, when James Elliot Cabot became Emerson's literary executor and Ellen's co-collaborator on Letters and Social Aims. Cabot's presence at this juncture is finally more problematic for editorial reconstruction efforts on Letters and Social Aims than it is for serious study of Parnassus. Although it is true that Cabot visited with the Emerson family on Naushon Island in August 1874, when Edith and a severely impaired Emerson were putting the finishing touches on the Parnassus manuscript before sending it off to press, there is absolutely no evidence that he took an active part in the final preparation of the manuscript, and, of course, at that time he had no official (or unofficial) role in Emerson's literary affairs (see L-ETE, 2:140-42). Nevertheless, it is Cabot's concluding statement on Emerson's ultimate role in the composition and organization of Letters and Social Aims which has troubled all who have been concerned with that volume, and by implication should bother all concerned with Parnassus, published only a year before Emerson's final volume of essays. After describing the process whereby he and Ellen collected, connected, and ordered materials for the volume, Cabot wrote: "There is nothing here that he [that is, Emerson] did not write, and he gave full approval to whatever was done in the way of selection and arrangement; but I cannot say that he applied his mind very closely to the matter. He was pleased, in a general way, that the work should go on, but it may be a question exactly how far he sanctioned it" (W, 8:xiii). The essay that follows is an effort to establish Emerson's precise role in, contribution to, and purpose for Parnassus as a published volume that bears his name. Similar concerns touching Letters and Social Aims and Cabot's and Ellen's role in that volume have been admirably addressed by Nancy Craig Simmons in her recent essay, "Arranging the Sibylline Leaves: James Elliot Cabot's Work as</page><page sequence="3">Emerson's Parnassus 259 Emerson's Literary Executor." Answers to questions legitimately raised about Society and Solitude as well as lingering questions about specific essays in Letters and Social Aims will have to be postponed until the published judgment of those now engaged in researching and editing these texts appears.2 Concerning Parnas- sus, it is probably best to concede at the outset that owing to the generally undistinguished reputation of the volume, it has no claim on our attention comparable to that enjoyed by Emerson's other late works, and it will likely continue to have none in the absence of any clear sense of Emerson's long-term motives for his collection of poems. Lacking that clear sense, in 1887 Cabot gave only passing notice to the volume as an unfortunate production of Emerson's last years, stating, in his gracious way, that much was included in the volume by "accidental circumstance" rather than "upon a critical consideration" of merit (Memoir, 2:652-53). In 1949 Rusk concurred with Cabot's estimate: "The collection was by no means representative of Emerson's own best literary judgment, which he had outlived" (Life, p. 485). And most recently, Allen ignored Parnassus altogether. Beyond establishing Emerson's own role in Parnassus, a considerable portion of this essay is devoted to what I take to be an issue finally more important than the "history" of the volume. The issue is: what was Emerson's motive for collecting, arranging, and rewriting poems and poetic excerpts for the half- century before they were eventually printed in Parnassus? As I see it, Parnassus is much more than a mere anthology of memorable (and, admittedly, several less than memorable) poetic passages. It is a master poem of Emerson's own making, one intended in its representation of flashes of poetic genius for readers who, like Emerson, transcend the integrity and intention of individual poems and create for themselves a masterwork. This Emersonian elite is comprised of Emerson's ideal reader-bards. And the masterwork they create out of the shards of the great and not-so-great poetry of others discloses Emerson's chief article of artistic faith: Nature is the supereminent trope, the massive figure that reveals the inner workings of the poetic process, which is to say of spirit and of life itself. Read against "Poetry and Imagination," with which it shares a previously unstudied compositional history, Parnassus is a practical example of poetic theory expressed both in that essay and in the several lectures from which it was drawn. Read against "Quotation and Originality," a considerable number of poems and excerpts in Parnassus betray more convincingly than any prose examples from his work Emerson's application of the thoroughgoing, but previously thought theo- retical, metaphysical anthropomorphism revealed in "Poetry and Imagination" and in the "Preface" to Parnassus. Given Emerson's working definitions of "genius" and "originality" in "Quotation and Originality," many works in Parnas- sus stand as illustrations of a curious kind of poetic syncretism that raises important questions about inter-textuality and "textual integrity"-or, at least, about Emerson's view of the integrity and intention of individual poetic texts. In</page><page sequence="4">260 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 sum, Parnassus is Emerson's personal record as well as test of theories and assumptions concerning poetry evolved over years of reading and lecturing on poetry before audiences and, of course, of reading poetry for himself. Taken as a whole, Parnassus is Emerson's masterwork that elucidates and confirms his own peculiar "rule" concerning poetry: there is "a poetry for bards proper, as well as a poetry for the world of readers" (P, p. vi). I Long before Emerson confided his reason for Parnassus in Journal ST (1870- 77)-"I wish a volume on my own table that shall have nothing that is not poetry" (JMN, 16:224)-he had begun to collect, organize, and, in some cases, rewrite whole poems and verse excerpts that eventually were included in that volume. Emerson's habit of collecting poems and verse snippets is said by Rusk to have begun in 1822, when he received from Aunt Mary Moody Emerson "a sweet morsel of Hindu poetry." Emerson copied the "sweet morsel," a slightly inaccu- rate translation of lines 8-17 of"A Hymn to Narayena," into Journal Wide World 6 (1822) and in time reproduced the entire poem in Parnassus from a translation by Sir William Jones (L, 1:116n; JMN, 1:153-54; P, p. 180). In fact, the relation between Emerson's early transcription of Aunt Mary's lines and their appearance in Parnassus is by no means unique. We know today that throughout his student years at Harvard and during the early years of his teaching and ministerial careers Emerson was fond of recording in journals and notebooks verses from classic and contemporary poets and from known or anonymous balladeers which appealed to him for their "magic of style," "melody," or "heroic thought" (P, pp. iv, vi). Many pages of Emerson's College Theme Book (1819-21, 1822?, 1823, 1829?), Journals Wide World 1 (1820), 2 (1820-21), 3 (1822), and 4 (1822), Notebooks No. XVII (1820) and No. XVIII (1820-22), and Notebooks Universe 6 (1821), 7 (1821), 7[A] (1822), and 8 (1822) are filled with lines in whole or in part from poetic works by, among others, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, Milton, Knowles, Jonson, Pope, Cowper, Congreve, Thomson, Wordsworth, Scott, Byron, and Bryant. All of these poets were eventually represented in Parnassus, and some of their lines, which Emerson entered into notebooks before he entered those from Aunt Mary, had such appeal that a half-century later he included them in Parnassus. For instance, along with ballads preserved by Scott and the "Song of the Tonga Islanders," which appear both in the earlyjournals and notebooks and in Parnassus, lines 895-906 of Spenser's "Prosopopoia: or Mother Hubberds Tale," copied into Universe 6 as "Spenser's lamentation," appear in Parnassus as "Spenser at Court" (JMN, 1:380; P, p. 267); lines 717-28 of "Spring" from Thomson's The Seasons, copied into Universe 6 as "The Nightingale," appear in Parnassus as "Nightingale" (JMN, 1:380; P, p. 34); lines 229-38 from Jonson's The Gypsies Metamorphosed, copied into Notebook No. XVII, Universe</page><page sequence="5">Emerson's Parnassus 261 6, and Wide World 4, appear in Parnassus as part of a larger "Song from Gypsies' Metamorphoses" (JMN, 1:104, 224-25, 381-82; P, pp. 125-26); twelve untitled lines from Congreve's The Mourning Bride (II, i, 48-59), copied into Universe 5, appear, slightly expanded, in Parnassus as "Cathedral" (JMN, 1:375; P, p. 133); and Bryant's "To a Waterfowl," copied in full into Universe 8, appears in full in Parnassus (JMN, 1:392-93; P, pp. 37-38). A survey of the JMN indicates beyond doubt that during the fifty years that separate his early verse entries in journals and notebooks from the appearance of Parnassus Emerson continued to quote and requote from these writers and to add many new poets and poetic excerpts along the way. By 1850 he appears to have decided to organize his many selections and snippets into a volume of collected verse, for under the heading "Poetry" in Journal AZ (1849-50) he reminded himself to "insert from Ben Jonson's Works" in "Selection of Poems" (JMN, 11:269), and several of Jonson's poems identified there do, in fact, appear in Parnassus." However, professional and political activities for the next several years left Emerson little time for any concerted effort on his intended volume. Between 1850 and 1856, he published Representative Men (1850) and English Traits (1856), carried on a busy lecture schedule, and lent his support to the abolitionist cause. Finally, in 1856 or 1857, it was Edith, not her father, who found the time and provided the necessary impetus to get the project moving forward. Ellen, writing to Lily Ward von Hoffmann shortly before Parnassus appeared in 1874, offers in retrospect valuable details of Emerson's own long-term commitment to the project and of Edith's willingness early on to serve as her father's secretary- collaborator: [Edith] and Father have at last sent "Parnassus" to the publishers. I don't remember whether I ever told you about the book. Father always had an intention of making a collection of poetry very strictly selected, and used to talk with Edith about it when she was a little girl. She became very much interested and saw that Father hadn't time to copy himself, so when she was fifteen she began to do it, and has never given it up. She has regularly seized his leisure moments and made him look up and mark what he wanted copied, and has done mountains of writing..... This has been going on now seventeen years and at last the work is done. (L-ETE, 2:151) As Ellen notes, Parnassus was ultimately a long way off in the mid-1850s, and probably neither Edith nor Emerson foresaw that the volume would take nearly an additional two decades to complete. Between the late-1850s and the late- 1860s Edith periodically copied marked verse passages from her father's journals and notebooks into "Parnassus," an unpublished 152-page notebook which has survived, and onto loose manuscript sheets, many of which have been lost. Then, perhaps infected by Edith's enthusiasm, shortly after the publication of May-Day and Other Pieces in 1867, Emerson turned to the Parnassus project in earnest. In</page><page sequence="6">262 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 Journals LN (1866-68) and NY (1868-70) and in Pocket Diary 19 (1868) he began to make lists of works, authors, and unspecified or untitled lines to be included in the volume, and he expanded those lists considerably in the opening pages of Journal ST (1870-77) and Pocket Diary 22 (1871). In addition to these journals and pocket diaries, Emerson also kept two still-unpublished notebooks that include material for Parnassus: "Parnassus Scraps," a now-mutilated thirty-two- page notebook which bears early dates (17 February-4 July 1824) and contains two minimal entries relating to Parnassus, and PY, subtitled "Theory of Poetry" by Emerson, a 291-page notebook which dates from the late-1860s to the early- 1870s and contains transcriptions of many poems for Parnassus as well as of material incorporated into "Poetry and Imagination." Finally, to Edith's collec- tion of loose manuscript sheets, which she entitled "Parnassus Scraps &amp; Copy," Emerson added many loose sheets of his own, which he likely tore out of his regular journals and notebooks.4 Intending to finish and publish Parnassus in 1871, Emerson entered into an agreement with James R. Osgood &amp; Co. for publication of the volume. With Edith he set to the task of arranging his copious notes and selections into order, working steadily on the manuscript between April and July 1871. In April and May, during the excursion west hosted by John Murray Forbes, they carried on their effort in railroad cars and hotel rooms. In June and July, Emerson, back in Concord, put the finishing touches on the manuscript, which then consisted exclusively of poems and excerpts arranged in various categories, with the assistance of Edith and another copyist, Elizabeth Weir (L, 6:170). Evidence of Emerson's and Edith's intense effort on Parnassus at this time is preserved in several letters from the period. On 11 June, for instance, Emerson asked Ellen to tell Edith, "I get on with the book, which appears to be good, or certainly her work does her honor" (L, 6:163). Three days later, he wrote hurriedly to Edith to inquire after a lost bundle of manuscripts for the book: "What has become of all or most of the Shakspeare Selections? They do not appear in the portfolio I brought from your house. . . . I hope they are safe in your closets." Missing along with the Shakspeare material were some selections from Herbert, so an anxious Emerson concluded, "If you can find any of these refugees, send them ... &amp; if not I will pick out the must bes from Shakspeare himself' (L, 6:164). Finally, on 18 July, he wrote to Edith to excuse himself from attending her scheduled family outing to Naushon Island, but reported the happy news: "I think we have pretty nearly finished the bundle of paper ... so that it may go to Mr. Osgood next week" (L, 6:170). After depositing the manuscript with Osgood sometime in early August, Emerson did not hear from his publisher for nearly a month, but Edith did. Knowing of her involvement with the volume, Osgood sought her support for his idea that "the selections [in Parnassus] be strung on a thread of criticism or essay," which, as in its final, published version, the volume then lacked. He argued, "the</page><page sequence="7">Emerson's Parnassus 263 book would be tenfold more valuable if this plan were carried out," and offered to delay publication for up to a year so that the work could be done (Osgood to Edith Emerson Forbes, paraphrased by Rusk in L, 6:172-73n). Edith agreed with Osgood. Emerson, who knew nothing of the plan until 3 September, acquiesced, observing wryly, "Osgood is thinking mainly ... of his copyright, which he thinks would be good for little in our present form" (L, 6:172-73, 176). On 6 September, he confided to Edith, "reprieve is always welcome to me, &amp; I am sure the book will gain much by it, even if it should not gain the amount of critical matter which he [Osgood] desires-making criticism the pudding, &amp; poetry the plums. It certainly is in a state of order &amp; ripeness now, that, I doubt, we should soon miss if we insisted on printing." He closed, thanking her for her dedication to Parnassus: "But it is wonderful that you can care for this book,-to have worked so thoughtfully &amp; perseveringly on it &amp; for it ... surely this book is bound to be good" (L, 6:176-77). Despite the year's delay agreed upon by Emerson and Osgood which would have placed publication of Parnassus late in 1872, the Printers' Circular and Stationers' and Booksellers' Gazette for October 1871 announced Emerson's Poetical Hand-Book for Scholars and Students as forthcoming that year (DB, p. 748). It is unlikely, however, that either Emerson or Edith returned to the Parnassus manuscript between September 1871 and February 1872. Edith and her husband had increasing domestic and business responsibilities to turn to, which she, at least, had neglected in the rush to complete the manuscript during the previous spring and summer, and Emerson was busy on the lecture circuit, speaking in Illinois and Iowa in November and December and in Maryland, Washington, D.C., New York, and New Jersey in January. In February 1872, obviously distressed by Emerson's lack of progress, Osgood offered this incentive, should the volume with the called-for narrative be finished in timely fashion: a $500 bonus on the day of publication, plus a five-percent royalty on the retail price of each copy sold (see Life, p. 451). The offer apparently caught Emerson's attention, for during the six private "conversations" he gave at Mechanics' Hall in Boston between 15 April and 20 May 1872, Emerson read extensively from poems that he intended to include in Parnassus. In Journal ST, where he outlined the lecture course, he added readings from, for instance, Thoreau's "Inspiration," Helen Hunt's "Thought" and "Joy," William Stroude's "On Music," David Lewis' "Lines to Alexander Pope," "The Song of the Tonga Islanders," and various pieces of Wordsworth, Byron, and Henry Timrod to the lectures "Books" (15 April), "Poetry &amp; Imagination" (23 and 30 April), and "Criticism" (6 May). Sometime after he read them at Mechanics' Hall, Emerson checked off the relevant poems added to the lecture outlines and noted, "All these marked are now inserted in Parnassus" (JMN, 16:272-73). Because all of the poems read during the Mechanics' Hall series are included in earlier lists of materials for Parnassus, it is uncertain how much poetry, if any,</page><page sequence="8">264 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 Emerson intended to add to the existing manuscript. Except for the argument advanced in section II below, there is no evidence that he attempted to prepare the agreed-upon critical narrative for the volume in the first half of 1872, and events in Emerson's life after July 1872 would argue against his inclination or ability to undertake that responsibility ever again. For on 24 July 1872, Emerson's house was substantially damaged by fire, the short-range effect of which was to break his inclination to write, while the long-range effect was to accelerate the progress of what might today be diagnosed as senilia dementia. The Parnassus manuscript was one of the items rescued by friends and neighbors from the fire, but between late 1872 and the publication of the volume two years later Emerson's heart was not completely with the project. He returned to making lists for the volume in Pocket Diary 23 (1872), but added nothing not already contained in earlier lists. As on his journey west in 1871, he brought portions of the manuscript to read during his recuperative journey with Ellen to Europe and Egypt in 1872-73. Yet neither Pocket Diary 24 (1873) nor portions of Journal ST that contain entries for 1873 indicate that he returned to the project in earnest. As much for Edith's sake as for his own and out of a sense that he owed Osgood the book, early in 1874 Emerson husbanded his declining powers so that Parnassus, in whatever shape, could finally be put into print. In Pocket Diary 25 (1874) and Journal ST entries for 1874 he reproduced segments of earlier Parnassus lists with their then very familiar poets and titles. By 29 August, after a hectic month at Naushon working with Edith, he advised Osgood that prepara- tion of the manuscript was far enough along to plan for publication in early December (L, 6:263; L-ETE, 2:140-42). Emerson spent most of early September once again reviewing the plan of the volume and double checking contents, both with Edith's assistance, and then deposited the poetry sections of the manuscript with Osgood, who immediately began setting it in type. During the second week of September Emerson drafted portions of the "Preface" and copied several mottoes from Journal ST into a brief untitled manuscript for use as section- headings in Parnassus (JMN, 16:309-12).5 On 1 November, he signed a new contract with Osgood which called for Emerson to retain the copyright on the book and to pay for and retain the plates (DB, p. 699). Writing to Edith on 3 November, Ellen reported, "Father exclaimed yesterday'Correcting these proofs is work that pays well. Selections made long ago, and forgotten, keep rising, each as fresh as a star.' He is proud of the book" (L-ETE, 2:148). Sometime later that month Emerson wrote to Edith to say, "I am correcting the 202d printed page of Parnassus, &amp; Osgood told me today it will all be printed in a fortnight; &amp; asks if the preface will then be ready? Which may the Muses grant!" (L, 6:267). Finally, on 18 December 1874, the volume was advertised in the Boston Daily Advertiser as "Ready Tomorrow," and within a day Parnassus, with a brief preface of little more than eight pages and poetic selections running to more than five hundred</page><page sequence="9">Emerson's Parnassus 265 pages, appeared (DB, p. 699). In gratitude and appreciation, Emerson gave the first press copy of Parnassus to Edith. On the day of publication, he had copies sent to more than fifty relatives and friends, many of whom responded kindly to the gift (see Life, p. 485; JMN, 16:305-307). Oliver Wendell Holmes, for instance, wrote on 19 December, thanking him for the "large and costly volume" and congratulating him on the use of his special "divining-rod" in making selections. Holmes pledged a careful reading of the whole book: "I have already found many of my favorites, and the difference between this and any other of the numerous collections I have is that if I do not at first like what has pleased you ... I shall look more nicely to see whether I am not at fault" (L, 6:267-68n). Longfellow wrote twice, first on 23 December 1874, and then on 24 January 1876, to offer thanks and praise (L, 6:268n). Yet, though many years in the making and its publication a great relief to Emerson, Parnassus in print contained a more than usual share of flaws and was by no means greeted with universal approbation. In fact, on 15 December 1874, four days before Parnassus appeared, Emerson began his own list of corrections and additions "for any second Edition" (Life, p. 486; JMN, 16:313-15). Negative reactions to Parnassus centered on two concerns: (1) numerous errors in texts and in the attribution of selections, and (2) the apparently idiosyncratic process of selection represented by the editor's choice of poets to include in-or, just as often, to exclude from-the volume. Emerson, once again, anticipated the first problem and was prepared to deal with it. Offering no excuses based on age, health, or the rush he was in to complete the manuscript, he dutifully noted in Journal ST and the presently unpublished Notebook QL ("Queries on Literature") all corrections for spelling, punctuation, and attribution as they came to his attention. He acknowledged, for instance, James Freeman Clarke's objection that poems credited to him were not, in fact, his, and he recorded George H. Vibbert's extensive catalogue of errata. At times Emerson reminded himself to look into passages from Donne, Bishop Berkeley, Burns, and others which had been unintentionally omitted from the printed book, but for reasons that will be advanced below, he was probably not too impressed by the correction of "corrupt" Shakespeare texts insisted upon by William Rolfe, who was then editing Shakespeare anew (see Life, pp. 485-86; JMN, 16:316-18). Complaints about his apparently idiosyncratic process of selection would have been much more difficult to deal with had Emerson been willing to consider them. Given his statement years before that Parnassus "shall hold the best poems of all my Poets" (emphasis added), it is unlikely Emerson ever would have conceded that his choice of materials was a matter of concern to anyone other than himself. In the "Preface" to Parnassus he reaffirmed that early bias, saying that the book evolved as a "convenience," "commanding all my favorites in one album," and that in preparing the volume for publication he operated under "the belief that what charmed me probably might charm others" (P, p. iii). And</page><page sequence="10">266 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 whether or not it was intentional, Emerson effectively undermined the claims of objectors when he provided his own measure of Parnassus against the value of comparable anthologies then in print: I know the convenience and merits of the existing anthologies, and the necessity of printing in every collection many masterpieces which all English-speaking men have agreed in admiring. Each has its merits; but I have found that the best of these collections do not contain certain gems of pure lustre, whilst they admit many of questionable claim. The voluminous octavos of Anderson and Chalmers have the same fault of too much mass and too little genius; and even the more select "Golden Treasury" of Mr. Palgrave omits too much that I cannot spare. I am aware that no two readers would make the same selection. Of course, I shall gladly hail with the public a better collection than mine. (P, p. iii) On the surface, there appears very little in Parnassus to which nineteenth- or twentieth-century readers might object. Many of the poems and poets repre- sented in the volume duplicate those contained in the popular anthologies to which Emerson refers above and anticipate the canonical collections ofverse read today. Though Rolfe challenged Emerson's texts, neither he nor any sensible reader should have taken exception to the space Emerson gave to Shakespeare, whose selections outnumber those of the nearest rival two-to-one and whom Emerson credits in the "Preface" as "an exceptional mind in the world," the originator of "a universal poetry [that] began and ended with him" (P, p. v). Chaucer is similarly well-represented and praised. Though his selections are not as numerous as Shakespeare's, many run to several hundred lines. Speaking to the value of Chaucer for the nineteenth-century reader, Emerson cautioned that "[his] antiquity ought not to take him out of the hands of intelligent readers. No lover of poetry can spare him." Chaucer, he argued, "has lines of more force than any English writer, except Shakespeare .... He is always strong, facile, and pertinent, and with what vivacity of style through all the range of his pictures, comic or tragic! He knows the language of joy and of despair" (P, p. v). Even Wordsworth, about whom Emerson often recorded mixed appraisals, received fair treatment and representation. Wordsworth, who came in second to Shakespeare, is represented by more than forty selections in Parnassus, which should have pleased most. In the "Preface," Emerson repeated his old conten- tions that Wordsworth was "encumbered for years with childish [egotistical] whims" and that "[his] early poems were written on a false theory of poetry," but on balance, he observed, Wordsworth was the type for those "poets who rose slowly, and wrote badly, and yet had a true calling, and, after a hundred failures, arrived at pure power." In Wordsworth's case, "religious insight, lifted [him] to genius" (P, pp. iv, vii). In fact, Emerson's negative judgments on Wordsworth in the "Preface" are mild in comparison to those he made in the privacy of his journals, where at the time he was preparing Parnassus for the press, he</page><page sequence="11">Emerson's Parnassus 267 commented: "The vice of Wordsworth is that he is a lame poet: he can rarely finish worthily a stanza begun well. He suffers from asthma of the mind" (JMN, 16:244). Along with Shakespeare, Chaucer, and Wordsworth, over one hundred other major English and American poets were represented in Parnassus. Emerson included a healthy share of seventeenth-century metaphysical and religious poetry, eighteenth-century decorous and satirical verse, and nineteenth-century popular poetry from both sides of the Atlantic. Mixed in with masterpieces from Donne, Milton, Jonson, Crashaw, Pope, Swift, Byron, Tennyson, Bryant, Long- fellow, and Whittier, for example, were selections from the humorous and sentimental verse of Burns, Clough, James Russell Lowell, Holmes, and the columns of the London Punch. Included too were more than one-hundred-fifty pages of narrative poems, ballads, and songs drawn principally from Robert Jamieson's Popular Ballads and Songs from Tradition, Manuscripts, and Scarce Editions (1806), Scott's Minstrelsy ofthe Scottish Border (1810), R. A. Smith's The Scottish Minstrel (n.d.), and Francis James Child's English and Scottish Ballads (1857) (see JMN, 16:222n). Emerson included too poets of his own day whose reputations were not nearly as secure then as they are now: Robert Browning, Coventry Patmore, and Bret Harte, for instance. Finally, Parnassus offered the reader inspirational verse by Isaac Watts, John Wesley, and Fanny Kemble; patriotic verse by Grenville Mellen and Julia Ward Howe; and popular trade verse by Sarah Hammond Palfrey, Jean Ingelow, Nathaniel Parker Willis, Julia Caroline Ripley Dorr, and others. What is there in Parnassus then that met with disapproval and engendered hard feelings in Emerson's day and about which one might legitimately raise questions today? First, there is the issue of poems and poets deliberately omitted from the volume by Emerson. Among the most glaring omissions are the poems of Shelley, Poe, Whitman, any American poet before 1800, and Emerson himself. Though Shelley was finally represented by two short excerpts in the second edition of Parnassus, there is cause to wonder how Emerson could have ignored Poe or Whitman in either edition, despite his own prejudices against them. Both poets had a following, of course, and though Poe was dead, a yet-alive Whitman, who in 1855 had answered Emerson's call for an American poet, could feel the smart-and did. As for American writers of the colonial and early national periods, Emerson had access to the poems of Anne Bradstreet, Cotton Mather, Mather Byles, and Michael Wigglesworth, and not all are so tainted by the fulsome Calvinism about which Emerson often complained that they could not have been included in sections of inspirational and religious poetry. Similarly, sections dealing with patriotic or pastoral poetry ought to have been appropriate places to reproduce selected pieces from the Connecticut Wits or Philip Freneau, all of which were within easy reach. Without explanation, Emerson elected to ignore these writers, and in their place he included a number of "new poets," poets who "have yet to earn their</page><page sequence="12">268 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 laurels" but whose verses, as he wrote about one of them, have a "rare merit of thought and expression, and will reward the reader for the careful attention they require" (P, p. x). Among Emerson's new poets were Mrs. Cecil Francis Alexander, Henry Howard Brownell, William Ellery Channing (the younger), James Freeman Clarke, Ellen Sturgis Hooper ("E. S. H." in Parnassus), Lucy Larcom, Helen Hunt ("H. H."), F.B. Sanborn, Edmund Clarence Stedman, Caroline Sturgis Tappan ("C. S. T."), Henry Timrod, Jones Very, Samuel Gray Ward ("S. G. W"), and Byron Forceythe Willson. Some of these new poets were friends, particularly Channing, Clarke, Hooper, Sanborn, Tappan, and Ward; some, especially Channing and Very, had already benefitted from Emerson's encouragement and careful reading of their poetry. Some, namely Brownell, Timrod, and Willson, were already dead; one, Very, had already been institution- alized for a severe psychological disorder; and another, Stedman, was already content with his reputation as literary critic, not as poet. So, Emerson's "new poets" constituted an odd lot indeed. Except, possibly, Jones Very, none, according to the standards of literary criticism current then or now, has yet a claim on us to share in Emerson's unqualified admiration of his or her "rare merit." Nevertheless, Emerson put his judgment on the line by including these writers in Parnassus, championing their art against the criteria that most other antholo- gizers of the period, who tended to exclude them, typically applied. Interestingly, Emma Lazarus, a genuine new poet, was conspicuous by her absence from Parnassus. Once encouraged in her craft by Emerson, she protested her exclusion from Parnassus, but to no avail (L, 6:296n; JMN, 16:xv). Remarking on the success of Society and Solitude, Emerson wrote: "My new book sells faster ... [than] its foregoers. This is not for its merit, but only shows that old age is a good advertisement. Your name has been seen so often that your book must be worth buying" (JMN, 16:175). This attitude, expressed in 1870, may approximate his unrecorded response to the reception of Parnassus in 1874-75. For despite its flawed texts and curious omissions and inclusions, Parnassus was at once a literary and a financial success. Most joined Holmes and Longfellow in praising Emerson's selections, and no one seemed really to mind Emerson's highly judgmental remarks in the "Preface" on, say, Montaigne's or Byron's "egotism" or "the superficial melody" of Thomas Moore's poems (P, pp. iv, vii). On 30 January 1875, slightly more than a month after Parnassus first appeared, a second edition "with numerous corrections and revisions" was advertised in Publishers' Weekly, and it was brought out shortly thereafter (DB, p. 699). Though not all textual flaws were corrected in the new edition and though in it, except for Shelley, earlier omissions stood, this first printing of the second edition sold out quickly, so that reprints proved a profitable enough venture for the publishers in 1876, 1878, 1880, 1881, 1882, and 1884. In all formats, as Myerson reports, 8,300 copies of Parnassus were sold between 1874 and 1923, a certain tribute to Emerson's appeal both before and after his death in 1882 (DB, p. 700).</page><page sequence="13">Emerson's Parnassus 269 The fact that within nine months of its initial publication Parnassus had earned him $1,000 probably made that tribute all the more tangible for Emerson. II Under no circumstances should Parnassus be dismissed as an isolated, collabo- rative, or accidental effort on Emerson's part. An effort with which Emerson was involved throughout his public career, Parnassus took shape in his mind and writings for more than a half-century; as published, it represents at a minimum an extended statement of personal judgment and taste: it is Emerson's own cumulative poetic copybook. Given his extensive lists for Parnassus in journals and notebooks and Ellen's statement in 1874 to Lily von Hoffmann concerning Edith's role in preparing the edition, it is apparent that Edith was primarily a secretary and copyist, helping her father collate old lists and collect whole poems and verse excerpts in order to organize and arrange what amounted to fifty years' worth of personal collection and preference. Thus, Parnassus, in regard to both the choice of what appeared and the manner in which texts were reproduced in the volume, was principally Emerson's alone. Not only did he intend Parnassus as an opportunity to share his favorite poems and poets with the public, but also he intended the volume as an exemplar for theories of poetry and of the role of the poet in society which he evolved in lectures, journal and notebook entries, and published essays over the years. Further, the texts as they stand in Parnassus, whether absolutely faithful reproductions of their sources or "flawed" to the extent that they represent revisions, corruptions, or complete reorderings of their sources, appear deliberately as Emerson's means of demonstrating and verifying his theories. Edward Wagenknecht is among the few who have taken any significant notice of Parnassus, but his observation that the "Preface" to Parnassus is Emerson's most important late-in-life statement of beliefs about literature is, unfortunately, misleading.6 In fact, the poetic theory expressed in the "Preface" and the editorial method carried out in the preparation and presentation of texts in Parnassus have their origin in certain of Emerson's long-held practices and beliefs. These receive their fullest prose expression in two essays published in Letters and Social Aims: "Poetry and Imagination" and "Quotation and Originality." When they appeared in 1876, as Edward Waldo Emerson later noted, neither essay was particularly new. "Poetry and Imagination," for instance, had among its sources various lectures, including "The Poet" (1841), "Poetry and Eloquence" (1847), "Poetry and English Poetry" (1854), "Poetry and Criticism in England and America" (1861), and the aforementioned double-lecture "Poetry &amp; Imagination" (W, 8:357-58). Other lecture sources for "Poetry and Imagination" not noted by Edward Emerson include, possibly, "Poetry and Criticism" (1868), which is not preserved but is the likely source for an essay of the same title set in proof in 1871-</page><page sequence="14">270 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 72 but not published (see note 8 below), and, definitely, "Imagination" (1870 and 1871). Finally, not based on collective wisdom equal to that incorporated into "Poetry and Imagination," "Quotation and Originality" was taken almost entirely from Emerson's 1859 lecture "Originality" (W, 8:358). Although it is not my purpose in this essay to relate the entire pre-publication history of "Poetry and Imagination," certain aspects of that ultimately tortured history are important to note, particularly those that relate directly to my belief that between September 1871 and the early months of 1872 Emerson made a conscious decision to use "Poetry and Imagination" as the "connecting narrative" for Parnassus. Significant for the argument that follows is that the timing for such a decision makes perfect sense: on the one hand, selections for Parnassus and the arrangement of texts in various divisions were largely completed in August 1871, when Emerson sent the manuscript to Osgood; on the other hand, Osgood's request for a "connecting narrative" reached Emerson just when he had at his disposal the collection of lectures noted above in which, clearly, he had been progressively developing a large statement on poetics.7 Despite the generally held belief among Emerson editors and critics that "Poetry and Imagination" was not completed until 1875, when Cabot and Ellen were collaborating on Letters and Social Aims, more than sufficient evidence exists to prove that "Poetry and Imagination" as printed was substantially com- pleted by Emerson alone at about the time of the "Poetry &amp; Imagination" lectures in April 1872 and that at the time of the lectures Emerson definitely conceived of the essay as having a significant connection with Parnassus. In his edition of Emerson's Works, Edward Emerson stated that "Poetry and Imagination" "seems to have been brought by Mr. Emerson to its present size and form when, under the final title 'Poetry and Imagination,' he read it, as two lectures ... in April, 1872" (W, 8;358; emphasis added). Yet what Edward only assumed can be all but conclusively established today by collective reference to the following preserved manuscripts: (1) "Parnassus Scraps &amp; Copy." Referred to in section I above as a principal source of poems and excerpts for Parnassus, this large manuscript was kept by Emerson and Edith from, roughly, 1855 to 1871. It was used during the last months of their preparation of the manuscript for Osgood in 1871 and was probably the "portfolio" Emerson referred to in his 14 June 1871 letter to Edith. Important for the present consideration is that among this manuscript's loose sheets of poetry and excerpts are many sheets of prose in Emerson's hand. Although their origin is not indicated anywhere in the manuscript, they include the entire "Imagination" section of "Poetry and Imagination" (preserved as a discrete unit and written almost exactly as it appears in the essay) and several separate paragraphs of miscellaneous material incorporated into other sections of the essay. In the margins of several sheets of prose and verse, Emerson marked material as read in "lecture VII" of his Harvard series on "Natural History of the</page><page sequence="15">Emerson's Parnassus 271 Intellect" (26 April-2 June 1870). (2) "Imagination." Not to be confused with the "Imagination" section of "Poetry and Imagination," "Imagination," a lecture manuscript entirely in Emer- son's hand, was read at Harvard on 10 May 1870 as the seventh in his series of sixteen lectures on "Natural History of the Intellect" and again at Harvard on 28 February 1871 as the fifth lecture in his seventeen-lecture reprise of the 1870 series. Poetry identified in the margins of"Parnassus Scraps &amp; Copy" as read in "lecture VII" appears as "Readings" throughout; however, very little of the "Imagination" section of "Poetry and Imagination," which is preserved in "Par- nassus Scraps &amp; Copy," was used in the lecture. Instead, in "Imagination" Emerson read from a sub-section entitled "Veracity" in the lecture, and it is almost identical to the "Veracity" section of the essay. Additionally, several sheets of the lecture marked "Duplicate" by Emerson bear prose incorporated into various other sections of "Poetry and Imagination." (3) "Poetry &amp; Imagination." The manuscript of Emerson's double-lecture on 23 and 30 April 1872 is entirely in his hand and, in fact, includes as "Readings" much Parnassus material beyond that noted above in section I. Also included in the lectures are substantial portions of both the "Veracity" and the "Bards and Trouveurs" sections of "Poetry and Imagination." Finally, several sheets of the lecture marked "Duplicate" by Emerson bear prose incorporated into various other sections of the essay; most of these duplicate sheets contain matter included in "Imagination." (4) A fair copy of an untitled and undated manuscript almost entirely in Emerson's hand which provided Cabot and Ellen with the text of "Poetry and Imagination." This manuscript was obviously drawn from items 1, 2, and 3 above and the lectures mentioned by Edward Emerson in his Works note. To the extent that a writer's penmanship-style can be used to date a manuscript, I would hazard that Emerson wrote this manuscript sometime between 1870 and the first half of 1872. Emerson's penmanship exhibits a marked deterioration between 1870-72 and 1874 and after, as evidenced by comparisons between items 1, 2, and 3 above taken together with contemporaneous entries by Emerson in journals, notebooks, and pocket diaries and the miscellaneous "Parnassus" manuscript noted in section I which Emerson used in 1874 to draft parts of the "Preface" to Parnassus and entries by Emerson in journals, notebooks, and pocket diaries in 1874 and after. Emerson's handwriting throughout the body of this manuscript places it squarely in the earlier of the two periods. The manuscript bears minimal evidence of revision, suggesting that it repre- sented for Emerson a fair and relatively final draft of "Poetry and Imagination." Throughout there are directions in Emerson's hand for a printer, and across the top of the first page of the manuscript the following is inserted by Emerson in the jagged penmanship that marks his writing during 1874 and after: "Copy for Lectters [sic] Social Aims." This insertion was probably made in 1875, when</page><page sequence="16">272 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 Emerson was passing material to Cabot and Ellen for Letters and Social Aims; given what we know now of the state of Emerson's mind at the time, "Lectters" in the insertion most likely indicates his inadvertent, but understandable, confu- sion between the lectures that the manuscript in part once represented and the essay it would become in Letters and Social Aims. Significantly, half-way through the manuscript Emerson wrote the following in the margin in a hand that resembles his during the earlier period described above: "Read at Mechanics' Hall. Apr. 22 '72," but the part so marked is not included in the manuscript of the lectures described in item 2. This telling bit of marginalia suggests to me that Emerson may have enlarged the lectures by reading from this manuscript; if he in fact did so, then the manuscript would have had to have been in a fair state of completion by April 1872.8 Although no one of these items absolutely makes the case that at some point between September 1871 and the early months of 1872 Emerson decided to use "Poetry and Imagination" as his "connecting narrative" for Parnassus, collectively they point to that conclusion. Without even considering the evidence of item 4, by September 1871, when Osgood requested a narrative, Emerson had at his disposal fair drafts of more than half of the material included in "Poetry and Imagination"; given the extensive additional sources from which he drew the essay, it is conceivable that he spent the early months of 1872 completing the manuscript identified as item 4. In this connection it is important to notice too that as segments of "Poetry and Imagination" were drafted in lectures, Parnassus material was acknowledged by Emerson as "Readings" in those lectures. As mentioned earlier, Parnassus material was included not only in the "Poetry &amp; Imagination" lectures but also in the "Books" and "Criticism" lectures at Mechan- ics' Hall. Additionally, in Journals LN, NY, and ST and in unpublished Notebooks LO, ZO, QL, and PY, which collectively date from late 1850s to mid-1870s, Emerson increasingly connected growing Parnassus lists with passages in which he was drafting portions of "Poetry and Imagination." Although there is evidence of this practice as early as 1866, the practice is most noticeable in journal and notebook entries from 1869 to 1872 (see, for instance, JMN, 16:48-49, 108, 117- 18, 266ff). Among Emerson's works "Poetry and Imagination" has a compositional history second in longevity only to Parnassus. The former evolved in lectures and journal entries that span the better part of three decades, the latter in miscellaneous sources that span the better part of Emerson's adult life. On the basis of evidence in manuscript and in print, I believe that even before he received Osgood's request for a narrative, Emerson consciously formulated an important connection between these two long-term projects. The connection was this: the lecture and journal drafts that eventually culminated in "Poetry and Imagination" were expressions of how, theoretically, Emerson conceived of the poet and poetry and of what, at a minimum, he expected from poets of the past and present as well as</page><page sequence="17">Emerson's Parnassus 273 from readers of poetry; poems read after lectures or added to Parnassus lists during drafts of "Poetry and Imagination" illustrated and verified Emerson's theory. To summarize: an appreciation of "Poetry and Imagination" and of the multiple sources from which it was drawn in 1872 is essential to an understanding of Emerson's purpose in Parnassus and its "Preface." Not only is the "Preface" almost wholly derived from the larger essay, but texts in Parnassus are arranged according to a plan for viewing the functions of the ideal poet and ideal poetry finally described by Emerson in "Poetry and Imagination." Before the events of July 1872, it is likely that Emerson intended to use "Poetry and Imagination" not for the essay it became in Letters and Social Aims but for the "connecting narrative" for Parnassus promised to Osgood in September 1871. In offering readings from poets who exemplified certain of his assumptions about poetry when he presented the Mechanics' Hall lectures in 1872, Emerson gave Parnas- sus and its commentary a dry run. Because neither the Journal ST outline nor the manuscripts of the lectures indicate that Emerson intended to do more than read a lecture and follow it with a reading of poems (a pattern he typically followed throughout his career as lecturer, leaving it to the imaginative auditor to make the necessary connection between theory and practice), it is probable that in 1871- 72 he intended to do no more with the final, printed correspondence between theory and practice in Parnassus. Thus, in Parnassus, envisioned with "Poetry and Imagination" as the narrative, Emerson undoubtedly believed the perceptive and imaginative reader would make the necessary connection between theory ex- pressed in the narrative and practice illustrated by Emerson's own careful selection and arrangement of poems in the text. After July 1872, however, Emerson was unable to complete Parnassus as he had come to envision it. Though all materials for Parnassus and its narrative were complete and at his disposal, he was forced by the circumstances reported in section I to delay final preparation of the volume. Because of the terms of Osgood's request and because of the series of correspondences between theory and practice described in section II:iii below, it is likely that Emerson intended to place the narrative in parts at the beginning of section-divisions in Parnassus- though this cannot be proven for certain. When he returned to the project in 1874, he was neither physically nor psychologically prepared to undertake that last stage of work. As we know from his late-November 1874 letter to Edith, he had trouble completing just the brief "Preface" for the volume, despite the fact that Parnassus was contracted to appear within a month. As it now stands, the "Preface" represents little more than a weak extract of "Poetry and Imagination." In the last weeks before publication, then, Emerson was able only to salvage snippets of theory from the essay, so that the "Preface" inadequately expresses his once-intended theoretical context for most poems and section-divisions in Par- nassus.</page><page sequence="18">274 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 Following in the present section are, first, a reading of "Poetry and Imagina- tion"; second, a reading of the "Preface" in light of theory expressed in "Poetry and Imagination"; and, third, a discussion of the correspondence between Emerson's poetic theory and his arrangement of selections and section-divisions in Parnas- sus. sus. After a brief introductory statement, "Poetry and Imagination," as printed in Letters and Social Aims, develops along eight major topical headings: (1) "Po- etry"; (2) "Imagination"; (3) "Veracity"; (4) "Creation"; (5) "Melody, Rhyme, Form"; (6) "Bards and Trouveurs"; (7) "Morals"; and (8) "Transcendency." "Poetry" and "Imagination" are the two most substantial sections of the essay, and in them Emerson establishes both the broad terms of his poetics and the vocabulary through which he would express it. In "Poetry," he defines the relation between "Nature," "particular natures," and the poetic process. His view of these subjects retains much of the idealism he expressed decades before in Nature (1836), "The Poet" (from Essays: Second Series [1844]), and comparable pieces; his language and tone are no less extravagant than in earlier works as here he elaborates his central assumption: "Nature ... is a vast trope, and all particular natures are tropes" (W, 8:15). According to the theory, when an individual scans his world, he, a "fact," discovers various other facts to which he ought to respond and from which he might draw significant impressions. His primary or initial response to these facts is usually "low," taking, for instance, a bird for only a bird, or a beautiful woman for only a beautiful woman, or himself, as observer, for only an observer. He sees nothing beyond "the fact." At quite another level of response, however, the observer recognizes in the fact "a figure or illustration of [his] thought" (W, 8:11). That second level of response, says Emerson, is the beginning of poetry. It is the first stage of that disposition of poets to see particular facts with their particular natures as symbols of an all-enveloping "Nature" in which the observer, as poet, is himself included as symbol. Emerson writes: Seas, forests, metals, diamonds and fossils interest the eye, but 'tis only with some preparatory or predicting charm. Their value to the intellect appears only when I hear their meaning made plain in the spiritual truth they cover. The lover sees reminders of his mistress in every beautiful object; the saint, an argument for devotion in every natural process; and the facility with which Nature lends itself to the thoughts of man, the aptness with which a river, a flower, a bird, fire, day or night, can express his fortunes, is as if the world were only a disguised man, and, with a change of form, rendered to him all his experience. (W, 8:11) The capacity to recognize and, in turn, to express his own experience in Nature's figures and illustrations is the power of the poet. For him, "[all] thinking</page><page sequence="19">Emerson's Parnassus 275 is analogizing, and . . . the use of life [is] to learn metonymy." The poet's imagination is at once in search of and attuned to Nature's panorama of "incessant metamorphos[e]s," noting the "endless passing of one element into new forms" and functioning as "the reader of these forms" (W, 8:15). The poet, who delights in the "shock of agreeable surprise" given by impressions to his imagination, eagerly distinguishes the "ulterior" value of facts in Nature from their primary, purely sensory, meaning. Whether he is "[walking], working, or talking, the [poet's] sole question is how many strokes vibrate on [Nature's] mystic string" (W, 8:16). What of Nature, in other words, beyond mountains, brooks, animals, plants, and the observer himself as facts-in-themselves, is communicated to the observer through imagination? To express what through imagination he reads in Nature's panorama the poet assumes Nature's vocabulary in his art. In Nature "productions and changes ... [are] the nouns of language." Using the vocabulary of Nature representatively, the poet achieves in person and in verse a recognition of "the thoughts of God [as they] pause but for a moment in any form" (W, 8:15). The "thoughts of God" become, as it were, the poet's thoughts. To the extent that he is faithful to the language of Nature as he expresses whatever Nature has imparted to him beyond facts-in- themselves, the poet hearkens genuinely to Nature's "mystic string" and sounds it anew in that "miracle," poetry (W, 8:16). In his poems, as earlier in his imagination, all "words are poems" which illumine "a presence of mind that gives a miraculous command of all means of uttering the thought and feeling of the moment" (W, 8:17). For the poet who "listens to conversation and beholds all objects in Nature," it is not sufficient simply to report or "give [them] back" to Nature, or the landscape, or the reader-or even to himself. The poet must write the lesson he has learned as "a new and transcendent whole"; he must "perpetual[ly] endeavor to express the spirit of the thing, to pass the brute body and state the life and reason which causes it to exist" (W, 8:17). For this purpose he "squanders on the hour an amount of life that would more than furnish the seventy years of the man that stands next to him." But the effort is, of course, worth his investment: in expressing his thought in a poem, the poet approximates Nature, which, having "deep insight will always ... ultimate its thought in a thing" (W, 8:17). Thus, while "[all] thinking is analogizing," Nature in itself is an analogy for the poetic process. In sections 2-8 of "Poetry and Imagination" Emerson elaborates on the principal assumptions and terms introduced in "Poetry." In "Imagination" he reaffirms the centrality of the imagination to the poetic process. The imagination, in effect, enables the poet to move beyond "common sense," which "looks at things ... as real and final facts," to achieve in poetry "a second sight," which looks "through" facts and uses "them as types or words for thoughts which they signify." Imagination at once discovers Nature's symbols and defines anew both the individual's relation to Nature and the universal relations between man and Nature. For the poet, facts, from the commonplace realities of his environment</page><page sequence="20">276 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 to the actions, occupations, and conditions under which men exist, are only "'apparent imitations of unapparent natures"'; through the imagination, the poet transforms facts into symbolic expressions of what and who man is (W, 8:19-20). Imagination defines relations; poetry is, finally, the expression of relations. Emerson explains it thus: Your condition, your exployment, is the fable of you. The world is thoroughly anthropomorphized, as if it had passed through the body and mind of man, and taken his mould and form. . . . [Good] poetry [because of the imagination that dictates it] is always personification, and heightens every species of force in Nature by giving it human volition. We are advertised that there is nothing to which man is not related; that every thing is convertible into every other. (W, 8:19, 23) In "Imagination" Emerson adds an important qualification to his theory which has bearing on his purpose in Parnassus. Without conceding that his theory is idealistic, he nonetheless concedes that the poet who might completely conform to the terms of the theory is an ideal. "[When] we describe man as poet, and credit him with the triumphs of the art," Emerson states, "we speak of the potential or ideal man,-not found now in any one person. You must go through a city or a nation, and find one faculty here, one there, to build the true poet withal" (W, 8:26). Dante, Shakespeare, and William Blake as painter come closest to the ideal, for their art conveys an "insight or second sight [that] has extraordinary reach ... [and] compels ourwonder" (W, 8:27). But in the end, even they are only approximations of the ideal. Thus, in the 1870s, Emerson must admit that, as he said in "The Poet" three decades before, he yet looks "in vain for the poet whom I describe." The poet he wished for in 1844 was one who, like Dante, could "[dare] to write his autobiography in colossal cipher, or into universality" (W, 3:37), one who could see and fully express the world as "thoroughly anthropomorphized" and advertise "that there is nothing to which man is not related." If anything, Emerson's demands on and expectations of the poet in "Poetry and Imagination" are more rigorously ideal than in 1844. Of the ideal poet he writes: He is the healthy, the wise, the fundamental, the manly man, seer of the secret; against all the appearance he sees and reports the truth, namely that the soul generates matter. And [his] poetry is the only verity,-the expression of a sound mind speaking after the ideal, and not after the apparent. As a power [his poetry] is the perception of the symbolic character of things, and the treating them as representative: as a talent it is a magnetic tenaciousness of an image, and by the treatment demonstrating that this pigment of thought is as palpable and objective to the poet as is the ground on which he stands, or the walls of houses about him. (W, 8:26-27) As he continues to elaborate on the initial terms and assumptions of his theory in the remaining sections of"Poetry and Imagination," Emerson identifies those</page><page sequence="21">Emerson's Parnassus 277 poets who, like Dante, Shakespeare, and Blake, present themselves as approxima- tions of the ideal poet. In "Veracity" he states that he does not wish "to find that my poet is not a partaker of the feast he spreads, or that he would kindle or amuse me with that which does not kindle or amuse him." The poet's "feast," that is, the array of relations he defines in his poetry, must be real and verifiable. As Homer, Milton, Herbert, and Wordsworth have, ideal poets must "say how it was with them, and not what might be said"; their poetry must present us with visions in which, we might truly believe, "a secret of God is to be spoken" (W, 8:29-30). In true poetry, Emerson believes, the secrets of God are spoken. To the extent that, as he argued earlier, " {all) thinking is analogizing" and Nature, the creative source of all that is real, is an analogy for the poetic process, the poet becomes a "God," variously creating and speaking the ideas and secrets of man for his fellows. Poetry is science, Emerson says in "Creation," and "the poet a truer logician" than those who "in the courts or in the street think themselves logical." The logic of the latter is whimsy compared to the poet's; whereas they may unravel illusions, the poet discovers and explains mysteries. Like Socrates, the Indian teachers, Hafiz, Ossian, and the Welsh bards, the true poet demonstrates "ideas taking forms of their own," and through imagination he "reads in the word or action of the man its yet untold results." Indeed, it is the poet who completes the creation of the universe: "[his] inspiration is power to carry out and complete the metamorphosis, which, in the imperfect kinds arrested for ages, in the perfecter proceeds rapidly in the same individual" (W, 8:38-39). In sections 5 and 6 of "Poetry and Imagination" Emerson discusses the musical content of poetry-its melody, rhyme, and form-and establishes the ballads, songs, and verse of ancient poets-the bards and trouveurs-as the purest form of musical, poetic expression and the measure against which the ultimate musical, poetic quality of all other verse must be taken. "Music," he argues here, "is the poor man's Parnassus" (W, 8:51). Music is at once a primitive and innocent expression of man's relation to his universe, as discovered in the example of babes who in the nursery are attracted to and learn the first lessons of life through it, and an elevated, truly poetic expression of man's relation to his universe, as discovered in the Welsh and bardic fragments of Taliessin and others who use it to articulate "[the] original force, the direct smell of the earth or the sea" and to speak their "love of the vast and the ideal" (W, 8:45, 57). At the most elemental level, ideal poetry begins in music, for "[outside] of the nursery the beginning of literature is the prayers of a people, and they are always hymns, poetic,-the mind allowing itself range, and therewith is ever a corresponding freedom in the style, which becomes lyrical" (W, 8:53). Beyond the music of the babe in the nursery and the prayers of a people, poetry continues to begin as music, for the imagination insists upon developing thought out of what it already knows. Thus, to express thoughts homely, holy, heroic, political, or patriotic, for instance, the imagination always returns to music. For the poet, the substance of his thought "dictates the rhythm"</page><page sequence="22">278 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 he must employ to convey it. Words alone cannot convey the substance of his thought; musical "mode and form" are needed to make the poet's expression universal and to attract both the mind and the heart of his audience to acknowl- edge, if only through feeling, the relations he thereby defines. For the poet, then, melody, rhyme, and form are the essential features of poetry: they are "the transparent frame that allows almost the pure architecture of thought to become visible to the mental eye" (W, 8:52, 54). "Morals" and "Transcendency," the summary sections of "Poetry and Imagina- tion," contain Emerson's most extravagant, idealistic statements of theory and represent the complete, unqualified optimism with which Emerson views the poet's relation to Nature. "Morals" begins with Emerson's personal chant to the ideal poet and his ideal poetry: Is not poetry the little chamber in the brain where is generated the explosive force which, by gentle shocks, sets in action the intellectual world? Bring us the bards who shall sing all our old ideas out of our heads, and new ones in; men-making poets; poetry which ... is capable of restoring the dead to life;-poetry like that verse of Saadi, which the angels testified 'met the approbation of Allah in Heaven;'-poetry which finds its rhymes and cadences in the rhymes and iterations of Nature, and is the gift to men of new images and symbols, each the ensign and oracle of an age; that shall assimilate men to it, mould itself into religions and mythologies, and impart its quality to centuries;-poetry which tastes the world and reports of it, upbuilding the world again in ... thought. (W, 8:64) To the extent that he "upbuild[s] the world again in ... thought," the poet confirms the analogy made earlier between Nature and the poetic process; to the extent that "Nature is the immense shadow of man" (W, 8:23) and offers the imaginative observer lessons in what he is and what he might or ought to be, the poet is, for Emerson, primarily a teacher, and his poetry is primarily instruction. It is the poet's calling, his moral responsibility, to teach his fellows both the symbols and the relations he has discovered in Nature. Through his imagination he first interprets facts for himself, then shares his interpretations with others; through his intellect he fashions new thoughts out of the raw materials that Nature offers, and these thoughts he shares as well. Poetry for him is the expression of imagination and thought, and as the poet defines the meaning of symbols and relations in his poetry for each new generation, his poetry, "the ensign and oracle of [the] age," expresses an "insight or second sight" (W, 8:27) that ranges beyond the material world into the world of spiritual reality, where the ultimate human condition and the ideal upon which it is based are defined. As the poet knows, Nature figures its own spiritual reality as "exuberant, tranquil, magnificent .. [and] coherent" (W, 8:65). When the figures of his verse impose Nature's spiritual reality on the natural, particularly factual, world of man, the poet introduces</page><page sequence="23">Emerson's Parnassus 279 exuberance, tranquility, magnificence, and coherence to the world of man, where the unreflective eye typically finds things lacklustre, incoherent, disordered--or worse. Alluding to Zoroaster, St. John, Homer, and Dante, Emerson observes in "Morals" that poets carry the extraordinary "moral burden" of being "inspirers and lawgivers to their race" (W, 8:64-65). Poets discharge this burden when, in assimilating and recreating in their art the spiritual reality of Nature, they transform commonplace motions of the intellect into motions of "piety" (and thereby become "inspirers") and elevate commonplace human action to the level of "virtue" (and thereby become "lawgivers"). Poets do not lie, nor do they ignore the apparent reality of their immediate world. But for the poet, Nature offers man a truth higher than, because primary to, the factual truth offered by the petty concerns and actions of men. Thoughts that are no more than common sense reflections; the greed and envy that appear to underlie most human interaction; or the pain and sorrow that would seem to be the inevitable consequence of one's engagement in the affairs of man: these exemplify only the transitory, apparent impressions of the unpoetic, totally material world on the unpoetic mind. Such are not the real, transcendent substance of Nature. As the poet writes, he addresses ultimately the permanent and the ideal; his interest is not in celebrating the common, base, or low. Like Nature, the poet creates in order to effect changes in the thoughts and actions of men whereby human thought and action might more closely approximate the ideal. "The supreme value of poetry," Emerson concludes, "is to educate ... to a height beyond itself... -the subduing [of] mankind to order and virtue" according to the model of Nature (W, 8:65-66). The demands that Emerson places on the poet in "Morals" are shared by the poet's audience. In as much as the poet has looked beyond the commonplace and ordinary, the audience must do so as well. Speaking practically, Emerson comments that both Shakespeare and Burns had the ability to address and express the ideal, and he believes that both have attracted audiences capable of appreci- ating their representation of order in the universe and sensitive to the quality of moral worth against which they typically measure the actions of men. In Shakespeare's case, a "good poem-say ... Macbeth, or Hamlet, or the Tem- pest-goes about the world offering itself to reasonable men, who read it with joy and carry it to their reasonable neighbors." Among Shakespeare's works, these in particular strike Emerson as drawing to themselves "wise and generous souls, confirming their secret thoughts," and attracting their "sympathy." Ultimately, each "affects the characters of its readers by formulating their opinions and feelings, and inevitably prompting their daily action." Of Hamlet's character and fate, for instance, Emerson writes, "We must ... ask whether, if we sit down at home, and do not go to Hamlet, Hamlet will [nevertheless] come to us? whether we shall find our tragedy written in his,-our hopes, wants, pains, disgraces, described to the life,-and the way opened to the paradise which ever in the best</page><page sequence="24">280 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 hour beckons us?" (W, 8:66-69). Much to the same point is the value of Burns, about whom Emerson states, "Do you think Burns has had no influence on the life of men and women in Scotland,--has opened no eyes and ears to the fact of Nature and the dignity of man and the charm of excellence of woman?" (W, 8:67). Of course, the examples of Shakespeare and Burns represent what at a minimum Emerson ideally expects of the poet and of the poet's audience. The audience must be sympathetic to the poet's "marrying of Nature and mind, undoing the old divorce in which poetry had been famished and false [because it was mundane and factual], and Nature had been suspected and pagan" (W, 8:66). And if it happens that an audience is so influenced by a poet's view of the ideal and by his expression of what is finally universal that on its own observation of Nature the audience surpasses the poet's view and expression, then the poet's work has achieved its "supreme value": "The poet should rejoice if he has taught us [how] to despise his song; if he has so moved us as to lift us,-to open the eye of the intellect to see farther and better" than he (W, 8:68). "Poetry and Imagination" lacks a specific conclusion. On the one hand, an essay without a conclusion is not at all inconsistent with Emerson's style. On the other hand, if, as I believe, "Poetry and Imagination" is the unrecognized fullest statement by Emerson of poetic theory, a conclusion would seem to be especially appropriate. It may be, however, that Emerson left the essay or, more properly, the lectures upon which it was based without a conclusion on purpose. What, after all, could he have added to make his idealism more palatable or his confident expectations of a "high poetry which shall thrill and agitate mankind, restore youth and health, dissipate the dreams under which men reel and stagger, and bring in the new thoughts, the sanity and heroic aims of nations" more plausible (W, 8:73)? For palatability, Emerson could only assume or hope for an intellectual and imaginative capacity on the part of his reader equal to the demands he was placing on himself, on the poet, and on any who would be a "seer of Nature." For plausibility, he had supplied throughout the essay poets of worth whose art approximates his ideal of poetry. Thus, in "Transcendency," the final section of the essay, the most Emerson does to bring together the various strains of his poetic theory is to restate the theory through figures already familiar to the reader of "Poetry and Imagination": Every man may be, and at some time a man is, lifted to a platform whence he looks beyond sense to moral and spiritual truth, and in that mood deals sovereignly with matter, and strings worlds like beads upon his thought. The success with which this is done can alone determine how genuine is the inspiration. The poet is rare because he must be exquisitely vital and sympathetic, and, at the same time, immovably centred. In good society, nay, among the angels in heaven, is not everything spoken in fine parable, and not so servilely as it befell to the sense? All is symbolized. Facts are not foreign, as they seem, but related. Wait a little and we see the return of the</page><page sequence="25">Emerson's Parnassus 281 remote hyperbolic curve. The solid men complain that the idealist leaves out the fundamental facts; the poet complains that the solid men leave out the sky. (W, 8:70- 71) 71) During the month before Parnassus was scheduled to appear in print, Emerson, having abandoned by 1874 all thoughts of using "Poetry and Imagina- tion" as the "connecting narrative" for the volume, returned nonetheless to the manuscript to mine it for both expressions and examples of theory which might help the reader place the volume in its theoretic context. Drawing heavily from the "Poetry," "Imagination," "Veracity," "Creation," "Melody, Form," and "Mor- als" sections of the manuscript, he compressed many of the terms, most of the theory, and the controlling assumption of "Poetry and Imagination" into the eight brief pages that would stand as the "Preface." On the surface, the "Preface" to Parnassus might well strike most readers as an extreme, rarefied collection of Emersonesque generalizations; however, against a reading of its source, the "Preface" is better seen as a succinct statement of profound but, because it is so compact, unnecessarily complicated poetic theory. Though unstated, the assumption under which Emerson writes throughout the "Preface" is identical to the stated assumption under which he wrote in "Poetry and Imagination." The assumption is this: Nature is an analogy for the poetic process. In both the "Preface" and "Poetry and Imagination" this assump- tion is central to Emerson's conception of poetry as art, the role of the poet in society, and the ideal effect of poetry on the reader. Although in "Poetry and Imagination" Emerson appears to draw distinctions between each of these areas of interest, distinctions are only an illusion brought about by the apparent breadth he gives to elaborations of theory in the essay's several sections. In "Poetry and Imagination" and in the "Preface" absolute distinctions between Nature, the poet, the reader, and poetry are finally impossible, for given Emerson's controlling assumption in both works, Nature, the poet, and the reader co-exist as one, with poetry the link between both the three as facts-in-themselves and the three in the unified world of thought to which they each aspire. This principle may be stated in several different ways; unfortunately for us, Emerson declined to state it at all in the "Preface." For the sake of arguments that follow, however, some statements or illustrations of the principle are necessary. For instance, to the extent that Nature is analogous to the poetic process, the poet, as he writes, exercises creative power and insight analogous to those of Nature. Further, the reader, ifproperly attentive and imaginative as he confronts each new expression from the poet's hand, is not only an observer of and a sharer in the poetic process but also something of a poet himself. The reader becomes a poet</page><page sequence="26">282 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 in fact when, as he reads, a poem is no longer for him a fact-in-itself but becomes a figure or illustration of his own experience, just as in Nature the poet had found those figures and illustrations of his own experience which he represented in his poem. In their own ways, then, the poet and the reader are one. Initially it is the poet who achieves through imagination and the expression of his art unity with Nature, with the world of thought. Following him, the reader, responding to a poem as an expression greater than mere fact, uses imagination to find in the expressions of the poet's art figures or illustrations of his own experience which may or, just as often, may not be identical to those of the poet. With the poet, but beyond him possibly too, the reader achieves through poetry unity with Nature, with the world of thought. Both, according to Emerson's theory, ideally move beyond "common sense," which "looks at things [including poems] .. . as real and final facts," to achieve through imagination "a second sight," which looks "through" facts and uses "them as types or words for thoughts which they signify" (W, 8:19- 20). With statements of poetic theory such as these suppressed in the "Preface," one might be justifiably bewildered by or resentful of the apparent simplicity of Emerson's lead statement of theory in the "Preface." After quickly reviewing the old habits out of which Parnassus was born, Emerson writes: Poetry teaches the enormous force of a few words, and, in proportion to the inspiration, checks loquacity. It requires that splendor of expression which carries with it the proof of great thoughts. Great thoughts insure musical expressions. Every word should be the right word. The poets are they who see the spiritual is greater than any material force, that thoughts rule the world. The great poets are judged by the frame of mind they induce; and to them, of all men, the severest criticism is due. (P, pp. iii-iv) This paragraph, which sets the tone and range of much of what follows it in the "Preface," is a six-sentence compression of theory from the "Poetry," "Imagina- tion," "Meter, Rhyme, Form," "Morals," and "Transcendency" sections of "Poetry and Imagination." Bearing in mind the content of those sections and bearing in mind too the controlling assumption that Emerson writes out of in both the essay and the "Preface," it should be apparent that what Emerson is really saying here is that poetry is "the expression of a sound mind speaking after the ideal," an ideal which is found and expressed ultimately in "the rhymes and iterations of Nature" (W, 8:27, 64). Because through the figures of his verse the poet imposes Nature's spiritual reality on the natural, particularly factual world of man, the poet knows, and so too later will the reader, that thought and the spiritual are superior to the material, which itself can never be more than or expressed beyond fact. It is in this context that Emerson can say of poets, "they... see the spiritual is greater than any material force, that thoughts," because they are "beyond sense," "moral and</page><page sequence="27">Emerson's Parnassus 283 spiritual truth," "rule the world." And just as the poet "deals sovereignly with matter, and strings worlds like beads upon his thought," so too the reader must deal sovereignly with matter, that is, with the poem before him, judge it severely by "the frame of mind" it induces, judge it and himself further by the quality of the "worlds" it enables him to string "like beads upon his thought" (W, 8:70). Finally, poets should never fear because to them, "of all men, the severest criticism is due." Nor should readers fear to apply their severest critical judgment each time they approach a new poem, for the poem is, beyond a fact, yet another expression of Nature in which the reader, with senses and imagination properly attuned, ought to discover and find verified figures or illustrations of his own experience and thought. If those figures of illustrations are not found, then either the poet has failed, in which event he deserves the reader's severest censure, or the reader has failed to enter fully into the poetic process. The optimum relation between a poet and his reader, with poetry the medium between them, is, as Emerson explained in "Transcendency," for the poet finally to teach "us [how] to despise his song," to move and "lift us,-to open the eye of the intellect to see farther and better" than he (W, 8:68). For the reader, this can be achieved only by applying his severest critical judgment and his imagination to the work of art before him. Developing his position in the "Preface," Emerson ranges between statements of theory which derive from his compact lead paragraph and, as explained above, its unstated relation to "Poetry and Imagination" and illustrations of the theory through reference to individual poets and works. He begins, stating the "Emer- son rule" of poetry: "there is a poetry for bards proper, as well as a poetry for the world of readers" (P, p. vi). This rule is consistent with Emerson's theory and with his stated (and highly personal) purpose for the Parnassus collection. Further, the rule justifies the variety, both in quality and in type, of poems and excerpts included in the volume. For Emerson, as reader, poet, and editor, all poetry begins as "poetry for the world of readers." As with the poet, who first responds to the world around him as a fact, a reader's first experience of a poem is the experience of a fact. What becomes of a poetic piece after it has been responded to as a fact makes the difference between poetry remaining "for the world of readers" or becoming "poetry for bards proper." At issue here is not so much the quality of a given poetic piece, though certainly for attentive readers an appealing combination of lan- guage, style, melody, and structure may do much initially to elevate the piece from the doldrums of poetic fact. At issue rather are the competency of the poet to induce in the reader a "frame of mind" in which figures or illustrations of his own thought and experience are discovered in a poem and the competency of the reader to enter fully with the poet into the poetic process. In the ideal situation (and as a poetic copybook, Parnassus is Emerson's collection of pieces through which the ideal situation has obtained--or has been approximated-for him), the</page><page sequence="28">284 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 reader, becoming a poet or bard, finds in the poem of another his own intellectual and imaginative staples, which may or may not coincide with those intended by the poet. It may be that the reader discovers in the poetic expressions of another delineations of thought and experience which coincide perfectly with his own thought and experience and are expressed in precisely those words, images, and melodies that the reader might himself have chosen had he been of sufficient talent and disposed to write a poem. It may be that the reader "rewrites" one or another feature of the poem, finding in images, for instance, aspects of his own thought and experience which are foreign to those intended by the poet but are not, given the reader's perspective, to his. Or, finally, it may be that the reader literally rewrites the poem, creating a wholly new and different poetic expression out of the raw facts of another's poetry.' Whichever of these three operations takes place, the reader becomes a poet, and when this happens, when the reader of a poem becomes by Emerson's measure himself a poet, then poetry that began as fact "for the world of readers" becomes "poetry for bards proper." Emerson assumed that most poetry remained "poetry for the world of readers," that the ideal situation did not always obtain. (This was likely the fate he anticipated for the poetry collected in Parnassus.) His discussion of individual poets and of poetic form in both "Poetry and Imagination" and the "Preface" suggests that readers, not poets or their poetry, are to blame. Not all readers are equal to the task of becoming poets in their own right. Further, those who are equal to the task may not always be prepared to exercise their imagination and severest critical judgment each time they turn to a poem. In Parnassus Emerson collected those pieces which in light of his own reading were elevated to the rank of high poetic achievement, and the great variety in type and quality of works he chose to include prove he believed that just as great poetry may be lost on the unimaginative reader, poetry that does not completely rise to the ideal may nevertheless be of significant value to the imaginative reader. In the "Preface" Emerson offers Robert Chester's "Love's Martyr" as an example of great poetry that is typically lost on the unimaginative reader. Of Chester's work he states, "[this] poem, if published for the first time, and without a known author's name, would find no general reception. Only the poets would save it" (P, p. vi). He defends "Love's Martyr," which has been kindly described in this century as "a curious melange of stanzaic poems . . . partly Arthurian in subject, partly botanical, partly complimentary to [its author's] patron," as "quaint, and charming in diction, tone, and allusions" and praises it for "its perfect meter and harmony" (P, p. vi).lo Though Emerson's judgment on Chester was not shared by his contemporaries, nor is it by today's readers, the example helped demonstrate how occasionally a "great" work is lost to the world of letters and provided an initial justification for poems and excerpts Emerson chose ultimately to include in Parnassus. (In fact, one may rightly wonder how committed Emerson was to rescuing Chester from obscurity, for he included no portion of</page><page sequence="29">Emerson's Parnassus 285 "Love's Martyr" in Parnassus.) For while dull readers may iniss the merit of Chester's diction, meter, and harmony, imaginative readers like Emerson may often discover in unlikely sources such as "Love's Martyr" specific aspects which because of or despite the talent and reputation of the poet do, on their reading, elevate the work to "poetry for bards proper." As indicated in section I above, Parnassus included unlikely selections such as popular trade verse and pieces by unknown poets; given his defense of Chester, one better understands the rationale behind Emerson's own "curious melange" as he acknowledges in the "Preface" the reasons many works were included in his collection: "Some poems I have inserted for their historical importance; some, for their weight of sense; some, for single couplets or lines, perhaps even for a word; some, for magic of style; and I have admitted verses, which, in their structure, betray a defect of poetic ear, but have a wealth of truth which ought to have created melody" (P, p. iv). Be it, then, for a line, a word, historical importance, or Emerson's own correction of its "defect of poetic ear," each piece included in Parnassus appealed to him first, presumably, as an illustration or verification of his own thought and experience, and second as an expression that had distinguished itself on his reading as "poetry for bards proper." For the imaginative reader lines from the London Punch and works by Julia Caroline Ripley Dorr or Forceythe Willson may have as much claim for attention as the enduring works of Shakespeare, Milton, or Wordsworth. Although quality is not necessarily at issue in defining the "Emerson rule" of poetry, Emerson spends considerable time in the "Preface" making qualitative distinctions between various poets and their work. He argues, for instance, that there are two classes of poets: "the poets by education and practice, these we respect; and poets by nature, these we love" (P, p. iv). Both classes are peopled by men of genius who see "that spiritual is greater than any material force" and that "thoughts rule the world"; both classes produce great and enduring poetry. Though it may appear impossible to distinguish between two classes so subjec- tively defined, Emerson believes that distinctions are possible and suggests how they may be made. Distinctions may be drawn between the classes based on judgments about the relative quality of the technique and style used by individual poets to express their perception of the spiritual (that is, take and assess a measure of both the enormity of the force of their "few words" and the degree of splendor in their expression) and judgments about the relative impact of "the frame of mind they induce" (that is, assess the extent to which proof or conviction of great thoughts is conveyed). Using these criteria for judgment, Emerson finds poetry of the first class of poet compromised variously by loquaciousness, occasional "didactics" (which "kill poetry"), "a defect ofpoetic ear," or "superficial melody" (P, p. iv). In this class belong poets such as Pope, who, despite "all the advantage that taste or wit could give him . . . never rose to grandeur or pathos" in his decorous, educated, and</page><page sequence="30">286 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 practiced verse; Scott, who was "a man of genius, but only an accomplished rhymer, admirable chronicler, and master of the ballad [and never crossed] the threshold of the epic, where Homer, Dante, Shakspeare, and Milton dwell"; and Wordsworth, who though he "has religious value for his thoughts . . . his inspirations are casual and insufficient, and he persists in writing after they are gone" (P, pp. iv, ix). In contrast to Pope, Scott, and Wordsworth, Emerson finds poets of the second class appearing perfectly at ease and natural in their art. Their poetry, he believes, at once speaks of inspiration and inspires. There is nothing schooled or mechanical about their verse, which, like Chaucer's, "will be found musical as well as wise, and fertile in invention." These poets are not obnoxious or persistent in their religious offerings; instead, like Herbert, they present themselves "with the sanctity and the character of the Pentateuch and the prophecy conspicuous in them ... [and with] wit and ... piety [that] are genuine, and sure to make a lifelong friend of a good reader." Like Shakespeare, the poets whom "we love" entertain and instruct through "absolute concealment" of self, so that whether they write confessions, or expressions of defiance, or songs of love, these poets appeal to us "always by thought, and never by [their] buttons or pittifulness" (P, pp. v, vii). In the exhalted company of Chaucer, Herbert, and Shakespeare, Emerson places, among others, Herrick, Burns, Collins, Homer, Dante, and Milton. His selection and his principles for inclusion in the class are quite catholic, for among those who are "poets by nature" there is room even for Ben Jonson, "despite all the pedantic lumber he dragged with him" (P, p. iv). These poets come closest to Emerson's ideal of the poet; their verse exemplifies the highest achievement of which man is capable in the real world of human poetry. It is of them that Emerson thought when he wrote his panegyrics of the ideal poet in "Poetry and Imagination"; it is of them that he again thinks as he writes in the "Preface": The poet demands all gifts, and not one or two only. Like the electric rod, he must reach from a point nearer to the sky than all surrounding objects, down to the earth, and into the wet soil, or neither is of use. The poet must not only converse with pure thought, but he must demonstrate it ... to the senses. His words must be pictures: his verses must be spheres and cubes, to be seen and handled. His fable must be a good story, and its meaning must hold as pure truth. (P, p. viii) iii In addition to both the demonstrable relation between Emerson's compressed poetic theory in the "Preface" and its source in his larger expression of theory in "Poetry and Imagination" and the parallel preparational histories that connect "Poetry and Imagination" and Parnassus, there is a significant feature of the volume which makes the connection between the essay and Emerson's collection of verse absolute and unarguable. The feature, alluded to in the foregoing</page><page sequence="31">Emerson's Parnassus 287 sections, is this: Parnassus is Emerson's unacknowledged conclusion to "Poetry and Imagination," much in the same vein as the poems read after the "Poetry &amp; Imagination" lectures provided conclusions or proofs for theory expressed in the lectures. Had not Parnassus been published, theory argued for in "Poetry and Imagination" would have stood without a fair set of illustrations to support it, but with the volume published, as Emerson himself suggested in his 1871 letter to Edith concerning Osgood's proposal of a "connecting narrative" for Parnassus, the consistency of the critical "pudding" represented in the essay would be enhanced by Emerson's selection and arrangement of poetic "plums" in the Parnassus text. That connection between theory and practice unquestionably struck Emerson as advantageous to Osgood, who, in truth, was probably con- cerned about his copyright, and to himself, not only for the financial incentives offered in Osgood's proposal but also for the sake of bringing to a close his two long-term projects. In Emerson's mind, then, from late 1871 through 1872 "Poetry and Imagina- tion" and Parnassus were inseparable. During that time, as reported in section I, he personally attended to the arrangement of texts selected for the volume, ordering the texts in a sequence that established a correspondence between the theory argued for in the various sections of "Poetry and Imagination" and the topics developed sequentially in the various section-divisions in Parnassus. It is probable that Emerson had nearly completed his work by July 1872, when his house burned, for except for the last two sections of "Poetry and Imagination" and the sixth and final three section-divisions of Parnassus, each new section-division in Parnassus appears arranged as a test and practical illustration of theory progressively argued for in "Poetry and Imagination." As it presently stands, the correspondence between theory in the essay and practice or illustration in Parnassus can be charted according to the following scheme: "Poetry and Imagination" 1. "Poetry" (W, 8:11-19) 2. "Imagination" (W, 8:19-29) 3. "Veracity" (W, 8:29-38) 4. "Creation" (W, 8:38-45) Parnassus 1. "Nature. Land.-Sea.-Sky." 2. "Human Life. Home. Woman. -Love.-Friendship.-Manners. -Holy Days.-Holidays." 3. "Intellectual.-Memory. -Inspiration.-Imagination. -Fancy.-Music.-Art. -Beauty.-Moods." 4. "Contemplative.-Moral. -Religious.-Man.-Virtue. -Honor.-Time.-Fate.-Sleep. -Dreams.-Life.-Death. Immortality.-Hymns and Odes."</page><page sequence="32">288 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 5. "Melody, Rhyme, Form" (W, 8:45-57) 6. "Bards and Trouveurs" (W, 8:57-63) 5. "Heroic. Patriotic. -Historical.-Political." 7. "Narrative Poems and Ballads." and 8. "Songs." and 9. "Dirges and Pathetic Poems." The fact that the last two sections of "Poetry and Imagination" ("Morals" and "Transcendency") do not correspond to the final three section-divisions of Parnassus ("Comic and Humorous," "Poetry of Terror," and "Oracles and Coun- sels") or that the sixth section-division of Parnassus ("Portraits.-Personal.- Pictures") appears to have no relation to theory argued for in the essay should not be taken to undermine my argument. In fact, there are occasional anomalies even in the scheme as presented. For instance, one will likely find overlapping correspondences between theory and poems collected under some groupings, as in the case of "Hymns and Odes," which presents works that may be read in their "Contemplative.-Moral.-Religious" context or as preludes to theory expressed in the "Melody, Rhyme, Form" section of "Poetry and Imagination." Similarly, to the extent Emerson says of melody, rhyme, and form that they are the essential features of poetry, "the transparent frame that allows almost the pure architecture of thought to become visible to the mental eye" (W, 8:52), "Melody, Rhyme, Form" contains a theoretical assumption applicable to the entire Parnassus collection. Despite its shortcomings, this scheme represents an accurate estimate of Emerson's final intentions for Parnassus. Unfortunately, given the severity of his physical and intellectual decline after July 1872, Emerson was never again in a position to complete the correspondence between the essay and his collection of verse. Although Edith knew which poems her father intended to include in the volume (that decision had been made in 1871, when the manuscript was first presented to Osgood, but without a "connecting narrative," and there is no evidence in journals, notebooks, or correspondence that Emerson added any- thing to his lists for Parnassus between 1872 and 1874) and although she may have been aware of his plan to use "Poetry and Imagination" as the "connecting narrative" for the volume, she was not prepared to make the connections that remained to be made between the last sections of the essay and the large body of yet-unarranged poetry, nor was she sufficiently conversant in Emerson's poetic theory to identify appropriate places within already existing section-divisions for material in that same body of poetry. Thus, the scheme above accounts for Parnassus as it was last worked on by Emerson in 1871 or 1872; the additional</page><page sequence="33">Emerson's Parnassus 289 section-divisions and the occasional anomalies in the correspondence between theory and practice reflect the work of Edith and others as they helped Emerson prepare the Parnassus manuscript for publication in 1874. According to Ellen, Emerson took an active interest in the final preparation of the manuscript, but except for reading proofs as they were returned by Osgood and completing the "Preface" in the last weeks of November, he seems to have left the final arrangement and classification of texts and other details not completed in 1872 to the judgment of others. Writing to Lily Ward von Hoffmann on 12 December 1874, Ellen gave this report of the last stages of work on Parnassus: We were all at Naushon for a month this summer and the whole family gave most of their time to it. Indeed every guest this summer has helped in some way, I think. Ida Higginson was there with us, and she took an interest in it most reviving to Edith, who has a real respect for her taste in poetry, indeed so has Father, and Ida made herself especially useful by her classifying skill. She helped decide under which heads the poems should go. ... From that time Edith has consulted her about every detail of getting up the book, and though Edith devises all, Ida's is the casting vote. Their taste in the binding agrees very well. (L-ETE, 2:151) Following is a brief illustration of Emerson's scheme of correspondence developed through the readings of "Poetry" and "Imagination" from "Poetry and Imagination" presented above, placed now in the context of their corresponding section-divisions in Parnassus. Although the following does not account for all the correspondence I believe Emerson intended, it does take into account highly significant sections of the essay and approximately twenty percent of the material collected in Parnassus. (One could easily enlarge the range of reference here by including the section-divisions in Parnassus that correspond to the "Bards and Trouveurs" section of the essay; my reluctance to do so now stems from the fact that such breadth of poetic material really deserves a study of its own.") Because these samplings typify the correspondence that exists between the essay and those section-divisions in Parnassus which came from Emerson's own hand, they can stand as a paradigm for further readings of the correspondence between theory in those "Poetry and Imagination" sections and practice in those Parnassus section-divisions which are included in the scheme above, though not specifically tested here. Under the heading "Nature. Land.-Sea.-Sky." (P, pp. 3-48) Emerson collected whole poems and excerpts by Milton, Thomson, Wordsworth, Bryant, Channing, Very, Longfellow, and others which offer a practical illustration of theory argued for in the "Poetry" section of "Poetry and Imagination." Each piece represents the poet initially caught up in the observation of some commonplace reality of the moment; eventually, through the imagination the poet comes to observe in the commonplace "a figure or illustration of [his] thought," a figure or illustration that in Nature defines anew the human condition. Pieces collected</page><page sequence="34">290 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 here are rich in simile and metaphor. Some as originally written were intended as metaphysical speculations, while others express metaphysical truths for which Emerson purposely excerpted them out of their original context. From bayberry bushes, to grasshoppers, to lakes, to hillside prospects, the poet's imagination ranges through levels of observation, speculation, and thought which always "state {that} the life and reason which causes [the commonplace] to exist" is that it is a symbol. As symbols, commonplaces studied in each of these pieces are elevated by the poet to "a new and transcendent whole." Throughout "Nature. Land.-Sea.-Sky." Emerson's selections exhibit a dominant thematic bias that unifies the section-division: it is with a mix of pain and joy that man confronts and in time understands both his universe and his position in it. Many pieces express those "ultimate," unsettling realities of the human condition which provide subjects for metaphysical and romantic poets alike: mutability, chance, human ignorance-in all, truths that apprise the individual of his inability to achieve immortality in this world. To represent such unsettling realities Emerson chose, for instance, these several lines excerpted from Chaucer's The Hous of Fame (II, 11. 939-56), which under Emerson's title "The Milky Way" offer a lesson in how even gods must suffer failure in a universe governed by chance: "Lo," quoth he, "cast up thine eye, See yonder, lo! the galaxie, The which men clepe the Milky Way, For it is white; and some parfay Callen it Watling streete, That once was brent with the hete, When the Sunne's sonne the rede, That bright Phaeton, would lead Algate his father's cart, and gie. "The cart horses gan well aspie That he could no governaunce, And gan for to leape and praunce, And bear him up, and now down, Till he saw the Scorpioun, Which that in Heaven a signe is yet, And for fere lost his wit Of that, and let the reynes gone Of his horses, and they anone Soone up to mount, and downe descend, Till both air and Earthe brend, Till Jupiter, lo! at the last Him slew, and fro the carte cast.["] (P, p. 45)</page><page sequence="35">Emerson's Parnassus 291 Much to the same purpose Emerson included in full Herrick's "To Daffodils," in which the herald of spring, typically associated with hope and rebirth, becomes in death symbolic of life's essential uncertainty. But perhaps the most dramatic representation of the unsettling realities a poet discovers on his own, finds confirmed by Nature, and is charged by Emerson to recreate for his own edification and that of his audience is this excerpt from Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (IV, 178-179). These lines, which elaborate man's apparently deserved impermanency in the universe, appear in Parnassus under Emerson's title, "Solitude." There is a pleasure in the pathless woods; There is a rapture on the lonely shore; There is society where none intrudes, By the deep sea, and music in its roar: I love not man the less, but nature more, From these our interviews, in which I steal From all I may be, or have been before, To mingle with the Universe, and feel What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal. Roll on, thou deep and dark-blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain: Man marks the earth with ruin: his control Stops with the shore: upon the watery plain The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain A shadow of man's ravage, save his own, When, for a moment, like a drop of rain, He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan, Without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown. (P, pp. 28-29) To balance selections such as these in "Nature. Land.-Sea.-Sky." Emerson included selections that present the poet experiencing, illustrating, and celebrat- ing the joyful, hopeful aspects of life. These offer the reader both hope for his portion in the human condition and intellectual reconciliation to life's occasional, but predictable, pain. Although selections from Emerson's own poetry, perhaps excerpts from "Threnody" and "Give All to Love" or the motto "Compensation," might have been appropriate to include for this purpose, excerpts from works by Shakespeare, James John Garth Wilkinson, Wordsworth, and others appear instead. From Macbeth (I, vi), for instance, Emerson chose lines 1-9 to illustrate such moments of hope as may be had by a poet, who, with his senses open to particulars in the universe of things, finds representations of the ultimate harmony in Nature, which can reconcile man to all occasional adversity:</page><page sequence="36">292 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 Morning. This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses. This guest of summer, The temple-haunting martlet, does approve, By his lov'd mansionry, that the heaven's breath Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze, buttress, Nor coigne of vantage, but this bird hath made His pendent bed, and procreant cradle: Where they Most breed and haunt, I have observ'd the air Is delicate. (P, p. 6). In a comparable vein, lines 1-12 of Wilkinson's "The Diamond" were included as partial compensation for the harsh effect of nature's way. Unlike Herrick's "To Daffodils," in which traditional symbols for hope and rebirth are reversed, Wilkinson's poem as excerpted in Parnassus celebrates the birth of hope out of decay and death. Star of the flowers, and flower of the stars, And earth of the earth, art thou! And darkness hath battles, and light hath wars That pass in thy beautiful brow. The eye of the ground thus was planted by heaven, And the dust was new wed to the sun, And the monarch went forth, and the earth-star was given, That should back to the heaven-star run. So in all things it is: the first origin lives, And loves his life out to his flock; And in dust, and in matter, and nature, he gives The spirit's last spark to the rock. (P, p. 34) Of course, neither of the excerpts above fully accommodates one to the harsh realities of life which all men experience. The preponderance of excerpts and poems in this section of Parnassus which speak to unsettling rather than to comforting realities suggests that Emerson wished to address here facts or reality as most commonly perceived. Full or final accommodation to these facts can only be achieved individually, as Emerson argued in "Poetry" and elsewhere in "Poetry and Imagination." Thus, Shakespeare's conviction that "the air / Is delicate" or Wilkinson's romantic assurance of permanence in a world conditioned by muta- bility is an individual accommodation that some, but only some, may eventually</page><page sequence="37">Emerson's Parnassus 293 share with the poet. Emerson's theory requires that the poet show his audience the way to accommodation; the poet can never, however, take the audience the whole way to accommodation. For this, the reader must assume not only the attitude of the poet who accepts the comfort of Nature's assurances but also the disposition of the poet to test and retest in his own world whether such assurances are actually to be found, and, if so, whether they are valid. For the practical and, in Emerson's case, most personally assuring paradigm of the poet-reader relation and the behavior that he presumes for the reader in this section-division of Parnassus Emerson excerpted lines 88-109 from Wordsworth's "Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey" and printed them as follows under the title "Tintern Abbey." I have learned To look on Nature, not as in the hour Of thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimes The still, sad music of humanity, Nor harsh, nor grating, though of ample power To chasten and subdue. And I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused, Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And the round ocean, and the living air, And the blue sky, and in the mind of man,- A motion and a spirit, that impels All thinking things, all objects of all thought, And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still A lover of the meadows, and the woods And mountains, and of all that we behold From this green earth; of all the mighty world Of eye and ear, both what they half create, And what perceive; well pleased to recognize In Nature and the language of sense The anchor of my purest thoughts. (P, p. 29) In his version of "Tintern Abbey" Emerson presents the case of a poet who admits to a share in the common experience of all, "hearing / oftentimes /The still, sad music of humanity." But, as Emerson himself believed, beyond the "still, sad music," which has the power to chasten joy and subdue hope, there is "A presence that disturbs . . . with / the joy / Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime." That presence," in terms of Emerson's argument in "Poetry," is Nature: "A motion and a spirit, that impels / All thinking things, all objects of all / thought, / And rolls through all things." In Nature, once again, the poet discovers figures and</page><page sequence="38">294 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 illustrations of his thought. So it is to Nature that he and, in time, his reader must turn and return in order to find valid figures and illustrations to substantiate their hope and joy. First the poet, then the reader, must turn to immediate facts, particular natures, to "the round ocean," "the living air," "the blue sky," and "the mind of man." With their senses properly attuned, they will notice therein "incessant metamorphos[e]s," an endless "passing of one element into new forms," and for each in his turn, imagination will be "the reader of these forms" (W, 8:15). It is in this context that the reader, like Shakespeare and Wilkinson before him, may achieve an individual accommodation that makes hope and joy plausible and personally persuasive alternatives to seeing the human condition as the experience of pain, sadness, or sorrow alone. With Wordsworth and with Emerson, the reader who sees with a poet's eye and imagination will be "well pleased to / recognize / In Nature and the language of the / sense / The anchor of [his] purest thoughts," the confirmation of his hope and joy. Although they collectively lack the supplemental thematic unity that links poems in the opening division of Parnassus to poetic theory expressed in the "Poetry" section of"Poetry and Imagination," poems collected under the "Human Life" division illustrate the poet using imagination as the means to define relations, thereby providing the essential correspondence between this division and the "Imagination" section of the essay. Selecting poems and excerpts from Shakespeare, Waller, Spenser, Jonson, Wordsworth, and Whittier, among others, Emerson demonstrates the poet writing in the context of his most common, casual relations (home, love, friendship, manners, and the like) to achieve, finally, the all- important "second sight." It will be recalled that in "Imagination" Emerson conceives of the imagination as enabling the poet to move beyond the common (or "common sense") to achieve in poetry "a second sight," that is, looking "through" facts and using "them as types or words for thoughts which they signify" (W, 8:19). As it discovers Nature's symbols, imagination defines anew both the individual's relation to Nature and his share in the universal relations between man and Nature. Further, imagination redefines the commonplace realities of the individual's environment to include, in poetic expression, a revelation of how "second sight" elevates commonplace realities to a level above bare fact. Perhaps the most telling illustration of Emerson's purpose in establishing correspondence between "Imagination" and poems collected under "Human Life" is his printing of Shakespeare's Sonnet 130. Except for slight alterations in punctuation, Emerson's version of the sonnet is faithful to the original; however, instead of entitling the poem "Sonnet," as he did for other Shakespeare sonnets printed in Parnassus, Emerson entitled the poem "COMMON SENSE. Second Thought." As their title suggests, the familiar lines that follow serve Emerson not as Shakespeare's hymn of praise to his rare love (the traditional reading of the sonnet) but as an illustration of how the poet looks beyond the common and sensatory through imagination to say, in effect, despite the facts, despite "My</page><page sequence="39">Emerson's Parnassus 295 mistress's" dull eyes and lips, "breasts [that] are dun," and breath that "reeks," Nature's symbols invite me to engage in the ideal, finding thus "my love as rare / As any she belie'd with false compare." My mistress's eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips' red; If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damask'd red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks; And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. I love to hear her speak,-yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound; I grant I never saw a goddess go,- My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground; And yet by Heaven, I think my love as rare As any she belie'd with false compare. (P, p. 76) Emerson's emphasis throughout this division in Parnassus is consistent with that highlighted by his handling of Shakespeare's Sonnet 130. He is interested in relations and the imagination's role in defining them anew. Whereas Sonnet 130 portrays the intermediate steps of the process (that is, the poet ranges over multiple levels of fact and comparison before moving through imagination to his perception of the ideal), most other poems and excerpts in the division illustrate the lover's ideal, consuming preoccupation with the beauty or allure and con- stancy of his beloved and represent the ideal or "second sight" of love as already achieved. This is the case with Shakespeare's Sonnet 104 ("To me, fair friend, you never can be old, / For as you were, when first your eye I eyed, / Such seems your beauty still" [P, p. 86]) and Byron's lyrical "She Walks in Beauty" ("And on that cheek, and o'er that brow, / So soft, so calm, yet eloquent, / The smiles that win, the tints that glow, / But tell of days in goodness spent, / A mind at peace with all below, / A heart whose love is innocent" [P, p. 59]). And the extravagant idealism of these two well-known poems Emerson found duplicated in Coventry Patmore's little-known "The Tribute," a poetic celebration of the wonders of womanly beauty and love as represented by nature's obeisance before womanly form: No splendor 'neath the sky's proud dome But serves for her familiar wear; The far-fetch'd diamond finds its home Flashing and smouldering in her hair; For her the seas their pearls reveal; Art and strange lands her pomp supply</page><page sequence="40">296 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 With purple, chrome and cochineal, Ochre, and lapis lazuli; The worm it golden woof presents; Whatever runs, flies, dives, or delves; All doff for her their ornaments, Which suit her better than themselves; And all, by this their power to give Proving her right to take, proclaim Her beauty's clear prerogative To profit so by Eden's blame. (P, p. 66) At least three other relational aspects of life are given fair space in this division of Parnassus: the concepts of selflessness and honor essential to the continuance of the race; the special relation that exists between a mother and a son, which is often enhanced and idealized by the death of the mother; and the desire ofparents to protect and preserve the innocence of their children. All are, of course, commonplace experiences, and as with the poems cited above, poems selected by Emerson to illustrate these experiences usually represent the poet's "second sight" as fully achieved. Thus, to illustrate selflessness and honor Emerson printed, for instance, Lovelace's "To Lucasta, Going to the Wars" for the obvious ideal effect of its concluding lines ("I could not love thee, dear, so much, / Loved I not honor more" [P, p. 63]) and three stanzas from Tennyson's Maud which portray "Maud in the light of her youth and her grace, / Singing of Death, and of Honor that cannot die" (from Maud, V, i-ii; P, p. 72). Poems such as Cowper's "My Mother's Picture" and Nathaniel Parker Willis' "Lines on Leaving Europe" were included to illustrate the second commonplace relation, and in their range of context (Cowper's poem was occasioned by his mother's death, while Willis' was occasioned by the poet's anticipation of a reunion with his mother after his journey to Europe) they fully humanize the dimensions of ideal mother-son relations against the disruptive force of mother-son separation (P, pp. 51-52). Finally, poems such as Willis' "To a Child" and Longfellow's "The Children's Hour" were included to express, with all the romantic enthusiasm these poems and their contexts convey, a parent's desire to hold, in Longfellow's words, "In the Round Tower of my heart," his child's innocence and purity (P, pp. 57-58). III Sections I and II of this essay deal primarily with the history of Parnassus and with Emerson's final view of the volume as an illustration of poetic theory for which he argued in "Poetry and Imagination" and the "Preface." This section, concerned with a significantly different aspect of Emerson's thought and practice,</page><page sequence="41">Emerson s Parnassus 297 has its source in his remarks on the reader in both "Poetry and Imagination" and the "Preface," particularly with respect to his contention that among the highest callings of the poet is that he teach the reader "to despise his song" and move and lift him "to open the eye of the intellect to see farther and better" and, perhaps, differently than he (W, 8:68). Emerson assumed this calling of the poet when in the "Preface" he suggested that it is the poet's responsibility to provide his reader with materials that, on the assumption the reader is equal to the imaginative and intellectual demands of poetry, may enable him to become a poet and, in that context, may elevate poetry initially written for the "world of readers" to "poetry for bards proper." All poetry has the capacity to be elevated to "poetry for bards proper"; however, for Emerson elevation of verse to "poetry for bards proper" is not a function of the poet or the verse itself but of the attitude, talent, and disposition of the reader. This theory has profound and unusual implications for poetry, especially for the poetry of others as Emerson read, excerpted, and in many cases rewrote it for inclusion first in journals and notebooks, then in Parnassus. For lack of a better way to express it, I consider this section a review of Emerson's "theory of textual integrity," despite the fact that I would suggest at the outset that for Emerson a text has no integrity of its own, only an integrity that is read, defined, or imposed on it by the reader. Although the origins of Emerson's theory of textual integrity are not at all clear, his journals and notebooks offer ample evidence of his disposition early on to collect, borrow, or appropriate liberally the prose and the verse texts of others. Journal and notebook entries reveal that sometimes Emerson carefully docu- mented the sources of his appropriated texts, which range from striking phrases and expressions, to an enlightened sentence or two, to whole paragraphs and pages. Just as often, however, he played fast and loose with the texts of others. Sometimes he provided a text's source in journal and notebook entries only by allusion or aside, and then, when he incorporated, or to use his own terms, "assimilated" or "absorbed," the text into a lecture or essay, he neglected to document by allusion or any other means the source of the text, leaving auditors or readers to assume that the text was original with him. Sometimes in journal and notebook entries Emerson evaded the issue of source altogether, leaving it to later editors to track down long-lost sources and to readers of published essays which were drawn from materials in the journals and notebooks to assume, once again, that the text was completely original with him. Nor was his disposition to borrow or appropriate liberally limited to the texts of others. Emerson had no difficulty with and made no apologies for using and reusing materials from, say, his own sermons in his lectures. And as we now know, he routinely incorporated portions of sermons and lectures into essays, mining both to the point that in August 1872, fearful he might soon "roll into the water," he instructed Ellen to burn all his sermon and early lecture manuscripts, "for what was good in them has been</page><page sequence="42">298 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 extracted for the Essays &amp;c" (L-ETE, 1:690-91). As far as Emerson was concerned, all that he ever committed to the pages of journals, notebooks, and other manuscripts, all therein that might be said to have been genuinely original with him or to have been "assimilations" or "absorptions" of the words and ideas of others (a distinction that Emerson would never have conceded as legitimate), became personal depositories of intellectual and imaginative resources, which, regardless of their sources, belonged to him to draw on again and again. Only in the essay "Quotation and Originality" does Emerson come close to a coherent statement of his theory of textual integrity. Published in Letters and Social Aims, the essay reflects his disposition toward his own writing as repre- sented above in his view of journal and notebook collections as personal deposi- tories. In its thesis, "Original power is usually accompanied with assimilating power" (W, 8:190), the essay offers ajustification for Emerson's unusual handling of the texts of others. Though typically read as pertaining to the use of prose, against the background of theory expressed in both "Poetry and Imagination" and the "Preface," against several of the claims Emerson makes about poets in the larger essay, and against the evidence of practice in his citation of the poetry of others in journals, notebooks, and Parnassus, "Quotation and Originality" pres- ents a position on textual integrity which is at least as applicable to the citation of verse as it is to the prose of others, if not more so. Rarely dowe find Emerson going to the extreme of rewriting the prose of those he quotes; he may quote out of context and without documentation or he may "assimilate," neglecting the courtesy of quotation marks, but he usually leaves otherwise unidentified or assimilated material sufficiently intact to allow an artful researcher to identify its source. In the case of poetry, however, we find Emerson reading and transcribing in a radically different way, particularly in those situations in which he assumes the role of the poet and finds in the poetry of another an opportunity to test his own inclination and ability as bard to transform verse once presented to "the world of readers" into "poetry for bards proper." In those instances, Emerson, who could and more often than not did transcribe the poetry of others accurately and who was always sensitive to the claim of a well turned line or expression on his editorial imagination, is nevertheless quite at ease discovering aspects of his own thought and experience which are foreign to those intended by the author and creating through a reordering or rewriting of the raw facts of another's poetry a wholly new and different poetic expression. The application of Emerson's theory in "Quotation and Originality" to his attitude toward the poetic texts of others hinges on a reading of several assertions made in the heart of the essay, assertions that are best represented in Emerson's own words: Original power is usually accompanied with assimilating power.... If an author give us just distinctions, inspiring lessons, or imaginative poetry, it is not so important</page><page sequence="43">Emerson's Parnassus 299 to us whose they are. ... Next to the originator of a good sentence is the first quoter of it.... Genius borrows nobly. (W, 8:190-191) ... [T]ruth is the property of no individual, but is the treasure of all men. And inasmuch as any writer has ascended to a just view of man's condition, he has adopted this tone. In so far as the receiver's aim is on life ... will be his indifference to the source. The nobler the truth or sentiment, the less imports the question of authorship. It never troubles the simple seeker from whom he derived such or such a sentiment. Whoever expresses to us a just thought makes ridiculous the pains of the critic who should tell him where such a word has been said before. (W, 8:192) We are as much informed of a writer's genius by what he selects as by what he originates. We read the quotation with his eyes, and find a new and fervent sense; as a passage from one of the poets, well recited, borrows new interest from the rendering. ... The profit of books is according to the sensibility of the reader. The profoundest thought or passion sleeps as in a mine until an equal mind and heart finds and publishes it. (W, 8:194) "Quotation and Originality" is one of the least speculative essays in Letters and Social Aims. Although Emerson states, "Original power is usually accompanied with assimilative power," the sheer weight of evidence developed to support this thesis suggests that there is a necessary connection between original and assimi- lative power, not a merely usual one. All the prose writers he cites uniformly exhibit a tendency either to anticipate in words, images, or collective expression truths or sentiments later apparent in the writings of others or to acknowledge in words, images, or collective expression their debt to earlier writers. Of Plato, he writes, "you shall find Christian dogmas, and not only so, but stumble on our evangelical phrases." Hegel, he adds, "pre-exists in Proclus, and, long before, in Heraclitus and Parmenides." Swedenborg, Behmen, and Spinoza appear "origi- nal to uninstructed and to thoughtless persons"; however, "their originality [disappears] to such as are either well read or thoughtful[,] for scholars will recognize their dogmas as reappearing in men of similar intellectual elevation throughout history" (W, 8:180-81). Does Plato's anticipation of Christian ideas compromise his intellectual integrity, or does the surfacing of Platonic thought in Christian writers compromise the integrity of their dogma? Do Swedenborg and others lose their claim to originality once readers notice the reappearance of previously developed ideas, perhaps, even, the reappearance of specific language and imagery, in their writings? Absolutely not. In the prose writings of moderns myriad influences are at work. Sometimes writers are conscious of what they have inherited from the past, sometimes they are not. However it goes, Emerson believes it is to the credit of moderns that they have absorbed or assimilated the universal, accumulated wisdom of their predecessors. For the "well read and thoughtful" reader like Emerson, assimilation is not a sign of an author's depend-</page><page sequence="44">300 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 ence; instead, assimilation enhances the justness of an author's "view of man's condition" and underscores the genius of his "original" prounouncements. An individual prose writer's sources are inconsequential, because the ultimate measure of that author's worth is his ability, through imagination, to have awakened for the edification of his fellows some otherwise neglected "profound thought or passion" and to have represented that passion or thought as "the treasure of all men." The assimilative power Emerson praises and believes is a necessary comple- ment to originality in prose writers is identical to the assimilative power of poets. He notes among dated and modern poets much "vamping" about, with later poets always betraying a source or influence inherited from earlier poets. "The fine verse in the old Scotch ballad of The Drowned Lovers," for instance, "is a translation of Martial's epigram on Hero and Leander." Robert Burns and Thomas Moore shared a common source: "Hafiz furnished Burns with the song of John Barleycorn, and furnished Moore with the original of the piece,-'When in death I shall calm recline, / Oh, bear my heart to my mistress dear,' etc" (W, 8:186). But whether the anonymous Scotch balladeer, Burns, or Moore were ever conscious of their debt, and whether their readers recognize it, is finally inconse- quential. Except that a poet or reader's knowledge of sources may strengthen by virtue of precedent the claim of poetry to universality, the "just thought" represented in a poem "makes ridiculous the pains of [those] who should tell ... where [it] has been spoken before." Emerson seems to favor most those poets who knowingly seize upon and acknowledge precedents for their thought and to delight in the discovery of fables such as "The Wandering Jew, The Pied Piper, [and] Jack and his Beanstalk," which, "found in every language," prove how easily "a good story crosses all [intellectual and imaginative] frontiers" (W, 8:186). In their perpetuation of fables as well as in their acknowledgement of and, occasionally, improvement upon their sources, poets, marrying assimilation and originality, engage the noblest instincts of their calling. Repeating Landor's praise of Shakespeare, despite the charges of Shakespeare's detractors who have said he was too indebted to his sources, Emerson states, "Yet he was more original than his originals. He breathed upon dead bodies and brought them into life" (W, 8:191). Much to the same point is his praise of Dante. In the essay "The Poet," Emerson argued that the ultimate praise of the ideal American poet would be that he, like Dante, "dared to write his autobiography in colossal cipher, or into universality" (W, 3:37). In "Quotation and Originality" he makes clear that Dante's "autobiogra- phy" is not an expression of personal fact and his "universality" is not generaliza- tion based on his broad application of personal fact to the human condition. Dante's autobiography and the universality of his message derive, in Emerson's view, from his literary expression of broadly absorbed or assimilated intellectual and imaginative sources, the collective wisdom inherited with and perpetuated</page><page sequence="45">Emerson's Parnassus 301 for his age-and ours. Emerson writes: "Albert, the 'wonderful doctor,' St. Buonaventura, the 'seraphic doctor,' Thomas Aquinas, the 'angelic doctor' of the thirteenth century, whose books made the sufficient culture of these ages, Dante absorbed, and he survives for us" (W, 8:181). The relation between Emerson's view of the need of assimilative power in prose writers and poets who would be original and his view of what is finally assimilative power in ideal readers who would be original in their reading has never been broached before. Yet Emerson left many clues to the relation, and his practice in journals and notebooks and in Parnassus demonstrates that relation at work. Emerson's ideal, original reader is the bard figure developed in the "Preface" to Parnassus for whom the process of reading the work of another is parallel to the process wherein prose writers and poets marry assimilation and originality. For the ideal reader, "truth is the property of no individual, but is the treasure of all men." Without regard to authorship, authorial indebtedness, or authorial intention, that reader is always prepared to approach a prose work or a poem fresh, and on his own reading to give to a line, an expression, or an image a "new and fervent sense" of meaning. Though in Emerson's theory as explained in "Poetry and Imagination" it is the poet (and the point is applicable to prose writers as well) who teaches the reader "to despise his song," in the "Preface" and in "Quotation and Originality" his theory shifts to emphasize the bard or reader, who, in the act of despising the straight facts of the prose or poetic expression before him, creates his own song, gives a prose or poetic piece a "new and fervent" sense of meaning-in all, creates a "new and transcendent whole" for himself. Once Emerson's shift in emphasis is understood, it should be clear that for him the ultimate "profit" and "value" of literature are functions of the assimilative ability of an ideal reader, not necessarily of the writer. "The profit of books is," as he says in "Quotation and Originality," "according to the sensibility of the reader." In Journal NY (1868-70) he develops that principle as a gauge to the right reading of poetry: "There are inner chambers of poetry .. . which only poets enter. Thus ... we might say, Shakspeare's sonnets are readable only by poets, and it is a test of poetic apprehension,--the value which a reader attaches to them" (JMN, 16:117). And with the praise of Shakespeare and otherwriters of prose and poetry who provide books well directed to the sensibility of readers stands a parallel, expressed praise of the ability of readers finally to "despise" the works before them and to create, in the case of poetry, "poetry for bards proper." Emerson succinctly restates the principle in Notebook Books Large (1870-77): "Best value of books, that they suggest more thoughts than they record,-that the reader, once warmed, thinks faster &amp; better than the author" (JMN, 16:336). For Emerson, then, there is a significant relation between the assimilative power of writers and the assimilative power of readers, as both ideal writers and ideal readers aspire to originality in their respective efforts. For readers, all truly original reading is carried out in a process that is identical to that involved in</page><page sequence="46">302 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 original writing. Original reading, like original writing, requires that one assimi- late or absorb the thought, language, and imagery of his sources. The reader may be, of course, selective, taking from the work before him only those thoughts and images that best illustrate and complement his own life and experience. But once assimilated, the thought, language, and imagery of another become the reader's own. Although in "Quotation and Originality" Emerson strongly implies that the processes of original reading and original writing are one and the same and that assimilation is necessary to the originality of both, he nowhere makes the point as forcefully as in the following statement, which was included in the 1859 lecture from which "Quotation and Originality" was drawn but was dropped when the essay was prepared for publication: All reading is a kind of quotation, a resorting to other men's cisterns, and, if we sound to the bottom, we shall find these feeders of the mind to be not only private artificial pipes into every house, and fed by old mains constructed and kept in repair by nations, but these also are patched upon nature, and draw from rivers, and out of the great valleys of the world, which was built for a reservoir and aqueduct. (W, 8:399n) In resorting to and drawing from "other men's cisterns" ideal readers assimilate what the author has assimilated before from the intellectual mains "constructed and kept in repair by nations," and by adding their own thought and experience readers improve upon the imaginative resources that nature had earlier provided for the author. The more noble the thought produced by this process, the less concerned an ideal reader is about his sources. In fact, proportionate to the intellectual elevation he achieves through assimilation are both a reader's free- dom from his sources and his originality. "I expect to find a great man a good reader," Emerson said late in life, claiming that "in proportion to the spontaneous power, should be the assimilating power" (JMN, 16:337). In an aside attributed to the Silesian Karl Ottfried Muller, Emerson discovered a motto that expressed perfectly his conviction of the necessary relation between assimilation and originality in ideal readers of poetry: "'Poesy, drawing within its circle all that is glorious and inspiring, gave itself but little concern as to where its flowers originally grew"' (W, 8:191-92). For Poesy and for Emerson's reader-bard what is ultimately important in the reading of a poem is the reader's own enactment of the poet's earlier "shock of agreeable surprise" given by impressions to his imagination. In "Poetry and Imagination" Emerson described the poet as experiencing this "shock" when, distinguishing the "ulterior" value of facts in nature from their primary, purely sensatory, meaning, he perceives the broad array of thought and possible experience vibrating on Nature's "mystic string" (W, 8:16). The poet's work is designed, of course, to preserve his happy shock for himself and to advertise it for his readers. Readers may or may not finally appreciate what has caused the poet's "agreeable surprise"; nevertheless, as they distinguish the "ulterior" value of the poetic facts before them from the primary</page><page sequence="47">Emerson's Parnassus 303 meaning invested in words and images by the poet, reader-bards will experience their own "shock of agreeable surprise." And for the reader-bard, the source of his "shock of agreeable surprise," once that shock is felt, is no longer the experience out of which the poet wrote; instead, the source becomes fully assimilated into his own field of experience. For example, when Emerson explained in the "Preface" that he had included poems in Parnassus variously for their "historical importance," "their weight of sense," occasional couplets or lines, "perhaps even for a word" (P, p. iv), he referred to qualities originating out of not the poet's experience but his own. According to Emerson's theory, after a reader- bard has read and assimilated a poem, he is the source of its "weight of sense," and he is, as assimilator, the originator of its particularly suggestive lines or words. Thus, quite apart from the experience (and intentions) of the poets whose works he included in Parnassus, Emerson as reader-bard had discovered his own "ulterior" values in the poetic facts he read; to these facts that formerly belonged to another he attached his own "weight of sense," and through them he found delight in what surprised him as an especially apt line or word. Emerson's reader-bard may strike some as an extreme figure, but it is a figure in which Emerson firmly believed. In fact, Emerson is, on his own account, his best model for the figure, and Emerson as reader-bard editing material that is included in Parnassus has profound implications for the integrity of the texts found in the volume. Many years before Parnassus was published he gave a clear hint of the editorial disposition he would exercise there, when in "Nominalist and Realist" he wrote: "What is well done I feel as if I did; what is ill done I reck not of .... I read for the lustres, as if one should use a fine picture in a chromatic experiment, for its rich colors. 'Tis not Proclus, but a piece of nature and fate that I explore" (W, 3:233). In 1868, just as he was preparing in earnest lists of materials to include in Parnassus, Emerson paused in Journal NY to elaborate on his method of reading and, although unintentionally, to justify what in effect had already become his editorial method in Parnassus: [A] poet dazzles us with his lustres, the sparkle of new rhetoric, with his gay vocabulary, shop-new, &amp; it takes some time to see him truly. But I wish to say to him that I like only the important passages. Thus if I read in a newspaper Keat's line, "In the large utterance of the early gods," or Shakspeare's "Make mouths at the invisible event," or Tennyson's "The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls," or Byron's Ocean, "Thou glorious mirror where the almighty's form [/] Glasses itself in tempests-" or Bailey's "And his five fingers made five nights in air." or Wordsworth's "A light that never was on sea or land,"-or Channing's "If my bark sink, 'tis to another sea[,]" I should keep the paper, or transcribe the passage. I require that the poem should impress me so that it must recall me, or that passages should. And inestimable is the Criticism of Memory as a corrective. We are dazzled, I say, by the new words, &amp; brilliancy of color which occupies the fancy, &amp; deceives the judgment. But all this is easily forgotten: later, the thought, the happy image which expressed it, &amp; which</page><page sequence="48">304 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 was a true experience of the poet, recurs to mind, &amp; sends me back in search of the book. The poet should foresee this habit of readers, &amp; omit all but the important passages. (JMN, 16:107-108; cf. "Poetry and Imagination," W, 8:32) Except for assuring himself that his own important experiences are adequately reported and represented in his poem, a poet has no control over what in the end will be the important experiences and corresponding "important passages" for the reader of his poem. Only the reader-bard has final control, as the poem or its separate passages, words, and images become, once again, his own. The lines by Byron, Wordsworth, or Channing cited by Emerson above assume importance not because of the poet's intentions but by virtue of the reader-bard's assimilation of them into his own field of experience. And even his knowledge of the poet's intention is finally of little consequence to the reader-bard. It does not matter if, for instance, he discovers that what has appealed to his taste was, in fact, a source of particular pleasure or a subject of importance to the poet. The reader-bard's only measure of the real importance he has attached to a work in whole or in part is to test his assumptions periodically against the "Criticism of Memory." To put the matter simply: only what is truly important to the reader-bard will be of lasting importance, for reader-bards, not poets, make poetry. Much to his obvious delight, Emerson found that as with the lines cited in Journal NY, poems and excerpts that he selected over the years for Parnassus indeed had lasting importance for him. Writing to Edith on 3 November 1874, Ellen remarked, "Father exclaimed yesterday 'Correcting these proofs is work that pays well. Selections made long ago, and forgotten, keep rising, each as fresh as a star"' (L-ETE, 2:148). In researching Emerson's extensive lists of materials for Parnassus, the editors of volume 16 of JMN discovered that the texts of the majority of poems and excerpts Emerson reminded himself to include in the volume were, on the whole, faithfully rendered in Parnassus according to the authors' own texts. Although Emerson frequently intruded into texts to modernize and regularize spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, for the purposes of this study-and despite the claims of present-day textual editing theory-all such alterations by Emerson can be accepted as his editorial prerogative, particularly in light of his view that Parnassus would have to provide poetry to the taste of the "world of readers." However, his frequent rewriting and reordering of whole texts and citation of material well out of its original context are not so easy to concede as a matter of his editorial prerogative. In fact, in all such instances Emerson is operating under what he considered legitimate liberties conferred by his theory of the reader-bard. In printing material taken out of its context, he reported to the world of readers and to sympathetic fellow reader-bards those passages which, as in Journal NY, he would define as "important": "the lustres," which provided him with a personally felt and satisfying "shock of agreeable surprise." In printing texts that he had himself rewritten or reordered from the originals, he represented the extreme</page><page sequence="49">Emerson's Parnassus 305 posture of the reader-bard, who, on the principle enunciated in "Quotation and Originality" ("[T]ruth is the property of no individual. ... In so far as the receiver's aim is on life ... will be his indifference to the source. The nobler the truth or sentiment, the less imports the question of authorship [and authorial intention or design]"), need make no apology for liberties taken with the texts of others once they have been assimilated, and who, on the principle disclosed in "Nominalist and Realist" ("What is well done I feel as if I did; what is ill done I reck not of'), is at liberty to appropriate as his own the texts of others and to improve upon those texts for his own edification and pleasure. Parnassus (as well as hundreds of poetic excerpts in journals and notebooks) offers ample evidence of the relation between Emerson's practice in reading, remembering, and citing the verse of others and his theory of the reader-bard with its profound implications for textual integrity. While the examples that follow by no means exhaust the many variations Emerson developed in the relation between his theory and practice, they fairly illustrate his most typical habits and editorial procedures. Further, collectively they illustrate the extremity of Emer- son's theory and practice. For instance, though one might for convenience sake use the expression "cited out of context" to indicate, as I have in section II:iii, poetic passages excerpted from larger works, that expression inadequately (and often incorrectly) represents Emerson's position. As the examples show, that expression makes sense only when modified by Emerson's unacknowledged assumption that underlies statements of belief in Journal NY and "Nominalist and Realist," that is, for Emerson, verse was not typically read or remembered in or for context. Instead, reading for "lustres," remembering only the "important passages," and assimilating what was "well done," Emerson in effect created his own poetic expressions out of excerpts that earlier he had found embedded in the larger verse of others. Considering the evidence documented by the editors ofJMN, volume 16, it is probably not an exaggeration to say that more than half of the pieces collected in Pamrnassus have their source in Emerson's practice of creating new poetic expressions by citing verses out of their original context. Yet even with the foregoing discussion of Emerson's theory as justification for his practice, today's reader will likely miss many of Emerson's new creations-just as they were likely missed by readers in 1875. In part, this is owing to the extraordinary range and nature of material collected in the volume. Unless he is well versed in balladry or at least fairly familiar with the several sources from which Emerson drew the nearly two hundred pages worth of ballads and ballad excerpts printed in Parnassus, a reader will be at a loss to distinguish between ballads as they have been inherited through the ages and ballads as they have been recreated and passed on by Emerson. Similarly, unless he is familiar with old Danish lore, or with translations of old Danish lore into German by the brothers Grimm, or with the mass of verse published in nineteenth-century American newspapers and</page><page sequence="50">306 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 periodicals, a reader is not likely to suspect the extent of Emerson's hand in the thirty-two-stanza version of"Svend Vonved" that appears in Parnassus (pp. 328- 30). If, however, his suspicion is aroused and he is visited by a stroke of inordinate luck, the reader may be able to trace Emerson's "Svend Vonved" back to its source: a verse translation (by George Borrow) into English from the old Danish, which, more than twice the length of and achieving more of a balance between action and description than Emerson's version, Emerson found published in the miscellany section of a newspaper, tore out, and after making notations in the margin, folded and stored in his notebook "Parnassus." The situation is only slightly less trying for those who may wonder about the many pieces in Parnassus taken from the works of those lesser poetic lights of the nineteenth and earlier centuries, whose verses, though admired by Emerson, are nearly inaccessible today. Emerson's practice of creating new poetic expressions by citing verses out of their original context is more noticeable, sometimes shockingly so, in his versions of material taken from the works of major authors. In his rendering of them, "important passages" from a play or a poem typically become works in themselves. This practice is fairly illustrated by two excerpts quoted in full in section II: the lines from Macbeth which Emerson entitled "Morning" and Emerson's own twenty-two-line version of "Tintern Abbey." Taken out of their original contexts, the Macbeth excerpt became for Emerson a personal, discrete expression of romantic hope, while the new "Tintern Abbey" became his, not Wordsworth's, way of expressing in verse the conviction that hope and joy transcend all the unsettling realities of this world. The practice can be further illustrated by matching Emerson's notes to himself in journal and notebook lists for Parnassus with corresponding excerpts in the published volume. For instance, in Journal ST he reminded himself, "Be sure to insert the good lines of Keats' Hyperion" (JMN, 16:270); in Parnassus the following "good lines," among others from Keats, appear as discrete poetic expressions, devoid of any relation to their source or original context, each with a title supplied by Emerson. The first selection, which appears in the "Poetry of Terror" division of Parnassus, is from Hyperion, I, 47-51; the second selection, which appears in the "Oracles and Counsels" division, is from Hyperion, II, 105- 109; and the third selection, which appears in the "Intellectual" division, is actually from "The Eve of St. Agnes," III, 19-21, but is mistakingly indexed by Emerson as from Hyperion: THEA Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake In solemn tenor and deep organ tone: Some mourning words, which, in our feeble tongue, Would come in these like accents; O how frail To that large utterance of the early Gods!</page><page sequence="51">Emerson's Parnassus 307 SATURN So Saturn, as he walked into the midst, Felt faint, and would have sunk among the rest, But that he met Enceladus's eye, Whose mightiness, and awe of him, at once Came like an inspiration. MUSIC Northward he turneth through a little door, And scarce three steps, ere Music's golden tongue Flattered to tears this aged man and poor. (P, pp. 509, 518, 128) But perhaps even more telling of Emerson's practice than the correspondence between the journal note on Keats and passages from Keats printed in Parnassus is what is suggested by the correspondence between this short list Emerson jotted down in the opening pages of his pocket diary for 1874 and the excerpts from Chaucer which are alluded to in the list and appear in Parnassus. Inserted in brackets after each item in the list are the item's source in Chaucer and its corresponding piece by title and page(s) in Parnassus: Ariadne [The Legend of Good Women, 11. 2181-2225; "Ariadne," pp. 75-76] Destiny ["The Knightes Tale," 11. 1663-72; "Destiny," pp. 152-53] Duchess Blanche [The Book of the Duchesse, 11. 805-1010 with omissions; "Duchesse Blanche," pp. 60-62] Forecast [The Hous of Fame, I, 43-52; "Forecast," p. 153] Fox &amp; Cock ["The Nonnes Preestes Tale," 11. 554-81; "Fox and Cock," p. 16] Griselda ["The Clerkes Tale," 11. 57-1212; "Griselda. The Clerkes Tale," pp. 385-404] Prayer to Apollo [The Hous of Fame, III, 1091-1109; "Prayer to Apollo," p. 96] Cuckoo &amp; Nightingale ["The Cuckow and The Nightingale," incorrectly attributed to Chaucer in editions of Chaucer's poetry that Emerson owned; "The Cuckow and The Nightingale," pp. 97-98] Milky Way [The Hous of Fame, II, 935-56; "The Milky Way," p. 45] The Poet [The Hous of Fame, II, 643-59; "The Poet," p. 96] (JMN, 16:459-60). Except for the source of Emerson's "Griselda," which is given away by the full Parnassus title, and his "Fox &amp; Cock," which in Parnassus is noted as from "Chaucer: Nuns' Priest's Tale," none of these excerpts, as with the Keats excerpts above, is placed fully back into its original context in Parnassus. Unlike the "good lines" of Keats, however, which when read against the Journal ST entry may seem to have no significance beyond, simply, a collection of"good lines," Chaucer's lines alluded to here already have a life of their own apart from their original context, a life reinforced for Emerson by both the "Criticism of Memory" and the titles he</page><page sequence="52">308 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 has given each excerpt. Each excerpt began for Emerson the reader-bard as a lustrous "important passage," representing, to paraphrase his comment in Journal NY, a "true experience"; each "true experience" belonged originally to the poet, but each, as the pocket diary list indicates, has since been fully assimilated into Emerson's field of experience. Reading, re-reading, and remembering these passages over the years, Emerson transformed each into a discrete entity, divorced, finally, from any context other than the relation established in Emer- son's mind between the title he gave the passage and the thematic or imagistic content of the passage. Thus, except for occasionally referring back to the book in which it was first found, Emerson would never concede that a piece such as his "Destiny" has any significant relation to Chaucer's "Knightes Tale." In Emerson's mind, "Destiny" is his poem, not Chaucer's; in the Parnassus version that follows, "Destiny" obviously stands by itself to express Emerson's view that "All ... is ruled by the sight above." The Destiny, minister General, That executeth in the world o'er all The purveiance that God hath seen beforne; So strong it is, that though the world had sworn The contrary of a thing by Yea or Nay, Yet sometime it shall fallen on a day That falleth not eft in a thousand year. For certainly our appetites here, Be it of war, or peace, or hate, or love,- All this is ruled by the sight above. (P, pp. 152-53) Finally, two of Emerson's most dramatic applications of theory to his reading, remembering, and printing the poems of others-more dramatic than his handling of, say, Chaucer's poems or Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey"-are discov- erable in his source for the poem "Satan" attributed to Crashaw in Parnassus and in his handling of several pieces in Parnassus excerpted and, in one case, reordered from various poems by William Ellery Channing. As printed in Parnassus, the pieces by Crashaw and Channing suggest Emerson's "Criticism of Memory" is more than a "corrective" that enables the reader to recall or recover the "true experience of the poet"; in fact, as these pieces show, Emerson's "Criticism of Memory," particularly in light of his views on the reader-bard, is a license to appropriate and improve upon that "true experience." For instance, his attribution of "Satan" to Crashaw is nothing more than a nice afterthought. The six stanzas under that title do not even have their immediate source in the larger sixty-six-stanza Sospetto d' Herode (1637) from which they were eventually taken. Instead, "Satan," which consists of stanzas 5, 13, and 20-23 of the original, has its source in Emerson's random reading of the 1820 issue of the Retrospective</page><page sequence="53">Emerson's Parnassus 309 Review and Historical and Antiquarian Magazine in which the anonymous author of an essay on Crashaw devoted a few pages to a reading of the Sospetto, citing stanzas 5 and 23 well out of context to demonstrate Milton's indebtedness to the poem as a source of his figure of Satan in Paradise Lost. In JMN lists of material to be included in Parnassus Emerson acknowledged the Retrospective Review's citation of the Sospetto stanzas as his source for "Satan," apparently supplement- ing the two stanzas cited there with others drawn from another printing of the poem to create his final version in Parnassus (see JMN, 16:269; P, p. 179). The case of the eight Channing pieces printed in Parnassus is different and definitely more extreme than that of Crashaw's Sospetto. The difference, of course, is that Channing and Emerson were intellectual and literary intimates, with Channing frequently turning to Emerson for guidance and advice on and even editorial assistance with his poems. Emerson's familiarity with the "true experience" out of which Channing wrote might be expected to have made him more sensitive to preserving that experience in representations of Channing's work in Parnassus; however, it did not. Several pieces are excerpted so far out of context as to escape altogether from Channing's experience into Emerson's own. This is true, for instance, with "Memory," which appears in Parnassus under the same title as Channing's original but, comprised of only stanzas 3-5, 9-10, and 13- 16 of Channing's sixteen-stanza poem, bears little relation to the thematic concerns and larger context of the original, and with "The Earth Spirit," which also appears in Parnassus under Channing's title but, comprised of only the positive descriptions of the poet imaginatively becoming one with the earth spirit and lacking the extended conclusion in which the poet begs for death to come quickly, bears no relation to either the thematic concerns or the context of the original. Even more telling is "The Mountain," a sixty-eight-line poem in Parnassus drawn from a twenty-three-page narrative of the same title published in Channing's The Wanderer A Colloquial Poem. Emerson's "The Mountain" absolutely defies the discovery of any relationship to its original context, theme, or purpose. Here is a poem of Emerson's making, not Channing's, for even the sequence in which the lines used to make up the poem originally appeared is altered to create from Channing's several hundred lines "a new and transcendent whole."12 It is in the example of poems such as Emerson's "The Mountain" as well as Emerson's "Tintern Abbey" or "Destiny" that the radical nature of his application of theory to practice is, finally, most noticeable in Parnassus.

In Memoir, 2:652, Cabot states that Parnassus was begun "as early as 1855," probably dating the volume from the time of Edith's initial association with it. Because of the Journal AZ entry cited here and because of Emerson's late-in-life confession of impatience with the poetical editions of others (see "Preface" to P, p. iii), I place Emerson's intention to prepare his own edition of poetical works in the late 1840s or 1850. 4.

See also pp. 240-47 of this book, where Wagenknecht reprints the "Preface" to Parnassus in its entirety. 7. Evidence that over the years Emerson had been progressively developing a large statement of poetics is mostly drawn from his use of the lectures noted above as sources for "Poetry and</page><page sequence="55">Emerson's Parnassus 311 Imagination" and from his large unpublished Notebook PY (late 1860s-mid 1870s). Among lecture sources for "Poetry and Imagination," the case of Emerson's 1841 lecture "The Poet" seems typical. "The Poet" is not (though one might expect it to be) Emerson's source for the 1844 essay of the same title. Instead, Emerson seems purposely to have held the lecture, which is more theoretical and, in that, more problematical than the essay, in reserve for use in what eventually evolved into the "Poetry &amp; Imagination" lectures and the "Poetry and Imagination" essay. Between 1841 and 1872 he appears otherwise to have used that early lecture only for a portion of his lecture "Eloquence" (1867), which Cabot and Ellen revised in essay form for Letters and Social Aims, and to have borrowed selectively from it in sections of Notebook PY. For Emerson's uses of the lecture "The Poet," see The Early Lectures of Ralph Waldo Emerson, ed. Stephen E. Whicher, Robert E. Spiller, and Wallace E. Williams, 3 vols. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1959-72), 3:347, 356n, 359n, 360n, 363n, 365n, and 513. The unpublished Notebook PY and other unpublished notebooks referred to elsewhere in this essay are currently being researched and edited by Ralph H. Orth (Chief Editor), Susan Sutton Smith, Glen M. Johnson, and the present writer for a three-volume series, The Topical Notebooks of Ralph Waldo Emerson, to be published by the University of Missouri Press. Finally, my view, as will be apparent in what follows, that "Poetry and Imagination" is Emerson's most important, definitive statement of poetic theory has been encouraged by the criticism of two Emerson scholars: Vivian C. Hopkins, in Spires of Form: A Study of Emerson's Aesthetic Theory (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1951), and David Porter, in Emerson and Literary Change (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1978). 8. See note 5 above for location of item 1. In the Houghton Library see bMS Am 1280.212 (7) for item 2; bMS Am 1280.213 (13) for item 3; bMS AM 1280.214 (3-4) for item 4. Another dimension of what is finally the extended history of "Poetry and Imagination" must be acknowledged, for it bears upon the validity of my argument that the essay was ultimately intended by Emerson as the "connecting narrative" for Parnassus. The essay may have yet another source beyond those considered here: an essay originally entitled "Poetry and Criticism," which was written as the lead essay for a volume of essays reluctantly promised by Emerson to the English publisher John Camden Hotten in 1870. That volume, the notorious "Hotten book" in Emerson family annals, was published as Letters and Social Aims, although Emerson had kept to "Poetry and Criticism" as a working title from 1870 to 1875. The volume has a long and complicated history that has been described by Myerson (DB, pp. 331-32, 748-49) and treated at length by Rusk (see L, 6:124ff; Life, pp. 444-45ff); Dennis Welland, "John Camden Hotten and Emerson's Uncollected Essays," Yearbook of English Studies, 6 (1976): 156-75; and, more recently, Simmons ("Arranging the Sibylline Leaves," pp. 341-43ff). The essay "Poetry and Criticism" is said to have been completed in fair form by Emerson by November 1871 and set in proof in 1871-72 by James R. Osgood &amp; Co., which was to have printed the volume in America before Hotten printed it in England. It is impossible to say precisely what the exact sources of "Poetry and Criticism" were, for neither the draft of the essay nor the lecture "Poetry &amp; Criticism" from which it was likely drawn appear to survive, and the essay is not included among the proofs pulled by Osgood which are preserved at the Houghton. There is absolutely no evidence that Emerson engaged in any serious work on the volume after proofs were set until 1875, when he was forced to do so by Hotten's successors, Chatto and Windus, who had threatened suit. It was at that point that Ellen took over preparation of the volume and recruited Cabot as collaborator. Given the extensive documentation of how much Emerson felt coerced into the volume by Hotten and others in 1870, I am of the persuasion that by early 1872 he had decided against ever completing it. Instead, he mined it and its various sources for the Mechanics' Hall lectures, including "Poetry &amp; Imagination," and for "Poetry and Imagination" as the connecting narrative for Parnassus. Though my position on the Hotten book is, admittedly, speculative, I have arrived at it after considering the following: (1) the absence of any significant reference to either the Hotten book or</page><page sequence="56">312 Studies in the American Renaissance 1989 its lead essay in Emerson's correspondence, journals, notebooks, or pocket diaries between 15 November 1871 and 12 May 1875, after Emerson had been threatened by Chatto and Windus (L, 6:185, 274); (2) Emerson's clear conviction between 1872 and 1874-75 that of all outstanding projects yet to be completed Parnassus was foremost (a point tangentially supported by the fact that whereas with Letters and Social Aims he deferred all decisions to the judgment of Cabot and Ellen and declined to participate in the project even by way of making additional lists for the volume, with Parnassus he continued in an active role up to the time of its initial publication and the appearance of its subsequent revised edition); (3) the motivation of a fair, additional profit from Parnassus should the volume be completed according to Osgood's wishes; (4) the striking correspondence between sections of the "Poetry and Imagination" essay and divisions in Parnassus as illustrated in section II:iii below; and (5) the possibility, on the basis of textual as well as external evidence such as Cabot's and Ellen's testimony after Emerson's death about his state of mind during the 1870s, that Emerson may have feared the appearance of a volume like Letters and Social Aims after 1872 as a revelation of his declining powers. 9. This last possibility is precisely what happens in Parnassus, when Emerson reorders and rewrites the works of others; see section III below. 10. A Literary History of England, ed. Albert C. Baugh, et al., 2d ed. (New York: Appleton- Century-Crofts, 1967), p. 386. 11. Although he does not refer specifically to Parnassus or to any details relating Parnassus to "Poetry and Imagination," Hyatt H. Waggoner, in Emerson as Poet (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1974), pp. 67, 82-83ff, provides at least one starting point for an extended study of Emerson's ideas in "Bards and Trouveurs" and his theory concerning the power of bardic verse. Others interested in this subject have been Nelson F. Adkins, "Emerson and the Bardic Tradition," PMLA, 63 (June 1948): 662-77, and Carl F. Strauch, "The Mind's Voice: Emerson's Poetic Styles," Emerson Society Quarterly, no. 60 (Summer 1970): 43-59. Apart from Emerson's opening statement in "Bards and Trouveurs" ("The metallic force of primitive words makes the superiority of the remains of the rude ages. It costs the early bard little talent to chant more impressively than the later, more cultivated poets. His advantage is that his words are things. .. . I find or fancy more true poetry ... [in] bardic fragments . .. than in many volumes of British Classics" [W, 8:58-59]), there is overwhelming evidence of his interest in the bardic tradition as a cornerstone of his poetic theory in essays such as "Art" (W, 7:35-58). The fact that ballads, primitive songs, and the like account for approximately thirty percent of the material collected in Parnassus would seem to suggest an extended study of that material and its connection with Emerson's poetic theory is due. 12.

A Colloquial Poem (Boston: James R. Osgood, 1871), pp. 37-60; for Emerson's versions of these, see P, pp. 92, 27-28, and 6-7, respectively. For his version of "The Mountain," Emerson used lines from Channing's original in this order: lines 1-6 from p. 61 of the original, 8-23 from p. 40, 24-40 from p. 41, and 41-68 from pp. 42-43.</page></plain_text>
