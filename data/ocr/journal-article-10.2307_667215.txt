Applied anthropology has its place, but Western anthropologists need not-as their Soviet and Chinese colleagues have done-"place their techniques and results at the service of the material and social conditions of the peoples whom they study." To fail to prescribe a course of action is not an abdication of responsibility but rather a recognition that "other external non-calculable factors" are likely to make advice useless or worse. "... experience has shown that the techniques of the anthropologist are usually better suited to 'underpinning'-to disentangling a complex set of under- lying factors in a situation-than to solving some immediate practical difficulty." The same general point is transferred to the place of social anthropology in education: "its importance in the long run may well lie in the methods of thinking about social affairs which it suggests, rather than any specific pieces of information which it sup- plies." To me, the most striking thing about this concisely argued and charmingly written essay is the extent to which Raymond Firth has "let himself go." There is, yes, kinship in the piece. And there are economics and witchcraft. But there are also two and a half pages on the culture of Greece from the "proto-anthropology" of the Homeric period on. Laotze and the Slade Professor of Fine Art in the University of Oxford are cited. The arguing of high abstractions violates the intellectual celibacy of most recent British social anthropology (Nadel was Viennese until fully adult). Professor Firth's surrender of his serene and austere chastity is altogether delightful. Some Americans, however, will continue to insist that pure ethnography must go on.

Baltimore: Penguin Books, Inc., 1958. 200 pp. 65 cents. Reviewed by LESLIE A. WHITE, University of Michigan Cultural anthropologists in general have maintained a curious indifference toward one of the most fundamental characteristics of cultural systems; namely, energy. All socio-cultural systems are thermodynamic systems; their primary function is to harness energy and put it to work. Everything that takes place in a socio-cultural system re- quires an expenditure of energy, whether it be building a pyramid, performing a ritual, loathing milk, or casting a vote. Culture has evolved as the amount of energy har- nessed per capita per year has been increased; degree of cultural development is pro- portional to the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year, other factors being constant. The pre-eminence of the United States in world affairs today is due principally to the fact that it produces and consumes about 40 percent of the world's energy from commercial sources (World Energy Supplies, 1951-1954, New York, 1957). The Soviet Union is a greater rival of the United States than Spain (which can hardly be called a democracy either) in large part because Spain's energy production is only about one- seventieth of that of the U.S.A., and because, while energy production in the United States declined about five percent between 1951 and 1954, it increased about 25 percent in the U.S.S.R. (ibid). The energy theory of cultural development was first formulated by physicists and chemists and has been expounded by them for over a century. And, with the exception</page><page sequence="2">514 A merican Anthropologist [61, 1959] of some pseudo-scientific attempts in this direction by Leon Winiarski, T. N. Carver, Simon N. Patten, the Adams brothers, Brooks and Henry, and possibly a few other social scientists, it has been confined almost exclusively to physicists and chemists. (See Leslie A. White, "The Energy Theory of Cultural Development," in Ghurye Felicitation Volume, K. M. Kapadia, ed., Bombay, 1954; "Energy and the Evolution of Culture," in The Science of Culture, 1949; "Energy and Tools," in The Evolution of Culture, 1959.) Since Hiroshima, however, the general public has become increasingly aware of the supreme importance of energy in human affairs. The two books here under review are expressions of the growing interest in energy and appreciation of its signifi- cance. As such they are sequels, in a sense, to such works as Martin Ruhemann, Power (1946); Energy Sources by E. Ayres and C. Scarlott (1952); Palmer Putnam, Energy in the Future (1953); A. R. Ubbelohde, Man and Energy (1955); and W. F. Cottrell, Energy and Society (1955, reviewed in American Anthropologist 58:1141-44, 1956). Only the last named author is a social scientist. In Energy for Man, Hans Thirring, an Austrian physicist, reviews all forms of power production in the history of culture from its beginning in human labor to ther- monuclear reactions of today. He then reviews the sources of energy available to us today and considers sources in the future when reserves of coal, oil, and even fissile materials for atomic energy, will have been depleted or exhausted. In this connection he discusses the interesting experiments with chlorella, single-celled algae, fuels from wood or sugar, solar energy, the tides, the ocean's heat energy, earth heat, the use of heat pumps, and nuclear energy from fission and fusion. Energy for Man is considerably more than a mere survey of power production, how- ever. Many passages, and even chapters, read like excerpts from a textbook on physics or engineering. This means that the book contains more material than most culturolo- gists would need, or even want; and much of it would be too technical for their compre- hension. The nontechnical treatment of power production is, however, effectively and interestingly written. Thirring constantly takes the economics of power production into consideration: such matters as the cost of power from coal, as compared with solar heat, or nuclear reactors. More than a quarter of the book is devoted to energy re- leased by nuclear processes-in which he distinguishes fusion from fission-reserves of fissile materials, the development of nuclear reactors, the problems and hazards of radioactive wastes (households of the future may be equipped with geiger counters as they are with thermometers today), and the problem of harnessing thermonuclear (fusion) reactions for industrial power. We might note that Thirring, like many another physicist, does not think of human socio-cultural systems as being subject to the principles of cause and effect and deter- minism that prevail in the realm of inanimate matter and energy. Instead, they are governed by man's desires, wills, caprices, vices, knowledge, and ignorance. Instances of his anthropomorphism, his resort to exorcism to cope with evils and to exhorta- tion to bring about the good, are sprinkled throughout the book (e.g., pp. 135, 244, 251, 367, 378), but they may easily be excused and ignored. One who has kept abreast of matters pertaining to energy resources and power production will find little that is new to him in Thirring's book. But one and all will find Energy for Man a compact, comprehensive, and lucid account of the history and future prospects of power production. It is liberally illustrated with sketches and dia- grams, has many tables, a good bibliography, an index, and useful appendixes. The Atom and the Energy Revolution is a compact, readable, inexpensive pocket book.</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 515 It requires much less knowledge and understanding of physics and engineering than Energy for Man, and is concerned exclusively with the present and the future. Lansdell surveys the growth of demands for energy in recent times and considers the prospective demands in the future. This is followed by a survey of the sources and means of increased power production, including accounts of the fuel cell, the direct conversion of radiation into electric current, and other techniques and devices. The numerous and great hazards which accompany the production of power by atomic fis- sion come in for considerable discussion. One of the interesting and valuable features of The Atom and the Energy Revolution is a survey of the world, country by country, both with respect to energy needs and resources in general and with regard to atomic energy in particular. The last chapter of The Atom and the Energy Revolution, "The World Impact of Atomic Energy," should be expanded into a full-scale treatise by a modern-minded culturologist, for in it the author has raised a number of important questions for which he has only suggested answers. His discussion of the effect of the use of atomic energy by smaller nations and in poor and unindustrialized regions will probably be familiar to most readers. But he poses a number of other questions which are much more novel, intriguing, and important. He merely suggests the direction that inquiry may take in these matters and the answers that may be reached. At the present time, only a few countries the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly-have the material and technological resources to carry on large-scale programs of research and develop- ment in the field of nuclear energy. How will this affect the relationship of the few great powers to the numerous smaller countries? The growing importance of nuclear energy will, Lansdell plausibly suggests, greatly increase the power of the state, as an instrument of ownership and political control, at the expense of private enterprise. Nuclear energy, in its industrial as well as in its military applications, poses problems that are world-wide in character, and the solutions must therefore be effected upon a world basis. This would require some sort of international organization with effective power to supervise and control. This could be achieved only by a diminution of na- tional sovereignties. Here once again we witness the mighty and inexorable power of technology as a culture builder. As the Agricultural Revolution and the Fuel Revolution transformed socio-cultural systems, so nuclear energy is destined to revolutionize our economic and political systems-if global war with thermonuclear bombs does not destroy civiliza- tion, and possibly the human race, first. We are in a race today between national rivalries, on the one hand, with their precious sovereignties, ideologies, and ideals, which threaten to engulf us all in a desperate orgy of co-annihilation; and, on the other, with a tropismatic groping for an effective and powerful global system with which our present civilization may be preserved and a finer and nobler one built in the future. The way in which modern energies are used will decide the issue. The time of decision is probably not far off. Die Wiener Schule der Vblkerkunde. J. HAEKEL, A. HOHENWART-GERLACHSTEIN, and A. SLAWI1r.
