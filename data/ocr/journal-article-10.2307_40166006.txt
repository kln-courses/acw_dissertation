<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paradiso x: The Dance of the Stars JOHN FRECCERO the fourth canto of the Paradiso, Beatrice enunciates the principle upon which much of the metaphoric structure of the cantica depends. She tells the pilgrim that the display of souls distributed throughout the heavenly spheres is a celestial command performance in his honor, a "condescension" of blessed souls from their eternal home in the Empyrean to the upper reaches of sensible reality in order that he might perceive in spatial terms the spiritual gradations of blessedness: Cosl parlar conviensi al vostro ingegno, perd die solo da sensato apprende ci6 che fa poscia d'intelletto degno. {Par. iv, 40-42) At the same time, it is clear by the inexorable logic of the story (whose principle theme is how the story came to be written) that what applies to the dramatic action applies to the poem itself; that is, heaven's condescen- sion to the pilgrim is matched by the poet's condescension to us. In the poem, the descent of the divine to the human is for the benefit of a pilgrim whose ultimate goal is presumably to transcend the need for any such compromise, except of course (and the whole of the poem is contained in this exception) in order to tell others of his journey. Heaven's metaphor for the state of blessedness is in fact the poet's metaphor for a spiritual experience that transcends the human, an exemplum of what it means to trasumanare: "l'essemplo basti/ a cui esperienza grazia serba" (Par. 1, 70). 85</page><page sequence="2">Dante Studies, lxxxvi, 1968 The extraordinary poetic implication of Beatrice's words is that, unlike any other part of the poem, the Paradiso at this point can claim no more than a purely ad hoc reality. When the pilgrim's ascent to the celestial rose is completed, the blessed return to their seats in the heavenly amphi- theater and the heavenly bodies are left to travel in their respective spheres unaccompanied by the family of the elect - no Farinata strikes an attitude here for all eternity. This amounts to saying that the representa- tion points to no reality, however fictive, beyond itself. The structure of the cantica depends, not upon a principle of mimesis, but rather upon metaphor: the creation of a totally new reality out of elements so disparate as to seem contradictory by any logic other than that of poetry. What is more, some of the elements represent fragments of world systems long since abandoned by Dante's time and fused together only long enough to attempt a rendering in images of what cannot be imagined. The concession of a command performance to the pilgrim within the fiction of the story stands for a poetic tour deforce whereby Dante reconciles Christian images of heaven with a neoplatonic cosmic vision in a synthesis which, for all of its reputedly "medieval" flavor, seems almost baroque in its daring and fragility. It is the poignancy of the Paradiso y as it is of baroque poetry, that the synthesis is dissipated by the poem's ending: Cosl la neve al sol si disigilla, cosl al vento ne le foglie levi si perdea la sentenza di Sibilla. {Par. xxxm, 64-66) Whether the reader is left, like Dante, with an ineffable sweetness in his heart, or with what a baroque theorist called "the taste of ashes"1 is a question that transcends the limits of poetry. We can, however, set out to identify the various elements that go to make up the kaleidoscopic structure of the Paradiso with a view to understanding not only how they fit together, but also their metaphoric relationship to the spiritual reality they were chosen to represent. It is my intention in this paper to examine a very small portion of the Paradiso with these ends in view. Specifically, I should like to identify some of the elements of symbolic cosmology contained in Dante's description of the Heaven of the Sun and to discuss some of the themes that make possible in these cantos the translation of beatitude into astronomical terms. 86</page><page sequence="3">Paradiso X; The Dance of the Stars, john freccero Before proceeding, however, it would be well to identify, in Dante's terms, the process whereby he pieces together his spatial metaphor for beatitude. It is characteristic of the poet that at the moment of his striking tour deforce he should invoke the authority of the Bible for his accommodation of spiritual reality to human faculties. Immediately after telling Dante about the descent of the blessed to the planetary spheres, Beatrice says: Per questo la Scrittura condescende a vostra facilitate, e piedi e mano attribuisce a Dio, ed altro intende . . . (Par. iv, 43-45) We have already noted that the accommodation of heaven to the senses of the pilgrim stands for the accommodation of the poet's experience per verba to us, but the pattern for all such accommodation was established by the Bible, the eternal witness of God's accommodation - his Word - to man. Thus, at precisely the point in the Paradiso where Dante seems to depart most radically from the Christian tradition, he implies that his accomplishment is essentially an imitation of the Bible. This passage might well serve as confirmation (if confirmation were still required) of Charles Singleton's thesis2 that Dante consciously chose to write an allegory which he took to be Biblical even in those passages where we are inclined to see more of Plato, Servius and Macrobius than of the Holy Spirit. Nevertheless, the Christian mystery underlying Dante's representation seems to be clothed in Platonic myth. Beatrice's words in the fourth canto are occasioned by what the pilgrim assumes to be a resemblance of the Paradiso to Plato's Timaeus, inasmuch as the blessed souls seem to dwell eternally in the stars, "secondo la sentenza di Platone" (v. 24). If Plato's text means what it says, Beatrice denies that the resemblance can be real. If, on the other hand, . . . sua sentenza e d'altra guisa che la voce non suona, . . . esser puote con intenzion da non esser derisa. (Par. iv, 55-57) The implication is that if Plato intends his account to be read as myth, then it may be taken to bear a resemblance to the representation of the Paradiso. Whatever this implied resemblance suggests for the interpreta- 87</page><page sequence="4">Dante Studies, lxxxvi, 1968 tion of Plato, it certainly seems to reinforce the suggestion that the descent of the blessed to the heavenly spheres is in fact a dramatization of the process of myth-making and, as such, is an extended figure for what the poet is himself doing as he writes his poem. The relationship of the true home of the blessed in the Empyrean to the temporary positions they occupy in the celestial spheres is exactly the relationship between Plato's presumed meaning and his mythical account of it in the Timaeus. Paradoxically then, in this most theological of cantiche, Dante seems to fashion his representation according to what might be called the allegory of poets (for Plato is surely a poet in this respect) ; yet the paradox is compounded and thus, perhaps, resolved by the suggestion that, while the technique and the terms of the figure may be Platonic, the inspiration is essentially Biblical. The Biblical representation of Divine Reality in anthropomorphic terms would seem to be the exemplar of all such verbal accommodations, in which the letter says one thing "ed altro intende." It should be noted in passing that Beatrice's theory about the possible meaning of the Platonic myth concerning the stellar origin and the stellar destiny of the human soul may indirectly shed some light on the question of how extensive was Dante's knowledge of the Timaeus tradition.3 She suggests that the myth really refers to the doctrine of stellar influences: S'elli intende tornare a queste rote Tonor de la influenza e '1 biasmo, forse in alcun vero suo arco percuote. Questo principio, male inteso, torse gia tutto il mondo quasi, si che Giove, Mercurio e Marte a nominar trascorse. (Par. iv, 58-63) It happens that this explanation of the myth as an "integumentum"4 for describing stellar influence occurs in twelfth-century apologetics for Plato associated with the School of Chartres.5 In particular, Guillaume de Conches, in his glosses on the Timaeus, not only ascribes this kind of meaning to Plato, but immediately follows his interpretation with a qualification, lest he be accused of an heretical astrological determinism.6 Similarly, in his glosses on the meter of Boethius which alludes to the Platonic myth, he puts forward the same interpretation and a similar qualification: Deus disposuit animas super Stellas, idest ejus nature fecit animas, quod effectu stellarum, 88</page><page sequence="5">Paradiso X: The Dance of the Stars, john freccero habent suum esse in corporibus. Ex stellis enim est calor, sine quo est nulla vita, nee anima esse potest; non quod dicunt omnia que contingunt, ex stellis venire homini, sed quedam, ut calores et frigora, quedam infirmitates et similia. Si vero aliquis dicat: Nonne ista a Deo fuerunt? Responsio: Fiunt, sed per effectum stellarum.7 It would seem, then, that Beatrice's similar interpretation of the passage from the Timaeus, with its corresponding qualification about the limits of astrological influence, reflects a knowledge on the part of the poet that is more than casual of both the text and the interpretation which made the theme acceptable to Christian philosophers. It is quite clear that Beatrice's suggested philosophical interpretation of the Platonic myth cannot provide us with a literary explanation of why Dante chose to structure his ad hoc poetical representation so as to resemble it. We have seen that the extended metaphor of the Paradiso, established by the command performance of the elect for the benefit of the pilgrim, is in fact a poetic reconciliation of the Platonic myth of the stellar souls with the Christian conception of Heaven.8 We have also observed that in constructing his representation, Dante seemed to be imitating the technique of both Plato and the Bible. I should now like to discuss other facets of the significance attributed to the Platonic myth in the Middle Ages, not mentioned by Beatrice, but nonetheless crucial for under- standing how this theme from the Timaeus functions within the extended metaphor of the paradisiac representation. This will lead us directly into an examination of the Heaven of the Sun, our example of metaphoric structure in the Paradiso. In a series of previous studies I have tried to show that the tradition established by the Timaeus according to which the spiritual development of the soul was represented by corporeal movement is the ultimate (although not necessarily proximate) source of Dante's own allegorical journey in the poem.9 For Plato, the most perfect of all corporeal motion was that exemplified by the regular, diurnal circulation of the stars. It follows, at least according to the logic of myth, that the most perfect movement of the mind, the microcosmic equivalent of the universe, could best be represented by the movement of the stars.10 The stars, that is, perfect rationality, represent at once the soul's birthright and its destiny ; education is the process whereby the star-soul, fallen to earth, struggles to regain its celestial home. So in Dante's poem, the stars represent the goal of the itinerary of the mind: a goal barely glimpsed at 89</page><page sequence="6">Dante Studies, lxxxvi, ig68 the end of the Inferno, within reach by the end of the Purgatorio and achieved at journey's end.11 This allegorical significance of stellar movement is probably implicit in the somewhat obscure etymology of the latin word consider atio (cum+ sxier are, to move with the stars?) which was given technical force in the mystical theology of St. Bernard. Such a resonance seems to come very close to the surface in the verse that Dante uses to describe the soul of Richard of St. Victor, "che a considerar fu piu che viro" (Par. x, 132). Given the profusion of comparisons of the "spiriti sapienti" to the stars and the fact these blessed souls represent most particularly the intellectual perfection for which the pilgrim strives, it does not seem too much to suppose that Dante intended to give the word a Platonic force whether or not that force is demonstrably part of the semantic tradition.12 At any rate, it is clear to the most casual reader of the Paradiso that the souls of the Heaven of the Sun, as well as those of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are repeatedly compared to the fixed stars. On the face of it, this comparison of the souls to stars would seem to create a poetic difficulty somewhat analogous to the difficulty of recon- ciling the immaterial Christian Paradise with the Platonic heavenly spheres, at least as far as the representation of the Heaven of the Sun is concerned. Put most simply, that representation raises the question of what stars are doing in the sphere of the Sun. The blessed souls have achieved the spiritual perfection toward which the pilgrim strives by degrees; the fiction of their temporary descent to the heavenly spheres makes it possible for the pilgrim to see and talk with them while he is still short of his goal. In imagistic terms, the perfection toward which he strives and which they have achieved is expressed in terms of the fixed stars. Under what circumstances can stars be said to "descend" to the Sun? The rules of physics or of logic admittedly do not apply to poetic representations; once having accepted the fact that Dante's representation is not meant to represent any recognizable material reality, we are inclined to accept without question a stellar display, the souls of the "spiriti sapienti," in the sphere of the Sun, especially since we do not believe in a sphere of the Sun and are inclined to take a post-Galilean view of astrono- mical imagery anyway. However, a contemporary of the poet with an equal amount of astronomical learning would not have failed to see that there is in the Heaven of the Sun an image mediating between the solar 90</page><page sequence="7">Paradiso x; The Dance of the Stars, john freccero and stellar elements of the poet's metaphor and therefore binding them together into the kind of coherence that one would expect of a metaphor that seeks to establish a new reality. The poet sets forth the controlling image of his representation by beginning the canto with one of his most imperious and most famous addresses to the reader, inviting him to look up, neither to the stars nor to the sun, but to a point on the Zodiac, the Sun's apparent path through the stars: Leva dunque, lettor, a Take ruote meco la vista dritto a quella parte dove Tun moto e l'altro si percuote; e 11 comincia a vagheggiar ne l'arte di quel maestro che dentro a se l'ama tanto che mai da lei Tocchio non parte. (Par, x, 7-12) We shall have occasion to discuss the significance of these verses later in this paper. For the moment, however, I should like to show that this mention of the Zodiac, which may at first seem somewhat irrelevant, in fact invites the reader to consider that part of the heavens which, because of traditional associations, probably suggested to the poet the scene that he describes in the rest of the canto. Were it any other poet, a similar scene might strike us as bizarre or at least as undignified. The twelve spirits form a circle around the poet and his guide and begin their dance: Poi si cantando quelli ardenti soli si fuor girati intorno a noi tre volte, come stelle vicine a' fermi poli, donne mi parveF - non da ballo sciolte, ma che s'arrestin tacite, ascoltando fin che le nove note hanno ricolte. (Par. x, 76-81) The consummate artistry of these lines temporarily suppresses the astonishment that one experiences in retrospect when one realizes that these twelve stars are among the greatest heroes of Christian philosophy and theology. The masterstroke of the second terzina, the pause before the continuation of the dance, both sets the scene dramatically for the speech that is to follow and allows the reader the time to contemplate the tour de force; it is in fact a subtle underscoring of what I have been 91</page><page sequence="8">Dante Studies, lxxxvi, ig68 referring to as the "command performance" quality of the cantica - in the normal course of things, the circumpolar dance of the stars awaits no man.13 In spite of the reader's sense of novelty in reading these lines, however, it happens that they depend in part upon a very precise tradition, an examination of which may help us to see that the dance is in fact zodiacal. The origins of the theme of what I shall call the "zodiacal dance" of wisemen are doubtless lost in antiquity and are at any rate not immediate- ly relevant. For our purposes, the earliest and best text I am able to offer is Gnostic in origin, was known to St. Augustine14 and was transmitted in apocryphal Acts of John. On close inspection, it seems to reveal many of the elements present in the Dantesque scene. After recounting several incidents of his discipleship, the pseudo-John tells us that the Saviour one day called the apostles together and commanded them to form a ring around him and to sing and dance: So He commanded us to make as it were a ring, holding one another's hands and Himself standing in the middle. He said, "Respond 'Amen* to me." He began, then, to sing a hymn and to say: "Glory to Thee, Father!" And we, going about in a ring, said: "Amen" Glory to Thee, Word! Glory to Thee, Grace! Amen . . . I would wash myself and I would wash. Amen. Grace is dancing. I would pipe, dance all of you! Amen. I would mourn, lament all of you! Amen. An Ogdoad is singing with us! Amen. The Twelfth number is dancing above. Amen. And the Whole that can dance. Amen . . .I5 Nowhere is the astronomical imagery explicit in this hymn, but without it, the last three lines are incomprehensible. The "Ogdoad" is the number eight, the favorite of the Gnostics, standing for, among other things, the eight celestial spheres.16 "The Whole" that can dance seems in fact to be a reference to the cosmos, whose rotation is the eternal dance to the "harmony of the spheres." Finally, the "twelfth number" that dances above, the emblem of these twelve disciples who dance below (and the ancestor of the twelve spirits who dance in the Heaven of the Sun), is the Zodiac, whose twelve constellations were represented, in a tradition that goes as far back as the Chaldeans,17 surrounding the most important of all heavenly bodies (see illustration).18 In short, the hymn depends upon one 92</page><page sequence="9">Sketch of part of the pavement of the Baptistery of Florence (See footnote 18). 93</page><page sequence="10">Dante Studies, lxxxvi, 1968 of the most ancient of Christian mysteries: Christ is the Sun.19 As the twelve constellations surround what Dante calls the "sole sensibile," so the twelve disciples turn about Christ, Whom Dante calls the "Sole de li Angeli" (Par. x, 53). It is one of the ironies of intellectual history that the cult of the Sun, adapted eventually to the exigencies of Christian symbolism, should have reached its highest point within a Ptolomeic world-view, when its centrality was regarded as purely symbolic.20 The comparison of the twelve disciples to the twelve signs of the Zodiac is not simply an inference from an isolated text. The theme has been carefully documented by Jean Danielou,21 who has traced it from Judaeo-Hellenic antiquity (the comparison of the twelve tribes to the Zodiac) to fourth-century Christianity, although he does not mention the hymn quoted above. The persistence of the theme throughout the Middle Ages had been previously traced by F. Piper in the nineteenth century.22 To sum up their findings, we may say that the association arose because of the importance of the number twelve in both the astronomical (twelve hours in the day, twelve months in the year, twelve signs of the Zodiac) and the Biblical (twelve tribes of Israel, twelve gates of the temple, twelve apostles, etc.) traditions. Indeed, some historians of comparative religion trace the rise of the latter to the former.23 The exegetical tradition centered the association on those Biblical passages which seemed to identify Christ as the "Day of the Lord" (Ps. 117, 24) and as the "Year of the Lord" (Is. 61, 2). It may seem like forcing the text to invoke this tradition for an explanation of the scene in the Paradiso. If twelve theologians and philosophers are easily assimilable to twelve Apostles, can the same be said for the signifiers of the respective comparisons? That is, could Dante have assimilated a whole Zodiacal sign or a whole constellation with a single star? A Biblical passage which has little relevance for Danielou's exposition but which is central to ours enables us to answer in the affirmative. In a passage from the Apocalypse which is probably of some importance for understanding the imagery of Paradiso xxra (and such an understanding does seem to be required for all but the Crocean reading of the poem), there appear to be twelve stars which the exegetical tradi- tion assimilated to the theme under discussion: "And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars" (Apoc. 12, 1). The 94</page><page sequence="11">Paradiso x: The Dance of the Stars, john freccero Sun in this portrait was invariably glossed as a reference to Christ and the twelve stars as his disciples.24 The motif of the crown of stars is explicitly recalled in the tradition studied by Danielou (Ps. 64, 12: "Benedices coronae anni benignitatis tuae") as it is by Dante (Par. x, 65 ; Par. x, 92; Par. xra, 13-15). The passage from the Apocalypse seems to supply the complement to the Zodiacal theme required for an account of Dante's representation. There is another passage in Paradiso x which, when interpreted in the light of this central theme, gains considerably in coherence. It is not in itself obscure, yet it seems difficult to understand its presence in the poem until we consider the central astronomical figure which binds it to the rest of the canto - an organizing principle, as it were, at the imagistic level. I refer to the exquisite image of the mechanical clock at the end of the canto. For all of its familiarity to us, it must have startled contem- poraries, most of whom had undoubtedly never seen any such device.25 It serves as an example of how radically juxtaposed elements, in this case the most ancient ideas of astronomic speculation and the most modern of mechanical inventions, are fused together in Dante's synthesis, much as Solomon and Siger of Brabant26 both find a place in his cast of characters: Indi come orologio die ne chiami ne Fora che la sposa di Dio surge a mattinar lo sposo perche Tami che Tuna parte l'altra tira e urge, "tin tin" sonando . . . (Par. x, 139 £) Of the many themes alluded to in this dense and beautiful passage- the sun and the liturgy,27 the Church and Christ as Bride and Bridegroom, the dawn song of lovers28 - I should like to single out just one: the aptness of comparing the "spiriti sapienti" to an instrument for measuring the diurnal course of the Sun. We have seen from the discussion of Dani6lou's work that solar imagery applied to Christ in both of his symbolic roles, as both the Day and the Year of the Lord. Because the Sun measures both the day and the year (it is for this reason "lo ministro maggior de la natura" - Par. x, 28), its path, the Zodiac, may be said to mark both the hours and the months. The manifestation of the number twelve would seem to serve to compress universal history - the span of history repre- sented by the "spiriti sapienti," the hours and the years - into the eternal 95</page><page sequence="12">Dante Studies, lxxxvi, ig68 now of the "dance" in the Empyrean of which this is a foreshadowing. A text from St. Ambrose will serve as an example of the tradition: If the whole duration of the world is like a single day, its hours mark off centuries: in other words, the centuries are its hours. Now there are twelve hours in the day. There- fore, in the mystic sense, the Day is indeed Christ. He has his twelve Apostles, who shone with the light of heaven, in which Grace has its distinct phases.29 So in Dante's Paradiso, the souls of the blessed take in all of history by gazing into history's center: ". . . mirando il Punto/ a cui tutti li tempi son presenti" (Par. xvn, 17-18).30 The fact that this is a foreshadowing of the movement of the blessed souls in the Empyrean may serve to explain why the center of this circular dance is not occupied by the Sol salutis,31 but simply by the pilgrim and his guide. Beatrice clearly contrasts this representation with the paradisiac original when she contrasts this material sun with the "Sole de li Angeli." There is, however, one comparison that suggests Beatrice's role in the representation, her position in the center of the circular dance, is very much like that of a heavenly body - not the Sun, but the Moon: Io vidi piu fulgor vivi e vincenti far di noi centro e di se far corona, piu dolci in voce che in vista lucenti. Cosl cinger la figlia di Latona vedem talvolta, quando l'aere e pregno si che ritenga il fil che fa la zona. (Par. x, 64-69) This passage cannot be dismissed as merely decorative or merely metaphoric, for the comparison it suggests between Beatrice and the pilgrim on one hand and the Moon on the other has been rigorously prepared by the verses which immediately precede it. Beatrice tells the pilgrim to thank God, Whom she refers to as the Sun, for having given him the grace to ascend to the sphere of the material Sun. He does so with such concentration that he forgets Beatrice for the moment: "E si tutto il mio amore in lui si mise/ che Beatrice eclisso ne l'oblio" (Par. x, 59-60). The word "eclipse" here refers, not to a darkening, but rather to a blotting out by a greater light, as Benvenuto da Imola observed: " [Beatrix] eclipsata est, idest, nubilata in luce."32 It is a commonplace of symbolic astronomy that the Moon regularly endures such an "eclipse" 96</page><page sequence="13">Paradiso X: The Dance of the Stars, john freccero as it approaches the light of the Sun, which for this reason is thought of as a lover embracing his beloved.33 This submerged significance of Beatrice's "eclipse" by God comes to the surface in the lines immediately following, when she is indirectly compared to the Moon. The phenomenon of the halo around the moon (sometimes referred to in the Middle Ages as Iris, like the rainbow to which Dante later com- pares the spirits [Par. xn, 10 ff.])34 is a substitute for an astronomical spectacle, the Sun surrounded by the stars, which no mortal eye can ever see. We may presume, then, that it stands to the Sun as the human to the divine or, to use Dante's own language, as the "essemplo" to the "essemplare" (Par. xxvm, 55-56). It is abundantly clear that the Sun is here a symbol for divinity and that Beatrice is associated with the moon; it remains for us to establish the sense in which she may be said to substitute for the referent of the solar image whose history we have discussed. It will come as no surprise, given what we know of what Hugo Rahner35 has called the "Christian Mystery" of the Sun and Moon, if we suggest that Beatrice's role here is meant to be emblematic of the Church guiding the faithful. Put most simply, we may say that if the twelve Apostles are the Zodiac of Sol Christi, then the twelve philosophers and theologians are the "corona" of Luna Ecclesiae. From the earliest days of Christianity, as Rahner has shown, "it is as though Helios and Selene were only created in order - to quote Origen - 'to carry out their stately dance for the salvation of the world.'"36 The ancient world had already established the relationship between Sun and Moon as that of lovers; it remained only to apply the teaching of Paul about the Heavenly Bridegroom and His Bride to that ancient image- complex in order to see in the mysterium Lunae the whole drama of the Church. The waxing and waning of the Moon, the derivation of its light from the Sun, its illumination in darkness and its fading in the light of day all seemed perfect allegories of the relationship of Christ to the Church. The woman "clothed with the Sun" of Apoc. 12 (quoted above) became the locus classicus for discussions of this kind which, according to Rahner, were perfected in the writings of Augustine. Rahner ends his discussion by citing Paradiso xxm, Dante's direct treatment of the theme: Quale nei plenilunii sereni Trivia ride tra le ninfe etterne die dipingon lo ciel per tutti i seni, 97</page><page sequence="14">Dante Studies, lxxxvi, 1968 vidi, sopra migliaia di lucerne, un Sol che tutte quante l'accendea, come fa il nostro le viste superne {Par, xxm, 25-30) If, as a recent critic has suggested, the function of this metaphor is "purely emotional,"37 then it must be said that the emotion is that of all of Christendom, occasioned by the fulfillment of universal history. This moment in the poem marks the shift in the metaphor we have been discussing and in many others as well - perhaps of all of the astronomical metaphors of the Paradiso up to this point. The contrast is still between the "Sole de li Angeli" ("Un Sole . . .") and the "Sole sensibile" ("il nostro") but this time their functions are reversed: for the first time in the poem, the Sol Christi may be beheld by the pilgrim, while the material sun is simply a memory of the sphere and the world below. If that transcendent Sun is compared to the moon (Diana - Trivia) and the stars (ninfe) here in our world, it is because the mysterium Lunae, the Church, is all we have on this side of the frontiers of material reality to foreshadow the Triumph of Christ, a contingent, provisional image, like those of Paradiso x, until the break of eternal Day. I have tried to show that the traditional image of the Apostles and the Zodiac may be taken as the background for the controlling theme of Paradiso x and that the shift from Apostles to theologians and philosophers finds its counterpart in a shifting of the center from the Sun to Beatrice and the pilgrim or, according to one of the comparisons, the Moon. There are two additional reasons that can be adduced to support the hypothesis that this shift is implicitly from Christ to a traditional image for the Church. The first of these is that the comparison to the Moon surrounded by water vapor (expressed in terms subtly suggestive of generation and maternity: dngere, pregno, zona), like the faint suggestion of flowers and fields noticed by Aldo Scaglione in the Trivia image ("le ninfe etterne/ che dipingon lo ciel . . ." Cf. "le piante [di] questa ghirlanda," Par. x, 91)38 underscores precisely the elements of moon imagery which enabled early exegetes to identify the heavenly body with the Church. Rahner makes the point: What causes the Sun's light to grow more mild is that Selene mingles the fire of Helios with the water of her own being, and I might as well at this stage tell you more about the rioting fancies of Greek thought on the subject of "heavenly moonwater." Poets and 98</page><page sequence="15">Paradiso X: The Dance of the Stars, john freccero nature mystics produced an abundance of ideas about it, ideas which lingered on for a thousand years. . . . Selene becomes a giver of water, dew is created which she causes to drip down; ... it is a begetter of life upon the earth; it brings about the growth of the grass and the growth of beasts and makes it possible for human mothers to bear their children. ... In view of what has been said, it is not surprising that in seeking to give expression to his own beliefs the Christian should have made use of this lunar imagery with which the whole Hellenistic world was familiar.39 He then goes on to demonstrate how this imagery seemed perfect for conveying ideas about spiritual rebirth and the water of Baptism associated with the Church. The virgin goddess Diana (or "Trivia," to use Dante's name for her), in her role as moon mother, was transformed by Christianity into the image of Divine Maternity on earth: Mater Ecclesia. The second, much more obvious reason for thinking that the triumph of the theologians and philosophers is a Triumph of the Church fore- shadowing the Triumph of Sol Christi has already been mentioned, although in passing. It is simply this: the harmonic song produced by the dance of the philosophers and theologians is compared by the poet at the culminating point of the canto to the liturgical song of the Church, the eternal present marked by the hours of the day.40 By referring to this song in erotic terms (". . . la sposa di Dio surge/ a mattinar lo sposo perche Tami . . ." [Par. x, 140-141)] the poet binds into a single stunning unity not only Christ and His Church, Sun and Moon, Apostles and theologians, but also his own longing relationship to God, through the mediation of Beatrice. It would be foolhardy to generalize this mediation into an identification. We may say only that the mediation on the personal level, this man's salvation, finds its counterpart in human society in the role of the Church and for this reason Dante chose to use the traditional imagery of mediation to describe her. It is in this sense, as the relationship of incarnate reality to salvation history, that Beatrice may be said in this canto to be a figura Ecclesiae. The ending of the narrative and therefore of the canto calls our attention to Christ, the Second Person of the Trinity and the exemplar of all Wisdom - Somma Sapienza. The propriety of such an ending in the canto of the "spiriti sapienti" is too obvious to require extensive com- mentary. What is equally obvious, however, is that the beginning of the canto seems to have little to do with this ending, for all of the didactic insistence of the involved address to the reader. The opening lines of the 99</page><page sequence="16">Dante Studies, lxxxvi, 1968 canto hint at some of the most complicated of all problems of medieval thought: the inner life of the Trinity, its role in the creation, the relation- ship of the heavens to generation and corruption on earth and, finally, the relationship of all of these problems to the moral life. After touching upon all of these themes, the poet somewhat impatiently dismisses his reader: Or ti riman, lettor, sovra '1 tuo banco, dietro pensando a cio che si preliba, s'esser vuoi lieto assai prima che stance Messo t'ho innanzi: omai per te ti ciba ! che a se torce tutta la mia cura quella materia ond'io son fatto scriba. (Par. x, 22-27) It would take more than a lifetime to complete the task set for us in these lines and certainly more than this article to sketch out how this doctrinal passage serves to introduce not only the tenth canto, but the next four as well. To conclude this paper, however, I should like simply to point to a few elements of the opening verses that relate to my subject, the transla- tion of beatitude into astronomical terms. This will require first of all a return to our discussion of the relevance of the Platonic tradition to the canto's theme. The theme of the circular dance of the stars is a familiar one in the Timaeus. The phrase "choreae stellarum" used in the translation of Chalcidius is already a figurative application of the word meaning "choral dance" to the exigencies of astronomical description. In the com- mentary of Guillaume de Conches a definition is offered of the movement of the starry spheres that might equally well describe the dance of the "spiriti sapienti": "Et est chorea circularis motus cum concordi sono. Inde dicunt philosophi Stellas facere choream quia circulariter moventur et ex motu concordem reddunt sonum."41 Else- where, he identifies the music specifically as cantus*2 The song produced by the stellar dance is of course the music of the spheres, the music produced by the varying movements of the heavenly bodies, inaudible to mortal ears.43 The music of the Heaven of the Sun, "voce a voce in tempra," seems to have the same transcendent quality, for the poet twice insists that it cannot be heard here below (Par. x, 75 and 146). Of more importance for the association of these ancient, admittedly generic 100</page><page sequence="17">Paradiso X; The Dance of the Stars, john freccero themes with the tenth canto is the fact that it is the Sun, according to the Timaeus, that sets the standard of motion for all of the heavens by measuring time: And in order that there might be a conspicuous measure for the relative speed and slowness with which they moved in their eight revolutions [chorea], the god kindled a light in the ... Sun - in order that he might fill the whole heaven with his shining and that all living things for whom it was meet might possess number, learning it from the revolution of the same and uniform. Thus and for these reasons day night came into being, the period of the single and most intelligent revolution.44 It should be observed that the Sun has an equally regulatory function in Dante's metaphoric universe even down to the detail of the motion which it induces in the "spiriti sapienti." When their rank is doubled and the poet asks us to imagine two garlands circling about a center, the descrip- tion he gives us of their motion, as if Tuno andasse al prima e l'altro al poi" (Par. xm, 18), is part of the definition of time: "numero di movi- mento [celestiale] secondo prima e poi."45 Time may have its roots in the Primum Mobile, but its measure in hours and years is determined by the Sun. The centrality of the Sun and its essential role in the cosmos led very early, possibly with the Stoics, to the idea that it represented the location of the World Soul, the Anima Mundi, whose varied history in the Middle Ages, including identification with the Holy Spirit and then finally with the Goddess Natura, has been traced by Tullio Gregory.46 By Dante's time, of course, no Aristotelian could take the idea of a World Soul seriously, but a poet was perfectly free to do so and I have attempted in a previous study to outline what I take to be survivals of the idea in Dante's poem.47 In the present context, I should like simply to point out a poetic survival, not explicitly stated, in the form of an associative principle that binds together the introduction of the tenth canto with the narrative contained within it and relates both to the moral imperative of the journey. That associative principle finds its expression precisely in the address to the reader; when Dante asks the reader to look up at that critical point in the Zodiac he is in fact asking us to contemplate not only the image which underlies the narrative of the canto, as we have seen, but also the complex of themes traditionally associated with the Zodiac in the tradition of symbolic cosmology.48 The Zodiac was traditionally believed to be the emblem of the Creator's mark on the world and the IOI</page><page sequence="18">Dante Studies, lxxxvi, 896 1 seal of rationality both on man and on the heavens. So in the tenth canto, it is the sign of "quanto per mente e per loco si gira" (v. 4). The text that first associated the circular movement of rationality {per mente) and of the heavens (per loco) with the circularity of divinity was Plato's Timaeus. In his myth concerning the World Soul he tells how the Demiurge formed it by cutting a strip of "soul-stuff" in two and then crossed the two pieces in order to form the letter "X". He then bent up the two ends in order to form two hoops, one inside the other, setting them circling in opposite directions. After he was finished, he fashioned the soul of man in precisely the same manner. It was perfectly clear to subsequent commentators on Plato's text that the motions of the World Soul, for all of their apparently mythical character, were in fact derived from the two motions observable in the heavens: the diurnal circling of the Sun from East to West, marking the hours of the day, and the annual circling of the Sun in the opposite direction along the Zodiac, marking the months of the year. When the Sun crossed the equator at its point of intersection with the ecliptic, "dove Tun moto e l'altro si percuote," it was thought to occupy the central point of the Platonic "X" and thus to mark the spot where the Demiurge had set into motion both the soul of the world and the soul of man.49 Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy (m, m. 9) provided the Middle Ages with a most concise statement of the manner in which the universe bears the image of the Anima Mundi: You release the World Soul throughout the harmonious parts of the universe ... to give motion to all things. That soul, thus divided, pursues its revolving course in two circles, and, returning to itself, embraces the profound mind and transforms heaven to its own image.50 It remained only to identify the Demiurge with the Father, the profound mind with the Son and the World Soul with the Holy Spirit in order for Christians to see in both the heavens and the human mind the image of the Trinity.51 The history of the assimilation of the three Persons of the Trinity to Their Platonic counterparts is of course a substantial part of the history of Christian philosophy in the Middle Ages and especially in the twelfth century.52 What is of more concern to us here, however, is the assimila- tion of Platonic imagery to the Christian revelation. It happens that, from the earliest days of Christianity , the Platonic emblem of the Demiurge's creative act, the letter "chi" corresponding to the intersection of celestial 102</page><page sequence="19">Paradiso X: The Dance of the Stars, john freccero movement that Dante asks his reader to contemplate, was associated with the emblem of Christ and of His redemptive act: the cross. The history of that association has been traced by W. Bousset.523 Among the passages he cites, one is of particular interest to us, for it brings together the theme of Wisdom in the person of Christ and the theme of celestial harmony. The passage comes from the apocryphal Acts of John, quoted above in relation to the dance of the disciples. The Lord appears to John and shows him a celestial "cross of light" specifically distinguished from the true cross: This cross of light ... is the marking offof all things and the uplifting and the foundation of those things that are fixed and were unsettled, and the harmony of the wisdom - and indeed the wisdom of the harmony. . . . This, then, is the cross which fixed all things apart by the Word, and marked off the things from birth and below it, and then com- pacted all into one.52** In his commentary, Bousset has shown that this passage reflects a blending of the cosmological theme from the Timaeus with elements of the Gospel and of the Sapiential books of the Old Testament. He goes on to document the diffusion of the idea throughout the Patristic era and we may add to his findings that it survived well into the Middle Ages, for the association of the Platonic "X" with the cross reappears in the works of Peter Abaelard.52C The general relevance of these Christian accom- modations of Plato's text to a reading of the Paradiso is probably con- siderable - the cross of light in the Acts of John, for example, seems particularly suggestive for an interpretation of Dante's representation in the heaven of Mars. In the present context, however, the relevance is simply this: the history traced by Bousset provides an analogue to the opening verses of the tenth canto, wherein a glance up at the celestial "X" (the intersection of the equator and the ecliptic on the Zodiac) also serves to evoke the central mysteries of Christianity, through the mediation of Platonic myth. If both the movement of mind {per mente: the "spiriti sapienti") and the vital principle of the universe (the heavens and the "mondo che li chiama" - v. 15) can be encompassed by the same astronomical motif (the Sun and the Zodiac), it is by virtue of the Christianization of the Platonic theme of the Anima Mundi. The Platonic theme and its Christian elabora- tion, together with the glance up at the Zodiac which exemplifies the 103</page><page sequence="20">Dante Studies, lxxxvi, ig68 concepts they represent, provide us with a sufficient background for interpreting the entire introduction to the canto. The opening of the canto sets forth the two-fold movement of the three-fold Deity: Guardando nel Suo Figlio con TAmore che l'uno e Taltro etternamente spira, lo primo ed ineffabile Valore, quanto per mente o per loco si gira, con tant'ordine f e, ch'esser non puote sanza gustar di lui chi cio rimira. (Par. x, 1-6) Were it not for the standard Christian effort to re-establish equality in the hierarchical relationship of the One, Mind and Soul in a neoplatonic system, this opening might well be a paraphrase of Macrobius.53 At any rate, Dante intends here to set forth the two motions of the Trinity or, as he puts it in v. 51, "mostrando come spira e come figlia." These two motions, intellectual generation and the spiration of Love, volition, are the two motions in the Trinity which find their counterpart in the cosmos, "dove Tun moto e l'altro si percuote," insofar as the cosmos can reflect the inner life of the Trinity. Because of the way in which these two motions along the Zodiac affect all of creation, they are the instruments of God's Providence in the world (Par. x, 13-21).54 More than that, however, because of the parallelism previously mentioned, the motions are the exemplar of all created mind as well: whatever rotates per mente or per loco. It is for this reason that all mind and all of the heavens offer a foretaste of the Trinity. This, I take it, is the force of the word "dunque" in the address to the reader: "Leva dunque, Lettor, a Take ruote/ meco la vista" (w. 7-8). The call to look up at the heavens to contemplate the wonders of the creation is of course a familiar religious theme,55 but it is also a Platonic theme that fits in very well with the microcosmic-macrocosmic context of the opening lines. It is exactly in the context of the passage in Macrobius referred to above, reminiscent of the poet's Trinitarian opening, that the significance of the motif is clearly enunciated: Human bodies . . . were found to be capable of sustaining, with difficulty, a small part of it [the divinity of Mind], and only they, since they alone seemed to be erect - reaching toward heaven and shunning earth, as it were - and since only the erect can always gaze 104</page><page sequence="21">Paradiso X: The Dance of the Stars, john freccero with ease at the heavens; furthermore they alone have in their heads a likeness of a sphere ... the only one capable of containing mind.56 The glance up at the heavens is in this sense the fulfillment of human rationality. Finally, in order to end this paper and at the same time point to the ways in which its findings may be generalized to extend to the entire representation of the Heaven of the Sun, I should like for the last time to mention the circular dance of the star-souls. There are of course two motions described when all of the "spiriti sapienti" finally appear. We have discussed the two-fold motion of the Trinity, whereby it fglia and spira, with intellect and volition. We have suggested its analogies with the two-fold motion of the Sun along the Zodiac. It seems reasonable to assume that the Trinity is also the exemplar upon which the movement of the heavenly garlands57 is based. The repeatedly parallel syntax used to describe each pair of motions TAmore/ che Tuno a l'altro etternamente spira (Par. x, 1-2) dove Tun moto e l'altro si percuote (Par. x, 9) e Tun ne l'altro aver li raggi suoi (Par. xra, 16) leads one to suspect that the poet intends to associate the movement of the "spiriti sapienti" with the two-fold movement of the Trinity, comparing both to the two movements of the Zodiac. The suspicion is confirmed by the descriptions of the two wheels. The two movements of the Trinity (the generation of the Word and the spiration of Love) represent respectively an act of intelligence and an act of will. However else one divides the cast of characters in the Heaven of the Sun, there seems general agreement that the first circle represents intellectuals who shone with "cherubic splendor" and the second represents lovers who burned with "Seraphic ardor,"58 exemplifying respectively intelligence and will. The evidence of the zodiacal nature of the imagery beyond the tenth canto is equally clear, although perhaps not as widely recognized. First of all, as soon as the second circle appears, Dante describes the movement as that of a "mola" (Par. xn, 3), a mill-stone, the same word that he used in the Convivio in order specifically to distinguish zodiacal motion from generically circular motion.59 Again, he refers to the song of the souls as more beautiful than that of "nostre muse,/ nostre serene" (Par. xn, 7-8), 105</page><page sequence="22">Dante Studies, lxxxvi, 1968 the mythological goddesses who presided over the turning of the spheres.60 We have seen that the phrase "l'uno andasse al prima e l'altro al poi" (Par. xm, 18) recalls the measurement of time by celestial motion. Most convincing of all, perhaps, is the fact that the two accounts of the lives of the saints, obviously constructed in parallel, make reference to the course of the Sun at precisely the same verse - the "rising" of Francis is associated with the rising of the Sun, while the "rising" of Dominic is associated with its setting. At verse 51 ofParadiso xi, Dante describes Francis' birth as a sun coming to the world, "come fa questo tal volta di Gange." At verse 51 o£Paradiso xn, he describes the birth of Dominic as taking place near where "lo sol tal volta ad ogni uom si nasconde." This evidence would seem to indicate that the two-fold zodiacal motion constitutes the pattern even of the narrative portions of the succeeding cantos. When the third light appears above the other two, the "vero sfavillar del Santo Spiro" (Par. xiv, 76), we, like the pilgrim, are unable to make it out precisely. As the light appears, the poet's comparison is to twilight: £ si come al salir di prima sera comincian per lo ciel nove parvenze, si die la vista pare e non pare vera . . . (Par. xiv, 70-72) The pilgrim ascends almost immediately to the next heaven, as if he were not quite ready to see this celestial, but not yet Paradisiac triune light. In this metaphoric area that is Dante's own creation, somewhere between the daylight of earth and the daylight of eternity, the Sun with his two motions sets the scene for the revelation that is to follow. It is clear here, as it was in the Convivio, what that revelation will be, for, as Dante put it, "Nullo sensibile in tutto lo mondo e piu degno di farsi essemplo di Dio che '1 sole."61 Cornell University Ithaca, New York NOTES 1.

Ms. Troyes 13 81, fol. 57, published in part by C. Jourdain, "Des Commentaires inedits," Notices et Extraits de la Bibliotheque Imperiale, xx (Paris, 1865) pp. 77-78. The selection from the manuscript published by Jourdain concerning William's explanation of the myth of Orpheus is extremely suggestive for a reading of Canto dc, Inferno. William sees in the story of Eurydice an echo of Luke 9, 62, a passage frequently related to the story of Lot's wife turned to salt. According toj. Hatinguais ("En marge d'un poeme de Boece: Interpretation allegorique du mythe d'Orphee par Guillaume de Conches," Congres de Tours et Poitiers: Actes [Paris: "Belles Lettres," 1954], p. 285 ff.) the allegorical descent into Hell by Orpheus faces a "tentation du passe." So does the pilgrim when he comes upon Medusa. The echoes of the rime petrose in the rhyme words of Inf. rx, 50, 52, 54 (alto, smalto, assalto; cf. Rime, c, v. 58 ff.) suggest a "tentation du passe" that might well be glossed as William glosses the story of Orpheus. 8. The difficulty with any philosophical reconciliation stems from the fact that the Platonic myth suggests a decadence to the world of matter and hence a metaphysical dualism incompatible with Christianity. For the problem, see my "Dante's 'per se' Angel: The Middle Ground in Nature and in Grace," Studi danteschi, xxxix (1962), 5-38 (p. 13 ff.). 9.

Ernout and Meillet, in the Dictionnaire Etymologtque de la langue latine (Pans: Klincksieck, 195 1) s.v. acknowledge that "A sidus les anciens rattachaient deja considerare, desiderate" cf. Paulus Festus, 66, 7: "desiderare et considerare a sideribus dici certum est." But they then conclude "Ce sont sans doute d'anciens termes de la langue augurale." The Pythagorean idea of the intellectual quality of sidereal movement as enunciated by Timaeus (Timaeus 40 A ff.) seems to me a more plausible hypothesis, indicating a familiar moral distinction: desiderare=z fall to temporalia (Ernout and Meillet: "cesser de voir"). The moral force of consideratio seems to survive in the Middle Ages. See, for example, Johannes Sacrobosco, Sphaera n: "motus rationalis ... id est ... quando fit consideratio a creatore per creaturas in creatorem ibi sistendo," referring to the movement of the stars.

At any rate, there can scarcely be any doubt of the celestial associations in antiquity. Franz Boll's essay on the astronomical origins of the theme of contemplation ("Vita Contemplativa," Kleine Schriften zur Sternkunde des Altertums, ed. V. Stegemann [Leipzig: Koehler &amp; Amelang, 1950], pp. 303-331) has gathered together many texts suggesting the astronomical force of contemplatio (see below, note 56), some of which illustrate a similar force for consider atio\ see, for example, Cicero, Acad. n, 127: "Est enim animorum ingeniorumque naturale quoddam quasi pabulum consider atio contemplatioque naturae; erigimur, altiores fieri videmur, humana despicimus cogitantesque supera atque caelestia haec nostra ut exigua et minima contemnimus," Boll, p. 323. St. Bernard's treatise, De consideration (Patrologia Latina 182, 727), gave the word the technical force that it surely has, resonances apart, in Dante's description of Richard of St.-Victor, for whom, however, the key word was contemplatio.

I chose for an example the commentary published by E. T. Silk, Saeculi nonis Auctoris in Boetii Consolationem Philosophiae Commentarius (Rome: American Academy, 1935): for the association of Mind with the Son, see p. 175: "Dicit Boetius mundum PERPETUA RATIONE regi, quia intellexit ilium per sapientiam Dei, id est per Filium Dei, non tantum factum esse sed etiam gubernari." For the various arguments in the controversy concerning the identification of Anima with the Holy Spirit, see Gregory, p. 146 ff. 52. Z.

See Macrobius, Commentary on the Dream ofScipio, trans. W. H. Stahl (New York: Columbia University Press, 1952), p. 142 ff. and Stahl's notes. 54. For the astronomical details of zodiacal inclinations, its effects and its sources, see the parallel discussions in the Convivio m, v, 23 ff. and Busnelli-Vandelli notes ad loc. See also below, note 56. 55. For the religious theme of the glance up at the sun, see Dolger, Sol Salutis, cit., especially chapter 18: "Sursum corda und der Aufblick zum Himmel." 56. Macrobius 1, 14; Stahl, p. 144. It is in this chapter that Macrobius derives contemplatio from "the temple of God.*' See Stahl, p. 142 and notes. Dante echoes the tradition in Par. xxvm, 53 : "questo miro e angelico templo." The poet seems to blend elements of both the Platonic and religious traditions when he describes the divine providence of the two-fold motion: "O ineffabile sapienza che cosi ordinasti . . .! E voi a cui utilitade e diletto io scrivo, in quanta cechitade vivete, non levando li occhi suso a queste cose, tenendoli fissi nel fango de la vostra stoltezza!" (Convivio m, v, 22). 57. The circular movement of a "corona" (Ariadne's garland - corona borealis, Par. xm, 14-15) is identified as the movement of the Zodiac by Remi d'Auxerre's commentary of Martianus Capella (1, 30.14): "per coronam, zodiacus ... in modum coronae spheram caelestem quasi Iovis verticem cingit."

Par. xi, 37-39: L'un fu tutto serafico in ardore; l'altro per sapienza in terra fiie di cherubica luce uno splendore. The source of the exhortation to conform human conduct to the angelic hierarchies is Gregory the Great, In Evangel, sermo XXXIV (Patrologia Latina 76, 1252). Alanus ab Insulis identifies the Seraphim with "viri contemplativi qui divino amori omnino sunt dediti, ut viri claustrales," while the Cherubim are the "magistri in sacra pagina," Hierarchia Alani, Alain de Lille, Textes inidits, ed. M. T. d'Alverny (Etudes de Philosophic Me*dieVale, in; Paris: Vrin, 1965), pp. 230-231. See d'Alverny's comments, p. 107. The importance of the comparison is not only doctrinal but poetic as well, for the angels are in fact the archetype for the circular movement of the blessed in the Empyrean, see Freccero, Final Image, cit. Furthermore, they are in fact the movers of the Primum Mobile and the sphere of the fixed stars respectively, i.e., the intelligences which cause the celestial movement which is the counterpart of this movement in the physical world. 59.
