<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Aperspectival Objectivity to Strong Objectivity: The Quest for Moral Objectivity JENNIFER TANNOCH-BLAND Sandra Hrding is working on the reconstruction of scientific objectivity. Lorraine Daston argues that objectivity is a concept that has historically evolved. Her account of the development of "aperspectival objectivity" provides an opportunity to see Harding's "strong objectivity" project as a stage in this evolution, to locate it in the history of migration of ideals from moral philosophy to natural science, and to support Harding's desire to retain something of the ontological significance of objectivity. Yes, Alice, there is a mind independent reality. There must be, or you wouldn't be looking for it. The innocent Alice in the Wonderland of feminist postmodemism is likely to have questioned the very possibility of objective knowledge.1 She might have doubted the basic premise of Western scientific rationality, that there is a mind-independent world which Western science attempts to understand (Hawkesworth 1990; Hekman 1990; Searle 1993; Vaux 1994). The pseudoquote above reflects the observation that in feminist work on episte- mology there has been a recent "return to the notion of objectivity as a procedure that enables access to an existing, objective and knowable world" (Welton 1994, 16).2 In particular, Sandra Harding is an influential feminist epistemologist who, in asserting the political and scientific value of "situated knowledges" (Haraway 1991), offers the notion of gaining "strong objectivity" through "starting thought from marginal lives" (Harding 1993). First, I want to argue that we should see objectivity as a concept that has historically evolved, and that Harding's work on the objectivity ideal can be seen as another stage in this evolution. In this respect, the work of Lorraine Daston on the history of the concept of objectivity warrants attention. Daston Hypatia vol. 12, no. 1 (Winter 1997) ? by Jennifer Tannoch-Bland</page><page sequence="2">Hypatia argues that scientific objectivity is historically tripartite: its meanings are metaphysical, methodological, and moral. She maintains that aperspectival objectivity, which is about eliminating individual (or occasionally group) idiosyncrasies, and which dominates current notions of objectivity, did not appear in science until the mid-nineteenth century, having emigrated from moral and aesthetic philosophy (Daston 1992, 597). In line with this argument, my second assertion is that the particular evolution of the notion of aperspectival objectivity involved the migration of ideals from moral philosophy to natural science; and in this sense, historically, oughts have informed ises. Significantly, Harding's strong objectivity can be seen as a particular version of just such a migration. Daston's historical perspective provides an opportunity to clarify, contextualize, and support the feminist standpoint attempt to reformulate objectivity. I will contend that Harding's ideal of strong objectivity, like the aperspectival objectivity ideal, grows out of an ethical imperative, in this case to pursue greater justice through accessing greater "truth." When we understand that scientific objectivity is "neither monolithic nor immutable" (Daston 1992, 597) but a continually evolving historical construct, we are better able to appreciate and assess the strong objectivity ideal in the context of this evolution. Besides offering a historical analysis of the evolution of the concept of objectivity, Daston specifically locates the origin of the dominant notion of objectivity in moral philosophy. Therefore her account has particular relevance for Har- ding, whose work on the strong objectivity ideal exists in the realm of moral philosophy. Third, I argue that Harding, in claiming that strong objectivity will separate the ises from the oughts, is seeking a notion of objectivity that retains an empiricist-realist core. Thus, in spite of the infusion of fact with value (is infused by ought), I want to draw on Daston's work to support Harding's argument that we can still hold onto something of the ontological significance of objectivity; that is, the "old" meaning of objectivity, a notion of accessing "how in fact [the world] is" (Harding 1993, 72). In stating the case thus far, I have already used several terms-postmodern- ism, objectivity, rationality, science, observation, feminist, epistemology, knowledge and truth-that have become sites of contest in and outside of feminist theory. In particular, the feminist epistemologies are criticized on the grounds that they refer to situated knowledges and not the theory of knowledge in general; that they are mere justificatory strategies and sociologies of knowledge; that they are too indebted to the patriarchal theories from which they borrow- empiricism, Marxism, and postmodernism.3 Furthermore that they are too essentialist; that they are Eurocentric, ethnocentric, relativist, and regressively foundational4 (Harding 1991, 49). The exploration of these sites of contest is outside the scope of the present exercise. 156</page><page sequence="3">Jennifer Tannoch-Bland Without denying the importance of these concerns, I suggest that, for the purposes of this paper, feminist epistemology is best understood as a project. As part of this work-in-progress, some theorists are extending earlier feminist investigations of the concept of objectivity (Bordo 1987; Fee 1981; Grosz 1987; Haraway 1989; Hartsock 1983; Hawkesworth 1994; Keller 1987; Longino 1990; Ring 1987; Rose 1987; Ruddick 1993). At the same time they are exploring "what ought to be done about epistemological principles," in order to make better (in the sense of less distorted) knowledge that can reflect feminist concerns (Code 1994; Harding 1991; Welton 1994). This raises Hume's problem of the logical jump from an is to an ought, the so-called naturalistic fallacy, but feminism is a political movement, and in much of the feminist work in epistemology the aim is to move from a moral imperative toward a greater degree of truth, not in the other direction. So there is a sense in which Hume's problem is turned on its head. An approach to this area as work-in-progress locates it in, and attempts to link, its scientific axiological and moral axiological contexts.5 It is my aim in this paper to contribute to the continuation of the critique of objectivity that feminists have undertaken, with an eye to rehabilitating the concept in ways that might be useful to feminist projects. APERSPECTIVAL OBJECTIVITY Let us now explore Daston's revelation of the separate but confused (and fused) histories of the three meanings of objectivity. Contrary to "conven- tional histories," which see objectivity as having a birthday, usually a Cartesian one, "when it allegedly arrives on the scene full-grown and in full armour, like Athena from the head of Zeus," Daston's account sees a complex development. She contends that even feminist histories assume "that objectivity is and has been a monolithic and immutable concept, at least since the seventeenth century" (Daston 1992, 598).6 In Daston's schema objectivity's earliest meaning is metaphysical. Medieval and early modem uses of the concept of "objectivity" lacked connotations of "impartiality and disinterestedness." What Daston calls ontological objectiv- ity "pursues the ultimate structure of reality;" it is about "the fit between theory and the world." In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, objectivity retained this ontological import: there were "degrees" of objective or "intrinsic" reality, and objective truth was "the reality or possibility of the object itself" (Daston 1992, 597, 600-601). It seems, then, that Daston's ontological objectivity is concerned with the ontological question of what is, and assumes a mind-independent reality. Daston argues that Kant's combination of "the ontological meaning of a shared object, the epistemological meaning of shared reason, and the social meaning of shared information under the rubric of the 'objective,' invited a 157</page><page sequence="4">Hypatia blurring of these distinctions, and proved prophetic of things to come." It was the creative misunderstanding of Kant by people like Coleridge, moreover, that crystallized an opposition of objective and subjective. Daston therefore draws three conclusions about scientific objectivity during this period. First, it "concerned ontology, and, post-Kant, to some measure epistemology in a transcendental vein," having nothing to do with emotional detachment, restraint from judgement, methodology, or empirical reliability.7 Second, its inseparable opposite, subjectivity in the sense of the mental, had no negative connotations. This seems reasonable. Though Kant addressed the epistemo- logical (and hence normative) question of how we can justify knowledge claims about what there is, objectivity was guaranteed because we are all operating with the same a priori cognitive structures. So subjectivity was not a barrier to objectivity. Indeed, Daston notes that Coleridge branded our "instinctive belief in the existence of things independent of us a 'prejudice,' and thought the highest perfection of natural philosophy would consist in the perfect spiritualization of the laws of nature into the laws of intuition and intellect." Daston's third conclusion is that perspective was not yet addressed (Daston 1992, 598, 602-3, 606). To return to Descartes, Daston argues that for him objectivity retained traces of its older, ontological import. It was only when subjectivity in the sense of the mental came to be seen as unsavory that moral philosophers began to speculate on the problem of perspective, which led to the formulation of the disinterestedness ideal and aperspectival objectivity. Daston argues that Descartes did not see subjectivity in the sense of the mental as a matter for regret or reproach, and that there was at that stage no evidence of the move to overcome it (Daston 1992, 598-603).8 Classifying the three kinds of scientific objectivity by the different sub- jectivities they oppose, Daston argues that by the mid-nineteenth century ontological objectivity had come to oppose subjective consciousness (or the mental) per se, because it was about passive, represented, nonconscious nature as opposed to the active, representing, conscious self or intelligence. Mechan- ical objectivity, which involved "suppressing the universal human propensity to judge and aestheticize," opposed "subjective interpretation." It concerned procedures, devices, and mechanisms designed to eradicate interpretation in "reporting and picturing scientific results." And aperspectival objectivity opposed the "subjectivity of individual idiosyncrasies." Though objectivity for us has a "thick layering of [these] oddly matched meanings," aperspectival objectivity has come to dominate current usage; it is therefore most relevant to this paper (Daston 1992, 597-99, 602, 607). Aperspectival objectivity, in Daston's account, emerged first "in the moral and aesthetic philosophy of the late eighteenth century" as an attempt "to make shared, public knowledge possible" through enlisting the virtues of "detachment, impartiality, disinterestedness, even self-effacement." Daston 158</page><page sequence="5">Jennifer Tannoch-Bland discusses Hume's aesthetic version of aperspectival objectivity. In judging works of art, Hume recommended that the peculiarities of an individual's "natural position" must be subdued by "forgetting" oneself in order to attain "the true standard." But he also recommended that the critic cultivate "per- spectival suppleness, the ability to assume myriad other points of view." Though Daston distinguishes Hume's "perspectival suppleness" from what Nagel terms the "view from nowhere," she claims the step from "empathic virtuosity to detached objectivity was a short one" (Daston 1992, 603-4). Adam Smith made that step in his Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) in which he "blames deviation from the 'true' moral standard on the prejudices of an unsuitable perspective, self-interest being at once the worst and most common of these perspectival distortions" (Daston 1992, 605). Subjectivity had become unsavory; perspective was seen as a barrier to truth. Daston goes on to argue that just as eighteenth-century moral philosophers deemed aperspectival objectivity a "precondition for a just and harmonious society," so some nineteenth-century philosophers deemed it "a precondition for a coher- ent scientific community." The existence of such a community, moreover, "seemed a precondition for-or even an eventual guarantee of-reaching scientific truth" (Daston 1992, 604-7). It was in the middle decades of the nineteenth century that, because of "vast changes in the organization of science, both at a global and local level," the aperspectival ideal moved to science. The "bustle of scientific communica- tion," albeit made possible in part by technological developments, resulted primarily from the "communicable knowledge" or "shared public knowledge" imperative.9 Compared with the scientific province of the eighteenth-century Republic of Letters, scientific life became "more impersonal," based on "increasingly narrow and formal" relationships.10 In the new "democracy of scientific observers" the interchangeable, impersonal observer, "all too often the lowest common denominator observer," replaced the skilled, known and trusted observer. Skill had become "too aristocratic a trait." Charles Babbage, for instance, touted the accuracy of Gaspard Prony's "human computers," and Claude Bernard thought "an uneducated man" would be a less biased recorder of experimental results. The "contraction of nature to the communicable" had become standard practice among scientists; the scientific ethos of aperspecti- val objectivity had arrived (Daston 1992, 608-9, 611-12). Insofar as the evolution of the notion of aperspectival objectivity involved the migration of ideals from moral philosophy to science, we can say that historically, oughts informed ises. This insight will become relevant when we turn later to Harding's project. These nineteenth-century changes in science meant that the objectively real became "that which eliminates individual idiosyncrasy through the pro- longed 'averaging' of viewpoints by communication." Thus it was at this time that the very communicability of knowledge across boundaries became inti- 159</page><page sequence="6">Hypatia mately linked to the virtue of disinterestedness. According to Daston, then, the essence of aperspectival objectivity is "communicability, narrowing the range of genuine knowledge to coincide with that of public knowledge." In some cases, "aperspectival objectivity may even sacrifice deeper or more accurate knowledge to the demands of communicability." For instance, in medicine, astronomy, and other sciences, the problems of "communicating skill and judgment acquired through long experience" were met by turning to statistical methods to standardize results in a form immediately accessi- ble to others. The net result was often a loss of information that had previously been an integral part of the observation report. Clearly Daston's "public knowledge" means nonelitist knowledge. Aperspectival objectivity took science out of the control of skilled "aristocratic" practitioners and into the realm of democratic institutions.1 Significant costs of democratic communicability were accuracy-or a degree of truth-and skill (Daston 1992, 600, 607-9, 611-12). I am not suggesting that we take Daston's tripartite model of objectivity and use it as a sort of Procrustean bed, attempting to make Harding's account of objectivity fit. Rather, I suggest that with a historically sensitive understanding of the layered structure of the notion of objectivity, we are now better equipped to study Harding's ideal of strong objectivity in the context of the history of objectivity. The relevance of Daston's history, as opposed to other histories, for Harding's project lies in her identification of aperspectival objectivity, which has come to dominate current usage, and particularly in her argument that it originated in moral philosophy and migrated to science. This argument pro- vides the opportunity to see that historically, ideals have migrated from moral philosophy to science, and to see Harding's strong objectivity as a particular version of such a migration. Also, if aperspectival objectivity was not among the meanings of objectivity in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century science, and if objectivity has not always meant aperspectival objectivity, then both science and objectivity are imaginable without it. We should now explore Harding's imagining. STRONG OBJECTIVITY Before addressing her approach to strong objectivity, I will attempt to locate it on the spectrum of feminist philosophy of science. It is significant that Harding herself offers the tools to do this. In The Science Question in Feminism, she identified three separate categories of feminist epistemologies. Of these, feminist empiricism and feminist standpoint theory are "feminist successor science" projects, aiming to reconstruct the original goals of modem science. In contrast, feminist postmodernism challenges those goals (S. Harding 1986, 24, 142). Harding's taxonomy has become standard in feminist work on epistemol- ogy. In her recent attempt to "rethink" standpoint epistemology, she has 160</page><page sequence="7">Jennifer Tannoch-Bland sought to "follow the logic of the standpoint approaches into postmoderist terrains" (Harding 1991; 1993; 1994a).12 Harding asserts that standpoint theory can increase objectivity. Insofar as values that have shaped the sciences pass unexamined through the scientific process to distort our understanding of nature and ourselves, objectivity is impoverished and weak. Though Western science presents itself as the disem- bodied report of value-free, context-independent facts, its subject is always embodied and historically located. Only by "starting thought from marginalized lives" can we systematically reveal and eliminate the background beliefs that are invisible to scientists, and thereby strengthen objectivity (Harding 1993, 52, 55-57, 63).13 Let us now try to understand what Harding is claiming for objectivity. Identifying marginalized lives "as a source of objectivity-maximizing ques- tions," Harding theorizes the inescapable "social situatedness" of knowledge claims as a "systematically available scientific resource." Scientists must think from the perspective of the other to uncover their own invisible or unrecog- nized biases in research.14 Thus she is not claiming the "unique abilities of the oppressed to produce knowledge."15 On the contrary, marginalized lives hold questions, not answers, providing the "scientific problems and the research agendas-not the solutions-for standpoint theories."16 Nor is she making the simplistic claim that multiple perspectives, or even intersubjectivity, quantita- tively increase objectivity. Insofar as she sees marginalized lives as a resource "for everyone's research and scholarship," Harding is calling also for the cross- fertilization of marginalized perspectives. For instance, analyses of class rela- tions must look at their agendas from the perspective of women's lives, as, say, John Stuart Mill was able to do. Thus, in much the same way that to nine- teenth-century philosophers, aperspectival philosophy seemed a prerequisite for a coherent scientific community and thereby for the production of scien- tific truth, so Harding sees the standpoint epistemological goal of "socially situated knowledges" as a prerequisite for the maximization of truth content of all knowledge claims (Harding 1993, 54, 58, 62, 67, 74). In its attempt to make the "context of discovery" accessible to systematic scientific examination, Harding's process requires that "the subject of knowl- edge be placed on the same critical, causal plane as the objects of knowledge." It seems here that Harding is referring to the strong and systematic reflexivity involved in her program. Once scientists "achieve" and use other standpoints to reveal the communal bias and distortion in their existing knowledge, they become both the subject and object of knowledge "from the perspective of the scientific method." Harding asserts a "causal symmetry" whereby the "same kinds of social forces that shape objects of knowledge also shape (but do not determine) knowers and their scientific projects." She insists that trees, rocks, planetary orbits, and electrons always appear to natural scientists only as they are already socially constituted. Scientists' assumptions about what they see are 161</page><page sequence="8">Hypatia always shaped by "conversations" they carry on with scientists of the past. Their own interactions with such objects also culturally constitute them. In that the subjects of knowledge are embodied and historically located, "they are not fundamentally different from objects of knowledge," which are "determi- nate in space and time." Even in the natural sciences, subject and object of knowledge are not significantly different in kind, because here nature is "an object of knowledge" not a thing in itself.17 The strong objectivity approach locates the "very assumed difference between subject and object of knowledge in social history" (Harding 1993, 56, 64, 69, 73). Even though Daston is not concerned with a project to create subject and object on the same causal plane, her thesis does exemplify the idea that cognitive history necessarily involves social history. For Harding the objectivist notion of a "value-free, impartial, dispassionate objectivity" is much too narrow "to permit the achievement of the value-free research that is supposed to be its outcome." She sees the attempt to maximize value-neutral objectivity as ahistorical, in that it "implies that human ideas can somehow escape their location in human history." At the same time, she emphasizes "the sometimes positive influence of social values and interests in the content of science." In particular, she claims that "democracy-advancing values have systematically generated less partial and distorted beliefs than others" (Harding 1991, 138, 141; 1993, 70-73). Ironically, if Daston is right, it was a democracy-advancing value that generated the belief in aperspectival objectivity! The point here is what Harding is doing to "value-neutral objec- tivity." In peeling "value-neutral" from "objectivity," she, and feminist stand- point epistemology generally, are separating what has been joined by convention for more than a century.18 The neutrality ideal seems to be Harding's target when she says that strong reflexivity will be "a resource for objectivity, in contrast to the obstacle that de facto reflexivity has posed to weak objectivity" (Harding 1993, 71). She seems to be saying that whereas the discovery that science is not value-free (de facto reflexivity) has been seen as a problem for the objectivity of objectivism (weak objectivity), a systematic program of strong reflexivity will actually increase objectivity in the sense of accessing greater truth. Thus she seems to be trying to recast objectivity as a process rather than a state of mind. Harding claims that when the notion of objectivity is "transformed into 'strong objectivity'. . . it retains central features of the older conception." I suggest that she wants to retain some of its ontological meaning, as well as the democratic communicability ideal. In her view, the notion of objectivity is "useful in providing a way to think about the gap that should exist between how any individual or group wants the world to be [oughts] and how in fact it is [ises]" (Harding 1993, 72). In other words, what are taken to be facts are always located in an epistemological framework, and when the dominant epistemological framework is invisible, its oughts are taken to be ises. In effect, 162</page><page sequence="9">Jennifer Tannoch-Bland she is proposing that strong objectivity will provide a way conceptually to separate the ises from the oughts; that current ises are informed by oughts; and more than this, that oughts can be ises is disguise. Laura Sells addresses the problem of the invisibility of the dominant epistemological framework when she argues that the "dominant perspective [of elite-bourgeois, heterosexist, white men] is often an 'ought,' not an 'is,' but because of its dominance... the 'ought' becomes an is' " (Sells 1993, 206). According to Harding's account, overtly racist, sexist, classist, and heterosexist claims have the effect of insist- ing that the dominant culture is superior (Harding 1993, 60). It is in this sense that the ought becomes an is19 Harding maintains that strong objectivity offers some standard by which to say that one story of the world is a "better belief" than another, and it is therefore Harding's answer to feminism's concerns about relativism (Harding, 54, 56). Thus it is not a particular standpoint but standpoint theory that, through strong objectivity and reflexivity, reveals the partiality of prefer- ence or bias. Insofar as it overtly claims an ought and reveals the dominant is as often an ought in disguise, strong objectivity does allow us conceptually to separate the ises from the oughts. But Harding's strong objectivity goes further than this: it seeks simultaneously to make visible its epistemological framework and to influence scientific practice. Strong objectivity repre- sents an ideal that has emerged in moral philosophy; Harding's goal is to see it migrate to the sciences. In this way it will continue the historical process by which oughts inform ises. To return to Harding's "older conception" of objectivity and this idea of "how in fact [the world] is," her objectivity involves a notion of correspon- dence, or fit with the world20 Though wary of the objectivist implications of insisting on a mind-independent real world, Harding is struggling to articulate a notion of objectivity that retains an empiricist-realist core and that posits truth as a matter of degree. When she speaks of "more objective, less false," clearly truth is a matter of degree.*2 Her objectivity will not be about a passive, represented nature but about constituting and socially constituted subjects and objects. Because even intersubjectivity cannot guarantee objectivity, she advo- cates a rigorous "logic of discovery" involving systematic, strong reflexivity, based on the premise that all knowledge is situated (Harding 1993, 24, 56). It is time to shift our focus from Harding to general feminist work in this area. THE QUEST FOR MORAL OBJECTIVITY Feminist philosophers of science are in departments of philosophy, science, science and technology, politics, education, medicine, public health, women's studies, mathematics, humanities, psychology, primatology, and sociology. But their work differs from other work in most of these departments in that it is avowedly political. Linked to its political imperative is a normative ethical 163</page><page sequence="10">Hypatia dimension (Alcoff and Potter 1993, 11). Daston's work in unraveling objectivity's complex historical web reveals the normative ethical dimension that has infused the philosophy of science at earlier periods.22 Feminists working in epistemology, in stretching toward an ethic on which to ground a feminist science, are in fact doing what earlier philosophers have done. In particular, this current standpoint objectivity project is, in a sense, linked to the nineteenth-century project-again, it is a democratic move. Then, objec- tivity was revisualized as a result of a moral and political impetus to democra- tize science, and this seemed a precondition for reaching scientific truth. This time, the aim is to gain less biased knowledge of the world, and this is linked directly to an ethicopolitical, emancipatory imperative. We can thus discern a continuity between feminist standpoint epistemology and nineteenth-century philosophy of science.23 For feminist standpoint epistemology there are at least six significant impli- cations of Daston's work. First, it means that science with objectivity redefined is imaginable. Second, because objectivity is a concept that has historically evolved, Harding's work on the objectivity ideal can be seen as another stage in this evolution. Third, if the evolution of aperspectival objectivity involved the migration of ideals from moral philosophy to science, Harding's strong objectivity can be seen as an instance of such a migration. Fourth, if in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, scientists operated with a more metaphysical, as opposed to moral or methodological, notion of objectivity, this validates Harding's desire to retain something of the ontological meaning of objectivity. Fifth, it forces us to rethink the consequences of the loss of the Cartesian birth of full-blown objectivity. Sixth, it problematizes Harding's project: it shows how the very communicability of knowledge across bound- aries became so intimately linked to the virtue of disinterestedness that the two transmuted into aperspectival objectivity. While throwing out the bath water of aperspectival objectivity, can Harding save the baby of democratic commu- nicability? It is important that this problematization of Harding's project opens the way to rethinking both Daston and Harding. REWORKING DASTON According to Daston, the whole point of aperspectival objectivity was to make shared public knowledge possible; the virtue of disinterestedness was enlisted in the democratic project of communicability of knowledge. For Har- ding, the whole point of strong objectivity is to produce knowledge that is more true in the sense of less distorted. This impetus lies in a recognition that the neutrality ideal, while failing to produce value-free knowledge (which in any case is both undesirable and impossible), has been instrumental in the oppression of marginalized peoples. So where Daston sees the essence of the prevailing notion of objectivity as the communicability ideal (Daston 1992, 164</page><page sequence="11">Jennifer Tannoch-Bland 600), Harding sees its essence as the neutrality ideal. Harding does not emphasize an ideal of communicability, but clearly she would not want to attack it. Since communicability is crucial to an emancipatory project that seeks specifically to transcend boundaries of race, color, class, nationality, power, and gender, we might question the utility of Daston's thesis to Harding's project.24 In short, because aperspectival objectivity involves the prolonged averaging of viewpoints by communication (Daston 1992, 607), these two elements of aperspectival objectivity may appear inextricable. But the averaging of view- points is not the only possible answer to the moral problem of perspective. Harding's response is the notion of a cross-fertilized, enriched, responsible, systematized perspective linked to the democratic communicability ideal. I suggest that if we talk in terms of the disinterestedness ideal and the commu- nicability ideal instead of aperspectival objectivity per se, we can restate Daston's thesis in a form more useful to Harding's project. To say simply that aperspectival objectivity emigrated to science from moral philosophy in the nineteenth century is slightly misleading. The communica- bility ideal had existed in science since the time of Bacon.25 I suggest, therefore, that what emigrated to science from moral philosophy in the mid-nineteenth century was what I will call the disinterestedness ideal; that is, the notion of enlisting the virtuous ideals of "detachment, impartiality, disinterestedness, even self-effacement" in the service of the scientific communicability ideal (Daston 1992, 603),26 The disinterestedness ideal, grafted onto the scientific communicability ideal, transmuted into the aperspectival ideal. So though aperspectival objectivity, on Daston's account, did emerge first in moral phi- losophy, in its scientific debut the part of it that was new to science was the disinterestedness ideal. This rewriting provides an opportunity to imagine the communicability ideal in historical isolation from aperspectival objectivity, a move that, despite her relative silence on the subject, is crucial to Harding's reformulation of objectivity, given the democratic nature of her project. When Peter Dear claims that scientific objectivity moved from truth to disinterestedness in the seventeenth century, we must be careful to distinguish this from the disinterestedness ideal, which first emerged in eighteenth-century moral philosophy. Dear is describing the move away from the ontological meaning of objectivity (supported by the scholastic institutions) to the idea of knowledge as "disinterested plausibility," with "degrees of certainty" (Dear 1992, 621-28). In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the idea of objective knowledge involved an argument about the kind of person who was making the judgment. For example, Kepler accepted Galileo's arguments in the Sidereal Messenger on the grounds of his character.27 A general conception formed of the scientist as a morally superior person (Dubos 1961, 152-53; Outram 1978). Adam Smith endorsed this myth in his Theory of Moral Sentiments, which had a wide circulation (Smith 1976 [1759], 20, 125). The 165</page><page sequence="12">Hypatia moral person, moreover, was the objective person, because he was the truth teller (Dear 1992, 619,626; Outram 1989, 20,30; Shapin 1988, 1992). All this seems to support Daston's thesis that it was in the realm of moral philosophy, not science, that the subjective first "acquired an unsavory odor" (Daston 1992, 606). It appears that seventeenth-century scientific disinterestedness, unlike eighteenth-century moral disinterestedness and unlike twentieth-century aperspectival objectivity, was not about the rejection of unsavory subjectivity. It was not an ideal to be striven for; and because it was bestowed by others, I suggest it might more aptly be termed the plausibility criterion. Dear's disinter- estedness, therefore, is quite distinct from Adam Smith's moral disinterested- ness, an ideal that was a response to the problem posed by perspective once subjectivity became unsavory. It is this moral disinterestedness ideal that informs modem science (see Appendix). I venture to suggest that the "crite- rion of trustworthiness" (Dear 1992, 619) informing seventeenth- and eigh- teenth-century science may even have informed something like "perspectival objectivity" at the time. HARDING AND PERSPECTIVE Whereas Harding is not pursuing a notion of trustworthiness, she is seeking to remake the scientist into an ethical knower; she is pursuing an "ethic of responsibility" (Harding 1991, 38, 290; 1994a). And in rejecting neutrality, she is, in one sense, proposing that there could be something like "perspectival objectivity."28 This would not be the perspectival objectivity Adam Smith associated with self-interest, but cross-fertilized, enriched, responsible per- spectival objectivity, achieved through a rigid logic of discovery. Though the notion of perspectival objectivity seems at first oxymoronic, when we reflect that Nagel's "view from nowhere" is also oxymoronic, we begin to see that the difficulty lies in the expectations we hold of objectivity. Daston has suggested how these expectations are historically related to notions of truth, public knowledge, intersubjectivity, nonsubjectivity, disinterested- ness, the repression of the emotions, morality, rationality, and the mental (Daston 1992, 597-98).29 If we accept that there can be no objectivity without an objectifying subject, we see the "view from nowhere" as not only oxymoro- nic but an impossibility.30 If objectivity necessarily involves subjectivity, then perspectival objectivity, through its oxymoronic connotations, becomes a way of expressing the recognition that there is always a knowing, embodied, historically and socially situated subject of knowledge, and that all knowledge claims "bear the fingerprints of the communities that produce them" (Harding 1993, 57). According to Harding, the implications of strong objectivity for feminist practice are clear if we are to "distinguish between feminism and the narrow 166</page><page sequence="13">Jennifer Tannoch-Bland self-interest of dominant-group women" (Harding 1993, 66-67). We can see here that Harding echoes Adam Smith's moral concern about self-interest. Where his response was the disinterestedness ideal, which in Daston's account transmuted into aperspectival objectivity, Harding's response is almost the opposite. Recognizing the danger of aperspectival objectivity, she opts instead for a reintegration of perspective, of the embodied, historically situated sub- ject, even of the moral scientist. As in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-cen- tury science, there is a sense in which the moral, responsible person will be the objective scientist, the truth teller. OUGHTS AND ISES Harding's strong objectivity, insofar as it overtly claims an ought and reveals the dominant is to be an ought in disguise, reaches toward a morally valid objectivity. If Daston is right, this quest for a morally valid objectivity has a history. If, historically, oughts have informed ises, the continuing construction of the "objectivity" ideal has been, and will continue to be, informed by moral imperatives. Thus the logical jump from an is to an ought is a problem precisely because, while we seem always compelled to attempt this logical jump, we are always also moving in the opposite direction. In other words, our is chickens are necessarily informed by ought eggs. There is a sense, therefore, in which the production of an ought from an is is an organic and cyclic matter rather than a logical and linear matter. Given this analysis, epistemology involves values. Ontology necessarily involves epistemology; Stanley and Wise call the two "symbiotic" (1993, 223). Ontology therefore also involves values.31 This insight removes the inhibition from Harding's desire to retain some of the ontological significance of objec- tivity; that is, the "old," metaphysical meaning of objectivity. That is, in spite of the infusion of fact with value, we can still retain a notion of correspon- dence, or fit with the world. Concerning the production of ises, we should note Alan Chalmers's argu- ment that when scientists make choices, all the important determinations have already occurred (Chalmers 1990, 116). This is precisely why feminist standpoint epistemologists are seeking to change those important determina- tions that have always "already occurred." In stretching toward a reformula- tion of objectivity itself-one that requires that "scientists and their communities be integrated into democracy-advancing projects for scientific and epistemological reasons as well as moral and political ones" (Harding 1993, ,69)-they are seeking to influence these important determinations which always precede the choices of individual scientists.32 167</page><page sequence="14">Hypatia CONCLUSION This paper has not explored the work by Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison (1992) on developments in mechanical objectivity in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.33 Because Harding seems to be trying to recast objectivity as a process rather than a state of mind, the relationship between mechanical objectivity and aperspectival objectivity holds great potential relevance to her project.34 I have not sought to provide a critique of Sandra Harding's standpoint epistemology. Instead, accepting her moral axiology, I have been interested in exploring her claims for objectivity in the light of the history of objectivity. Where conventional histories do not shed much light on her strong objectivity project, Lorraine Daston identifies aperspectival objectivity as dominating current usage and argues that it emerged from the conjunction of moral, political, and methodological imperatives with the vast changes in the organi- zation of science in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. Daston's thesis allows us to locate Harding's strong objectivity ideal historically. Similarly, I have not sought to ratify Lorraine Daston's thesis, but to suggest its relevance to Harding's project. If Daston is wrong, this does not necessarily mean that objectivity did emerge full-grown and fully armed from the head of Descartes in 1637 or 1644. It does mean that Harding's work still awaits an analysis of the historical evolution of the concept of objectivity. More impor- tant, it awaits a historical analysis which locates the origin of the dominant notion of objectivity in moral philosophy. I would argue, at least, that the potential utility and explanatory power of Daston's thesis command serious attention.35 If she is right, then aperspectival objectivity is not intrinsic to Western science; that is, science is imaginable without it. Because her work represents such a rich potential resource for Harding's project, further work now remains to be done. If her thesis withstands scrutiny by historians, then the way is open for it, perhaps in revised form, to inform and extend the work on Sandra Harding's strong objectivity argument. Georgio de Santillana remarked that "what Galileo needed was a Newton" (1978, 24). In a sense, what Harding needs is a Daston. Whereas Galileo was unlucky, the opportu- nity exists to support and enrich Harding's theory in light of Daston's insights. Because by now it will be clear to all that Sandra Harding is the Cat in Wonderland, I propose to give her the last word: Yes, Alice, you can have knowledge that is fully socially situated. You must, or there is no hope of objectivity.36 168</page><page sequence="15">Jennifer Tannoch-Bland APPENDIX OBJECTIVITY TIMELINE Including Influences on Meanings Over Past and Future Time SCIENCE MORAL PHILOSOPHY Classical - Medieval Ontological objectivity (metaphysical meaning) Seventeenth century Plausibility criterion Descartes Degrees of certainty The mental as site of objectivity Bacon Communicability ideal Eighteenth century The moral scientist Hume Adam Smith Kant Objective as shared object, shared reason, shared information Nineteenth century Aperspectival Objectivity Mechanical Objectivity Late twentieth century Haraway S.

Though addressing ought questions, Bacon was seeking to describe, as well as prescribe, scientific practice. Kant strictly belongs under moral philosophy; his placement here merely allows the ideals and ideas that constituted aperspectival objectivity to stand out. NOTES I am indebted to the editorial readers of this journal and to Dieter Freundlieb for their many helpful suggestions and criticisms of earlier drafts of this article. 1. The epigram above is mine; it is inspired by the Australian philosopher Moira Gatens. In a paper entitled "Feminism, Philosophy, and Riddles Without Answers," she argues that women in philosophy cannot choose to create theory independently of the Western philosophical tradition, and quotes the cat who tells Alice in Wonderland she is mad: "You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here"' (Gatens 1991, 181). 2. Feminist empiricism has always argued that androcentric bias is correctable by a stricter adherence to the value-neutral methodological norms of science (S. Harding 1986). Where feminist standpoint theory has argued that scientific method is flawed by a blind faith in objectivity (Addelson 1983, 12), it is arguing for an expanded under- standing of what is meant by the terms rationalism and objectivity (Code 1991; Haraway 1991; S. Harding 1986; Longino 1990; Ring 1987; Sells 1993). 3. The three main feminist approaches to epistemology-identified and labeled by Sandra Harding (1986) as feminist empiricism, feminist standpoint theory, and feminist postmodernism-draw, respectively, on empiricism, Marxism, and postmodernism. They seek to demystify all aspects of knowledge through criticizing the sexism and phallocentrism of traditional epistemology. Where sexism is about discrimination against women, phallocentrism is about the male perspective being falsely universalized through "systems of representation ... which collapse the two sexes into the singular 'universal' model, which is congruous only with the masculine" (Grosz 1987, 476). 4. In answer to the charge that feminist epistemologies are really only sociologies of knowledge, Harding points out that all epistemologies make assumptions about how beliefs have been generated and have gained legitimacy, and that every sociology or psychology or history must assume an epistemology, because it must assume that its practices do produce knowledge (Harding 1991, 169-70). Stanley and Wise see "aca- demic feminism as a particular kind of 'epistemic community' " to which an "ethic of accountability is central" (1993, 13, 223). 5. Whereas scientific axiologies and moral axiologies (theories or doctrines of values) are traditionally treated as separate areas (Laudan 1984, 138-39), the feminist successor science project represents an attempt to link the two. In fact, it insists that moral and political beliefs have directed and must direct the development of scientific axiologies (S. Harding 1986, 250). On the one hand, this involves moving from an ought to an is; on the other hand, it claims continuity insofar as the feminist critique of science is "business as usual" in philosophy (Longino 1989, 50). Thus it still, in a sense, claims an is as the starting point. 170</page><page sequence="17">Jennifer Tannoch-Bland 6. The justice of this charge demands investigation. Whereas Susan Bordo's (1987) account of objectivity is more subtle than Daston implies, such investigation lies outside the scope of this paper. Similarly, Daston's generalization of conventional histories may not be justified. Whereas Descartes marks the beginning of real epistemology and of the philosophy of the subject, it is not altogether clear that-in "conventional histories"- he marks the beginning of objectivity. 7. Kant called all knowledge transcendental that is occupied not so much with objects as with our mode of cognition of objects, so far as this is possible a priori (Kant [1781] 1991). 8. Daston acknowledges that there exists a distinguished philosophical literature that attributes a form of aperspectival objectivity to Descartes, and she cites several works. But she believes they are the result of mistakenly collapsing the entire history of objectivity into a single moment, thus projecting current meanings and metaphors onto past usage. She remarks that Descartes's epistemological worries concern the entire human species, not individuals, and that (in contrast to, say, Montaigne's discussions of morals and manners) the perspectival metaphor is rarely invoked (Daston 1992, 616). 9. "New instruments and new methods of data analysis were a precondition for amalgamating measurements made by far-flung observers; international commissions met and wrangled over the standards and definitions that would make the result of, say, statistical or electrical research comparable; scientific labor had to be divided and disciplined to equalize differences of skill and training. The very phenomena had to be pruned and filtered, for some were too variable or capricious to travel well" (Daston 1992, 608-9). 10. In the Republic of Letters, "the real communicative bonds were friendships (or enmities) between individual scientists, nourished by lifelong correspondences, .. . [which] often waxed from cordial to intimate, with personal revelations strewn among scientific findings.... For all the cozy Gemeinschaft associations of the [later] 'scientific community,' the actual relationships that welded it together were increasingly narrow and formal" (Daston 1992, 608). 11. There is a tension in that the idea of this necessarily communal form of truth seeking finds resonances in much of the feminist work on epistemology when we consider that at the same time they are challenging the prevailing notion of objectivity (Nelson 1993; Harding 1993, 65). 12. Whereas Conway insists that Harding fails to take the "postmodem turn," his characterization of her standpoint epistemology wrongly imputes to her marginalized perspective "an epistemically pure glimpse of the real world" (1993, 122). Pauline Rosenau, in contrasting modem and postmodem science, claims that postmodernists treat emotions and values as central to inquiry. The goal of affirmative postmodernists is a science in which truth and virtue would not be kept apart, as they are in modern science (Rosenau 1992, 62-63). This is Harding's postmoderist terrain. 13. Where Ruddick, in critiquing Harding, insists "there is no one starting place for feminist epistemologies" (1993, 148), Harding makes it clear that marginalized lives and experiences provide "only a necessary-not a sufficient-starting point for maxi- mizing objectivity" (Harding 1993, 56-57). 14. This goes beyond Hartsock's explanation that it is "the critical reflection on gendered life experiences [and] not those different experiences in themselves" that makes the standpoint (1983, 289). Harding's model is not confined to self-reflexive feminist women, nor to reflection on our own experiences. 171</page><page sequence="18">Hypatia 15. In fact, the logic of standpoint theory leads to the refusal to essentialize its subjects of knowledge (Harding 1993, 66). 16. She points out that Hegel, Marx, Engels, and Lukacs all started their thinking from marginalized lives that were not their own (Harding 1993, 59). But it is in insisting that multiple lives provide only questions and not answers that her standpoint is postmoder (McCaughey 1993, 81). 17. Phyllis Rooney notes that "central to pragmatist and many feminist epistemo- logical projects is the important insight that knowers and the known come into being as such only through states, acts, and practices of knowing" (Rooney 1993, 21). So there is a sense in which Harding's radical stance has a history. 18. At the end of the twentieth century, the institution of science itself is under attack; its core beliefs are being questioned (see Bernstein 1983; Chalmers 1990; Currie 1993; Komesaroff 1986; Laudan 1984; Searle 1993). Though not alone, feminist standpoint, in its attempt to reinvent science and objectivity, has generated a consid- erable body of work on the problem of value-free objectivity. 19. But there is another, more subtle sense in which the ought becomes an is. For example, feminist histories abound in instances where, in the dominant account, men were assumed by law to be benevolent protectors of women; the family was deemed to be a safe place for its members; liberal democracies were seen as environments of equal opportunity. 20. As Haraway observes, "We would like to think our appeals to real worlds are more than a desperate lurch away from cynicism and an act of faith like any other cult's" (1991, 185). 21. Part of the feminist political project is to seek out and expose previously hidden facts, events, undercurrents, tendencies, nuances, relationships, ways of seeing, oppres- sions, inequalities, injustices, suppositions, inferences, prejudices, systems. Implicit in this project is a notion that the picture of the world thus gained will be a truer picture, less distorted, and therefore more "objective," in Harding's sense. 22. Daston does not address the feminist contention that to state one's political position is ethical, but she notes that "in much of the recent philosophical literature" the very absence of aperspectival objectivity has been thought to be the hallmark of ethics (Daston 1992, 599). Thus she notes the historical and ongoing ethical dimension of work on objectivity. 23. While philosophy of science was not at the time institutionalized, this is not to say it was not practiced. Insofar as they produced metascientific texts, we might legitimately call Sir Francis Bacon, Dugald Stewart, and William Whewell philosophers of science. 24. I am not claiming that Harding would necessarily accept Daston's notion of communicability, which involves an averaging of viewpoints. I argue simply that Harding would embrace an ideal of communicability. Donna Haraway articulates feminism's need for a communicability ideal in Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: "Femi- nists don't need a doctrine of objectivity that promises transcendence . . . We don't want a theory of innocent powers to represent the world ... we do need ... the ability partially to translate knowledges among very different-and power-differentiated- communities" (Haraway 1991,187). 25. Bacon saw the communicability of scientific knowledge among scientists as one of the benefits of his new methodology (Daston 1994, 46). In Salomon's House this communicability among men of all professions was intrinsic to the great project of amelioration of humanity's lot. The communicability ideal was extended to the general 172</page><page sequence="19">Jennifer Tannoch-Bland public, and Rene Dubos argues that at the end of the seventeenth century and throughout the eighteenth century leading scientists in France, Germany, and London were actively engaged in the project to share theoretical science with the general public (Dubos 1961, 153). In 1801 the chemist Humphrey Davey was giving public lectures in which he shared not only what was known to scientists but also his speculations and work in progress (Knight 1967, 10). And Kepler cited Galileo's willingness to make his knowledge public as partial proof of the objective truth of Galileo's knowledge claims (Dear 1992, 626). 26. Whereas it might be argued that the migration of aperspectival objectivity occurred in the opposite direction, that is, from science to moral philosophy, I suggest that dividing aperspectival objectivity into its constituent parts, the disinterestedness ideal and the communicability ideal, weakens that argument. Daston points out that Adam Smith's virtuous ideal of disinterestedness, although it attached to individual scientists, was absent from the practice of science until the mid-nineteenth century (Daston 1992, 605). 27. Because Galileo was a "gentleman" and an esteemed scholar, Kepler granted him plausibility. So Kepler employed what Dear calls a "criterion of trustworthiness" to determine the objective truth of Galileo's knowledge claims (Dear 1992, 619, 626). Ironically, Galileo himself, in denying instrumentalism, was actively insisting on what amounted to a noninstitutionalized version of ontological objectivity. He was led by what Popper calls the "truth is manifest" idea (1969, 5). This is not to deny the then-prevailing notions about men of science and the criteria by which their knowledge claims were judged. Daston argues that "trust was extended almost carte blanche to at least a small circle of respected colleagues and informants" in seventeenth-century science (Daston 1994, 49). It might be objected that, rather than a "criteria of trustworthiness" operating to determine objective truth, trustworthiness itself may have been calculated according to a "criterion of disinterestedness" that already existed in the sciences. Daston argues that while there was an "image of the disinterested scientist" before the mid-nineteenth century, it was based on the belief of the certainty of scientific arguments. It was not a criterion (1992, 606). 28. This is my term; I use it insofar as "partiality and not universality is the condition of being heard to make rational knowledge claims" (Haraway 1991, 195). In contrast, Dorrinda Outram asserts the danger and poverty of feminism's denial of and attack on universalist value systems, and still thinks that there might be a way of separating bias in practice from universalist value systems (1991, 367). 29. Laudan claims that objectivity is not the point. Science is not about objectivity of any description; it is about the utility or heuristic value of theories (Laudan 1990, 142-54). This is not to deny our expectations of objectivity. 30. This position is in conflict with Karl Popper's assertion of "knowledge without a knowing subject" (1979, 109). It asserts that knowledge necessarily presupposes a knower. 31. For the opposing argument that ontology is logically prior to epistemology, see Overend 1983, 74. Van Fraassen provides an interesting turn on the question. He asserts that, while we all have a notion of ontological objectivity, this is quite separate from our epistemic commitment (aren't we all scientific, and realists, nowadays?). In that scientific activity is about the construction rather than the discovery of truth, science is not necessarily connected to ontological objectivity (Van Fraassen 1980, 5,82). Instead of debating the naturalistic fallacy, he is claiming that science is not about the 173</page><page sequence="20">Hypatia ises. This fails to address objectivity as an ideal or composite of ideals, or our expecta- tions of objectivity. 32. At the same time, this requirement reflects the feminist suspicion that ethical and political imperatives are always already involved in epistemological imperatives (Tullock 1993, 1, 13). And Daston's work, in asserting moral and political impetus in the construction of aperspectival objectivity, lends historical support to the feminist contention. 33. This gives an account of the moralization of objectivity in this period as reflected in scientific image-making in atlases. It is about mechanical objectivity, and it addresses the asceticism of scientists' reproaching themselves for anthropomorphism and interpretation. 34. Daston and Galison have a book forthcoming, extending their work on the history of objectivity. 35. As discussed, the theory explains why there is a difference between eighteenth- century and twentieth-century conceptions of the scientist and objectivity. It also explains the difficulty in defining objectivity, the confusion that characterizes many accounts of objective knowledge, and the lack of consensus on what counts as objective knowledge. If objectivity has three distinct meanings, which share a complicated history, and only one of them has come to predominate; if different aspects of objectivity have had different import at different times; if it is not monolithic and immutable; then a great deal of the debate about objectivity has occurred without the benefit of correct premises concerning the nature of objectivity and what is at stake. 36. This pseudoquote is a bastardization of the concluding paragraph of Harding's essay: "Can the new social movements 'have it both ways'? Can they have knowledge that is fully socially situated? We can conclude by putting the question another way: if they cannot, what hope is there for anyone else to maximize the objectivity of their beliefs?" (Harding 1993, 74). Wonderland is no longer confined to feminist post- modernism, but has expanded its borders to encompass the whole of feminist epistemol- ogy.
