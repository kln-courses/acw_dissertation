<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE STATISTICAL VIEW OF NATURE* BY MORRIS R. COHEN College of the City of New York IT IS VERY gratifying for one who is neither a statistician nor a physicist to be asked to speak to you on statistical concepts and the physical world. I take it that you have chosen this topic because you feel that recent changes in the fundamental ideas of physics and especially Heisenberg's Indeterminacy Principle have some bearing on your work, and that you have invited a philosopher rather than a physicist or a statistician because you wish to consider not technical details but how the whole enterprise appears to one who stands out- side of both physics and statistics and tries to observe the main cur- rents in both. I shall therefore limit myself to a consideration of elementary ideas, in the belief that the rudiments need, and can stand, eternal repetition. Since the beginning of modern statistical science, its leaders such as Quetelet have in agreement with the pioneers of the other social sci- ences insisted that progress is possible only if we introduce the rigorous and deterministic methods which have brought such great success to the physical sciences. And now we are witnessing physical science itself not only raising doubt as to the adequacy of Newtonian mechanics and the law of the conservation of energy, but also challenging the entire classical conception of physical causation. This has caused con- siderable disturbance in the social sciences; but certain philosophers, both positivists and those of theologic leaning, are rejoicing. For the latter have been asserting for some time that our knowledge of physics is statistical only, of the same kind as our knowledge of social phe- nomena when these are the result of large numbers. To discuss the elements of this issue, I shall begin by considering the characteristics of statistical knowledge, and then try to analyze the nature of statistical mechanics and the significance of determinism in a statistical view of the world. I shall conclude with venturing some application as to the limitations of statistical measurement. Before doing so, it is interesting to note how many fundamental terms which the social sciences are trying to adopt from physics have as a matter of historical fact originated in the social field. Take, for instance, the notion of cause. The Greek aitia or the Latin causa was originally a * A paper read before the Ninety-seventh Annual Meeting of the American Statistical Association, New York City, December 28, 1935. 327</page><page sequence="2">328 AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATIONS purely legal term. It was taken over into physics, developed there, and in the 18th century brought back as a foreign-born king for the adoration of the social sciences. The same is true of the concept of law of nature. Originally a strictly anthropomorphic conception, it was gradually depersonalized or dehumanized in the natural sciences and then taken over by the social sciences in an effort to eliminate final causes or purposes from the study of human affairs. It is therefore not anomalous to find similar transformations in the history of such funda- mental concepts of statistics as average and probability. The concept of average was developed in the Rhodian laws as to the distributionof losses in maritime risks. After astronomers began to use it in correcting their observations, it spread to other physical sciences; and the prestige which it thus acquired has given it vogue in the social field. The term probability, as its etymology indicates, originates in practical and legal considerations of probing and proving. And now we are trying to fit social phenomenainto the patternsof probability worked out by mathe- matical physicists such as LaPlace and Poisson, and by mathematicians like Gauss and Karl Pearson. What are the essential traits that differentiate statistical from other kinds of knowledge? It is usual to discriminate it from history on one hand and from mechanics on the other.1 These distinctions are worth noting. Historical knowledge is concerned with individual objects or events, with individual persons, nations, or institutions having a definite date or position in time. Statistical knowledge differs in this respect by being concerned with numerical relations in multitudes which are fungible, i.e. in which individual differences are ignored. To know that the population of the United States in 1800 was 4,000,000 is, to be sure, historical in so far as it describes the United States at that time and indicates its power relative to other nations, but it is statistical in respect to the individuals who constitute that population. It gives us no information about any one of them. And this ignorance is not cured by averaging. If I am told that the average family then consisted of 5.6 persons, I do not thereby learn anything about any actual family. We are not thus denying that statistical information is a necessary aid in the understanding of history. To determine what was the popula- tion of Athens in 430 B.C. or of the United States in 1790 is surely a most significant task of history; but we do not thereby attain direct 1 The reader will note that the text distinguishes between different kinds of knowledge. The scientific statistician, of course, must use all the kinds of knowledge he can obtain, including pure mathematics which is certainly not in itself statistical.</page><page sequence="3">* STATISTICAL VIEW oF NATURE 329 information about any individual citizen, what were the peculiar traits that made some of them, like Pericles or Washington, such outstanding figures. This distinction between the historical and the statistical is also valid in the realm of physics. If I know that there was an earth- quake or an eclipse of the moon or that a column of mercury attained a certain height on a given occasion, my knowledge is so far purely historical. And from a logical point of view our knowledge of the geo- logic changes which our earth has undergone is of the same logical pattern as our knowledge of the changes in the dynasties which have ruled Egypt. In both cases we reconstruct individual past events on the basis of observations of presently existing records or remains. On the other hand, our knowledge of physical nature is strictly statistical whenever it is concerned with averages such as heights or weights of groups of objects or with the relative frequencies with which certain phenomena occur. The distinction between statistical and mechanical knowledge de- serves even greater attention. The classical view held generally throughout the 18th and 19th centuries regarded the principles of Newtonian mechanics, like those of Euclidean geometry, as self-evident or in some way necessary. Thus, philosophers like Kant, Whewell, and Wundt have tried to derive the Newtonian laws of mechanics from en- tirely a priori considerations. Also, great physicists like J. J. Thomson, the successor of Maxwell, explicitly declared the laws of dynamics to be in some sense superior to those which like the second law of thermo- dynamics, are merely based on experience. But the general distrust of self-evident principles that has come with non-Euclidean geometry and the recent development of non-Newtonian mechanics makes this position a difficult one to maintain. All the ultimate laws of nature which we know are contingent, that is, we know of no reason why these laws should prevail in fact rather than others which are con- ceivable; and the really decisive evidence for the truth of the laws of any mechanical system is that their consequences are verifiable, that is, agree with experimental observations. Yet though mechanical laws of the classical type are not justified by their self-evidence and are not independent of experience, they can be clearly distinguished from statistical laws by the fact that they assert universal or invariant con- nections in nature. Whenever we have two particles, they attract each other with a force that varies inversely as the square of the distance between them; or, whenever a body moves freely under the influence of a constant force, the velocity acquired will be proportional to the time during which the force acts. A single exception can thus logically refute the law. Now, statistical laws or correlations do not take such</page><page sequence="4">330 AMERICAN STATISTICAL AssoCIATION* universal form, but assert rather certain frequencies, for example, that a little over 51 per cent of all births are male. This, however, does not enable us to predict individual instances. To say that 75 per cent of the Romans were tall, e.g., above 5' 5", gives us no warrant for inferring that Cato was tall. And to say that this information makes it probable that Cato was tall does not really determine the individual case, for he may well have been only 5' 4" despite the fact that so many of his fellow-countrymen were taller. This makes a tremendous difference in the problem of verification. A universal proposition asserts something to be impossible and if that which is thus excluded does take place our proposition is definitely refuted. It is thus always conceivable and sometimes actually the case that a single crucial experiment can refute an hypothesis or supposed law. And if another hypothesis is thus con- firmed, the latter may be said to be verified in the sense that it has been shown to be in greater harmony with experimental observation than its rival or competing hypothesis. Thus, if the classical theory pre- dicts an observable motion relative to the aether, and such motion does not show itself under proper conditions of observation in the Michel- son-Morley experiment, we have definite evidence against the classical theory. And if the Einstein theory of relativity can explain this experi- ment as well as all that the classical theory does, we have definite reasons for preferring it. Statistical generalizations, however, cannot be so readily verified by any crucial experiment. Consider for instance, the well established statistical observation that as the number of voters increases, the pluralities in favor of some candidate increase also. According to this view, there is a negligible probability that the millions of voters of New York State will in the next election be exactly evenly divided between the Democratic and Republican candidates for Governor. If, however, that should actually happen, it will not refute our statistical generalization since the latter does not declare a tie vote under these conditions to be impossible. It may well be objected that this sharp distinction between mechan- ical and statistical laws in regard to verification, overlooks the fact that statistical laws apply not to individual instances but only to large groups or over a long run, and that when so taken they are verifiable. Thus, consider the classical statistical law referred to before as to the ratio of male to female births. If, for a long period and over a wide area this ratio is not found to prevail, we should surely regard it as refuted by experience, and some other ratio might be verified. This objection, however, while perfectly true does not fully obviate the difficulty to which we have pointed. For the test as to when a run is sufficiently long to verify a statistical law cannot in the nature of the</page><page sequence="5">* STATISTICAL VIEW OF NATURE 331 case be very precise. A few repetitions of the Michelson-Morley ex- periment are necessary to make certain that we have not over- looked something. But they are repetitions of what is essentially the same experiment which if true is sufficient to overthrow the contra- dictory universal. But no one can well determine just how many reports of different cities for different years would be necessary to refute the statistical law referred to above. I do not wish to ignore difficulties in pressing the foregoing point. The history of science undoubtedly shows that crucial experiments are very infrequent, and that they do not play the absolutely decisive role which popular histories of science ascribe to them. No single experi- ment overthrew the Ptolemaic astronomy. Galileo's supposed refuta- tion of Aristotle's theory of gravitation by throwing two objects from the tower of Pisa is rather mythical, for it does not seem that under the actual conditions of height and atmospheric friction and the means of observation, this experiment could have been decisive. Despite Lavoisier's experiments, the phlogiston theory continued to be held for a long time. Nevertheless, the issues in each of these cases were defi- nitely formulated because universal laws were involved and single facts, such as the observed phases of the planet Venus or the increased weight of certain substances after being burned, were definitely and directly contrary to the predictions. If a single fact is not generally sufficient to overthrow completely a supposed universal law which it contradicts, it is because an established hypothesis generally rests not on a single chain of arguments but on many interwoven threads, so that the cutting of one of these threads is not at once fatal. Moreover, theories are flexible and can be reformulated, or have auxiliary hy- potheses added, e.g., Lavoisier's experiments can be explained by en- dowing phlogiston with negative weight. But in any case every single theoretic statement in regard to nature takes the form of universal propositions which can be definitely refuted by a single contradictory instance and this is not true of statistical statements. Another way of stating the distinction between mechanical and statistical laws is that the former state causal relations while the latter are mere correlations. It is not necessary to go into the traditional dis- cussions as to the nature of causality. It is sufficient for our present purpose to insist that a causal relation means some intimate connection or thread of identity between two things, traits or events thus con- nected, while a statistical correlation may mean nothing more than a temporary coincidence. The fallacious assumption that a high correla- tion must necessarily represent a causal relation, while not held by sci- entific statisticians, is still widely current. In a book of mine published</page><page sequence="6">332 AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION* a few years ago, I referred to Dr. George Marshall who found a correla- tion of 87 per cent between the membership of the International (really American) Machinists' Union and the death rate of the state of Hyderabad. Many of my readers have since protested vigorously that such a high correlation extending over twelve years cannot be acci- dental or devoid of real significance. But the fact is that the correlation does not hold beyond the period taken. Indeed, it obviously could not have prevailed before the Machinists' Union was formed when there was still a considerable death rate in that Hindu State. If more in- stances of this sort are not available it is because most of us have no interest in such purely logical demonstrations. We look for correlations where we suspect a real connection and then we regard whatever small correlation we find as a proof of our hypothesis. Where there are genuine causal connections we should expect statistical correlation, but the converse is not necessarily true. Genuine physical and mechan- ical laws are thus more than statistical correlations. The law of the conservation of energy and Newton's law of motion, are all empirical in the sense that they depend for their verification on observation, but they also indicate some element of identity in cause and effect, or ante- cedent and consequent, and that is more than mere statistical correla- tion. The observation that a certain correlation prevails for a certain period does not of itself give us reason for supposing that it prevailed before we observed it or that it will do so in the future. But scientific procedure in physics cannot go on without assuming that the relations we deal with prevailed before we discovered them and are independent of our knowing them. Careful statisticians recognize this when they draw a distinction between gross and refined statistics, between birth rates where the denominator is the total population and those based on the number of married women of child-bearing age. Such distinc- tions are based on the recognition that causal relations are necessary to give statistical correlations real significance. The foregoing reflections suggest one of the reasons why there is in fact much less consensus in regard to social than physical laws as statements of invariant or causal relations. If we formulate a theory of business cycles or of the variations of the stock market, and the actual facts do not conform, we do not generally abandon the theory, but we explain the departure of the facts by means of disturbing factors that prevent a fair test of our assumed law. Now, the existence of perturbations is also found in physics. But in the latter the effect of disturbing forces can generally be measured independently. That, however, is generally impossible when as in the case of the weather or of biologic and social phenomena generally, we have a large number</page><page sequence="7">* STATISTICAL VIEW OF NATURE 333 of factors that are not independent of each other. Hence, in dealing with such complex phenomena we can seldom prove that if a given disturbing factor were absent, our assumed law would operate. To at- tain invariant relations we must be able to isolate our factors or vary one at a time. Otherwise, we have too many variables and no assump- tion of ours can be definitely verified. The analysis of any situation into its related factors is therefore the condition for any definite test as to the truth of even statistical generalizations. It is important to remember that we do not always get nearer to the truth by increasing the number of cases on which our generalization is based. Observations on fifty Chinese laundrymen no more justify the generalization as to Chinese in general than an observation of twenty Chinese, if they all come from Canton, all belong to the same society, etc. It is only when by good fortune the randomness of our samples does eliminate the fallacy of selection that a larger number gives better evidence than a smaller number. In the end, the truth of a generaliza- tion from a sample depends on the homogeneity of the group with respect to which we wish to generalize. A single experiment on a new substance, to test whether it is acid or alkaline, is much more convinc- ing than the result of a questionnaire addressed to millions of army men to measure their intelligence. For the latter is not a simple quality of a uniformly repeatable pattern. In this respect, the methods of social statistics are gross compared with the refinements of analysis, so that when our analysis is thoroughgoing, as it generally is in physics, one or two samples are as good as million. If what we are meas- uring is really homogeneous, one instance is sufficient. In the social field, therefore, too, statistics cannot take the place of analysis; and in fact acute social analysts have contributed much more to our under- standing of social phenomena than those who, without genius or vision, have believed that the mere collection of instances will give us adequate knowledge. Statistical method has been closely associated with the belief in what is loosely called induction, and it is often asserted that the founders of statistical science were men who, like Sir William Petty and those who organized the Royal Society, were influenced by Francis Bacon. It would take me far afield to show the mythical character of this history. A few observations, however, are essential. There can be no doubt that statistics deals with actuality, and that knowledge of actualities is always empirical, i.e., that we cannot obtain knowledge of existence by purely a priori methods. There is, however, no genu- ine progress in scientific insight through the Baconian method of accumulating empirical facts without hypotheses or anticipation of</page><page sequence="8">334 AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION- nature. Without some guiding idea we do not know what facts to gather. Without something to prove, we cannot determine what is relevant and what is irrelevant. If we wish to find the laws of the weather, the thousands of millions of observations will not of them- selves indicate the true causes of laws. Only when we strike some fruit- ful idea or hypothesis such as the late Carl Barus did in determining the influence of dust on the concentration of moisture, can we make some progress in the understanding of nature. Economic statistics, charts of the variations of prices, incomes, imports and exports, etc., do not constitute science unless organized, controlled and informed by some general idea. A collection of data will not give us science any more than a collection of ores will give us metal works. We need fire to fuse our material into some pattern. In science we achieve that, if we discover the proper perspective from which the order of phenomena becomes visible to the trained eye. This does not mean that we do not often go wrong because of false hypotheses, but it is well to recall the caution of a great naturalist, viz., Charles Darwin, who rightly maintained that the danger of false hypotheses is never as great as that of a false observation. For even a false hypothesis may enable us to advance the organization of our material; but everything that is based on a false observation has to be undone before we can build anew on more reliable data. But note that even in statistical work we do not dispense with a priori assumptions, that is, with assumptions which are based on general considerations and which cannot be readily refuted by empirical considerations. We can see this in our various assump- tions as to what are independent or equiprobable events. I do not wish to touch on the subject of probability which will be more adequately treated by Dr. Nagel. But I must call attention to the fact that in all statistical measurement and inference we do involve ourselves in assumption as to what events are equally probable and what events are independent. And in this field priori considerations are most potent. Ask people at large, what is the probability of a penny falling head? Almost everybody answers one-half, although few have ever taken an actual count of the relative frequency with which pennies fall head or tail. The answer comes in fact not on the basis of actual observation, but on the indetermination which prevents us from giving heads a preference over tails. If, however, we ask whether Americans are as likely to pay their bills as Germans, we do not ask for data, nor are we likely to say that one is as likely as the other. The answer will largely depend on where we live. Our belief, then, in the probability of an event is largely determined by considerations other than sta- tistical study. And this, curiously enough, has misled many trained</page><page sequence="9">* STATISTICAL VIEW OF NATURE 335 scientists. Thus the astronomer Proctor insists that if a penny has been thrown up fifty times and has fallen head forty times, the prob- ability of the next throw being head is still one-half. Those who say this, however, are confusing mathematical reasoning (to wit: what follows if we make a certain assumption) with an existential assertion. If the probability of a penny falling head as often as tail were built on experience alone, any long run of tails or of heads ought to throw doubt on our assumption of independence and equiprobability. It is absurd to suppose what is established on the basis of past observation cannot be upset or modified by increased observation. We must, therefore, reject the tradition of which Quetelet and Buckle were the high priests, and which spoke of statistical averages as if they were iron and unchangeable laws of nature beyond human control. (People still speak of the average or the mean about which our numbers oscillate as the normal man with some implication perhaps that the normal is the perfect.) Obviously there is no law of nature which compels the normal family to have 2.7 children or the normal man to divorce his wife or commit bankruptcy once in so many years. There is, therefore, also no merit in the argument that the existence of such averages proves that human volition cannot change what these averages describe. Statistical averages do give us knowledge of groups if there are in fact laws which keep the distribution in those groups approximately stable. But that empirical generalizations do not always give us genuine laws can be seen in popular generalizations about diet, exercise, the evil eye, lucky and unlucky numbers, the length of cycles on the stock market, etc. Are such generalizations more reliable if expressed in numbers, charts or curves? As a matter of fact we know of no statistical laws comparable in constancy with the law of multiple proportion in chemistry or of planetary motion in astronomy. All the social statistical averages that we know vary somewhat, as Lexis and others have shown, from year to year and are conditioned by our social and political regulations. Many of them, e.g., the number of bank failures per annum, car loadings or automobile accidents, have no meaning except under special conditions which come and pass, while mechanical laws are independent of ge- ography and chronology. For the very meaning of causality is that mere position in time or place cannot in itself determine a natural change. Suppose that in the social field you find a formula like Pareto's that fits the tables of incomes for several countries for a number of years. Does it follow that it is a law which will persist and which legislation cannot change? Some have actually argued to that effect, but in point</page><page sequence="10">336 AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION* of fact it is not true universally, and does not hold for small incomes.2 Statistical information needs refined analysis before it can lead to causal or rigorously scientific information. If we know that the average life of men is less than that of women we ask, is it due to occupation, habits, or to organic handicaps? We need to pass from the macroscopic to the microscopic point of view. It is necessary to insist on these obvious reflections because of the widespread manner of speaking of the law of large numbers and the normal frequency curve as if they were a priori laws of nature govern- ing the distribution of all possible phenomena. This popular view is logically groundless and vitiates much statistical work such as that involved in much of our intelligence testing. Let us remember that the curve of distribution derived from the Gaussian assumptions can hold true only where these assumptions happen to be true in fact. Now, the curve assumes that our phenomena or instances are symmetrically distributed, but this is obviously not true of all phenomena even if their number is indefinitely increased. Many anthropologic measurements certainly do not conform to it, e.g., the death rate, the acceleration and retardation of growth in children, and the like. In many cases to be sure, larger groups show greater stability and more balance or symmetry than the smaller groups which constitute them, but the reverse is also true at times. The normal probability curve is a help in analysis, but as a description of nature it is true only of those groups of figures which happen to con- form to it. There is no fair presumption that all groups will conform. II So far I have been considering the distinction between statistical laws or correlations on one hand and mechanical laws on the other. But we have with us the science of statistical mechanics. What light does it throw on our issue? Let us consider it in three stages: first, the classical form of statistical mechanics; second, the modification introduced by the quantum theory; and third, the more recent wave mechanics and the Indeterminacy Principle. The conception of a statistical knowledge of nature was first clearly enunciated by Maxwell (though partly anticipated by Calusius) in connection with the law of entropy. In his day it was assumed that all genuine physical laws must be deducible from Newtonian mechanics. But the irreversibility of certain physical changes, e.g., the diffusion of gases or the fact that heat is conducted only from hotter to colder 2 The difference between an empirical and a rational formula can be seen when we compare the carpenters' rule for constructing a right angle with the Pythagorean theorem. The carpenters' rule holds only for lengths of 3, 4, and 5, while the Pythagorean theorem gives us a whole system of geometric propositions or an infinite series of such possible numbers.</page><page sequence="11">* STATISTICAL VIEW OF NATURE 337 bodies, could not be deduced from mechanical principles concerning phenomena that are essentially reversible. This led Maxwell and Boltz- mann to the idea that this irreversibility is not a fundamental law of nature holding like the laws of Newtonian mechanics always and every- where from the largest mass to the smallest particle, but that it is a derivative result from the arrangement of molecular motions according to the curve of "error" or probability. From this point of view it is by no means impossible, though highly improbable, that some phe- nomena may actually take place contrary to the law of entropy. There have indeed been those who have urged that organic phenomena and even Brownianmovements illustrate this possibility. It should be noted, however, that this classical system of so-called statistical mechanics does not proceed from empirical observations, by averaging and estab- lishing correlations. Rather does it begin by assuming that there are definite laws which determine the distribution of molecular velocities in accordance with the Gaussian function originally derived to describe the distribution of errors of observation. This law of distribution is thus assumed to be an invariant law of nature, though it does not enable us to determine the position of any particular molecule. It is well to note also that statistical mechanics is still mechanics. It con- tinues to assume the Hamiltonian principle, and still proceeds from a theoretically assumed system of mechanical laws in the microscopic realm to explain observable macroscopic phenomena. No wonder, therefore, that Maxwell could talk of statistical mechanics and yet believe in the absolute uniformity of all molecules, fresh as they issued from the hand of the Creator. At the end of the 19th century, its leading physicist, the venerable Lord Kelvin, spoke of two clouds in the mechanical view of the uni- verse, its difficulties in explaining the Michelson-Morley experiment and the partition of energy in the spectrum. Both of these difficulties proved insurmountable and led to revolutionary changes. The first difficulty led to the non-Newtonian mechanics of Einstein's relativity theory. The second difficulty led to the perhaps more radical departure from classical mechanics, the quantum theory of Planck and Einstein. The classical theory regarded the Universe as made up ultimately of separate particles, and yet the radiation of energy was regarded as con- tinuous-a view which Einstein has well characterized as maintaining that the world is both soup and a bag of hard peas. Now, the actual distribution of energy in the spectrum cannot be fitted into the theory that energy radiation is continuous, and this seems to eliminate the continuity of the world which is the essence of the classical geometric view which goes back through Newton, Galileo and Kepler to the early</page><page sequence="12">338 AMERICAN STATISTICAL AssoCIATIONL Greek geometers. The world consists not only of individual particles but also of multitudes of quanta of energy. This strengthens the sta- tistical view so far as the latter proceeds by summation. The quantum theory, however, not only retains mechanical or invariant laws, such as are embodied in Hamilton's Principle, but adds new ones, to wit, exclusion principles such as Pauli's, which assert that certain states are impossible in nature. After a series of great achievements, the quantum theory began to encounter insurmountable difficulties and a seemingly more revolu- tionary form of mechanics-popularly known as wave mechanics- began to take possession of the field. From the popular viewpoint, the most impressive novelty of this mechanics is Heisenberg's Indeterminacy Principle, according to which all physical measurements are subject to an indetermination within one quantum. We have always known empirically that our measure- ments vary and that laws or universal propositions about the physical universe can never be absolutely verified in actual measurements. Heisenberg's Principle, however, goes farther and gives us a theoretic basis in the very nature of our mechanical laws for assigning a definite limit beyond which greater accuracy is unattainable. This in itself does not necessarily mean a denial of the principle of causality or an asser- tion of indeterminism in the objective physical world. It may be explained as a consequence of the fact that any measurement which in- volves observation of nature through light is itself a physical operation which disturbs the object observed. But be that as it may, the radical feature of the new mechanics is that its basic law or equation does not assert an invariant rule that determines the position and velocity of every individual particle, but asserts rather a probability function so that with regard to any electron or photon it can tell us only the relative frequency with which it will be found in a given position. Though called the wave mechanics, the new physics really abandons the effort at a precise picture or mechanical model of what goes on in the microscopic realm that forms the physical sub-stratum of the visible world. It thus seems to abandon at the outset the possibility of an absolutely accurate and exhaustive description of the world. The indeterminacy which it introduces into physics is the indeterminacy of passing from an average or a probability function to an individual instance. For a law which describes how a group of individuals are distributed does not give us precise knowledge of any individual con- stituent of the group. In this sense, the new mechanics is more con- scious of the old truth that our most accurate knowledge of the physical world is never free from an element of probability. While this involves</page><page sequence="13">* STATISTICAL VIEW OF NATUIRE 339 profound technical transformations in physical science it is not very revolutionary from the philosophic point of view. The new mechanics still operates with mathematical or invariant laws which relate one state of the physical system to past or future states. If any observ- able or macroscopic state of nature is determined, other states become determined. And that is after all the essence of the old mechanics. It was never necessary for physical science to assume that the classical mechanics completely exhausted the nature of things. The geometrical points and lines, the regular spheres, the perfectly rigid bodies of the classical mechanics were generally recognized as limiting concepts which represented, to be sure, features of the actual world but never exhaustive accounts. The new mechanics recognizes this limitation explicitly. It uses a wider conception of "coordinates" or the elements which determine a "state" of nature. Just as a number may be resolved in different ways as the products of two factors, or just as a force acting in any direction may be resolved into different pairs of com- ponents, so states of nature according to the new physics can be re- garded as resolvable into different "superposed" states without altering the physical consequences. The invariant relations of mechanics bind features of the visible macroscopic states together, and in that respect the classic tradition of mechanics still holds the field, even though we no longer hold the faith in very simple laws governing all things from the greatest to the smallest. III Our brief glimpse of statistical mechanics reinforces the point that while statistical knowledge is distinct from mechanics it depends upon the latter as well as on history. There is no doubt that we can some- times make progress in science by ignoring the question of mechanics and studying variations statistically. This has notably been the case with the Darwinian doctrine of natural selection. Neither Darwin nor Mendel went into the causes of variation. Still Mendel, trained as a physicist, made possible the great advance in genetics by seeking and finding an invariant rate. There is no reason to suppose that if varia- tions were completely lawless, the resultant of a large number of them would show any order or recognizable pattern. If any group shows conformity to the law of large numbers, it means that its individual variations are governed by certain forces which bring about symmetry, decreasing frequencies of larger variations, and all the other features which have to be assumed in order to justify a frequency curve. This brings us to the main issue. The statistician used to be taught to have faith in determinism.</page><page sequence="14">340 AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION* Shall he now follow popularizers of recent physics and regard it more scientific and up-to-date to profess indeterminism? It is tempting to say that he need take neither position, that all he needs to assume is that the universe has certain observable statistical regularities. What, how- ever, does the latter statement imply? Admitting for example, that we do not know the cause or causes which disintegrate any particular atom of uranium, and that all we do know are observable regularities in the behavior of the macroscopically visible masses, the fact remains that we cannot get along in science or in practice without expecting such regularities to recur. What ground have we for this expectation? The answer is that if we assume that our visible material is composed of an unimaginably large, but still calculable, number of invisible micro- scopic elements and that there are invariant laws according to which the happenings in this realm may be distributed and integrated, we have the most powerful means at our command for the discovery and understanding of an ever increasing number of physical phenomena. We may therefore regard our assumption as well established or verified as any other bit of reliable knowledge in our possession. If the most reliable social statistics, such as our mortality rates for different years, do not exhibit such measurable stability, it is not merely due to the smaller numbers in the latter field, but also to the fact that we here deal with more factors that are not isolable, so that the invariant rela- tions between them are not so readily ascertained. Hence more stable uniformities in the social realms are to be found not only by increasing the number of observations, but also by greater refinement of analysis. And this is exactly what a life insurance company does when instead of relying merely on an ever larger number of death records, it takes advantage of medical research as to the causes which prolong or shorten life. Its business would be even more secure if it could determine the true causes of war and rebellion as well as earthquakes and plagues. Without causal laws for the recurrence of phenomena, all our observa- tions would at best belong only to the field of history and not to natural science. We should put down in our books that these frequencies were observed at such and such times; but we shall have no reason for ex- pecting them to recur unless we believed such recurrence to be grounded in the nature of things. A world of which statistical knowledge is possible is then a world in which there are variations which are in part individually unforeseeable and unpredictable, and therefore, inexplicable, but in which certain laws or regularities prevail. And if some one were to maintain as Poincare once suggested, that the laws of nature are themselves chang- ing then we should look for the law according to which such change</page><page sequence="15">* STATISTICAL VIEW OF NATURE 341 takes place. A body changes its position according to some law which may be expressed as a constant velocity. So changes in velocity involve either a constant acceleration or one that changes according to some law of force. Ultimately all change involves some constancy. This is not an empirical observation merely, but a condition of significant dis- course. We cannot talk sense except on condition that our expressions have some definite meaning and there is no meaning without some element of constancy in the field of variation, wherever that is chosen. We may see the same truth in a more specifically statistical context. Traditional statistical procedure has always assumed that the varia- tions in our measurements of such magnitudes as the height of a mountain or the specific gravity of iron, are not variations of the object itself which is supposed to be.constant, but are rather due to changes in our manipulations of the instruments of measurement. Now, sup- pose one questions this assumption, as Charles Peirce did long before the rise of the Indeterminacy Principle in physics. That highly original American philosopher ventured to suggest that behind the variations which fall within the limits of the error of measurement there are still smaller variations of the object itself, so that absolute con- stancy is an ideal never attained in actuality. As a philosophic sugges- tion this is worthy of more attention than we can devote to it here. For our present purpose it is sufficient to note that so long as the variation can be expressed in some laws, we have sufficient determinism for a statistical universe. The recognition of the view that constancy and variation are polar categories, opposed but inseparable, each meaningless apart from the other, enables us to deal more clearly with the vexed problem as to chance and determinism, neither of which can be eliminated from a statistical view of nature. It is popular to say that chance merely expresses our ignorance. But this offers no basis for mathematical com- putation. Measurable chance is something that certainly does not de- pend on individual ignorance. When I ask today what chance is there of my dying on a Tuesday, there is to be sure an element of ignorance involved; but that is the ignorance which is necessarily involved in any system of finite knowledge. Nothing that anyone can find out by medical research or otherwise will be sufficient to determine completely or absolutely the individual event-not even the fact that I am con- demned by a court of law to be hanged on that day. But on the assump- tion that the day of the week makes no difference, that as many people die on Tuesdays as on any other day of the week, and that we have to die on one or other of these, the chance of its happening on a Tuesday is one-seventh. The ignorance involved here is not absolute. We do</page><page sequence="16">342 AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION- know something about the causes of death which enables us not only to be certain that death is coming, but that all pretensions that Tues- day is a lucky day or an unlucky one rest on insufficient evidence. If, on the other hand, it is a fact that people generally rest on Sunday or use their automobiles more, this may affect the relative death rates on the different days of the week. We may then say that a chance event dealt with in statistics is one for which we have determining principles that are necessary but insufficient. Pure chance is, indeed, incompre- hensible unless defined with reference to some rule determining all possible variations. Thus, if we speak of the chances of a certain die turning up a six in three successive throws, we assume a limited num- ber of possibilities all equally probable. If the chances were not regu- lated by some rule or order we should have no basis for any one result rather than any other. If there is any reason for any expectation, it is because there is some determination in the case, even though we do not know enough of what determines the individual event. Similarly, reflection on the abstract character of the repeatable pat- terns which are the subject of statistical as well as of mechanical laws, enables us to see that law is meaningless apart from all contingency or chance. It is a great mistake to believe that mechanical science involves a completely determined world, such as the Hegelian Absolute. On the contrary, if there are repeatable patterns or laws, there must be genuine plurality and this necessarily means relative independence or indifference. Thus, if everything depended on everything else, there would be no sense in saying that the photo-electric effect depends on the frequency of the impinging light, and not on other factors. Chance and determination are thus both objective logical consequences of the fact that any system with which science can deal must be defined and limited. Consider, for instance, the laws of celestial mechanics which make our solar system determinate. That some powerful body shall pass it so near as to cause it all to be smashed, would be an accident in the sense that from the coordinates of our system and the laws of celestial mechanics, the event cannot be determined. We can of course insist that if we knew the distance between our solar system and that body, and knew the rates at which they approach each other, we could predict the solar catastrophe. But this only means that we have to en- large our original system to explain an event which would be an acci- dent within the narrower domain. If, then, we distinguish between relativity and subjectivity, accidents are relative to the system and not to mere subjective opinions.3 3 Professor Ducasse's strictures (page 347) ignore this relativity. The determinism of an absolutely complete univerie is not an attainable,-certainly not a verifiable-factor in any natural science.</page><page sequence="17">* STATISTICAL VIEW OF NATURE 343 The question, however, may be raised, Are there any isolated sys- tems? Are not all things inter-connected? In reply, we must insist that any intelligible system with which science can deal must be defined by a limited number of laws and determination thus limited. If you look at the world geometrically, certain features are connected with other features in certain invariant relations. If a disk, for instance, is cir- cular or triangular, we compute its area according to certain invariant consequences of its geometric properties. That, however, which is necessary to determine an object geometrically will not be sufficient mechanically. So likewise, the masses and motion of a system may not determine all of its physical properties, and the latter may not be sufficient to specify the properties of an organism. Similarly, biologic factors alone may not be sufficient to determine how a man will vote or respond to a given argument. In general, sciences aim to attain the form of logical systems in which a limited number of laws determine all the processes and connections between the variables in the field. The propositions of any science thus form what a mathematician calls a group. To the extent that a number of propositions can be derived from a certain number of assumptions, they are so far independent of the truth or falsity of other propositions. The foregoing considerations do not deny that as science grows, we learn more about the determination of things. We can see this in the way science finds univocal relations to take the place of less deter- minate or one-to-many relations. Consider a case of what is called a plurality of causes. If I think of headaches as a single species, I may find the causes in eye-strain, in noxious smoke, in improper food, in the degeneration of certain tissues or other factor. This may be suffi- ciently determinate for practical purposes. However, for scientific pur- poses I may analyze the different kinds of headaches and find that the one due to eye-strain is different from the one due to alcoholic drink. Or again, I may find that in all these different forms of headaches, there is one common factor, let us say a certain pressure on certain nerve endings. In the end, however, the determinism aimed at in any science is abstract. While events in nature are individualized, and every moment is different from every other, mechanical science and statistics are concerned with the fungible aspects of things, with those features which repeat themselves indefinitely. William James some- where refers to an animal that is being experimented upon and referred to as a specimen, saying if it could, " Excuse me, it's me." We may stretch this and say that if the individual molecule could speak, it would say, "To be sure, I am a member of the noble species of hydrogen molecules, but I am altogether different from some of my degenerate neighbors." Physics may recognize different kinds of hydrogen atoms,</page><page sequence="18">344 AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION* just as vital statistics may distinguish between male and female deaths. It is to history and to intimate human relations that individual differ- ences are of the utmost importance. The individual is more than any of its phases, and there would be no determination if there were not something to be determined. If, therefore, there is such a thing as genuine individuality, if the world consists of a number of things which are genuinely distinct from each other, although they modify each other in certain abstract ways, then there is a genuine incommensur- ability between the individual and the universal. Each is an unattain- able limit to the other. No number of rules then can exhaustively determine the fullness of individual existence, though every change of abstract or isolated phase may be invariably connected with corre- sponding changes in other beings. Statistics and mechanics cannot therefore dispense with history. IV The foregoing reflections are not without bearing on the problem of measurement by statistical methods in the social sciences. In the first place, we ought not to overlook the obvious distinction between enumeration and measurement. We can enumerate a multi- tude, but the measurement of a continuous quantity or magnitude involves other operations. Thus we measure length by laying off a standard unit. We measure weight by a process of balancing, and of course the measurement of all derivative magnitudes involves more complicated processes. The full meaning of measurement in the physical sciences is seen when that which is measured is an extensive quantity to which the addition theorem is applicable. Those traits of nature which are not subject to these conditions are not, strictly speak- ing, measurable. Briefly, the modern analysis of measurement calls attention to the following conditions: (1) we must be able to identify a standard character or state capable of indefinite repetition, (2) we must define some operation to determine when two magnitudes are equal, and (3) we must define some operation which will give meaning to the sum of two or more magnitudes. It may be urged that in the measurement of intensive magnitudes, the last of these conditions is absent. The fact, however, is that in the measurement of physical in- tensities such as temperature and the like, we always try to connect that which is measured with extensive elements such as distances on a thermometer scale, and this is very difficult to achieve in the social realm. Even if we limit ourselves to intensive social magnitudes such as pleasures or preferences, we find that statistics do not give us very much information, for our human preferences are proverbially inconsistent or</page><page sequence="19">* STATISTICAL VIEW OF NATURE 345 highly variable in time according to incalculable subjective factors. We may put it in other terms by saying that in measuring human attitudes by questionnaires or records of preferences, we are dealing with the resultants of so many factors that the empirical results are seldom highly significant. For, as we saw before, where we do not isolate a single determinant we cannot expect to find a determinate relation. Somewhat similar warnings have been made in biology and in physics; and social phenomena are even more complicated because they include not only physical and biologic elements, but also such factors as fashion, linguistic attitudes and the like. It becomes evident, then, that mere accumulation of social statistics will not enable us to isolate the relevant factors and to determine constant relations any more than we have been able to do with meteorologic statistics. Where we deal with fungible goods as we do in the realm of economics, we ignore all but the factor defined, such as price, amount of supply, etc. But how strong a desire for economic gain will outweigh tabus against forbidden food, working on the Sabbath, making graven images, or doing something which is dishonorable or results in loss of caste, we are hardly in a position to tell by statistical methods alone. Certainly the questionnaire method with children in the movies or students in the class room, selected because they can be readily induced to take the trouble to answer, can hardly claim to be adequate measurement. There is little evidence that the replies of other people will be the same as that of our selected group, and there is no way in which we can be assured that we have not fallen into the fallacy of selection no matter how much care we have exercised to choose at random. There are always characteristics of our group which we do not have in mind or reject as irrelevant but which may in fact be the most important factors in determining the results-for instance, our particular neigh- borhood, social class, temporary fashion or response to some special condition of the experiment which we have no thought of as significant. Thus, some one examines a number of school children in a given city and compares the standing of Jews and non-Jews. But the Jews happen to be of a special neighborhood where the parents follow certain occu- pations or all come from Turkey or Saloniki, and are as different from Russian or German Jews as Turks are from Russians and Germans. Another confusion in the attempt to use statistics in social measure- ment is the failure to discriminate between a phenomenon and people's opinion about it. Suppose you wish to measure that illusive quality, intellectual eminence. A leading psychologist who is entitled to our profound respect because of his many achievements, tries to dispose of the issue by asking a number of specialists to make an estimate and</page><page sequence="20">346 AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION* then treating their answers statistically. But is not this measuring rather a group of opinions? The belief that the average of a number of judgments by experts is necessarily more correct than the judgment of any one of them is based on the assumption that all these judgments are independent. But is that assumption always true? Experts in a given field read the same books or periodicals and are subject to vogues or fashions. When a vote is taken as to who is the leading psychologist, ablest baseball player, most beautiful actress or most interesting novel, the results may be more indicative of something about the voters for the time being than about that which is voted. The whole scheme of intelligence-testing assumes something whose nature is very ill-defined. Indeed, some of the leaders in this field first took the trouble to prove that there is no such thing as general intel- ligence and then proceeded to devise methods for measuring it. We must have clear ideas as to what it is that we are measuring. There are other and subtler fallacies resulting from too great reliance on the technical procedures of statistical methods. Consider, for in- stance, some of the conclusions as to heredity by Galton and Karl Pearson. If we ignore the statistical methods and look at the matter critically, we can see that the extent of their material does not justify their conclusions. Surely a study of a thousand cases for two or three generations cannot determine the laws of inheritance, as to what traits are and what traits are not constant in environmental changes. I do not wish to deny that improved statistical methods enable us to guard against such errors. But it is elementary logic rather than technical statistics that enables us to realize this. I may in passing express the suspicion that biometric methods in genetics may by emphasizing unit characters, be doing violence to the fact that in an organism various elements are not completely independent, and that statistical methods based on the assumption of such independence lead us astray.

DIscussIoN 1. In Professor Cohen's paper occurs the statement that "accidents are relative to the system and not to our subjective opinions." This means that an accident in a given system is that which cannot be predicted in terms of the laws of that system and the state of the system at a given time. It seems to me, however, that "a given system" means only such a portion of the universe as we choose to consider; and that the fact that accidents do occur in a system we consider shows that, objectively, it is not properly called a system, but is only a part of the total system of the universe, and connected with its other parts. The accidentality of accidents is thus wholly relative to subjective selection by us of a part only of the universe. 2. ProfessorCohen objects to the statement that "chance merely expresses our ignorance" on the ground that, e.g., the chance of my dying on a Tuesday can be calculated, and ignorance is not a basis for calculation. Is it not the fact, however, that the word "chance" is currently used in two distinct, though related, ways? In the expression "the chance of my dy- ing on a Tuesday," chance means probability, and that probability is calcu- lated on the basis of what we now do know about the day of the week on which my death will occur, viz. that it is one out of only seven. In an expression such as: "whether so and so will occur is a matter of chance," a matter of chance means a matter unpredictable because we do not know what would be needed to predict it. Thus, the word chance is used sometimes to refer to the fact that we know enough to tell something (though not everything) that we should like to be able to tell about the occurrence of an event; and sometimes to refer to the fact that we do not know enough to tell anything that we should like to be able to tell about the occurrence of an event. 3. Professor Cohen stated that, with the growth of our knowledge, "events which are undetermined now, will become determined later." This seems to me to overlook the difference between determinism and predictability. Pre- dictability requires not only that events be determined, i.e., be according to some law, but in addition that we should (1) know what that law is, and (2) know what now is the state of the system within which that law holds. Growth of knowledge, thus, may render the now unpredictable later predic- table, but not the now undetermined later determined. C. J. DUCASSE Brown University</page></plain_text>
