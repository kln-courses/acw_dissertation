<plain_text><page sequence="1">[fi Guns, game and the grandee: THE CULTURAL POLITICS OF DEERSTALKING IN THE Scottish Highlands Hayden Lorimer This paper considers how the concentrated pattern of private landownership in the Scottish Highlands can be understood in relation to the field sport of deerstalking. Focusing on devel- opments during the interwar years, it demonstrates how a series of connected representa- tional practices, embodied rituals and political strategies were deployed by the sporting and landed community in defence of this elite leisure activity. These power-laden strategies coalesced into a distinctive culture of nature, which, although in part a continuation of ten- dencies set in train during the nineteenth century, also embraced new rhetorics of nation- hood, ecological thought and landscape preservation. The paper demonstrates how humans, animals, technologies, science, localized history and popular memory were all drawn into deerstalking's unequally weighted networks of association. Ultimately it asserts that the motif of custodianship and tradition commonly associated with modern sporting landownership in the Highlands was, and still is, used as an effective means to retain hegemonic control of the land resource. Finding task to which definitive such answers notable to land the reformers vexed question as Tom 'Who Johnston, owns John Scotland?' MacEwen, is a task to which such notable land reformers as Tom Johnston, John MacEwen, Andy Wightman and Robin Callander have devoted enormous effort.1 Their con- cerns have been founded on what is viewed as an outdated, unjust and secre- tive system of feudal landownership dominated by a small number of lairds and corporate interests. Equally problematic has been the maintenance of this land resource as a 'wilderness', primarily to facilitate its use for elite blood sports. The associated programmes of land management which ensure this artificial condition have been criticized on the grounds of economic efficiency, environ- mental unsustainability and the constraints imposed on public recreation. While such activists have been frustrated in their protracted campaign to access the official government land register, much of the desired information detailing the Ecumene 2000 7 (4) 0967 -4608(00) EU 2000 A Â© 2000 Arnold</page><page sequence="2">404 Hayden Lorimer country's concealed patterns of landownership has been unearthed following painstaking personal Odysseys of empiricism. The striking results reveal that 50% of Scotland's 19 million acres is held by 608 landowners, and that over half of the privately owned rural land in the country is controlled by fewer than 350 lairds.2 The reformist project has been advanced still further with Callander's exhaustive enquiry into the byzantine land laws and statutes which continue to determine 'How Scotland is owned'.3 These works bring an impressive bank of statistical evidence and legislative explanation into the public domain. However, the starting-point of this paper recasts the original question once again, widen- ing its scope to ask, 'How has Scotland kept being owned?' Obviously, a wide range of responses can be devised to what might seem, on initial inspection, an unhelpfully abstract or gnomic enquiry. Stark dialectical explanations based on the profit motive and the primacy of material wealth have been found for the oligarchic control of the nation's land resource.4 Meanwhile, the continued failure of the state to intervene decisively, and thereby counter- act the excesses of an open land market, has also provided the basis for several considered enquiries.5 Such interpretations are not discounted here, but are understood through the more fluid ideological context of hegemonic power. Acknowledging the cultural shifts, political impulses and social agents which operate in conjunction with these structural forces allows for a broader reading of the exercise of power in Scottish society. This paper problematizes the bond of legitimacy which continues to unite landowners, traditional blood sports and landscape conservation in the Scottish Highlands. Focusing on developments during the interwar years, it investigates the cultural traditions, discursive prac- tices and sophisticated rhetoric utilized by the region's landowning and sport- ing community in defence of the established practice of stalking deer forests. The term 'deer forest' is itself a misnomer, since these are areas of moor and mountainside long denuded of trees, only retaining the arboreal association in their title. The definition remains a nebulous one, but normally implies a tract of land populated by deer to the exclusion of other grazing animals such as sheep or cattle.6 In 1919, the national acreage permanently held as deer forest covered a vast area amounting to some 3 432 385 acres, almost 19% of Scotland's total land area.7 The interwar period has been recognized previously for insta- bility and uncertainty in the ownership of Highland estates; a situation brought on by a combination of mounting public criticism, punitive death duties, gov- ernment inquiries into the viability of deer forest land use, the increasing com- mercialization and syndication of sporting activities and the forced resale of aristocratic properties to less 'appropriate' investors.8 Beyond these well-docu- mented difficulties, the decades between the wars were marked by lasting and intentional refinements in the interlocking rhetorics of sportsman and laird. Therefore, while demonstrating how authenticity and, as a corollary, legitimacy could be asserted through the active creation of links with past practice, I also examine how newly emerging discourses of nationhood and environmentalism presented more subtle means of persuasion. A wide range of archival materials and textual sources can be used to trace the evolution of this multi-faceted landowning manifesto. Significantly, these discursive strategies are heavily redo- Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="3">Guns, game and the grandee 405 lent of those deployed in current debates over the future of the Highland envi- ronment. This approach enables reflection on five cognate themes which frame the paper. Each of these themes can be understood as an individual conduit for the mediation of social power. In combination they formed a complex and coercive network of knowledge, or more specifically culture of nature, which the sporting community would come to rely upon. First I consider the cultivation of an authentic memory landscape based on a distinctive set of relations between humans and the 'natural' world; second, the importance of gendered and embodied identities in this outdoor culture; third, the connected social mores and representational practices of the British empire; fourth, the validation of stalking through a combination of rational (scientific) knowledge and irrational (sensual) experience; and finally, the close links fostered between sporting inter- ests and the formative Scottish landscape preservation movement. The cumula- tive force and interconnected nature of these five power structures support the Highland sporting narrative. Interpreting narratives of nature To suggest the dominance of a cultural hegemony based around the sport of deerstalking is not to rule out alternative interpretations of the Highland envi- ronment. Multiple 'cultures of nature' exist at all spatial scales from the local to the global, and these are at once contrasting, reflective and overlapping. This much has been accepted by key protagonists in debates over the social con- struction of nature.9 My work follows Urry and Macnaghten in recognizing diverse, contesting interpretations of nature which are created through, and can- not be separated from, social practices. Particular currency can be found in their assertion that 'questions concerning . . . whether hunting and shooting should be considered legitimate countryside pursuits ... all depend on assumptions and commitments concerning just what sort of space the countryside is'.10 More generally, their focus on the cultural production of meaning is undoubtedly a productive strategy, but recent dialogue across the social sciences which high- lights the potentially stifling effect of established nature-culture dualisms should not be overlooked.11 Acknowledging the difficulties caused by prioritizing the human imagination over non-human agency, a trait common to textual treatments of landscape in cultural geography, I use a specific historical situation to seek out messier prac- tical relationships where the traditionally fixed realms of nature and society are no longer so clearly defined.12 The deer forest is understood as a place where aspects of nature, culture, science and technology were able to fuse, separate and fuse once again to take on hybrid identities. Crucially, this network of altered sporting identities does not erase inequalities between human and non- human actors. As will become clear, racial, patriarchal, colonial and class struc- tures were crucial determinants in the bounding and politicizing of Highland nature. Throughout the course of the twentieth century, contestations over the own- Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="4">406 Hayden Lorimer ership, management and conservation of the Highland environment have been characterized by their variety and fluidity.13 These evolving discourses have been considered most recently by Macdonald and Togood who have consciously bro- ken free from a priori ideas of what constitutes the Highland environment, focusing respectively on the attempts of crofting communities and of the con- servation lobby to counter the hegemony of the sporting estate.14 Both authors have subjected these narratives to careful investigation and subtle forms of deconstruction. Perhaps understandably, therefore, these readings have included only brief and rather unproblematic representations of the traditional landowning community which such sociopolitical movements have sought to depose. Without seeking to dispute their validity, it is fair to say that these attempts to dissect the imagined traditions associated with the sporting land- scape and lifestyle have not developed beyond a very broad portrait of Highland anglicization and nineteenth-century romanticism. This same critique can also be levelled at numerous respected social histories of the Highlands in which, narratives of the 'Big House' having seemingly proved unpalatable, attention focuses solely on the emotive, genera- tional stories of dispossessed crofting communities.15 Too often, the sporting estate has been discussed in only rudimentary terms, then vilified in its 'given' monolithic state. Critically, my argument here is not devised as a means to dis- arm the political projects strategically concealed within these existing commen- taries. Indeed, by problematizing the particulars of stalking practice it actually ought to strengthen them. Neither should my argument be misconstrued as an attempt to prioritize, or indeed to falsify, one particular created narrative in the sharply contested geographies of the region. Rather, this paper illustrates the need to delve deeper than accepted wisdoms, much deeper than Edwin Landseer, Queen Victoria and Walter Scott, in order to take seriously the ongo- ing development of the hegemonic, conservative geographies of field sports and sporting estates. All this is not to suggest that the cultural politics of the deer forest up till now have remained entirely free from critical investigation. Several authors have added greater sophistication and nuance to 'traditional' understandings of the sporting estate. MacKenzie's examination of the social mores and environmen- tal attitudes linking Highland estates and far-flung colonies, as part of a more expansive investigation into human-animal relations on the imperial stage, is perhaps the most notable of these.16 Womack too has outlined how distinctive understandings of nature as 'native', and as 'history', were central to the devel- opment of sporting mythologies during the Edwardian years. This golden era is also the focus of Orr's work on the social and economic history of these vast properties.17 Gold and Gold detail the subsequent commercialization of Highland sport in line with the development of a modern tourist industry.18 Other studies have focused on the human element of this relationship. Jarvie has examined the continued symbolic importance of clan kinship, display and ritual to Highland lairds, while McCrone, Morris and Kiely have considered a more recent performative role, the landowners' self-promotion as modern cus- todians for the countryside.19 Meanwhile, in a characteristically provocative Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="5">Guns, game and the grandee 407 piece, Mcintosh draws on personal experience as an estate ghillie to question the psychodynamics of the laird-cum-sportsman.20 While the specific concerns of each of these studies resonate throughout this article, the broader, discursive issues of power and knowledge provide a unify- ing theme. I want to suggest that certain power relations in Scottish in ter war society allowed for, and certain institutional hierarchies enabled, the hegemonic control of the material landscape and its subsequent iconographie representa- tion. Thus, the paper's underlying purpose is to reveal the discourses of power which have been exercised in the creation of a dominant culture of nature in Scotland. It seeks to unpick the mechanisms, networks and strategies which have enabled sporting and landowning protocols to become 'normalized' in popular constructions of the Highlands.21 Couching my motivations in the starkest of terms, I want to shed light on current debates over possible land reform by thinking afresh about the social practices and power structures which led to the Highland environment existing in its present condition. This is achieved through a close reading of deerstalking as a discursively ordered and selectively embod- ied pursuit mediated through the creation of 'natural' and 'national' wilderness spaces. Thick mists of authenticity: mythology, landscape and memory I turn first to consider the purposeful deployment of vernacular narrative in the burgeoning mythologies and invented traditions which enveloped modern stalk- ing. Alert to the importance of folk memory in the construction of place iden- tities, the Highlands' sporting cognoscenti developed a selective reading of native history involving the landscape and its human and animal actors. This strategy of cultural appropriation served a dual purpose; to lend a burgeoning corpus of sporting publications a greater degree of authenticity and, more directly, to mask an increasingly incongruous presence in the material Highland landscape. Framed by recent work on the nature of memory, and memories of nature, the discussion here demonstrates how geographies, whether imagined or material, localized or expansive, could be convincingly coloured by historical and mythical precedent.22 The pursuit of deer, both as a pastime and as a livelihood, has a long history in the Scottish Highlands. Celebrations of these activities, preserved through several centuries in native Gaelic folklore, oral ballads and apocryphal yarns, were seized upon by the authors of stalking guidebooks, histories and personal reminiscences.23 Following James Macpherson's infamous flight of fancy, their vivid literary accounts were seldom hidebound by chronology or accuracy. Humans, animals and landscapes from different epochs were assimilated to sanc- tion the reconfiguration of local places, and their amalgamation into an elite wilderness space. Evidence from biblical times, classical civilizations and regal history was woven into a rich local tapestry.24 One enthusiast noted: Time has become nothing, we are surrounded with all the poetry of the deer forest of the ancient days - the poetry of Ossian. It is there seething and swimming around you.'25 The fusion of archaic events and contemporary experiences Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="6">408 Hayden Lorimer resulted in the curious melange of myth, legend and tradition for which the term 'Balmorality' was coined.26 Gaelic personalities were the next important thread linking past and present. A survey of interwar literature reveals a mem- ory-landscape peopled by an eclectic assortment of characters. Ancient Celts on horseback, clan nobility roaming hunting parks, romantic hunter-bards leading hunting dogs, free-foresters and maverick poachers, all haunted fireside whisky dreams in the shooting lodge.27 Dreams too could become reality. In 1928, to honour the arrival of his guest King Alfonso of Spain, the duke of Sutherland invoked the spirit of centuries past by organizing a 'traditional' mass deer drive ( tainchell ), where his estate staff swept the herds of the entire Klibreck hill-range into a carefully selected hunting-bowl. Although 4 an immense pair of striped bloomers' betrayed the monarch's failings in the art of camouflage, seven stags were successfully killed. For the event the duke had proudly drawn on his clan lineage, yet for the many sporting capitalists who lacked such a heritage, this provided little hindrance to the 'civilized' inheritance of 'barbaric' native tra- ditions. Like many traditions, the practice of stalking was presented as fixed, while actually having been subject to considerable alteration. Rather than 'tainchelling', the twentieth-century sportsman invariably hunted on foot, accompanied only by a local stalker, and was reliant on stealth to gain his honour. The history of the quarry in this purportedly venerable game was equally cru- cial to the sportsman's discursive ordering. Indeed, Philo's recent assertion that animals can 'become caught up in webs of power structured very largely from without' seems particularly apposite in this consideration of the cultural politics of modern stalldng, and more generally, elite sport.28 Matching the social stand- ing of their human foe, Highland red deer were granted an antiquarian her- itage and regal genealogy in the animal kingdom. A distinctive image first coloured from Edwin Landseer's palette, embedded the stag within the romance and wildness of a wilderness environment. George Eyre-Todd penned his own eulogy, noting how, 'with his branching crown of anders, his stately step, his love of the clean spaciousness and freedom of the bens, and his refusal to herd at ease with stall-fed beasts, the red deer on his native heath looks exactly what he is, every inch a king'.29 Tapping a similar vein, Allan Cameron identified the prey as 'the lineal descendants of the great European stags' which had 'pos- sessed the old Caledonian forest, in company with the wolf, the bear and the beaver, the white bulls and the Stone men'. He could therefore assure the suc- cessful sportsman that to bag such a specimen was to 'spill the blue-blood of prehistoric times'.30 Thus the stag's conditioned nobility could be transferred back to human predators, many of them vainly searching for aristocratic impri- matur. Such constructivist rhetoric, infused with notions of historical destiny and species primacy, made undoubted appeals to the racial and nationalist discourses which were articulated with increasing enthusiasm during the interwar period. The glorification of nature as a theatre for hunting was also integral to sport- ing rhetoric.31 Authorities on stalking stated quite definitively, although with lit- tle empirical grounding, that for the proper pursuit of a prize as elusive and retiring as the red deer, expanses of empty mountain wilderness were a primary Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="7">Guns, game and the grandee 409 requirement. In accordance with the spatial knowledge of the romantic tradi- tion, this was a feminine nature constructed at the margins of society, separated from civilization and unmediated by modernity. The Highland sublime was a shrine for spiritual renewal and introspection, taking the sportsman closer to his maker, a masculine God. Crucially, the invention of this 'traditional' sport- ing land ethic required the effective erasure of the emotive Clearances folk mem- ory.32 In sporting texts the place-image of a once peopled landscape was depoliticized and hollowed out, its mythology replaced by one of a pristine wilderness environment. This illusion of nature inviolate was distorted by internal contradiction. The sporting land ethic, grounded in the idea of seemingly boundless hunting spaces, was problematic when applied to matters of day-to-day game manage- ment. The limits of separate hunting territories were carefully demarcated on maps according to estate boundaries, and in line with the increasing commer- cialization of stalking, staked out with either metal-posted wire fencing or stone dykes.33 These boundaries were to be dutifully respected, and thus for the sports- man there was no more distressing sight than to watch a carefully tracked beast 'cross the march to the "enemy's country" '34 To discourage deer from flitting over these forest 'marches', each estate established an artificial 'sanctuary' in which animals were purportedly safe from stalking. This conversion of deer into commodities put a hefty price on each head, and an even more exorbitant one on each portion of wilderness. Further to these mounting incongruities, each neighbouring 'wilderness' was penetrated by a sinuous glen road, and on occa- sion a railway, built solely to service lavishly appointed shooting-lodges located at their very heart. By the interwar years, networks of hilltracks suitable for motorized vehicles were also centred on each lodge, constructed to ferry guests directly to the shooting grounds, thus avoiding the 'long-walk in'. Through each of these mechanisms the sporting industry placed controls over certain types of movement, while also constructing conduits to facilitate others. These affected both humans and animals, coercively and persuasively, but all ran contrary to the myth of natural freedom. Nevertheless, as with all evocations of the sporting ideal, Highland history, landscape and wildlife were entwined in an evolving 'culture of nature', founded on the need for historical legitimacy. The narratives attached to the unknown or folkloric were perfect for manipulation by the sporting community. By rewrit- ing aspects of native history on their own terms, they succeeded in associating themselves with the immemorial and immortal qualities of a natural Highland environment. Antiquity and memory were pacified, left open to exploitation by an informed elite who could allude to linkages between their own ancestry and antecedents of their choosing. In this fashion, both a legitimated identity and powerful level of social status were gleaned from the archaic past. As the next two themes demonstrate, cultural sophistication and even greater probity could be attained through the creation of a distinctive lifestyle to complement this colourful tradition. These sections outline how vigorous activities based on the hill were understood to foster physical, national, sexual and racial attributes. Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="8">410 Hayden Lorimer Sporting privations John McGrath, writer and director of the much-celebrated theatre production The cheviot, the stag and the black, black oil, once wryly confessed to his ' frequent astonishment', but 'ultimate disinterest', at 'where the connection between over- fed businessmen and crawling through wet heather came from'.35 Despite his politicized reservations, McGrath had pinpointed one of stalking's central appeals: its role as an embodied and gendered social practice. Since its Victorian reinvention, measures of masculinity have been crucial to modern stalking. The gentleman stalker breathed new life into vernacular sto- ries and legends which celebrated as their central theme feats of outrageous heroism, bravery and physical stamina. What most people viewed as acts of extreme folly, and at times outright stupidity, in the face of extreme danger were declared by the authors of 'testosteronie' stalking anthologies to be the quin- tessence of 'capital sport'. Sportsmen revelled in tales of hardy Highlanders tack- ling unwounded stags armed only with a knife, of protracted chases stretching over several days and of snatched sleep in the heather, wrapped in nothing more than a rough plaid. In The art of deerstalking , a seminal and eccentric instruction manual, William Scrope suggested that the sporting tyro should be able 'to run like an antelope and breathe like the trade winds'. Meanwhile, unsuspecting 'first-timers' about to set foot in the forests were encouraged to remove from the scalp any 'hyacinthine curls', as 'a man so shorn, with the addition of a lit- tle bog earth rubbed scientifically over the crown of his head, would be an absolute Ulysses and perfectly invincible'.36 While this ascetic doctrine was refined and affirmed throughout the Edwardian period, the interwar years brought with them unexpected reasons for concern. Following the sacrifice of a youthful generation on the Flanders fields, fears mounted over a perceived physical decline among the residual stock of menfolk. The heavy losses experienced among the aristocracy and officer classes, long-standing patrons of the stalking season, led experienced 'rifles' like Sir Iain Colquhoun, 7th Baronet of Luss, to mull over the portentous conse- quences for their established code of manhood (Figure 1). In 1925 he railed against an emerging and craven generation unprepared for their Highland rites of passages: they are fundamentally soft and not the least ashamed of it . . . when our young men cease to find pleasure in overcoming hardship, when they find no joy in scornfully refusing to admit the weariness of the flesh or in taking the last ounce out of them- selves . . . then personally I have little use for that 'sensible' type of sportsman. He had better confine himself to the low ground or the drawing room.37 Females, if not already discouraged from participating, were expected to enjoy the same atavistic discomfort.38 Amid a cultural climate characterized by a heightened awareness of the body, stalking was felt to offer its participants appro- priate standards of manhood, morality and anatomical proportion.39 Tinged with homoeroticism, descriptions of the finely tuned classical male body mirrored the respect shown for the power, athleticism and virility of the stag. If the model physique was Greek in origin, then the sporting spirit was definitely Corinthian. Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="9">Guns, game and the grandee 411 Figure 1 - Sir Iain Colquhoun, 7th Baronet of Luss and deerstalking enthusiast (J. Ross, The book of the red deer (London, Simpkin, Hamilton &amp; Marshall, 1925)) Throughout the chase, a gentleman's deportment had to be impeccable. The age-old patrician code of conduct, ground out on the playing-fields of Britain's public schools, would apparently ensure that the hunting remained 'civilized'. Thus certain ploys, giving a 'stag your wind', were approved of as 'fair play' while others, 'whistling up a stag', were most definitely frowned upon. Whether these stalking mores were honoured or flouted, the motivation behind Highland sport was resoundingly muscular. Dawn starts on the hill with a Purdey rifle tucked snugly under the arm, and the rich smell of gun oil in the air was sure to keep the lead in a man's pencil. For these racy and adventurous types, the privations enforced by nature at her most hostile and barren were integral to a full understanding of the body and the self. Masochistic pleasures could apparently be found in the unlikeliest of surroundings. To subjugate nature was to experience life at first hand; fac- ing the elements, scaling the heights, tracking the prey and finally taking it into your possession. If, as many believed, the stalk was a cerebral activity, 'a medi- cine for the mind' leading to a keener understanding of abstract themes such as life and death, then it was also an embodied practice replete with connec- tions to human sexuality, thus appealing to the sportsman's baser instincts.40 The anticipatory thrill of the hunt, further heightened by resistance and deprivation (dragging the prone body through wet heather), was detailed in suitably cli- mactic terms; the longer the stalk, it seemed, the better. While thankfully obscur- ing the full graphic details, Figure 2 illustrates how for the vanquished there Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="10">412 Hayden Lorimer Figure 2 ~ Carnal ritual on the shooting grounds (A.I. McConnochie, Deer stalking in Scotland (London, Witherby, 1924)) followed bleeding, the 'gralloch' (disembowelling), decapitation and, much later, the mounting of a 'trophy head'. For the lusty vainqueur, the visceral rit- ual culminated with a ceremonial blooding of cheeks, the toasted request 'More blood, sir?', and on special occasions the granting of 'freedom of the forest'. Only then could a return be made to the shooting-lodge for purgative ablutions and an evening of feasting.41 Paradoxically, acting in combination with these rites which indulged the cor- poreal so effectively, was a system of knowledge which effectively disembodied the sportsman. Extensive dialogues on the distanciated visual consumption of landscapes, and the subsequent gendering of sight, can undoubtedly be applied to the Highland deer forest.42 The sportman's possessive gaze, his field of vision and resultant experience of nature were borne out of a desire for territorial ownership, for omnipotence amid the solitude of the wilderness. The target of A.I. McConnochie's affection, in the following quote taken from his Deerstalking in Scotland, is of less consequence than the nature of his voyeuristic pleasure; 'Looking into the depths, some six hundred feet below me, my eye was caught by a curious shimmer of light on a pool of pearly water. Turning on the glass I had the prettiest sight of the whole day ... '43 This evolving occularcentrism found further practical expression during the interwar years. To 'grass' a stag required total visual mastery of the Highland landscape and, as the recumbent sportsmen in Figure 3 ably demonstrates, an essential skill in forest craft was the ability to 'glass the ground' effectively. In contrast to this reliance on the eye, the stag could call upon 'three facul- ties of sight, hearing and smell developed to an extraordinary degree'.44 Feeling Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="11">Guns, game and the grandee 413 Figure 3 ~ 'Glassing the ground' for deer in Glen Canisp (A.I. McConnochie, Deer stalk- ing in Scotland (London, Witherby, 1924)) the odds to be stacked too heavily against them, many marksmen adopted scopic devices perfected in warfare to enhance the limited abilities of the human eye. Equipped with trusty spy-glass and a high-powered, long-distance rifle fitted with telescopic sight, they could happily disengage all other senses. While the accepted shooting range in stalking was anywhere between 80 and 150 yards, such equipment made pot-shots from 500 yards an 'unsporting' possibility.45 Vast 'forest beats', the deer herds which roamed them, and those hill-walkers brave enough to shatter the illusion of privacy quickly became subject to these tech- nologies of surveillance, inspection, calibration and precision.46 Even allowing for this period of rearmament, Phyllis Bell still felt the hunted to have 'much in his favour, instinct and convention alike being on the side of the deer'.47 Alexander McConnochie was rather more circumspect; 'In the early days more attention was paid to the education of hand and eye than now, when the weapon used is so near perfection little is demanded from the man.'48 In truth, this all- seeing eye sanctioned the sportsman's authoritarian rule over animals, humans and the mountains. At once embodied and disembodied, the leisured sporting classes of the interwar period utilized various strategies of control in their artificial Highland fastness. Heroic expressions of Victorian masculinity, based on stability, fortitude and honour, were infused with more modish ideas concerning bodily culture and a mechanistically enhanced scopic regime. Each was crucial in this sharply gendered geography linking power, the body and a carnal form of knowledge. Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="12">414 Hayden Lorimer The fringe benefits of empire Proponents of deerstalking believed that the pursuit, while affording the 'self as vainqueur both bodily and spiritual gratification, could also serve the nation's collective purpose. Seeking further cultural embeddedness, aficionados por- trayed the Highlands as a stamping-ground for the formative patriot. Unsurprisingly, Sir Iain Colquhoun led the cavalry charge, maintaining that many a formative lesson in British citizenship had been taught on a rain-swept hillside.49 Hugh Gunn, a Sutherland-born imperial administrator, broadened the scope still further by tracking the sport's influence across the globe. In his essay, The sportsman as empire builder', he noted how '[t]he chase of the red deer had much to do with the spirit which stimulated the explorer and pioneer . . . for whenever exploration and the opportunity of the hunter have been com- bined, from the polar regions to the heart of the tropics, the sporting Briton has never failed to play a foremost part'.50 The renowned marksman Major John Ross concurred, proudly declaring that 'the sporting rifle has followed - often preceded - the Empire flag'.51 The feeling of mastery in the wilderness so famil- iar in Highland sport, the sense of thrusting into the unknown, the overriding belief in manifest destiny, all these 'Boy's Own' thrills were reputedly magnified on the colonial frontier. The same qualities of stoicism, independence and valour which the imperial adventurer was felt to embody, were part of the big-game hunter's armoury. The Highlands were a recognized stopping-off point on the grand tour of many a peripatetic sportsman, whether clad in pith helmet or kilt (Figure 4). Deerstalking was felt to perfect the fieldcraft of those with sights trained on the wildlife of the jungle or high veldt. When caught in a nasty pickle on the African savannah the footloose duke of Sutherland, a renowned shot throughout the colonies, doubtless cast his mind back to days spent on the Klibreck marches. Besides his Highland trophies, the pages of 'Geordie' Gower's autobiography were liberally peppered with snapshots of his imperial haul, among them lions, rhino, ibex, tigers, elephants, bison and gazelle.52 Meanwhile in the twilight of empire, with the wildlife conservation lobby exerting its influence over previ- ously uncontrolled sporting slaughters through the imposition of game laws, the Scottish mountains offered the returning imperialist a safe and secluded retreat. A lifetime of heading north each September left three loose cannons, Captain Christian Coombe, Sydney Loder and the duke of Portland, with personal tal- lies standing at well over 1000 stags. That many of stalking's great purists had undertaken long martial service provided further reason for triumphalism. John Ross doubtless had the infamous Lovat Scouts in mind when his thoughts drifted wistfully to 'the strains of the bagpipes played by a kilted Highlander arrayed in the tartan that his broadsword had made known in every quarter of the globe'.53 Meanwhile, Edinburgh University's professor of Celtic suggested that officers of the British army gained 'excellent preparation and discipline for warfare' from 'our modern autumn manoeuvres', in much the same way as the 'great hunts served the Gaelic nobles'.54 Standing lock, stock and barrel above any other pas- time, deerstalking it seemed, served higher purposes for king and country.

For A.G. Cameron their altruism knew no bounds. The sporting industry had drawn 'as by an irresistible magnet, the boundless stage of southern wealth and enterprise to the stony heart of our northern desert'.55 Critical to the future of this investment was the impo- sition of a distinctive hierarchical social structure, and thus a sense of order, on a region traditionally viewed as primitive, backward and peripheral. The stated intention of sporting lairds was to ensure only the gradual and controlled arrival of modernity to peripheral regions, while ultimately bequeathing to the local inhabitants the continuation of their simplistically rustic but civilized outlook on life. According to Sir Iain Colquhoun, political ideologies were not the province of his tranquil flock; 'What need is there here for high-sounding schemes, beloved by socialists, for universal equality and the brotherhood of man?' His Highland population worked to a more natural rhythm; 'Show me the man who loves the hills and I'll show you my brother '56 Lord Willoughby de Broke was similarly keen to emphasize the loyalty of the staff at his Highland pile: if you have killed a good beast, everything is all right. The whole establishment, from the head forester to the junior household, is delighted. They are British, just as you are. And all good British people love field sports, even if they have never been to the field. They are innately sensitive to the thrill cf the chase, it is in their blood.57 As MacKenzie has carefully argued, if hunting was an integral component in the culture of imperialism then the Scottish Highlands were inextricably, and complexly, bound up within its racial and geographical hierarchies. Noblesse oblige may have infused the lairds' rhetoric, but elite sport enabled the infor- mal imposition of an unmistakably colonial administration. The smooth run- ning of the estate required the measured humanization of colonized others who could be placed in a hierarchy of necessities alongside the prey itself. Workers and animals were expected to fall into line, their place and relative importance prescribed according to the events of the day, the season or the whims of the sportsman. Loyal service was duly rewarded. If field sports exerted strict social controls then simultaneously patrician social values promised to usher marginal and dependent peoples along the path to enlightenment. By the interwar years, local assimilation into a complex imperial network was evident in the working regimes of sporting estates and the damaging ideologies which provided their inspiration. Only a century before, the same region had been commonly asso- ciated with lawlessness, barbarism and serious threats to the British state and crown. With rebellion quelled, purportedly benevolent projects could be intro- duced with elite sport as their vehicle. The Highlands conversion from trou- blesome outpost to passive leisure space was complete.

This section outlines how the conclusions drawn on the life of the deer by a generation of sportsmen resulted in a complex animal identity based on a fusion of two seemingly dichotomous forms of knowledge; one irrational, constructivist and reliant on a febrile imagination, the other founded on rationality, empiricism and classifi- catory rigour. Valorized in tandem, these tall tales of 4 the one that got away' and examples of objective scientific inquiry created a hybrid sporting terrain some- where between the binary poles of nature and culture. Oppositions and inequal- ities were inherent in the human-animal relationship, but so too were empathy and the granting of agency or sentience. An examination of these complexities adds much greater nuance to Berger's claim that animals 'are the objects of our extended knowledge. What we know about them is an index of our power, and thus an index of what separates us from them.'58 Irrational and sensual stalking knowledge invoked natural history, geography and legend to powerful effect. As I have previously detailed, the owners, lessees and clients of Highland estates were keen to immerse their properties deeply in local lore. The many sporting anthologies and reminiscences published during the interwar years reflected this preoccupation. These treasure troves of the anecdotal were penned in florid prose by excitable sportsmen-authors who, although claiming to have carefully disinterred artefacts from the vernacular tra- dition, seldom let the truth get in the way of a good yarn. Anthropomorphic accounts from the hill granted the red deer remarkable levels of sentience, con- sciousness and intentionality of action. Certain animals gained infamy for their reclusiveness, some for their obdurate unwillingness to enter into the 'spirit of the game', and others notoriety for displaying unusual levels of cunning and tenacity. Particularly elusive or maverick stags were invested with an unworldly sublimity verging on the supernatural. Mythical monarch among them all was 'The MÃ¼ckle Hart of Benmore' which, after years of skilful evasion, was finally 'grassed' by the reputed marksman Charles St John, a scarcely credible seven days after his Herculean chase had begun. The duke of Portland's sporting rem- iniscences were typically fanciful, penned in a confessional whisper and forever haunted by mysterious and unsettling occurrences.59 Stories of accurately fired shots inexplicably passing through their targets and of cornered deer vanishing into a misty ether were recounted in all seriousness. Liminal experiences required transgressive beasts. Invariably, maverick stags were distinguished by their anatomical peculiarities, ranging from a disproportionate head size and vivid batde scars to distorted anders or unusually pigmented velvet.60 It was not unknown for the superstitious sportsman to carry a lucky silver bullet in his waistbelt. Granted a level of intentional agency to compare with its human adversary, the red deer became a popular subject for amateur studies in social behav- iouralism. For his Deer forest life (1932), A.I. McConnochie actually assumed the Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="16">418 Hayden Lorimer stag's persona to detail its emotional development through the life cycle.61 Curiosity, comradeship, courting, rutting, belling and mourning were noted as distinctive traits of the species and often explained by supposition, conjecture and wildly inaccurate guesswork.62 In fact, it was not until the observational stud- ies undertaken by Frank Fraser-Darling in Dundonnell during the 1930s that these behavioural patterns were subject to intensive ecological examination. This independent project was, however, entirely unorthodox. Much more represen- tative of the period were the attempts made by vested sporting interests to 'intel- lectualize' familiar arguments in favour of existing practice. Drawing on the scientific inheritance of the nineteenth century, rational stalk- ing knowledge stuck determinedly to the tenets of biological determinism with its insistence on human distinctiveness. The sporting hero differentiated him- self from, and ultimately transcended, the animal order. Just as John MacKenzie has noted how on the imperial stage the act of killing was legitimated by an 'understanding of the quarry, its environment and its anatomy', the Highland sportsman's understanding of the deer was sanctioned by respected doctrines from natural history, field study and the natural sciences. From a very early age, the gentleman 'rifle' was encouraged to learn about the flora and fauna of the forest. Seton Gordon, native of Royal Deeside and respected natural historian, and Harry Mortimer-Batten, an enthusiast of lesser renown, agreed that the art of deerstalking could easily be combined with studied observation of plant and birdlife.63 Intimacy and knowledge could also lead to compassion. The dukes of Sutherland and Westminster apparently found little tension between the close study of deer through a rifle's telescopic lens and their patronage of the north- ern branch of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.64 Sportsmen with artistic inclinations could also be accommodated, although, as Vincent Balfour-Browne bellowed, 'the pleasure of outwitting a deer for the sake of making a drawing of him is but very small beer compared to the joy of out- witting a deer because one wants to kill him'.65 Advice on mixing photography with sport was rather more limited, and in deerstalking the click of the shutter never threatened to supersede the glamour of the gun.66 Each of these field techniques - tracking, observation, sketching, pho- tographing, shooting - aided the scientific classification of the species within its ecological system. Such learning did not end on the hill but continued in the larder and the lodge. Since the modern reinvention of stalking, the careful tab- ulation of all kills had been integral to sporting ritual. Carcass weights, head measurements, antler lengths and crowns were noted in meticulous detail and recorded for posterity in each estate's game book. Prize stags were classified according to their antler points, 12 denoting a 'royal' and 14, the most rare of specimens, an 'imperial'. Aspiring sportsmen longed to enter the details of 'a magnificent royal, 15st clean, strong black horns, the points uniform, every one 10.5 to 11.5 inches long' next to their name.67 This desire to categorize nature, borne out of biological determinism, was further indulged with the publication of taxonomies detailing the statistical ephemera of the deer forest and illustrated by plates of dead prey on display (Figure 5).68 Superseding even these lavishly illustrated texts, the taxidermist's art ensured that the study and contemplation Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="17">Guns, game and the grandee 419 Figure 5 ~ Sporting classification of nature - an Ardnamurchan 'royal' (A.I. McConnochie, Deer stalking in Scotland (London, Witherby, 1924)) of animal trophies would continue among future sporting generations. Beyond the pleasurably arcane aspects of sporting field study, those with a stake in the land resource considered themselves important players in the devel- opment of cognate academic subjects such as ecology and zoology. Reflecting changing priorities across the sciences, the sporting community cultivated a keen interest in species experimentation and eugenics. However, these exploratory avenues of scientific research masked a more sinister subtext, where a cranky and bastardized sporting sub-discipline was able to develop. The quest for the ideal animal led several lairds with time on their hands into the uncharted reaches of genetic engineering and animal aesthetics. Despite the very obvious tensions with rhetoric which proudly proclaimed the pure genealogy of Scottish deer, a range of ill-advised tests involving foreign breeds were undertaken. Continental park stags and North American wapiti were imported to some forests to improve anatomical proportion, antler physiology and head unifor- Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="18">420 Hayden Lorimer mity. King George V introduced deer from the Windsor herds to Balmoral, Lord Trent did likewise in Ardnamurchan, while the duke of Portland transported several animals from the family seat at Welbeck Abbey to his Braemore and Langwell forests as a means to 'secure fresh blood'.69 Inspired by their quasi-Darwinian ethic, the Highland estates enforced a pol- icy of (un) natural selection on deer populations already kept artificially large to ensure plentiful sport.70 As Figure 6 makes evident, appearance was the key determinant in decisions over whether an animal should be preserved for another season or picked off as an undesirable contributor to the gene pool. Thus the extermination of 'switch' horns, ageing 'knobbers' and the lame was accepted practice. In one such encounter, the sporting arbiter noted that although die quarry 'had a big body, his head was worthless and his teeth were much worn; in short, he was a mere cumberer of the ground'.71 Combined with Figure 6 ~ Experimentation, classification and the search for the animal ideal in the Highland deer forest (A.I. McConnochie, Deer stalking in Scotland (London, Witherby, 1924)) Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="19">Guns, game and the grandee 421 the out-of-season culls undertaken by estate staff, these game management strate- gies were intended to ensure that only the strongest and most physically appeal- ing specimens would survive. With funding provided by the British Field Sports Association, after its formation in 1931, certain estates were ring-fenced as open- air laboratories. Agriculturalists, forest zoologists and botanists were commis- sioned to work on species improvement projects, experimental feeding systems, disease eradication programmes and new game management regimes. All were introduced under the guise of scientific endeavour and promoted as advancing ecological knowledge.72 In combination with their ghostly and freakish animal fantasies, sportsmen had classified and rationalized the red deer as their macro- fauna in the Highland environment. Conscious of increased public revulsion at stalking as a form of leisure, they had initiated a self-styled conversion into mod- ern ecologists which would continue throughout the century. Sporting custodians of the landscape It was but a short step along this track to the development of a comprehensive sporting land ethic, the fifth 'normalization' mechanism in the sporting 'cul- ture of nature'. In this final section I examine how during the interwar years the sporting lifestyle and its natural arena, the Highland wilderness, were reworked to help propagate the idea of an authentically 'Scottish' landscape which was worthy of preservation. This idea has been so compelling, and myth so beguiling, that according to McCrone, Morris and Keily, 'cleared estates have come to represent landscape in Scotland just as soldiers in kilts inform our image of what it is to be a Scot'.73 Critically, I demonstrate how a powerful institutional network became the medium for this message. Having carefully devised a national and populist mandate for themselves, the voluntary organizations con- stituting Scotland's nascent landscape preservation and heritage movement were in a prime position to determine the public mood. Very often the grateful recip- ients of lionized histories detailing their part in Scodand's proud civic tradition, the role of the Association for the Preservation of Rural Scotland (APRS) and the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) are here exposed to more critical exam- ination.74 In the immediate aftermath of war, the predominantly patrician membership of the Scottish Land and Property Federation noted with mounting anxiety how 'encroachments on the principle and rights of private ownership in land' were being 'camouflaged under such general phrases as "the national interest", "the national welfare" and the "equal rights of every man in the soil of his country" '75 Bouts of political activism combined with improvements in road and rail networks, changing employment regimes and the explosive growth of a clamorous outdoor recreation movement meant that their wilderness was no longer guaranteed as a place of splendid isolation.76 Modern industrial devel- opments, public intrusion, traffic congestion and possible state intervention in the landownership system became genuine concerns in previously tranquil Highland surrounds.77 Some valuable lessons in public relations quickly learnt, the sporting-landown- Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="20">422 Hayden Lorimer ing community skilfully commandeered the slogans and strategies of their oppo- nents. Prominent lairds, most notably Sir Iain Colquhoun, the duke of Atholl and Sir John Stirling-Maxwell, provided the impetus for the formation of the APRS in 1927, and its sister organization, the NTS, in 1930. Indubitably charis- matic, they were figureheads for a patrician coterie who would come to domi- nate Scotland's new circuit of voluntary organizations. Under their studied patronage, the APRS and NTS were afforded immediate gravitas and propriety, while the critical issues of landscape amenity, scenic conservation and the preser- vation of heritage features were expertly manoeuvered into the public domain. While stability, continuity and tradition were to become bywords of both bod- ies, infusing their every aspect from appointments of high office to organiza- tional insignia and royal charters, concurrently they succeeded in parading themselves as bastions of modern democracy, aesthetic civility and the common good. Indeed, while questions over Scotland's future identity within the Union were the staple of enlightened society, the NTS and APRS grasped the initiative by identifying nationhood, and self-salvation as the new lingua franca.78 Theirs was an articulation of sentimental, or perhaps more specifically environmental, nationalism; an affirmation of the fierce pride held in the unique character and distinctive history of the Scottish landscape, but still framed by a firmly pro- Unionist agenda. Although the membership of both organizations was largely confined to the 'lairdocracy' and to concerned circles of civic society, their rhetoric was directed towards the populace at large. In such a fashion, the traditionally circumspect and conservative landed elite were seen to be embracing progressive notions of national and civic responsibility. When, on assuming his presidency of the APRS, the master of Polwarth identified 'rural Scotland as the real Scotland', his choice of vocabulary was careful and no glib assertion.79 Similarly, in a celebration of the Trust's legislative power to acquire property on the public's behalf, Sir John Stirling-Maxwell noted how it would serve 'the nation as a sort of cabinet into which could be put some of its valuable things where they would be perfectly safe for all time'.80 The central message of the landscape preservation and her- itage movement was clear: an adherence to the tenets of rural preservation and nature conservation already existed among a community of custodians whose prime source of wealth lay in the land itself. By helping maintain millions of acres in their 'proper' wilderness state, and protecting them from unnecessary development, Scotland's sporting landowners were, in effect, serving as noble stewards for the country's treasured historical landscapes, their associated folk memories and venerable traditions.81 The role of the NTS and APRS was to for- malize this established commitment within a modern institutional structure. Various means were employed in this push to safeguard Scotland's rural heritage and preserve its iconic landscapes. The majority also functioned as veiled mechanisms for the consolidation of the sporting hegemony in Highland society, and its repackaging as a buffer against iniquitous development. These strategies ranged from clandestine lobbying directed at derailing campaigns for central government intervention in the establishment of national parks or hydro- electric power schemes, to the continued prioritization of the aesthetic and the Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="21">Guns, game and the grandee 423 vernacular in rural affairs, with a consequent circumvention of more funda- mental issues relating to economic development. Sub-committees busied them- selves with the subde regulation of public access to the mountains and carefully judged confirmations of the importance of sport to rural communities and their environment.82 At the helm on so many occasions could be found Sir Iain Colquhoun, fondly remembered in Trust lore as someone 'who personified the romantic notion of the Scottish laird and soldier'.83 Always aware of the pre- carious balance to be struck between public pronouncement and private pledge, Colquhoun acted as an amiable and avuncular go-between, carefully bonding the Scottish preservation movement and the country's sporting community. As a permanent fixture on the civic circuit he was in regular contact with fellow landowners, and through him private problems could be aired, tactics discussed, confidants sought out, fingers pointed and government mandarins contacted.84 Negotiations in the hushed corridors of power were backed by localized activ- ities among a flourishing provincial network. Recruitment drives to establish local branches of the APRS in Stirlingshire, Cowal, Moray and Nairn, Skye, Dumbartonshire, Argyllshire, Fort William, Kingussie and Inverness drew heav- ily on the landed gentry and sporting set.85 Local politics remained the domain of these dignitaries, and only four years after its formation the APRS could boast a member on nearly every county council in Scotland. One tightly knit network of power and influence serves as illustration. The reformation of an Inverness- shire chapter of the Association in 1937 was marked by a garden party at the country seat of Baroness Burton. Presiding over the day's events, Major Evan Baillie of Dochfour, the laird of Cluanie and Glenshiel deer forests, was pleased to welcome Cameron of Lochiel, the major landowner in Lochaber and chair- man of Inverness-shire county council. I.R.J.M. Grant, laird of Inverwick forest, was appointed chairman of the country committee, while the ageing Mackintosh of Mackintosh, proprietor of Coignafern and Inshreach estates, assumed the position of president.86 When their services were called upon, the denizens of Highland society could flex their sporting muscle. Paying tribute to the life of the Mackintosh of Mackintosh the following year, one particularly obsequious obituarist noted how 'an honourable man, a dutiful laird, a progressive landowner, an exemplary representative, an unhesitating patron, and a thorough sportsman are all characters of the Highland gentleman'.87 The sporting laird, with his intuitive knowledge of the Highland environment, native ancestry and romantic joie de vivre was a constituent element in an increasingly attractive and persuasively marketed package. Conclusion While it would be reckless to suggest that each of the varied projects carried out in the name of landscape preservation were geared towards sporting ends, it is reasonable to argue that the overarching agendas of the NTS and APRS were determined by an exclusive cabal who stood to lose heavily if changes to the established social and cultural order of the Highlands continued apace. Certainly progressive, but also politically astute, their representatives placed Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="22">424 Hayden Lorimer themselves centrally within the evolving countryside lobby. Particular conces- sions arose out of the positional manoeuvre which moved the laird to the heart of Scotland's civic life, but crucially the sporting land ethic and its sophisticated mythology would survive unscathed. Little more than a decade after the formation of the APRS and NTS, these patrician agents of change were close to succeeding in their quest to transform the ecologically degraded sporting environment into a treasured cultural rep- resentation of the Scottish landscape. While some of the aristocracy's largest deer forests had been subdivided and sold on in 'smaller' lots, their continued use for stalking was seldom in question. Those losses of sporting acreage incurred during the interwar years were attributable mainly to the activities of the Board of Agriculture and the newly established Forestry Commission.88 More critically, the period was characterized by the careful sculpting of an already compelling imagined narrative. Both human and animal inhabitants of the sporting estate were coloured by complex politics of identity. The history of deer- stalking, its links with Gaelic tradition, its masculine and bodily standards, its cultural mores, its aristocratic, regal and imperial associations and its easy assim- ilation of scientific innovation and ecological understanding all became tradi- tions of which the nation could be proud. Binding together these disparate tokens of authenticity was the popularized concept of a pristine and preservable Highland wilderness. Adapted for consumption by a mass audience in search of the great outdoors, and naturalized to the extent that for many years it was barely questioned, this sporting 'culture of nature' has proved both durable and malleable. While dynastic lairds continue to play a part in the composition and chosen agendas of Scotland's landscape conservation organizations, the personnel who represent today's sporting community have changed markedly. Yet crucially, a great many continue carefully to exploit the nexus between power, authority and knowledge which landownership affords. However, the ceding of political power to Scotland's newly devolved parliament has already altered this landowning landscape. Recendy announced proposals for land reform, combined with threatened legislative action on blood sports, represent perhaps the most potent challenge to this hegemony.89 However, it is worth noting that recent responses from the Scottish Landowners' Federation defending the rights of their mem- bership have been couched within the framework of sustainability, the new lan- guage of public environmentalism, and have sought to draw on the recent successes of bro^d coalitions such as the British-wide Countryside Alliance, which has veiled its defence of blood sports behind an eclectic manifesto of rural preservationism.90 The events of the interwar period illustrate how Highland sportsmen and landowners, a community commonly associated with stability and monolithic power, actually benefited from a dynamic spirit, relying instead on formidable skills of assimilation and transformation. While the winds of change do now appear to be blowing in a more equitable direction, evidenced by long- awaited community 'buy-outs' in localities such as Assynt, Knoydart and Eigg, widespread land reform is not yet a fait accompli .91 Thus it may still be worth ask- ing: what price the Highland landowners' next protean disguise?

Afterwards, having refused to play bridge, they make a spasmodic series of unintelli- gible remarks, and having obtained early permission from their hostess, yawn them- selves gratefully to bed': Ross, The book of the red deer , p. 110. Such bombast comes from a fervent advocate of the outdoor life who regularly stalked the hills of his Sloy estate barefoot and dressed in a simple kilt.

It is interesting to note that the other recorded example of stalking in bare feet was by the renowned naturalist Frank Fraser Darling. While undertaking his ground-breaking study of deer behaviour among the herds of the Dundonell mountain range he did away with his shoes in an attempt to move more naturally, and furtively, across the hillsides. Darling blithely reported: 'after a fortnight of discomfort I had my reward. The whole thresh- old of awareness was raised, I was never fatigued, and stalking became very much eas- ier': F. Fraser Darling, A herd of red deer: a study of animal behaviour (London, Oxford University Press, 1937), p. 27. 39 The connections between outdoor activities and body culture in British interwar soci- ety are discussed in D.

The promotion of sight in Western knowledge is understood as a strategy of legitimation for a range of classificatory projects, characterizing and entwining imperial exploration and empirical science. Developing this work, Pratt and Merchant have interpreted the visual consumption of landscape as a masculinist pro- ject, seeking through science and objectivity to create a single, unified feminine nature. Similarly, O'Tuathail suggests that 'the prioritization of the male over the female, the mechanical over the organic, mind over passion, and the objective over the situated were necessary conditions for the construction of any aspiring science by the nineteenth century'.

Of that total, how- ever, only 148 338 acres were suitable for conversion to agricultural smallholdings. Much of the remainder combined stock grazing with deer forest. Meanwhile, the Forestry Commission had managed to purchase 540 663 acres by the end of the 1930s. While this made it the largest landowner in Scotland, only 344 590 acres of its new holdings were suitable for conversion from deer forest.
