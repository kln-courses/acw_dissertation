<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lapita and Oceanic Cultural Origins: Excavations in the Mussau Islands, Bismarck Archipelago, 1985 Patrick V. Kirch University of Washington Seattle, Washington The Lapita Cultural Complex, ranging 5,000 km from the Bismarck Archi- pelago to Western Polynesia and spanning the period 3600 to 2500 B.P., represents the initial colonization of the sw Pacific by Austronesian peoples. Recent work in the Bismarck Archipelago, the putative Lapita "homeland," has yielded new data on the initial phases of the Complex. This report sum- marizes excavations at three Lapita sites in the Mussau Islands. In addition to classically-decorated ceramics, the sites produced a wide array of porta- ble artifacts, faunal materials, and anaerobically-preserved wooden architec- ture. The implications of these data for Lapita origins, economy, and long- distance exchange are discussed. Introduction For decades, the problem of cultural origins beguiled Oceanic anthropologists. Approaches ranging from kul- turkreise (culture area) trait comparisons through anthro- pometric and blood serum studies to lexicostatistical matrices fueled the debate but failed to yield convincing results. Only with the advent of modem stratigraphic archaeology in the 1950s and 1960s did a resolution to the problem begin to take shape. Golson (1971) was one of the first to point out that widespread finds of a dis- tinctive ceramic ware-termed Lapita after a New Cal- edonian locality-represented a "community of culture" more ancient than the ethnographic boundaries separat- ing Polynesia and Melanesia. Subsequent work has now shown the Lapita Cultural Complex to be an archaeo- logical horizon of fundamental significance to Oceanic anthropology and prehistory, representing the first hu- man incursion into the remote Pacific and thus the "foun- dation culture" from which the myriad societies of Polynesia, eastern Micronesia, and island Melanesia ul- timately descended (Bellwood 1979; Jennings 1979; Kirch 1984). This paper summarizes new results from the investigation of the oldest known and most westerly- situated Lapita sites yet discovered. Geographically, Lapita sites are distributed from the Bismarck Archipelago in the west (FIG. 1), through the Melanesian island arcs of the Solomons, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia, to Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa in the east. Numerous radiometric dates bracket the time span for initial Lapita expansion and settlement from about 3600 to 3200 B.P. (Green 1979: table 2.1). Ceramics, the most distinctive aspect of Lapita assemblages, comprise non- wheel-made, relatively low-fired earthenware with sev- eral vessel shapes (including flat-bottomed dishes, bowls, and a variety of carinated and non-carinated jars and pots), decorated principally by dentate-stamping but also by incising and appliqu6 (Mead et al. 1973; Don- ovan 1973; Anson 1983). Green (1979) reviewed the range of non-ceramic data, including settlement patterns, subsistence, and general material culture, which permit the delineation of a Lapita cultural complex. Based both on radiocarbon chronology and on a de- tailed analysis of the decorative motifs on Lapita ceram- ics, Green (1979), Spriggs (1984), Anson (1983), Allen (1984), and others have argued that the most likely region in which to seek the immediate origins of Lapita is the Bismarck Archipelago, lying NE of the large island of New Guinea and including New Britain, New Ireland, New Hanover, the Mussau Islands, and the Manus group (FIG. 1). Although Lapita sites were reported in this re- gion as early as 1909 (Meyer 1909), the area has been seriously neglected in recent decades. Most archaeolog- ical research on Lapita has concentrated instead on sites in the eastern Solomons, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, and Fiji-West Polynesia (Birks 1973; Garanger 1972; Gifford and Shutler 1956; Green 1976, 1978; Green and Dav- idson 1974; Groube 1971; Hedrick 1971; Kirch 1978, 1981; Poulsen 1968). In short, there has been a serious bias in Lapita archaeology, with a focus primarily on the region into which fully-developed Lapita expanded, rather than in the putative "homeland" region in which the unique aspects of Lapita are presumed to have de- veloped. In order to redress this bias and to seek new data on Lapita origins and development, a major multi-institu- tional program was organized in 1984-85, under the</page><page sequence="2">164 Lapita and Oceanic Cultural OriginslKirch MUSSAU ISLAND ADMIRALTY ISLANDS Emananus Is-.

This Lapita Homeland Project involved the co- ordinated efforts of 11 separate field teams, each inves- tigating a key area in the Bismarck Archipelago and all sharing a common research design. (Aside from the ANU, the participating institutions are Sydney Univer- sity, The Australian Museum, University of Auckland, University of Hawaii, and the Burke Museum of the University of Washington.) The Mussau group (lying NW of New Ireland) was chosen for intensive fieldwork because earlier reconnaissance survey and test excava- tions by B. Egloff of the Papua New Guinea National Museum (Egloff 1975; Bafmatuk, Egloff, and Kaiku 1980) had revealed at least two sites containing dentate- stamped ceramics. These sites are among the most west- erly Lapita localities on record and yielded the oldest known radiocarbon age from any Lapita context: 3900 + 260 B.P. The Mussau Project team landed on Eloaua Island via the expedition ship Dick Smith Explorer on August 1, 1985. Mr. John Saulo, Assistant Curator of the Papua New Guinea National Museum, joined the team during the latter half of August. We departed Mussau on Sep- tember 20, having spent 51 days in survey and excava- tion work. Three Lapita sites were intensively investigated, with 41 sq m excavated, yielding a collec- tion of ceramics, portable artifacts, and faunal materials virtually unparalleled in diversity, quantity, and quality of preservation at any previously-excavated Lapita lo- cality. This report summarizes these materials and dis- cusses their implications for our understanding of the Lapita Cultural Complex. The Research Area The Mussau or St. Matthias Group (1490 37' E, 1' 26' S) lies about 150 km NW of New Ireland and is dominated by a large, high island (today called Mussau, although traditionally unnamed, according to infor- mants), about 31 km long, 16 km wide, and rising to a central peak 650 m amsl. Our 1985 survey focused on the cluster of 11 smaller islands of coral-reef origin situated just off the sw side of Mussau (FIG. 2). The larger of these, Eloaua (7.6 x 1.7 km) and Emananus (4.4 x 1.6 km), form a small atoll with a classic open</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 14, 1987 165 MUSSAU IS.

Three Lapita sites are situated on these two islands, and later aceramic middens are also located on Emussau, Boliu, and Ebolo islands (FIG. 2). Eloaua and Emananus, similar in geological structure, consist partially of upraised reef platforms and terraces (maximum elevations of 51 and 45 m respectively), surrounded by more recent unconsolidated calcareous sands. Although the uplifted reef topography evidences former tectonic activity, there is no indication of signif- icant changes in relative sea level within the past 3000- 4000 years. Because the basal geology of these islands is entirely biogenic, any igneous or metamorphic man- uports in Lapita deposits are clearly of exotic origin. Informants claim that volcanic rocks are also absent on the main island, and oven stones are at present imported from the Tabar Islands near New Ireland (FIG. 1). The Mussau group lies within the humid tropics, with a "continuously heavy" rainfall regime (Brookfield and Hart 1971: fig. 1.4); annual rainfall exceeds 3000 mm. Dense rainforest cloaks the main island, but the smaller offshore islands including Eloaua and Emananus exhibit a largely anthropogenic vegetative mosaic, including shifting cultivation and secondary regrowth. The land fauna includes a large variety of birds (Hartert 1924), several fruit bats (Pteropus spp.), a cuscus (Phalanger sp., an aboreal marsupial), feral pigs, a variety of small reptiles, and the edible coconut robber crab (Birgus la- tro). Virulent, endemic malaria imposes a serious con- straint on the human population (including susceptible archaeologists). The atoll-lagoon ecosystem surrounding Eloaua and Emananus supports an extremely diverse and rich array of marine resources, all of which were exploited by Lapita populations. Broad reef flats extending more than 1 km from the islets provide varied habitats for molluscs and crustacea, and these as well as the inner lagoon and open sea support a wide range of inshore, benthic, and pelagic fishes. Sea turtles are abundant and the sea-going crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) is an occasional hazard. The human population of about 2000 Austronesian- language speakers resides in several small villages dis- persed around the coast of the main island and on Eloaua and Emananus. There are no interior settlements on Mus- sau. The local economy is oriented toward semi-tradi- tional subsistence gardening and marine exploitation, with some cash-cropping of copra. Ethnographic data are confined principally to the early German works by Parkinson (1905), Danniel (1901), and especially Nev- ermann (1933). Lapita Sites and Their Environmental Settings Three sites containing Lapita ceramics were discov- ered, two on Eloaua and one on Emananus (FIG. 2). Each has a three-letter site designation in accordance with the Papua New Guinea national site registry scheme. ECA, the largest site, extends across at least five named garden tracts (Talevungateo, Etanamakapa, Talepongakoa, Tal- epakemalai, and Taleiubua), with surface sherds and obsidian covering an area of approximately 85,000 sq m. At this scale, it is the largest Lapita site on record</page><page sequence="4">166 Lapita and Oceanic Cultural Origins/Kirch anywhere (cf. Green 1979: 49-57). A roughly graded landing strip for small aircraft, constructed in 1973, disturbed about 25,000 sq m through the central portion of the site and led to its initial discovery (Egloff 1975). ECA virtually straddles Eloaua Island at a point where the island begins to narrow substantially. The ECA Lap- ita deposits do not extend to the present shorelines, but are confined inland of two parallel beach ridges, repre- senting former sw and NE shorelines of the island. The second Eloaua Island site, ECB or Etakosarai, lies just west of a trail crossing the island at its narrowest point (FIG. 2). This site also occupies a former beach terrace, with an old shoreline feature sloping abruptly to the east of the site edge. Thus, the narrow neck of land lying at present between the ECB and ECA sites was formerly an open channel, with a Lapita occupation on each side fronting a shallow reef flat. Much smaller than ECA, ECB has a surface area of about 6,000 sq m. The site surface, exposed and disturbed by subsistence gar- dening, is littered with large midden shells, obsidian flakes, and sherds. The EHB site, Erauwa, occupies a narrow, former beach terrace lying directly inland of a dense mangrove (Rhizophora spp.) swamp on the NE lagoon shore of Emananus Island. This beach terrace presumably formed at a time prior to the colonization of the reef flat by mangroves. The site is covered in second growth and mature coconuts, with numerous fire-cracked oven stones, shell midden, sherds, and obsidian flakes visible among the undergrowth. Land crabs, whose large bur- rows penetrate the site at frequent intervals, continually bring these cultural materials to the surface. In sum, all three sites occupy coastal beach-terrace environments that would have provided fine canoe land- ings as well as ready access to the rich marine resources of lagoon and open sea. Higher terrain immediately in- land of each site is suitable for shifting cultivation and tree cropping. The Lapita cultural deposits are no more than 1-2 m above present mean sea level, and site geo- morphology provides no evidence of significant changes in relative sea level since Lapita occupation. Shoreline changes have been limited to the accumulation of cal- careous sands and closure of a former channel between ECA and ECB due to longshore transport of sand grains (following the dominant current flow) from SE to Nw along Eloaua Island and mangrove colonization of the reef flat seaward of EHB. The Excavations The ECA site received the greatest attention, with a total of 33 sq m excavated; site ECB had 6 sq m tested, and EHB had only 2 sq m tested. The large sizes of these sites, undifferentiated on the surface (i.e., lacking any structural or topographic features of cultural origin), and largely cloaked in dense tropical vegetation, neces- sitated a careful sampling approach. We were particu- larly concerned 1) to define site boundaries, 2) to determine the relationships of cultural deposits to geo- morphological features (such as old shorelines), and 3) to sample internal variation in stratigraphy and cultural content. For these purposes systematic transects were judged to be most appropriate, based on prior experience with similar sites in Tonga and Tikopia (Kirch 1978; Kirch and Yen 1982). At ECA, test units were excavated along E-W and N-S transects, while at ECB and EHB time constraints limited work to single transects run across the sites from the shoreline inland. At ECA, transect sampling was effective not only in defining approximate boundaries of the cultural deposit but also in locating two areas of densely concentrated and undisturbed cul- tural materials, both of which were subsequently sam- pled through larger areal excavations (of 6 and 12 sq m, respectively). Excavation methods included metric grid control, ex- cavation by natural stratigraphy where possible (and ar- bitrary divisions within larger natural units), and screening of all material through 5-mm mesh. All cul- tural materials retained in the sieves were saved for analysis, including molluscan remains, vertebrate fauna, all non-local stone manuports, ceramics, and other por- table artifacts. With the exception of the northern part of ECA (de- scribed below), the stratigraphy in all sites was identical in its main characteristics. The Lapita occupations were originally formed on top of gently undulating, uncon- solidated dunes and former beach ridges of calcareous marine sands and reef detritus. Subsequent to site aban- donment, the shallow but organically enriched cultural deposits have been thoroughly reworked by gardening activity, which has continued to the present. As a result, the "fine structure" of the deposits has been almost wholly obliterated, and the typical stratigraphic profile consists of a dark grey garden soil (Munsell 10 YR 4/2) of silty-loam texture, about 10-25 cm thick, with an irregular, gradational boundary overlying the basal cal- careous sands. Lapita cultural materials are found throughout the garden soil, and the ceramics exhibit significant rounding from abrasion during cultivation. In the northern part of ECA, however, undisturbed cultural deposits occur well below the disturbed garden soil; these were investigated in two expanded excavations, de- scribed below. Area A About 60 m north of the airfield, Test Unit 13 of our second N-S transect yielded large sherds up to 75 cm</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 14, 1987 167 below surface, in concreted sands. A 6 sq m excavation unit, Area A, was opened 28 m west of Unit 13 to further explore these deposits. Throughout Area A, abundant sherds were present to a depth of 90 cm, along with molluscan and vertebrate faunal materials and shell artifacts, especially ring fragments of Conus shell. The matrix consisted of white to pale brown (Munsell 10 YR 8/2-3) calcareous marine sands lacking organic inclu- sions or staining, with no internal stratigraphic differ- entiation other than increasing CaCO3 cementation of sand grains with depth. At a depth of 90 cm the concre- tion had become too hard to excavate, even with the use of a heavy steel crowbar. As described further below, Area A yielded almost exclusively plain pottery of prob- able later date than the classically-decorated Lapita. Area B Also along the N-S transect, but 50 m further north of Unit 13, Test Unit 14 unexpectedly yielded a stunning array of large, well preserved, classically-decorated Lap- ita sherds beginning at a depth of 60 cm, coinciding with the top of the island's brackish water lens (the Ghyben-Herzberg aquifer). This unit was expanded into a 12 sq m excavation, producing the most significant results of the project. Throughout Area B, the water- logged sands below 60 cm contain an abundance of undisturbed, highly-decorated ceramics and associated cultural materials, along with the intact, anaerobically- preserved in situ posts of a wooden structure. Excavation of this deposit posed several problems, including the fragile nature of the sherds when first exposed (sherds became reasonably stable after drying, although the con- tinued presence of soluble salts poses a conservation problem) and the necessity of constant bailing during excavation (no pumps were available). Area B stratigraphy consists of three units, formed by post-depositional processes acting on what may origi- nally have been a single sedimentological unit (a rapidly prograding lagoon-foreshore environment). Layer I is the typical 15-20 cm-thick garden soil present throughout ECA. Layer II is a greyish brown (Munsell 10 YR 5/2) calcareous sand, with sparse distribution of cultural ma- terials. This unit is penetrated throughout by recent and collapsed land crab burrows, and the deposit has been depleted of cultural materials by the regular transport of objects upward by the land crabs, resulting in the "cul- tural enrichment" of Layer I. Land crabs, however, do not penetrate below the top of the Ghyben-Herzberg aquifer, which defines Layer III, a deposit of medium- to-coarse-grained calcareous sands with substantial reef detritus (especially branch coral). The lack of post-dep- ositional disturbance in Layer III is also indicated by the large sizes of most Lapita sherds and the absence of wear or rounding on old sherd breaks. Within the Area B excavation, 16 wooden post bases were exposed in situ, along with one horizontal timber. Within the zone of tidal fluctuation of the aquifer (Layer II/III interface), the posts are rotted and unstable, but are well preserved within the constantly wet, anaerobic environment of Layer III. Three large posts (D. 15-20 cm) form a cluster that is probably a house corner, with two alignments extending roughly south and east. A number of smaller posts or stakes cannot be related to the main alignments until further excavation is under- taken (planned for 1986). Two posts were removed for 14C dating and wood identification. The wood appears to be Intsia bijuga (D. Yen, personal communication 1986), a large tree noted for its long-lasting hardwood. Aside from the posts, there is a complete absence of other features (hearths, pits, ovens, etc.) typically as- sociated with Oceanic houses. Several lines of evidence, however, indicate that these posts supported a stilt house situated in shallow water at a time when the Eloaua shoreline was approximately 400 m inland of its present location. These include numerous sand-bottom-dwelling bivalves (Quidnipagus, Tellina) in death position (both valves intact) among the post bases as well as the ab- sence of features expected on a dry-land site. The li- thology of Layer III is typical of a marine foreshore, with unconsolidated sands grading into a higher-energy deposit of compacted branch-coral fingers and coral rub- ble. Further, the elevation of Layer III corresponds pre- cisely with the present range of tidal variation on the Eloaua lagoon flat. In sum, the evidence indicates that Layer III represents a Lapita stilt-house occupation sit- uated over shallow, quiet water immediately adjacent to the former shoreline (indicated by a topographic rise of about 1 m, some 30 m south of Area B). The excellent preservation of the Area B ceramics and other artifacts reflects their deposition off the stilt house directly into the surrounding shallow, sandy lagoonal muck. Progra- dation of the foreshore buried the deposit completely, creating an anaerobic environment suitable for the pres- ervation of the stilt-house post bases. The stilt house remains at ECA add significantly to our knowledge of Lapita architecture. Post molds, hearths, earth ovens, and other features associated with coastal dune dwellings have been identified at other Lap- ita sites (Green 1979), but the ECA remains are the first archaeological indication of stilt dwellings over open lagoons. Such stilt dwellings are widely known ethno- graphically from Melanesia, and the ECA evidence now suggests that this architectural form has substantial an- tiquity. Radiocarbon Dating Bafmatuk, Egloff, and Kaiku (1980) obtained two 14 age determinations from their earlier ECA excavations.</page><page sequence="6">168 Lapita and Oceanic Cultural OriginslKirch Table 1. 14C ages for Mussau Lapita sites.

(1982); shell ages after Stuiver, Pearson, and Braziunas (in press). The two samples were both from what is described as a single earth-oven feature, exposed in an excavation about 25 m east of our Area A. The samples yielded ages of 3900 - 260 B.P. (GX-5499) and 3030 - 180 B.P. (GX-5498). The former determination is the oldest 14C date for any Lapita site, but the large discrepancy in two samples from a single feature casts some doubt on their reliability. Eight radiocarbon samples have thus far been analyzed from our 1985 excavations: six from Site ECA and two from Site ECB (TABLE 1). Additional samples from ECA (Area A, and from the Area B wooden posts) and from EHB are still in progress. In Table 1, the initial sample results are presented both as "conventional 14C ages" (5568 years half-life), with adjustments for 13C variation, and as "corrected age ranges." The latter represent ca- lendrical calibrations at 95% confidence intervals, based on the correction tables of Klein et al. (1982) for the charcoal samples and on the recent correction charts of Stuiver, Pearson, and Braziunas (in press) for shell sam- ples. Calibration of the shell samples also takes into account the "reservoir effect." The results to date indicate that the basal levels of the ECB site date to the mid-second millennium B.C., while the various deposits at ECA span a range from the earlier half of the mid-second millennium up through the later first millennium B.C. So far, the earliest determination at ECA comes from Transect Unit 9, near the Nw edge of the site. The Area B deposits span a period from the end of the second millennium B.C. to the late first millennium B.C. The consistency of these age determinations also strongly suggests that the 3900 B.P. date obtained by Bafmatuk, Egloff, and Kaiku (1980) from ECA mate- rials should now be regarded as anomalous. These determinations are entirely consistent with the chronology of Lapita sites farther to the east (Green 1979: table 2.1) and support Green's contention that "Lapita sites as a cultural horizon date from between 1600 and 500 B.C." (Green 1979: 34). Indeed, the Mus- sau age determinations reinforce the idea that the Lapita dispersal throughout Melanesia to West Polynesia was extremely rapid. At the same time, they contradict the hypothesis of Allen (1984), Anson (1983), and others who propose that there was a lengthy period of Lapita development in the Bismarck Archipelago. Ceramics The Mussau excavations yielded approximately 15,000 sherds (TABLE 2), with about 10,250 of these from Area B of ECA. The sherd assemblages from sites ECB and EHB, along with that of ECA Area B, fall stylisti- cally within the range of variation known for classic Lapita ceramics and will be described as a unit. The ECA Area A ceramics, however, are distinctive and will be treated separately. The Lapita ceramics from Mussau are characterized by red to reddish-brown pastes, tempered primarily with fine-grained calcareous sand and shell detritus. Anson subjected a small sample of sherds from Egloff 's earlier ECA test excavations to compositional analysis, noting some variability in ECA fabric groups, which "may Table 2.

I also observed that a minor component of the assemblages is tempered with volcaniclastic sands of non-local origin, suggesting that either finished pots, or the materials for pot manufacture, were items transported within the Lapita exchange network. Detailed composi- tional analyses of both pastes and temper are planned for the future. The frequency of straight horizontal breaks, as well as an examination of incomplete bonds, indicate that vessels were constructed by slab building, and anvil impressions on sherd interiors suggest paddle-and-anvil finishing. The majority of body sherds have wall thick- nesses ranging from 8.5-12 mm, although some sherds of a thinner ware (5-7 mm) are also present. Vessels were fired at relatively low temperatures, probably with open fires, as suggested by a high percentage of unoxi- dized, carbon cores. All of these manufacturing char- acteristics are consistent with other analyzed Lapita assemblages (Golson 1971; Green 1979; Kirch 1978, 1981). Several vessel forms are represented in the assem- blages, the most common being large jars with everted or flaring rims (several variants are represented), flat- or round-bottomed dishes with flaring sides, and simple unrestricted bowls. There is little thickening or elabo- ration of rims, most lips being either flat or rounded. Many of the larger jars are sharply carinated, with the carination forming a lower border for the design zone. In addition to the vessels, there are several examples of large ring-type pot stands. Sixteen percent of all sherds from Area B are deco- rated, with 7% from EHB and 3% from ECB. The percentage of actual vessels that carried decoration was probably higher, however, since at Area B decorated rims outnumber plain rims by a factor of three. Two decorative techniques were used: dentate-stamping and incising. Although individual motifs could be executed with either technique, dentate-stamping and incising are rarely combined on a single vessel. The dentate-stamps used in decoration varied considerably in the fineness of teeth; most are larger (teeth ca. 0.75-1.25 mm wide), but some are very fine and needle-like (teeth ca. 0.5 mm wide). Some commonly-occurring design motifs are illus- trated in Figures 3, 4, and 5. The general Lapita design system underlying the Mussau sherd decorations has been analyzed by Mead et al. (1973), Donovan (1973), and others, in which a set number of recurring motifs are constructed by the geometric combination of a lim- ited number of design elements. Following the Mead system, the design elements present in the Mussau as- semblages include DE1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Motifs generally occur in horizontal bands between the rim and mid-point of the vessel (carination, or the base of flat-bottomed dishes), with some decoration on rim lips and in a narrow band on the inside of the lip. Design zones are delimited by specific zone markers, such as dentate-stamped or incised lines or bands (GZ1, 2, 3, and RZ3, 4 in the Mead system). As seen in the illus- trated examples, the motifs are highly geometric and dominantly rectilinear (although some curvilinear motifs</page><page sequence="8">170 Lapita and Oceanic Cultural Origins/Kirch Figure 4.

Among the specific motifs that have been identified, using the Mead-Donovan catalog, are: M1, 2, 7, 13, 19, 24, 29, 30, 39, 48, and 73. A number of new motifs not previously catalogued are also present. A particularly common design zone in the Area B ce- ramics consists of an M1 or M2 motif just below the rim, below which is an RZ3 or RZ4 band, and below that a large, complex geometric motif (such as M29, M39, or M73). Such a design zone is illustrated in Figure 5 A, B. A large number of the dentate-stamped designs have been filled in with a fine white material, either burned lime or a very fine white clay, causing the dec- oration to stand out sharply against the reddish back- ground of the vessel. Area A Ceramics The ceramics excavated from Area A of Site ECA differ significantly from those just described. The Area A sherds are almost wholly plain, with only three ex- amples of dentate-stamping and no incision. The paste is predominantly red (Munsell ranges 10 R 4-5/6-8 and 2.5 YR 4-5/6-8), with calcareous sand temper. There are several examples of red slipping (10 R 4/6). As with the classic Lapita assemblages, the Area A ceramics are low-fired (many carbon cores), slab-built, and paddle- and-anvil constructed. The sherds, however, have a somewhat smaller average thickness (ranging from ca. 4.5-8.5 mm). The majority of sherds come from large jars with strongly everted orifices, although some cari- nated bowls and simple bowls are also represented. The two decorated sherds from Area A are both ex- amples of Lapita dentate-stamping. One is from a cari- nated, wide-mouthed bowl, which carries a simple motif using Design Element 5 that has been lime-infilled. The other is a red-slipped body sherd exhibiting a single dentate-stamped line with a right-angle bend. In material, manufacture, vessel and rim form, and decoration, the Area A ceramics fall within what has elsewhere been termed the "Lapitoid Series" (Golson 1971; Kirch 1978, 1981; Kirch and Yen 1982) but prob- ably represent a later, simplified ceramic phase within the whole series. In most characteristics, the Area A ceramics are similar to the Tikopian Kiki Ware (Kirch and Yen 1982) and to the Anuta Island ceramics (Kirch and Rosendahl 1973), both dating to ca. 900-100 B.C., from the Eastern Solomons. They appear also to be similar to the plain ware recently excavated by J. Golson (personal communication 1986) at Lasigi on the east coast of New Ireland, and possibly to certain plain ware assemblages excavated by W. Ambrose in the Manus group (Ambrose, personal communication 1986). All of these assemblages demonstrate the widespread presence throughout Melanesia of later, "simplified" Lapitoid ce- ramics in the first millennium B.C. Lapita Material Culture The Mussau sites, especially Area B at ECA, yielded a wider range of non-ceramic artifacts than any previ- ously-investigated Lapita localities and thus greatly ex- tend our knowledge of Lapita material culture. A selection of these objects is illustrated in Figures 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, and will be briefly described here. Flakes and cores of obsidian are ubiquitous at all sites, although with one exception there are no examples of retouching to create distinctive tool types. Rather, flakes c~jl~ I :?:::::~:: "'"' ??-?? ?'-~'i~,?liii! ?..: .;.i ??.???~-:.~:?- ;??~ :.'.. ???.~I? .;??

In the Bismarck Archipelago, obsidian is known to occur naturally in only two localities: at Talasea on West New Britain and at Lou in the Manus group (Smith 1974; Ambrose 1976). A total of 167 obsidian flakes from sites ECA and ECB (excavated by Egloff) were subjected to proton-induced X-ray (PIXE) and gamma ray (PIGME) chemical analysis at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission Research Establishment (Bird et al. 1981; Ambrose and Duerdin 1982) and compared with known source materials from Talasea and Manus. All but five flakes could be attributed to their sources, with 72% from the Lou Island source in the Manus group and 25% from Talasea. In addition to obsidian, smaller quantities of several kinds of exotic stone are also present in the Mussau sites. Flakes of white and reddish chert (probably of biogenic origin), basalt, and other metavolcanic rocks are present in low frequency. There are also substantial numbers of volcanic, metavolcanic, and sedimentary manuports, some of which appear to have been used as</page><page sequence="12">174 Lapita and Oceanic Cultural Origins/Kirch ab 1/1 / 3 7 IX c / d 0 5cm i.-.,-3 I? I I I Figure 8. Conus shell rings from Area B, Site ECA. Items b and d are unfinished. oven stones. To our knowledge, none of these materials occurs within the Mussau group but were derived from a number of sources within the Bismarck Archipelago. Petrologic characterization and sourcing of these exotic materials is an objective of our continuing research. Stone adzes are represented by a butt fragment of finely-polished volcanic stone from Area B. ECB and EHB each yielded a large hinge-section adze of Tridacna clam shell. Small abraders and "whetstones" of volcanic rock, and of coral, are also present. All sites, but especially Area B at ECA, yielded large numbers of shell scrapers and peelers. One type consists of flat or gently-curved pieces of large pearl shell (FIG. 6A) with sharpened slicing edges, a form known ethno- graphically from the Mussau group (called gaulu). More common are peelers made from the dorsal caps of Cy- praea shells, with a curved peeling edge ground along the natural curvature of the shell (FIG. 6 B, C). Such peelers have only rarely been reported from other Lapita excavations (e.g., Anuta [Kirch and Rosendahl 1973] and Tikopia [Kirch and Yen 1982]) and provide sub- stantial evidence for the processing of vegetable foods at the Mussau Lapita villages. Also significant are two volcanic stones with pecked finger grips and slight bat- tering on one or two ends. Similar objects are known from other Lapita sites (Kirch 1981) and have been provisionally identified as hammers for cracking the en- docarps of hard-shelled nuts. Although Lapita sites characteristically contain large quantities of fish bone (Green 1986), fishing gear has been very rare. The Mussau sites, however, yielded an assortment of one-piece fishhooks (FIG. 7), made both of pearl shell and of large Trochus niloticus shell. Both incomplete (FIG. 7 A, B) and finished specimens were recovered. The size ranges suggest both inshore and benthic angling. Especially striking is the variety of beautifully-worked shell and bone objects normally grouped under the gen- eral class of "ornaments" (FIGS. 8, 9). While some of these may indeed have functioned as personal ornamen- tation, we suspect that many were parts of composite artifacts (utilizing perishable fiber and string) that func- tioned as exchange valuables. Certainly many of the forms represented in the Mussau collection are known as components of such items in later ethnographic con- texts (for example, the famous kula ring valuables, cf. Malinowski 1922: pls. XVI, XVIII). Included in the Mussau assemblages are a large number of Conus shell</page><page sequence="13">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 14, 1987 175 c d LA / e '- 0 5cm Figure 9.

Spondylus shell was used for small beads (FIG. 9 A, B) and larger bead or "necklace" segments (FIG. 9 H, J). Also represented are tooth-like pendants of shell (FIG. 9 C, D), double-perforated Conus shell plaques (FIG. 9 F), perfo- rated pig tusks (FIG. 9 E), perforated flying-fox (Pteropus sp.) teeth (FIG. 9 I), and a fish-shaped object of pearl shell (FIG. 9 G). While Lapita ceramics convey the importance of vi- sual art in Lapita society, and tattooing was known to have been practiced (Green 1979), few other expressions of Lapita art have ever been recovered archaeologically. The discovery at Area B of ECA of a small, finely- carved anthropomorphic image, made of heavy bone (probably cetacean), is thus noteworthy (FIG. 10). The figure is highly stylized and is reminiscent of the human face portrayed on a ceramic vessel from the Reef Islands RL-2 site (Green 1979: fig. 2.1). Faunal Remains A continuing debate on the nature of Lapita subsis- tence and economy has pervaded the archaeological lit- erature for almost two decades (Groube 1971; Kirch 1978; Kirch and Dye 1979; Green 1979; Hunt 1980; Best 1984). The Mussau sites, particularly rich in faunal materials, provide important new evidence with which to evaluate competing hypotheses regarding Lapita sub- sistence strategies. The 1985 excavations yielded more than 5000 vertebrate remains and in excess of 0.5 metric ton of molluscan material. The molluscs have been fully analyzed, while the vertebrate materials from Areas A and B of Site ECA have been sorted into major taxo-</page><page sequence="14">176 Lapita and Oceanic Cultural Origins/Kirch :Ay. 0l5cm 0 . . . I~' I I? I I I c I Figure 10. Anthropomorphic image of heavy bone. nomic categories. Further analyses of the vertebrates are in progress, especially on the dominant fish. The 4727 vertebrate specimens identified from the ECA Areas A and B excavations are itemized by major taxonomic classes in Table 3. About 75% of these consist of fish bone. Preliminary analysis of the fish specimens indicates that the collection is dominated by inshore, reef-dwelling species. Among the well-represented taxa are a number of species of parrotfish (Scaridae), sur- geonfish (Acanthuridae), the spiny puffer (Diodon hys- trix), a porgy (Monotaxis grandoculis), various wrasses (Labridae), triggerfish (Balistidae), snappers (Lutjani- dae), and some small elasmobranchs (either sharks or rays) represented by vertebrae. Some of these species could readily have been taken on the shell fishhooks recovered from Area B (see above), but others are known to shun hooks and would most likely have been taken with spears, nets, or by poisoning (cf. Kirch and Dye 1979). Another 20% of the vertebrate collection consists of marine turtle, mostly Chelonia mydas, but possibly other species as well. In sorting the vertebrate material, only those bones showing unmistakable shape or surface markings characteristic of turtle were assigned to that class; however, nearly all of the "medium vertebrate" category is believed to also consist of turtle bone. Based on the plastron and carapace bone fragments, individual turtles represented in this collection ranged from about 0.3 to 1.0 m in length. While more than 95% of the vertebrate remains consist of fish and marine turtle, a number of other taxa are represented. Area B yielded four bird bones, including a Gallus gallus humerus, a Brown Noddy (Anous stoli- dus) phalanx, and a tibiotarsus of a medium-sized parrot. Also from Area B are two bones of a fruit bat of the family Pteropodidae, about the size of a large Rousettus or very small Pteropus. A large cuscus, possibly the Spotted Cuscus (Phalanger maculatus), which is known from the Bismarck Archipelago (Carter, Hill, and Tate 1945: 26), is represented by a partial humerus from Area B. Human bone fragments are scattered throughout the deposit, along with a number of teeth. Both Areas A and B yielded teeth and postcranial material from por- poise-sized members of the suborder Odontoceti. Prelim- inary identifications indicate that these represent the genus Peponocephala, and possibly also Tursiops and Grampus. Pig (Sus scrofa) material consists of 4 bones. Conspicuously absent, in comparison with other Lapita sites, are any bones of rats, either the common Pacific Rat (Rattus exulans) or other endemic genera of Mel- anesian rats (e.g., Uromys or Melomys). A characteristic feature of virtually all known Lapita sites is the high density of marine molluscs, and the Mussau sites are no exception. All molluscs recovered in the sieves, amounting to more than 0.5 metric ton, were retained for analysis. The densities of molluscan remains from the three sites are summarized in Table 4. Area B of ECA and Site EHB have nearly identical densities, while that of Site ECB is only slightly lower. The density in Area A of ECA, however, is only about half that of Area B and EHB. Given the later age of the Area A deposit, this reduction in molluscan midden density is significant, revealing a trend known from other island subsistence sequences (e.g., Kirch and Yen 1982). A large number of taxa are included in the molluscan remains from a variety of lagoon and reef microenviron- ments. Among the dominant gastropods are Lambis lam- bis, Strombus spp., Cerithium spp., Trochus niloticus, and various species in the families Cypraeidae, Conidae, Mitridae, and Neritidae. Dominant bivalves include Tri- dacna maxima, Hippopus hippopus, Chama spp., Ana- dara antiquata, Gafrarium sp., Pycnodonta hyotis, Cardium sp., and Codakia sp. The Mussau Project and Lapita Prehistory The 1985 Mussau excavations yielded the most exten- sive collections to date of Lapita materials from the Bismarck Archipelago, a region recently hypothesized to be the Lapita "homeland" (Allen 1984; Spriggs 1984). The Mussau materials, however, are not in complete agreement with earlier conclusions on the nature of Bis- marck Lapita assemblages. In particular, Anson's (1983) conclusions regarding an early "far western" Lapita com-</page><page sequence="15">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 14, 1987 177 Table 3.

Many of the differences that Anson identified between the Watom and Eloaua-Ambitle-Talasea clusters may, in fact, reflect sample size errors, as may be seen by the fact that the new and greatly expanded samples from ECA, ECB, and EHB contain many traits that Anson identified as unique to Watom (see Specht 1968). For example, the "broad and rather rectangular" lime- filled, dentate-stamped designs as well as flat-based dec- orated dishes said to be characteristic of Watom are very heavily represented at ECA (cf. Anson 1983: 260). Since Anson's results have been taken as crucial support for the hypothesis of a lengthy, in situ origin of Lapita in the Bismarck Archipelago (Allen 1984; Spriggs 1984), these new results require that we rethink current notions of Lapita origins. While recent excavations on New Ireland have demonstrated the presence of human pop- ulations in the Bismarcks for at least 14,000 years (Downie and White 1979; Specht, Lilley, and Normu 1981; J. Allen, personal communication 1986), Lapita itself still has no clear local antecedent. The Mussau materials cannot be regarded as other than fully-devel- oped, "classic" Lapita. In short, the question of the immediate origins of Lapita-whether from farther to the west, local, or a combination of the two-remains open to further investigation. While the immediate origins of Lapita itself remain enigmatic, the role of Lapita as the founding culture ancestral to most later cultures of eastern Melanesia, Polynesia, and central and eastern Micronesia is increas- ingly certain. Linguistically, all of the modem popula- tions of these areas speak languages of the Eastern Oceanic subgroup of Austronesian (Pawley 1972; Paw- ley and Green 1986), itself strong evidence for common origins. On archaeological grounds, it now appears that the ancestral group can be identified as the Lapita Cul- tural Complex. Certainly, the full range of Lapita ma- terial culture now evidenced from the Mussau sites, along with that from previously-excavated Lapita depos- its, provides an ancestral technocomplex to which the technological repertoires of later Oceanic cultures can be readily traced. The Mussau Lapita people had already mastered the working of obsidian, chert, various vol- canic and metavolcanic stones, ceramic clays, a wide range of shell, coral, and bone to create a highly diverse and sophisticated assemblage of tools, implements, or- naments, and other objects. Further, classic Lapita ce- ramics provide the basal stages for a series of local ceramic traditions throughout eastern Melanesia, western Polynesia, and central Micronesia, all ending in simpli- fied plain wares. The Mussau sites also provide critical new data on Lapita subsistence economy. Analysis of faunal materi- als, as well as the presence of sophisticated fishhooks, indicates the significant role of fishing and marine ex- ploitation in Lapita subsistence. There can be no doubt that the Lapita people possessed an extensive knowledge of tropical Indo-Pacific reefs and lagoons and had de- veloped a diverse set of strategies for fully exploiting the resources of these environments. At the same time, several lines of evidence also point to terrestrial produc- tion. In Mussau, these include the presence of domestic pig (Sus scrofa) and large numbers of peelers and scrap- ers that can only have been used in the preparation of starchy tubers and corms (such as Dioscorea and Colo- casia) or fleshy fruit (such as Artocarpus). Stone imple- ments provisionally identified as nut-cracking hammers are also important in this light. Recent ethnobotanical work in the Bismarcks (Yen 1982, personal communi- cation 1986) points to a lengthy period of plant domes- tication, especially of various fruit and nut-bearing genera. Further, recent evidence of 9000-year-old culti- vation in interior New Guinea (Golson 1982) has prompted a closer look at the New Guinea-Bismarcks</page><page sequence="16">178 Lapita and Oceanic Cultural Originsl/Kirch region as a probable locus of both domestication and agronomic innovation. In my view, the Mussau data suggest a broadly-based Lapita subsistence economy, incorporating sophisticated marine exploitation with tuber-crop horticulture and arboriculture. Certainly such an economy would have aided the rapid expansion of Lapita populations throughout the sw Pacific in the late second millennium B.C. One of the most intriguing aspects of Lapita prehistory is the substantial evidence for wide-ranging and complex long-distance exchange networks, transporting exotic materials (such as obsidian, chert, adzes, temper, clay, finished pots, oven stones, etc.) between Lapita com- munities up to 3400 km distant (Ambrose and Green 1972; Green 1974, 1979). The Mussau sites provide significant new data on such exchange networks. All three sites contain large quantities of obsidian from two separate sources (Lou and Talasea), one 270 km to the west, the other 390 km to the south. Also imported from sources unidentified at present were chert, stone adzes, stone abraders, and a wide variety of volcanic and me- tavolcanic manuports. Preliminary compositional anal- ysis of ceramics also indicates the transport of either finished pots or clay and temper for ceramic manufac- ture. The Mussau sites also yielded an unprecedented array of shell objects such as rings, beads, "pendants," and so forth, with close ethnographic parallels in Mel- anesian exchange valuables. Many of these were being manufactured at the Mussau sites and may then have entered into one or more long-distance exchange loops. Again, it appears that Lapita long-distance exchange may have provided the impetus for many of the later, ethnographically-attested exchange systems of island Oceania, with their characteristic use of shell "money" valuables. The significance of long-distance exchange for the overall strategy of Lapita dispersal and colonization should not be overestimated. Once Lapita populations left the Bismarcks and began actively expanding up to 4500 km eastward into the Pacific, they encountered previously-unoccupied and, more importantly, bioti- cally-impoverished islands. While the coastal marine re- sources of such previously-unexploited islands would have been rich, terrestrial resources would not have been (Kirch 1984). Further, many of the Lapita popagules (founding populations) may have been small groups barely on the threshold of demographic stability and easily susceptible to extinction (McArthur, Saunders, and Tweedie 1976; Richter-Dyn and Goel 1972). In such circumstances, high survival value might be conferred by the maintenance of contacts westward back to home- land communities. Such contacts would provide a source of biotic materials (planting stocks) to extend or replen- ish agricultural systems, new technologies, and demo- graphically-essential marriage partners, in addition to such prestige-goods as obsidian. Yet such contacts also had to be maintained at risk, for they involved open-sea voyages of considerable distance. A formal exchange system centering on the status- enhancing acquisition of prestige goods (e.g., shell valu- ables, high-quality obsidian) may have been the social mechanism maintaining what was in effect an essential component of the Lapita dispersal and colonization strat- egy. This hypothesis, furthermore, offers an explanation for the later retraction and decline of the widespread Lapita exchange network. Once Lapita communities be- came firmly established (both economically and demo- graphically) in eastern Melanesia and Polynesia, the adaptive value of the system would cease. The "social inertia" of prestige-good exchange might carry the sys- tem for awhile, but in time the costs of long-distance voyaging (including loss of canoes and lives) would probably come to outweigh any purely social gains. Finally, the 1985 Mussau excavations have begun to provide some information on what happened to Lapita communities in the Bismarck Archipelago after about 500 B.C. The ECA Area A plain-ware assemblage sug- gests local simplification of ceramic technology, such as is known to have occurred as well with Lapita assem- blages in western Polynesia (Kirch 1978, 1981). Ceram- ics were unknown in Mussau at European contact (Nevermann 1933), but the timing of their cessation in Mussau remains unknown. Several large aceramic mid- den sites were discovered during the 1985 survey, and excavations in these deposits (planned for late 1986) may well provide the answer to this question. We suspect that once a complete prehistoric sequence for the Mussau group has been delineated, a continuous sequence of cultural change bridging Lapita and the "ethnographic present" will be evident; this is a major task for future investigation.
