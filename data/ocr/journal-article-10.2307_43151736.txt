<plain_text><page sequence="1">How to avoid becoming a middle-aged fogey, with reference to three recent popular French films It is virtually a truism that the most recent French cinema has been much less interesting to the theorist than at any time since before the advent of the nouvelle vague at the end of the 1950s. This is largely - to use a term whose theoretical status is (symptomatically?) unclear - a generational phenomenon. The 'generation(s) of theory' formed in the 1960s and 1970s have in less than a decade been faced with the death (Truffaut), effective retirement (Bresson), and increasing unavailability in England at least (Chabrol, Resnais, Rivette)1 of many of the leading directors of that period, along with the effacement of cinematic grand theory as evidenced in the work of such as Jean-Louis Comolli or Christian Metz. Godard's evolution through the 1980s - from the return to 'mainstream' though none the less innovative and politically committed cinema with Sauve qui peut (la vie ) to what many regarded as the fiasco of King Lear and the failure of two of his three most recent films, Soigne ta droite and Nouvelle vague , to find a British distributor - is perhaps the most eloquent distillation of the watershed that this period has represented alike for the nouvelle vague and its contemporaries and for film theory. Recent developments in French film production are likely to leave the generation in question feeling doubly outflanked, by its elders and its juniors. On the one hand, the mid and late eighties saw a resurgence of the big-screen literary adaptation once so execrated by the nouvelle vague , as instanced by Jean de Florette , Manon des Sources (both Pagnol adaptations directed by Claude Berri), and Cyrano de Bergerac (the Rostand play filmed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau). On the other, there has been the upsurge of what has been dubbed the 'Forum des Halles' style - determinedly non-realistic film-making influenced by the video-clip and the style of Parisian street punk (Jean-Jacques Beineix, Luc Besson and Léos Carax are the key directors here). The latter tendency, while it has often been called 'post-modern', has neither laid claim to nor generated anything that might be described as a major theoretical discourse of its own,2 so that the sense of generational outflanking referred to is likely to be intensified by a feeling of theoretical bereavement. A sour retreat into middle-aged fogey dom is the obvious temptation. Paragraph Volume 15 © Oxford University Press 1992</page><page sequence="2">98 Paragraph I should like to try here to suggest a way of avoiding this, calling in aid the increased emphasis given to historical and contextual factors in recent French writing on the cinema (such as that of Jean-Pierre Jeancolas or Pierre Sorlin). This is to take three of the most popular French films of the late 1980s, all much less successful in Britain than across the Channel, and to suggest reasons, textual and contextual, for their popularity in France. Theory and ideology alike may be in a period of exhaustion, but the politics of culture have been a major issue, going far beyond academic circles, in Mitterrand's France. The breadth of support given to him by artists and intellectuals, the powerful personality and wide-ranging cultural initiatives of Jack Lang, the increasing prominence of Francophone Arab culture, the debates surrounding the grandiose Parisian architectural manifestations of the late 1980s all combine to ensure that the 'Mitterrand generation' is a cultural phenomenon as much as, if not more than, a specifically political one. The films I have chosen are, in chronological order: La Vie est un long fleuve tranquille ( Life is a long calm river), directed by Étienne Chatiliez (1988 - production budget 15 million francs); Le grand bleu ( The Big Blue), directed by Luc Besson (198 8 -production budget 78 million francs); and Camille Claudel , directed by Bruno Nuytten (1989- production budget 96 million francs). These were respectively the sixth, second, and eighth most successful films in France in 1988-9, 3 and the only other French films to finish higher were Annaud's L'Ours { The Bear) (first) and Lelouch's Itinéraire d'un enfant gâté {Journey of a spoilt child) (seventh), so that they can be regarded as symptomatic films of their time - the period of the end of Mitterrand's 'cohabitation' with Chirac's right-wing government and the beginning of consensual ouverture from the Socialist government of Rocard. Besson had previously directed two features {Le Dernier Combat {The Last Battle) and Subway), and Le grand bleu received its first screening at the Cannes Festival amid a carefully-fostered climate of secrecy. Chatiliez and Nuytten were making their feature débuts. Chatiliez was France's premier director of advertising commercials, despite which he had difficulty in raising the comparatively small sum he required. Nuytten is one of the leading French cameramen, and the former lover of Isabelle Adjani, who coproduced the film amid allegations of abusing her influence as president of the Commission des Avances sur Recettes, the body that allocates production loans to French film-makers. Le grand bleu and Camille Claudel were thus predestined successes, whereas the popularity of La Vie est un long fleuve tranquille took everybody by surprise. The film tells of two familles nombreuses in</page><page sequence="3">How to avoid becoming a middle-aged fogey 99 Northern France, one from the respectable Catholic bourgeoisie, the other plebeian rather than proletarian, living off more or less illicit activities, who are brought together when a nurse reveals that in a fit of pique against her selfish gynaecologist lover she had exchanged two children at birth. The wealthy family (the Le Quesnoys) 'buy' their rightful offspring Maurice from the all-too-eager Groseilles (literally 'gooseberries' . . .). Maurice thenceforth lives with the Le Quesnoys but pays regular visits to the Groseilles, periodically helping himself to silver and other delights from his 'new' home. One of the last shots of the film shows him trudging, 'between families', down a street of working-class houses at dusk. Bernadette, the daughter with whom he was exchanged, and who remains with the Le Quesnoys, undergoes a severe depression, while one of the Le Quesnoy boys is sexually initiated by a Groseille daughter and the two sets of offspring drink and sniff glue together. A family romance, obviously, or even a neo-realist fairy tale, and one that owed much of its impact to the fact that it was released not long before the 1988 Presidential elections. The weekly magazine L'Événement du jeudi (10-16 March 1988) spoke of it as 'the film of the Mitterrand generation' - the latter a slogan used during the Presidential elections. Mitterrand presented himself at these elections as a unifying, conciliatory figure (the name of the Socialist Party did not even appear on his posters), and the appeal to a 'generation' that had grown up under his presidency and its civilizing values, rather than to more contentious categories such as social class, clearly illustrates this. It is not insignificant that the best- selling book published, in two volumes, to mark the twentieth anniversary of May 1968, and shortly thereafter made into a successful series of television programmes, bore the title Génération, by Hervé Hamon and Patrick Rotman - emblematic of the reduction of social conflict to an ill-defined generational consensus, and perhaps beyond that of the tendency to collapse the ideological into the cultural. The Le Quesnoy /Groseille younger generations get along well enough, though emphatically not (as with Maurice's kleptomania and Bernadette's depression) in such a way as to suggest that goodwill among the young can transcend class differences. The problem of racism - often adduced after the success of the Touche pas à mon pote campaign as the issue on which the Mitterrand generation felt most strongly - is much more coyly treated. The car explosion outside the Arab grocer's which opens the film seems at first to be a racial attack, but later turns out to be a Groseille ruse for collecting insurance money; and the racist remarks that the Groseille father (invalided out of the Algerian war) in particular makes to him are constantly recuperated by their context, for the family are</page><page sequence="4">100 Paragraph the shop's best customers and Maurice is a friend of the grocer's. Nor do any of the Groseilles deal in drugs, which their real-life equivalents might well do. Racism and fear of drugs are two key weapons in Jean-Marie Le Pen's armoury, and the May 1968 activist (now a Socialist Party town-planning consultant) Roland Castro claimed in an issue of the journal 7 à Varis that the Groseilles would probably be Le Pen voters and represented the kind of electorate on which the Left should work. Chatiliez himself, however, is quoted in Le Nouvel Observateur (25-31 March 1988) as saying that the Groseilles would not trouble to vote ('C'est comme moi. Ils me font chier. C'est rien que des cons de merde') ('They're like me. They [i.e. politicians] piss me off. They're just shitty bastards'). Castro also appears to have got it wrong concerning the Le Quesnoys. He sees them as typical of the traditional right-wing vote that in 1988 would have been torn between Barre, Chirac and Mitterrand, whose supporters he defines as a 'grand choeur, hétéroclite politiquement, mais homogène moralement' (a great chorus, politically ¿eteroclite but morally homogeneous). Chatiliez, however, sees the Le Quesnoys as clear-cut Barre supporters. This kind of indirect altercation over the political sympathies of fictional characters may appear ludicrous, though it is also in some ways reminiscent of the sixties and seventies debates over the television comedy character Alf Garnett in Till Death Us Do Part and how far his popularity might have been due to sympathy with rather than mockery of the racist attitudes he grotesquely articulated. I believe, however, that it says a great deal about the political state of France in 1988 and since. The massive re-emergence of consensus and the blunting or exhaustion of ideological confrontation have led to an emphasis on moral campaigns and single- issue politics along with a general disillusionment with professional politicians. It is significant here that Chatiliez chose to represent, in a non-threatening way, a family of drop-outs and petty criminals rather than a working-class family, for the latter would have introduced too serious a political dimension into a film that 'n'a servi qu'à faire rire' (was only there to make people laugh) (interview with Florence Quentin, the film's scriptwriter and executive producer, in L'Humanité of 9 March 1988). The political dimension is nevertheless there in the very absence of politics, an absence at once filled and reinforced by the debates and speculations that surrounded the film on its release. I have chosen to include Le grand bleu because it seems to me one of the most sinister of contemporary French films. It tells the story of two free-divers whose childhood friendship, founded on their rivalry,</page><page sequence="5">How to avoid becoming a middle-aged fogey 101 survives their love for the same woman (played by Rosanna Arquette). When one (Enzo) dies attempting to break the record, the other (Jacques) abandons the pregnant Arquette to plunge to the bottom of the ocean and die in his turn. The film's final shot depicts him floating blissfully off in the embrace of one of the dolphins he has loved to the point of desiring to become one of them. The kitsch ecological religiosity in which the entire film is bathed is epitomized in a remark made by one of the divers: 'Dieu est au fond de la mer, je plonge pour aller le retrouver' (God is at the bottom of the sea; I'm diving to find him.) When I saw the film, I was startled to see outside the cinema reproductions of letters from fans of the film, like so many Catholic ex votos. Paris-Match commented on the film's success: 'L'absolu n'est plus au fond de l'Espace, ni dans la pensée de Mao: il loge désormais dans l'azur, au sommet des montagnes, ou à cent mètres en dessous du niveau de la mer.' (The absolute is no longer in the depths of space, nor in the thoughts of Chairman Mao: from now on it is in the blue, at the top of a mountain, or 100 metres below sea-level). Commercially-packaged hunger for transcendence has often had a ready market in France since the short-lived phenomenon of the 'new philosophers' back in the late 1970s.4 If politics is only sublimated sex, and sex is only sublimated sublimity, then what can be more sublime than to transcend politics and sex towards transcendent sublimity itself? Besson threw himself into the cult surrounding the film with relish, producing a longer version (three hours instead of two and a quarter) which he offered to the thirteen towns where the first version had recorded more than 100 000 ticket-sales. This version was premiered at the largest cinema in Paris, equipped with the biggest screen in the world - Le Grand Rex, on one of the main boulevards. Some people saw this version as many as forty-one times; one flew specially from Zurich to see it; the scent of sea-air was pumped into the cinema before the start, the credit- sequences were applauded, and the majority of the audience knew the film more or less off by heart. The Rocky Horror Picture Show many years ago established a similar cult at a cinema in Greenwich Village, but one much more ironically self-aware. Le grand bleu' s depiction of a world without violence, (almost) without sex, with a rivalry that takes its two opponents to a death in which they love each other seems to be taken by its audience as, literally, gospel. The Italian diver on whom Enzo in the film is supposedly based sued Besson for depicting him as a 'Mafioso bandit' in his 'nationalistic and chauvinistic film', according to Le Nouvel Observateur, and his was not the only voice to register dissent. L'Humanité described the film as that of</page><page sequence="6">102 Paragraph a generation 'qui croit que l'image est une fin en soi' (which believes that the image is an end in itself), a perception echoed in Le Point of 8 August 1988 when it speaks of the 'naufrage du langage' (shipwreck of language). The same journal, not without reservations, had earlier given the film three stars (its maximum), describing it as 'le film emblématique des années 80; l'époque de la victoire des images sur la parole, de la fascination sur la réflexion' (the emblematic film of the 80s, the period of the triumph of images over words, of fascination over reflection). The film's anti- intellectualism, reinforced in Besson's variously vacuous utterances about it, is I hope clear enough from what I have said about it. It is ironic that such a work should be perceived as the supreme filmic text of the generation of that supposed arch-intellectual François Mitterrand, but Mitterrands own image at the time the film came out was that of a benignly consensual Tonton (Uncle) rather than a combative socialist, which may suggest limitations to such a view of him, as well as pointing to the blunting of ideological conflict characteristic of the period. One of the most obnoxious things about Le grand bleu is the manner in which it summons up concerned and/ or intellectual discourses around its crassly anti-intellectual self. Thus, the film's misogyny is condoned by France Soir with the remark (pitying? condemnatory?) that 'l'homme ambitieux est toujours misogyne' (the ambitious man is always a misogynist). Even Paris Match, a weekly magazine mostly read by those with few intellectual titles or pretensions, evokes Lacan and Freud in its piece ( apropos the drowning of Jacques's father in the film's opening sequence), and drafts in a tame psychoanalyst to compare the film's voyage into the deep to the experience of a so-called hard drug user ('Là aussi, on plonge' (There too, one takes a trip)). A concentric constellation of anxieties - sexual, narcotic, verbal, environmental - finds in and around Le grand bleu a place both to articulate and to annul itself. What, after all, are the film's dolphins but benignly anthropomorphic variations on the theme of Jaws - 'good castrators' for those late 1980s that asked for no better than to have their ideological testicles chewed off with painless (and preferably presidential) teeth? Finally, Camille Claudel , which was France's most successful biopic for some considerable time, notable as much for the controversies around it as in its own right. The story of the sculptress's breakdown after the ending of her relationship with Rodin, and her incarceration (at the insistence of her writer brother Paul) for the last thirty years of her life, had already aroused interest in France through the publication of two biographies - one, savagely critical of the Claudel family, by Anne Delbée, which sold a million copies, the other by Reine-Marie Paris.</page><page sequence="7">How to avoid becoming a middle-aged fogey 103 Three films on Camille Claudel's life were planned at one stage - one to be directed by Chabrol, starring Isabelle Huppert; one by Anne Delbée, with Philippe Noiret in the role of Rodin; and the Nuytten/ Adjani project. That only the latter was actually made was in large part due to the hostility of the Claudel family, who blocked access to family letters and documents for the other film-makers and effectively allowed Adjani to buy sole rights for (one version of) the story. It would be difficult to imagine a more currently unfashionable literary figure than the flamboyantly right-wing Catholic Paul Claudel, which is probably why what were widely seen as attempts to hush up his treatment of his sister - attempts with which Adjani was regarded as complicit - met with little or no sympathy. Adjani/Camille - a name evocation of Garbo's consumptive heroine maudite - became an icon in a culture in which feminism is often perceived as obsolescent, its programmatic demands felt to have been largely met and its conceptual developments seen as overtaken by the wider 'crisis of theory'. Two contextual factors reinforced this perception: one, Adjani's revelation that her father had been Algerian and her mother German; the other, the extraordinary rumour (whose origin neither I nor anybody else I know has been able to trace) that Adjani was dying of Aids at the time she made the film. The first of these earned the unfortunate superstar a love-letter' from Philippe Sollers, published in Le Point on 28 November 1988, in which he speaks of her as uniting France's two major opponents in war but fulsomely observes: 'Vous êtes toujours la plus belle, aucune inquiétude à avoir' (You are still the most beautiful, there is no need to worry). What is interesting here is the convergence on Adjani-as-star of perhaps the two major anxieties on which Le Pen plays. His views on miscegenation need no repeating here, and he has on French television advocated the social segregation of people with Aids, though subsequently claiming to 'regret' this. Talk of a 'national psyche' is unsound if not downright dangerous, but were one to exist in the France of 1988/1989 it would clearly have found in Isabelle Adjani/ Camille Claudel the perfect conduit for its preoccupations. Camille Claudel is easier to categorize politically than the other two films I have discussed, for Adjani's visit to Algiers to support student demands for greater democracy and Gérard Depardieu's much-publicized admiration and support for Mitterrand (the only politician for whom he has ever voted) place both stars, and with them in many respects the film, on what might be described as the attenuated Left that is today hegemonic in France. It has to be said, tedious though I find the film, that it has brought a real-life oppressed woman to public prominence as no</page><page sequence="8">104 Paragraph other French film I can think of has done before. It can only be regretted that alternative, more culturally disruptive versions of her story have been legally thwarted. What of a conclusion? The most I would wish to offer is that all three films speak to similar anxieties, most notably racial and sexual - anxieties about parenthood and class in La Vie est un long fleuve tranquille, about men's relationship to women in Le grand bleu (which is among other things a classic buddy movie), about miscenegation, Aids and madness in (the on and off screen) Camille Claudel. Chatiliez's discomfiting of the haute bourgeoisie , Besson's genuflection to an at once feeble and menacing variant of 'deep ecology', Nuytten's promotion of a kind of post-feminism seem to me in differing degrees symptomatic of the ideological and political watering-down of French society as of the progress that society has undoubtedly realised in the past decade. Cinema speaks, not only to and of a culture's hopes, but also to and of its fears. Keith A Reader Kingston Polytechnic NOTES 1 Chabrol's Une Affaire de Femmes , despite starring Isabelle Huppert and enjoying great success in France and the USA, has never been shown in Britain, and his most recent film at the time of writing, Dr M, was in distribution for only a very short time. Nothing by Rivette has been distributed in Britain since L'Amour par Terre in 1984, and Resnais's last feature, I Want to Go Home (scripted by Jules Feiffer and starring Gérard Depardieu . . .), was his first not to secure British distribution. 2 Though an indication of what such a discourse might look like is provided by David Russell's 'Two or Three Things We Know About Beineix', Sight and Sound (winter 1989-90), 42-47. 3 Source: CNC Info.
