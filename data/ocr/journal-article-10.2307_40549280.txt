<plain_text><page sequence="1">Speaking/Listening BY DANIEL HARRIS I. Speaking When I was twelve or thirteen, my family moved from Wisconsin to the very heart of Appalachia where men with corn-cob pipes, sawed-off shot guns, and coon caps, as my adolescent imagination chose to misrep- resent them, spoke a Southern brogue so thick and cacophonous that my sisters and I were hard-pressed to understand the simplest greetings or the most matter-of-fact requests. I looked down on the incomprehensible drawl of these toothless hayseeds and resolved never to acquire their accent, a decision I put into effect by making a tape of all the vowels sounds and a handful of key phrases of The-Rain-In-Spain-Falls-Mainly-On-The- Plain variety which I repeated in order to keep my voice free of the unmusical taint of the hillbilly. When other teenagers were listening to pop music, to the Monkeys and Mama Cass, I was listening to recordings of my own voice during a series of self-imposed language labs, remedial drills in which, perhaps for the last time in my entire life, I was able to hear myself without cringing, without shuddering at my stilted phraseology and prematurely aged stateliness. The result of this self-administered speech therapy has been an entirely manufactured style of delivery, a fake patrician voice that many people, much to my embarrassment, have mistaken for a British accent but</page><page sequence="2">232 DANIEL HARRIS that in fact derives from Hollywood, from the back lots of MGM, from years and years of watching re-runs. As a self-conscious fop who associated the Appalachian twang with ignorance and, more important, with the hatred of homosexuals, I created an ultra-sophisticated, if imagi- nary, set of peers, free of prejudices, by speaking in the high-falutin manner of Grace Kelly and Norma Sheer whose studied graciousness and aristocratic bearing helped me eradicate all traces of the region in which I lived. In imitation of the faux Brits in classic American cinema, where members of the upper classes often seem to have come straight from the soccer fields of Eton, no matter how many years they lived in Bensonhurst and the Bronx, I began to over-articulate shamelessly, dotting every i, crossing every t, and pronouncing every consonant so that, to this day, the words I use seem to have several more syllables than in fact they do. While it is as difficult to change one's voice as it is to change one's handwriting, I have tried conscientiously to suppress the sound of my pretentiousness but not without creating further distortions in my speech. I pour on the plain American accent so thickly that at times my voice cracks like a pubescent boy's, the mellifluous intonations of the elegant gay man giving way to the abrupt, hard-boiled delivery of a character out of a Raymond Chandler novel. My own worst critic, I deflate myself at every turn by speaking in an artificially brusque manner and by littering my speech with profanities that lose their vituperative power when they are tossed off with the same degree of self-conscious precision I use when discussing Quattrocento painting or the tortuous style of the late Henry James. I am a peculiarly ineffective swearer because I curse according to an agenda, that of the self-saboteur who, in an effort to sound less affected, to get down with the boyz in the hood, punctures his grandiloquent airs by showering his audience with scatological and sacrilegious epithets. I never drop the "g" in "fucking," allow the "of to become "uv" in "sonuvabitch," elide the "r"'s in "motherfucker" to form the colorfully thuggish "mothafucka," or say "faggit" like a genuine gay basher, but instead curse like an elocutionist who lambastes his enemies as if he were regaling them with a poem at a literary recital. My primary reason for swearing is not to express anger but to sully my own image, to throw mud pies in the mirror, to sound more proletarian, more streetwise, as if I had never been to Harvard or written four books or lectured on</page><page sequence="3">Speaking/Listening 233 college campuses, as if I were a drunken sailor rather than just a gutter- mouthed intellectual trying hopelessly to talk tough, to prove to others that, his insufferable pomposity notwithstanding, he has cracked as many dirty jokes in as many locker rooms as the next guy. But although I pepper my conversation with obscenities, my middle-class upbringing emerges in one of my characteristic expressions, "whoopsy," an annoyingly flaccid expletive that I use when, in the presence of others, I make a mistake or damage someone else's property. "Whoopsy" is not a curse but an apology, a self-exculpating word that I utter out of guilt, not rage, attempting to endear myself to the owner of the fountain pen I've just broken or the wine goblet I've just smashed, adopting the inappropriately youthful jargon of a bobby-soxer from the 1950s. When we make a mistake in front of a witness who might, with good reason, find fault with our ham-handedness, we automatically infantilize ourselves in an obsequious effort to make light of the situation, uttering the wide-eyed exclamation of a choir boy or a cheer leader. By slipping into a style that is both puerile and anachronistic when I drop something or snap it in two, I forestall the criticisms of the peevish lawyer whose brief I accidentally erased or the friend whose sofa I stained with a large splotch of Burgundy wine, for how can any civilized person in good conscience censure a trembling teenager who shuffles his feet, lowers his eyes, and mutters such things as "golly," "gee whiz," and "whoopsy"? But if I damage something and there are no witnesses, especially if I damage something of my own, I drop the teenybopper routine and let fly with "damnitalltohellgoddamnit." When we are alone, we have no reason to wriggle out of guilt or appease our critics and hence we do not address them at all but rather direct our aggression towards the inaminate thing itself, much as people kick the doors on which they have stubbed their toes or slam down phones that have just delivered bad news, thereby killing the messenger. Rather than accepting my responsibility for the disaster, apologizing profusely for my clumsiness, or turning myself into a childish innocent, I scold the jammed stapler or the shattered vase. I administer corporal punishment and engage in a nonsensical form of anthropomorphism in which I cast myself as the victim not the perpetrator, the blameless dupe of that willful teacup or that disobedient CD player which I reprimand for its awkwardness, its incompetence. Accidents thus</page><page sequence="4">234 DANIEL HARRIS elicit two linguistic responses from me, one for when I feel I must propitiate angry bystanders by adopting a somewhat simpering, adoles- cent manner and one for when there is no one in the room to hear me viciously attack the naughty, intractable objects I scream at like a frenzied child-beater brandishing a wire coat hanger. My delivery is so unspontaneous not only because of my dislike of the Appalachian accent and my subsequent attempts to modify my supercilious manner but also because of my profession, which, even as I have become more prolix on paper, has made me more stammering as a speaker. I apply to conversation literary standards derived from prose, rules of correctness and elegance that are inapplicable to the hasty improvisations of everyday speech which one cannot redraft, edit on a word processor, and reprint, blackening the page with deletions and insertions. I am, for instance, a studied connoisseur of the mot juste which I never light on effortlessly, as if by chance, but ferret out only by combing through my internal Thesaurus where I fall into a morass of alternatives that leads me to stutter, to repeat definite and indefinite articles as many as four or five times as I hesitate over the various choices that come to mind: "the . . .the . . .the . . .the . . .silken tresses of the . . .the . . .the . . .vixen's head," "that . . . that . . . grotesque eyesore affixed to that . . . that . that . . . monstrosity of a building," or ua ... a ... a ... mantra, a chant, of encouragement." Unlike those who suffer from real psychological speech impediments, a handicap that makes them trip over the initial consonants of words, sputtering out alliterative volleys of plosives, dentals, and dipthongs, I suffer from a literary speech impediment which forces me to repeat the articles of nouns that are never on the tip of my tongue, delightfully serendipitous, but that I must summon out of the abyss like a frustrated conjurer of elusive spirits. My ceaseless endeavors to track down the perfect word has actually increased my incoherence rather than making me the suave rhetorician I aspire to be, the silver-tongued orator who unfailingly selects the most felicitous expression. In fact, more often than not, I choose the mot injuste. I am plagued by malapropisms which come from trying too hard, from aiming well above my intellectual station, as when I tell my boyfriend that his unenthusiastic response to my "how are you?" was not very "authorita- tive," i.e., "convincing"; when I describe a frigid, neoclassical painting as</page><page sequence="5">Speaking/Listening 235 too "regulated," i.e., "linear"; or when I speak of a woman whose makeup was "meretricious," i.e., "excessive." What's more, I cannot restrain my frequent flights of fancy, the florid and consistently inexact metaphors and similes that only the most gifted speaker (or the most improvident) would have the audacity to utter out loud. Pointing to a swathe of scarlet fabric that I have draped down a descending tier of bookshelves, I explained to a friend that it is "quite a papal Niagara Falls," a figure of speech as purple as one I used to describe a recent visit to Macy's in which I found myself in the men's underwear department where I was confronted by "a vast horizon, a stretching vista, of dazzlingly white briefs." In my efforts to achieve eloquence, I fly very high and, like Icarus, fall very low. I experiment with the spoken word precisely as I experiment with my writing, the difference being that, with one' s extemporaneous, off-the-cuff remarks, one does not have the opportunity to shape metaphors into concise, economical comparisons but instead creates sprawling conceits that are disconcertingly inapposite and that strike the listener as self- indulgent and entirely out-of-place within the unpoetic context of most conversations. It is a truism of contemporary creative writing classes that our prose reflects our real voices, but in my case, the opposite is true: talking is only an inferior, poorly written form of my writing. Prose is not speech in slow motion - speech is writing speeded up, played at a dizzyingly accelerated pace that shows all of the old drafts, the illegible mass of editorial scribbles that authors hide from their readers, maintain- ing the pretense that their prose flows from their pens and pencils without a single blot or erasure. Writers have a unique perspective on language that makes them extremely unforgiving when they are forced to listen to their own conversation, which never measures up to the idealized world of the page. This Utopian realm is a prose poet's Shrangi-La in which one always finds the right adjective, in which one can risk metaphors without falling flat on one's face, in which one's sentences have beginnings, middles, and ends and don't straggle off into blathering, inconclusive nonsense, and in which all of one's false starts, one's errors of judgment and taste, are read only by that most discreet and supportive of critics, the waste basket. I falter over my words like a dazed amnesiac who has forgotten his own name not only because I bring a distinctly belletristic sensibility to the mundane chit-chat of my interactions with store clerks and bus</page><page sequence="6">236 DANIEL HARRIS drivers but because I simply cannot master the extensive vocabulary necessary for modern life, from the "motherboards," microchips, and "servomechanisms" in our PCs to the platelets, lympocytes, and isoanti- bodies in our blood. I am therefore constantly resorting to a generic noun, a word that functions as an invitation to my listeners to fill in the blank: the empty cipher "thing," as in "I left the . . .the thing on the coffee table," i.e., the channel changer; "bring me the ... thing," i.e., the chicken mallet; or "could you move that thing closer to the other thing?," i.e., the toaster to the electrical outlet. Unable to remember the simplest words, I frequently resort to Twenty Questions in which I enlist my friends in the task of helping me to guess what I'm thinking of, an anxious game of mind- reading in which I become a helplessly animated charadist who is forced to sculpt spheres and boxes in the air, forms that usually baffle my listeners, who stare dumbfounded as I attempt to find such recherché words as "refrigerator," "battery," and "light bulb." The material complexity of our lives and our growing number of possessions pose an enormous epistemo- logical and linguistic challenge that is increasingly leaving us at a loss for words, forcing us to revert to a prelinguistic form of communication. Both the absence of nouns in the lives of the earliest Homo Sapiens and their superabundance in the lives of contemporary city dwellers have the same consequence, a troubling new ineloquence that we are now overcoming by using sign language, devolving to a primitive system of speechless gestures, pointing and gesticulating in order to conjure up the word "microwave," "laptop," or "halogen lamp." Not only are there too many things in my world, there are too many people: movie stars, politicians, third-rate hosts of game shows, defrocked Southern ministers, drug-addicted supermodels - a madding crowd of celebrities whom I can never identify, handicapped as I am by a pathological name block, a shortcoming that, at its worst, has prevented me from remembering the names of my own mother and boyfriend. This shortcoming is so severe that I am frequently trapped in a double or even triple bind, a vicious linguistic circle in which I try to jog my failing memory by calling up the name of someone related to "that guy with the big nose who's dating what's her name, the star ofthat show everyone's watching, what's it called?"; or "that televelangist formerly married to the other one, that dragon lady who wears all ofthat eye liner that trickles down</page><page sequence="7">Speaking/Listening 237 her cheeks when she cries on cue." A source of continual humiliation and a huge waste of time and mental energy, my block is an occupational deformity that derives in part from my lack of public contact, from my dislike of collective living, an insularity that has never required me to develop a knack for names, which slip through my fingers like water. My world is eerily free of proper nouns, populated by undesignated faces, dim shades who flit in and out of my life with every new box-office hit, runaway New York Times bestseller, and top-40 song by the latest flash- in-the-pan. My name block also reflects the explosive development of popular culture which has placed unprecedented strains on the human memory by exposing us to more people than we have ever known in the history of the species, the drunk, yo-yo-dieting adulterers of scandal sheets, late-night talk shows, and teenage fanzines, an entire class of insignificant luminaries that has increased the dramatis personae of our lives tenfold. If my over-taxed memory has contributed to my faltering style, so has my conscious decision to reduce such filler as "like," "urn," "man," "dude," "kewl," and "you know what I'm saying" - conversational inani- ties that now constitute the better part of the speech of a generation eager to express tribal unity through a lingua franca of hip colloquialisms. In addition to strengthening fealty to the pack, filler helps the inarticulate project equanimity, the illusion of a strong, poised self that prattles on inexorably, forming a seamless web of sound, unlike more precise speak- ers who appear diffident and uncertain because they refuse to pad their sentences with such faddish interjections as "whatever," "and I'm like," "gross," and "PHAT." Riddled with gaps, my own speech is relatively free of the familiar iterations that others use to gloss over awkward pauses. Filler acts as a non-semantic link between words and has thus become important to the way we present ourselves to others, conveying the false impression of fluidity, of seamless, unhesitating fearlessness. Deprived of the cushion of filler, my subjects and verbs are separated by fissures of silence, agonizing lulls that denote faint-heartedness and lack of confi- dence, whereas volubility, a rush of words spoken with the infallibly rising intonations of the young and sandwiched between "like," "you know," and "I mean," suggests presence of mind. Becoming a more cautious speaker has also made me a less garrulous and hence a less impressive speaker, a</page><page sequence="8">238 DANIEL HARRIS linguistic miser who exercises such severe economy that I often have nothing whatsoever to say. The proverbial angels responsible for the unnerving fitfulness of conversation not only pass overhead in my case, they circle like vultures. But while I have weeded out much of the filler from my speech, by no means have I eliminated it altogether, mainly because it reflects deep-seated anxieties that I share with the rest of my society, as in the case of the expression "I mean": "I was exhausted by the end; I mean, I was bored out of my fucking gourd, it was so dull. He maundered on for over an hour. I mean, really! What was he thinking?" Like most people, I am always acting as a self-commentator, a self-explicating MC who narrates his own speech even as he talks, checking to see if he has made himself clear, if he has "connected," if such conceptually crude statements as "it took forever; I mean, the traffic was awful" or "the weather is unbearable; I mean, I am dying from the heat" have been fully understood. This obsessive act of self-elucidation, performed even when we state the obvious, is grounded in our profound doubts that communication has indeed occurred, that we have reached listeners who seem separated from us by an abyss of potential misapprehensions. The result is an almost neurotic tendency to paraphrase, to footnote our platitudes, as if our conversation were so esoteric that we must function as our own cry tographer, a virtually simultaneous translator who expounds on the most transparent commonplaces. The question "you know?" also serves to ensure that we have clarified our positions by constantly eliciting from our audience verbal confirmation that we are thinking along the same lines and that nothing we have said is out of bounds or contrary to reason. When I talk, I frequently defer in passing to a body of common knowledge. Dispersing "you knows" at every turn, I posit the existence of shared experiences so universal that their truth can be taken for granted, since everything we utter is, as we ourselves make clear, already "known," instantaneously recog- nized by our peers, whom we transform into our mirror image, our doppelgangers. The repetition of this fraternal expression fosters the illusion of identity between the speaker and the listener who are immersed in a placidly homogeneous culture, whereas in fact we live in an increas- ingly diverse and fractured society in which we can never be certain if our</page><page sequence="9">Speaking/Listening 239 audience does indeed "know'* the truth of what we have spoken. "You know" ultimately becomes a command not an inquiry, an official promul- gation that tries to legislate conformity linguistically by broadcasting the subliminal message "you are like me, you know what I know," thus inventing with words a unanimity that simply does not exist. An instru- ment of homogenization rather than a confirmation of real social harmony, the litany of "you knows" scattered throughout our speech expresses a peculiarly modern form of paranoia, a fear that we are talking, not with our spitting image, with acquiescent replicas of ourselves who speak with a single voice, but with perfect strangers. My eagerness to ignore the yawning divisions of sensibility in our society also emerges in the bald statements I habitually make of my likes and dislikes, aesthetic decrees that I utter ex cathedra about novels, movies, music, and public figures, as in "I loved Byatt's Possession, just loved it," "I, I just love Kinsey, love everything about him," and "I hated Los Angeles when I was there, loathed it." As abrupt and categoric as they are, such incontrovertible declarations are actually ways of giving and receiving conversational hugs, of establishing intimacy with others by identifying shared tastes, which become rallying cries that bring us together, uniting us as part of a close-knit clan that adores or despises the same pop musicians and movie stars. Similarly, I am dismayed when my restless efforts to find areas of agreement backfire and I realize that my interlocutor abhors Possession, detests Kinsey, and has the fondest memo- ries of Los Angeles, a dilemma that brings home to me the alienating realities of social disharmony, of the exasperating pluralism of a world that, despite the Pledge of Allegiance, is not indivisible, not univocal, but, rather, atomized into conflicting factions. In a democracy that promises that all men are created equal and that the differences between us are only marginally important, discrepan- cies of taste are a major source of embarrassment, providing tangible evidence that a rigid hierarchy of the classes remains in place, in tact, alive and well, even though we adamantly deny it. Before the rise of represen- tative government, people took for granted that members of the various classes looked, talked, danced, ate, and decorated their houses in radically different ways but, now that we perceive this heterogeneity as a sign of an oppressive caste system, as treason to a fair and equitable state, we have</page><page sequence="10">240 DANIEL HARRIS become morbidly ashamed of it and pretend that conspicuous distinctions between the proletariat and the aristocracy vanished with the French Revolution. The result of this humiliation is that, when we find areas in which our tastes are in agreement, we feel an exhilarating sense of togetherness and temporarily block out of our minds the lack of social uniformity, the divisiveness, that we view as a sign of the failure of egalitarianism. I am therefore always staging moments of reconciliation by throwing down the gauntlet of my tastes in hopes of discovering other like-minded admirers of Patricia Highsmith or dismissive critics of Peter Greenaway, a coterie of enthusiasts or dissenters who induce temporary collective blindness to the diversity of their society by establishing fierce albeit fleeting allegiances through their preferences. Delving into the tastes of others is thus as much an ideological venture as an aesthetic one, a social experiment in which I manufacture the fiction of an ideal society where the troubling incompatibilities between the truck driver in his baseball cap and the millionaire in his Ferrari, the business woman in her Saks Fifth Avenue suit and the Midwesterner in his madras pants, have magically disappeared. My tactless strategies for strengthening consensus add a note of bluntness to my delivery intensified by a wide array of phrases meant to convey frankness, an admirable trait that, as an unapologetic liar who avoids public confrontations at all cost, I cannot by any stretch of the imagination claim as one of my primary virtues. My conversation is, however, clogged with the rhetoric of candor, with such doughty expres- sions of irrepressible openness as "to tell you the truth," "I'll have to say," "the truth is," "I'm going to level with you," "quite honestly," and "to be perfectly frank." I also exaggerate my capacity to get to the heart of the matter by sprinkling my speech with a profusion of such adverbs as "essentially," "simply," "in fact," "literally," and "actually," words that suggest that I have an almost Socratic ability to show others that things are not as they seem and that I alone am uniquely qualified to rip the wool off credulous people's eyes. As someone who has little place for honesty in his life and who conceals his caustic nature at every turn in order to avoid being ostracized as a vitriolic cynic, I am nonetheless always playing the role of Antigone, the guileless debunker of falsehoods who shoots straight from the hip, cuts to the chase, and tells it like it is, letting the world know</page><page sequence="11">Speaking/Listening 24 1 precisely what's on his mind. One of our cherished illusions as speakers is that, unlike others, we don't mince words, that we are our culture's conscience, its gadflies, lone heroes who assume the moral high ground in the war against hypocrisy and cant. This self-righteous drama of uncom- promising gutsiness is among the highest forms of self- flattery in a society enslaved to politesse, especially in the case of someone like myself who has learned to camouflage his often acerbic opinions and nod in amiable if noncommital agreement every time his interlocutor sings the praises of astrology, Ross Perot, the Pope, and twelve-step programs. We may enjoy convincing people that we are intolerant of deliberately misleading sophistry but at heart we are incorrigible obfuscators who delight in imprecision. I mitigate my own arrogance by using filler that strikes a note of trepidation and uncertainty - "sort of," "kind of," "I guess," "maybe," "apparently," "it seems to me" - expressions that are meant to humble us, to bring us down to the level of others, to impugn our authority as speakers so that we can submerge ourselves in the linguistic status quo, in a democracy of ineloquence: "it was sort of, you know, I guess maybe kind of silly for me to do what I did" and "we, urn, kind of ignored him because he was, I guess you could say, sort of rude to us, it seemed to me." We distrust glibness so completely that we actively model ourselves on the negative ideal of the mumbling imbecile who stumbles from one obscurity to the next and therefore never distinguishes himself from the herd, which loathes smart talk as evidence of snobbish self- assurance, the condescending presumptuousness of the elitist who breaks rank and defies the low standards of egalitarian incoherence jealously maintained by his peers. Filler helps us to dumb ourselves down so we don't seem too vain or individualistic but aspire instead to keep in line with the lowest common denominator of incommunicative philistines, would- be rubes who actively strive to preserve their anti-intellectual inexpres- siveness. In this regard, I am far more in line with the linguistic status quo at the beginnings of my sentences than at their ends, which are surprisingly grammatical and conclusive. I frequently make as many as five or six false starts as I struggle to break out of my customary silence and seize the floor, an act that, when contending with the domineering speakers of my social circle, often involves a full-scale coup d'état:</page><page sequence="12">242 DANIEL HARRIS Was it, was it, was it on Nob Hill? Yeah, the, and that is, the, Nob Hill, of course, I have the most profound memories of alienation from that place. And urn, it, it, so what it seems to be is that, they, he was just saying that sometimes during a person's life they were sexually active as a homosexual. But I was, I always have, you know, my, urn, one of the prices of being a sensitive person is paranoia. Rather than unraveling as the sentence progresses and the speaker loses track of what he is saying, as is the case with most people who get tangled in their clauses and leave most of their statements unfinished, hanging in thin air, my own sentences unravel at their beginnings which splinter into fragments. Each abandoned opening represents an unsuccessful effort to gain the upper hand and capture the attention of listeners who will relinquish the floor only after a vigorous scuffle in which, like unsuccess- ful burlesque performers, they are unceremoniously yanked off it. The shower of broken syntax that I fire at my loquacious friends constitutes the opening salvos of the war I wage to be heard, to rise above the often deafening voices of the stronger speakers who surround me. When I am with less voluble friends, who generously yield the floor the minute someone opens their lips, my syntax seldom collapses in such shambles. Instead, I resort to a subtler tactic and begin my sentences with an entirely meaningless utterance, the word "well," as in "well, I finally met Julie's children" or "well, I felt the story was a little sentimental." "Well" is as nonsensical as "urn" or "oh" and is more an instruction or a verbal gesture than a lexically significant morpheme - a sign that one is about to speak, much like a judge hammers his gavel to bring the court to order or a conductor taps the podium with his baton before the symphony strikes up the music. Just as the Alaskan Inuits have at least twenty ways of saying "snow," the very element of their lives, so I have at least twenty ways of saying "goodbye," the very element of mine, as is apparent during</page><page sequence="13">Speaking/Listening 243 protracted phone conversations, which I am always hastening to a curt conclusion, begging to get off the line and return to the tranquility of my reading and writing. My misanthropy becomes painfully obvious in the expressions I use to wriggle out of gabby tête-à-têtes that have no clear exit and that I therefore terminate by stating abruptly "I have to run/' "we' 11 talk later," "I'm expecting a call," "well, listen, F ve got to go," "could I call you back?", "we'll have to talk soon," "I'll let you run," "I know you're busy," "I'll be in touch," and "I have to get back to my writing." Whereas my greetings consist mostly of "hello," "hey," "hi," "how are you?," and "what's up?," I draw upon a broad range of synonyms for "farewell," a fact that suggests how uncomfortable I am during conversations and how I yearn wistfully to break free of the shackles of words, reverting to my quiescent state of anti-social torpor. II. Listening My two stock responses to the comments of others are hilarity and disbelief. The highest form of flattery in a society that has elevated the figure of the comedian to a position once occupied by the high priest and the soothsayer is braying laughter, the uproarious guffaws with which I explode when I am in the presence of someone who frightens me and whom I appease by playing my own built-in sound track, disguising my revulsion behind the nervous titters of painfully disingenuous merriment. Similarly, I flatter my friends by feigning surprise and incredulity and treating every comment about the aggravations of the weather and the skyrocketing price of gasoline as a startling revelation, a flabbergasting disclosure I acknowledge by saying "wow," "really?!!," "no!," "imag- ine!," "strange," "gosh!," and even (although very seldom) "that's so weird!" Surprise is a form of courtesy, a way of dramatizing the significance of our friends' statements, which we pretend are so unutter- ably amazing that we stand dumbstruck, our mouths gaping, stopped dead in our tracks by such uncanny pronouncements as "my allergies are acting up" and "I had to take my cat to the vet." The surprise topos ultimately has an anesthetizing effect on our conversation and, to some extent, on our thinking as well. It forces us to adopt a position of false naivete in which</page><page sequence="14">244 DANIEL HARRIS we inadvertently cretinize ourselves and lower our tolerance for the genuinely surprising, so accustomed are we to responding, with the same magnitude of astonishment, to news of a sprained ankle and an eye-witness account of an ax murder. Not only has the surprise topos vitiated our capacity to experience wonder and numbed us to a world that provides myriad occasions in which we genuinely should be astonished, but it has created a new set of clichés that actually mean the opposite of what they are supposed to mean, namely, "that's not surprising at all, that's banal, I have absolutely no reaction whatsoever to what you just said." Given the current climate of unqualified awe, when we express surprise, it is almost certain that what we are really feeling is stupefaction, boredom, and obliviousness. Surprise has become a reflex for someone who carefully sup- presses responses he has learned others will find unkind and embittered. If my speech bears the disfiguring hallmarks of my writing, my writing bears the scars of my insecurity as a speaker. I am such a polemical and abrasive writer in part because I fail so abjectly to be candid with my friends, who force me into the demeaning role of an amen chorus, a fawning claque that laughs when it is expected to laugh, commiserates when it is expected to commiserate, and expresses sympathetic outrage when it is expected to be outraged. The result is an over-powering internal monologue, a ^conversation where my real reactions are occurring and where the obedient yes-man talks back, throwing caution to the winds and rebelling against his passivity. My prose taps into this reservoir of unspoken responses and gives voice to the resentment I stifle in my daily interactions with others, which I view as so tragically flawed that I have invented a realm in which I live out thwarted fantasies of being frank, forthright, even blunt. My prose thus stands in a pathological relation to my speech, which has become the troubled muse of my satirical style, the protective armor that allows the introverted yes-man to become the vicious nay-sayer, to step out of the tightly serried ranks of the amen chorus and take his rightful place as a principal and not just a victim of the torrential spate of words in which I often feel I am drowning. While my more confident friends have exiled me to the audience, well beyond the glare of the footlights in which they so self-indulgently hold forth, I by no means remain silent in my seat but engage in what might</page><page sequence="15">Speaking/Listening 245 be called noisy listening, a type of rapt attention in which I make a kind of affirmative murmur, a steady stream of such insincere, if unfailingly effective prompts as "uh huh, really, oh, mmmmmm, yes, uh huh, okay, all right, great." Although I am reduced to silence, I continue offering assurances that I am tuned in and that my interlocutor has my permission to proceed, even when I long, above all else, to revoke this permission and restore balance to a conversation that, with my implied consent, has become unjustly unilateral. As an audience in revolt, I try to curb my incessant drone of approbation by refusing to vary it, as I do when I am more genuinely engaged, expressing my absorption by alternating my "ohs" with "ans" and "urns," my "okays" with "I sees" and "wells," my "all rights" with "uh huhs" and "yeses." When I cease listening and my blood pressure begins to rise as garrulous friends maunder on, criminally heedless of the impatience written all over my face, I lapse into a passive state of aggression and cease varying my soothing burble of assent, which I allow to become as mechanical and monotonous as possible. Like a metronome, I repeat "uh huh, uh huh" at carefully measured intervals, all in the futile expectation that the person yakking at me will notice that I have withdrawn into my shell and that they are talking to a tape recording. Noisy listening has always been a part of common courtesy, but nineteenth- and twentieth-century technology has inflated its importance. Before the invention of the telephone, we were probably much more silent when we listened because we could rely on visual cues like nods, eye contact, and facial expressions. The telephone has created a visual vacuum that we fill with noise- with grunts of concurrence, duckings of the tongue, tsk-tsks, and audible acknowledgments. The telephone has not changed the way we talk so much as the way we listen, exaggerating the auditory dimension of conversation and instilling us with new fears of silence, the unfathomable pauses that reverberate far more clamorously in the limbo of fiber optics than in the far less ambiguous realm of face-to- face encounters. As dissatisfied as I am with my role as a doormat that conve- niently stretches itself before the threshold of every talkative person I know, I cannot bring myself to violate what I have come to recognize as a major taboo in our society: the taboo against a listener's complete silence, a stricture we will allow to be infringed only under very unusual circum-</page><page sequence="16">246 DANIEL HARRIS stances, specifically, in a theater, a church, or a lecture hall, buildings equipped with proscenium arches, daises, pulpits, and podiums, architec- tural monuments to the temporary suspension of this basic law of dialogue. Garrulous people can tyrranize us only with our complicity, with the help of our noisy listening, for once we clam up and refuse to provide our meager encouragement of "ohs" and "uh huhs," all pretense of conversa- tion is abandoned and the speaker automatically transgresses the injunc- tion against soliloquizing. Not even the most courageous (or the most oblivious) chatterbox can continue talking if the listener plays dead, breaks eye contact, refuses to nod, or withholds his compulsive murmur, an act of civil disobedience that immediately transforms dialogue into an oration and hence traps the speaker in an untenable position, that of talking to himself, jabbering out loud to an empty room. The problem with playing dead is that it is a supremely difficult role to perform because the taboo works both ways, at once forbidding the speaker from proceeding without the listener's auditory compliance and enjoining the listener to continue inciting the speaker, whom we cannot simply abandon there alone out on the stage, slipping back into our seats in the darkened auditorium rather than remaining obediently in the limelight, assuming the subordinate position of the hero's sidekick, his confidante, like the maids and butlers in classical dramas. Anyone who has ever held the telephone receiver at arm's-length while an exasperating busybody launches into a blustering diatribe knows how difficult it is to keep from offering polite responses, so concerned are we about hurting the feelings of the speaker, who almost invariably will utter a panic-stricken "hello?!" after thirty seconds of dead air. Perhaps the solution to my most pressing social dilemma is not more speech but more silence, an intrepid refusal to participate in a virtually unbreakable pact, an orgy of mindless agreement, a brutal if bloodless war of words.</page></plain_text>
