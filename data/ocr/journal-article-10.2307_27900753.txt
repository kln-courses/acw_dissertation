<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. THE PRINCIPLE OF PARSIMONY AND ETHICAL NEU TRALITY. My object in writing this short note on Professor Laird's ex tremely interesting paper, published elsewhere in this number, is to deny that certain unpleasant consequences follow from Mr. Rus sell's acceptance of "Ockham's razor" as the supreme maxim of scientific philosophizing. Professor Laird believes, for example, that Mr. Russell in volves him in a falling away from the "ethical neutrality" he has claimed for his philosophy. For Mr. Russell's entities are not simpler in all respects, writes Professor Laird ; and if it be claimed that they are simpler in important respects then a subjective standard is introduced. We must here disentangle two separate questions. 1. It may be urged in the first place that Mr. Russell abandons his "supreme maxim" as soon as he accepts a large number of entities-by which, I take it, is meant the sensibilia out of which "things" are constructed. Now it does not seem to me that this view could be held if it were once realized what logical atomists are trying to do. Faced by a chair, the atomist-seeking to eliminate all unjustifiable entities-resolves it into a complex of sensibilia. He may thereby be led to express in a very intricate manner what is simple to common sense, just as the logistician expresses 2 + 2 = 4 in a garb highly unfamiliar to the beginner in arithmetic. But the atomist is nevertheless in this process strictly adhering to the prin ciple of parsimony in paring away every kind of entity of which he has no direct awareness. The scientist, on the other hand, pro ceeds in the opposite direction: he multiplies entities unceasingly.</page><page sequence="2">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. 449 The chair becomes a complex of molecules, which becomes a com plex of atoms, which is in turn resolved into a tangle of electrons and so on. The ultimate goal of this multiplication of entities is the construction of a conceptual scheme which is economically "de scriptive" of the increasingly complicated perceptual field opened up by experiment. Professor Laird's argument that the sole aim of science cannot be descriptive because models are widely used, seems to me to miss the whole point about models. For, in the hands of a Maxwell, models are used precisely because they enable those con cepts to be formulated between which simple relations hold-those relations having the property that the conceptual scheme so set up expresses the empirical laws in the corresponding perceptual do main. We may conclude, then, that while science is ready, for the purposes of economical description, to multiply entities philosophy seeks to limit such entities (even with loss of economy in state ment) to those of which we are directly aware. In other words, the scientific principle of economy is anthropomorphic; the prin ciple of parsimony is not. 2. It may now be urged, however, that though Mr. Russell's entities are simpler than those of science, as being all of one type, yet our choice of this system is egocentric. This seems to be what is at the back of Professor Laird's contention. In this he is adopt ing a similar attitude to that of Dr. Schiller who urges that the principle of parsimony is a maxim of practical convenience. "To a non-human mind," he says, "that was not pressed for time but disposed of all eternity it would be unmeaning or repugnant."1 This argument depends for its plausibility on the different forms in which the "razor" is expressed. If, however, we express it as Pluralitas non est ponenda sine n cessitaient, then we merely assert that you must not suppose that more things exist than you have evidence for. The criterion is the appeal to the external world. The standard is therefore not subjective, unless it is assumed that everything, including sense-data, is subjective. Furthermore, from what has been said above it is clear that this is not a maxim of "practical convenience." It is, in fact, usually convenient to contra vene it. If, for example, we always used Mr. Russell's construc tions instead of "things," our novels could only be read by those who disposed of all eternity. And if we avoided the use of the entity "number," Jones minor's text-book of arithmetic would be i Mind, N. S., Vol. XXIV, p. 402.</page><page sequence="3">450 THE MONIST. weightier than Jones minor. In other words, in practical affairs we emphatically do not (and never shall) use the razor to cut away our tables and chairs and numbers and electrons. Ockham's razor is on the contrary an impractical maxim only applied in those moments of critical analysis when we desire to know what errors we are daily committing from pragmatic motives.
