<plain_text><page sequence="1">EAGLE AND SERPENT A Study in the Migration of Symbols By Rudolf Wittkower In seeking to prove their case, 'diffusionist' ethnologists, who are concerned with the migration of symbols,1 have perhaps paid insufficient attention to those historical periods and civilizations in which the transmission of rites, symbols and ideas is adequately documented. And their opponents have been inclined to forget that in many fields of historical study the diffusionist method is already regarded as the natural starting-point of any discussion and, indeed, has often become a highly developed technique of research. On the other hand, students of European history have long realized that it is not enough, in order to understand a particular historical situation, to know whence a symbol came and whither it went. This method needs to be supplemented by the 'functional' method: that is, the attempt to under- stand the significance of a particular symbol in a given context. European history provides such a quantity of documentary material that it has long been possible to apply to it the functional method with positive results. In the present essay we shall deal with a very common symbol, the struggle between the Eagle and the Snake. Fights between eagles and snakes have actually been observed,2 and it is easy to understand that the sight of such a struggle must have made an indelible impression upon human imagination in its infancy. The most powerful of birds was fighting the most dangerous of reptiles. The greatness of the combat gave the event an almost cosmic significance. Ever since, when man has tried to express a struggle or a victory of cosmic grandeur, the early memory of this event has been evoked. Our procedure will be to argue from evidence to be found in the Mediterranean world. Since the migration of our symbol can be traced with certainty in Europe and the Mediterranean world of antiquity, it is reasonable to suspect that when the same symbol appears outside that area in different places and at different periods, it was not invented again inde- pendently, even if the connecting links are still missing. The most important part of such an investigation is the chronology, for the proof of the migration theory depends on it. Dates in ethnological material must quite often be based on uncertain suppositions; but in general, I hope, the chronological scheme here presented can be accepted. The 'functional' method applied to the European material shows that the same pictorial symbol, although always expressive of identical pairs of fundamental opposites, has in each case a very distinct meaning in the special historical setting in which it occurrs. Lack of space and lack of knowledge have compelled me to leave the nqn-European material in a more generalized form, although very often the exact function of the symbol could be worked out by specialists. 1 For a survey of ethnological methods cf.

Difusion of the Symbol in non-classical Civilisations Representations of eagles are known on pottery and cut stones of the very earliest civilizations, in Babylonia, in Elam, and also in the Indus valley. In Elamite pottery from Susa, where the persistence of an eagle- type can be followed up for many centuries from the early specimens of the 4th millenium,1 the bird with outstretched wings appears in three different ways : first alone, secondly with a snake placed near it, thirdly grasping in its beak or talons its prey, which is sometimes a snake.2 (P1. 49c) It has been proved that in many fields a connexion existed between the early Indus civilisation and the cultures of Elam and Mesopotamia. As eagle representations are rare in the Punjab and in Sindh,3 it may be inferred that the subject was introduced from the West without becoming indigenous in India. This inference is supported by the discovery at Harappa of a steatite pendant (c. 300ooo B.C.) showing an eagle with two snakes placed symmetrically above its wings without touching the bird (P1. 49b),4 a type otherwise unknown in India. The eagle is here probably a solar symbol. Such an interpretation need not altogether surprise us if we consider the stability of a number of symbols and conceptions in the Near East over thousands of years and the fact that later the eagle definitely appears as the bird of sun and heaven. In this context a sculpture in the round of an eagle, probably found at Adab,5 is of importance. Taken by itself its meaning would be obscure, but it is really the first in a long series of similar free statues representing eagles (P1. 5oa, b), of which the latest examples are unquestionably solar in character.6 Moreover there seem to be traces of a connexion between the eagle and light in Babylonian thought as early as in the 3rd millenium B.C. Ningirsu, the god of the Sumerian town Lagash, is the god of fertility, of war and of storm, and in inscriptions of King Gudea (c. 2500 B.C.) he appears as the master controlling "the order of the Heavens."' The lion-headed eagle Imgi or Imdugud is the attribute of this god,8 who sometimes actually takes on its shape.9 Imdugud is the divine bird who "shines on the firma- 1 Pottier, De'lgation en Perse.

To the eagle, the bird of light, the heavenly sphere is accessible. We come across the transport of the hero on the eagle's wings in Babylonian seals of the middle of the 3rd millenium B.C. (P1. 5 a)8-the prototype of Ganymede and the source of the Roman apotheosisg-but representations of an actual fight between eagle and snake seem rather rare. They occur on a seal of the third millenium B.C. with an eagle heraldically grasping two snakes10 (P1. 49d) and on the fragment in Constantinople of a soapstone bas-relief from Adab (P1. 49a)" which had inlays of coloured paste and can be dated in the early dynastic period (first half of 3rd mill.).12 As in both cases the eagle is victorious, a connection with the Etana myth, where the eagle is first vanquished and then liberated, is not possible. It is probably more correct to interpret these representations as Ningirsu's bird vanquishing the monsters of darkness, for this is confirmed by later Entemena (c. 2900 B.C.) in the Louvre with the eagle holding two lions in its talons (P1. 49h). Cf. Leon Heuzey, De'couvertes en Chaldde, 1884-1912, I, p. 261 ff. 1 Cf.

This would explain the fact that on seals of the Sargonid age (c. 2500 B.C.) a bird of prey, probably an eagle, appears as the monster Zu (H. Frankfort, Cylinder Seals, 1939, p. 132 f.) side by side with the lion-headed eagle as representative of the 'good' side. This would give us the historical starting point for tracing the solar conception of the eagle which then migrated from Babylonia to many other civilisations. 3 M. Witzel, Der Drachenkdmpfer Ninib ("Keilinschriftliche Studien" 2), 1920, pp. 38 f., 75 f., Io6 ff. Jastrow, Die Religion Babyloniens und Assyriens, 1905, I, pp. 153, 224, 459. Ninib combines many other qualities which in later civilisations are also attributed to the sun-god and to the eagle : he is the god of oracles, and of war, of thunder and light- ning, of hunting, agriculture and medicine. 4 Witzel, op. cit., p. 126 ff. The idea of this fight was transferred to a number of other gods of the Babylonian-Assyrian Pantheon. 5 A seal of the middle of the 3rd millenium B.C. actually shows Ningirsu's lion-headed eagle attacking the human-shaped monster.

The type of the fragment in Constantinople with the snake standing upright close to the eagle so that both heads are on the same level is still dominant, more than three thousand years later, in Byzantine art as the symbol of Christ triumphing over Satan (P1. 52b). In Egypt as well as in Western Asia the kings are descended from the sun.' Pharaoh was the son of Rd, and appears as Horus, the divine falcon, who after Pharaoh's death flies to heaven.2 The falcon here fulfils the same function as the imperial eagle in Roman apotheosis. The falcon is the only bird which can look unharmed into the rays of the sun, and it is at the same time the bird of oracles and prophecy.3 Thus it has all the qualities of the eagle and it is only logical that in late Egyptian texts it should be replaced by the eagle, under whose image Horus is now venerated.4 The winged disk of Horus is the best known Egyptian symbol. It was set over every temple to ward off evil, in commemoration of the victory of Horus over the monster Set, of light and good over darkness and evil. The solar disk consists of three different parts : the actual disk, the wings of eagle or falcon attached to it, and two uraeus snakes. In early times the first two elements appeared alone; the snakes are a later addition and do not occur regularly before the 18th Dynasty.5 The Egyptian solar disk recurs during the second millenium in Western Asia6 where it was identified with the solar eagle (P1. 5oh).7 We find it very 1 Calvin W.

Schafer in Die Antike, III, 1927, p. I24 ff. The development of the symbol from the simpler to the more composite form is pre- served in a late version of a myth. The sun-god Rd asks his son Horus to slaughter his enemies, a task which the latter fulfils in the shape of the winged solar disk. But there is a second stage of the fight in which the goddesses of the North and South in the shape of snakes join in the battle against Set. The text published and fully commented by H. Brugsch, "Die Sage von der gefliigelten Sonnenscheibe," Abhdl. d. kgl. Ges. d. Wiss. zu Giittingen, XIV, 1869, p. I73 ff. Cf. G. Roeder, Urkunden zur Religion des Alten Agypten, Jena, 1923, p. I20o ff. The real gene- sis of the symbol-one of the rare peaceful combinations of bird and snake-is probably the synthesis of a primitive chthonic snake cult with the higher forms of a solar cult. Cf. Theodor Hopfner, op. cit., p. 136 f. A similar story is told in the "Book of the Dead." Here the Sun-god, Rd, overcomes each morning the monster Aapep who lay hidden under the place where the sun rose, waiting to swallow up the solar disk. Such myths of the solar bird fighting the monster as a symbol of the oppossed forces of light and darkness, good and evil, are very much akin to the Babylonian myth of Ningirsu- Ninib's fight against the monster Labbu or that of Bel-Marduk against the dragon of the ocean Tiamat. 6 Goblet d'Alviella, "Recherches sur l'his- toire du globe ail6 hors de l'Igypte," Bull. de l'Acad. royale de Belgique, LVIII, I888, p. 623 ff. and The Migration of symbols, I894, p. 204 ff.

From here it was taken over into the Assyrian Pantheon as the sign of the solar god, Ashur, hovering over the heads of kings, and from Assyria it finally passed into Persia as the symbol of the god of light, Auramazda. In Assyrian representations the half-figure of the god Ashur frequently emerges from the solar disk. Both types, the simple solar disk and that with the god in the centre, passed on to Persia. Large eagle statues have been found in various civilizations of Western Asia belonging to the second and first milleniums B.C. The gigantic stone eagle from Yamoola in the Hittite Empire (P1. 5oa), seven feet high, indicates the importance of this cult.' Some scholars interpret this eagle as holding a twisted serpent in its talons,2 and, if this view is correct, it seems evident that the snake represents a vanquished opponent of the sun. Hittite eagle statues have been found as far away as Aleppo.3 In Hellenistic and Roman times eagle statues still appear on Syrian soil4 (P1. 50ob), though much reduced in size. They represent Helios and under their naturalistic form we can still sense the old Hittite conception. The link between the Hittite and the late Syrian monuments is provided by Assyria and Persia. There are many instances which suggest that the eagle as the bird of the sun was of fundamental importance in Persian belief and imagery. Zoroastrianism is based on the conflict between the god of light and goodness, Auramazda the eagle, and the power of darkness and evil, Ahriman the dragon.5 Such late monuments as the lintel of the porch of the sun-temple in Hatra, where a bust of Helios appears between two symmetrically arranged eagles with serpents in their beaks, is proof of the persistence of these ideas (P1. 50c).6 Long before the foundation of the Achaemenid Empire (550 B.C.) eagle representations appear in the decorative stylised bronzes of Luristan, made beween the 9th and 6th centuries B.C. by the Persian mountain tribes who between 1761-1185 B.C. were masters of Babylonia and brought back to their homeland Mesopotamian ideas and symbols. In some of these 1The significance of the eagle cult has not yet been definitely determined, cf. John Garstang, The Hittite Empire, London, 1929, p. I 15. But it seems very probable that there existed a Hittite sun cult with the eagle as its symbol. 2 Garstang, op. cit., p. 123. 3 For such eagle monuments cf. Garstang, op. cit., pp. I05, 115, I23, I43 and A. Moort- gat, Die Bildende Kunst des Alten Orients und die Bergvulker, 1932, P. 71 f. An eagle about 6 feet high, probably also of the middle of the 2nd millenium, has been unearthed in Tell Halaf. It was originally placed on a column before the fagade of the temple-palace. Cf. Max von Oppenheim, Tell Halaf. A new Cul- ture in Oldest Mesopotamia, 1933, Pl.

In Vedic mythology which influenced strongly Persian thought the sun-god Sfirya is also conceived as an eagle. (Cf. A. A. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 1897, p. 30 f.)

We have already seen that the falcon, whose function was later usurped by the eagle, was the bird of resurrection in late Egyptian civilisation. The same association with the eagle can probably be found in archaic Greece,2 and, in view of this chain we think it possible to ascribe the same meaning to the Luristan bronzes-all the more since they were found in graves. We have already mentioned the fact that there was intercourse between the Near East and India in very early times.3 Literary sources show that the Indian conception of the eagle is astonishingly near to that of the Near East and it has long been established that this is due to the exchange of ideas. One of Aesop's fables provides proof of a connection between India and Greece before Alexander the Great brought these two worlds into contact. The fable relates that in a fight between an eagle and a snake the latter was on the point of overpowering the bird when a reaper, witness of the fight, came to the help of the eagle and killed the snake with his sickle. Later on the grateful animal saved the same man from death. In the version of the fable known to us through &amp;Elian the decisive element is the old anta- gonism of good and evil and the final victory of the good.4 A story definitely related to this occurs in India.5 It is an old point of discussion whether the fable migrated from India to Greece or vice versa.6 Recently its origin has been placed hypothetically in the Achaemenid Empire of Darius.7 But as the essential features of the tale : the overpowering of the eagle by the snake, the rescuing of the bird, and his gratefulness, already appear in the Etana myth there is no reason why the story should not belong to a very old stock of Babylonian tales, particularly since the origin of certain animal tales has been traced to Babylonia.8 Indian literature from the earliest times onwards relates the enmity between the eagle-like bird Garuda or Suparna and the snake Naga. Garuda is the carrier of the sun-god Vishnu (P1. 54b),9 and Indra, in the form of an eagle, steals the soma, the drink of immortality.10 Agni, the god of fire, is 1 Andre Godard, Les Bronzes du Luristan, 1931, No. 205. 2 Cf. below p. 309. 3 Kolipada Mitra, "The Bird and Serpent Myth," Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society (Bangalore), XVI, 1925-6, p. 89 ff., 18o ff., collected much evidence for these relations. The author claims that the bird and serpent myth was diffused from India. 4 AElian, De natura animalium, XVII, 37 : "Agricola, quod non ignoraret aquilam Jovis nuntiam et ministram esse, et quod nosset feram et improbam bestiam esse serpentem, falce eam dissecuit." 5 Theodor Benfey, Pantschatantra, 1859, I, p. 363. 6 Cf. mainly Benfey, loc. cit., who is in favour of the Indian origin, and A.

All the gods sing a hymn to Garuda in which he is addressed as the sun, Indra, Vishnu, Agni, etc.2 It seems therefore certain, that the bird and snake fight had originally a cosmic meaning which was lost with the penetration of the motive into fairy tales and fables.3 Buddha himself or his pupils successfully reconciled the hereditary cosmic feud between bird and snake.4 The fight of Garuda and Naga is a favourite subject in Indian art, particularly with the Graeco-Buddhist school of Gandhara.5 In such versions of the theme the Naga appears in human form, the type being clearly dependent on the Greek group of Ganymede by Leochares.6 One also finds representations with a griffin-like Garuda under Near Eastern influence.7 Particular importance attaches to a purely Indian relief from Amaravati (2nd century A.D., British Museum, P1. 49m)8 because it points to the Indian derivation of similar Oceanic works (P1. 49n). In the North, Garuda and Naga representations can be found in frescoes in Chinese Turkestan of the 7th-9th centuries A.D. (P1. 49k, 1).9 But the heraldic type of these monuments with the double headed eagle proves them to be offsprings of the same Western Asiatic prototypes, coloured by Persian influences, which we find in contemporary works in Byzantium.10 From India the eagle and serpent myth spread also to the East and South. It was carried into China with Buddhism" (introduced in China 65 A.D.) and from here reached Japan through Korea.12 With the form of Vedic times. Cf. J. Ph.

In Java the Indian influence is particularly strong. One of the finest Javanese sculptures of about 1043 A.D. shows the portrait-statue of Airlanga, the first great king of Eastern Java, in his apotheosis as Vishnu riding upon Garuda who holds a Naga in his talons2-exactly as deified Roman emperors appear on coins above the eagle of Zeus (P1. 5If). As in the Near East, kings in India were of divine origin, and after their death they became once more the deity from whom they were descended. From India the eagle and serpent myth spread over the wide regions of the Pacific. Anthropologists have not yet satisfactorily explained the origin of the peoples in the Oceanic area, although we now know that a series of waves of migration from the west followed one after the other. It is now almost generally accepted that the last invaders of the islands had originally occupied India and had retired slowly to the islands of the Pacific before the advancing newcomers. The final settlement on the islands may not have been accomplished until about Iooo A.D.3 The many affinities of Indian and Polynesian mythology thus become intelligible by the contact of the two races. It is therefore not surprising to find in Melanesia and Polynesia a special bird-cult of definitely solar character. In Maori ceremonies of New Zealand the bird is called "Manu-i-te-Ra," that is "Bird in the Sun." Its name is also changed to "Tama-nui-te-Ra," the actual name for Sun.4 The southern tribes of Australia venerate their supreme god, who again is connected with a solar cult, in the shape of an eagle.5 In Melanesia and Polynesia the fight of eagle and bird is a familiar theme. We know wood-carvings of the scene from New-Guinea, New-Mecklenburgh, New- Ireland (P1. 49n), New-Zealand, and other islands of the Pacific.6 The bird is the totem sign of the dead, and the evil spirits conquered by it, are represented as serpents or lizards.'

There exist carvings in which the bird grasps the sickle of the moon instead of the serpent,' and this points to the fact that the fight of bird and snake was also associated with the old cosmic struggle of sun and moon, light and darkness.2 The highland of Iran is the centre through which Scythian tribes became acquainted with the eagle cult. The Scythians, who through their contact with the Greeks in the 7th century B.C. added to their Asiatic heritage a strong archaic Ionian influence, developed a distinct animal style in which fighting animals play a prominent role. But, unlike the heraldic style of Asia Minor or the Western naturalistic style this animal style follows its own laws of extreme decorative ornamentation, a style which in essence remained identical-in spite of many important changes-for fifteen hundred years over the whole North of Asia and Europe from the Pacific to Ireland. At a relatively early date (6th to 4th century B.C.) Scythian civilisation spread along the Danube up to Eastern Germany on the one hand and into the steppes of Central and Northern Asia on the other hand. Thus representations of the eagle occur not only in Southern Russia,3 east of the Bosporus, but also in the famous find ploughed up near Vettersfelde in Lower Lusatia (Germany, end of the 6th century B.C.),4 as well as in Little Russia west of the Urals6 and in Northern Siberia.6 Some of these objects closely recall Persian art, and even sometimes Babylonian types (P1. 49i) . On the other hand we know of a Scythian sword-sheath of the 6/5th cen- turies B.C. ornamented with a griffin-like bird holding a snake in its beak which is related to the archaic Greek tradition (Pl. 49f).8 The long life of the Scythian types and the contact of Scythia and India can be illustrated by an Indian bronze (P1. 49g), a thousand years later in date, which 1 Edge-Partington and Heape, op. cit., P1. 240, 4. 2 Luschan in Jahrbuch d. Preuss. Kunstslg., XXXVII, 1916, p. 205 ff. follows up the migration of the Greek Ganymede motive through the art of Gandhara, and through Java to the Bismarck-Archipelago. Interest- ing as this migration is, it is certainly wrong to treat the fight between bird and snake in the islands of the Pacific as a distorted reminiscence of the Ganymede motive. It is evident that carvings as that from New Ireland are dependent on Indian prototypes of Garuda and Naga (P1. 49m, n). Cf. also Luschan, Beitrdge, op. cit., p. 67. 3 Cf. Ellis H. Minns, Scythians and Greeks, Cambridge, 1913, PP. 207, 217; and Konda- kof-Tolstoi-Reinach, Antiquitis de la Russie Miridionale, 1891, pp. 248, 378, 379, 410. 4 Minns, op. cit., p. 238. 5Ibid., p. 258. 6 Ibid., p. 273- 'Pottier, Mim.

But we think that the original ritual content of the Scythian animal style cannot be doubted. A scholar like Rostovtzeff (Skythien und der Bosporus, 1931, p. 595 f.) interprets e.g. the eagle from Perm (Urals, ab. 500 B.C.) (P1. 49i) as a solar symbol and traces its origin back to Persia. And Alf6ldi ("Die geistigen Grundlagen des hochasiatischen Tierstiles," Forschungen und Fortschritte, VII, 1931, p. 278 ff.) tries to explain this style through the structure of the society, its myth and religious thought. 8 From the Don basin.

The solar conception of the eagle migrated from Iran through Scythia to the Mongolian countries of the North. But the Persian-Scythian filtrat- ion was not the only way by which the eagle symbolism reached Siberia. India is the second centre which-probably at a later date-strongly influenced the northern regions. The eagle plays still to-day an important part in the religious thought, the myth and the magic of the Mongols of Siberia.2 In Mongolian tales there appears an evil snake, which the hero Otshirvani engages in battle. As his power was not sufficient to crush the animal he fled to a mountain-the Mountain of the World familiar in many mythologies- and changed himself into the bird Garide. In this shape he was able to overcome the monster. The names of the Mongolian Pantheon reveal the origin of this myth. Otshirvani is a distortion of the Indian Bodhisattva as Garide derives from the Indian Garuda.3 With most of these Siberian tribes the eagle is taboo. The bird is the master of the sun, which appears after being called six times by him.4 As totem of the North Siberian Yakuts it is called Tafiara, that is "the protector." Now, Tainaira appears to be the solar deity of Turkish tribes.5 The eagle as master of light, as founder of the world, and as father of magic6 is called "Ajy" by the Yakuts, the same term (Aijo, Aija) occurs with the Lapps and the Finns (Aijai).7 The same complex of ideas associated with the solar nature of the eagle is to be found in a great number of tribes, from the Ainu,8 the aborigines of Japan, and the Yakuts in North Eastern Siberia, the Manchu-Tunguses9 and the Mon- gol-Buriats'0 to the Turks and the European Finns."' With all these peoples we find the same characteristic combination of the eagle cult with the 1 Cf. Bossert, Geschichte des Kunstgewerbes, III, p. 184.

In exact correspondence with these mythological conceptions of the Altaic and the Finno-Ugric races we find in Germanic mythology Odin in the form of an eagle nesting in the Tree of the World. Under its root dwells the snake; while trying to tear down the tree it is attacked by the eagle.2 It seems that these conceptions were introduced rather late into Northern Europe. The sun cult was known already to the inhabitants of Sweden during the Stone-Age." But there is no trace of a special function of the eagle before the great nordic epics were composed at the end of the first millenium A.D." It is one of the achievements of ethnological research of the last decades to have shown in many fields the connection of Ancient America with the Old World, a hypothesis already propagated by Alexander von Humboldt. It is now believed that the American continent was populated by aborigines coming from Asia at a time when a land-bridge existed in place of the Bering Strait, and that even at much later periods continuous waves of immigration followed the same route and also came across the Pacific.5 In many fields of civilisation a common Asiatic-American stock of beliefs and traditions can be established, not only with regard to the primary implements of civilization, such as the stone axe-toki, the same word in Melanesia, North- and South-America6-the canoe, baskets, etc.,' but also 1 Sternberg, p. 134, passim. Harva, p. 84 f. on the struggle of eagle and serpent at the Tree of the World.

The ethnographical unity of North Eastern Siberia and North Western America has long been recognized.2 The Chukchee, a tribe of North Eastern Siberia, are acquainted with the giant Noga-bird which preys on reindeer and man, elks and whales; and the tales about it show definite affinity with the Perso-Arab bird Roc and stories of "Sindbad the Sailor." Exactly the same stock of legends occur in Alaska.3 With all these tribes the eagle is known in the twofold function as ruler of the world and as shaman; it is also the thunderbird, and, even to the present day, taboo.4 Sometimes it is identified with the raven which appears as a solar bird over wide regions, from China and Japan to N.E. Asia and N.W. America.5 It is well known that for the Indians of North America the eagle is a special object of worship. Many tribes venerate eagle deities; the eagle plays a prominent r6le as a totemic animal, is associated with Sky- and Sun-gods and appears depicted on pottery, textiles, shields, etc.6 But there are much stronger links with the conceptions of the Old World. In the myths of the Kwakiutl, an Indian tribe on Vancouver Island, the poisonous double-headed water serpent which has the power to transform everything, men and objects, into stone, is the food of the thunderbird, the chief of the birds associated with the sky.' Moreover we find among the Indians of North America a number of versions of Aesop's fable of the grateful eagle which we related above.8 We do not know if this story is traceable between India and North America, but in view of all our arguments it is much more probable that the connecting links have been lost than that the story was invented more than once. The eagle motive is of paramount importance in the civilizations of Central and South America appearing again with the same implications as in the Old World. The Cora-Indians, who belong to the linguistic family of the Old Mexicans, have the following myth : in the West lives a powerful snake, symbol of the night, which is killed by the morning-star, and devoured by the eagle, the day-sky. The power of this belief was such that people enacted the overcoming of night by day in a magical ritual : they represented this scene at dawn in mimic dances. The myth has it that the eagle lives at 1 About common myths and tales cf. Ehrenreich, Die Mythen und Legenden der Siidamerikanischen Urvliker, 19o5 ("Zeitschrift f. Ethnol."

As solar bird and bearer of the surname of the sun god, it rises to heaven at day- break and takes its place in the centre of the sky.2 The conception of the old Mexicans is very similar. In the morning prayer the rising sun is invoked as an ascending eagle.3 The sun, the supreme deity appears in the shape of an eagle and tears to pieces a snake and a rabbit, symbols of night-sky and moon.4 The scene is often represented in Mexican manuscripts (P1. 49 o).5 The same symbolism occurs in the strange ritual of human sacrifices, the key-note of Mexican religion. The heart and blood of the victim were offered to the sun-god in a bowl, with the sign of the sun in its centre and a border, representing eagle feathers. Underneath the earth-monster is carved. Such bowls which the Mexicans called 'cup of the Eagle'6 are not rare in European collections.7 This sacramental ritual was intended to increase the vigour of the sun and to rejuvenate nature." The ritual is still more complicated, as the warriors who offer the victims are themselves identified with eagles. The conventional designation of brave warriors is actually 'eagle',9 and there exist shields with the image of the eagle holding a serpent in its beak, just as on Corinthian vases.10 The eagle tearing a serpent whilst sitting on a nopal cactus is the old emblem of the Mexicans. It is in fact the hieroglyph of the Aztec centre of civilisation, the town Mexico-Tenochtitlan, which was founded about 1325 A.D. A detailed analysis has shown that the name Mexico-Tenochtitlan is merely a designation of the old cosmological contrast of sun and darkness." This national emblem has proved to be of extraordinary tenacity; it sur- vived the Spanish conquest of the sixteenth century, the short reign of the Emperor Maximilian (1864-67),12 and is still used at the present day by the Mexican Republic as a coat-of-arms and on coins (P1. 54k),13 although it has long lost its magic power. 1 Cf. above p. 303, note I. 2 K.

Frobenius, Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes, 1904, p. 356. 5 Often the eagle only grips the rabbit with its talons, but in our plate 490 from the Codex Borgia (Seler, op. cit., I9O6, II, P1. 52) it tears both enemies with beak and talons. 6 Seler, Ges.

Connected as they were in many ways with the Aztecs of Mexico, their religion was based on sun worship and their government was a theocracy founded on the divine kingship of the rulers who claimed to be the direct representatives of the sun on earth. Manco Capac, the child of the sun and reputed founder of Inca civilisation (c. Iloo A.D.),1 was joined in his childhood by an eagle which never left him. This recalls many Asiatic legends, among which the most famous is the legend that Achamenes, the ancestor of the Persian dynasty, was brought up by an -eagle.2 The 'Ganymede-motive' which was also known to the Indians of North Americas appears again in the Peruvian setting. The life of Manco Capac's grand- father was saved by an eagle which carried him away in its talons.4 The eagle in Peru is clearly a solar symbol. The Inca tradition also incorporates the fight between eagle and snake. A Peruvian legend recalls that the Inca Pachacutec (i5th century A.D.) once vanquished an enemy tribe with the help of an eagle which descended from heaven and overcame the snake, the supporter of the enemy.5 Whether or not these two animals should be regarded as totems, the fact remains that through the eagle the child of the sun achieves victory over evil ifi the shape of the snake. When Columbus landed on the coast of Costa Rica, he saw the natives wearing necklaces of gold in the form of eagles, lions and other animals. Modern excavations in the South of Costa Rica (Talamanca) have yielded many of these amulets, among which appear eagles carrying in their beaks serpents shaped like lightning6 (P1. 49P). Traces of sun-worship were discovered by early travellers in these regions, which, being placed half way between the Mayas of the North and the Inca Empire of the South, were influenced by these highly developed civilisations.7 It seems therefore justifiable to associate the eagle and snake amulets with sun-worship. The reader will have noticed that in discussing the occurrence of the eagle symbolism in America we have been dealing with relatively late dates, and, x Clements R. Markham, The Incas of Peru, 1910o, p. 95- 2 The prototype is thelegend of the Babylon- ian hero Gilgamesch who was saved by an eagle.

Although so far we have been dealing with scattered and fragmentary material, we have been able to show that the meaning of our symbol varied in different contexts, that the eagle could be the bird of kingship as well as of prophecy, of magic as well as of mantic, an attribute of the sun as well as a symbol of resurrection, that its struggle with the serpent could denote earthly victory or triumph on a more cosmic scale. But when we turn to more recent history and examine the occurrence of the same symbols in European culture since classical times, we shall be able to determine with much greater exactness the variations in their meaning -remembering, however, that all these variations are linked up by a single basic idea : the struggle of eagle and serpent always represents the fun- damental opposition of light and darkness, good and evil.1 2. Greece and Rome If we now turn to the Mediterranean world, we are faced with a number of puzzling problems. Classical archaeologists have collected the relevant material in Greece and Rome,2 but without always offering satisfying inter- pretations. In the following notes I shall only attempt to suggest possible solutions for some few of the vast number of recorded instances of eagle symbolism. In Greek mythology the eagle is the only bird of strictly divine character.3 In a chapter entitled "The Sun as the Bird of Zeus" Cook4 argues convincingly that in early Greek belief the sun was already conceived as a bird. Cook also proves that in pre-Hellenic times Zeus, before becoming the anthropo- morphic individual sky-god of the Greeks, was the animate Sky itself.5 It is true that in early Greek religion there was no room for a proper solar cult. Only after the supersession of demons and earthgods by the Olympians does the sky become the centre of the anthropomorphic Greek Pantheon. And the eagle finds its place by the side of the sky-god Zeus. The conception of the eagle as bearer of the thunderbolt and as carrier of lightning and fire 1 Wensinck, Tree and Bird as cosmological Symbols in Western Asia (Verhdl. Kon. Akad. van Wetenschappen te Amsterdam) i 921, p. 46 f. identifies eagle and serpent as repre- sentations of two of the mightiest cosmic entities, the sun and the ocean.

But the eagle is not only the attribute of Zeus; it is often identified with the god.2 This identification confirms the view that the eagle was originally the sky. An old myth supports this view; it relates that Zeus in the form of an eagle came from his birthplace in Crete to Naxos.3 It is also tempting to relate the eagle cult in Asia Minor to that of Greece.4 Just as the eagle stood on top of a column next to the altar in the temple at Tell Halaf,5 so before the altar of Zeus on Mount Lykaion were two columns with figures of gilded eagles facing the sunrise.6 There are other instances pointing to the early association of the eagle with light. In Aeschylus' Suppliants (212 f.) the sun is invoked as the bird of Zeus. In popular belief the eagle still haunts the heights of Olympus as a symbol of the sun.7 The eagle is also in Greece and Rome the bird of divination par excellence.8 We have here again the old double nature of the eagle as bird of light and bird of magic common to many civilizations.9 These two sides are reflected in Greek literature in the fight of the eagle with the snake. The fighting motive occurs for the first time in the Iliad (xII, 20o f.), here with a specifically mantic meaning. An eagle with a snake in its beak appears above the heads of the Trojans while they assault the ships of the Greeks. The snake liberates itself from the claws of the bird, and falls into the Trojan lines. This is taken as a bad omen, and, in fact, the attack on the ship fails. Aristophanes still uses the same symbol for a political oracle, but makes a travesty of it (Knights, 197 if.). In the mystic atmosphere of late Greek civilization the magic power attached to this symbol is strange enough to be explicitly mentioned. Apollonius of Tyana (2nd century A.D.) tries to get rid of a snake plague by putting on a column the figure of an eagle with a snake in its claws. In a rite of sympathetic magic he employs the symbol of the good to overcome the evil.10 As the bird of magic the eagle is especially significant in the interpretation of dreams.11 These qualities have an inexhaustible underground life in folklore. Eagle and snake or bird and monster survive in the books of dreams of the Middle Ages.12 1 Ibid., II, p. 351 f., with further references, and p. 777f. Cumont, Et. Syr., op. cit., p. 58.

Nicetas saw the monument in the hippodrome of Constan- tinople, and it is significant in our context that the wings of the eagle were made to be used as a sundial. For his miracle Apollonius was probably inspired by the Brazen Serpent. Moses made use of a similar magic procedure in which, however, the image of the serpent itself is the agent of healing. 1x Pauly-Wissowa, p. 373.

In Caesar's fight against the younger Pompey the eagles of Pompey's legions dropped golden thunderbolts from their talons into his camp, and then flew off to the camp of Caesar, thus indicating that the victory would be with the latter. Here the thunderbolts bring destruction, like the snake in Homer. In both cases the bird of victory carries the symbol of defeat. This parallelism of snake and thunderbolt points back to a magical stage in which the zigzag form of the snake made it the natural equivalent for lightning.2 In its classical period Greek civilization evolved a scientific natural history. Aristotle3 states that eagle and snake are enemies and that the eagle feeds on the snake. But besides this scientific statement we can see in Aristotle a survival of the old association of the eagle with light and sky. For he goes on to say that the eagle flies to great heights in order to have a wide view. This is the reason, he says, why this bird alone is held by man to be the bird of the gods. There exist a number of scattered early monuments showing the fight of eagle and snake. In the versions on Minoan4 and early Greek engraved stones (P1. 49e)5 the struggle can only have talismanic significance. At a much later period, according to literary tradition,6 King Areos of Sparta used a signet-ring with this symbol as a protective amulet: evil (snake) is to be warded off by the magic effect of the picture. In a special case it seems possible to show that in early Greek thought the eagle was connected with the souls of the dead. The famous bronze hydria of Grachwil (near Berne),7 the product of a Greek workshop of the 6th century B.C., has a handle decorated with the 'Great Mother', the Mistress of Animals of oriental origin. To the left and right of her head are chthonic snakes, and on her head stands the eagle (P1. 50f), a unique feature which can only be explained through the function of the vessel as a cinerary urn.8 There are two larger groups of objects showing the fight of' eagle and snake. In the first, consisting of Corinthian vases of the 6th century, the device occurs with its mantic significance. The eagle alone, or eagle and serpent, are the accompaniment of the departing warrior,9 or appear 1 Roman History XLIII, 35 (Loeb Class. Libr. IV, p. 275). 2 Cf.

And when the Greek warrior decorated his shield with the symbol, it was to attract victory by an act of sympathetic magic: as the eagle kills the snake, so the warrior will slay his enemies (P1. 51i).2 In such cases the symbol is relevant to the story told on the vase, but when it occurs as the only decoration (P1. 5zh) it is related directly to the spectator in an apotropaic sense, like the contemporary 'eye-cups.'3 It is, of course, difficult to decide when the device has sunk to the stage of pure ornament. The second group in which the symbol frequently appears consists of coins of Greek cities particularly between the 6th and 3rd centuries B.C. (P1. 51g).4 There are reasons for supposing that in this context it was often used to bring about or to preserve political or athletic victory.5 This is obvious in coins from Elis in which Nike appears on the reverse; in coins from Cyrene, which show the eagle-snake symbol on one side and the quadriga on the other; and in coins from Agrigentum, in which eagle and snake hover above the quadriga.6 Sophocles in the Antigone (I io ff.) employs the fight of eagle and snake as a simile for the fighting armies and it was even used in the same sense by Horace in the famous fourth ode (book IV). In modern times the image is still used as a symbol of victory and as a political emblem; it con- veyed the same meaning to the enlightened Greek communities of the classical period, though the mantic implications seem still to be quite alive.7 In the Roman Empire too the eagle had a political and military bearing. The eagle of the legions is the emblem of Roman power and majesty.8 When the conquest of the snake by the eagle appears on the Triumphal Arch at Pola (P1. 5Ik)9 it is an emblem of victory and triumph.

Zethos and Amphion bind Dirke to the horns of the bull because she had tormented their mother. She must now suffer death at the hands of the righteous as the evil snake is killed by the eagle.' But the symbol plays a more important part in the religious sphere. The eagle is the bird of apotheosis and resurrection. As Jupiter is carried aloft by the eagle2 (P1. 5Ib) so the soul of the deified emperor is carried by him to heavens (P1. 5Ic). But this device is not limited to the emperor; it also occurs on Roman tombstones (Pl. 5Id),4 and when it is replaced by the fight between eagle and snake5 it signifies the triumph of the heavenly realm over the dark chthonic forces (P1. 5ok). The occurrence of the symbol on the famous sarcophagus in S. Lorenzo fuori le Mura is particularly instructive (P1. 50g). Cumont6 has shown that the bacchic representations on the group of sarcophagi to which it belongs, illustrate the Dionysiac enthusiasm at the prospect of eternal happiness in heaven. The small eagle-snake device which accompanies the large Bacchic scenes must stand for some such idea as the victorious liberation of the soul.7 This sarcophagus also shows the source of these ideas. It was made in Athens at the beginning of the 3rd century A.D. on the basis of Syrian models.8 On Syrian soil Hellenistic religion was the vehicle for the revival of old Asiatic solar conceptions. In the Greco-Roman age the local Semitic Baals were everywhere assimilated to and identified with Zeus,9 and Zeus was transformed from the Sky-god to the Sun-god so that his eagle became the bird of Helios (P1. 5ob, d).10 Under this spell even the Hebrew Jehovah was turned into a solar Zeus; the Jews of the Dispersion called their god Theos Hypsistos," and represented him as an eagle.12 And just as in the Mithraic liturgy the initiate enter heaven as eagles,13 the bird of Helios is 1 According to Pliny (nat. hist.

Tombstones with representations of the eagle occur often in Levantine art from the 3rd century B.C. onwards,2 and even in Arabia.3 These tombs also show the bird killing the snake (P1. 50i)4 or both creatures separately,5 symbols which can only stand for the deliverance of the soul from earthly chains. Diodorus' description of the pyre prepared by Alexander the Great for the body of Hephaistion must be interpreted in this sense : on the second story of the pyre there were eagles bending down towards snakes.6 The varied use made of the eagle-snake symbol in the Graeco-Roman world may seem puzzling at first. Yet it is not difficult to explain how the same sign can assume at the same time a supernatural and a distinctly worldly meaning. Both uses have their roots in primitive magic and ritual. Both are based on the belief in the practical efficacy of symbols. Since material victory and spiritual salvation are not distinguished, the same sign if painted on a shield will bring victory in battle, and if carved on a tombstone will secure immortality. Moreover, the simultaneous use of the symbol for divination on the one hand, and for victory on the other, can be understood as implied in the natural development of society. Frazer has shown that the king in many parts of the world is the lineal successor of the magician in primitive society;7 therefore the eagle as the sign of magicians and kings is identical, and the magician overcoming the powers of darkness is in another stage of society equivalent to the king vanquishing his enemies. 3. The Christian Interpretation Christianity, which grew up in the midst of the Syrian solar cults, turned the eagle symbolism into a specifically Christian formula.8 The actual iden- tification of Christ with the sun, and therefore with the eagle, became an integral part of patrological and later theological literature.9 On the Antioch chalice (c. 4-5th century A.D.) Christ is enthroned with the eagle under his footstool, like a new Jupiter (P1. 51 e).10 And the eagle appears as a hieroglyph for Christ in a great many oriental capitals of the 5th and 6th centuries A.D., as well as on mosaics and sarcophagi of the same period.

But Christian eagle symbolism covers a much wider range of meaning. A number of different ideas current in the Hellenistic world were taken up by the Christians and adapted to the exposition of their faith. In reviewing the situation one finds that round the eagle four main subjects were evolved. The Greek Physiologus, a collection of animal tales with Christian allegorisa- tions probably brought together in Egypt in the 2nd century A.D., contains the following story about the eagle : When he grows old, his flight becomes heavy and his eyesight dim. He first seeks a pure spring of water, then flies aloft towards the sun, burns off his old feathers and the film over his eyes. Finally he flies down to the spring, dives into it three times, thereby renewing himself and becoming young again. This curious story is used as a simile for man : when the eyes of his heart are grown dull, he should fly aloft to the sun of righteousness, Jesus Christ, and rejuvenate himself in the ever flowing spring of penance in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.2 This is meant as an interpretation of the words of the psalm mentioned above : "so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's." This same text was also accompanied by another legend. In Augustine's commentary on the Psalm3 we read : "In a way suggested by nature he dashes his beak against a rock and smashes off the encumbrance, and so returns to his food; in everything he is restored, so that he becomes young. Hence, thy youth shall be renewed like the eagle's." The rock is Christ (I Cor. X, 4) and he is the means of resurrection. Still another quality of the eagle occurs in early Christian literature, prominently in Ambrose's Hexaemeron4 (c. 389). He tells us that the eagle rears only one of its two eaglets and kills the other. He rejects Aristotle's opinion that this is done because the eagle is too mean to feed two offspring; he quotes Moses5 as his testimony for the eagle's sense of pity. Ambrose argues that the eagle flies with its young into the rays of the sun to find out which of them is the true offspring and which the changeling. The bird that cannot endure to look into the glaring light will die, and its death is therefore actually brought about by the eagle's intrepidity. In the Pseudo-Ambrose's Sermones we find the story of the eagle and the snake. The devouring of the snake by the eagle is interpreted as a simile for Christ overcoming Satan.6 1Extensive material presented in Jer- phanion's book, pp 136-45.

The Physiologus story of rejuvenation is made up of at least three different main motives : the preliminary flying towards the sun,' fall and rebirth, and the "pure spring." The Water of Life is one of the universal myths familiar in the Near East for thousands of years. Fall and resurrection- for the rejuvenation of the Physiologus is a spiritual resurrection-has also a long history in the East. We may call to mind the Etana myth where this motive occurs in another setting.2 But the whole idea is a direct off- shoot of the pagan designation of the eagle as the bird of resurrection. Our second tale about the bending of the eagle's beak with growing age occurs in Aristotle's Historia Animalium.3 But according to him the bird must die of starvation. This story is of Egyptian origin, as we find it in Ho- rapollo4 : "Desiring to represent an old man, dying of hunger, they paint an eagle with its beak extremely hooked; for as it grows old its beak becomes extremely hooked, and it dies of hunger." The passage of the Psalm on which both rejuvenation tales comment must be an adaptation of the old Egyptian legend of the miraculous Phoenix which renews its youth every 500 years. Although we can thus trace antecedents of the two rejuvenation allegories their composite epic character limits their use to the Christian world. This is also partly true with the story of the eagle's flight towards the sun to test its offspring. The tale actually consists of two different parts : the solar flight and the test, and this must be a relatively late fusion. It is also perhaps first to be found in Egypt;5 it is related by Aristotle, and later by Pliny, Aelian and many other ancient writers.6 From these sources the combined motives migrate into the writings of a great many Christian authors. The solar flight alone has a much longer pedigree. In a way the solar flight of the eagle and its fight against the serpent are two sides of the same problem. The solar flight and the gazing into the sun symbolise the sun- nature of the eagle,' and the fight with the snake the victory over the powers of darkness. aere alarum remigio subvectando supportat, hos obunco rostro, et armatis quasi quibus- dam telis, pedibus suis lacerat ac divellit; quos cum devorat... ita ergo et Christus Dominus unam diligit Ecclesiam, ut aquila nidum suum...

In the later revisions of the Physiologus all three motives occur together. From the early sources they migrate singly or together into the bestiaries of the later Middle Ages.' Another way of filtration is through the encyclopaedists, from Isidore and Rabanus Maurus to Vincent of Beauvais and Brunetti Latini. A last channel is formed by the histories of natural science which since the I3th century (Thomas of Cantimprd and Albertus Magnus) take up the tradition of Aristotle and Pliny but always mingle it with features of the Christian animal tales. From now on the popular animal tales live side by side with learned works. But there exist many transitions, for a great number of authors tried to combine both trends. This type of literature ends in the late I6th and I7th centuries with the erudite works of Gesner, Aldrovandi (P1. 541) and Bochart2 who in an encyclopaedic attempt such as has never been undertaken since collected an enormous mass of material about the eagle, scientific as well as legendary, from Christian, ancient and even Arabic sources.3 in Egypt the falcon was supposed to gaze unharmed into the sun. Eagle representat- ions of many different peoples are certainly meant to show the bird flying aloft towards the sun. 1 Cf. Mdlanges d'Archiologie, d'Histoire et de Littdrature II, 1851, p.

It occurs in Rabanus (De univ. VIII, 6) in Hildebert's Physiologus (c. 1135, P. L. I71, 1217), in Hugo de Folieto (De bestiis, I, 56), and also in Alexander Neckham, Albertus Magnus, Vincent of Beauvais, Brunetti Latini, but not often in later literature and the arts. Allusions in Elizabethan literature, on which the Physiologus has left an important mark (the relevant material has been collect- ed by H. H6hna, Der Physiologus in der elisabethanischen Literatur, Erlangen, 1930 and P. Ansell Robin, Animal Lore in English Literature, 1932, p. I59 ff.). But that the symbol remained alive is proved by such a representation as that on the frontispiece of the Biblia Sacra cum glossis N. Lyrani (Venice, 1588), where an eagle is shown sharpening its beak on a rock in the water, with the quotation from Psalm 103, 5. The diving into the fountain is traceable through many Physiologus versions (cf. Max Goldstaub and Richard Wendriner, Ein Tosco- Venezianischer Bestiarius, Halle, 1892, p. 386); it occurs alreadyinpatristic literature (Origen, Jerome, cf. Lauchert, pp. 71, 77) and later in such works as Bartholomew Glanvil's encyclopaedia (De proprietatibus rerum XII, i), or popular manuals of natural science and medicine, such as the Hortus Sanitatis (De avibus I). It can be traced in German mediaeval literature (cf. Lauchert, p. 193), in English literature from Caxton's Mirrour of the World to Lyly's Euphues, Dekker's Wonder of a Kingdom, Spenser's Faerie Queene and Shakespeare's Henry IV. A pictorial type, appearing first in the Greek Physiologus (cf. Strzygowski, Der Bilderkreis des griech. Physiologus, 1899, p. 28 of MS) is almost limited to the long series of mediaeval bestiaries, particularly from the I2th to the I4th centuries. (cf. M. R. James, The Bestiary. Oxford, I928, p. 43, fol. 3Ia). From here the motive spreads into such works as an Austrian book of models of the I3th century (Vienna, Nat. Bibl. cod. 507, f. 3v, cf. H. J. Hermann, Die deutschen Roma- nischen Handschr. Beschreibendes Verz. d. illum. Handschr. in Oesterreich VIII,, 2.' 1926, No. 231, P1. 41), into the illustrations of Psalters (cf. A. Goldschmidt, Der Albanipsalter in Hildesheim, 1895, p. I 16, fig. 34) and into the sculptural ornamentation of churches (cf. G. C. Druce in The Antiquary, 1914, P. 250). For the occurrence of the motive in Arabic literature, cf. Wensinck, Tree and Bird Cult, op. cit., p. 38 f. Of much wider importance than the two</page><page sequence="27">316 RUDOLF WITTKOWER The only motive readily expressible in visual terms, the fight of eagle and snake, although described in a number of ancient authors from Aristotle to former symbols is the flight into the sun and the test of the eaglets. From patristic sources (cf. Keller, op. cit., p. 268) it passed through Isidore (Ethym. XII, 7, 11), Rabanus (De univ. VIII, 6) into the bestiaries, encyclop- aedias and collections of exempla (cf. Gold- staub-Wendriner, op. cit., pp. 196 f., 384 f.). Cf. e.g. Cecco d'Ascoli's cosmological poem dell'Acerba and the version of the Physiologus due to Leonardo da Vinci based on it (cf. Goldstaub-Wendriner, op. cit., pp. 240-54; for German poetry cf. Lauchert, p. 171 f.) Sculptures : Strasbourg Cathedral, north side, late 13th century; Cologne Cathedral, pews, c. 1350, (cf. B. von Tieschowitz, Das Chorgestihl des Kdlner Domes, 1930, P1. I4b); Ribbesford (Worcestershire) doorway, i2th century (Druce, The Antiquary, 1914, p. 250f.). Cf. also stained glass in Lyons Cathedral (E. P. Evans, Animal Symbolism, 1896, p. i 18, with many more references). Secularisation of the motive in the I6th century. It was now often used to allegorise the legality of the royal descent and to reject intruders into the lawful succession or to demonstrate the undiminished vitality of the race. Although by no means only used by ruling families, the dependence on the old idea of divine kingship is obvious. In this sense it occurs already in Wolfram von Eschenbach (Lauchert, p. 196). Later material : medal of Duke Francesco Maria of Urbino (Hill, A Corpus of Italian Medals, 1930, Nos. 318, 319) emblem of Duke Gabriele Cesarini (Jacopo Gelli,Divise, Motti, Imprese, Milan, 1916, No. 10o4), imprese of Carlo Emanuele I of Savoia in 1584 (Gelli No. Io05), medal of Henry III of France, 1585 (J. de Bie, La France Mitallique, 1636, p. 232, P1. 78). Important symbol in the disputes of succession in England : Medals directed against the Old Pretender, son of James II, I688 and 1689 (cf. Chevalier, Histoire de Guillaume III, 1692, pp. 94, 104; Edward Hawkins, Medallic Illustrations of the History of Great Britain and Ireland, I885, I, pp. 644, 664 f.). Medal for Frederick, Prince of Wales, son of George II, 1792 (cf. Cat. of Prints and Drawings Brit. Museum, Satires, II, I873, No. 1820). Used as a simile for love in a famous sonnet by Ariosto (Perche simili siano e degli artigli...), and by Bernardo Accolti (06th century, cf. Gelli, op. cit., No. 1429). In English literature: Lyly, Euphues, Dryden, Britannia Rediviva, Shakespeare, Henry VI-here used as a simile for Prince Edward's descendence : Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird, Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun. (III, ii, I). Still more often than the test of the young eagles we find the first part of the story alone namely the flight and the gazing at the radiant sun as a symbol of fearlessness, intre- pidity and magnanimity. Dante (Paradiso I, 48) knows it as well as Chaucer (Parl. of Foules 330 f.), it appears in Jacopo de Voragine's Legenda Aurea and becomes a regular image in popular poetry (cf. F. von Logan, Deutsche Sinn-Getichte, 1654 : "Wer nicht hat des Adlers Augen, Muss der Sonne Strahlen weichen."). It is common as an impresa in the I6th century: Galeazzo Fregoso and Aretino (cf. L. Dolce, Imprese, 1566, and for further material : Ruscelli, Imprese, p. 245; Camillo Camilli, Imprese, 1586, p. 40 ff.); it is adopted in coats-of-arms (Gelli, No. 96; Clary, H6tel de Bagis, Toulouse) and used in a personal religious context (Hill, Corpus, No. Ioo9; Gelli, No. 1472), it stands for the qualities of the ruler (Thomasin of Zirclaria, Welscher Gast, cf. Lauchert, p. 196. -Medal for Charles VI of Sweden, 1725, cf. (Euvre du Chevalier Hedlinger didied Gustave III de Suede, 1776, P1. VII, p. 6) and for political strength and firmness (Gelli, No. 13 3; E. Bahrfeldt, Miinzen und Medaillen d. Provinz Preussen, 190o, I, No. 1838), it is even an amorous symbol. The beloved is the sun at which the lover alone is allowed to look (Gelli No. 396, also No. 654). The idea that the eagle can look steadily at the sun results from his extraordinary eyesight which is already mentioned by Aris- totle; from Isidore onwards the word aquila is explained as deriving from the sharpness of the bird's eyesight. Through sympathetic magic the eagle is therefore capable of curing failing human eyesight. Aelian and Pliny recommend mixtures with brain and gall of the eagle as effective medicine. This remains an argument in mediaeval works on medicine, and the magic power of the eagle in curing illnesses of the eye is common to the folklore of many peoples (cf. e.g. Harper in Beitr. zur Assyrologie, 1894, II, p. 405). The legendary eyesight of the eagle induced</page><page sequence="28">EAGLE AND SERPENT 317 Cicero,' occurs rarely in Christian theological literature,2 but retains un- impaired its old efficacy as a pictorial symbol. It seems that the symbol did not become current in Christian imagery before the 6th or 7th century A.D. At that time we find it established in the eastern part of the Mediterranean; it occurs in Syrian MSS,3 on a church wall in Athens,4 or on an Egyptian incense box5 (Pl. 52i), always reminding the spectator of the Christian mystery of salvation. But the period in which the symbol is commonest begins in the Ioth century and culminates in the 12th and I3th centuries. After our survey of the pre-Christian history of this symbol its migration into Europe can easily be disentangled.6 Early Christian artists were faced with two basic pictorial types of the symbol, the eastern and the Graeco- Roman. The stylized heraldic composition of the Near East had been transformed into the naturalistic Graeco-Roman group even in the frontier provinces of the Roman Empire. But under the surface the oriental type survived, coming to the fore again in Byzantine times. On the other hand the Western naturalistic conception never loosened its grip throughout the centuries. The oriental type found its way to Europe directly through Byzantium or with the Arab migration through Spain. This explains the appearance of very similar representations in Spanish Beatus MSS of the Ioth to the 12th centuries7 and on a relief on the fa?ade of the ancient Metropolis in Athens (6-7th century A.D., P1. 52b).8 In both cases the bird is shown in profile pecking at the head of the snake which stands erect before it, its body twisted into a curious knot. This type is strongly influenced by Persian designs of Sassanian times on bronze jugs and silver bowls, but it can be traced back to Babylonian prototypes of the 3rd millenium B.C. (P1. 49a). Another similar oriental type, with the eagle seen frontally, bottle-like in shape, its legs straddled and its tail spread out, points to an even more direct influence of early Babylonian representations (P1. 49h). The purest embodiment of this type can perhaps be found on a rather late monument, Bernini to choose an eagle flying towards the sun as the frontispiece to a scientific book on optics (Zucchi, Optica philosophia, 1652). 1 References in Thompson, p. 3. 2 E.g. in Vincent of Beauvais, Spec. nat., ed. 1624, pp. I176-78. 3 Paris, Bibl.

Two eagles in profile standing on hares are placed symmetrically on either side of the central group of eagle and snake, which appears in the frontal position with the body of the snake twisted (P1. 52e). 'Eagle on hare' is a symbol widely disseminated in the Old World, and it plays an important part in Christian thought.2 Just as the serpent stands for the devil, the hare stands for the quick course of human life.3 Since Christ vanquishes the devil, the sign of salvation can appear over the symbol of man. It is not always easy to determine how far the fight between eagle and snake has a symbolic significance. As long as it appears on the wall or the door of a church, as in Athens or Ochrida, the symbolic intention is evident : this is still the same apotropaic practice which induced the Egyptians to place the solar disk above their temples. But when we find the motive on the wooden box at Terracina4 where the eagle fighting a serpent appears in conjunction with all sorts of fighting animals, much of the magic power seems to have faded, and the symbol has become predominently decorative. The Graeco-Roman type as we know it from Greek coins, Roman tomb- stones, and other monuments has left its traces wherever Graeco-Roman civilisation penetrated. It advanced with Alexander to the East,5 we find it in Iran (P1. 50c) as well as in Syria (P1. 5ob), Egypt (P1. 52i) and Constan- tinople (P1. 511),6 it dominated in the Middle Ages in Italy, and in France it was fused with the hieratic eastern type. About the beginning of the second millenium of our era the symbol appears with ever growing frequency in Italy and France. The centre of its occurrence about 1200 in Italy is Apulia and Campania.7 We find it, for instance, on door frames of S. Nicola at Bari (P1. 52h), of the Cathedral at Benevento,8 of S. Giovanni at Brindisi, on the exterior of the Cathedral 1 Kondakov, Mace'doine (in Russian), I909, p. 231, P1. 3; Mufioz, L'Art byzantin, 19o6, fig. 144; Filow, Altbulgarische Kunst, i9I9, p. 35; Br6hier, op. cit., p. 81, P1. 43. 2The material is extremely rich and scattered and deserves a special treatment.

Io) saw an eagle-snake monument in the hippodrome, and an anonymous chronic- ler of the Ioth century A.D. describes a similar group before the bed-room of the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitos; he calls it a guard, a word which conveys its old magic destination of warding off evil.

It spreads to Central Italy where it occurs in Torriti's apsidal mosaic of S. Maria Maggiore in Rome (1295), on the pulpit of S. Maria in Araceli and above the porch of S. Lorenzo fuori le Mura; it is a feature of Abbruzzese pulpits of the I3th century,2 and can be found in the inlaid pavement of S. Miniato al Monte in Florence (13th century, P1. 52g). In all these cases the symbolic intention on the lines we discussed above is quite obvious.3 To mention one or two details of special interest : the representation in S. Nicola at Bari (P1. 52h), where an old and a young eagle defend themselves against the attack of a snake, is probably closely related to the passage from Deut. xxxII, i i commented upon again and again by Christian writers.4 In Torriti's mosaic, together with other symbolic emblems, it accompanies the central scene of the crowning of the Virgin by Christ. And in the inlaid floor of S. Miniato (P1. 52g) it takes up the central position between friezes of heraldic doves. The Physiologus5 mentions an Indian tree, called Peridexion, upon which dwell doves, feeding on its fruit. The dragon, the enemy of the doves, cannot approach this tree, but whenever a dove leaves the tree, he instantly devours it. The dove is man and the tree the symbol of the Trinity. As long as man lives under the shelter of belief in the fruits of the Holy Spirit, Satan is powerless. But once he turns to the ways of darkness, Satan is ready to kill him. This story is literally illustrated in the Florentine pavement. In each panel a pair of doves feed on the fruit of a three-branched tree and in the centre the act of salvation is shown : Christ in the shape of the eagle destroys Satan in the form of a snake. To support the meaning of the story-the victory of light over darkness- the eagle-Christ is accompanied by spoked wheels, a very old symbol for the sun. From the I I th century onwards the symbol appears in French Romanesque churches, mostly on capitals. A representation such as the one on a capital in the Museum at Nevers (P1. 52c)6 proves that the motive penetrated into France via Spain together with the general trend of the Hispano-Moresque influence. The eagles' bodies are given the same feather pattern as those of the Beatus MSS. The r6le of transmitter between Eastern prototypes and France played by the Umayyads in Spain can be illustrated by a Moorish sarcophagus with eagles preying on different animals7 exactly corresponding to Babylonian works of the 3rd and 2nd millenium B.C. and at the same time absolutely identical in type with the Nevers capital.

Croix at La Charit6-sur-Loire, of the church at Neuilly- en-Dun (Cher), of Notre Dame de Valkre at Sion, and at the tower of Saint- Martin-d'Ainy at Lyons.' From France and Italy the motive migrated to England and Germany. It occurs about I I8o on a capital in the crypt at Canterbury (P1. 52f), and its symbolical meaning is emphasised by placing it in the tympanum of the main door at Aston (Herefordshire) above the Agnus Dei.2 In Germany it can be found about I2oo at the porches of Grossenlinden(near Giessen)3 and on the porch of the churchyard at Remagen.4 In some of these examples, which could easily be multiplied, the symbol of eagle and snake forms part of a larger theological programme, but even when this is not the case the device always stands for Christ's triumph over Satan. This interpretation can be supported by the dependence of the French capitals on the Beatus MSS, which we have emphasised; for the Beatus illustrations are always accompanied by text which explicitly states that, for the salvation of men, Christ with his word, as with a strong beak, wiped out the poisonous malice of the old murderer of men.5 In the Beatus MSS the bird is not an eagle but a fabulous creature of the East. Occasionally it can be shown why another bird takes the place of the eagle. In a southern Italian marble slab of the 13th century a swan-like bird stands on an enormous snake.6 This seems to be the bird Caladrius, which cured illness by its gaze, according to the Physiologus.7 The bird which frequently occurs in mediaeval bestiaries and literatures is described as wholly white like the swan and with a long neck9 so that it could easily be represented in the form of a swan. Now a number of authors, amongst them Vincent of Beauvais, say that the Caladrius absorbs the disease into itself, and then flies up to the sun and there discharges the disease. The flight to the sun and the strength of the bird's eye are common to Cala- 1 Camille Martin, L'Art Roman en France, I9I0, I, Pls. 9, 6o, 67, II, P1. 34. F.

The motive of eagle and snake exists also in connection with St. John. Illustrations of the Gospel of St. John often introduce the Saint's eagle in the initial of the first chapter or as a tail piece at the end of the last chapter. It is rare, however, for the fight of eagle and snake to be depicted here. If it appears-and we know it as early as the 7th century in the Gospels of Valerianus' (P1. 52k) and in the 9th century in those of St. Louis2 (P1. 521)- it means that the word of St. John (symbolized by the victorious eagle) becomes the weapon by which the sin of the world (symbolized by the snake) is conquered. There was still another theological tradition which sponsored the representa- tion of Christ's victory over the forces of darkness in the form of the eagle vanquishing the serpent. It is based on Psalm 91, 13 : "Super aspidem et basiliscum ambulabis, et conculcabis leonem et draconem."3 The fight of the heavenly saviour against the monsters of darkness leads us back again to ideas which had been current in the Near East since the 3rd millenium B.C. This fight is also the central feature of the Iranian salvation mysteries and of Hellenistic mystery cults which deeply influenced early Christianity.4 The verse of the Psalm is often expounded by the Christian commentators,5 and we find pictorial interpretations on early Christian clay lamps, on sarco- phagi and later on Carolingian ivories.6 The examples in later times are very numerous, and Christ treading upon the snake is still a familiar subject in paintings of the I6th and I7th centuries (P1. 54a). Now, it is quite intelligible that the parallelism of Christ, sun and eagle holds good in the illustrations of this Psalm. For the persistency of this tradition we may quote a modern lectern in the Cathedral of Peterborough, where the eagle treads upon a serpent-like dragon, while on the shaft below are the words of the Psalm.7 4. Renaissance and Baroque The pagan revival of the Renaissance brought to the surface again old associations, but at the same time the symbol always retained its Christian significance, handed down from the Middle Ages. Accordingly a great variety of ideas are connected with the symbol. In the religious field a few examples must stand for the many cases in which it was used in a 1 H.

It appears in the I6th century in the pediment of the fagade of S. Francesco della Vigna in Venice, and in the late 15th century it is part of the decoration of Federighi's Holy water stoup in the Cathedral at Siena (P1. 53c), just as it recurs still in the 18th century on the baptismal font and on a carpet before the altar in St. Agricol at Avignon. As in the Middle Ages the eagle is occasionally replaced for special reasons by another bird. A Madonna by Giovanni Bellini may be quoted here (P1. 53a) where animals in the background are symbolically related to the central subject. Among these animals is the little group of a pelican fighting against a serpent. The pelican which nourished its young with its own blood became a symbol of self-sacrifice and charity and represents Christ like the eagle. Its struggle with the snake is quite unusual;' the special reason for its substitution for the eagle is the parallelism between the sacrifice of Christ and that of the pelican;2 for the sleeping child in the lap of the Madonna foreshadows the Pieta, and as the pelican vanquishes the snake, so the sacrificial death of Christ destroys Satan. This interpretation is proved by a Florentine engraving of the Quattrocento where the same group of pelican and snake appears above the Crucifix (P. 53b).3 Rubens employed the same symbol of pelican and serpent in a "Return from Egypt"4 and we can now safely say that it is also meant to foreshadow the slaying of Satan through the sacrifice of Christ.5 The device of foreshadowing a later event is, of course, not confined to sacred subjects. The Cavaliere d'Arpino in his frescoes illustrating Roman history in the Palazzo dei Conservatori in Rome employed the symbol as a good omen predicting victory as in ancient times. But most frequently the symbol occurs from the 16th century onwards in moralisations, some very far fetched, which were applied to ancient authors." Otto Vaenius in his Q. Horatii Flacci Emblemata (Antwerp, I607) shows the symbol of eagle and snake in a surprising context, for it appears as an allegorical interpretation 1 The story of the pelican first told in the Physiologus (cf. Lauchert, op. cit., p. 8) and endlessly repeated. There are even Physio- logus versions which speak of the enmity of pelican and snake. 2 According to the Physiologus the pelican is a simile for Christ's death on the cross. 3 A. Hind, Early Italian Engr., I938, AI, p. 39, P1. 31. The eagle alone, as well as eagle and snake, appears in ivories in connec- tion with the Crucifix as early as the i oth century. Cf. A. Goldschmidt, Elfenbein- skulpturen der karoling. Zeit I, P1. 23, No. 56, and Byzantinische Elfenbeine II, P1. I2, 32b, p. 34- 4 Rooses, L'Oeuvre de P. P. Rubens, 1886, I, No. 182, P1. 64. The composition is known in engravings by Vorsterman (dated I62o) and others. The picture was at Blenheim. It may here be mentioned that Titian made a drawing of eagles fighting with a dragon (original lost, formerly Bianconi Coll., Bologna, cf. Tietze, Tizian, 1936, p. 262). It seems not impossible that Titian would have placed the group in the background of a sacred picture. Cf. also the group in the background of his Baptism of Christ in the Museo Capitolino. 5 Cf. the occurence of the same symbol in Martin de Vos' engraving of Christ carrying the Cross (British Mus., Print Room I868- 6-I 2-383). A modern sculpture from Bali (P1. 54i) shows the struggle of pelican and serpent, perhaps under the influence of such Christian representations. 6The motive occurs in a drawing by Poussin (Louvre No. 32445) representing the 'Judgment of Paris' (?) apparently as a mor- alised illustration of the Homeric scene.</page><page sequence="35">53 a-Gio.

The eagle appears here as the embodiment of natural vigour and strength as opposed to the tenderness of doves. As the fight of eagle and snake is described in the beginning of the ode, the author, in order to display the eagle's fighting spirit, fell back on the old symbol of its struggle with the snake and placed it like a motto in the centre of his design (P1. 54d).2 Daniel Meissner, the author of one of these emblem books,3 went so far as to apply these moralisations to cities. An eagle is shown carrying off a dragon over the town of Coburg. The motto reveals that the eagle is a symbol of vigour and generosity. To this field of moralisation also belongs the adoption of the motive as a printer's mark. We find it as the symbol of victorious virtue with the printers Rovilli, de Gelmini (P1. 54c) and Thomas Laisn.&amp;4 And it is used on bookplates even to-day (P1. 54h).5 The old story from Aesop of the eagle which a reaper liberates from the grasp of a snake (cf. above p. 298) was also revived and interpreted afresh with regard to its moral teaching. Pierio Valeriano in his books on Hieroglyphics6 illustrates it as an example of Benignity (P1. 54e). This story gives at the same time an insight into the curious way in which antiquity acquired a new reality during the 16th century. In Lycosthenes' Encyclopedia of Miracles7 this story is related as an actual event with the date 272 B.C. It is true, these stories had a tremendous underground life and their grip on the popular mind was such that a sailor of the I6th century reported it as having happened on his voyage.8 The original cosmic event underlying the Babylonian Etana-myth, which had been already forgotten in Aesop's moralised animal tale, came to the surface again as a real adventure, although something of its miraculous quality was preserved by removing it into a distant country. In the field of folklore the traditional enmity between eagle and snake actually survives to-day. We find it in folk art9 and proverbs"0 and in fairy 1pp. 12-13. Horace's lines run: neque imbellem feroces progenerant aquilae columbam. This passage has become proverbial inFrance, Italy, Spain and Germany ("Adler brtiten keine Tauben"). Cf. W. Gottschalk, Die bildhaften Sprichwdrter der Riimer, 1935, I, p. 218. 2 In the foreground of the engraving a personification of Nature recommends a woman to Minerva. The woman symbolises Virtue.

In this connection a group from the Paris exhibition of 19oo may be mentioned which consisted of a huge cast-iron eagle crushing between its claws a dragon which clung to a rock (P1. 53i).~ Even the rock fits into the tradition which we have been tracing : it is the last appearance of the Mountain of the World, on which so many still more cosmic battles had been fought out in earlier mythologies. At the same time the device lives on in a purely decorative stage (P1. 53h, 54i).S But when it appears for instance as a doorknocker (Spital, Castel Porcia, P1. 53f)4 or in the form of two sculptural groups framing the entrance-door like guardians (P1. 53g)5 it still recalls the old apotropaic significance of the theme. During the Middle Ages the fight between eagle and snake was already used as a personal device and, significantly, we meet it with religious overtones on coins of priests such as Hughes de Pierrepont, Grand Prev6t de St. Lam- bert at Liege (1200-1229).6 Slightly later Clement IV adopted it as his emblem7 and the Christian allusion is unaltered in medals of Paul III (ca. I540)8 although a griffin replaces the eagle. When the symbol is placed in coats-of-arms its religious significance can sometimes still be grasped.9 In view of the traditional sun-nature of rulers, it is quite natural that the eagle's victory over the serpent should again play an important part in the symbolising of victory. The symbol is here transferred into the sphere of politics and applied to the divine ruler just as it had been in antiquity.10 But it has now in many cases acquired emblematical and allegorical qualities in- stead of apotropaic, for it appears to commemorate actual events and victories. Charles of Bourbon and Navarre had a medal struck with eagle and 1 For other fairy tales cf. Wolf, Deutsche Hausmdrchen, pp. I68 ff., I98 ff.

The same medal with the same motto was used for the Norwegian king Christian II.2 Henry III of France adopted the symbol when he celebrated the murder of his deadly enemy, Henry of Guise, the head of the League. The king appears in the motto as the representative of pious courage who vanquished the wicked (P1. 53d).3 The Emperor Rudolf II used the Austrian double eagle warding off snakes as a symbol for his defence of Christendom against the Turks,4 and an eagle attacking a dragon appears on a medal of the Doge Bertucci Valier after the Venetian victory against the Turks off the Dardanelles in I657.5 At the obsequies of Philip IV in 1665 the Jesuits erected an eagle tearing a serpent with its claws, because by his victory over his enemies Philip had achieved for his peoples what Christ had won for humanity by the victory over Satan.6 In more recent times the underlying religious note disappeared and the predominence of the political or the philosophical side of the symbol became absolute. In the Napoleonic era it became the emblem of the new empire (P1. 53e).7 But those who revolted against this empire did not revolt against the symbol :in 1913 the Prussians used it to celebrate the centenary of the insurrection against Napoleon. In the same sense the Greeks employed it to commemorate their victory in the Balkan war. The motive appears in the early 19th century with a philosophical meaning in Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell (p. 15, P1. 54g), where the eagle of genius and imagination carries aloft the unaspiring serpent.8 Shelley used it in the Revolt of Islam. But in a conscious reversal of the traditional meaning the snake becomes the symbol of the achievements of the French revolution as opposed to the reactionary forces of the Napoleonic era, of which the eagle was the symbol. Yet in an act of mythical recollection only attainable by the most exalted artistic intuition Shelley showed a clear perception of the cosmic grandeur of the symbol and of its universal significance in the history of mankind : when priests and kings dissemble In smiles or frowns their fierce disquietude; When round pure hearts a host of hopes assemble; The Snake and Eagle meet-the world's foundation tremble! 1 E.
