By far the larger share of the works then shown had been acquired by their owners in the decade preceding. One might with reason have assumed that another decade would pass before an assemblage of works of art of equal importance and interest could be brought together. Such, happily, is not the case. In the brief space of less than four years, again as many works of art have been acquired in St. Louis. Thus there is ample justification for the present exhibition. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that, if anything, the event is overdue. The exhibition of four years ago was devoted entirely to twentieth century art, to paintings, sculpture and drawings. To it was added, as the contribution of one collector, a remarkable group of African Negro sculptures in acknowledgment of the profound influence of that expression upon the art of our time. The work of St. Louis artists was not included for the simple reason that it is so frequently to be seen in the Museum in the continuing series of group shows and in the Missouri Annual exhibitions. The present exhibition is built along more comprehensive lines and it is more than twice as large. It could be as large again, but limitations of space preclude that. It embraces certain aspects of the art of the ancient Mediterranean world and the Orient, of the aboriginal cultures of the Americas, the Pacific and Africa, as well as the art of the last decades of the nineteenth century and of our own time. In consequence there is offered on this occasion a truer picture of the collecting habits of St. Louisans, their propensities, their enthusiasms. These habits of collecting form a fairly consistent pattern amongst a large number of people. It is quite apparent that for private pleasure in St. Louis today four great reservoirs of the world's art are tapped repeatedly. The first of these is modern art, European and American, including the work of the artists of this locality. Interest appears to be divided about equally amongst the three lesser categories: ancient art, aboriginal art and Oriental art. To speculate on how this pattern has developed would make an absorbing study, but such a many-sided problem is beyond the intention of this brief introduction. Suffice it to say that first and foremost, collectors are of necessity governed by the market, and the market in recent years has been rich in all the art that this exhibition represents. Modern art, of course, is in the process of creation, and an unfailing stream of contemporary works inevitably becomes available to local collectors. Aboriginal art, the esthetic appreciation of which dates back to the Fauves in Paris and the German Expressionists of Die Brücke in Dresden, is still being discovered in remote corners of the world and brought to western markets from the Pacific Islands, from Central and South America and Mexico, and from Africa. Of the small bronzes and ceramic art of [5]</page><page sequence="6">the ancient world the same may be said, nor has there been any shortage of Oriental art, especially in the field of Chinese ceramics and bronzes. In other words, in these fields there has been a market of abundance, not wanting in quality, providing the collector with an opportunity for selection and the exercise of discernment. But one may also take the opposite view and argue that the market has been well stocked in answer to a demand. True it is that the demand for modern art has been greatly accelerated in recent years as the popular reputation of the old leaders of the movement has grown and as new forms and new modes of expression have become accepted. And this development has a further significance in respect to contemporary collecting. Along with the acceptance of modern art has come an appreciation of the formalized and non-naturalistic art of remote cultures, cultures that created esthetic forms more compatible with modern art than those of the late Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the Baroque which were so eagerly sought after by collectors of previous generations. And so we may say that with one possible exception the direction St. Louis collecting has assumed in the mid-twentieth century has been governed by the rising interest in modern art. The exception is the field of Chinese ceramics. These objects possess the perennial appeal of a flower garden. Exquisite in color and form and infinitely varied, they enjoy a wide and certain popularity here regardless of changes in prevailing taste. In respect to modern masters, it is not without interest to observe for the moment and to record for the future the chief interests and enthusiasms of St. Louis collectors. Be it recorded then, that the masters of the School of Paris enjoy the widest favor. Not one of the foremost of them goes unrepresented in St. Louis, and of three of the greatest - Picasso, Braque and Rouault - there are important concentrations. Only less popular, though more recently sought after, are the masters of the modern German school. Again it is a trio of the group - Beckmann, Klee and Kirchner - that looms importantly amongst St. Louis collections. In respect to individual painters, an informal survey reveals that Picasso, both in point of time and number, remains of surpassing interest in this city. Some fifty-five paintings and drawings by the Spanish master are owned here privately. His position is challenged only by the late Max Beckmann, who is represented by no less than thirty-two works. Rouault, Braque, Klee and Kirchner are represented by a round dozen works by each, while Matisse and Chagall are only less popular with eight and seven paintings and drawings respectively. One-quarter of the modern works shown are by Americans, and one-quarter of these are by St. Louis artists. No single American has yet attained surpassing favor here, but seven of the foremost American painters of the present are represented in private collections by numerous examples. Of the Englishmen, there is multiple representation only of Moore and Piper. Worthy of note is the remarkable wealth of sculpture in miniature that has caught the fancy of the St. Louis collector in recent years. Principally bronzes of Asiatic origin - Luristan, Hittite, Ordos, Indian and Chinese - or of the ancient Mediterranean world, they are distinguished by their variety and high quality. As [6]</page><page sequence="7">their happy owners realize, these vest-pocket bronzes provide an enchanting museum of sculpture that any home could accommodate. It remains to be said that the private enjoyment of art in St. Louis is an uncommonly widespread pursuit. Most cities in America of similar size have two or three collections of real significance that are bywords in the art world. St. Louis has these. But peculiar to St. Louis are the many small collectors - people who would not lay claim to such a designation, but who at the same time would not care to live without the intimate companionship of works of art, chosen by them personally. That these same people are happy to share with the public their private enjoyment of much-loved possessions, distinguishes them in yet another admirable way. To them all the Museum makes grateful acknowledgment of their generosity and their kindness. Perry T. Rathbone. ■ÎS- « # This catalogue has been designed principally as a reference and as a record.
