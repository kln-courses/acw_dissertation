<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID KELMAN The Afterlife of Storytelling: Julio Cortâzar's Reading of Walter Benjamin and Edgar Allan Poe "They say that the most fervent desire of any ghost is to recover at least the appearance of its corporeality . . ." - Julio Cortâzar, "Some Aspects of the Short Story" AMONG THE MANY EVENTS that took place in Cuba following the 1959 Revolution was a seemingly insignificant literary gathering: a lecture by the Argentine writer Julio Cortâzar in Havana in 1963. In "Algunos aspectos del cuento" ("Some Aspects of the Short Story"), Cortâzar presented his theory of the short story in relation to various masters of the genre, such as Edgar Allan Poe, Franz Kafka, and Katherine Mansfield. While Cortâzar focused primarily on the structural characteristics of the best short stories, it is clear that in this lecture he was also setting out to define the political possibilities of telling a story in post- revolutionary Cuba. As Miguel Herrâez notes in his recent biography, although Cortâzar was never completely dedicated to the revolution in Cuba, he was never- theless infected with an enthusiastic desire to rethink the relation between litera- ture and politics (166). * Cortâzar's lecture, which was eventually published as an 1 Cortâzar confessed to Anton Arrufat that his passion for Cuba had reached a pathological level during this period: "Me he enfermado incurablemente de Cuba" ("I've become incurably sick with Cuba") (Cortâzar, qtd. in Herrâez 164). This incurable sickness pushed Cortâzar to reconsider the relation between writing and politics, especially in regards to the regime of General Perón during the late 1940s. Referring to this moment, Cortâzar notes: "[Después de] Ese contado con el pueblo cubano ... de golpe, sin que yo me diera cuenta (nunca fui consciente de todo eso) y ya en el camino de vuelta a Europa, vi que por primera vez yo habîa estado metido en pieno corazón de un pueblo que estaba haciendo su revolución, que estaba tratando de encontrar su camino. Y ése es el momento en que tendi los lazos mentales y en que me pregunté, o me dije, que yo no habfa tratado de entender el peronismo" ("[After] That contact with the Cuban people . . . suddenly, without realizing it [I was never conscious of all this] and already on my way back to Europe, I saw for the first time that I had been placed right in the heart of a people that was making its revolution, that was trying to find its way. And that is the moment when I extended my mental lassos and asked myself, or said to myself, that I had never tried to understand Peronism") (qtd. in Herrâez 168). Cortâzar's contact with the Cuban revolution became an event that not only opened up a new thinking about the political, but also suggested a way to relate the present moment (Cuba, 1963) to a moment in the past (the Per- onism of the 1940s-1950s), a moment that he had never fully understood. In this way, Cortâzar sug- gests a mode of historical reflection that seems related to Walter Benjamin's notion of the dialectical</page><page sequence="2">CORTÀZAR'S READING OF BENJAMIN &amp; POE / 245 essay, should therefore be seen as a deliberate attempt to intervene in the debate on the place of the work of art in the new polis or political community.2 Cortâzar's task, in his theory of the cuento, was to rethink this debate in terms of the possi- bilities and impossibilities of storytelling.3 For Cortâzar, the political efficacy of the short story lies not in its content, but rather in the particular effect, or jolt, transmitted by means of its form. Cortâzar builds this theory out of a reading of two important precursors: Edgar Allan Poe and Walter Benjamin. In what follows, I examine Cortâzar's relation to these two theorists of the short story in order to measure the impact of his theoretical inter- vention into discussions of what it means to build a political community through storytelling. As we will see, Cortâzar uses Benjamin and Poe in order to develop a theory of "artificial" storytelling, a mode of telling a story after traditional story- telling is no longer possible. For Cortâzar, this new mode of storytelling - which he calls the cuento or short story - produces a shock that dislodges the reader from the everyday world. At the same time, however, Cortâzar insists that the form of the cuento functions as a kind of artificial respiration for the reader: the cuento pro- duces artificial experience so that the reader may live on in an age when experi- ence is in decay. The afterlife of story telling therefore points to the possibility of a new political community that is not predicated on the full presence of the people, but rather on the transmission of a story. Politics can then be said to take place as the event of a transmission, and it is the function of the modern storyteller to tell stories that are able to produce this kind of event. The Fall of Storytelling By alluding to the decay of experience, I am already suggesting that Cortâzar's essay is in some sense indebted to the theories of Walter Benjamin. After all, in the German theorist's essays from the 1930s, Benjamin insists that the defining trait of modernity is the way experience has fallen in value. This inability to pro- duce true experience can be seen in a number of symptoms: the lack of interest in lyric poetry, the liquidation of tradition and its representation as ruin, the image, especially Benjamin's emphasis on the sudden emergence of the past as an image that flashes up in a moment of recognizability (Benjamin, "Concept" 390). A more sustained meditation on the historiographical method of Benjamin and Cortâzar will have to wait for another occasion. 2 For two recent discussions of Cortâzar's politics and the figure of politics in Cortâzar's work, see Levinson and Colas. Levinson provides a brilliant reading of "Casa tomada" (House Taken Over) and shows the impossibility of choosing between an aesthetic and a political reading of Cortâzar's short story: "The choice between the two, indeed, is no choice since the claim to one, uncannily, must call upon its opposite as an alternative foundation that displaces and decenters it" (108). If Levinson focuses on the impossibility of choosing aesthetics over politics, or vice versa, Colâs's essay attempts to understand the performative dimension of Cortâzar's poetics as a form of the political. Colas sug- gests that, for Cortâzar, "invention" is the "immanent, creative reconfiguration of the relations mak- ing up the fabric of our lives and our society in such a way as would free up the true potency of the human subject" (31). Although my reading is indebted to these two attempts to read the figure of politics in Cortâzar, I argue that it is necessary to emphasize storytelling as a practice that produces political effects. For that reason, I focus on the Argentine writer's narrative theory in its relation to Walter Benjamin's attempt to understand the political significance of storytelling. 3 All translations from Cortâzar's essays are mine. For clarity's sake (and to differentiate between real story" and "short story"), I will often use the Spanish term cuento to refer to the form of the short story.</page><page sequence="3">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 246 decay of the aura of works of art, and the inability to tell a story. As I will argue, Cortâzar takes the decay of experience as a starting point for his own theory of storytelling. Strangely, however, Cortâzar never refers explicitly to Benjamin, although he is clearly familiar with Benjamin's heirs, such as Theodor Adorno (after all, "Teodoro W. Adorno" was the name of Cortâzar's famous cat). Rather, Benjamin stands as something of a hidden figure in Cortâzar's texts; his work on narrative, photography, cinema, and politics always seems to be hovering in the background of Cortâzar's writings. Whether or not Cortâzar actually read Benjamin is for the moment irrelevant, since what matters is the way Cortâzar's theory of storytelling sets up a relation of reading with Benjamin's theory of storytelling. In other words, the relationship between Benjamin and Cortâzar is not based on influence or on a phenomenal act of reading, but rather on what Paul de Man calls "a process of translation or 'transport' that incessantly circulates between the two texts" (De Man 260). If there is no "natural" relationship between the two texts, it therefore follows that any attempt to link Benjamin and Cortâzar must focus primarily on the comparability of the two texts, since this comparability can never be taken for granted.4 My task, then, is to show that Cortâzar's essay in effect reads Benjamin's theory of storytell- ing. This means that it is not sufficient merely to give a summary of Benjamin's thought in his 1936 essay on storytelling, since a summary would necessarily gloss over the crucial figures that Benjamin uses to develop his argument. Rather, I will take the time to focus on those figures in Benjamin's essay that will be most impor- tant for Cortâzar's argument. I will then examine the way Cortâzar's theory figures and disfigures Benjamin's image of storytelling. The debate on storytelling can be said to have taken an important turn in Walter Benjamin's essay "The Storyteller: Observations on the Works of Nikolai Leskov." Although written as a review of Leskov's stories, this 1936 essay medi- tates more generally on the future of storytelling and its relation to tradition, mem- ory, and experience. As one of the last traditional storytellers, Leskov is important because his presence highlights the loss of storytelling in the modern age. This loss, Benjamin maintains, is due to the decay of experience: because modern individuals have no experiences to share, traditional storytelling also falls in value. Therefore, Benjamin seeks to distinguish traditional storytelling from the mod- ern forms of storytelling that have taken its place. Although Benjamin's primary concern is to differentiate this more traditional mode of storytelling (or "real story") from the novel, his essay also attacks another modern genre: the short story. In fact, Benjamin's denigration of the short story ends up casting a nega- tive light by which it is possible to read his theory of storytelling in general. At the 4 Benjamin himself focuses on the question of comparability in his early essay on two poems by Hölderlin. Although Hölderlin's two poems would seem to be related by the mere fact that they are attached to the same proper name ("Hölderlin"), Benjamin does not take this "natural" relation at face value. Rather, he insists that any reading of the relation between the two poems must also show how this comparison is possible: "The method will demonstrate that the poems are comparable. A certain relationship connects them, so that one could speak of different versions" (Benjamin, "Hölder- lin" 21). For an excellent example of how Benjamin's notion of comparability can be applied to con- temporary efforts to rethink comparative literature and comparative cultural studies, see Gil Anidjar's "Our Place in al-AndalusT In La insubordination de los signos, Nelly Richard emphasizes this Benjaminian notion of comparison, when she insists that one can read the impact of Benjamin's thought in the work of Chilean intellectuals, even if the latter do not make any clear references to Benjamin's texts.</page><page sequence="4">CORTÂZAR'S READING OF BENJAMIN 8c POE / 247 same time, it is precisely Benjamin's negative definition of the short story that becomes a field of intervention for Cortâzar. Benjamin's denigration of the short story is always placed in relation to the pass- ing away of the storyteller. This argument about the loss of storytelling is not sim- ply a nostalgic yearning for older forms and figures.5 Rather, Benjamin insists that traditional storytelling is essential to the notion of community, since it is the func- tion of the storyteller to impart wisdom that comes from afar (that is, tradition). If this ability to transmit traditional experience (Erfahrung, in German) is in decay, then everything else that depends on this transmission - community, history, tra- ditional forms of politics - must also be included in this story of loss: "It is as if a capability that seemed inalienable to us, the securest among our possessions, has been taken from us: the ability to share experiences [Erfahrungen]" ("Storyteller" 143; Gesammelte Schriften 2:439). Experience or Erfahrung does not simply mean that which one has lived through in any particular moment (Erlebnis, in German). Rather, Erfahrung is the kind of experience that is built up through tradition. Expe- rience, in this sense, takes place only in relation to a larger community; its condition is that there must be this communal environment - both spatial and temporal - within which experience can be shared.6 Modernity has interrupted this relation to tradition; as a result, Benjamin writes, "experience has fallen in value [die Erfahr- ung ist im Kurse gefallen] " ("Story teller" 143; Gesammelte Schriften 2: 439). Although Benjamin is clearly using an economic metaphor here, as if experience were a 5 In this sense, Benjamin's essay stands within a tradition that studies the passing away of "epic" forms. Like Georg Lukâcs in his The Theory of the Novel, Benjamin understands the development of forms as a process that cannot be separated from "the given historico-philosophical realities with which the authors were confronted" (Lukâcs 56). However, if Lukâcs's theory is nostalgic about the loss of an epic form in a new historical age, Benjamin's account is precisely not nostalgic, even if he still emphasizes loss and disappearance. As Irving Wohlfarth remarks, it is only "because [the story- teller] is vanishing that the storyteller's beauty is now so significantly enhanced" (1003). For Benja- min, then, the beauty of the storyteller does not lie within a lost past. Rather his disappearance in the present historical moment is what makes this figure - and the group of concepts with which he is associated - take on a strange beauty. The storyteller is only significant insofar as he has turned into a figure, that is, a trope that signifies something absent. The storyteller therefore becomes legible as a figure only when the presence of the storyteller has disappeared irrevocably. It is worth mentioning here that, in Benjamin's hands, the fate of the storyteller is linked to the fate of historiography. See Wohlfarth and Bahti (especially "Nietzsche's Ursprünge, Lukâcs's Leaps" and "Death and Authority: Benjamin's 'The Storyteller'"). As opposed to Wohlfarth, Bahti empha- sizes the importance of the storyteller's gradual disappearance, or more precisely, his withdrawal - the way the storyteller is becoming ever more remote (weiter noch sich Entfernendes): "this nonpresence, Benjamin's precision indicates, is not yet an absence; rather, it is a distancing, a withdrawing, a present participial absenting" (227). Bahti insists that what is presented in Benjamin's essay is "[t]he story of storytelling's becoming history - ending, passing away ..." (232). Therefore, storytelling becomes his- toriography precisely in the gradual disappearance of the storyteller. 6 In his "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire," Benjamin discusses his theory of experience in relation to Freud's theory of unconscious traces and the buffering role of consciousness. For a clear account of Benjamin's use of Freud, see Marder: "According to Benjamin, it is Erfahrung, 'experience,' that gives us a sense of community: we become bound to one another through the shared experiences which are transmitted through unconscious memory traces. By contrast, the preserved bits and shards of lived moments - Erlebnis - are severed from any form of commonality or sense of dura- tion. Since they are preserved in time but remain devoid of temporal duration, these 'souvenirs' or 'conscious memories' ultimately engulf the life of the speaker and transform him into a walking graveyard - a lonely witness who, by becoming the conscious repository for what once was but is no longer, loses his capacity to live in time" (93). Because Benjamin continually links the problem of experience to questions of time, history, and community, it becomes necessary to rethink politics from the perspective of this crisis of experience.</page><page sequence="5">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 248 commodity that has now declined in value, he also suggests that the decline in the value of experience takes place as a literal fall; indeed, "it looks as if it may fall into bottomlessness [ins Bodenlose] . Every glance at a newspaper shows that it has reached a new low [einen neuen Tiefstand]" (143; 2:448). The inability to share experiences produces a change in the very structure of experience: instead of expe- riencing a relation to tradition and community, the modern subject experiences the phenomenon of an endless fall. The importance of this figure of falling can- not be overemphasized, since it becomes a crucial motif in Cortâzar's own attempt to theorize the unique effect of the short story. Benjamin insists that this change in the structure of experience manifests itself as, among other things, the atrophy of older notions of relation. For instance, in "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire," Benjamin, playing on the double sense of the word, employs the Latin-derived Relation to refer both to a connection (a more typical word choice would be Beziehung or Verhältnis) and to narration (a more typi- cal word choice would be Erzählung) . In thinking about the change in the struc- ture of experience, Benjamin finds that "the increasing wasting away of expe- rience is reflected in the loosening [Ablösung] of the older relation [Relation] by means of information, of information by means of sensation" {Gesammelte Schriften 1:611, my translation). I will return to the role of information in a moment; for now it is important to focus on the way new modes of communication are not only affecting the way stories are being told ("narration" in Harry Zohn's translation), but are also loosening up the older relations that once connected the individual to tradition. It can be said, then, that the atrophy of experience in modernity is reflected in this loosening up of relations, which has a further reverberation in the ability to tell stories. The atrophy of relation, Benjamin suggests, affects an indi- vidual's linguistic relation to others in the form of the story. Thus the crisis of expe- rience also produces a crisis in the very ability to tell stories (or "share experi- ences"). Released from the support of this network of stories, the subject falls into the endless vertigo of modernity. The modern age is thus marked, Benjamin notes in his later essay on Baude- laire, by the experience of shock. This "shock-experience" (Chockerlebnis) is not just something that happens to people while walking along city streets ("Motifs" 329). More importantly for the present argument, new modes of communication, such as the narrative techniques of newspapers or the more modern technology of the cinema,7 also produce in the viewer or reader a kind of shock-experience through the instantaneous transmission of information. 7 Unfortunately, the scope of this article does not allow a discussion of the way film, as a new medium of communication, introduces the shock experience. However, the argument that Benja- min makes about film is roughly analogous to the argument he makes about the new narrative techniques of the newspaper. As he notes in his essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Its Techno- logical Reproducibility," "[i]t is through the camera that we first discover the optical unconscious, just as we discover the instinctual unconscious through psychoanalysis" (266). In this essay, he also argues that cinema liquidizes tradition and at the same time introduces a new way to view the world and, therefore, new possibilities for a political intervention. He writes: "It thus becomes violently clear [So wird handgreiflich] that another nature [eine andere Natur] speaks [spricht] to the cam- era than to the eyes" (Gesammelte Schriften 1:500; my translation). Cinema is a new form of commu- nication precisely to the extent that it allows nature itself to speak in a new way: it presents some- thing other to the eyes. Although Benjamin does not pursue this kind of argument explicitly in "The Storyteller," it is implied in the way he describes the force of information. As we will see, Cortâzar suggests in a more explicit way what Benjamin only intimates in his essay on Leskov.</page><page sequence="6">CORTÂZAR'S READING OF BENJAMIN 8c POE / 249 In part, the shock of information is due to its abbreviated nature: it comes quickly and intensely, like an event. As Benjamin explains in his essay on Baude- laire, the purpose of information is "to transmit the pure 'in itself of the event [zu übermitteln . . . das pure An-sich des Geschehenen]" (Gesammelte Schriften 1:611; my translation) . Without the advantage of any kind of mediation, information sim- ply arrives and forces itself upon the receiver. Although it is supposed to present facts, what it transmits are not facts but rather the effect of shock. This process is completely opposed to what happens in the situation of storytelling. The story- teller, Benjamin insists, cushions the event and "submerges the thing into the life of the storyteller" ("Storyteller" 149). For this reason, a "real story" is one that is thoroughly connected not only to tradition but also to the very life of the one who is telling the tale. Because of the generalized abbreviating processes of modern life, however, these kinds of connections are cut short by information. Although the modern novel clearly exemplifies this shift to information, the short story provides an even better literary example of the abbreviated nature of modern life. For Benjamin, the short story is not simply one mode of storytell- ing among others; rather, it is a foreign genre, an alien usurper that only serves to highlight the fact that storytelling is in the process of passing away. The for- eignness of the short story is immediately evident in Benjamin's German, since he refers to this modern genre by using the English short story rather than the Ger- man term Erzählung. In this way, the flow of Benjamin's German is interrupted and cut short by the English phrase. Instead of calling attention to the enumera- tive process of recounting that is apparent in German (Er-zählung) ,8 Benjamin suggests that the operative word here is the instantaneous short - the abbreviation or abkürzen of story telling (Gesammelte Schriften 2:448). Building on Valéry's com- ment that "man no longer works at what cannot be abbreviated," Benjamin writes: "In point of fact, [the modern subject] has succeeded in abbreviating even story- telling. We have witnessed [erlebt] the evolution of the 'short story', which has removed itself from oral tradition and no longer permits that slow piling up, one on top of the other, of thin, transparent layers which constitutes the most appro- priate image of the way in which the perfect narrative [die vollkommene Erzäh- lung] is revealed through the layers of various retellings [vielfacher Nacherzäh- lungen]" ("Storyteller" 150; Gesammelte Schriften 2:448). The short story therefore cannot be an Erzählung, if only because it does not permit the countless retellings that constitute the form of storytelling in the first place. After all, the condition that allows a story to exist is precisely the way a story gets repeated from storyteller to storyteller. These countless retellings in effect define the story as such. A "real story" happens only as an accumulative process through which the story can arrive at its fulfillment over time. As Benjamin notes, these multiple after-stories (viel- facher Nacherzählungen) allow a story to arrive at its fulfilled completion: die vollkom- mene Erzählung. The accumulation process also means that a "real story" only fully 8 In German, "to count" is expressed by the verb zählen, while "to tell a story" is, of course, erzählen. Cf. Borges on the etymological relation between telling a story and counting or enumerating: "no deja de ser significativo que hablemos de contar un cuento y de contar hasta mil. Todos los idiomas que conozco usan el mismo verbo, o verbos de la misma raiz, para los actos de narrar y de enu- merar" ("It's significant that we speak of telling a story and counting to a thousand. All the languages I know use the same verb, or verbs of the same root, for the acts of narrating and enumerating") (Borges, "Nombres" 256).</page><page sequence="7">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 250 comes into its own when its origin has been displaced and its authority dispersed through a number of storytellers. No story can truly exist without these "various retellings" or "afterstories." However, these afterstories are increasingly becoming a thing of the past. Benja- min explains that, in the modern age, " [w] e have witnessed [erlebt] the evolution of the 'short story'" ("Storyteller" 150; Gesammelte Schriften 2:448). In other words, in the modern age the only thing that remains is something we have lived through, erlebt, but not fully experienced: the beginning of the abbreviation of storytelling and the subsequent development of the "short story." The short story arrives simply as an event, just as information in the modern age hits the subject without cushion- ing the event within layers of tradition. The "eventness" of the short story, which is equivalent to the way information transmits the pure "in itself" of the event, is completely opposed to the way the "real story" is transmitted. Unlike traditional storytelling, which "submerges the subject matter into the life of the storyteller" (149; translation modified), the short story forces itself upon the receiver and pro- duces a shock. Previously, it had been the function of art to transform these sud- den experiences {Erlebnisse) of life into an experience {Erfahrung) that expresses a temporal continuity and a link to the collective unconscious.9 This transformation is necessary because Erlebnis - instantaneous, lived experience - does not accu- mulate and therefore cannot enter as such into a collective experience. For that reason, Benjamin insists that the primary function of a "real story" is its ability to transform Erlebnis into Erfahrung by weaving "counsel" into the fabric of real life, gelebten Lebens, life as it is lived {Gesammelte Schriften 442). In the modern age, however, the conditions that define the true story - this "weave" of Erlebnis and Erfahrung - have become impossible. We no longer have access to this ability to weave counsel into life as it is lived, and the storyteller is no longer able to convey the accumulation of "afterstories" that have been built up over centuries. However, the impossibility of storytelling does not mean that stories are no longer being told, only that the act of storytelling has undergone a transforma- tion in the form of the short story. Rather than the accumulation of afterstories, the short story presents the afterlife of storytelling. The condition of this new mode of telling a story is modern-day experience, that is, the experience of the pure event that shocks and disturbs. The "short story," then, is the narrative form that takes the shock-Erlebnis as its basis. Artificial Erfahrung If, after its decline, storytelling lives on in the form of the short story, what is the function of this form? Is the short story merely a substitute for the lost art of story- telling, or does it rather reconfigure what it means to tell a story in the first place? 9 In his Truth and Method, Hans-Georg Gadamer reviews this function of art when speaking of the history of aesthetics during the nineteenth century and early part of the twentieth century. An aesthetic experience, properly defined, would be one that takes Erlebnis as its basis and relates this momentary experience to the totality of life. Because the Erlebnis is "an adventure," the power of the Erlebniskunst (art based on experience) is that it "suddenly tears the person experiencing it out of the context of his life, and yet relates him back to the whole of his existence" (Gadamer 70). It is precisely the second moment of this process - the moment of relating the subject to a whole - that Benjamin says is increasingly threatened by the new forms of communication such as information.</page><page sequence="8">CORTÄZAR'S READING OF BENJAMIN 8c POE / 251 In effect, these are the questions that Julio Cortâzar poses in his theory of the short story. This theory is developed not only in "Some Aspects of the Short Story," but also in Cortâzar 's introduction to his translation of Edgar Allan Poe's stories and critical writings. Therefore, before turning to the essay presented in Cuba, I will first begin with Cortâzar's translation of Poe in two senses - Cortâzar 's literal translation of Poe's works and his more general translation of Poe's theory of the short story. Although Cortâzar does not refer to Benjamin explicitly in his transla- tion of Poe, he presents nevertheless an image of the story when storytelling is no longer possible. In fact, the figure of Poe is critical here precisely to the extent that Poe's tales stand as both exemplary "real stories" for Benjamin and as models of the modern short story for Cortâzar. On the one hand, Poe is, according to Benjamin, the story- teller who exudes an incomparable atmosphere, like Leskov or Stevenson ("Story- teller" 162). On the other hand, Cortâzar includes Poe within a litany of modern writers that extends from Tolstoy and Hemingway to Borges and Truman Capote ("Cuento" 375) . Is Poe a traditional storyteller, or is he a modern short story writer? To a certain extent, one could say of Poe's short stories what Benjamin once said about Baudelaire's lyric poetry. If Baudelaire exhausted the tradition of lyric poetry by including motifs in his poems that forcefully made lyric poetry impossible,10 Poe bases his stories on conditions that make the storyteller's craft impossible. Thus, whereas Benjamin notes that Poe's way of transmitting experience is in the form of the hermetic tradition, thereby providing access to the hidden depths of archaic Erfahrung ("Storyteller" 157), Cortâzar's emphasis on the transmission of an event reveals the way Poe's work systematically undermines this link to tradi- tion. Better than anyone else, Cortâzar understands the peculiarly modern effect of Poe's short stories - that is, their detachment from tradition. In fact, Cortâzar's reading of Poe eventually forms the basis of his own theory of the modern cuento (the short story, or what Poe calls "the prose tale"). Cortâzar begins his reading of Poe with an overview of Poe's explicit statements concerning the prose tale. These statements appear in a review of the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne from the May 1842 volume of Graham's Magazine. The review is important for Cortâzar because in it Poe insists that every short story should transmit an event or what Poe calls the "effect" of the tale: A skilful literary artist has constructed a tale. If wise, he has not fashioned his thoughts to accommo- date his incidents; but having conceived, with deliberate care, a certain unique or single effect to be wrought out, he then invents such incidents - he then combines such events as may best aid him in establishing this preconceived effect. If his very initial sentence tends not to the out-bringing of this effect, then he has failed in his first step. In the whole composition there should be no word written, of which the tendency, direct or indirect, is not to the one pre-established design. (Poe 572) 10 Cf. Benjamin, "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire": "Les Fleurs du mal was the last lyric work that had a broad European reception; no later writings penetrated beyond a more or less limited linguistic area. Added to this is the fact that Baudelaire expended his productive capacity almost entirely on this one volume. And finally, it cannot be denied that some of his motifs . . . render the possibility of lyric poetry problematic. These three facts define Baudelaire historically" (341-42). For this reason, Benjamin calls Baudelaire "a star without atmosphere"; Baudelaire is the image of the lyric poet who has lost his aura (343). For a reading of the motif of the lost firmament in Baudelaire, see Elissa Marder 's "Women Tell Time: Traumatic and Addictive Temporality in Les Fleurs du mal" in Dead Time. For a reading of the motif of "a star without atmosphere" and its relation to the "actuality" of the lyric poet, see my "The Inactuality of Aura: Figurai Relations in Walter Benjamin's 'On Some Motifs in Baudelaire.'" For a reading of the idea of "the decay of the aura," see Weber.</page><page sequence="9">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 252 Poe links this effect to an "originality" or "novelty" that "tasks and startles the intellect, and so brings into undue action the faculties to which, in the lighter lit- erature, we least appeal" (Poe 580). Because, according to Poe, the tale arrests the reader with its startling effect, its reception is highly conscious, too conscious, perhaps, for a traditional story as defined by Benjamin. After all, the proper state for receiving a traditional story, Benjamin insists, is "a state of relaxation" such as one finds in the rhythmic boredom of artisanal work: "The more self-forgetful the listener is, the more deeply what he listens to is impressed upon his memory. When the rhythm of work has seized him, he listens to the tales in such a way that the gift of retelling them comes to him all by itself" ("Storyteller" 149) . Against this image of storytelling, Poe introduces the image of the startled reader, whose intellect is brought into play by the novel effect of the tale. This unique and preconceived "effect" need not be a magical or otherwise strange occurrence; after all, tradi- tional stories, especially fairy tales, are full of such magic. But it must press upon and shock the intellect of the reader. To these theories, Cortâzar adds some observations of his own, based on a read- ing of Poe's tales. "[Poe] understood that the efficacy of a tale depends on its inten- sity as pure event [su intensidad corno acaecimiento puro]n ("Poe" 34), he writes, sug- gesting that the point of a short story is not merely the realization of an indefinite effect, but the transmission of a pure event - or rather, a pure and intense event. As we have seen, this reference to the pure "in itself" of the event is precisely the way Benjamin describes the essence of information in the "Storyteller" essay. Cor- tâzar therefore follows closely Benjamin's definition of the informational force of the short story. Far from pretending to describe the more traditional form of story- telling, Cortâzar focuses on this modern, abbreviated form, divorced from the layers of oral tradition. In this way, even though Cortâzar's essay focuses on Poe's theory of the tale, he is in effect responding to Benjamin's comments on the mod- ern short story. In fact, we will see that Cortâzar's theory develops some of Benja- min's insights from his other essays - most notably, "The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility" - and applies them to a theorization of the modern short story. For Cortâzar, then, the short story transmits a pure event. However, the word he uses for "event" is not suceso, which is one way of talking about a "happening" in Spanish, but acaecimiento. While acaecimiento also means "an event or happen- ing," it is perhaps best translated as a "befalling," since the verb "to fall" stands at the heart of the Spanish word {caer, "to fall," from which is derived the verb acae- cer, "to befall," "to happen"). The transmission of a pure event is therefore also the transmission of a pure fall or the happening of a fall. By focusing on the short story in his reading of Poe and in his later essay "Some Aspects of the Short Story," Cortâzar is in fact asking: What does it mean to transmit the event of fall- ing, the event of a befalling, or even the event of an event? What is the effect of this transmission? To answer these questions, it is necessary to look more closely at how Cortâzar employs this word acaecimiento. At first, it might seem that Cortâzar is in fact translating a central element in many of Poe's short stories: the experience of falling. What else does Poe describe in his tales but that uncertain reference to falling, descending, or decaying? What else does he enumerate but a long list</page><page sequence="10">CORTAZAR'S READING OF BENJAMIN &amp; POE / 253 of cases, incidents, and accidents, all words that somehow translate the experience of falling?11 However, this conclusion fails to take into account what Cortâzar means by the "event," or the "event of falling." He qualifies his use of the word acaecimiento by saying that the tale need not contain exciting events. Here he uses the other word for event, suceso: "when speaking of 'intensity', it should not be understood that the short story ought to contain events that are wildly intense [sucesos desaforadamente intensos]" (35). The spectacular or excessive suceso is not the same as the acaecimiento, the event (of falling). The event that Cortâzar cares about is not on the order of a spectacle. For instance, it might happen that a man feels the need to confess a crime and indeed confesses. This non-spectacular happening is the acaecimiento, the event. In fact, Cortâzar talks about the event more as a situation or circumstance (circunstancia) than as the revelation of some kind of spectacular instant (36) .12 In his 1963 lecture in Havana, "Some Aspects of the Short Story," Cortâzar returns to this topic in a more general way and develops what he means by the "event" or acaecimiento of the short story. Rather than a concentrated reading of one particular author, in this essay Cortâzar develops his argument from a sus- tained comparison between photography and the short story.13 The point of this comparison is not to assimilate the short story to new media like photography, but rather to suggest that both photography and the short story are conditioned by the modern experience of shock. In the first place, Cortâzar notes that, like the photographer, the short story writer must focus on an abbreviated image and fix this fragment through determinable limits. This process of delimitation or abbreviation succeeds or fails according to the precision with which the artist is able "to cut out a fragment of reality [recortar un fragmento de la realidad]" ("Cuento" 371). Both photography and the short story belong to this history of cutting, of the recorte (371). In this way, Cortâzar mobilizes Benjamin's rhetoric of abbreviation - the abkürzen of storytelling - in order to talk about the short story as part of a generalized techne that fragments reality as part of its organiz- ing principle. Therefore, if Benjamin's essay gestured towards the storyteller as a figure of the past, Cortâzar focuses on a shift in techniques of representation. Of course, Benjamin had already reviewed these new techniques in his essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility." For Benja- min, these techniques - including the "technique" of information - bear witness to a generalized historical process: "the desire of the present-day masses to 'get closer' to things . . . Every day the urge grows stronger to get hold of an object at 11 All of these words (decay, case, incident, accident) in some way relate etymologically to the word cadere, to fall. 12 By denning the acaecimiento in this way, Cortâzar might have had in mind Henry James's defini- tion of an "incident" in "The Art of Fiction": "When a young man makes up his mind that he has not faith enough after all to enter the church as he intended, that is an incident ... I do not say that these are extraordinary or startling incidents" (James 583). 13 For an early account of Cortâzar's use of the rhetoric of photography in describing the short story, see Lopez de Martinez. Oddly, Lopez de Martinez misquotes Cortâzar's explicit statement about the event-ness of the short story, by using the word acontecimiento instead of acaecimiento (567) . Of course, both words refer etymologically to ad-cadere, but Cortâzar's choice places the verb caer more visibly at the center of the word. For a reading of the importance of photography in Cor- tâzar's illustrated essay collections Ultimo round and La vuelta al dia en ochenta mundos, see Russek.</page><page sequence="11">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 254 close range in an image" (255). The desire of the masses is precisely to bring things nearer, näherzubringen, to break things off from their context, and to pre- sent reality as an image {Gesammelte Schriften 1:479). Cortâzar similarly focuses on this generalized condition and notes that both photography and the short story can be valued precisely by determining the impact of the recorte.14 It is at this point that Cortâzar's comparison between photography and the short story in the lecture rejoins his reading of Poe's theory of the tale. After noting that the techniques of both arts entail a close-up of reality, Cortâzar goes on to say: "the photographer and the short story writer are forced [se ven precisa- dos] to choose and delimit an image or an event [una imagen o un acaecimiento] that is significant, that is not only valuable in itself but that is able to act upon the spectator or reader as a kind of aperture [apertura]" ("Cuento," 371). According to Cortâzar, the photographer and the short story writer do not have a choice in the matter: this delimitation or abbreviation of reality is the condition for their art, and they are forced to focus on a significant event that is cut off from its context. Furthermore, as Poe's theory of the tale maintains, the purpose of the short story is the production of a unique effect. Cortâzar again uses the rhetoric of photography to describe this effect: the intense close-up that con- ditions photography and the short story produces an apertura. Here, Cortâzar refers to the opening on a camera to describe both the effect of the photograph on the viewer and the effect of the short story on the reader. This effect is a shock: through the opening created by the recorte, a force similar to light hits and exposes the reader, creating the event or acaecimiento that befalls the reader of the short story. In fact, Cortâzar thinks of this event as akin to a "knockout" in boxing ("Cuento" 372), and it is worth noting that, as in Benjamin's essay, English is again the lan- guage that marks the strange difference that the short story makes. Whereas the novel wears the reader out through an accumulation of light blows, the short story is "incisive, biting, merciless from the very first sentences" ("Cuento" 372). The short story writer must know how to produce a quick effect, because, unlike Benjamin's "real story," "the short story writer knows that he cannot proceed through accumulation; time is not his ally" ("Cuento" 372). Furthermore, as the violence of the word knockout suggests, the purpose of the short story is not to cushion the reader from the effect of the story. The short story does not trans- mit wisdom to the reader and does not allow the reader to tell a story in turn, thus cutting off the possibility of "afterstories." In fact, after the knockout, the reader is not in a position to say anything. The "unique effect" of the short story therefore exposes the reader to the aperture of the camera in two senses. On the one hand, the short story produces an image of its reader, just as the aper- ture of the photographic apparatus takes a picture of the subject. On the other hand, the "unique effect" of the short story produces an aperture or trauma in the reader: it knocks out and fixes the reader in a frozen image of petrified unrest. What befalls the reader is the inability to retell the event of the fall that marks the 14 As Lindsay Waters suggests, there is a good chance that Cortâzar read Pierre Klossowski's (abbreviated) French translation of Benjamin's "Work of Art" while living in Paris in the 1950s (139).</page><page sequence="12">CORTÄZAR'S READING OF BENJAMIN &amp; POE / 255 unique effect of the short story. The acaecimiento of the short story thus also trig- gers the reader's fall into silence.15 It is now possible to see how Cortâzar's theory resonates with Benjamin's theory of the atrophy of experience in modernity. For Benjamin, experience in the mod- ern age has fallen in value, a fall that is in turn experienced by the modern subject as an endless fall: every glance at a newspaper, for example, transmits this experi- ence {Erlebnis) of the fall of experience (Erfahrung). As a result, the modern sub- ject is no longer cushioned by the network of traditional stories. Without this web of stories, the subject falls away from any notion of community or tradition, and quite literally falls into silence. It is precisely this experience of falling into silence that Cortâzar theorizes as the central effect of a cuento. Following Benjamin, Cor- tâzar insists that the condition of the short story is its very brevity: the cuento is the abkürzen or recorte - the cutting short - of traditional storytelling, and for that rea- son transmits the shock of an event, what Cortâzar calls a "knockout." Cortâzar further theorizes this fall in terms of the technique of "cutting." The aperture produced by the short story not only knocks out the reader but also is a "secuestro momentàneo," an instantaneous kidnapping ("Cuento" 378). Suddenly the reader is arrested by the story, set apart and cut off from any previous context. This sepa- ration happens against the reader's will - as a function of reading regardless of intention. In fact, one could say that this act of sequestration is the short story's way of citing the reader: to be sequestered by the story is also to be quoted, to be cited by the aperture that the story opens up. To read a short story is therefore to be open to the event of the reader's own ruination: what "befalls" the reader is the event {acaecimiento) of falling into the trap of the short story. Unlike traditional storytelling, the short story does not connect the reader to the experience of the collective unconscious. Rather, the short story violently cuts off the possibility of connection and freezes the reader in a suspended state. In this way, the cuento takes the fall of experience as its enabling condition. However, the aperture produced by the cuento is not simply violent (although this violence cannot be denied). It is important to note that the aperture is also quite clearly an opening and a beginning: the apertura or inauguration of something new. He writes: "the purpose [of the writer] entails, among other things, the real- ization of the environment proper to the tale, which obliges one to keep reading, which traps one's attention and isolates the reader from everything that surrounds him, so that later, upon finishing the tale, the reader may find himself connected 15 It is useful at this point to refer to the way trauma theory has similarly emphasized the event of a fall. For example, in his analysis of Benjamin's reading of Baudelaire, Kevin Newmark concludes: "The resultant fall, or trauma, that lies hidden in reading the [Baudelaireian] text is therefore one that now must befall the reader, whose sole task is to register and understand what actually does take place in all these texts" (253). Similarly, Cathy Caruth focuses on the event of falling when speaking about the structure of delay in traumatic experience. By reading Paul de Man's theory in relation to Kant, Caruth shows "how the problem of reference became, in the history of thought, inextricably bound up with the fact of literal falling" (75). She goes on to explain: "In de Man's text, as in Kant's, the impact of reference is felt in falling . . . This significance has the weight of a paradox: that reference emerges not in its accessibility to perception, but in the resistance of lan- guage to perceptual analogies; that the impact of reference is felt, not in the search for an external referent, but in the necessity, and failure, of theory . . . What theory does, de Man tells us repeat- edly, is fall; and in falling, it refers" (89-90).</page><page sequence="13">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 256 to his circumstance in a new way ..." ("Cuento" 378). The aperture is therefore both the violent end of the reader's previous life and the beginning of something new. The act of reading a short story traces an arc that follows a negative moment of violence and separation, only to return on the other side of the arc to an "enriched, deeper, and more beautiful" circumstance (378). The event of falling - the acaecimiento - is a negative effect that the subject traverses momentarily until being able to rise up again, this time within a higher state or a new circumstance. Cortâzar's theory of the cuento or short story, then, is itself a story about the Hegelian subject who rises out of a negative moment in order to reach a new begin- ning, a sublimated state. The apertura of the short story is the mark of this dialec- tic, and the word itself shifts in meaning as it moves along the dialectic.16 In its first moment, the apertura produces a violent shock effect that loosens the subject from a particular context. On its return arc, the apertura becomes the inauguration of something new. The true story of any short story is this double movement: first, a moment of disconnection and pétrification, which takes place while reading or writing the short story; second, a moment of reconnection and a link to a new life as the subject moves away from the short story. In effect, the possibility of entering history is predicated on this ability to enter into the story presented by the form of the cuento. Indeed, regardless of the actual content of this or that short story, the form itself ends up transmitting the possibility of a political relation, of a relation to a new polis. As Cortâzar puts it at the end of his essay, a great short story is one that would function as a pure transmission: "it will have to transmit to the reader as all fundamental things are transmitted: from blood to blood, from hand to hand, from one person to another [de hombre a nombre]" ("Cuento" 385). This future short story (it should be reiterated that this essay was first delivered to an audience in Cuba in 1963) would present the conditions for a true polis: a political community founded on the pure transmission of the form of the cuento. However, it should be emphasized that the short story does not overtly tell a political story; rather, the form of the cuento is important only for its transforma- 16 In order to explain the movement of sublimation (sublation or Aufhebung), Hegel uses what he calls the speculative or philosophical proposition. For instance, in the sentence "God is being," there is normally (that is, grammatically) a distinction between subject (God) and predicate (being). However, in the speculative sentence, the subject loses its objective basis and is continuously thrust into the predicate, while the predicate finds itself already in the subject. As Hegel puts it, thinking suffers a negative counter-thrust in the speculative sentence: "Starting from the Subject as though this were a permanent ground, it finds that, since the Predicate is really the Substance, the Subject has passed over into the Predicate, and, by this very fact, has been sublated" (37) . What seemed previ- ously like a mere accident (a mere predicate of the subject) is in the speculative sentence revealed to be a crucial moment in the progress of thinking. As Werner Hamacher explains, using Hegel's example "God is being" to indicate the movement of the speculative sentence: "The subject can no longer appear as the bearer of accidents, but instead combines and closes with its predicates, inso- far as every accident now presents a case of essential predication and therefore reveals itself as cosub- stantial with essence . . . The subject, 'God,' 'falls,' into the universal and is lost, but in its fall into being, which is its essence, it is 'sublated' and finds itself unified with its whole speculative move- ment of all and sublation: it becomes the concept" (6). For a discussion of Aufhebung (sublation or sublimation) as the exemplary speculative word, see Lyotard: "If thought's delight culminates in aufheben, it is because this term from ordinary language is also the name par excellence oî the specu- lative operation. The Selbst, or subject of the ordinary phrase or phrase of the understanding, is circu- lated by speculative discourse among the various instances presented by that phrase. In this becom- ing, it is at once preserved and removed" (93). I suggest that Cortâzar's use of the word apertura follows a similar movement.</page><page sequence="14">CORTÄZAR'S READING OF BENJAMIN 8c POE / 257 tive ability, that is, its ability to change the life of the reader and to put the reader into relation with others. In fact, what is at stake for Cortâzar is always the relation- ship between "life" and "the written expression of life," a relationship that he sees as a "fraternal battle" ("Cuento" 370). In effect, Cortâzar asks: How does one write a story that takes the reader's very life as the object of its transformations? This task is the "battle" that takes place within the form of the cuento, and "the result [el resultado] ... is the short story itself, a living synthesis as well as a synthesized life, something like the trembling of water inside a crystal, a fleetingness within per- manence" ("Cuento" 370). In this way, the short story turns out to be the place where "writing" and "life" are connected in a living synthesis. At the same time, the form of the cuento would also seem to be the very condition of politics: by taking up the life of the reader, it allows a subject to become - in a virtual way - an agent or actor in a story that links the subject with others.17 The cuento thus tells the story of the subject's disconnection from and subsequent reconnection with the polis in a new context that might institute new political relations. Unfortunately, this story is true only as a story, as a fiction that defines the form of this genre. Unlike the "real story" theorized by Benjamin and Hannah Arendt, in which there is no true author or author-function, Cortâzar's cuento empha- sizes the writer who creates a fictional story to forge a synthetic life. In Arendt's view, this artificiality would disqualify the cuento as a form of true (political) story- telling: "The distinction between a real and a fictional story is precisely that the latter was 'made up' and the former was not made at all. The real story in which we are engaged as long as we live has no visible or invisible maker because it is not made. The only 'somebody' it reveals is its hero . . . Who somebody is or was we can know only by knowing the story of which he is himself the hero - his biography, in other words" (Arendt 186). Although Cortâzar explicitly hopes that the cuento might be the space in which one might resolve the conflict between life as it is lived and the narrated version of life ("life" and "the written expres- sion of life"), this resolution takes place only in fiction. In reality, the subject remains trapped within the form of the cuento.18 Once the story has begun, it is 17 Cf. Arendt: "That every individual life between birth and death can eventually be told as a story with beginning and end is the prepolitical and prehistorical condition of history, the great story without beginning and end" (184). It is worth remembering that Arendt's minimal definition of politics is "action" between human agents: "Action, the only activity that goes on directly between men without the intermediary of things or matter, corresponds to the human condition of plural- ity, to the fact that men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world. While all aspects of the human condition are somehow related to politics, this plurality is specifically JA* condition - not only the conditio sine qua non, but the conditioper quam - of all political life" (7). Arendt goes on to note that action "creates the condition for remembrance, that is, for history" (Arendt 9). However, action without speech is no longer action (178-79). For that reason, political action only takes place as the unfolding of the actor's story. In Renarración y descentramiento, Hermann Herlinghaus notes this relation between Arendt and Benjamin in his discussion of the storytelling practices of Subcommander Marcos (see especially chapters 6 and 7). 18 Cohen arrives at a similar conclusion in his reading of "Las babas del diablo": "The transformation of the lived into the photographed - 'the seeing' into 'the seen' - cannot for Michel dispel the disqui- eting aspects of the scene [caught by the camera] Far from producing a tranquil fixation of that morning onto photographic paper, the camera has turned out to be the machine that recapitulates, Michel realizes as he stares beyond his typewriter, all the undecidability of the scene" (21). Although Cohen does not refer to Cortâzar's essays on the cuento, his argument interestingly suggests that this comparison between photography and writing a short story is already at play in this early short story.</page><page sequence="15">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 258 impossible to rejoin life within a new context. Although the story might end with the reader's reconnection to the world, the reader cannot in fact leave the form of the cuento behind in order to find a new connection to life. Like the water trem- bling inside the frozen crystal, the reader remains petrified within the form of the short story. Of course, this is not to say that the reader does not find a new life in this frozen crystal. As Cortâzar insists, within the form of the short story the reader finds a living synthesis of "life" and "the written expression of life": a synthesized life. However, this new life is not Arendt 's version of the "biographical"; rather, this new life is fabricated or synthesized in the crystalline structure of the cuento. The short story turns out to be the image of a necessarily artificial life that allows the reader to survive. To be able to live at all, the reader must remain trapped within the form of the short story. In a way, Cortâzar is simply taking Benjamin's conclusions to their limit: if storytelling was responsible for connecting the reader to unconscious experience or Erfahrung, the short story must take up this task in a new way. How- ever, to ask that the cuento reduplicate what the "real story" once performed is to ask the impossible, since experience {Erfahrung) is already going through a pro- cess of irreversible decay. The best the storyteller can do in the modern age is produce a kind of artificial storytelling. This fake "real story" therefore cannot be the condition of politics in the way that it is defined by Arendt (the possibility of becoming the agent of one's own story). But at the same time, the short story is not simply a form that produces without consequence a unique effect. In Cor- tâzar's hands, this seemingly innocent form is nothing other than a kind of artifi- cial respiration machine: the reader plugs into this storytelling machine in order to live, in order to have a life, albeit a synthetic one. Rather than connect the reader to a continuous unconscious experience, the short story produces a petrified image of experience, an artificial Erfahrung In this way, Cortâzar suggests that the death of storytelling has been subli- mated into the form of the short story. Storytelling now takes place as a machine that always produces the same narrative in two stages. In a first moment, the machine reproduces the shock that marks the "fall" from storytelling and that transmits the pure event in itself; this shock severs the subject from a life that was no longer connected to Erfahrung in the first place. In the second moment, the machine produces a kind of synthetic Erfahrung that enables the subject to survive after the decay of experience. The subject then necessarily remains trapped within the story, petrified in its crystalline structure. Cortâzar suggests that the cuento quite literally marks the afterlife of storytelling as well as the afterlife of every- thing else that depends on this lost practice; it introduces the afterlife of memory, experience, politics, and history. The cuento, then, does not refer to this or that short story, but rather to a generalized mode of telling an artificial story that pro- duces, as an effect, an artificial polis. However, precisely to the extent that the cuento is an artificial structure, this new polis cannot be performed as the full presence of the "people" or as the expression of a full political experience. In this sense, his theory is Utopian: it is an attempt to rethink utopia as the non-place of story- telling, that is, as a non-community that takes place, as an event, through the nar- ration of a cuento. For Cortâzar, a new political community can only be forged</page><page sequence="16">CORTÄZAR'S READING OF BENJAMIN &amp; POE / 259 through the paradoxical act of telling the story of the absence of community, a community that is always about to arrive. Therefore, the afterlife of storytelling is also the beginning of a politics to come. California State University, Fullerton Works Cited Anidjar, Gil.
