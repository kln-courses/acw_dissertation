As such, the Socrates Of snails, musician of pears, principium And lex. Sed quaeritur: is this same wig Of things, this nincompated pedagogue, Preceptor to the sea? ?Wallace Stevens, "The Comedian as the Letter C" MANY years ago I heard a joke which I have repeated from time to time, though never quite sure why. It goes like this: A man was passing the Waldorf-Astoria one day when he heard loud bursts of laughter coming from inside the Grand Ballroom. Being curious, he slipped inside and discovered a banquet in progress. Suddenly one of die banqueteers called out "278!" The number was greeted by a roar of laughter. As it subsided, someone else shouted "531!" And again an outburst of glee rocked the ballroom. This pattern of numbers and laughter con tinued for some time, while the man looked on in amaze ment. The proceedings were finally interrupted by one banqueteer who in response to "349!" had gone into such convulsions that he was still laughing and wiping his eyes long after the others had stopped. No longer able to contain his curiosity, the onlooker took advantage of the pause to ask a nearby waiter what it all meant, "Well, sir," replied the waiter, "this is a convention of comedians, and they're telling jokes. But they all know the stories so well, they don't have to tell the entire story; ? 1978. The Sewanee Review. 0037-3052/78/0115-0084$01.44/0.</page><page sequence="2">JOSEPH MOSES 85 all they have to do is give the number of the joke and everyone laughs." The curious onlooker musea on this explanation for a moment, and then pointed to the still convulsed comedian at the nearby table. "But why is he still laughing so hard?" "Oh," answered the waiter, "I guess he never heard that one before." Like minimal art and minimal painting, there is a signifi cant category of what we might call minimal humor. I open with an instance of it, not from perversity, but because it has an emblematic relation to humor in general and to the par ticular kind of humor which is our subject?the pure and abstract comedy of form. As to the first objection, that my joke is not funny?at least not in the usual sense?we shall dispose of it at this point by stating dogmatically that laughter and comedy are not synonymous; they do not mean the same thing; they are not even reciprocal conditions for each other. This dissociation of comedy from laughter is not new; we find it supported by many critical statements, from Ben Jonson's "nor is the moving of laughter always the end of comedy" to Wylie Sypher s more recent contention that "comedy may, in fact, not bring laughter at all." George Meredith declared himself similarly in the Essay on Comedy. Yet while the joke lacks "funniness," we still recognize in it the form of humor, and it is therefore worth examining further. An important part of the joke-structure derives from its punch line which reverses and confounds a logic pains takingly established earlier. It is the disparity and contra diction of that "switch" that establishes the form of humor. The last line wipes out the earlier premise and leaves the hearer in proprietorship of a logical instability, as a conse quence of which he laughs, or smiles, or at least recognizes the outline of what we call a "joke." Another way of putting it is to say that humor juxtaposes two contradictory situations?conflicting milieus?each of</page><page sequence="3">86 THE COMIC COMPULSION which has, separately, its own legitimacy. What makes us react humorously is perceiving a gap in the veneer of con sistency, recognizing that the assumptions of coherence that provide the basis for our living and our security are no more than an illusion. Here, for example, the initial reasoning posited a logic which makes knowledge of a joke a sufficient cause for laughter. The punch line reverses this tenuous as sumption by invoking another "logic"?i.e., the funniest stories are those that we have never heard before, the logic of "stop me if you've heard this one." The conflicting logics collide in the rational impossibility of laughing at a joke so fresh and new that the laugher does not even know it now. In the first place, then, the story demonstrates a character istic feature of all humor?reversal, contradiction, paradox, in congruity. Enough has been written about this comic per ception of discrepancy, the perspective by incongruity, so that we may merely reiterate that it is the condition of humor?whether in the disfiguration of the human counte nance in a clown's mask, the dislocation involved in the comic pratfall, or the dfelexia inherent in the simplest one-liner: " 'I love you!' he ejaculated." Secondly, and equally important, we can emphasize that since humor is a function of perception, its operative force is intellectual and conceptual. The reason we laugh at Pinch wife in The Country Wife or at Chaplin in Modern Times is that we see the inadequacy of their mistaken and insufficient behavior. The insufficiency in the first case is that of paranoid suspicion; in the second instance it is the insufficiency of de humanization which conditions a factory worker to apply his wrench to any nutlike protuberance, even the buttons on a policeman's uniform. We laugh?and in both cases our laughter is a cognitive "measuring" of the break in a pre sumed continuum. But apart from that recognition of contradiction which the story of the comedians' convention shares with the Chaplin esoue humor of Modern Times, and with all humor, there is</page><page sequence="4">JOSEPH MOSES 87 a significant difference too which we remarked: our story is not as "funny." The difference is extremely relevant to our discussion of comedy since it is a difference in the degree of abstraction or artificiality. We might say that the story of the comedians' convention is a "purer" case of humor, for it is a totally arbitrary and "unnecessary" construct. It exists for its own sake and creates its first premise in order to parade the contradiction of its second premise. It is totally "intellectual" humor and relates to the human condition only as a para digmatic reflection about the nature and structure of comedy itself. It is a joke, in other words, which has little human content, but is sheer play. Laughter, as Freud and others since Freud have pointed out, is a release, a deliverance from the anxiety and tension inherent in a threatening contradiction. One of the reasons that Harpo Marx can reduce us to hysterics is t?iat the situa tions in which he is funniest are extremely tense and anxiety ridden. Total collapse threatens from all sides. The police are about to storm in; the creditors are about to triumph. The zaniness of Harpo is a release from the normal-rational logic which obtains into another 'logic." And we laugh because we recognize that inconsistency and discontinuity provide a gap into which his logic can wedge. What Harpo does is actually to celebrate the discrepancy of human existence and human affairs which are thus vulnerable to the redemption of his comic harp. The dynamic is generally true for Chaplin also, even though in his case defeat rather than triumph is the result* But defeat is modulated into a comic acceptance by our ability to laugh and consequent?y to behold the alternative to tragic self-annihilation. Chaplin's comedy is probably the most potent refutation of Bergson's theory that laughter is always a distancing and is based on a dissociation from the object of laughter. What Bergson did not see and what Chap lin so vividly dramatizes is that humor and laughter can also be close, personal redemptions from the disastrous claustro^</page><page sequence="5">88 THE COMIC COMPULSION phobia of single vision. Bergson's notion that the comic must always be objective is in itself too stringent an interpretation of the intellectual nature of humor and a purblind denial of the human mind's tolerance for ambiguity. But if laughter usually emerges from the human situation and if comedy is frequently saturated with desire and reality, there is an abstract comedy, too, that reflects not on the human material but on the process of contradiction. Without making any absolute claims, I may nevertheless point out that my story belongs in this second, more rarefied category of jokes which explore the comic process. It illus trates the singular and uniquely human phenomenon of in tellect and perception becoming the subjects of a further intellectual and perceptual examination. Surprise, reversal, and discrepancy are not only part of the mechanism of the story; they are its subjects too. If it elicits little laughter in the telling, laughter nevertheless exists already within the story. It is a joke about laughter, so to speak, signalled by laughter and originating in laughter even before any humor becomes apparent to us. The social and "conventional" hi larity emanating from the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria functions both as a condition of the story and as its content. Like many "jokes" this one too uses an instance of the ridicu lous in its initial situation; but that situation is clearly arti ficial and arbitrary?a convention of comedians trading joke numbers?and is not torn from the ridiculous actuality of existence. At best it mirrors the experiential absurdity, but for itself it exists in a purer and in a less human absurdity. Its abstractness is an emptying of content, a presentation of the form of humor?which is to say, of the processes of mind and cognition. In discussing the comic in The Dyers Hand W. H. Auden makes an interesting and useful observation. He relates the "horror joke" of the mother who tells her blind daughter to count to twenty and when the daughter opens her eyes she will be able to see. When the daughter follows these instruc</page><page sequence="6">JOSEPH MOSES 89 tions only to find that she is still blind, the mother says, "April Fool!" Audens comment is: "This has the same rela tion to the comic as blasphemy has to belief in God, that is to say, it implies a knowledge of what is truly comic." Auden's observation is just. The horror joke is, in its way, an examina tion of the comic, testing the versatility of comic structure as applied to any content. To be sure, it also shares a feature of gallows humor, attempting to supplant a doomed emotional perspective with a more liberating abstract one, as in Dick Gregory's famous Christmas card of the early sixties: "Merry Christmas?from the back of the bus!" Auden draws attention to an aspect of humor largely ne glected or not seen clearly at all. There is a category of humor that is self-conscious, reflexive, and ironic, a game of comedy which is self-scrutinizing and which attempts to laugh at its own rules and definitions: we might call it a comedy of humor. Possibly the largest group of stories demonstrating such ironic inversion is the one referred to as the shaggy-dog story ?a form of the comic in which the telling itself constitutes the humorous displacement and in which that crucial re lationship between story and punch line is subjected to reversal and undercutting. The tag line of a shaggy-dog story, for instance, is frequendy the dullest, the most pointless, or the least rational in the whole story. We cannot indulge ourselves here with recounting such a story, for in its emphasis or narrative disproportion the shaggy-dog story is traditionally interminable. The subjects vary considerably but are always purged of human-emotional content?sometimes by a hazy magnitude (die explorer who sets out to discover the mystery of life), sometimes by a trivial absurdity (a herring-loving traveling salesman who is pursued from coast to coast by a ubiquitous talking herring), sometimes by an axiomatic senselessness (a man in an apart ment on the west side of Manhattan decides to buy an Arabian stallion).</page><page sequence="7">90 THE COMIC COMPULSION Yet in each case the shaggy-dog story is an exercise in form which attempts to determine the comic possibilities?per ceived discrepancy?that may yet emerge from unpromising materials. In other words is it possible to recognize by laugh ter a purely abstract inconsistency when the initial premises are themselves absurd and abstract? The classic laboratory specimen of such humor may be the routine?also not very funny?which goes like this: First chef: What was that ladle I saw you with last night? Second chef: That was no ladle; that was my knife. The exchange has, of course, no meaning at all if one does not recognize in it the parody of an earlier burlesque routine. But assuming even that one recognizes the second version as a travesty of the first, a burlesque of its burlesque, one must also recognize how much more "abstract" the humor has gotten. We are no longer involved in a human situation, in the battle of the sexes, in the paradox of marriage, in the contradiction between familiarity and contempt. The second version has become emptied of such human paradoxes as the discrepancy between desire and fulfillment, and it substi tutes instead the mere form of the earlier "joke" using arbi trary verbal echoes and symbols to retain that form and maintain the validity of form. The humor is no longer a laughing humor; it is at best a chuckle. And what it delights in now is the self-reduction to a skeletal form which we have described. We are left with a comic examination of form on the one hand and of language on the other, which is essen tially a matter of form also. We might say that the exchange between the two chefs is someone in the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria calling out "Number 218." Or we might with greater audacity say that the teller of this story bears some relation to Wallace Ste vens's comedian, a teller of symbols, a gamesman in the ab</page><page sequence="8">JOSEPH MOSES 91 stract and the procedural, an artificer of such uncommon subtlety that the very term comedian becomes for him too human and too gross. For he may be alluded to only by his single abstract initial: the merest echo of his art. By examining humor?both the laughing and nonlaughing variety?we have begun to see some indications of the comic as an abstract play of form perceived intellectually, a game whose rules are contradiction and antithesis. Our next ques tion is: what is the relationship between this comic activity and that usually designated as "comedy" in literature?i.e. The Clouds, A Midsummer Night's Dream, or Man and Superman? Just as Keats says that "in the very temple of Delight/ Veiled Melancholy has her sovereign shrine," so most writers who have sought to explain comedy have collided at some point with the phenomenon of tragedy and tragic awareness. That surprising encounter is unavoidable from almost any approach. The most affecting comic characters in literature, for instance, are artistically realized by a simultaneous dis play of their tragic dimension. "Unto this day," proclaims the Wife of Bath, "it dooth myn herte boote/That I have had my world as in my tyme." But time has made her old. "The flour is goon, ther is namoore to telle: /The bren, as I best kan, now moste I selle;/But yet to be right myrie wol I fonde." The ground of our satisfaction in that comic portraiture is its refusal to ignore the tragedy of time while liberating us from the compulsion of a tragic view. Again Bergson is only half right in noting that the conditions of comic laughter are ex ternal and objective; for the greatest and truest comic sense is one which recognizes the subjective tragic threat. Maurice Morgann similarly, in his essay on Falstaff, undertakes to re claim our understanding of Falstaff from the thin single minded view of his comicality: "It cannot escape the reader's notice that he is a character made up by Shakespeare wholly of incongruities; ?a man at once young and old, enterprizing and fat, a dupe and a wit, harmless and wicked, weak in</page><page sequence="9">92 THE COMIC COMPULSION principle and resolute by constitution, cowardly in appear ance and brave in reality." The same admixture of comic and tragic features is emphasized by Meredith in the Essay on Comedy when he singles out Cervantes's treatment of Don Quixote as "in the loftiest moods of humour, fusing the tragic sentiment with the comic narrative." He goes on to affirm that "the stroke of the great humorist is world-wide, with lights of tragedy in his laughter." If tragic awareness exists in symbiosis with the comic and if it can help us understand comedy, we must be prepared to meet it on its most basic level?as the expression of our doom. We die. And throughout our fives we are bound to the injustice, the irrationality, and the loneliness of that fact. Again we encounter paradox. There is no living without a self, an ego, an I. That self, that individual ego (necessarily divorced and sundered from all other conscious entities), and that individuality most intimately prized?these will die. All this is magnificently unfair. It is inhuman. It is inconceiv able. And it is so. Furthermore our tragic premonition gener ates a tragic corollary relating to the circumstances of life: it too is arbitrary, ultimately inexplicable, and lacking the mini mal consistency which our desperation might willingly substi tute for higher justice. "Life," we are fond of saying, "is tragic. The terms that we have invoked in opposition to tragedy reason, justice, consistency?are countertragic in two ways. First the terms imply evaluation by human consciousness, thus conferring primacy on that consciousness. Second they imply continuity, since coherence means connection and since connection describes the only permanence we can know. Conversely tragedy refutes the primacy of human conscious ness, and in doing that it denies coherence and continuity. Endemic to the tragic paradox is the Janus-nature of our separateness: so essential to our selfhood and survival, yet condemning us, through its requirement, to discontinuity and fragmentation. When Pascal says that every man dies alone,</page><page sequence="10">JOSEPH MOSES 93 he is speaking about a single terminal moment; he may also be speaking as well of every moment that leads to it and that prefigures it. It is in isolation that we feel our terror and our grief; it is as an inarticulate solitude deprived even of ex pression, since expression belies futility. Even the experience of dramatic tragedy, which is neither mute nor private, is hardly an exercise of our understanding and intelligence, since tragedy has no fundamental appeal to their mediation. The experience of tragedy is predominantiy subjective and emotional, exacting from the spectator the leap of identifica tion from his own loneliness to the awful loneliness of the tragic hero. Almost but not quite. For we have so far alluded to a bleak universe which is unbearable. Given the truth of this view, with its futility, with its torment and loneliness, how do we survive? How indeed can we function within such a consciousness? The perception of tragedy itself constitutes a repudiation. We are aware of our tragic fate, but that very consciousness provides the perspective and the distance in which redemp tion from tragedy can occur. Pure tragedy would be locked and dumb in the inarticulate self. Its suffering, the agony of its despair, is disordered and mute beyond the organization of language. The "perfect" suicide cannot speak of suicide, and the rest is silence. But consciousness, even of tragedy, is the paradoxical opposite of tragedy; and like language which is its medium, it moves always toward the comic. To know, to be aware, entails relating experience to some "idea of order"; and ideas of order have a continuity and permanence apart from the chaotic experience of our mute flesh. This suggests the redefinition of tragic drama as the ex treme test of comic consciousness, or?to use Auden's words tragic drama implies "a knowledge of what is truly comic." We can begin to see it as a hazardous inquiry into the extent to which order can be salvaged from the chaos of arbitrary and irrational history. Early in Oedipus Rex, when Oedipus</page><page sequence="11">94 THE COMIC COMPULSION accuses Creon of conspiring against him and distorting the pronouncement of the oracle, we recognize this as an under standable attempt to contain the conflict within the knowable construct of society. We can sympathize and identify our selves with Oedipus's attempt, for here in the blueprinted pattern of human society he might find an easier, comic vic tory. And when the members of the chorus enjoin him to stop accusing Creon, Oedipus rightly laments that they do not know what they are asking. The request demands that he surrender the stability of a reasoned order and move beyond it into the disorder of larger history. Yet precisely that sur render is what tragedy forces. For it is on the larger existential stage that tragic drama seeks to discover a human location, to domesticate the void, to make the simple triumphant mark that will reduce pandemonium to a tamed quantity. The great tragedies are thus comic redemptions, establishing hu man consciousness at the farthest outposts of experience and enlarging the territory of the comic. Let us stress tibe movement of tragedy toward a statement of order and identify that movement as comic. Comedy is consciousness, both in its need for order and in its attempt to satisfy that need, to maintain pattern, to redefine the bal ances. Tragic drama takes consciousness and places it pre cariously outside the limits of social reassurance, confronting it with a vastness that is terrifying and uncharted. But the di rection of dramatic tragedy, like that of dramatic comedy, is toward order and reason. What Hume called the "unaccountable pleasure" we derive from watching tragedy begins to seem, on the contrary, quite accountable. The poets and the artists [Schiller wrote] are poor adepts in their art when they seek to reach the pathetic only by the sensuous force of affection and by represent ing suffering in the most vivid manner. They forget that suffering in itself can never be the last end of imitation,</page><page sequence="12">JOSEPH MOSES 95 nor the immediate source of the pleasure we experience in tragedy. The pathetic only has aesthetic value in so far as it is sublime. Now, effects that only allow us to infer a purely sensuous cause, and that are founded only on the affection experienced by the faculty of sense, are never sublime, whatever energy they may display, for everything sublime proceeds exclusively from the reason. Once we begin to recognize comedy as "reason," or con sciousness in search of a design, we begin to understand truly not only the intellectual character of humor but the social character of comedy. We begin to perceive what Meredith called the comic spirit not only as the recognition of discrep ancy and contradiction but as a necessary and completing self-criticism. It is an unrelenting essential commentary on both process and product, on the abstract intellectual system, and on the realized social system. For even within the circle of a systemized human construct the search for design and consistency brings us face to face with the asymmetrical and the inconsistent. The coherence which consciousness always demands leads us into die shock and discomfort of incoher ence. Consistency exposes us to contradiction and harmony to dissonance. In humor and comedy we find the instruments of accommodation, the possibility of turning discrepancy into a "comic" formula. Humor is a way of connecting?if by no more than juxtaposing the antinomies?disparate and con flicting actualities: youth and age, the saint and the sinner, the traveling salesman and the farmer's daughter. How can one reconcile into a single context true piety and false piety, true wit and foppishness, true love and puppy love? We do it by a humorous sharpening of the distinction into paradox, recognizing that in the alchemy of paradox contradiction can become metaphor. If we need the resolutions of tragedy in order to reduce the universe to human consciousness, we also need the resolu tions of comedy because in the reduced universe we can, and</page><page sequence="13">96 THE COMIC COMPULSION unavoidably do, see the insufficiency of human consciousness. For example, in the always impending chaos of our exis tence, one of the things that might define and locate us is the erotic impulse. But the identity derived from Eros is neither stable nor reliable. Were we to seek a rationale for our lives as "lovers" in Eros, we would find ourselves constantly be trayed by its inadequacies and treacherous paradoxes. Pas sion is short-lived, shifting, and fickle. It exists in aspiration and is vitiated in satisfaction. The self-denial of its ardor like the cancellation of its climax closely associates it with death. Various works of literature dramatize the possible betrayals of erotic identity. Orlando, Tristan, Anthony symbolize the tragic insufficiency of passion. Passion and boundless desire, therefore, are never the sub jects of comedy since these are the lonely exploration of the nearly inarticulate self. It is only in its bounded and limited counterpart, when love is reduced to a known quantity and pattern, that love becomes appropriate for comic treatment. It is accurate, rather than cynical, to say that comedy does not treat of love; what it treats of is courtship and marriage love reflected in the social mirror. After we have reduced Eros to the proportions of conventional human behavior we begin to examine the flaws and discrepancies of the con ventions. In its unbounded state, desire can be held to no rule and no law, and in the condition of its freedom are found the terms of its doom. But upon enclosing desire within a safe social ambience we have presumably applied the dic tates of consciousness and reason; we have supplied that ele ment whose absence frustrates human effort into tragedy: reason. That circle humanly closed, that arranged social order makes possible and then demands the genius of comedy. In A Midsummer Night's Dream "the sharp Athenian Law" that drives Hermia and Lysander into the wood functions also to define the limits of passion within the play and insure its comic movement. Clearly an absurdity exists in the law itself, an absurd extension of human reason and logic: "As</page><page sequence="14">JOSEPH MOSES 97 she is mine," says Hermia's father Egeus, "I may dispose of her;/Which shall be either to this gentleman,/Or to her death." The Athenian law which exacted a daughter's obedi ence in her father's choice of husband under penalty of death sounds ominous perhaps, but it is in actuality or the play a complex comic device. It encloses the action within hu manly manageable questions. It illustrates the grotesque re sults of logic and consistency, in enabling a father to dispose of his daughter either to his choice of husband or to the executioner. Finally it creates the need for violating the law, riot as a leap into the unknown but as a means of sustaining through some modification?the sociocomic equilibrium. The Theseus-Hippolyta presence in the play also drama tizes the comic duality I have been talking about?a social control that becomes the condition for discrepancy. Theseus is the personification of Athenian law. Perhaps a more hu mane version in stressing to Hermia her option of entering a convent, he is nonetheless determined to see the law carried out. Ironically, though, Theseus is himself about to wed, and the contradiction between his severe treatment of Hermia and his own self-indulgence is stressed. Hermia must decide by "the next new moon" which Theseus identifies as "the sealing day betwixt my love and me." Or again, after re peating that Hermia's failure to obey her father will lead her either "to death or to a vow of single life," Theseus turns direct?y to his bride: "Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?" The framing of action in a socially controlled and super intended universe continues throughout the play. Reason con tinues to dominate, to domesticate, and to reveal the "faults" of that provisional ordering. When the four young lovers flee the world of Athenian law they do not enter unbounded free dom where d?sire becomes a yearning toward self-cancella tion. They remain very much the products of Athenian social order and carry along with them into the wood its bourgeois virtues. In the forest they reenact the minuet of social court 7</page><page sequence="15">98 THE COMIC COMPULSION ship. Lysander may urge, "One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;/One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth"; but Hermia stubbornly refuses, and her refusal keeps the play centered on courtship and marriage, not love. "But, gentle friend," she responds, "for love and courtesy/ Lie farther off; in human modesty/Such separation, as may well be said,/Be comes a virtuous bachelor and a maid." No, this is hardly the language of passion. Hermia is too ready to temper "love" with "courtesy," too concerned with what "may well be said." Of even greater significance, however, is the continued external control. For in escaping the authority of Theseus's Athens, the lovers subject themselves to the power of Ober on's wood, a control more potent and more beneficent, yet that of a society which is governed and has its rules. The magic of Oberon's power, therefore, exaggerates like a fun house mirror the dual comic aspects of control and contradic tion. Oberon commands the entire wood, but his supremacy falls short of prepotency over Titania. That break in Oberon's authority is crucial, for it constitutes a reprise to the various failures of social authority and inconsistency that mark the play. Nevertheless Oberon's restatement of control is the clearest, the most abstract, the most nearly perfect. The Oberon-Titania restatement of contradiction, therefore, is the least threatening and most comic. Similarly Puck's error in compelling Lysander to become infatuated with Helena is a simplified and purified replaying of Demetrius's incon sistent infatuation with Hermia, a "joke" carried even further between Titania and Bottom. Human frailty and faithlessness are purged of their tragic burden by the magical creation of an abstract nocturnal universe. The pull of that analogy works. We must surely exonerate Lysander from any wrong doing in his compelled infatuation for Helena, and if Lysan der is exonerated then Demetrius must be also. In the world of unlimited Eros, the faithlessness of a lover and the inconstancy of love move us toward tragic recogni tion, toward shattering. This happens for Troilus as it does</page><page sequence="16">JOSEPH MOSES 99 for the maddened Orlando. In the less existential and more "artificial" comic world, faithlessness becomes an instance of contradiction, of the inadequate social formulation. As we decrease its self-identifying emotional content and increase its intellectual and abstract content, strange things happen: in Theseus's Athens it has comic potential; in Oberon's wood it becomes farcical in relation to the lovers and fantastic in relation to Titania and Bottom. Again, as we move from the tragic world to the comic world to the farcical world, we are stepping into progressively reduced and limited arenas. The more intellectual and artificial the conditions, the more easily we can laugh?like Puck?at mortal folly and inadequacy. Consciousness is always comic in its insistence on appre hensible pattern. It must see a face in the moon, an elephant in the clouds, the safety of sequence in the chaos of number. It is incorrigibly anthropomorphic, incessantly productive, creating from a minor human axiom the languages of systems and the language of words. Comedy and humor though are more than conscious: they are self-conscious, ironic. Reflexive and therefore critical, comedy and humor see the blemishes in the face of the moon, the third tusk of the elephant, the digit unaccounted for in the sequence. Comedy is a critique of the comic, domesticating consciousness, reason turning back on itself. It is amused at the limits of its language and the gatherings of its systems, and with high irony it identifies them by pun and by joke. We have seen that the Athens of A Midsummer Night's Dream is Shakespeare's re-creation of a social system with its subpatterns of class, of princely and paternal authority, of courtship and mating, etc. The complications and contra dictions inherent in this "ordering" are illuminated by ironic examination. Authority should be consistent but, as we noted, it is not in the case of Theseus. Paternal affection, too, is vulnerable and can be attacked by the "logic" of ownership. The most potentially neat arrangement?two pairs of lovers can be easily frustrated through errant affection. Just as the</page><page sequence="17">100 THE COMIC COMPULSION action of A Midsummer Night's Dream is a process of healing this lacerated system, of making sufficient die social pattern, so the ironic-reflexive impulse also carries a healing function. The corrective of irony is a means of enlarging and modifying the formulation of a more naive consciousness. For comedy, too, is a process of "naming"; it perceives contradictions, and the perception extends the possibility of inclusion by means of the ironic bridge. In trying to set down a morphology for humor and comedy, I have stressed (perhaps overstressed) its practical and thera peutic aspects. There is more. Or at least its action can be stated in easier terms. Above all else comedy celebrates the variousness of an imperfect universe in which we mercifully are not crushed in the clutch of a tyrannous logic. "Twice two is four," says Dostoevsky's Underground Man, "is an impertinence." Worse than that, we might add; it is a tomb. We need "all things counter, original, spare, strange"; and we too would praise the "fickle" and "freckled." Once we feel sure that our lease to existence is not threatened* that we have earned our tenancy, so to speak, comedy allows us to have it both ways?to be forever surprised, to discover the unpredic table marvelous, and yet to be sustained and supported on the surface of the accommodating intellect.</page></plain_text>
