<plain_text><page sequence="1">RICHARD ETTINGHAUSEN : From Byzan- tium to Sasanian Iran and the Islamic world : three modes of artistic influence. (The L. A. Mayer Memorial Studies in Islamic Art and Archaeology, Vol. III.) viii, 69 pp., 27 plates. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1972. Guilders 40. This slender volume from one of our most eminent authorities on the art of Islam and its antecedents investigates with copious scholarly documentation several of the interesting con- texts where Classical or Byzantine motifs ap- pear in the iconography of Sasanian Iran, or later of the Umayyads. The first subject treated is the occurrence on Sasanian silver of Dionysiac themes deriving from those naturally common on Classical tableware. The icono- graphic importance of the panther (as indicat- ing Dionysiac inspiration in later renderings where other aspects of the scene are not obviously typical) is well emphasized, and the later Sasanian and Islamic vessels with panther handles are traced to this source. At the same time we should not overlook the possible rele- vance here of the earthen vessels of Achae- menid and Hellenistic date with zoomorphic handles which current field-work is exposing in growing numbers in Iran, though few have yet been published. Analogies of the British Museum bowl (0. M. Dalton, The treasure of the Oxus third ed., London, 1964, p. 49) illustrating 'the Triumph of Dionysus' are carefully explored. They include the almost incredibly naIve Moscow piece, presumably Sasanian, and must all, as one would suppose, derive from a lost Hellenistic archetype with various fanciful adaptations and misunder- standings in different exotic contexts. Such diffusion of a well-known Classical subject is often attested (one may cite the Zeus with Aegina on the Tcherdin dish, found again at</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 699 Nagyszentmiklos). For the important stylistic group to which the British Museum bowl belongs, and of which further specimens have recently been reported, the author tends to accept Dalton's date c. A.D. 200, and attribu- tion to Parthia; but a Bactrian or Kushan origin, maintained in some quarters, is also plausible. The statement (p. 9) 'the figure of the youthful male god Dionysus apparently had no equivalent in Iranian myths ' is not to be accepted unquestioningly, since the important deity Haoma, personification of the mystic herb of Zoroastrianism, would have been an appro- priate identification in the period of Hellenistic syncretism. There are in fact hints of a close system of identifications between Hellenic and Iranian deities during that period-Heracles with Bahrim, Hermes with Narseh, and even the anthropomorphic Hestia of the Nisa rhyton, since the cult object of that goddess was a ritual fire, with the male Zoroastrian Adur. The Dionysiac bowls could thus have been credited with a religious meaning even in Iranian terms, though essentially the products of a different culture. The second subject treated is the occurrence of Pegasus on a number of recently reported Sasanian bowls, in one case representing the capture of the steed at a spring by the hero Bellerophon. The extensive occurrences of the Pegasus motif in Sasanian art are investigated, but the discussion here throws valuable light on a context not specifically treated, since on the seal-impressions from Takht-i Sulaymin the winged horse has a close association with the sacred fire known as Adurgushnasp 'the Stallion's Fire '. It has to be admitted that the great pool at Takht-i SulaymAn would have supplied a very passable Hippocrene, so that once more a close parallelism is encountered between Greek and Iranian mythology. That systematic equations of the two systems were worked out and propagated under the Seleucids is hard to demonstrate, and Alexander, at any rate, never visited Takht-i Sulaymin; yet the repeated allusions between one culture and the other can hardly be accidental. The third and largest section of the book is concerned with the function of the so-called ' Bath Hall' at Khirbat al-Mafjar, a residence of the Umayyad prince al-Walid b. Yazid. The case made that this actually served as a throne-room and banqueting-hall is certainly strong. That an object hanging by a stone chain from the roof represented the ceremonial qalansuwa hat, suspended after the fashion of the Sasanian crown, is most ingenious. That the small Diwin with its mosaic of the deer and the lion possessed' royal connotations' (p. 44) is evidently plausible, and indeed one might be justified in pushing the argument further. Research on iconography of an earlier period suggests that the motif of the lion and the stag conveys as its essential meaning the moment of death (represented also in other forms) and symbolizes the action of one or other of the ancient gods of death, more particularly known as Nergal, or in Phoenicia as ' Molek ', the latter name remembered in Qur'An, Siira XLIr, 77. The two sides of the mosaic would there- fore represent the alternatives of life and death, and the room could be interpreted as a chamber of siydsa judgement in which the ruler, sitting in camera, exercised such power. The author suitably quotes Matthew xxv, 31-46 for the significance of the left-hand side as that of the condemned man (for the lion is on the left, and on the right are the peacefully grazing deer); and the same thought of course occurs in Qur'An, Sfira xc, 19-20: hum as4dbu 'l- mash'amati, 'alayhim narun mu'sadatun. The book is thus fertile in insights into the meaning of post-Classical iconography in the East, and will play its part in clarifying this material. A. D. H. BIVAR</page></plain_text>
