SHAILER MATHEWS Dean EmerituSy Divinity School, University of Chicago thanks to the schoolmen, Aristotle became a minister of orthodox theism he introduced a new god to Christians. The God of the Bible was treated by the philosophers as in earlier times he had been treated by herds- men and warriors. He became different. He would be a most in- genious explorer who could find Jehovah of Hosts "in the Trin- ity of the divine persons discerned by purified minds." In fact the term "God," historically viewed, has never maintained the same content. It has always been relative to the conditions under which those who used it lived. The Olympians and the Indian gods, Isis and Jehovah were not creatures of metaphysics but of religion. They had reality as they assisted in adjusting human life to the activities of the universe. As individual persons they never existed. The god of orthodox Christianity has had great influence as a sovereign but when metaphysicians have under- taken to prove his existence they have abandoned sovereignty and have turned to abstract or highly generalized terms. That is the element of truth which lies in the statement that man created God in his own image. If the term God is only the pattern used by the worshipper the epigram triumphs. For the maker of epi- grams God, like Great Pan, is dead. But obviously many persons do not believe he is dead. Even when journalists regretfully announce his demise, millions of persons worship him in thousands of buildings consecrated to him. Scientists write books about him. Children learn the Ten Commandments which he gave to Moses. Governors issue proc- lamations asking citizens to beseech him to modify drought or rain storms as the crops demand. Prayer for his blessing opens public dinners and presidents call on nations to thank him for whatever light may be breaking through the darkness of de- 389</page><page sequence="3">The American Scholar pression. Pacifists pray to him for peace and dictators question his Nordic qualifications. But if not dead is he emeritus? Is religion akin to the loyalty of old graduates to men who once were their teachers but who now have honor without classrooms? Are churches transcenden- talized alumni associations? If one were to listen to those who claim to represent the mod- ern spirit the answer to such questions would be a sophisticated affirmative. God may reign in the underworld of history but has no place in the modern world of honesty, science, and moribund capitalism. Inherited religious inhibitions may prefer laments over a departed theism to a proclamation of atheism, but the emancipated see no future for the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He is the creation and symbol of ancestral piety and mid- Victorian romanticism. Of course the members of our intelligentsia mean to be polite to the God that they believe has retired from the world of today. They may not pray but are not averse to church weddings and rather prefer to have a religious color given to funerals. But in their minds God has really no duties to perform. He has retired into the Heaven of poetry and naive religion. It is not hard to understand how such relegation of God to innocuous desuetude took place. The god whom men have wor- shipped has not been the god of the philosopher. One does not pray to the Absolute or find help from an Infinite Being possess- ing attributes which are human qualities raised to the nùï power. The god of childhood can hardly be the god of the scientifically minded. The god of orthodoxy seems ill at ease in a universe of law. No one claims that this is the best possible world and Moody's Masque of Judgment wherein the dragon which has consumed the universe at last swallows God himself is more in keeping with modern unbelief than the satire of Candide. If God be nothing more than the inherited ideas of God, theism has indeed been outmoded. Yet if we are to judge from philosophical and scientific lit- erature, and indeed from much current fiction, there is in the 390</page><page sequence="4">Is God Emeritus? background of even the most sophisticated a belief that the world would be much better off if God could be induced once more to assume direction of affairs. "If there were not a God," Voltaire once said, "we should have to invent one." That is a pragmatic argument which all those possessed of privilege are likely to make. Religion keeps the masses in order. The gods have always been friendly to the social and intellectual status quo. Socrates was executed as an atheist because he believed that the deity was more than the gods and goddesses of the Athenian state. Critics of our contemporary morals lament the disintegrat- ing effect of the loss of fear of God's punishment for violation of the social code. There is little danger of revolution so long as religious authority is unquestioned. Even business men declare that religion is necessary if Allied debts are to be adjusted and prosperity is to return, if banks are to lend money again and the dangers of inflation are to be avoided. It may seem unfair to blame a retired God for the difficulties into which the NRA has fallen but the general feeling that things will not be better until God acts is as much an expression of a belief that he has retired from the management of the world as it is a sort of socialized faith-healing. If one is to understand these apparent inconsistencies in the attitudes of our supposedly intelligent class it is necessary to ap- proach God from the point of view of human experience rather than of metaphysics. Generally speaking the idea of God held by any one generation is an inheritance from its ancestors rather than the outgrowth of adventurous thinking. In consequence a religion becomes something to be defended when the world views of two generations come into conflict. The god who could be trusted to meet difficulties of the past seems incompetent to meet those raised by the new knowledge of the universe given by science, and of social changes due to industrial revolution. In moments of distress and danger men accustomed to accepting their fate from an absolute monarch find it easier to submit to an inscrutable providence than do men who accept the law of uni- formity in nature. Modern democrats believe they have rights 391</page><page sequence="5">The American Scholar which the deity must respect. For the pre-scientific mind a mir- acle is an evidence of the existence of God. For those accustomed to the domestication of nature by engineers, a genuine miracle is unthinkable. Exceptional facts, such persons believe, can be brought within the general scheme of things. They cannot be- lieve that diseases or accidents are due to specific decisions on the part of an omnipotent personality. They fear bacteria rather than devils. Most religious doubt arises from the fact that men try to live in two intellectual strata. The attempt to solve problems, posed by the knowledge of natural forces and social trends, by the use of theistic conceptions embodying outgrown scientific assumptions and social experience is bound to beget disillusion. God comes under investigation. Divine decrees are not of the same order as natural laws. The creators of Christian dogma had not even an elementary knowledge of modern science. No dreams of constitutional monarchy, democracy, or human equality had affected their social order. Their sovereign god might not be able to abolish evil but he at least permitted it and would rectify all injustice after death. Belief in such a god was a source of courage and consolation to its possessors. It fitted into their world view. The will of God sent men on crusades, led them to accept earthquakes and storms and pestilence as punishment, saved them from misfortune, and rewarded them for martyrdom and death in battle. His relations with mankind were expressed in political doctrines. His decrees were the basis of human destiny and his acts though inscrutable were patterned after the justice and mercy of absolute monarchs. His Commandments were the basis of morality. In a word, re- ligion was of the same pattern as the pre-scientific, pre-demo- cratic social order. When this social order changed, religious patterns derived from it were increasingly inoperative and subject to an increas- ingly acute criticism. God had to be redescribed. Intellectual liberty in the Renaissance was limited by the fact that culture was largely under the control of ecclesiastics and consequently 39*</page><page sequence="6">Is God Emeritus? found expression in the field of art rather than in science. The 1 8th century, however, saw the rise of anti-ecclesiastical thought which either denied that the god of the church existed or rele- gated him to the position of a first cause who had created and set in motion a universe from which he withdrew. In the 1 9th century, when scientific research and the spread of democracy became dominant, religion had to concern itself with something more radical than ecclesiastical heresies. The political patterns in which its faith in God was expressed seemed incompatible with current methods of confronting problems which had for- merly led to prayer and pious submission. The champions of scientific research were often loyal to the Christian church but God did not enter their laboratories nor was he discovered by their microscopes and telescopes. For less ecclesiastically loyal persons the ultimate became the Unknown} agnosticism checked affirmations regarding his relations with the world. In a word, a god became unnecessary. Such in effect is the plea of humanism - that philosophical cave of Adullam in which many sorts of rebels find companion- ship. With the positive terms of humanism any historically minded person would be in sympathy; so also with its insistence that progress will depend on intelligent social engineering rather than on divine interposition. One can sympathize with its im- patience with those who would substitute piety for duty and make faith in God an alibi for their own inaction. But is that the last word on the matter? We have a universe on our hands. However ungrateful we may be we have to admit that in it we live and move and have our being. Our life depends upon proper adjustment with those environing activities that have made evo- lutionary process emergent rather than merely reproductive. Whatever philosophical and scientific hypothesis we may adopt, personality-producing activities must still be within our cosmic environment. A religion is a technique for adjustment with such personality-producing activities. A social process furthering personal values is as much an evidence of the existence of cosmic activity as is heat an evidence of those other activities with 393</page><page sequence="7">The American Scholar which the chemist and physicist have to do. One set of activities may be temporarily better understood than another but they are equally unescapable. There is a division of labor in the understanding of cosmic intelligibility. The departmentalized science of a half century ago has become a regimented attack upon cosmic activity from a variety of angles. When Thomas Aquinas says that God can- not be known in his essence but can be known in his effects he is saying only what scientists and philosophers say when they use such terms as time and matter and energy as convenient uni- fying symbols of innumerable reports of human experience born of controlled experiments. The evolutionary process makes it imperative to recognize personality-producing activities as well as those with which the scientist is engaged. Nor is it irrational that in their religions men have under- taken to utilize their social experience as techniques for adjust- ment with cosmic activities. Anthropomorphism is not confined to religion. The language of physics, when it is not strictly mathematical, is as analogical as that of theology. Human ex- perience is really the basis of all description. There would be no knowledge of our friends and neighbors without anthropomor- phism. As we find ourselves personal, so we believe that per- sonality is expressed in those purely physical experiences by which we know each other. A human body that comes within the area of sight, sound, and touch is no less material than a wax image but we can attribute to it values we find within our own experience and set up personal adjustment with it. The universe is no more material than are our bodies, but whether anthropo- morphism can be extended to it is to be answered by experiment and understanding. Certainly such extension as an attempt to come into dynamic relationship with a conditioning environ- ment is justified by the intelligibility and traceable tendencies which a growing knowledge of the universe discloses. Such knowledge may forbid our use of the naive anthropomorphism of the ancient religions but it does not forbid adjustment with the universe on the level of personality. The history of human- 394</page><page sequence="8">Is God Emeritus? ity is no more the history of impersonal relationship with the universe than it is that of successive attempts to make personal adjustments. When once we see that "God" is our conception of those personality-producing activities of the universe with which we are organically connected the pattern is no longer that of politics but of biology. An organism seeks the development of life through a relationship with the environment which has condi- tioned its development. Such a conception is not metaphysical but instrumental. From such a point of view we do not seek to prove the existence of God but the legitimacy and efficiency of a theistic conception in establishing a help-gaining relationship with the cosmic environment. We do not know the exact nature of those activities with which we seek adjustment any more than the physicist knows exactly what is meant by the word mat- ter or the biologist what is meant by the word life, but their effects and methods can be known by observation as truly as we can observe the effects and methods of the physical activities. If the older conceptions of God were efficient in the cultures from which they sprang, so we may expect that a concept of God that springs from our better understanding of the laws of nature and of society may be effective today. However pictured, the relationship of humanity with those cosmic activities is a datum which must be taken into account in any attempt to un- derstand human life and its possibilities. The natural objection to such a view is that this is not the sort of God men want. They want one that holds his children's hands and in other respects is a transcendentalized father. They want him to cure sickness, ward off danger, and arrange the weather to suit their need. But when did men ever worship the god of philosophy? Only when the Absolute has been personalized through a sort of poetry has it been the object of prayer. Plural- ism, with its finite god, may be a romantic interlude in theo- logical thought but sooner or later one has to choose between a realistic view of the universe and a metaphysic prodigal of capi- tal letters. As a matter of unemotionalized fact our ideas of God 395</page><page sequence="9">The American Scholar are shaped in patterns which rationalize an urge, inherent in life itself, to personal adjustment with the universe. Human beings can no more abandon their trust in that which is believed to be cosmic response than they can abandon breathing. The pat- terns with which they picture and justify such recognition will vary from touching wood to belief that the universe is instinct with activities with which one can be personally adjusted. But whether intelligent or unintelligent, whether superstitious or philosophical, men seek help from that upon which they feel themselves dependent and over which they have no control. When they do this by impersonal techniques they are scientific. When they do it by utilizing personal experience they are re- ligious. God, as the conception of personality-producing activi- ties of the universe, becomes an instrument of this adjustment. In such action there is established a dynamic situation in which patterns are indispensable but never metaphysically abso- lute. If the flower in the crannied wall is to help one under- stand what man's relations with God are it must be left in the crannied wall. All religions are expressions of this sense of or- ganic unity with that upon which humanity as personal seems to be dependent. The mystic has no monopoly of such relation- ship. The church that limits grace to those who have met cer- tain ritual and theological conditions has a technique of adjust- ment just as truly. The man who sees in brotherhood a personal adjustment with the coordinating (or nucleating, or integrat- ing, as one prefers) activity of the universe has it also. All alike recognize their personal relations with activities which they did not originate but from which they sprang and with which they must be in harmony. Such a relationship makes religion the basis of a morality that seeks to further personal values. The neglect of such values brings social catastrophe. Gods have be- come emeriti when they cease to be efficient instruments of such adjustment, but those personality-producing activities of the universe which we picture as God and with which directly and indirectly we must be in personal relation are never outgrown. They will be operative as long as the universe exists. З96</page></plain_text>
