<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nature and Background of Major Concepts of Divine Power in Homer. By Odysseus Tsagarakis. Amsterdam: B. R. Gruner Publishing Co., 1977. In the U.S.A. distributed by Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, N.J. Pp. xviii + 160. Paper. $25.25. There seems to be no letup in the plethora of books being published about Homer on both sides of the Atlantic. Professor Tsagarakis of Memorial University of Newfoundland has added to this flood of recent publications with his handsomely printed but exorbitantly expensive book on Homeric religion that draws heavily on the Homeric texts, contemporary classical scholarship, and modern archaeological, linguistic, and anthropological studies. He also draws relevantly from modern Greek folklore and popular religion. His book is intended primarily for students of Homer who know the original Homeric Greek text (no English translations are provided) and key Homeric terms are generally transliterated. The book reads like a ponderous dissertation and is occasionally characterized by unidiomatic English. The organization of the work centers on discussion of the ancient divine trinity of Zeus, Apollo, and Athena; the meaning of theoi, theos , daimon, and moira in the Homeric poems; and concludes with a multilingual bibliography, a Greek index, a general index, and an index of passages. Tsagarakis believes that the major religious concepts in Homer are poetic but that they are also related to the concepts of the Greek worshipper. Zeus stands out as supreme among the Greek gods, as is evidenced by the actions and reaction of the human actors; more than physical, Zeus' power is related to his will. Zeus protects the rights of strangers and suppliants ( Zeus xeinios) and sanctions oaths (Zeus horkios). Zeus oversees the social order and provides stability. He is concerned with and oversees human affairs. Though Zeus is assisted by other divinities, Apollo and Athena intervene in human affairs independently of Zeus to support their chosen people and at the same time to cause trouble to others. Their power, however, is limited. Tsagarakis finds the concept of good-giving, evil-averting gods rooted in popular belief. The term theoi is seen as not only poetic but also popular, involving anthropomorphic personal gods, as against theos , which can be viewed as a general deity. The theoi are as rational and moral as their worshippers, and there are perhaps here more poetic intentions than genuine religious experience" (p. 139). According to Tsagarakis, daimon can be related to favorable and unfavorable divine interventions: "For Homeric man daimon seems to be no more than another term of reference to his gods with some of which he may still be identified" (p. 140), while moira is highlighted in situations that occur against one's will - a power that is inescapable and inevitable - not a personal deity but a power whose functions are at best identified with or ascribed to Zeus. Tsagarakis 's aim was to examine closely the nature and historical value of the religious concepts attributed to Homeric man. In Nature and Background of Major Concepts of Divine Power in Homer he has done this in a detailed way that can be quite useful to the serious and patient student of the Homeric poems. - John E.
