Barrett, Ph.D.(Georgia) Professor of Zoology , Miami University , Oxford, Ohio 45056, USA; sometime Ecology Program Director, National Science Foundation . Introduction A paradigm is a body of ideas that is sufficiently coherent to attract widespread acceptance (e.g. a par- ticular scientific discipline). Paradigms are needed in science to provide, quite clearly, the conceptual and contextual status upon which a particular branch of knowledge depends. They thus define areas of science at specific times, and also characterize educational phi- losophies and research approaches such as are inherent in new fields of knowledge. Both ecology - the study of living organisms in rela- tion to their environment - and environmental science were recognized as important environmental paradigms throughout the 1970s. Ecology is here defined as that scientific discipline which attempts to elucidate the structure, function, and behaviour, of ecological sys- tems, whereas environmental science is characterized as an interdisciplinary science that attempts, inter alia , to measure and evaluate the impact of Man on the struc- ture and function of social and ecological systems, and the effectiveness of management of these systems for Man's benefit and survival (Barrett &amp; Puchy, 1977; John- son, 1977; Barrett, 1981). Surprisingly, these two paradigms, both of which relate to an improved understanding of the natural world, are in reality at opposite ends of a philosophical (research and educational) spectrum. An attempt will now be made to illustrate this spectrum in the North American context and then to suggest an approach whereby much of the current polarization between these important paradigms can be integrated for the education and training of a new 'breed' of ecological scientists that seems likely to be needed increasingly in the future. Distinction Between Ecology and Environmental Science Ecology and environmental science must be distin- guished and separated in order to discuss properly the environmental spectrum which ranges from the basic (scientific or 'liberal arts') to the applied (professional) educational and research philosophies. Table I summa- rizes several important differences between ecology and environmental science. These differences need to be recognized and understood in order that positive steps can be taken to integrate the educational philosophies and research approaches inherent in each paradigm. Ecologists have long recognized the ecosystem* as a basic unit of study in ecology (Evans, 1956). Johnson * Regarding definition of this key term, see page 198 of this volume. - Ed. (1977) summarized current ecological concepts as they relate to an ecosystem paradigm. Ecosystems have tradi- tionally been viewed as natural systems (i.e. the impact of Man on ecosystem structure and function has been largely ignored). Although Man is considered in terms of 'Man in Nature' by most ecologists, ecosystem stu- dies usually focus on a 'Man outside Nature' approach. Man-related compounds (e.g. pesticides, heavy-metals, and radioactive materials), however, are now found in most 'natural' ecosystems. Further, the influence of Man's socio-economic system on ecosystem dynamics can no longer be ignored (Barrett, 1978, 1981). Table I A Summary of Differences between Ecology as Here Defined and Environmental Science (modified after Barrett, 1981). Environmental Attribute Ecology Science Leading Unit of Study Ecosystem Noösystem Anthropomorphic Connotation Man 'Outside Nature' Man 'In Nature' Educational Philosophy Scientific ('Liberal Professional Arts' in USA) Academic Philosophy Widely Disciplinary Interdisciplinary Research Philosophy Basic Applied Research 'Algorithm' Scientific Method Problem-solving For these and other reasons, Barrett (1981) proposed that the ecosystem continue to be recognized as a basic unit of study in ecology, whereas the noösystem be defined as the basic unit of study for environmental science. The noösystem concept would include not only the study of the structure and function of Nature, but would also embrace the social, economic, and cultural, influences on ecological systems (i.e. the noösystem concept would attempt to include biological, physical, and social science, influences and interrelationships). In line with the 'classical' definition given at the beginning of the second paragraph of this paper, North American ecology still carries with it a strong connota- tion for the biological sciences (Baldwin et al ., 1975). Moreover it is based on a 'liberal arts' educational philo- sophy (Barrett, 1981), is disciplinary in its teaching and research philosophy (Odum, 1977), and emphasizes 319 Environmental Conservation, Vol. 11. No. 4, Winter 1984 - © 1984 The Foundation for Environmental Conservation - Printed in Switzerland.</page><page sequence="2">320 Environmental Conservation the scientific method of research prosecution (Piatt, 1964; McCormick &amp; Barrett, 1979). Environmental science, on the other hand, relates to environmental principles and processes regardless of discipline (Watt, 1973), is based on a professional educational philosophy (Barrett, 1981), is interdisciplinary in its teaching and research philosophy (Johnson, 1977), and utilizes a problem-solving research methodology (McCormick &amp; Barrett, 1979). Whereas the scientific method is the accepted approach to basic ecological research, environ- mental science projects are more typically designed in an applied problem-solving framework (Redfield &amp; Barrett, 1983). There thus exists an environmental spectrum ranging from the scientific or 'liberal arts' (ecology) with a basic research approach to the natural world (i.e. the study of ecosystems), all the way to the professional (environ- mental science), with an applied research approach to the natural and Man-made environment (i.e. the study of noösystems). I suspect that the pressure to establish a National Technological Foundation (NTF) in the United States (Walsh, 1980), as an applied counterpart to the National Science Foundation (NSF), has its roots in this academic and research spectrum. The importance of professional certification for ecol- ogists (Barrett et al ., 1982) also relates to this polariza- tion problem. It is important that this gradient be recog- nized, and that personnel be trained to function along the spectrum as a whole. We no longer have the time or financial resources to remain polarized at one end only of the spectrum. I therefore suggest that applied ecology be recognized as that branch of science which integrates the teaching, research, and management, approaches of both ecology and environmental science into a new inte- grative paradigm. Applied Ecology As applied ecology is an important component of environmental science (McCormick &amp; Barrett, 1979), and as, for example, it represents the largest single sec- tion within the Ecological Society of America (K.L. Brown &amp; McCormick, 1981), I suggest that applied ecol- ogy be recognized as that integrative science which encompasses the principles, concepts, and methodol- ogies, of both ecology and environmental science in an attempt to educate personnel across the total environ- mental spectrum (Fig. 1). It is imperative that applied research be integrated with basic research as educational philosophies, man- power trends, and research needs, continue to change (Barrett et al ., 1982), and because any segregation of basic and applied science would be likely to impede advances in new areas of integrative ecological research (e.g. landscape ecology). There is a real need to incor- porate more ecological theory and principles into applied research. Likewise, there is a need to inculcate applied-research methods, such as problem-solving, net energy, and cybernetics, into basic ecological research. Further, there is a compelling need to use both basic and applied research approaches as we incorporate ecolog- ical principles and case-histories into fisheries, silvi- culture, and agriculture, in order to promote long-term, cost-effective solutions to management problems (Redfield &amp; Barrett, 1983). Research procedures in the future should be based on the scale of research to be conducted and the questions and/or hypotheses to be addressed (Fig. 1). New units of study, such as of total landscapes, should provide a new type of research synthesis; a richness of empirical stu- dies, emergent theory, and useful applications, could thence emerge (Forman, 1983). This type of integration and synthesis should also promote a transdisciplinary (Jantsch, 1972) awakening in higher education.

Applied ecology programmes should become estab- lished in colleges and universities which provide a new, holistic curriculum. Such programmes should become very cost-effective as institutions of higher learning face increased financial burdens in the 1980s (e.g. inflation, declining enrollments, and needs of capital improve- ments). Fields of study which emerged largely during the 1970s include ecosystem analysis (Hammond, 1972), resource science (Holling &amp; Chambers, 1973), stress ecology (Barrett et al ., 1976), and landscape ecology (Forman, 1983). These fields, and others, could become vital areas of teaching and research within the applied- ecology paradigm. For the next decade, countries such as the United States are expected to have great needs for scientists and engineers (Abelson, 1981). These needs will probably become particularly acute as they relate to personnel trained to view and help solve environmental problems in terms of a holistic approach. Personnel trained</page><page sequence="3">Barrett : Applied Ecology: An Integrative Paradigm for the 1980s 321 in such areas as technological impact-assessment, resource management, systems analysis, and land-use planning, should be in high demand in the future (Barrett et al ., 1982). Applied ecology programmes could serve also as a vital industrial-academic-governmental interface in the years ahead. Internship, and practical action and cooperative programmes, should continue to flourish as applied ecology 'centres of excellence' develop. Graduate students would receive 'real-world' expe- rience, and senior scientists would become 're-tooled' as new research technologies and methods of procedure evolve. Such 'cells' could focus on long-term ecological research programmes (e.g. concerning acid rain or landscape management). Integrative applied ecology programmes should accordingly provide the environ- mental personnel needed during the 1980s and beyond. Educational Philosophy Both undergraduate and graduate students need to become trained in a tripartite manner (Fig. 2). First, they need to become educated concerning those proce- dures which help one to explore the environment in a truly interdisciplinary manner (e.g. scientific method, problem-solving, ecosystem analysis, net energy, and cybernetics). It is important that students learn how to attack a problem systematically, and to recognize that RESEARCH ALGORITHMS (E.G., SCIENTIFIC METHOD, A PROBLEM-SOLVING, AND CYBERNETICS) //applied'' / (ecology) ' RESEARCH RESEARCH TOOLS EXPERIENCE (E.G., COMPUTER SCIENCE, (E.G., INTERNSHIPS, STATISTICS, AND COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH, SPATIAL ANALYSIS) AND INDUSTRIAL CO-OP PROGRAMS) Fig. 2. Tripartite training philosophy for applied ecology. For ' algorithms 'procedures ' may be substituted. different procedures and methods may be employed as different circumstances and factors dictate. Individuals who are educated in research methodologies of both ecology and environmental science may accordingly find themselves in the greatest demand in the future (McCormick &amp; Barrett, 1979). Second, each student needs to be competent in the use of a variety of research 'tools' (e.g. computer sci- ence, statistics, spatial analysis, thermodynamics, and modelling). Different levels of biological organization, ranging from molecules to large landscapes, will neces- sitate a diversity of research tools being employed, depending on the scale of the investigation. Indeed, this scaling concept needs to become an inherent part of applied ecology from an educational viewpoint. Shull (1978) pointed out that each student should possess a set of tools that enables him or her to define, attack, and solve, new problems. Third, applied ecology students need to recognize that there exists a diversity of research training opportu- nities (e.g. internships, practical action and collabora- tive research programmes, cooperative training pro- grammes with industry, and research opportunities at long-term ecological research centres). Students should be encouraged to select their research experience on the basis of such factors as research scale, training philos- ophy, available research equipment, team interaction, and research approach. Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) Centres sponsored by the National Science Foundation in the United States (TIE, 1979), Man and the Biosphere (MAB) programmes (Bâtisse, 1980), and Biosphere Reserves (Bâtisse, 1982) throughout the world, represent ideal centres for new types of holistic, integrative research and training. These centres also demonstrate the global perspective that will surely be needed for future environmental research and effective education (Polunin, 1982). At present, both ecology and environmental science need a fresh new synthesis in regard to addressing important ecological questions (e.g. biotic diversity and ecosystem regulation). J.H. Brown (1981), for example, pointed out the need to merge the ecosystem ecology school of research, led by Eugene Odum in the United States, with the evolutionary ecology school of investi- gation, led by the late Robert MacArthur. Odum (1977) articulated the need to combine reductionism and ho- lism if science and society are to be engaged together for their mutual benefit. Catton (1983) noted that social scientists are too habituated to perceiving human prob- lems without having the benefit of ecological perspec- tives. He, too, argues the need for a new paradigm to address important ecological questions. Redfield &amp; Barrett (1983) stressed the need to encompass hypo- thesis-testing (e.g. cause-and-effect mechanisms) with problem-solving (e.g. impact assessment) approaches in order to promote cost-effective resource management. Applied ecology is, therefore, an ideal paradigm to merge basic ecological principles, concepts, and theory, with the long-term and large-scale environmental prob- lem-solving needs currently confronting society. It also provides an excellent problem-solving opportunity to unite reductionist and holistic research perspectives. Summary There currently exists an environmental spectrum ranging from ecology (i.e. a basic, theoretical research approach) to environmental science (i.e. an applied, problem-solving testing approach). It is suggested that applied ecology be recognized as an integrative para- digm which encompasses the principles, concepts, and procedures, of both ecology and environmental science in an attempt (a) to unite reductionist and holistic</page><page sequence="4">322 Environmental Conservation research approaches and educational philosophies, (b) to generate a new synthesis for addressing important ecological topics such as biotic diversity and ecosystem regulation, (c) to educate personnel across the total environmental spectrum, and (d) to develop transdisci- plinary 'centres of excellence' which serve as vital industrial-academic-governmental focal-points for long- term, integrative research endeavours. At present there is a dire need to develop unifying theory and coherent principles regarding the patterns, processes, and interactions, of both the natural and man-made environment. There also exists an urgent need to help solve problems related to world food pro- duction, energy resource management, genetic diver- sity, and environmental contamination, among many others. Further, the progress of emerging fields of study, such as landscape ecology and systems communica- tions, will be likely to be impeded if such fields are not recognized as the synthetic interactions of numerous related disciplines. These fields of study hold great research potential for systematically addressing the above-mentioned problem-areas, but require the flexi- bility to merge new research approaches, technologies, and scientific theories, in an efficient, cost-effective manner. It is suggested that applied ecology serve as an integrative paradigm for these new and vital interdisci- plinary fields of knowledge. The 1970s witnessed the evolution of a plethora of new communication technologies and a rich diversity of environmental research programmes and facilities. There also arose the recognition that most major envi- ronmental problems are interdisciplinary in nature, long-term in duration, and may require a new dimen- sion (insight) for their successful resolution. What has thus far failed to emerge in the 1980s is an integrative paradigm, as well as an academic administrative um- brella, which serves to integrate these new technolo- gies, theories, academic philosophies, and research needs, in a cohesive framework that will train the personnel needed in the 1990s and beyond. It is now abundantly clear that the need for enlight- ened management of resources (both biotic and abiotic) will intensify during the years ahead, as population pres- sures continue to build up and increasingly strangle our world. It is also clear that a 'new breed' of scientist is needed to address simultaneously the interactions of natural ecological and noöspheric processes in order to understand better the total landscape mosaic of Planet Earth. This understanding, based on both ecological and socio-economic integration, should result in improved long-term decision-making with the leadership of applied ecology. References Abelson, P.H.
