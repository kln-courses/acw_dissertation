VOLUME 16 JULY, 1957 NUMBER 4 Measurement as Scientific Method in Economics By LELAND B. YEAGER* I Methodological Sermons TIME AND AGAIN the cry goes up that economics has lagged behind the natural sciences and that it must adopt their methods, precise measurement in particular. This idea is epitomized in the former slogan of the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics-"Science is Measurement." It is reflected in Joseph Schumpeter's high admiration for statistical work, almost without regard to the results achieved.1 It gets extreme emphasis in Reconstruction of Economics, a booklet by E. C. Harwood2 distributed early in 1955 to members of the American Economic Association. Colonel Harwood uses terms like "Platonic idealism," "medieval scholasticism," "dialectical quest for certainty," "revelation," "intuition," "word magic," and "hypostatization and dialectical facility" in expressing his dismay at the backward and unscientific state of contemporary economics. Econo- mists should wake up to the "Galilean revolution" and adopt "modern scientific method": quantitative measurement of change and study of the relations among changes. Harwood scorns any "outmoded distinction" between the natural and social sciences purporting to justify differences in method. * The author thanks Mr. John C. Dawson for his painstaking and helpful arguments against the views expressed here. 1 History of Economic Analysis (New York, Oxford University Press, C1954), pp. 211, 511, 519-26, 961-2, 1123-4, and passim. A few further examples should bring many more to the reader's mind: Jan Tinbergen, in Econometrics (trans. by H. Rijken van Olst, Philadelphia, Blakiston, 1951), pp. 4-5, likens merely qualitative economics to the medieval stage of natural science. J. B. Condliffe, in The Commerce of Nations (New York, Norton, 1950), p. 673, prominently quotes a former natural scientist on "What the Social Scientist Can Learn from the Natural Scientist." Wassily W. Leontief, in "Input-Output Economics," (Scientific American, October 1951), p. 15, makes an invidious contrast between deductive economics and quantitative physics. 2 Including papers by May Brodbeck and Richard S. Rudner (Great Barrington, American Institute for Economic Research, 1955).</page><page sequence="2">338 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology II Measurement in the Natural Sciences YET NO NUMBER of epithets or references to Galileo can conjure away a real and important distinction. In the natural sciences, measurement is indeed important enough to suggest the slogan "Science is Measurement." Let us see why. First, observation and experiment have forced belief in certain numerical laws and constants of nature. Some examples are the numerical relation among volume, pressure, and temperature of a gas, and constants such as Avogadro's number (the number of molecules in 22,400 liters of any gas at specified pressure and temperature), the mechanical equivalent of heat (foot-pounds per B. T. U.), the constant of universal gravitation, the velocity of light in a vacuum, Planck's elementary quantum of action, atomic weights and numbers, and the relative masses and charges of various subatomic "particles." Such constants were not merely in- vented; they forced themselves upon scientists through repeated agreement among results of all relevant measurements.3 Thus the natural sciences do have things to measure--things other than transitory numerical facts of specific historical situations. A related point is that measurement in the natural sciences leads to inferences about conditions, including qualitative conditions, that are not directly observable. Measurement helps find "yes" or "no" answers. It yields clues needed to decide among rival hypotheses about qualitative aspects of nature.4 This point can be made clear by reminding the reader of some well known examples: Galileo was not content with the merely qualitative observation that bodies fall with increasing speed. He wanted to test the more definite hypothesis that speed goes on increasing in simple proportionality to time (which implies that the distance covered is proportional to the square of the elapsed time). Lacking instruments to measure the rapid motion of bodies in actual free fall, Galileo ingeniously "diluted" gravity by working with balls rolling down an inclined plane. His measurements were corn 3 Max Planck, Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers, trans. by Frank Gaynor, New York, Philosophical Library, 1949, pp. 172-3. 4Cf. Morris R.

Galileo thus discredited the Aristotelean concept of forces as that which produces velocity and arrived instead at the concept of force as that which produces acceleration. He inferred that a body in motion would continue moving in a straight line at a steady speed forever unless some force were opposing this motion. Newton had the idea that the force holding astronomical bodies in their orbits was the same as the force of gravity at the earth's surface. This idea, expressed precisely in the inverse-square law of gravitation, found support in numerical observations (after a correct measurement of the earth's radius had become available). The law would predict the observational results already summarized in Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Other observational facts, such as the movement of the tides in their correlation with the position of the moon, could also be derived from it. Eventually Newton's law received further confirmation from measurements with a torsion balance of the gravitational attraction emanating from lead balls. Count Rumford was intrigued by the hot shavings produced in boring brass cannon. The prevalent theory attributed the heat to the squeezing out of "caloric" from the brass. Rumford reasoned that if that were so, less "caloric" should remain in the shavings than in the same weight of solid brass. He measured whether a given weight of hot shavings had less ability to heat water than the same weight of solid brass at the same temperature. He found no difference. Rumford further noticed that a blunt borer would produce great heat with little removal of metal. The amount of heat developed seemed to depend more on the amount of mechanical work done than on the amount of metal removed. Rumford set about making a crude measurement of the proportionality between mechanical work and heat. Later, Joule's more precise experiments on the dissipation of mechanical energy by friction showed that the amount of heat produced always bore the same quantitative relation to the mechani- cal energy dissipated. As a result, heat came to be recognized as a form of energy and not a substance. Only precise weighing could have established the laws of definite proportions and of multiple proportions: every chemical compound always contains the same elements in the same proportions by weight; and if two elements combine in more than one proportion, the quantities of one element combining with a fixed quantity of the other are in simple numeri- cal proportion. These facts induced chemists to adopt Dalton's atomic theory of matter. Measurement of atomic weights was prerequisite to establishment of Mendeleyev's highly suggestive periodic system. An improved system 339</page><page sequence="4">340 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology became possible when Henry Moseley measured the X-ray radiation fre- quencies of various elements and classified the elements in the order of their frequencies. The successive frequencies appeared to be arranged not haphazardly but in a step-like progression. Certain gaps in the series of "atomic numbers" (as Moseley called the positions in his table of fre- quencies) suggested missing elements. A formula devised by Moseley predicted the frequencies that the X-ray lines of the missing elements should have and so led to spectroscopic detection of these elements. The concept of a periodic table and the systematic recurrence in it of elements with similar chemical characteristics provided important clues in the study of atomic structure. In repeated breeding experiments, Mendel observed that about one- fourth of the offspring of hybrid pea plants showed the recessive trait (for example, green- rather than yellow-seededness). Because he actually counted the numbers of offspring of each type, Mendel had reason to con- ceive of what are now called genes as carriers of hereditary traits. Current examples of how statistics can provide clues to cause-and-effect relations in the biological sciences are furnished by studies of the incidence of disease in city and country and among smokers and nonsmokers. Before 1887, it had been common to postulate a motionless "ether' as carrier of light waves. It should, then, have been possible to detect the motion of the earth through the ether: a light beam sent in the direc- tion of the earth's movement and reflected back should appear to travel a bit more slowly (relatively to the earth) than a beam sent transversely and reflected back. However, the famous Michelson-Morley experiment re- vealed no such difference in the speeds of the two beams. (Interference patterns showed whether the two speeds were the same; exact measurement entered into the design of the experiment.) This surprising negative result weakened the ether hypothesis and led Einstein to formulate his special theory of relativity. On the basis of his general theory cdf relativity, Einstein predicted a definite slight degree of gravitational deflection of starlight beams grazing the sun's surface. Measurement by comparing star photographs taken during a solar eclipse with photographs of the same stars taken with the sun out of the way yielded results supporting Einstein's theory. Einstein's general theory also implies a "slowing down of time" in intense gravitational fields. For example, an atom of sodium in an intense gravitational field should appear to vibrate more slowly and so emit a more reddish light than an atom of sodium on earth. This spectral shift would be too slight for detection ordinarily, but it was finally observed</page><page sequence="5">Measurement as Scientific Method in Economics on the enormously dense companion star of Sirius. Einstein had pre- viously said that absence of the predicted shift would render his theory untenable. Astronomers had observed that Mercury did not revolve in its elliptical orbit with the regularity of the other planets: the orbit advances by 43 seconds of arc per century. This deviation could not be explained within the Newtonian theory but proved in agreement with the predictions of Einstein's more exact theory. These last examples illustrate the importance of precision in measure- ment in the natural sciences. Very slight quantitative differences may be decisive on qualitative issues such as the validity of an entire theory. "Im- portant advances in science are based on quantitative measurements only if the measured quantity is large as compared with possible systematic and accidental errors."5 III The Contrast in Economics IN ECONOMICS, no numerical constants occur.6 Econometric parameters are vastly different from constants that force themselves on natural scientists in repeated experiments. When econometricians-or their statistical clerks -manage to get some numbers or other for the parameters postulated in theoretical equations, they are hardly blending observation and theory the way natural scientists do. Forcing statistics into a theoretical Procrustean bed is a far cry from experimental testing of theories. People who believe in constants and dependable numerical relations in economics should be asked to name some (and it will not do merely to name relations that have held true fairly well on the average in particular countries during particular periods). Measurement of various elasticities, propensities, multipliers, monetary velocities, capital-output ratios, income- distribution parameters, and so forth is analogous not to measurement of the constant of universal gravitation or the mechanical equivalent of heat but rather to measurements at particular times of the flow of water in particular gutters, the temperature of particular electric light bulbs, the rainfall in particular localities, and the strain on particular bridges. Of course, measurements regarding human history may hold more interest than corresponding measurements of particular physical phenomena. It might be argued that economic affairs can in principle be quantitatively 5 James B. Conant, On Understanding Science (New York, New American Library, 1951), p. 99, where the quoted sentence is in italics. 6 This point has been much emphasized by Ludwig von Mises; see, for example, his Human Action (New Haven, Yale University Press, 1949), pp. 55-6, 118, 348-9. 341</page><page sequence="6">342 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology described or predicted by stable functional relations, provided the functions include all relevant variables. However, everyone knows from personal experience that people's economic behavior depends on innumerable fac- tors, including "noneconomic" factors for which no quantitative expression has been devised. Hence description of economic activity by stable func- tional relations would have to be merely one aspect of such description of the entire course of all human affairs. A leading difference between the theoretical cores of economics and the natural sciences has to do with where empirical fact comes in. It comes in at the beginning of chains of deductive reasoning much more im- portantly in economics than in the natural sciences: ".. while at the world of nature we look from the outside, we look at the world of society from the inside; while, as far as nature is concerned, our concepts are about the facts and have to be adapted to the facts, in the world of society at least some of the most familiar concepts are the stuff from which that world is made."7 In the natural sciences the underlying uniformities and structures-atoms, electrons, forces, gravitational fields, electromagnetic waves, and the like-cannot be observed directly. They are postulates whose legitimacy can only be inferred from the success of theories in coordinating what can be observed.8 It is precisely because the postulates of theory cannot be confirmed directly that measurement has its great importance in the natural sciences. Instead of direct confirmation, consequences are logically or mathematically deduced from the postulates; and these deduced consequences are sub- jected to empirical check. The examples in section II above show why such a check typically involves measurement.9 Measurement plays a more modest role in economics. Often we cannot check economic theorems in the complex "real," or "macro," world be- cause the effects of numerous influences are hopelessly intermingled. Fortunately, however, we can check economic theorems in another way-a way not available to natural scientists. We check the postulates directly. That is, we start the chains of deductive reasoning from dependable knowledge, as of the scarcity of productive resources in relation to practic- ally unlimited human needs and wants, of the law of diminishing returns, and of human motives and wants and choices.10 (For example: Other ?

The more of some consumer good a person has beyond a certain amount, the less importance does he attach to still further units of it, relative to other goods.) In forming theories, we can sort out the influences of various factors on economic affairs because we know from personal experience how people react. We believe our economic theorems because they are logically im- plied by empirically verified postulates. Yet, disappointing though it may be to would-be imitators of the natural sciences, these postulates are qualitative rather than numerical truths. Of course, the choice of empirical postulates about conditions of pro- duction and about human behavior involves abstraction. All theory, in the natural as well as social sciences, involves abstraction.ll How, then, can economists be sure of having made the right abstractions or simplifi- cations? For one thing, the same direct knowledge of themselves and other people from which economists draw empirical postulates also gives them insight into how sensitively the conclusions of a particular piece of analysis depend on the simplifying assumptions used. For example, in analyzing the effects of a new excise tax, it should not be too hard to see whether businessmen's desire for profit or their desire for prestige is brought more directly into play. If, however, a particular theory could not be reconciled with observed "objective" phenomena, then economists would have to reconsider their simplifying assumptions. In any case, the fact remains that economists can draw on microempirical knowledge of a sort denied to natural scientists. A further reason for emphasis in economics on empirical knowledge of human motives and choices lies in the very nature of scientific explana- tion. Science aims to order our experience, to reveal apparently uncon- nected observations as particular instances of a few wide principles, to deduce the greatest possible number of empirical facts from a few hypo- theses or axioms.l2 To explain something means to show how it exempli- fies or results from principles so widely applicable or so familiar that we of Northrop's book; Lionel Robbins, An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Eco- nomic Science (2d ed., London, Macmillan, 1948); Carl Menger, Untersuchungen iiber die Methode der Socialwissenschaften und der Politischen Oekonomie insbesondere (Leipzig, Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1883); Henry George, The Science of Political Economy (New York, Schalkenbach, 1941); and C. Weststrate, Theorie van drie stelsels van sociaal- economisch leven (Leiden, Stenfert Kroese, 1948), pp. 20-44. 11 A corollary is that a theory is not to be tested according to the full descriptive accuracy of its assumptions.

Explanation, as described above, is correlated with ability to make pre- dictions, understood as valid if-this-then-that propositions. (Neither in the natural sciences nor in economics does prediction, in general, mean fore- telling the future.) The above discussion admittedly allots an important role in economics to something that behaviorists scorn-introspection. But can introspection be banished completely from any field of knowledge? How can we avoid interpreting our sensations in the light of introspective experience? When we think we see a number indicated by a pointer on a dial, or when we think we are reading an article about a scientific experiment, how do we know that our sensations relate to an external world rather than to purely subjective fantasies? Surely introspection plays a part in our making this distinction. If introspection plays a more overt and important role in economics than in the natural sciences, may this not be due to the nature of the subject matter? It is understandable that to people trained in the natural sciences, the method of economic theory may smack of Kantianism and its synthetic a priori. Such suspicions are strengthened by the unfortunate fact that some economists do try to generate knowledge from sterile definition- juggling and from arbitrary, nonempirical assumptions on which their conclusions sensitively depend. But economists who induce principles of human motives and choice from personal experience are using widely applicable empirical facts capable of supporting chains of deductive reason- ing. Anthropomorphism, rightly scorned in the natural sciences as pre- scientific metaphysics, is justified in economics because economics is about human action.

Statistics is a powerful tool of research into economic history. Quantitative economic history of the very recent past may, with some risk, be projected for use in policy formation. Statistics can suggest fields for theoretical research (by pointing out, for example, the greater cyclical variability of capital-goods production than of consumer-goods produc- tion). Statistical and historical research may determine the presence or absence of the conditions to which particular theories relate. Statistical work may help in judging the relative strengths of opposing influences described by theory. For example, one strand of theory teaches that the risks of a fluctuating exchange rate hamper international trade; another strand teaches that a rate which always equilibrates supply and demand is more conducive to trade than a fixed and hence often disequilibrium rate. Which influence has been the stronger in particular experiences with fluctuating rates? Theory suggests that speculation may moderate ex- change-rate fluctuations if speculators expect early reversals of rate move- ments; speculation may intensify fluctuations if speculators see movements as the start of continuing trends. Which behavior has predominated in a particular historical episode? Statistics may help answer questions like these. (Judging the relative strengths of influences already understood qualitatively is, however, hardly the role of measurement in the natural sciences. There, measurement is essential to provide clues about even the qualitative state of affairs.) From statistics economists may, with luck, even discover fairly dependable uniformities among similar historical situations. Finally, statistical and historical material can lend definiteness and expository strength to primarily theoretical discussions. v Different Methods for Different Subjects THIS PAPER does not attack measurement in economics. It simply attacks naive exhortations to concentrate on gathering numbers. It shows why economists, who must be concerned with the behavior of people and not merely of things, can have little hope of finding stable numerical laws and constants (as distinguished from numerical facts of history). It shows how the essential function of measurement in the natural sciences is largely replaced in economics by direct empirical knowledge of the most generally applicable principles and concepts. It is tyrannical-and shall we say unscientific ?-to insist on mechanic- ally transplanting natural-science methods, narrowly conceived, into a field where the subject matter is quite different. Paradoxically, those who are 345</page><page sequence="10">346 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology loudest in insisting on what they take to be "inductive" methods are most given to a priori methodological sermonizing and least willing to learn from experience what methods have been most fruitful in economics.

America's Material Progress "IN MANY WAYS those of us now passing middle age have within our life- time experienced a greater advance in our material standard of living and a more pervasive change in our way of life than occurred in all the pre- vious centuries of Western history," says the Twentieth Century Fund study, America's Needs and Resources: A New Survey, by J. Frederic Dewhurst and associates. And to what is this due? Mainly to the advances made in technology, according to the report. "Technology, in fact, can be thought of as the nation's primary resource," says Dr. Dewhurst. "Without it all other resources would be economically nonexistent. This is clearly true of industrial and commercial facilities and of improved agricultural land. But it is also true of coal and oil, of iron ore, and of all the raw materials we obtain from the earth, the forests and the oceans. These are potential resources; they become actual resources only as technology makes it possible to extract them and convert them into useful products." It is especially striking to realize that the immense changes which tech- nology has wrought have benefited the great mass of people. In every past age and civilization only the favored few were able to enjoy a high standard of living, because they alone could command the lavish personal service to make it possible. But today Americans share the highest stand- ard of living the world has ever known. "Worth mentioning is the fact that this momentous development has been taking place not in communist Russia but in capitalist America. Of all the great industrial nations, the one that clings most tenaciously to private capitalism has come closest to the socialist goal of providing abun- dance for all in a classless society."</page></plain_text>
