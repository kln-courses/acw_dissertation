<plain_text><page sequence="1">MISCELLANEOUS NOTES AND NEWS "Matter of Glory" John Peter Rumrich's Matter of Glory (Pitts burgh, PA: U of Pittsburgh P, 1987) excited me because it goes the furthest yet toward explaining Milton's conception of God the Father in Para dise Lost—both why the Father is as he is, and why that poses problems to the reader of the poem. My sole regret is that Rumrich does not go fur ther still. First, when Milton's "glory" renders a Hebrew word, is it only ever Kabod being rendered? But secondly, when a Roman view of glory is felt, "glory" will probably include as a central signifi cation the element of exulting. To "glory" in Latin is to boast, and this explains how laughter is a "sudden glory." Hence Satan's worry about glory—someone may have the laugh on him. And hence, thirdly, the Father becomes prob lematic. When he "has his foes in derision" the Hebrew glory concurs with the Roman, only too anthropomorphically. Such glory expresses pow er, but lacks dignity. Now Rumrich's analysis shows why the prob lem is less acute to the reader of the Bible. Of Kabod, he sees the "primary" meaning as "God himself, the infinitely weighty source and gover</page><page sequence="2">90 MILTON QUARTERLY nor of all existence." But he sees, too, a second ary meaning, "that of praise—[implying] the duty of creatures to respond to their Creator by ex pressing their gratitude." And so, reading in the Bible that God exults over enemies or proclaims his own Kabod, we read whatever would be offen sive or anthropomorphic in the primary meaning as belonging to the secondary one, which is that of the cult out of which the text arises and which it feeds. No such adjustment can be made by the read ers of Paradise Lost. The Father there reads like other characters of epic in general and of this epic in particular. What is more, the reader of the Bible makes due allowance for development in Israel's image of God. A different image emerges from differ ent parts of the Bible, which indeed conducts a clarifying conversation about it. Not so in Para dise Lost, whose God the Father is exceedingly synchronic: primitive and anthropomorphic traits from the Bible may help to make him a charac ter, but detract from the worth of the composite image. And if Milton does not show Dante's tact in Paradise Lost, here is found one more reason why he followed up with the more hidden Father of Paradise Regained, and the very hidden one of Samson Agonistes. Of course Rumrich's argument does not imply these arguments of mine; but it encourages them by its evidence, and by its concluding openness. And he probes the contradictions at the heart of the Father more deeply, to my mind, than any one else I have read. John K. Hale University of Otago</page></plain_text>
