Conventional concerns of urban design are examined, leading to a discussion of the components and processes in the physical environment. More detailed comments concerning microclimate, vegetation, and water and soils as design factors are discussed. Regulatory implications are raised in conclusion. Urban design: achieving livable cities Urban design is the synthesis of the physical form of the city to achieve goals related to a range of human needs, particularly to activity and meaning. It deals with physical form, buildings, streets, parks etc., and the relationship between these, in order to achieve functional, cognitive, social and environmental goals. It has a particular emphasis on the quality of the public realm and on the cultural, economic and institutional forces and influences that impinge on design decisions. Urban design may operate at the scale of the region, the metropolis, district, or site (see Fig. I).1 The planning literature of the past several years has contained many 'manifestos' of what constitutes good urban design.2 Most often they are in the form of a check list, with the stated or implied purpose of improving the livability of urban areas and the design of public places in particular. In part these statements arise out of research into how people live in and enjoy particular parts of the city. Appleyard's study of how the amount of traffic in a street influences the formation of friendships in that street, is a typical example.3 Appleyard and Jacobs subsequently published a manifesto, wherein they spell out their 'goals for urban life'.4 Most of the statements, however, are more like responses to issues encountered during particular design projects. This type of statement tends to highlight the need for clear design objectives when decisions concerning the public realm are being made. Examples of this type include Miriam Gusevich's 'Meaning and Means in Urban Design'5 and Tibbalds' 'Mind the Gap-.

Careful retention of nineteenth-century buildings, but inappropriate public domain; with activity and quality absent, meanings become elusive Urban Design in the Late Twentieth Century'6 It is in this category also that recent monographs tend to make their point, the most cogent being Responsive Environ ments7 This text emphasises achieving the link between theory and practice and outlines a series of design methods, to help ensure that theory concepts are properly applied. The text can be seen as making the application of theory a more direct and effective process, building on antecedents such as Unwin8 and Sitte.9 The publication of A New Theory of Urban Design by Chris Alexander10 is very much in the form of deriving design goals in response to design issues and does not have a theory basis, despite the title. Indeed, it is the contention of the present author that there is very little of urban design that can be properly called 'theory' and that advances in knowledge in urban design are almost totally derived from the evaluation of built projects. There are simply too many variables operating to be able to set up 'experiments' from which predictive theories might be derived. There may be elements of urban design that can be treated experimentally, but even if all elements are fully considered, the essential synthesis still relies on the designer's skill. The core characteristic of urban design is the synthesis of form, and that is a process as much as a product, although the process needs to lead to a product if the benefit of the process is to be realised. Conventional concerns in urban design What, then, are the major concerns of urban design? The primary focus is on the design of place. There is a clear shift away from the individual building, for example, towards a more integrated streetscape, with an emphasis on usable public places and human scale, heritage retention, traffic calming and landscape, so that the place has a sense of identity (Fig. 2). This focus also includes the concept of free and equal open access for the pedestrian, unencumbered by barriers, with a</page><page sequence="3">URBAN DESIGN AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 405 Fig. 2 Footpath Bar, Norwood, South Australia. Skilful design to meet the needs of pedestrians: seating, shade, lighting, bollards (protecting customers from errant traffic) rejection of the privatisation of public areas, typified by enclosed shopping malls and walled residential encalves. A second theme in urban design is that of contextualism. This often abused idea revolves around the concept that no one element of a city should be too different from the texture of the city as a whole, that change to the fabric of a city should directly reflect its inheritance. The morphology of the city becomes a starting point for design objectives. The essential concept is that what is worthwhile about the character of a city as a whole has a public value, is a shared resource and as such should not be abrogated by sectionalist interests. This is one concept where there is considerable disputation, particularly by those parties which have an ideological or financial position in favour of elitist (non-democratic) processes. Contextualism is also seen as operating at the scale of the individual building,11 although the present author would argue that this can, and often does, lead to pastiche. It also raises the point that the future form of a city may not necessarily be an extension of the past, but clearly the underlying form and function of a city is one starting point.12 In contrast, urban designers often emphasise the need for a stimulating mix of form and land use. The point is often made that modernist urban form lacks the casual intermix of multiple use and informal opportunities for social intercourse, and there is a secondary concern that too often one place is all too much like many others, particularly in the suburbs, and this leads to a lack of identity and indeed can confuse the occasional visitor. Also, in a general sense, a change in thinking is occurring as to what urban design needs to achieve. While there has been strong concern with matters of architec tonics, appearance, townscape and decorative effect,13 there is increasing concern with the ways in which pressing contemporary issues can be addressed, such as supply of low-price housing, urban renewal, environmental protection, equity and</page><page sequence="4">406 DAMIEN MUGAVIN Fig. 3 City Square, Swanston Street, Melbourne, Victoria. An elegant design, but lacking vitality (design: Dent?n Corker Marshall) accessibility. There is also a shift away from central city design to matters that affect the suburbs, with initiatives such as the Model Residential Code14 that aim at redirecting the pattern of suburban development. Within this refocusing it is recognised that even the most carefully devised setting may be less than ideal as a place to live. Indeed, most urban areas seem to have informal gathering places, not planned for in any real sense, that capture the very essence of what it is that makes for a vital and interesting urban experience. And the converse also appears often to be the case: planned public places that are dreary, ugly and deserted (Fig. 3). Indeed, Peter Rowe has argued that there is a new morphology in the contemporary (American) city, unrelated to European prece dents, in the form of a proliferation of isolated objects, with ubiquitous public spaces filled with freeways and car-parks, having no specific cultural value relating to locale or historical circumstances.15 He includes much of suburbia in this genre. It is beyond dispute that the livability' of any specific city has a lot to do with the cultural norms existing among the residents, and urban design therefore needs deeply to reflect these norms. Indeed, one pertinent argument is that the design professionals?architects and planners?have too readily imported and imposed irrelevant and spurious design ideologies that conflict with local cultural norms and the environmental context. There is every indication that, in matters of urban design, an insistence on parochialism is often the best option, notwithstanding the intimidatory position adopted by head office in London or Tokyo. Urban design, therefore, has a clear materialist perspective, both in terms of goals and outcomes. It is also very clearly a political process, if only because there is a claim being made for public values. It also has an economic agenda, for the same reason. And in a practical sense, urban design is seen as needing to be deeply rooted in the social and environmental context.</page><page sequence="5">URBAN DESIGN AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 407 Natural systems: some important components and processes in the physical environment In the foregoing discussion, the importance of the physical environment, and its relationship to urban design, has been mentioned several times: it is a core issue, and one that is increasingly influencing design decisions. The reason it is so important arises out of links to prime concerns of urban design: the retention of local character (a crucial element of which is the physical environment) and the positive contribution that the components and processes of the physical environ ment can make to the richness of urban areas as human habitat. A city's natural environment and its urban form, taken together, comprise a record of the interaction between natural processes and human purpose over time. Together they contribute to each city's unique identity.16 It may be difficult to discern the patterns of nature in the modern city with its density of people and buildings, polluted air, paved expanses, vegetation com pletely supplanted by exotic cultivars, the population pumped up on imported food, water, and energy. But although vastly altered, the natural components and processes still offer 'a constellation of opportunities'.17 Clearly there is a need to recognise the fact that there is no way to turn back to nature in the sense of reversing the development process, or forcing the abandonment of modern industrial society. Indeed, there are strong arguments supporting the contention that the integration of natural and human imperatives is both necessary and realistic. We need to relearn that 'the environment' is not some almost mystical apparition; it is where we live. In addressing the issue of which of the almost infinite aspects of the physical environment should be accounted for in urban design, it would be easy but impractical to argue that all processes and components should be examined in detail. Experience shows, for example, that a comprehensive description of all aspects of the environmental system is not necessary, and indeed can be wasteful of time and resources. An informed judgement needs to be made about what is directly relevant, and this can normally be done following a preliminary review of the particular locality and the proposed project. This argument underscores the point that even at a general level, no two proposals are exactly the same. The character of projects varies, even within a limited land use type, such as residential or industrial. As well, no two sites are the same, even if it is accepted that land characteristics can be rationalised in terms of patterns of physical environment (such as patterns in soil type, geology, topogra phy, vegetation etc.).18 Additionally, and very importantly, each proposal has its own set of 'external' influences such as financing arrangements, timing, profit expectation, community opinion etc., any one of which can directly affect the likely outcome. Very clearly, each project has its own context and implications. None the less, it is possible to make some useful generalisations concerning how the urban design process needs to respond to the influences of the physical environment. Indeed, since European settlement began in Australia, designers have not, it is argued, learnt to respond intelligently to the influences of the physical environment. Instead, with very few exceptions, they have tended to see it as something to overcome or ignore, and residential development in particular</page><page sequence="6">408 DAMIEN MUGAVIN clearly reflects this. In a general sense the primary areas of concern, where the deficiencies in urban design in relation to physical environment lay, are all too obvious. Those areas of concern are in relation to microclimate, vegetation and water and soils.19 MICROCLIMATE At a micro scale, climate sets the level of physical comfort for the citizen, not only when enjoying the opportunities afforded by the public realm, but to some extent indoors as well. The elements of climate?precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, wind, humidity?affect directly the extent to which a particular place meets the needs of people in terms of both activities and meaning. In essence it is argued here that microclimate is a significant element of the character of a place. Recognition of this can provide direct and valid design responses that augment the enjoyment of place, adding to the depth of experience. Yet it often seems that urban form is curiously at odds with the microclimate in which it is set, not only the buildings but also the public realm. Wide shadeless expanses of black bitumen, shimmering in the summer heat, are almost a cliche of civic pride for many Australian cities. Plaza forecourts to city buildings seem to channel the full blast of winter wind right through anyone foolish enough to walk there. The lack of shelter in the bare emptiness of 20-metre wide residential streets means they poorly serve the pedestrian in both winter and summer, unless confined within the mechanical climate of the motor car, and even that is ill adapted to climate with its large expanse of glass (Fig. 4). Simple design ideas that recognise the importance of microclimate need to be built into the conception of all public (and private) open space. Trees can provide shade and shelter. Wind funnelling can be avoided. Suburban streets can be shaded and sheltered and brought into scale with their purpose. Access to solar Fig. 4 Burbridge Road, Adelaide, South Australia. Recent construction of a road that may meet traffic demand, but clearly the public realm has been neglected</page><page sequence="7">URBAN DESIGN AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 409 heating can be protected, including for both existing and infill residences during urban redevelopment. Deering20 has argued that there is a double effect when considering the influence of shade trees on comfort conditions, in circumstances of excessive heat gain. Under a tree canopy, the passage of solar (radiant) heat is significantly reduced as it is intercepted by the tree for the processes of photosynthesis and transpiration. Additionally, part of the heat is reflected from the leaf surface. Deering21 also argues for the use of deciduous vines to shade vertical surfaces, particularly those facing the setting sun. VEGETATION Since the eighteenth century trees have been used as structuring elements in the morphology of cities. Detroit, strange as it may seem today, had laws requiring a double line of trees on both sides of 120 ft avenues and in residential squares.22 The use of trees in this fashion grew out of the French Baroque garden, and is seen in the morphology of many of the great cities developed or rebuilt in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries: Paris, Washington, Melbourne. The pattern includes landscape parks, broad tree-lined radiating avenues, and treed residential squares, often superimposed over a pre-existing pattern of natural and/or cultural resources. The English Landscape tradition also contributed to the inclusion of trees in urban areas. Suburbs designed by Frederick Law Olmsted in Chicago were based on the work of Paxton at Birkenhead, for example. It is the role of trees as structural elements that is the important idea in each of these precedents. Indeed, I think it can be argued that to the extent that structure planting has been deleted from the main road23 and freeway network, cities have lost one of the most important urban design ideas: a sense of pattern (Fig. 5). This loss of pattern is Fig. 5 Princes Highway, Warrnambool, Victoria. Median planting of ficus and araucaria, about ninety years old, imparts a three dimensional pattern to the road</page><page sequence="8">410 DAMI?N MUGAVIN accentuated when the lower order streets, under the auspices of local government, have become miniaturised boulevards of formal planting that might be read as important civic avenues instead of as local multi-use streets. This is not to argue that the less important streets should not have trees, but that the trees should help impart an indication of the street's level in the hierarchy of roads. And it is in the interstices of the city where other valued attributes of vegetation can be asserted: habitat retention, stormwater treatment,24 erosion prevention, microclimate effects, food and timber production. One potentially very influential constraint on tree planting in urban areas is the provisions of Australian Standard AS2870-1986, Residential Slabs and Footings25 This document severely limits the planting of large trees where expansive soils have been encountered. Wyatt26 argues that this Standard, making recommendations purely on the basis of the mature height of large trees, is both simplistic and inaccurate. No account is taken of the fact that the potential for structural damage by tree roots has a very tenuous link with the mature height of the tree, whatever that means, given that the major problem is the variation in soil moisture level, rather than a direct loading on the slab by the growth of the tree root, which should be a relatively rare problem. It also needs to be recognised that the householder would normally have a reasonable expectation of being able to plant a garden, including trees, and it is folly to base slab design on the assumption that trees will not be planted. Clearly the retention, reinstatement and maintenance of vegetation in urban areas is no easy matter, particularly where associated with freeways, arterial roads and streets. But to neglect them is to neglect a basic element of urban design and undervalues the potential of the urban area concerned. Neglect also by implication gives higher value to such matters as traffic flow and allotment yield, undoubtedly matters that all too easily usurp balanced planning decisions. WATER AND SOILS Water and soil are resources, substances that directly affect the health and well being of the human population. But this is not all that apparent when looking at the ever expanding urban areas of the world. So often the very best productive soils and valued water catchments are subsumed by urban expansion. Additionally, the husbanding of these resources within built-up areas is generally neglected, frequently overtly polluted with official sanction. The relationship between urban design and these resources may not be directly apparent, but if there is to be a recognition of the value of these resources by conserving them in urban areas, then it is clearly apparent that urban form will need to adapt to achieve that goal. This may mean, for example, that provision will need to be made to harvest and clean stormwater run-off in urban wetlands so that the water can be re-used, perhaps for industrial or horticultural purposes.27 In a similar manner, urban development may need to allow for the conservation of productive soils, even though this may not provide the highest direct investment return on the basis that the latter is a very poor measure of the long-term value of the resource (Fig. 6). These 'conservation priority' areas need not be totally excluded from urban development, but careful planning and innovative techniques</page><page sequence="9">URBAN DESIGN AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 411 Fig. 6 Urban fringe horticulture. Dandenong Ranges, east of Melbourne, Victoria. The special value of soil resource might impinge on design options would need to be applied to their development and ongoing management. They may indeed become very special areas, recognised as places with some cherished character and valued for that reason. The conservation of water and soil resources may also impinge on design options at the site and local street level in that both need to be retained, kept clean, and re-used. It is odd indeed that both these resources are imported in vast quantities, at great cost to the 'donor sites' and to the consumer, when both might be so readily available were simple conservation measures implemented. Professor lohn Argue has estimated, for example, that in Adelaide, where rainfall is only 533 mm per year, on-site collection of rainwater and re-use of'grey' water could mean a 70 per cent reduction in the summer water demand of domestic consumers, notwithstanding the very high level of consumption of water, particularly for garden watering.28 Regulatory implications The application of many of these concepts will probably require that they are mandatory. The 'public good'29 element in most of these concepts is so high that it is both inefficient and impractical to leave implementation to the individual or the investor. However, it also needs to be noted that to apply these ideas in a blanket fashion, without due understanding of local conditions, and without strong community support, is likely to be very counter-productive, and as in other examples of inappropriate planning regulation, is likely to lead to calls for their complete abolition. The controls need to be carefully and appropriately directed at specific, locally important issues, and based on very thorough assessment of the processes and components in the physical environment. This suggests that each local planning authority needs methodically to set about</page><page sequence="10">412 DAMI?N MUGAVIN establishing an environmental information system, along with goals, policies and performance criteria that respond to that information, recognising the point that urban design decisions are perhaps best made through a process of negotiation. In the Australian context, it is rare indeed to find a local authority with such goals and policies, which perhaps partly explains why so much urban design in Australia is not only derivative but also strangely at odds with local conditions.
