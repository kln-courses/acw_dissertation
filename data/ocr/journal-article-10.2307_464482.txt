<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Colonial Outsider: "Malgerie" in Helene Cixous's Les reveries de la femme sauvage Jennifer Yee University of Newcastle Portrayals of the psychology of colonialism have generally concentrated on the relationship between colonizer and colonized, inspired in part by the Hegelian dialectics of the master and the slave, or on the troubled response of the colonized him/herself.' One of Helene Cixous's recent works of fiction, Les re^veries de la femme sauvage (2000),2 in which for the first time she deals directly with her childhood experiences in Algeria, sketches the predicament of a third party, the outsider who is innocent and yet implicated in the colonial system that condemns her to a necessarily false position. The darkness of this essentially paralyzing situation is offset by playful language, which-in this brooding return to an Algerian child- hood (1946 to 1956)-is a constant reminder of a fresh, childlike creativ- ity and resilience.3 This play on language is no doubt one of the reasons why Cixous's fiction has received much less attention in the English- speaking world than her feminist theory.4 It does indeed seem a doubtful undertaking to translate it, and any analysis, such as I will nevertheless try to give in this article, must necessarily weigh down what is, by essence, light and jouissif. This particular text uses linguistic play and invention in the depiction of a certain situation-that of the colonial outsider-in a way that is particularly revelatory, as we shall see. One of the most striking techniques of Cixous's writing is the reduction of words to the level of mere phonemic objects, which can then be recom- bined to create particularly expressive neologisms. Phonemic resemblances are used to weave together strands of meaning across different linguistic domains. A striking example is the founding wordplay of the text. The nar- rator is a writer who has finally decided to write about her childhood in Algeria. Having lost some crucial pages written during the night in a rush of inspiration, she feels that her body, bereft, is transformed into pain: she is "une algie" (p. 16). This pain (algie) resembles her "maladie algerie" (p. 16); it is the "force malgerienne" of her imagination that has left her cov- ered in scars (pp. 111, 124). "Malgerie" or the adjective malgerien/ne is an unusually rich example of a mot-valise or portmanteau word that includes more than a mere two meanings: as well as echoing algie (pain), it implies a mal d'Algerie, which can mean both pain in general and a variation of the 189</page><page sequence="2">mal d'amour ('pain of love'), so the narrator is both in pain and in love; casually it evokes but does not succumb to the pied-noir5 nostalgia of mon Algerie ('my Algeria'); it also refers to a double sickness, the narrator's own maladie d'Algerie (her sickness in and of Algeria) and Algeria's sickness, the maladie d'Alge'rie that the child learns much later to ascribe to "l'Algeriefran,aise" (p. 144), as distinct from the other Algeria. These reveries ('daydreams') thus encompass both a love story and the diagnosis of a sickness. Here, then, is a tale of unrequited love or worse: love rejected and answered with its opposite. The children in the story-the narrator-as- child and her brother, the original couple, like the two halves of a her- maphrodite seen before, during, and after a painful separation-suffer from their desire for Algeria and their inability to enter it, to belong to it. This double passion (love and suffering) for Algeria takes the form of a perpet- ual war with the most immediate objects of their love, the Arab children from the neighboring slums, or the "petizarabes" (pp. 45, 72; from petits arabes, 'little Arabs'). The brother and sister, although they are not part of French colonial society, live within the colonial system: they cannot be Arab, but they cannot bring themselves not to be Arab; they are "inse- parabe" (pp. 45, 89). "Inseparabe" is another mot-valise implying the words inseparable ('inseparable') and arabe ('arab')-but also giving a distant echo of sepharade-Sephardim-the North African Jewish community to which the narrator's father belonged, or rather in-s6pharade, excluded from that community: the children's father is dead and their mother, a German Jew, is Ashkenazi and not Sephardi). "Inseparabes," the brother and sister can- not stop themselves from reaching out to Algerian Algeria in the form of their neighbors, the Arab children, but their desire is doomed to failure- it is their "Desalgerie" ('Disalgeria,' with overtones of desolation, p. 69). The objects of their desire necessarily reject them as implicated in the colonial system, their love is unrequited, and they experience Punishment without having committed a Crime, just as the family's second-hand library contains the second volume of Dostoievsky's novel but not the first (p. 83). This doomed love story emerges through wordplay around certain crucial symbols. The first of these symbols to enter the story is the children's bike, an image of hope and the focus of dreams for years before its arrival. For them, the bike appears a way of entering Algeria, the real Algeria: it represents a way out of their stalemate or, rather, a Way In. The desire for the bike pro- longs, with all the appearance of the same inevitable frustration, the chil- dren's desire for the return of their father after his death: "il y a des prieres qui restent sans reponse, le Velo ne venait pas, comme mon pere ne venait pas" (p. 28; 'there are unanswered prayers, the Bike didn't come, as my 190</page><page sequence="3">father didn't come'), a parallel that does much to encourage the feeling that the bike-"le Velo," with a capital "v"-is a long-awaited messiah. Cixous's capitalization of common nouns makes them into proper nouns and indeed characters in their own right. This anthropomorphism and the childish aspect of the object give a humorous balance to the seriousness of the symbolic content it bears. As with the Jewish messiah, though they wait for the Bike at each birthday or feast day, "II ne vient pas. I1 n'etait pas venu" ('It [He] doesn't come. It [He] didn't come') or even with a rit- ualistic repetition, "II ne vient pas, il ne vient pas, il ne vient pas, et c'est comme cela qu'un velo devient tout pour nous, par une nonvenance record" (p. 29; 'and that is how a bike has become everything for us, through its record uncoming'). Nonvenance: another neologism, this time formed by grammatical composition; the uncoming of the longed-for, mes- sianic bike makes it a symbol of the impossibility of entering in, of achiev- ing oneness with the real Algeria. And when the "Velo" does come, it comes for the brother only. He will ride the desired "Velo" to penetrate the other Algeria, though only at a high cost to himself, for he must undergo a symbolic castration to do so: their mother, insensitive to his male pride, has bought a woman's bike. Despite this, the children insist that it is not a mere (feminine) "bicyclette" (p. 39), as their too-pragmatic German- Jewish mother would have it: it is a "velo," "le velo" (masculine). This vir- ile "Velo," in addition to promising a way into Algeria itself, appears in all the glory of its phonemic echoes: "le nom de Velo chantait tout ce que nous adorions consciemment ou pas, aussi bien la Vitesse que l'eau le lot, le V de la Victoire, le vais d'aller" (p. 22; 'Velo's name sang of everything that we adored consciously or not. . . '), Cixous continues, with a play on the sound [v] in "Vitesse" ('speed'), "Victoire" ('victory') and [je] "vais" ([I] 'go'), as well as the vowel sound [o] in "velo," "eau" ('water'), and "lot" ('prize'). The "velo" is also haut ('high' [o]), bringing ideas of escape in the wake of its sail (la voile, from the Latin velum), an aerial ascendant image opposed to the ideas of falling (tomber) and of death (la tombe). The play on words captures the significance of these things for the child. And yet to the sister, in the end, the bike gives nothing. It will in fact deprive her of her hermaphroditic unity with her brother who leaves her to enter Algeria, becoming "l'enfant envole avec velo" (p. 25; literally 'the child flown away with the bike'), but also a play on the fricatives [v] and [fl and on the repeated nasal vowel sound, as well as a phonemic chiasmus, "envole'," containing the inverted vowels of "velo" so that flight (or theft, also voler) becomes an integral attribute of the bike. She herself, once perched on the insecure height of the bike and in danger of falling (tomber), cannot bear the harassment that is the children's everyday expe- 191</page><page sequence="4">rience when they venture out into the streets of Algiers (pp. 52-53). The "Velo" is hope disappointed. Even less promising is the figure of the children's dog, a living image of their failure and suffering. The Dog (again with a capital, because there is only the one and will never be another) cannot be allowed out because he is their dog and would be "taken hostage" (p. 76) by the "petizarabes" in the perpetual war between them and the children. The Dog is locked up in a cage outside the house, and the enemies throw stones at him; he is not just a hostage of the "petizarabes" but, even more, a symbol of the children's rejected love. The Dog, a gift from their father shortly before his death, is their father's son, a figure of themselves-as-victim or another Christ-like figure left them by their Father, dying, to pay in their place for the sins they have not committed. The brother and sister are twice innocent-as children and as Jews, members of an excluded community-and yet they are necessarily impli- cated in the colonial system. They cannot be welcomed into the dreamt- of friendship with the "petizarabes" but must endure (indirectly, in the form of the Dog) their violence: though they are innocent, this friendship is not possible, and on the eve of war (which is implicitly imminent in the period remembered here), to use Sartre's words, "ce dechainement barbare et fou ne les epargne pas plus que les mauvais colons" 6 ('this mad barbaric explosion spares them no more than it does the bad colonists'), or, as Albert Memmi puts it, when the time comes, the colonized reacts by rejecting the colonizers and "all those who resemble them, everything that is not, like him, oppressed."7 The Dog's mad howling from its cage is the song of the children's agonized exclusion, transferred metonymically onto this scapegoat(-dog). In his untiring rage, the Dog is "unforgettable": "et Le voila. Voila Le Chien mon frere nie, le plus miserable des dieux" (p. 73; 'and here He is. Here is The Dog my denied brother, the most miserable of gods'). The Dog is a figure of complete exclusion, locked up by his brother and sister, stoned by his enemies, and unable to defend himself: the Dog is Hell (p. 77) or, with his ticks and his suffering, Job (p. 81). As we move along the strands of this writing, we learn that the narra- tor-as-child will never penetrate the real Algeria on the "Veo"; but she also desires its possession in the form of The Doll, seen in a shop window and inaccessible because of her father's inability to understand its impor- tance. The Doll is a Mauresque, complete with veil and jewelery, hidden body and face, which she bums ambiguously to be or to possess (p. 135) and for which she would have sold her soul (p. 92). This thwarted, impos- sible need to possess "la mauresque" is the same desire that she feels for Aicha the housemaid, whom she holds in the arms of her childish love for a short moment each morning (p. 14). If she has known Algeria at all, it 192</page><page sequence="5">is in the form of Aicha, on whose lap she sits, "la seule Algerie que j'aie jamais pu toucher frotter retoucher tater palper arquer mon dos a son mol- let fourrer ma bouche entre ses seins ramper sur ses pentes epicees" (p. 90; 'the only Algeria that I have been able to touch rub touch again feel fin- ger arch my back against her calf push my mouth between her breasts crawl on her spiced slopes'). "J'etais sur elle, dis-je. Mais je n'ai jamais ete chez elle" (p. 90; 'I was on her [lap], as I say. But I have never been to her home'): the child, in love with Aicha's algerianness and her womanliness (beside which her mother and grandmother appear somehow virile in their quick German efficiency), climbs on the woman's knees, but is not invited to her home. The contact is revealed to be even more superficial than it appeared: "Aicha," the beloved, sensual name, is not even her real name (p. 93), which is Messaouda. Despite their best intentions the family has fallen into the typically demeaning misnaming that is a cliche of bad colo- nial practice. In the end this reflects the fundamental failure of the narra- tor's desire for Aicha, whose very name slips from her grasp. Still more striking is the fact that desire for Algeria is repeatedly repre- sented in terms of desire for the sexual possession of a feminine figure, more readily available to the brother (who becomes more interested in Aicha's daughters than in their ever-pregnant mother) than to the sister. The ambiguity of this relation with Algeria for the girl-child appears in her double desire to be/to possess the Mauresque doll. It is only at the end (pp. 155-56) and in the unreality of a photo that she evokes the possibility of love the other way, of being united with a masculine Algeria in the shape of Kader the Kabyl (or was it Idir? again, there is a confusion of names that denies any appearance of solidity to the memory), who her brother said was a little in love with her. The photo, in which Kader/Idir and she appear together, stands for a might-have-been relationship, for which the world they lived in was not yet ready. Perhaps it is because of this sexual taboo that the potential union strikes a contrived note: the sexual symmetry (her brother knowing Algeria through its women, the narrator appearing beside Kader/Idir) is flawed. At moments Cixous appears to conceive of the desired oneness-with-Algeria as being consummated only through the sex- ual encounter with the "mauresque," as if these penetrations were symbol- ically equivalent, as they are in the old colonial cliche. The narrator does, however, leave a space for doubt: the brother's penetration of Algeria (on the "Velo," through its women) may be a mere figment of his imagination, while the narrator herself never resolves the question of identification or desire. A more traditional, repeated image is that of the door (la porte) or the gate (le portail) and the linked theme of bars and walls. While the other images-the "Velo," the Dog, the Doll-appear successively in the text 193</page><page sequence="6">(though not in the chronology of the story), the theme of the Door is omnipresent. The door and the children's position at the door reflect their false situation, waiting on the threshold of Algeria, so to speak, but refused entry. They are at once there and not there, at the door but not allowed in. For the brother, the door does open to some extent, as I have said, in the shape of the "Velo," which is a "wheeled door" (p. 54). When her brother passes over the threshold with the bike, his sister stands looking at him on the other side, but he steps back so that they are once again together on one side of the door, with the "petizarabes" on the other: the door is between the children with bread and the children without (p. 36). This door is also the gate through which, ashamed, the narrator-as-child passes a piece of bread to a small girl on the other side: not so much bread she has stolen to give, she says, as stolen bread returned to its rightful owner ("je rends du vole," p. 113). Once, also, before the death of the father, the door opens between the Arabs and them (this door is one that certainly seems to open more easily for men): driving with his children, the young Jewish doctor picks up two Arab hitchhikers to give them a lift down the hill: mon pere avait arrete I'auto en haut de la pente et nos deux humains trans- figures en meme temps que nous mon pere mon frere et moi, etaient descen- dus le cceur grand ouvert, la porte, la porte, disant merci tu es un frere merci mon frere dieu te benisse.... (p. 47) (my father had stopped the car at the top of the slope and our two trans- figured humans at the same time as us my father my brother and me, had come down it, hearts wide open, the door, the door, saying thank you you are a brother thank you my brother God bless you....) Like disguised angels or gods, the two guests are welcomed into the father's Citroen, in a moment of hope in the brotherhood of humanity: Le ciel etait naturellement puissamment bleu, nos dents de sourire etaient extremement blanches, nos compagnons bibliques, et 1a-dessus dieu est mort et le livre des portes s'est referme sur notre nez. (p. 47) (The sky was naturally powerfully blue, our smiling teeth were extremely white, our companions biblical, and thereupon God died and the Book of Doors closed in our faces.) The death of the father signals the closing of a door that, for the narrator, is only reopening now (in the present of the narration); writing the book is solely possible because of this slight opening. But for years she could only wait at the locked door, holding onto the bars, 'waiting for the message: a face, a door, a smile' (p. 89). This already polysemous door (it is not merely the open door of her desire for Algeria and the closed door of Algeria's rejection of her, but also 194</page><page sequence="7">the threshold separating those who have enough to eat from those who do not) stands opposite another door, this one unambiguously closed. The narrator-as-child waits outside the door of the house where her French schoolfriend lives, calling her name: Fran,oise (of course). She is banned from this house, with its high white walls surrounded by white earth, as she is kept out of the fortress of French white Algeria and away from the unam- biguously pure francite ('Frenchness') of "Fran,oise." There has been progress since the time of the Jewish mother's childhood in anti-Semitic Germany: the narrator-as-child is occasionally allowed to invite Fran,oise to her home, but she is never allowed to enter the white fortress/house. While the ambiguous image of the door separates (but remains open between) the brother-and-sister and the "petizarabes," the high walls of the white fortress keep them out of the anti-Semitic French community. The children are the object of several sorts of exclusion: by the Arabs, since Jews are the traditional internal aliens of Algerian society, and by the French colonists, since Algerian Jews, though given French citizenship in 1871, were the object of institutional antisemitism through special laws excluding Jews introduced by the Vichy government in June 1941. The children are also excluded from the Sephardic Jewish community itself because of the marginality of their Ashkenazi mother, to which is added the isolation of atheists living among practicing Jews and of the children of a widow in a culture working along strictly partriarchal lines. The nar- rator's state of exclusion is thus overdetermined: En plus du racisme fondateur francais du racisme racine raison socle piliers societe culture coutume en plus de cette inoculation congenitale triomphale de cette greffe tout ce qu'il y a de plus reussie et commune dans le monde en plus du classicisme francais, en plus de cette morbidit6 consider6e comme une belle sante, bon appetit, il faut ajouter les antisemitismes, lesquels naturellement s'additionnent entre eux. (p. 43) (As well as the founding French racism the racism root reason plinth pillars society culture custom as well as this triumphant congenital inoculation this graft as successful and everyday as anything in the world as well as this French classicism, as well as this morbidity considered as good health, good appetite, one must add the antisemitisms which, naturally, add up together.) The apposition of nouns after "racisme" does not simply add a metaphori- cal gloss to the word as it would with a more traditional use of punctuation that, separating the elements of the list, would tend to organize them hier- archically. Instead, the movement from one noun to the next is at once alliterative and thematic, so that each step adds a commentary to the one before and is echoed by what follows. Cixous's subversion of French classi- cal syntax (a comment in itself) allows her to achieve in these extremely brief passages a poetic density of meaning that offers an abstract analysis of 195</page><page sequence="8">the colonial situation. This clear-eyed vision of the workings of an inherently flawed system is available to the narrator-as-child thanks to her forced marginality. In the words of one of the characters of Salman Rushdie's latest novel, The Ground Beneath Her Feet, "what about outsideness? .. . The only people who see the whole picture . .. are the ones who step out of the frame."8 In Cixous's 1950s Algeria, the French colonists are blind to the writing on the wall, "Vous verrez" (p. 120; 'You will see'), as if it were written on a wall behind another wall. Thanks to the multiple exclusion of the narrator-as- child, she is able, indeed obliged, to step out of the frame of colonial soci- ety and see the ideological apparatus that is its necessary foundation. This is clearest and most damning in the passages where she is directly con- fronted with the institutions of the colony, in the form of her school. She has been enrolled, by mistake, in the French girls' high school (Lycee) that, since Vichy, has avoided Jews. One of the rare Jews in the Lycee, she is confronted every day with this other door, or rather this absence of Jews and Muslims (p. 123). In this school the pupils learn and repeat the "ini- tial secret programme," the "plan d'effacement de l'etre algerien" (p. 124; 'project of obliteration of Algerian being'). Rather than reading, writing, and arithmetic, they are taught "substitution, ablation, et fantomatisation" (p. 124; 'substitution, ablation, and phantomization'), and the Algerian being is "exorcised" or "excised" in a perfect physical and mental "disin- fection" that leaves an "enormous absence" (p. 124). The school is "une maladie reconnue d'utilite publique" (p. 147; 'a state-approved disease'). The narrator-as-child is new to this system since she had previously attended a temporary replacement school, excluded from the colonial sys- tem because of (thanks to) that other project, "l'effacement de l'e^tre juif' (p. 126; 'the obliteration of Jewish being'), which had also led the Vichy gov- ernment to prevent her father, a doctor, from exercising his profession. Now, however, she finds herself within the miniature colonial system of the Lycee, attending what she calls an "asile psychiatrique deguise obliga- toire" (p. 148; an 'obligatory disguised psychiatric asylum'). None of the other pupils appears to share her double vision. Her friend Fran,oise is a mere puppet, whose visits to the narrator's house are granted or not according to the arbitrary decisions of good anti-Semitic French society (p. 127). Only the narrator-as-child seems to see straight; in her Lycee, it is as if she has fallen into madness-someone else's madness-and everything has become as unreal as a puppet theater: Je souffre d'anachronie, c'est une maladie mentale banale familiere et red- outable: le malade n'est pas malade, il souffre de I'anachronie mentale de son entourage, il est entour6 de marionnettes manifestes, il est seul a voir que tout est inverse en sens contraire, inverse et pr6tendu etre dans I'autre sens. 196</page><page sequence="9">I y a un glissement mental et semantique general. Les dements se prennent pour les gens normaux. La contreverite jouit d'une autorite incontestee. Tout le monde croit ce qui n'est pas. Tout le monde non-voit ce qui est. Le pro- gramme est ininterrompu. (p. 143) (I am suffering from anachronia, it is a banal familiar fearsome mental dis- ease: the sufferer isn't sick, she suffers from the mental anachronia of her entourage, she is surrounded by blatant puppets, she is the only one to see that everything is reversed upside down, reversed and claiming to be the other way up. There is a general mental and semantic slippage. The de- mented believe themselves normal. Untruth has uncontested authority. Everyone believes what is not. Everyone unsees what is. The program is unin- terrupted.) The whole institution of "l'Algeriefran,aise" is condensed metonymically into the Lycee, which is at once a part of the institution (it is attended by the daughter of the Gouverneur General) and the means of its discursive perpetuation. Cixous's neologisms evoke an Orwellian doublespeak, just as her character sees double, living in the puppet theater and being the only one to see it for what it is. The sole solution, for the narrator-as-child, is to leave, but she is not old enough to do so and must wait in the "psychiatric asylum." While waiting, she invents a technique to answer the institu- tional "unseeing": she takes photos of the teachers with her father's broken camera, thus producing dozens of nonexistent photos. "Par ce moyen je les inexistais" (p. 149; 'Thus I nonexisted them'). Despite this clear-sightedness, it is impossible to remain uncontami- nated in the city of Algiers, a condensation of the absurdity of "l'Algeriefran,aise": "on ne peut pas faire un pas dans la rue ni entrer dans un magasin sans etre instantanement victime complice coupable ou cont- amine" (p. 41; 'it is impossible to take a step in the street or to enter a shop without being instantly victim accomplice guilty or contaminated'). And along with the puppet theater/psychiatric asylum/Lycee is the image of Algeria as a house with four floors, each floor representing one of its mixed identities, all of them false, "espagnole dite fran,aise allemande dite fran,aise juive dite fran,aise catholique dite fran,aise" (p. 139; 'Spanish known as French German known as French Jewish known as French Catholic known as French'). At the bottom of the house, under the stair- well, is the beggar Mohamed, crouching in the darkness (p. 11 and pp. 139-40). Mohamed is "l'ane de la maison": not (though nearly) "l'ame de la maison" ('the soul of the house') but 'the ass of the house,' the beast that carries the burdens and bears the blows. He is the messenger ("l'envoye"), the Muslim wandering Jew ("le juif errant musulman"): he is the Prophet and ("il est venu") the messiah (p. 139). He lives on charity, in the person of the third-floor granny: "Elle nourrit son. Son qui, son quoi, son hote son autre" (p. 140; 'She feeds her him. Her who, her what, her guest [or host], 197</page><page sequence="10">her other'). As ever, the phonetic games played by Cixous create untrans- latable parallels: between qui [ki] and quoi [kwa], and most of all between "hote" [ot] and "autre" [OtR], parallels that underline the paradox of the relationship between the charitable third-floor granny and the beggar, who is at one and the same time the other of the house and the basis of its con- struction. The terrible clarity of vision from which the narrator-as-child suffers is the result of her position as outsider: it is not that she is actually outside the system (that would be a utopian dream) but outside the dialectics of the master and the slave and in any case excluded from either community, from all communities. Does a marginal point of view-that of a Jew excluded from the Jewish community, living among Arabs and French colonists-make it possible to look on the colonial situation from else- where ... from the point of view of "humanity"? Memmi, writing from the position of a Tunisian Jew, tells of how his own attempts at dealing with this ambiguous position initially involved identifying himself as much as possible with the West and how he was thus compromised by colonialism: "Better still, or worse, depending on how you look at it, in this pyramid of petty tyrants that I have tried to describe, and that constitutes the skeleton of any colonial society, we found ourselves just one degree higher than our Muslim fellow citizens."9 Yet he does claim to be a kind of "half-breed" of colonization, able to understand all those involved because he belonged to no group in particular.10 However one might define this evidently-and fortunately-ill-defined and ill-definable vantage point, Cixous's fiction here concentrates on the marginality and exclusion of her subject from within colonial society. Although she does, as we have seen, underline the impossibility of remain- ing "uncontaminated" by the system, she herself attributes the birth of her writing to her marginality: "J'ai eu la chance d'avoir pour temps et lieu de naissance l'etrangete, l'exil, la guerre, le souvenir fantome de la paix, la douleur, le deuil" ('I was lucky enough to have as time and place of birth strangeness, exile, war, the ghost memory of peace, pain, mourning').11 Nor does she ever claim to be able to write as an Algerian: the book that she will never write is the story of the three Muslim girls admitted, after years of exclusion, to the Lycee (pp. 153-54). Algeria herself speaks to the nar- rator-as-child, as clearly as allegory or dream, and asks her what she is doing there: it is time for her to go; she will not be able to write Algeria or live in Algeria as long as it is disguised as "l'Algeriefran,aise." The writing of this book appears in this sense as founded on an essentially negative experience, reflected in the definition of space by exclusion: the narrator- as-child exists as if precariously on the margins of the different spaces of 198</page><page sequence="11">"l'AlgeriefranSaise": she is nowhere; she can only be on the outside look- ing in. A certain danger appear, in this narrowing of the space-from-which-to- write; yet the apparently negative quality of this writing from the margins, from the position of a third party, can be linked directly to the more overtly feminist writings of Cixous: "the experience of sexual difference is thus enlarged to other differences.""2 Part of Cixous's feminist project is, of course, the deconstruction of the frozen, cliched image of women inherited from millennia of masculine representation: as Violette Santellani says, "she speaks of the urgency of getting out of the representation, of breaking these genders that, by naming 'man' or 'woman,' keep every being in the shackles of an image, further reinforced by Law. ... One must become Neutral again. Neutral: that is, neither the one nor the other."13 Neither the one nor the other: just as a clear-sighted vision is available to the child looking in from the margins, so it must be possible to find a place from which to see over the binary divisions of this false (colonial) opposition. For Helene Cixous, evidently, this freedom (or marginality) of vision is maintained by constant slippage from one gender role to another, thanks here, in part, to her "hermaphroditic" semiunity with her brother, and from one place to another in the overdefined series of exclusions, of walls, doors, and gateways that is her childhood Algeria. A slippage that is first and foremost semantic: as Mireille Calle-Gruber puts this, "Helene Cixous does not lock up meaning, but leaves it/herself free to follow the luck of lin- guistic and textual crossroads.""4 The freedom of linguistic play (liberating or unlocking meaning) thus offsets the locked gates/doors that exclude the narrator-as-child from the various spaces of her childhood and releases her fiction from the narrowed space that threatened to imprison it in this piece of writing.
