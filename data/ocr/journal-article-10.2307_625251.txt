Introduction.-A Herbal is a collection of descriptions of plants put together for medical purposes. Most herbal remedies are quite devoid of any rational basis. It may be taken for granted that the writer of a herbal is unable to treat evidence on a scientific basis. He makes a ' direct attack' on disease, without any 'nonsense about theories.' The herbal is thus to be distinguished from the scientific botanical treatise by the fact that its aims are exclusively 'practical '-a vague and foolish word with which, from the days of Plato to our own, men have sought to conceal from themselves and from others their destitution of anything in the nature of general ideas. A herbal is, moreover, to be distinguished from most other medical works not only in method but also in form. Its arrangement is under remedies rather than under diseases or conditions to be treated. A herbal is, in fact, primarily a descriptive drug-list or, as we now call it, a pharmacopoeia.1 Pharmacopoeias include a number of substances that cannot be classed as of vegetable origin. Nevertheless, in many ancient as in most modern medical systems, there has been a tendency for remedies to be of a herbal nature. The pharmacopoeias of the Greco-Roman world thus tended to approximate to the nature of herbals. The herbal assumed a definite literary form during the fourth century B.C., and 1 In antiquity the word pharmacopoeia was used to describe a drug-compounder, not a drug-list. The English usage dates from the seventeenth century, and Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy (1621) is perhaps responsible for it. A modern pharmacopoeia describes only the drugs and their prepara- tion, without discussing their application. J.H.S.-VOL. XLVII. 1 B</page><page sequence="2">2 CHARLES SINGER this form, as we shall see, has persisted with comparatively little alteration throughout the ages. The earliest Greek writings which involve any extensive knowledge of plants had a medical end. In the group of works known as the Hippocratic Collection, the more important elements of which date from the fifth and fourth centuries B.c., many plant remedies are mentioned. From that group of works modern investigators have gleaned a list of between three and four hundred plants.2 It .is noteworthy that no contemporary ancient author thought of doing this. It is also noteworthy that Greek Art before the third century B.C. seldom exhibited interest in plants and hardly ever attempted to represent them naturalistically. In accord with this late advent of interest in plants is the fact that the first Greek herbal was put together within the lifetime of the generation that saw the opening of the Alexandrian period. ? 2. The Earliest Greek Herbals.-The first known author of a Greek herbal was Diokles of Karystos. He was practising medicine with enormous reputa- tion in Athens about 350 B.c., and is believed to have influenced the biological writings of Aristotle. He was, moreover, a pupil of the physician Philistion of Lokroi, and there is reason to think that this Philistion took part in certain botanical researches undertaken by the Academy. All accounts of these investigations are, however, lost, and the botanical treatise of Diokles himself has disappeared as completely as his other works. We know only that it was a systematic account, in which each of a series of short descriptions of plants and of their habitats was followed by a list of medical uses.3 A great collection of writings on plants bears the name of Theophrastus of Eresos (c. 372-287 B.c.), the pupil and successor of Aristotle. Most of this collection is of a highly scientific character, but some of it is interesting for our purpose as containing a mass of folk-lore and information concerning the herb- gatherers or rhizotomists. Even a superficial examination of these Theo- phrastan botanical writings shows that they are, at least in part, compilations. A good case has been made out for the view that some of the botanical materials in the Theophrastan writings have been drawn from the experiences of com- manders of Alexander's forces.4 The ninth book of the Theophrastan Historia plantarum is on a lower level than the rest, and is derived from writings of the nature of herbals. A recent investigator of the Theophrastan botanical collection makes the likely sugges- 2 On the plants mentioned in the Hippo- cratic Collection see R. von Grot, ' Ueber die in der hippokratischen Schriftsammlung enthaltenen pharmakologischen Kennt- nisse,' in R.

Of the ninth book, ?? ix-xii are most evidently extracted from a herbal. These sections give an idea of the character of the lost Alex4ndrian herbals upon which later herbals were based.6 ? 3. Herbals of the Alexandrian Period.--The Alexandrian period of medical development was fertile in works on plants. Herophilos (fl. c. 300 B.c.), most illustrious of Alexandrian physicians, was the author of such a treatise. If we may trust Pliny, it was less scientific than his other writings.7 Later Alex- andrian herbalists were Mantias (c. 270 B.c.),s Andreas of Karystos (c. 220 B.c.) 9 and Apollonios Mys (c. 200 B.c.).l0 Of these we know most of Andreas." He was physician to Ptolemy IV Philopater, and was murdered in the year 217 in mistake for him.12 Andreas wrote a work on herbs and their action, and named it Narthex. Several fragments have survived imbedded in the writings of later authors.l3 Galen derides him as a mountebank and quack,14 while Dioskurides, whom he deeply influenced, thought highly of him.15 After the fragments in the ninth book of the Historia plantarum of Theo- phrastus, the earliest surviving works of a herbal nature are the poems Theriaka and Alexipharmaka of Nikander, written about 200 B.C.16 These deal respec- tively with animal and with vegetable poisons and their supposed antidotes. In general form, as well as in irrationality, these poems are in the main line of herbal tradition. From an early date illustrated MSS. of Nikander were pre- pared. We gain some idea of them from a manuscript of the ninth century, the figures of which are copied from a classical source (Figs. 1 and 2). In the present state of this manuscript very few of the figures can be botanically diagnosed. With Nikander should be mentioned Philon of Tarsus, who probably lived at a slightly later date. He wrote a poem-parts of which have been preserved -which has a similar motive to Nikander, but is even more obscure.17 On a higher plane was the Roman physician and philosopher, Quintus Sextius Niger, for whom Seneca expresses admiration, as 'a man of acute philosophic insight, a master of Greek but a Roman in morals.' 18is He flourished about 25 B.c., 5 Lynn Thorndike, ' Disputed Dates, Civilisation and Climate, and Traces of Magic in the Scientific Treatises ascribed to Theophrastus,' in Essays on the History of Medicine presented to Karl Sudhof, edited by Charles Singer and Henry Sigerist, Ziurich, 1924. 1 The standard edition of the Theophras- tan botanical works is that of F.

This work is lost, but we have testimony as to its character, and that of its author, in a variety of ancient writings.19 ? 4. Krateuas and his Drawings of Plants. The Juliana Anicia Codex.-- At this point we turn to consider two men, one a monarch and the other his servant, who exercised great influence on the development of the herbal and helped to fix its form. Krateuas, the rhizotomist, was body physician to Mithridates VI Eupator (120-63 B.c.) of Pontus, who was himself a herbalist. Thus Pliny tells us that 'the plant skordion was described by this prince's own hand. He says that it is a cubit high, has a square stem, is many-branched and has hairy leaves similar [in form] to those of the oak. It is found in Pontus in rich humid soils and has a bitter taste.' 20 ' Among the other gifts with which this extraordinary man was endowed,' adds Pliny, 'was a peculiar devotion to medical inquiries. He gathered information from all his subjects . . . and it was his habit to take notes of their experience. These memoranda . . fell into the hands of Pompey . . . who at once commissioned his freedman, Lenaeus the grammarian, to translate them into Latin.' 21 The achievements of Mithridates as poisoner and as compounder of anti- dotes are too well known to be recounted here. The prescription for his panacea that was to protect him from all poisons has been preserved by Celsus (c. A.D. 30),22 and it may be hoped that his poisons were no more efficacious than his antidote. The name of Mithridates survived in a preparation well known to the drug-compounders of later times (p. 18). In the Middle Ages well-nigh every physician had his private mithridate, and the imposture was continued till the eighteenth century. Krateuas, the rhizotomist, the medical attendant of Mithridates, made a more creditable contribution to knowledge than did his master. He wrote a work on the nature and uses of herbs. His successor, Dioskurides,23 speaks of him with respect, as does the author of an early herbal work On the Centaury, which has come down to us falsely ascribed to Galen.24 There is, however, a better reason that entitles Krateuas to remembrance. In addition to this work he wrote a second herbal in which plants were not described but were depicted in figures. In the absence of technical terminology-a want shared by all departments of ancient science-this device was most valuable. The figures were followed by brief discussions of the medical uses of plants. Krateuas is thus the father of plant illustration. He has therefore exercised great influence not only on the subsequent development of the herbal,25 but also on the course of scientific botany. 19 These have been collected by M. Well- mann in his edition of Dioskurides, 3 vols., Berlin, 1914, III. p. 146. All references to Dioskurides are given to this standard edition, unless otherwise stated. 20 Pliny, XXV. ? 62. 21 Ibid., ? 3. 22 Celsus, De re medica, V. ? 23. 23 Dioskurides, II. ?? 6 and 7. 24 Pseudo-Galen, De virtute centaureae, ? 2. 25 On the place of Krateuas in the his- tory of plant-illustration see M.

The so-called Juliana Anicia Codex at Vienna is, in part, a text of Dioskurides, but contains much besides.

It is magnificently illustrated. The figures, many of which are admirably natural, are certainly copied from much earlier documents. It is clearly linked with the tradition of Krateuas, and on one page is a picture of that eminent rhizotomist, engaged in painting the forms of plants (Fig. 3).</page><page sequence="7">THE HERBAL IN ANTIQUITY 7 By his side stands the genius of Intelligence, Epinoia, holding a Mandrake. Beyond, a figure marked Dioskorides writes in a book. Important for our purpose is the fact that the Juliana Anicia codex con- tains accounts of the uses of eleven plants (Figs. 4-14), taken, as the scribe specifically states, from the text of Krateuas. We have thus, in any event, a considerable fragment of the work of Krateuas.26 Moreover, the passages are illustrated by figures of the plants, the virtues of which are discussed in the text. These illustrations, like the texts which accompany them, are presumably copied from the older Krateuas herbal. Now, at the date of the preparation of the Juliana Anicia codex, naturalistic drawing had long been a lost art. Some idea of the draughtsmanship of the period can be gleaned from Fig. 3. The Byzantine artist was utterly incapable of representing a living plant, save by slavishly copying an older drawing. All draughtsmanship of the fifth and sixth centuries goes to show that these natural- istic figures of the Juliana Anicia are not original. They are copied, and copied moreover from a very ancient source. The whole history of the Greek, as of the Latin, herbal is in accord with this view, which is further supported by much internal evidence yielded by the figures themselves. We find, too, that the figures in the Juliana Anicia codex are by more than one hand. They are of a varying degree of excellence, and those associated with the passages from Krateuas are among the very best. Others, however, are very stiff and formal, as is, for instance, the figure of Lochitis (Fig. 27). The style of the best of these drawings (Figs. 4-14) shows that they date back to originals which can hardly be later than the second century A.D. and may be much earlier. If, as there is no reason to doubt, they come ultimately from Krateuas himself, then we can obtain a glimpse of his work in something like its original form.27 ? 5. A Restoration of part of the Rhizotomikon of Krateuas.-Assuming that the drawings in Juliana Anicia resemble or are derived from those of Krateuas himself, we may consider the form of his illustrated herbal. At his date it would have been written on a scroll, but the general arrangement of the columns must have been similar to that of the pages of the papyrus herbal codex that we here figure and describe (? 10, p. 31, and Plates I and II). Each column contained a picture of a plant. Below this picture was written the name of the plant, followed by a short account of its medical uses. I endeavour to re-create an impression of the illustrated herbal of Krateuas, and for this purpose each herb is given a page to itself (p. 8-p. 17). There is evidence from both Greek and Latin herbals that originally this rule was generally followed. It may be convenient to have a translation of this early remnant of a prototype of the mediaeval and modern herbal. Some of the text is corrupt, and I have to thank Professor J. F. Dobson, of Bristol University, for help in rendering some of the more incomprehensible passages. Identifications of plants have been kindly provided by Mr. A. J. Wilmott of the Botanical 26 The passages from Krateuas can be consulted in the facsimile of the Juliana Anicia MS., but are conveniently reprinted in Wellmann's Dioskurides, III. p. 144. 27 Those drawings associated with passages ascribed to Krateuas are all by the same hand, and in the same style.</page><page sequence="8">8 CHARLES SINGER r ~Y( c, r \ J i r FIG. 4.--GREATER ARISTOLOCHIA (Ari8tolochia sempervirens, fol. 17 v.) 1 Drunk in wine and used as a plaster draws out (the poison of) reptiles and deadly beasts.

I have obtained the figures by a very careful tracing of the outlines of the plants in a facsimile of Juliana Anicia. I avoid all attempt to represent shading, hoping thus to get nearer the original form. The tracings have been reduced photographically from the original size by about half the diameter, except those of the Anagallides (figs. 13 and 14), which are about one quarter diameter. It may be noted that all plants are represented with their roots. This is the universal rule in manuscript herbals. ? 6. Greek Herbalists of the First Century A.D.-From the time of Krateuas there has been no lack of contributions to the development or, more accurately, to the extension of the herbal. In the first century of the Christian era appeared a number of works which had their influence in shaping the herbals of the Middle Ages. The earliest of these first-century herbals was, perhaps, that of Pamphilos, a Greek physician who practised in Rome. He wrote a work on plants which, for the first time, was arranged in alphabetical order, a device subsequently often adopted. If Galen be just in his criticisms,34 the work of Pamphilos resembled later herbals in other respects, for he tells us that the author described plants which he had evidently never seen, and that he mingled much absurd and superstitious matter with his imperfect descriptions.35 Parts of this work of Pamphilos are contained in the Juliana Anicia MS. At about the time of Pamphilos there flourished Menecrates, physician to the Emperor Tiberius (A.D. 14-37). He wrote a treatise on drugs which included a preparation of which medical men speak to this day. It is known as Diachylon plaster, and its preparation is described by Galen.36 The work of Menecrates is lost, but a Diachylon plaster has survived in modern medicine. The name has come down to us continuously through the Middle Ages, the composition being repeatedly altered. In our time it is the name alone that survives, for whereas the ancient Diachylon was compounded of juices of plants, the modern Diachylon is a preparation of lead. Andromachos of Crete, physician to Nero (A.D. 54-68), was the first to bear the title Archiater.36" We have descriptions of a considerable number of preparations under his name."3 He was the author of three works on remedies. His great title to fame, or at least to notoriety, is, however, his modification of the mithridate (p. 5) or panacea. This became in his hands an enormously complicated mixture to be used against all manner of poison, injury or disease. Up to the end of the eighteenth century it was the custom in certain continental cities to prepare once a year, in public and in the presence of the magistrates, a Theriaca Andromachi.38 The word Theriac in this connexion has given rise to 34 Galen, K. VI. p. 792 seq., XII. p. 31. 35 For Pamphilos see M. Wellmann, Hermes, LI. p. 1. 36 Galen, K. XIII. p. 996. See also K. XII. pp. 846 and 946. 36a On the Archiaters see R.

An eighteenth-century theriac had about 140 ingredients. These are the ways of herbal progress ! About the same time as Andromachos there lived the physician Servilius Damocrates, of whom Galen thought highly.41 Of the works of Damocrates some pages have survived.42 They include what is evidently a fragment of a herbal,43 in which we have descriptions of the habits and uses of the plant iberis and of the poppy. From the work on medicaments by Servilius Damo- crates, Galen borrowed freely.44 ? 7. Dioskurides.-All previous herbal writers fade into insignificance before Pedanios Dioskurides of Anazarba. He has stamped himself even on modern botanical nomenclature. Dioskurides, after having studied 'at Alexandria and Tarsus, became attached as physician to the Roman army in Asia soon after the middle of the first Christian century. He tells us, in the preface to his great work, that he had visited many countries and that from his youth he was given to investigating plants. While not as credulous as many herbal writers, he yet exhibits no critical powers and little genuine scientific interest or capacity. His main interest, as with all herbalists, is a ' practical' one, and his descriptions of the plants are very brief when compared with the space that he gives to their application. It is possible that these descriptions have been abbreviated, in places at least, in the text that has come down to us. There is a minor work, 17Ept ' irAov &lt;bapdKCOwv, that bears the name of Dioskurides.45 The only work that is certainly by him, however, is his IHEp' viAg? larptK7g, usually known as De materia medica. The Greek title, as we have seen, had already been used by Sextius Niger (c. 20 B.c., p. 3) for a similar composition. Dioskurides assures us that his own work differs from its predecessors in being arranged on a definite system. Nevertheless, his scheme does not contain any clear mode of classification. MDCCXLIV.'

OF DIOSKURIDES. The black circles signify existing manuscripts.</page><page sequence="21">THE HERBAL IN ANTIQUITY 21 The herbal of Dioskurides is divided up into short sections or chapters, each of which usually discusses a single drug. In the case of those sections which deal with plants, the name is given first, followed by the Greek synonym, or, in a few cases, by the Latin synonym in Greek letters. Then comes a short description of the plant, followed by a reference to its place of origin or habitat. Lastly, the mode of preparation of the drug and its uses in medicine are detailed. In many cases the descriptions of Dioskurides are adequate for the diagnosis of the plant, but in others the plants are quite unrecognisable. It is, however, to be remembered that the task of identifying the Dioskuridean plants need not be quite abandoned until there has been a full scientific exploration of the flora of Asia Minor.46 The botanist de Tournefort (1656-1708), during his journey in that region, was able to identify a great number of the plants of Dios- kurides.47 Many also were identified by John Sibthorp (1758-96), who travelled extensively in the Eastern Mediterranean and had personally examined the Juliana Anicia Codex.48 No definite system of classification is adopted by Dioskurides, but occasionally he groups plants according to their outward habit, so that various members of such groups as, for instance, Labiatae, Papillionaceae, Umbelliferae and Compositae fall .together. This method does not avoid extraordinary misunderstandings. Thus we find Delphinium among the Ranunculaceae and the Composite Anthemis Pyrethrum with the Umbelliferae. A certain amount of grouping is determined by the properties or supposed properties of the plants under consideration. Thus in Book III we encounter together a number of plants that are sour or that are supposed to be aphrodisiac. Dioskurides writes provincial Greek and is not fully conversant with the literary language. He is conscious of this defect, for in the preface of the book he begs Areios, to whom it is dedicated, 'to consider not his expository power but the experience and care involved.' The book of Dioskurides reveals a long lineage of works similar to itself. It is evident that its author leans heavily on Sextius Niger and Krateuas. From Iollas of Bithynia, Andreas, Herakleides of Tarentum, Julius Bassus the Asclepiad and a number of others, he has taken particular points. He quotes too from works bearing the better known names of Hippocrates, Theophrastus, Erasistratos and Nikander, not neglecting Juba, the learned king of Numidia, of whose herbal achievements we hear from Pliny. Dioskurides mentions about five hundred plants. Of these about one hundred and thirty are in the Hippocratic Collection.49 Many of these drugs had, therefore, been in use in the Greek world for at least four centuries before Dioskurides wrote. But if the Dioskuridean herbs can be traced backward they can also be followed forward. A considerable number of items of the Dioskuri- 46 The most satisfactory identifications of the Dioskuridean flora will be found in J.

Lindley, between 1806 and 1840. 49 R. Mock, Pflanzliche Arzneimittel bei Dioskurides die schon in Corpus Hippo- craticumn vorkommen, Inaug.

Of these forty-four items only about a quarter have any definite pharmacological action. The remainder are diluents, flavouring agents, emollients and the like. ? 8. The Greek MSS. of Dioskurides (Fig. 15).-The number of Greek MSS. of Dioskurides is very large and their relationship is extremely complicated.51 Some light has recently been shed by the study of a papyrus fragment of the second century known as the Michigan papyrus.52 Here I discuss only a few of the more important lines of descent. Of the relationship even of these, I can attempt only the merest sketch. The work of Dioskurides appeared about the middle of the first century A.D. By the end of the second century, at least two recensions of the original text were available. Of one of these recensions, Pf, we have an almost con- temporary fragment in the papyrus at Michigan. Only one other descendant of this recension (Escorial III. R. 3) seems to have survived. This descendant is, therefore, of some importance for fixing the text.53 All other known manuscripts are derived from the other recension, a. Before the end of the third century, and perhaps before the end of the second, the main Recension which we designate a became associated with a number of synonyms of plant names, and with the figures of at least two illustrated herbals, one of which was that of Krateuas. The resultant is the source of the remaining MSS. From some of these MSS., however, the synonyms or figures or both, have been more or less completely omitted. Many of the manuscripts, moreover, have become contaminated, to a greater or less degree, with other material. These modifications are in addition to ordinary scribal accidents. Thus, the restoration of the original text of Diosku- rides has been excessively laborious, and has demanded the highest critical skill. The task has been accomplished by Professor Wellmann of Berlin. 50 R. Schmidt, Die noch gebrdiuchlichen Arzneimittel bei Dioskurides, Inaug. Diss., Tiubingen, 1919. 51 The study of the MSS. of Dioskurides is chiefly the work of M. Wellmann, who has devoted an immense amount of labour to the subject. Wellmann's conclusions will be found in the article in Pauly-Wis- sowa's Realencyclopdidie, Vol. V., Stuttgart, 1905, and in the preface to Vol. II. of his text of Dioskurides, Berlin, 1906-7. Much information can be obtained from H. Diels, Die Handschriften der antiken Arzte, II., Berlin, 1906. Some results are summarised by Charles Singer, Studies in the History and Method of Science, II. p. 64, Oxford, 1921. 52 C.

He has greatly coarsened and simplified the Juliana Anicia figures. Some of the changes result from crowding several figures-usually three-on a page, a method he adopts throughout.

FEPANION ETEPON (Geranium molle),</page><page sequence="24">24 CHARLES SINGER The synonyms associated with the text of Dioskurides are perhaps derived from the Alexandrian lexicographer, Pamphilos, of the first century A.D., who is not to be confused with the contemporary botanist, the Roman physician of the same name (p. 18). Many of the synonyms are drawn from very unusual sources and even from languages of which we now know nothing. Their further study may well yield interesting philological results.54 The titles include: African,' Andreae medici,' Armenian, ' Bessicum,' Boeotian, Cappado- cian, Dacian, ' Dardana,' ' Democriti,' Egyptian, Ethiopian, Gaulish, Spanish, 'Istrici,' ' Lucanica,' ' Marsum,' Osthanis, 'Prophetae,' Pythagoreans, Romans ('Pwpa-oL), Tuscans, and Zoroastrians. It is an index of the static character of mediaeval thought that these synonyms were copied and recopied in both Latin and Greek herbals, right on to the sixteenth century, when the languages from which they were drawn had been extinct for more than a thousand years.55 A further discussion of the uses of these synonyms will be found on p. 33. Besides the synonyms and the figures from the herbals that passed into Recension a, parts of the text of Krateuas and of another illustrated herbal passed into a descendant of that recension. This version was then alpha- betically rearranged, and may be designated Dioscorides alphabeticus (see Fig. 15). From this rearrangement Oribasios (325-403), physician to the Emperor Julian, writing about the year 400, made excerpts for his great compilation, the 'IarpucKal Zvvaywayal. Moreover, the alphabetical recension acquired other accretions with which we are not here concerned. It was from such composite sources that the Juliana Anicia was derived.56 To the class derived from the alphabetical rearrangement of the fourth century belong the earliest and most beautiful of the manuscripts of Dios- kurides. First of these is the Juliana Anicia, written in capitals. Next in beauty and age is a half-uncial MS. of the seventh century, the Neapolitanus, now in St. Mark's Library at Venice.57 Many of the figures in the Neapolitanus are good and naturalistic. At first sight one might conclude that they were the work of some gifted artist of the seventh century, born out of his time and maintaining something of the classical vigour. A com- parison of his figures with those of the Juliana Anicia at once dispels this vision and reveals the manner of work of the artist. The figures of the Neapolitanus are nothing but simplified, coarsened and sometimes mis- understood versions of those of the Juliana Anicia. They exhibit no attempt to appeal to nature (See Fig. 16, and compare with Figs. 17 and 18). The figures of the Juliana Anicia MS. were themselves often copied, especially at the Revival of Learning.58 Apart from direct copies, there was 54 A bibliography of some of the writings on them is given in J. de Karabagek, De codicis Dioscuridei Aniciae Julianae, Ley- den, 1906, p. 83. 55 Some of these names are discussed by M. Wellmann in Hermes, XXXIII. p. 369, Berlin, 1898. 56 Charles Singer, Studies in the History and Method of Science, II. p. 63, Oxford, 1921, for a description of the various sources of Juliana Anicia. 51 A facsimile page of this Neapolitanus will be found in the New Palaeographical Society, II., Plate 45. 58 There is a good fifteenth-century copy of Juliana Anicia in the University Library at Cambridge, Ee 5.

The MSS. in this group stand apart from all others. There is another class of alphabetical text in which the original division into five books is preserved, but in which the material is arranged in alphabetical order within each of the five books. This arrangement was probably not made before the ninth century (see Fig. 15).

It seems likely that the parent MS. of this group was near relation to the hypothetical document Q of Wellmann. Q was the ancestor of certain much-studied, later, non-alphabetic MSS.

The figures themselves are for the most part naturalistically drawn, though none are original or from the object. The MS. is in a poor state, so that most of the figures are greatly deteriorated. Some, e.g. that of the Croton oil plant (Figs. 24 and 25), are in the full tradition of the primary alphabetic group. Others are very far removed from that tradition. Of these latter we may specially refer to two, the mandrake and the ' lochitis.' There are three figures of mandrakes in Paris 2179, but none is given human attributes. I do not know any other non-anthropomorphic mediaeval repre- sentation of mandrakes. Unfortunately, we cannot compare the mandrakes FIG. 24.-JULIANA ANICIA, FO. 170 v.

CROTON OIL PLANT. of Paris 2179 with that of the Juliana Anicia, because the original section on the mandrake is missing from the Juliana Anicia, though the plant is represented elsewhere in that volume (Fig. 3). There is, however, an anthro- pomorphic mandrake in its proper place in the series in Anicia's relative, the closely allied Neapolitanus. Moreover, there is an anthropomorphic mandrake closely similar to that of the Neapolitanus in the Pierpont Morgan Codex (Fig. 35), which is a distant cousin to Paris 2179. On these and on other grounds we may make two inferences:- (a) The figures of Paris 2179 contain traditions different from those of any known MS. (b) These traditions are very early, dating back to the period of naturalistic</page><page sequence="29">THE HERBAL IN ANTIQUITY 29 draughtsmanship, i.e. not later than the second or third century A.D., and probably earlier. Some of its sources differ from those of Juliana Anicia. But though Paris 2179 does not render the mandrake anthropomorphically, this must not be attributed to wisdom on the part of the ninth-century artist who illustrated it. Elsewhere, copying doubtless from yet another ancient source, he falls readily enough. Thus, for instance, his AoXt-sg, which does not resemble that of Juliana Anicia, is fully anthropomorphic (Figs. 26 and 27). Paris 2179 is partly illegible, but can be supplemented from a copy of the eleventh century made at Venice. Other MSS. of the same class but of later date are at Florence, the Vatican and Vienna. There are also very numerous interpolated and inferior MSS. derived from the same tradition. These extend to the seventeenth century and beyond, but need not detain us.

It consists of eleven books, of which the first eight were prepared before A.D. 180. Books I and II are concerned with various points in the composition of medicines and are thus important for the development of pharmacy rather than of the herbal. Books III-V contain a statement of a very peculiar pharmacological theory which had great effect on the development of mediaeval medicine, but which does not concern us here. Books VI-VIII contain a list of drugs and their uses arranged in alphabetical order according to the names of the drugs. This is the earliest alphabetical herbal that has survived.

The alphabetical herbal of Galen is divided into paragraphs, most of which correspond to a single plant. The paragraphs open with the name of the plant, sometimes with synonyms added. Galen then usually mentions the locality from which the plant comes and its difference from or likeness to allied plants. More seldom he gives a description of the plant. He closes by dealing with its medical application. The second century of the Christian era saw with Galen the termination of the creative period of Greek science and the silting up of the channels by which the human mind could be refreshed by new knowledge. Oribasios (325-403), whose works became most popular in the Dark Ages, borrowed freely from Galen, On Simples, as he did from Dioskurides, De materia medica, for his Synagoge and his Euporista. The Simples of Galen, like the Materia medica of Dioskurides and the Synagoge and Euporista of Oribasios, were early translated into Latin. But even the herbal works of Dioskurides, Galen and Oribasios were too difficult for the wilting mind of the Dark Ages. They had serious competitors in yet shorter and easier works. Such simple herbals had been in existence as far back as the days of Theophrastus, but with the decay of the Western intellect they came to be used even by professional physicians, among whom they tended to displace treatises demanding a slightly greater mental effort. Among these feeble works for feeble minds were herbals which resembled that of Krateuas, in giving only the name of the plant accompanied by a picture and a very brief account of its uses. Papyrus fragments of two Greek forms of such documents have come down to us. One is of the second or third century of the Christian era. It describes several plants, of which the name of only one, pseudo-dictamon, can be distinguished. It is but a tiny fragment, but we can see enough to say that its illustrations were of the most formal and diagrammatic character.60 Of the other, of the fourth-fifth century of the Christian era, we now proceed to give an account. We would distinguish it by designating it the Johnson papyrus. ? 10. The Johnson Papyrus (Plates I and II).-This papyrus fragment was found by Mr. J. de M. Johnson in 1904, while working at Antinoe for the Egypt Exploration Fund, now the Egypt Exploration Society. I have to thank Mr. Johnson for drawing my attention to it and for obtaining permission to describe it. All the fragments found with it were of about the end of the fourth or the beginning of the fifth century A.D. Such a date as A.D. 400 would accord well with the script on our fragment. The extreme length of the papyrus is 22-7 millimetres and the extreme breadth 11-1 millimetres, from which it will be seen that our coloured figures are slightly reduced. The fragment was a page in a codex, and there is evidence that its full size was about 25 by 16 millimetres. It is in a fair state of preservation. The colours of the paintings are clearly discernible, and are 60 J. de M.

The special interest of this papyrus lies in the relationship, both of its text and figures, to the Latin work known as the Herbarium Apulei. On the recto is a cabbage-like plant with heavy leaves of bluish-grey closely applied to each other. It bears the title CYMOYTON. There is no figure of Symphyton in the Juliana Anicia MS., but our figure accords well with the Sinfitos of the Leyden Apuleius (Fig. 28) of the seventh century and better with that of the Cassel Apuleius of the ninth century (Fig. 29). Both these MSS. we shall presently discuss (p. 43). Below the cabbage-like plant, in the papyrus, roots can be seen. Underneath I have been able to read a few words, which Mr. H. I. Bell of the British Museum has kindly checked and amplified as follows :- CYM([YTON] [ AYTH H BOTANH TP[I]BOM[ENH eEPATTEYEI TTACAN[ KAI TPAYMATA K[AI KOIAC KOAA[ TAC OEPATTEY[EI 1 line defaced [ [. ..] TTEP[ On the verso is a plant with a brown bulbous base from which four or five shoots go upwards, and a number of roots downwards. The shoots bear greenish-yellow leaves and bluish-brown bulbs. Not much of the text for this plant can be read in the papyrus, but Mr. Bell and I have been able to distinguish the words:- 4AOMMHOC TON XYAON [. . .]MO.YXON KAI MYEAOC AA KAI KOPON KAI/ ON OPO TOY B.AA fN KAI TT OEPA]I-EYEI Y Thus, two parts of the plant Phlommos, namely, the juice (XYAON) and the pith (MYEAOS), were used. There is not the slightest resemblance between the Q-AOMMOS of our papyrus and the figures of AOMMOS exhibited in the Juliana Anicia MS. The figure accords fairly well, however, with the Verbascum seu EFlogmon of the Leyden Apuleius of the seventh century (Fig. 30), allowing for the usual misinterpretations of the illustrators of MSS. of this type.</page><page sequence="33">THE HERBAL IN ANTIQUITY 33 It may be asked why the two plants CYMiYTON (Sinfitos) and QAOMMOO (Verbascum) are to be found on consecutive pages of the papyrus ? Is the sequence or association encountered elsewhere ? Now, in discussing the illustrated MS. herbals, it cannot be too strongly emphasised that they are merely literary products. During the period under consideration their preparation implied and involved no real knowledge of the plants. In many cases, as in those of the papyrus herbal, the plant is quite unrecognisable, even by a modern botanist. It may be assumed that any plant that bore a general resemblance to the picture would serve the herbalist's turn. But, while neglecting the study of nature, the manufacturers of these herbals stressed greatly the names of the plants, as is shown by the constant recurrence of the synonyms. In this they showed their knowledge of their market. The users of these documents in later ages often glossed the pictures in the vernacular, for the synonyms had then become meaningless. At an earlier date the synonym lists served the purpose of glosses. Even in modern England, the same plant is frequently called by different names and different plants by the same name, in different parts of the country. How much more would this be so in the vast and polyglot Roman Empire, with no scientific botanists to preserve a standard. As regards names of plants in antiquity, we have thus, very often, to deal only with words which have no botanical facts behind them. Now it happens that there is manuscript authority for the association of the names CYMOYTON and qAOMMOC. In the text of Dioskurides (I. 28) we learn that the plant 'EAEVtov has both Symplyton and Flomos as synonyms : d&amp; u8 i idvrov ..... ... 8. ..o 4dov 'I38aCOv KCXo(TLV : and then, in the next paragraph (I. 29), we learn that Krateuas himself had described a variety of this plant from Egypt: 'EAEvtov \Ao tCnEopEt KpaCTEECLS yEvvcraltEL 'v 'AtyV`T7. The association of the two plant names iAOMMOC and CYMiYTON is therefore in the Greek tradition. From our examination of this fragment of papyrus, we have inferred that it is from a Greek work similar in form, substance and illustration to the Latin Apuleius, which was among the most widespread of Latin medical documents during the Dark Ages. We have only a single folio of the papyrus, but both text and figures on each side are of a type, compass and arrangement familiar in Latin dress. To the Latin herbals we therefore turn. ? 11. Earlier Latin Herbals.-The Latin herbals that were passed on to the Middle Ages were of Greek origin. The Greek herbals, however, did not find the Latin field altogether unoccupied. Thus, Cato the Censor had a book of remedies in his possession, by the help of which he treated the maladies of his son, his servants and his friends.61 Extracts from that book are to be found in his De re rustica. It contained many simple herbal remedies interspersed with charms and spells. The herbals, however, that came to hold the day among the Latins contain relatively few magical elements. 61 Pliny, XIX. ? 8. J.H.S.-VOL. XLVII. D</page><page sequence="34">34 CHARLES SINGER More dependent on Greek sources than Cato is the vast compilation of Pliny, of which Books XX-XXV form, in fact, a herbal. The main part of Pliny's herbal is made up of short paragraphs which tell us of the nature and uses of plants, much in the manner of Dioskurides. Pliny and Dioskurides were almost contemporary, but neither refers to the other, though they often overlap or supplement each other. Pliny is less systematic and more credulous than Dioskurides, and his remedies, while no more effective, are certainly, on the whole, more disgusting. Much of Pliny's herbal is derived from Theophrastus or from the same sources as Theophrastus.62 In the period immediately following Pliny we hear little of Latin herbals, though we have a number of medical compositions of equally low grade. Such are the poem of Quintus Serenus Sammonicus (third century) and the work ascribed to Gargilius Martialis (died 360). More directly in the line of the herbal is the De virtutibus pigmentorum vel herbarum aromaticarum of Theodorus Priscianus, physician to the Emperor Gratian (375-83).63 This is of the nature of an exceedingly simple alphabetical herbal which is natural fellow to the more popular work bearing the name of Apuleius (see p. 37). Priscianus borrows from the herbal of Galen (p. 29). In the fifth or sixth century, Galen On Simples, as well as Dioskurides De materia medica, were translated into Latin. They had much influence on the late mediaeval herbals, which also absorbed material from the imbecile and filthy works to which are attached the names of Marcellus Empiricus Burdi- galiensis and Sextus Empiricus Papyriensis, both probably of the fifth century. Little later than these is the translation into Latin of the Greek text of Dioskurides, to which our story now leads us. ? 12. The Latin Dioscorides (Fig. 15).-In the sixth century, two versions or translations of Dioskurides from Greek into Latin were made in Italy. Of these two versions one is usually designated Dioscorides Lombardus. It is well represented by a South Italian MS. of the ninth century, in the Beneventan script sometimes misleadingly called Lombardic, now at Munich.64 This remarkable manuscript still preserves the numbering of the chapters in Greek letters, but has dropped the lists of synonyms. It has a very peculiar set of figures that have no relation to the Krateuan line. The origin of these figures in the Munich MS. is not, as yet, apparent. The other version we may designate Dioscorides vulgaris. Of it, or of some similar version, we have an almost contemporary specimen in a Vienna palim- psest of about 600.65 It was perhaps Dioscorides vulgaris that was known to Cassiodorus (490-585), who recommended illustrated copies of it to such of his monks in the Vivarium at Squillace as were unable to read Greek.66 It had 62 J.

Of this main Latin tradition there are scores of MSS.,67 many of them combined or mixed with the Herbarium Apulei Platonici (see p. 37). Yet others are combined or mixed with the so-called Dioscoridis de Herbis Femininis (p. 47). Moreover, the descent of the figures in the MSS. of Dioscorides vulgaris is not always identical with that of the texts. Since the number of the MSS. is immense, and since they are scattered all over Europe, their relationships cannot yet be described. Our account is tentative and deals only with one or two interesting lines. Among the earlier MS8. of the combination of the Herbarium Apulei with Dioscorides vulgaris are two Paris MSS. of the ninth century, which bear traces of South Italian derivation (12995 and 9332). From a version not very distant from these was prepared, again in South Italy, a Turin MS. of the eleventh century (Turin K IV 3) in Beneventan script.68 A sister MS. in another script has Anglo-Saxon glosses (Harley 5294). A copy of a version in Anglo-Saxon with many interpolations, and adorned with superb illustrations, partly destroyed by fire (Cotton Vitellius C III),69 belongs also to the South Italian tradition.70 The Mediterranean original of the Anglo-Saxon illus- trations obtrudes itself in many places. Thus the representation of a scorpion (Plate III) is good and naturalistic. Again, the figures of such common plants as the henbane and mugwort (Plate IV) are of southern and not of English specieg, though the native forms were important in Anglo-Saxon magic. Even more significant is it that the figures of the first printed herbal-issued at Rome about the year 1481-are nearer the Anglo-Saxon figures than those of any surviving MS. The cause of this becomes clear when we find that the Roman herbal was itself printed from a Montecassino original (see ? 13, p. 39, and Figs. 36 and 37). The contemporary figures closest to the Anglo-Saxon are in a Paris MS. (Lat. 6862), which also has southern affiliations (Figs. 31 and 32, and compare Plates III and IV), though its position in the line of descent is not yet clear to me. Among the numerous manuscripts of Dioscorides vulgaris are two sister MSS. written in Germany late in the twelfth century. One is in the British Museum (Harley 4986) and the other is at Eton College. Both are combined with Apuleius, and the latter contains a frontispiece in which rhizotomists are represented at work (Plate V).71 On the -left two bearded rhizotomists dig up plants under the direction of a youth, who is, perhaps, meant for Aesculapius. They use special instruments designed to avoid injuring the roots. On the right f7 The list given by H.

The draughtsmanship of this representation preserves some memories of the classical tradition of the well-known early MSS. of Terence.72 Both these MSS. exhibit signs of the passage of their drawings of plants into formal shapes which lead on to the distinctive Anglo-Norman type (see p. 43), and both exhibit many theriomorphic forms (Plate VI). During the Middle Ages Dioscorides was widely read by the Latins, and parts were naturally absorbed into other writings. This was the case with the.work known as Dioscoridis de herbis femininis, with which I deal later (? 15, p. 47). Partly derived from the Latin Dioscorides is also the famous herbal in verse bearing the name 'Macer Floridus,' composed in 1161 by Odo of Meune. Another well-known herbal of the twelfth century going back to the same source is the so-called Circa Instans of Matthaeus Platearius of Naples. In the following century there is evidence that Simon Cordo of Genoa drew on Dioscorides Lombardus, relying on the present MS. Munich 337 (p. 34) for his very popular dictionary of simples.7" Some of the great scholastic encyclopaedists, such as Bartholomew the Englishman (c. 1260) and Vincent of Beauvais (c. 1190-c. 1264), similarly depended on the Latin translations of Dioscorides. At the advent of printing, the old Dioscorides vulgaris was still being studied. It appeared in print in 147873a and again in 1512. Aldus Manutius produced the editio princeps of the Greek text in 1499, and this formed the basis of the very numerous editions and translations of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Of these the most important was that of Pietro Andrea Mattioli (1501-77), which was first published at Venice in 1554, ran through a vast number of editions in many languages, and is a basic work of modern botany. ? 13. The Herbal of Apuleius (Fig. 33).-The most widely-read of the late classical medical works, and that most frequently encountered in the Latin MSS. of the Dark Ages, bears the title Herbarium Apulei Platonici Madaurensis. There is internal evidence that it was adapted or translated from the Greek. There is now external evidence also, for its form closely resembles the Johnson Papyrus (? 14, p. 43). The Herbarium of Apuleius was illustrated from an early date and perhaps from the first. The figures of the earliest MSS. resemble those of the Johnson Papyrus. How the name of Apuleius came to be attached to it we do not know. It is certainly not by the author of the Golden Ass. In investigating the relationship of the MSS. of the herbal of Apuleius, I have had much help from Professor Sudhoff of Leipzig, who has generously given me many photographs. Lately Professors Ernest Howald of ZUirich and Henry Sigerist of Ziirich and Leipzig have undertaken an edition of the text of the Herbarium of Apuleius. Professor Sigerist has kindly forwarded me proofs of the Preface and relevant pages of this edition. These have cleared my ideas 72 Vatican, Lat. 3868, and Paris, Lat. 7859, both of about A.D. 900.

The Greek original is now lost, but must have closely resembled the Johnson Papyrus. Soon after, or perhaps at the time of translation, the herbal of Apuleius was combined with a list of synonyms</page><page sequence="39">THE HERBAL IN ANTIQUITY 39 similar to that of Dioskurides. By the sixth century the original recension had divided into three archetypes distinguished by Howald and Sigerist as a, 9 and y (Fig. 33). Howald and Sigerist find that Class a yields the best text. It contains, however, neither the most ancient nor the most beautiful MSS. Fragments of this class are known of the seventh and eighth centuries. Of the ninth century we have two south Italian copies, one at Montecassino and another at Lucca. The Lucca MS. is of interest because its figures show some affinity to those of the Apuleian section of the great Anglo-Saxon codex (Cotton Vitellius C III). The Anglo-Saxon codex and its Lucca cousin are both gravely injured by fire. We have already drawn attention to the relationship of the Anglo-Saxon codex and Paris 6862 (p. 35). We may pursue the story of the Anglo-Saxon version of Apuleius a little further. The Anglo-Saxon Apuleius is combined with an Anglo-Saxon version of the Latin Dioscorides. There is little doubt in my mind that both works were rendered into Anglo-Saxon at the same time and both from a South Italian original. As late as the fifteenth century, there existed at Monte- cassino a Latin MS. of Apuleius, the figures of which were very like those of the Anglo-Saxon version. This Montecassino MS. is now lost, but it was copied twice over, towards the end of the fifteenth century, and both copies are in the British Museum (Additional 17063 and Additional 21115). In both copies the figures are carefully drawn, and their close resemblance shows that the copying was faithful. A third sister of these two MSS. was the original of the editio princeps of the Apuleius herbal printed by Philip de Lignamine, which appeared at Rome about 1481. Thus it has come about that a work printed at Rome in the fifteenth century has figures which render it the nearest existing relative of an Anglo-Saxon MS. of the eleventh century (compare Figs. 34-37). Archetype f is parent of the most numerous class. Textually this class is the most unsatisfactory. On the other hand, it contains the most gorgeously illuminated copies. Moreover, it is in this class that we find the earliest return to naturalism. Archetype P splits up very early into a number of lines, of which we shall follow only a few. Of one line of P we have examples of the ninth century, with very crude drawings, of which the 'Hertensis' is a good specimen 74 (Figs. 38, 39). A somewhat isolated derivative of Archetype P is a Florentine MS. of the ninth century (Laur. Plut. 73. 41). The figures of this specimen are interesting to us as having preserved, better than most, a degree of resemblance to the line of Archetype y (compare Figs. 41 and 40). Being thus of a primitive and undifferentiated type, we are not surprised that the figures of this MS. retain also some resemblance to those of the Greek tradition (Figs. 42, 43). The line of Archetype f comes quite literally to flower at the beginning of the twelfth century, with a wonderful Oxford MS., Bodley 130, written at 74 Described by K.

The possibilities seem to be three. It might be that the naturalistic pictures of plants have been added to the manuscript at a much later date. Or it might be that these figures represent a school of art, other specimens of which have not yet come to light. Or, thirdly, it might be that they are the work of a plant-painter centuries ahead of his time. An examination of Bodley 130 shows that the figures were drawn first and the text afterwards written around them. In a few cases the opposite order was followed.

MANDRAKE. the first hypothesis can be dismissed.76 The second hypothesis is also untenable, since some of the drawings are traditional (Plate VII, Fig. b), and can be traced in the known series. We thus accept the third hypothesis. Some monastic lover of plants at Bury St. Edmunds, early in the twelfth century, had set himself the task of preparing a herbal. He made good but rough naturalistic drawings, referring at times to the actual plants themselves. We can reconstruct his method. He had before him a herbal of the usual Apuleius-Dioscorides type. He began by identifying figures in his MS. with plants in the monastery garden. These he painted. Thus, for 'Viperina' (Plate VIII, Fig. b) he adopted the milk thistle Carduus Marianus, then a garden plant from Southern Europe, where it is common in waste places, and now a weed of escape in Britain. Similarly, for 'Camedrum' of the ancient herbal he took Teucrium Chamaedrys (Plate VIII, Fig. c), another South European 76 I am glad to have this view confirmed in a private letter from Dr. M. R. James.</page><page sequence="43">THE HERBAL IN ANTIQUITY 43 and West Asiatic form which, though now established in parts of this country, is unquestionably a garden escape. For 'Dracontia' he drew the southern Dracunculus vulgaris (Plate VII, Fig. a) and for Paeonia a non-British Orobus (Plate VIII, Fig. a). In general he preferred garden plants to wild forms. He depicted the plants as he found them, with little regard to the order of the MS. from which he took his text. Finally, being unable to identify some of the figures in his original, he copied them. This he did, for instance, with ' Solago minor' (Plate VII, Fig. b), linking, however, the wrong figure with the text. He did not finish his collection, but went on with the animals from the associated Sextus Placitus text. Of some of these he gives lively and vigorous figures in the Anglo-Saxon style (Plate VII, Figs. c and d) of the period. Unfortunately that style perished and naturalism in Art had to await the Renaissance. A very vigorous and numerous branch of Archetype P is that which culminates in a group of splendidly illustrated manuscripts of Anglo-Norman workmanship, prepared at about the period when the twelfth century was passing into the thirteenth. In these the drawing is for the most part stiff and conventional, but the decoration is gorgeous. In technical execution they have no rival among herbal MSS. Of this group we place in the front rank an Oxford MS. (Ashmole 1462, Plate IX), and only a little behind it two others in the British Museum (Sloane 1975, Plate X, and Harley 1585). There are very numerous other descendants of Archetype P. A group written in Germany presents features similar to those of the Anglo-Norman MSS., and to it we have already referred in discussing the Latin MSS. of Dioscorides (p. 35). Another descendant of Archetype f is a thirteenth-century MS. at Vienna (93). It not only contains figures of plants but also very entertaining scenes illustrating the administration of drugs.77 The descendants of Archetype y present two matters of interest. The group contains the oldest MS., and their figures are nearest to those of our papyrus herbal. Of this class we need discuss only the Leyden (Voss Q. 9) of the seventh and the Cassel MS. of the tenth century. These are further dis- cussed in ? 14. The Leyden Apuleius is a fine half-uncial MS. of unknown provenance.78 There are, however, certain spellings in it which I have observed elsewhere in Beneventan medical MSS. I therefore suspect that it, too, is of South Italian origin. The Cassel MS. is a near relation of the Leyden MS. It comes from the Rhineland, and was long at Fulda, where it may have been written. ? 14. The Leyden and Cassel Apuleius MSS. and the Johnson Papyrus compared.-The two plants represented in the papyrus herbal can both be identified in the Leyden Apuleius. In the Leyden Apuleius is figured a plant bearing the title SINFITOS and consisting, like the CYMPYTON of our papyrus, of five broad leaves 1 Described and figured by K. Sudhoff, Archiv fiir Ge8chichte der Medizin, X. 105, Leipzig, 1916. 78 L. Traube, in his Die lateinischen Handschriften in alter Capitalis und in Unciali8, does not give any locality for this MS.

The plant in the Leyden Apuleius is rather less cabbage- like than in the Greek document, but in the allied Cassel MS. of the ninth century it is nearly as plump (Figs. 44 and 45).

The sinfitos text of the Leyden Apuleius contains the scribal errors usual in MSS. of the period. Its dog Latin text reads as follows : LVIII. HERBA SINFITOS ALII CONFIRMAM ALII CONSERBA ALII PECTES ITALI ARGALLICUM NASCITUR LOCIS PALUDIS ET CAMPIS HERBAE CONFIRMAM PULUERE MOLLIS SIMUL ET TRITUM PUTUI DABIS IN UINUM MOX FLUUIUM RESTRINGET</page><page sequence="45">THE HERBAL IN ANTIQUITY 45 In most of the texts of Apuleius, other than those of the line of Archetype y, our Sinfitos figures as Confirma, or as Confirma major, and the text associated with it runs :--' Herbae confirmae pulverem mollissime tritum potui dabis in vino, mox sanguinem restringit.' 78sa We may note that our English plant name ' Comfrey' comes to us from the synonym ' Confirma.' The Comfrey is Symphytum officinale of botanists, and is certainly neither the Symphytum of the papyrus nor of the Leyden Apuleius. We turn now to the PAOMMOC of the papyrus. The form of the plant has no resemblance to the picture of iAOMMOC in the Juliana Anicia. The Dioskuridean text gives, however, under the heading QAOMMOS, two synonyms which enable us to trace our plant. These are POMAIOI BEPBACKAOUM OIAE PAONON.78b We, therefore, turn to the Verbascum of the Leyden Apuleius and we find what we are seeking (Fig. 46). The iAOMMOC of our papyrus is represented in the Leyden Apuleius by its synonym of Verbascum. The figure in the Latin MS. (Fig. 46) is very stiff, but, as with Sinfitos, it bears a general resemblance to the Greek form. The Latin text associated with Verbascum in the Leyden Apuleius runs as follows (Fig. 46):- LXXI. HERUA UERBASCUM A GRAECIS DICITUR FLOGMON PROFETAE HERMURABDOS AEGYPTI NATAL DACI DIESSATHEL ITALI UERBASCUM DICUNT The account of the uses of the herb follows. This contains, like other passages in the text of the Apuleian herbal, elements of pagan magic which ally it to the incantations that frequently accompany it. The account of the uses of the herb ran, in its original form (of which we have in Fig. 46 only the first two lines), as follows : ' Hanc herbam dicitur Mercurius Ulyssi dedisse cum advenisset ad Circem, ut nulla mala facta ejus timeret. Adversus occursus malos. Herbae uerbasci uirgulam qui secum portaverit, nullo metu terrebitur, neque occursus mali molestabunt eum.' The resemblances between the figures of the Greek papyrus and those of the Leyden Latin MS. are sufficiently close to reveal a common tradition. The likeness is much closer, in fact, than between many of the Latin herbals or between many of the Greek herbals, the common tradition of which can be proved. I have handled originals or photographs of most of the illustrated Greek manuscript herbals and of a large number of the Latin, and I have no doubt that a common tradition lies behind the Latin Leyden and Cassel codices and the Papyrus herbal. 78a In most of the Apuleian herbal texts there is also a Symphytum album, which is different from the Sinfitos that we are here discussing. 78b The passage is unfortunately missing in the Juliana Anicia.</page><page sequence="46">46 CHARLES SINGER AcgtlcisON XI g CUt cfMr AccY'pTINAtek act ,I ess, %,r tL l e 16 A 6c uLt tc NT cl T vi R L sAstios-Is er Ac&lt; e-be 1 sabc fru lll t&gt; wlc U "Ks)k 50 )ss aara e N ssethbiltecy ~vil FIG. 46.-LEYDEiN APULEIUS, FO. 108. SEVENTH CENTURY. ' VERBASCUM.'</page><page sequence="47">THE HERBAL IN ANTIQUITY 47 When we turn from the Latin Apuleius MSS. to compare the Papyrus with the usual Greek herbal, we are met with a very different situation. The general arrangement of the Papyrus herbal is similar to that of the old Krateuas herbal. The drawing of the Papyrus, however, is stiff and formal, instead of naturalistic, as in the Krateuas herbal. The line of Greek herbals followed the Krateuas tradition, that of the Latin the tradition of the Johnson Papyrus. The stiff, formal tradition of plant presentation which existed in the fourth century among the Greeks had its future not in Greek but in Latin Europe, and is specially exhibited in the descendants of the herbal of pseudo-Apuleius. ? 15. The Associates of the Apuleius Herbal.-During the Middle Ages the herbal of Apuleius was usually combined with certain other opuscules. Among these was, firstly, a, little treatise De herba vettonica (i.e. betony), bearing the false ascription to Antonius Musa, the physician to Caesar Augustus; secondly. an anonymous work, De taxone, on the use of the badger in medicine; and, thirdly, a nauseating concoction bearing the name of Sextus Placitus Papyriensis, whoever he may have been, and the title Liber medicinae ex animalibus. None of these greatly concerns us, but there are three other works with which the herbal of Apuleius is often combined which are of interest for us. The first is Dioscorides vulgaris, which we have discussed in detail (? 12). The second is Dioscorides de herbis femininis. The third is a peculiar group of prayers or incantations. Dioscorides de herbisfemininis is a curious treatise consisting of a description of seventy-one herbs and their properties without the synonyms. It is drawn from the Latin Dioscorides, from pseudo-Apuleius and from Pliny. The earliest manuscript is of the ninth century,79 but the work was put together no later than the sixth century, since Isidore of Seville (c. 560-636) knew it. The De herbis femnininis was probably concocted in Italy during the domination of the Goths (493-555).80 Manuscripts of it are listed in confusion with the true Latin Dioscorides.sl It has been printed in modern times.82 The figures present many points of interest. Thus, for instance, some of them have affinities with those of the class #f of the Apuleius MSS. (p. 39), others with the illustrations of the class a of the Apuleius MSS., the stock from which the Anglo-Saxon Apuleius was derived.83 In some of the MSS. Dioscorides vulgaris and the De herbis femininis seem inextricably mixed. Lastly, we have to consider the prayers or incantations associated with a number of Apuleian MSS., including the earliest of them all, that at Leyden. These prayers, by invoking the earth goddess, preserve something of the pagan atmosphere in which the herbal first took its rise. There are several examples of these incantations in MSS. in this country. The Latin text of these 19 Rome, Barberini, 160. 80 M. Wellmann, Krateuas, in Abh. d. kgl. Gesellschaft d.

'Earth, divine goddess, Mother Nature, who generatest all things and bringest forth anew the sun which thou hast given to the nations, Guardian of sky and sea and of all gods and powers; through thy power all nature falls silent and then sinks in sleep. And again thou bringest back the light and chasest away night, and yet again thou coverest us most securely with thy shades. Thou dost contain chaos infinite, yea, and winds and showers and storms; thou sendest them out when thou wilt and causest the seas to roar; thou chasest away the sun and arousest the storm. Again, when thou wilt thou sendest forth the joyous day and givest the nourishment of life with thy eternal surety; and when the soul departs, to thee we return. Thou indeed art called duly great Mother of the gods; thou conquerest by the divine name. Thou art the source of the strength of nations and of gods, without thee nothing can be brought to per- fection or be born; thou art great, queen of the gods. Goddess ! I adore thee as divine; I call upon thy name; be pleased to grant that which I ask thee, so shall I give thanks to thee, goddess, with due faith. 'Hear, I beseech thee, and be favourable to my prayer. Whatsoever herb thy power dost produce, give, I pray, with goodwill to all nations to save them and grant me this my medicine. Come to me with thy powers, and how- soever I may use them, may they have good success, and to whomsoever I may give them. Whatever thou dost grant, may it prosper. To thee all things return. Those who rightly receive these herbs from me, do thou make them whole, goddess, I beseech thee. I pray thee as a suppliant that by thy majesty thou grant this to me. 'Now I make intercession to you, all ye powers and herbs and to your majesty; ye whom earth, parent of all, hath produced and given as a medicine of health to all nations and hath put majesty upon you, be, I pray you, the greatest help to the human race. This I pray and beseech from you, be present here with your virtues, for she who created you hath herself promised that I may gather you with the goodwill of him on whom the art of medicine was bestowed, and grant, for health's sake, good medicine by grace of your powers. 'I pray, grant me through your virtue that whatsoe'er is wrought by men through you may have in all its powers a good and speedy effect, and good success, and that I may always be permitted with the favour of your majesty to gather you with my hands and to glean your fruits; so shall I give thanks to you in the name of that majesty which ordained your birth.' ? 16. Dioskurides in the Orient.-We have spoken of the versions of Dioskurides in the Byzantine world and in the Latin West. His influence was, however, hardly less in the Arabic East. The text of his work was rendered into Arabic direct from the Greek, about the year 854, by Stephanos, son of Basilios, a Christian who lived at Baghdad under the Khalif Motawakkil. His work was perhaps revised by Joannitius 85 (809-873). In this translation 84 A bibliography is given by Mr. A. D. Nock, Folklore, XXXVI. p. 93, London, 1925, in an article in which he corrects some of the writer's errors. 15 Sylvestre de Sacy, Abd-Allatif Relation de l'Egypte, pp. 495 and 549.</page><page sequence="49">THE HERBAL IN ANTIQUITY 49 Stephanos translated the Greek plant names into Arabic when he could, but when his knowledge failed he left them in Greek in the hope that 'God would raise up someone who might translate them.' This imperfect version by Stephanos was in general circulation in Arabic- speaking countries until 948. In that year the Byzantine Emperor Romanus II, son and co-regent of Constantine Porphyrogenitos, sent to the Spanish Khalif, Abd-Arrahman III, a finely illustrated Greek MS. of Dioskurides as a gift. At that time there was no one in Spain who knew Greek, and the Khalif therefore asked the Byzantine monarch to provide an interpreter. In 951 a learned monk, Nicolas, was sent who gave open instruction in Greek to many physicians at Cordova. It appears that Nicolas and his Arabic-speaking pupils set to work on the old translation of Stephanos, corrected it and adjusted its transliterated words, and produced something in the way of a new version.86 About the middle of the thirteenth century, the Syriac scholar Bar Hebraeus prepared a translation into Syriac with illustrations. This also passed into Arabic. A number of illustrated Arabic MSS. of Dioskurides are known. How far the figures of these MSS. are based on those of the MS. on which Nicolas worked, how far on those of Bar Hebraeus, and how far they belong to the new tradition, is, as yet, unknown. The figures of many of the plants of the Greek Dioskurides, taken mostly from the Mediterranean littoral, would have been useless to the majority of Oriental readers. A certain number of new figures were prepared and further items added. A new tradition thus arose which continues to this day in the East, where the work of Dioskurides is still in current use.87 The whole practice of medicine among Arabic-speaking peoples has been influenced by Dioskurides. ? 17. The Latter End of the Herbal in the Occident.-We have traced the herbal from antiquity to the dawn of modern times. It is appropriate to terminate with a few words on the latter end of the herbal in Western Europe. We have seen an early instance of naturalism in a herbal of the twelfth century (Bodley 130; see p. 39). The movement towards naturalism, however, did not set in with any force until the end of the fourteenth or the beginning of the fifteenth century. It then affected chiefly the newer texts, such as that of the Circa Instans (p. 37), of which several finely illustrated MSS. are known.88 With the advent of printing, complex herbal compendia, derived from the old as well as the new sources, began to appear. Some of the textual material, as well as some of the illustrations of these works, were of the ancient traditional form, some were borrowed from such mediaeval compilations as the Circa Instans, some were really new. A fine volume of this compound type was that 86 E. H. F. Meyer, Geschichte der Botanik, Kbnigsberg, 1852-57, III. p. 136. 87 On Dioskurides in the Orient see works by M.

Old works were annotated and critically examined; new works were written; scientific botany was born. The history of the subject in the later fifteenth and in the sixteenth centuries has been well traced by Dr. Arber and Dr. Klebs.90 In the seventeenth century botany began to turn away from the herbal. The system that it represents passed into ever less competent hands. The herbal, however, did not altogether perish, and it lingers yet. Scattered here and there among the meaner streets of our great cities are shops bearing over the window the word Herbalist. In these little dens of bygone superstition the artless folklorist sometimes seeks for remnants of early English folk belief. Such remnants are, in fact, surprisingly rare and few. If he enter in search of them the innocent inquirer will either be disappointed or, if satisfied, he will be deceived. The lore that the out-at-elbow practitioner purveys to him is not that of the ancient Anglo-Saxon, whose medical system was too debased or too primitive to survive. It is rather the misunderstood and misinterpreted remains of Pliny and Apuleius, of Dioskurides and Galen, perverted at fortieth hand. Our herbalist's methods are tinged too with Astrology. As like as not his whole library consists of one of the numerous descendants of Nicholas Culpepper's English Physician Enlarged of 1643. This poor, shabby and pretentious fellow, half deceived and half deceiver, is the descendant of Diokles of Athens and Krateuas of Pontus. Their lore has come to him through the ages in an unbroken though contaminated line. ? 18. Conclusions.--The numbering of the Conclusions corresponds to that of the preceding ??. (1) There were no Greek herbals earlier than the fourth century B.C. (2) The earliest herbal we know of is that of Diokles, c. 350 B.C. The earliest herbal which survives is the 9th book of the Historia plantarum of Theo- phrastus. It is a collection from other herbals, and is not by Theophrastus. It is probably of Alexandrian date, say about 250 B.C. (3) Of other Alexandrian herbals we have few records. None has survived. The work, however, of Nikander (c. 200 B.C.) has come down to us. We have rough figures of an illustrated copy of Nikander which goes back to a classical original. (4) Krateuas (c. 75 B.C.) of Pontus was the first to prepare a herbal with illustrations drawn from the objects. He omitted the description of plants and fixed the form of the herbal. He is the father of botanical illustration. (5) We can restore part of the herbal of Krateuas, both as to text and figures, from the Juliana Anicia Codex of A.D. 512, aided by hints from a new illustrated papyrus herbal of about A.D. 400. 89 W.

Among them were those of Pamphilos of Rome, part of whose work On Plants survives; of Menecrates, physician to the Emperor Tiberius, who originated Diachylon plaster; of Andromachus, who invented a complex antidote or ' mithridate 'that persisted into modern times; of Servilius Damo- crates, of whose herbal we have considerable fragments, and of the army surgeon Dioskurides of Anazarba. (7) The work of Dioskurides has survived entire. It is the most influential herbal ever written, but was based on earlier herbals. There are Dioskuridean names in modern botany and a number of Dioskuridean drugs in modern medicine. (8) At an early date the text of Dioskurides was associated with plant pictures, some from Krateuas, some from other sources. It was associated also with a list of synonyms in various languages. The resulting combination was the main herbal in use in the Byzantine period. Many MSS. have survived, and their line can be traced down to modern times. The finest and earliest is the Juliana Anicia, with many figures in the Krateuan tradition. An important element .in the Dioskuridean texts that have come down to us is the list of synonyms derived from languages, many of which are now unknown. (9) Of Greek herbals after Dioskurides only the De simplicibus of Galen (c. A.D. 180) was of importance. Oribasios borrows from it for his Synagoge of about A.D. 400. The herbal works of Dioskurides, Galen and Oribasios were all early translated into Latin. (10) There is a Greek illustrated papyrus herbal of about A.D. 400 which we designate the Johnson Papyrus. It has figures of 'Symphyton' and 'Phlommos.' It is important because- (a) It is our earliest original of a herbal the general form of which is of the Krateuas and Apuleius type. (b) Though in Greek, its drawings are of a different tradition to that of other Greek herbals and different from the drawings of Krateuas. (c) Its two drawings are stiff and conventional and strongly resemble those of certain early Latin Apuleius herbals, with two of which they can be identified. (d) Remnants of the tradition represented by the figures of the Papyrus herbal persisted to modern times among the Latins. (11) The earliest native Latin herbals were saturated with Magic. Pliny's herbal (c. A.D. 60) is Greek material. We have also herbals written in Latin in the third and fourth centuries A.D. (12) Dioskurides was translated into Latin in the sixth century. Two distinct versions are available, designated as Dioscorides Lombardus and Dios- corides vulgaris. The illustrations to Lombardus are peculiar. The vulgaris type includes nearly all of the vast number of MSS. Many of the illustrations of this main line were doubtless of the Krateuan tradition. The illustrations have become greatly modified in transit. An interesting branch of the Latin herbal is the Anglo-Saxon version made about A.D. 1000. Dioscorides vulgaris is usually associated with other texts, notably that of 'Apuleius.' The vulgaris carried over with it from the Greek the ancient synonym lists. E2</page><page sequence="52">52 CHARLES SINGER (13) The most important Latin herbal has the name of Apuleius attached to it. It early became associated with synonyms similar to those of Dioskurides. Two of these synonyms occur as titles in the Papyrus herbal. 'Apuleius' became associated with other material, notably with the Latin Dioscorides. The MSS. of Apuleius are exceedingly numerous. Their line can be traced into modern times. The Anglo-Saxon branch is again of peculiar interest. The earliest naturalistic plant-drawings are in a MS. of Apuleius-Dioscorides written in England (c. 1120). The tradition of the Apuleian illustrations can be traced continuously to the time of printing, and the first printed herbal has figures like those of an Anglo-Saxon herbal. (14) In the earliest MS. of Apuleius (c. 650) are two figures that can be identified with those of the Johnson Papyrus (c. 400). The Apuleius and Papyrus herbals agree in general form. Apuleius is a translation of a Greek original similar to that of the Papyrus. Its illustrations have thus a different tradition from those of the Latin Dioscorides vulgaris or Lombardus. (15) ' Apuleius,' Dioscorides vulgaris, Dioscorides de herbis femininis,, are all constantly found associated and intermixed with certain other texts. Among these other texts is a set of pagan invocations to the earth goddess which recall the conditions under which the herbal first came into being. (16) Dioskurides became popular in the Arabic East as it did in the Greek and Latin West. His work was translated into Arabic about 854 at Baghdad. In 951 a new Arabic version was prepared at Cordova. About 1250, a Syriac translation with illustrations was prepared and an Arabic version again from that. A number of Arabic MSS. of Dioskurides are known. The descent neither of the Arabic texts nor of the illustrations that accompany some of them has been traced, but the illustrations have no clear relationship to those of the classical line. (17) The classical tradition persisted to the days of printing. It then became diluted with new material, but was not wholly destroyed. Modern herbalists still practise the ancient herbal lore. The story of the herbal can thus be told almost continuously from the fourth century B.C.91 CHARLES SINGER. 91 In addition to the acknowledgements made in the text, the author has to thank Messrs.
