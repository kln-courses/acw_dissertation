WERTH ABSTRACT Concepts from evolutionary biology are conjoined with a Kantian- and Nietzschian based critique to demonstrate that our human concepts and perspective are hopelessly 'earthbound.' Unless the caprice of evolutionary biology on some Earth-like planet replicates the evolutionary history of Earth, we shall not recognise alien intelligence. To suggest that another planet is likely to produce a recognisable intelligence because its evolutionary history is similar to ours is simply absurd, but will seem absurd only to those with a knowledge of bio-evolution, an understanding of our linguistic and syntactical abilities, and concepts of space, time, and causality. This conclusion may appear heavy-handed, even pedestrian. However, a closer scrutiny reveals that it is the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence which is naive. Recent evidence of there having been life on Mars has prompted the question, 'Could there have been intelligent life on Mars or elsewhere?' The existence of extraterrestrial life, or lifeforms which once may have lived on Mars, presents no overwhelming conceptual problems. Scientists know what sort of data are relevant to the search for simple lifeforms, particularly when the investigation is based upon analogy, that is, that extraterrestrial life is similar to that evolved on Earth. What is neither clearly understood nor properly appreciated are the overwhelming and perhaps insuperable conceptual problems of recognising allegedly intelligent extraterrestrial life should we happen to encounter any. Those who study comparative psychology are aware of the perils of anthropomorphism, particularly with respect to primates closely related to us. Do chimpanzees truly understand and use language? If an orangutan looks into a mirror and sees a reflection of herself with a spot of red paint on her forehead, and then attempts to remove the paint by wiping her brow, does this entail a concept of self or at least the knowledge that the reflected image is her reflection? [1] Monkeys seem unable to recognise 'their' reflections, unlike orangutans. Clearly, we are unable to understand the consciousness of another species except by generalising from human experience. Empathic understanding, even when grounded in empirical data as in the mirror experiment, has limited utility. We are permanently stuck in an anthropocentric predicament. Has it not become commonplace to claim that even within the confines of the human species, disparate groups are unable to truly understand one another's experience? Those engaged in literary criticism tell us that any interpretation is hopelessly tainted by the time and culture from which the criticism originates. Women claim that men are unable to understand what women experience; racial and ethnic minorities make similar claims. Indeed, it is sometimes argued that language, our allegedly common conceptual currency, © Society for Applied Philosophy, 1998, Blackwell Publishers, 108 Cowley Road, Oxford, OX4 1JF, UK and 350 Main Street, Maiden, MA 02148, USA.</page><page sequence="2">84 L. F. Werth is incapable of correctly characterising the experiences of oppressed groups since its expressive adequacy has been shaped and limited by those in power. Did a male coin the term, 'male chauvinism'? The poverty of language can be seen in terms of Orwell's Newspeak; the words to express the experiences of those unempowered, that is, those lacking a voice, simply do not exist, until their struggle to be heard yields music, poetry, and eventually a change in our vocabulary [2]. Against this background of earthly confusion and failures to communicate, let us examine the epistemological difficulties associated with recognising E.T.I, (extraterres trial intelligence). In so doing we will better understand our own thought processes and the evolutionary selection pressures on planet Earth which have determined the way in which we inescapably conceive of the universe. If 'anyone' is out there, it is unlikely we could know it, not unless the selection pressures on 'their' planet were virtually identical to those on Earth, which would entail that the caprice of biological mutations on that planet were a carbon copy of mutations on Earth, a scenario that taxes all credibility even allowing thousands of lightyears of space-time in which to search. Science fiction readers will consider the above hopelessly pedestrian: lifeforms need not be carbon based, and intelligent creatures need not resemble humans. Surely intelligence might be manifested by a species which appears to be a puddle of slime. It is exactly this sort of claim that collapses under closer scrutiny. If there exists intelligent slime, the sort of intelligence 'it' has would be unrecognisable to us. Let us examine the basis for this claim. In so doing we will come to a better understanding of ourselves, but at the risk of increasing our sense of alienation as a species conceptually imprisoned on Earth. There is something of a paradox involved in the account which follows: evolutionary biology will be used as the basis for claiming that we are hopelessly locked in an anthropocentric predicament, that is, we must conceive of the universe in human terms. Yet this very argument, if successful, will undermine itself. It will explain why we can not recognise E.T.I., but in so doing it also condemns us to a biologically based perspective which by its own canons of reasoning entails limitations. The biologically grounded perspective of our place in the universe ultimately stultifies itself by being a product of the very conceptual limitations it can explicate! Nietzsche, perhaps more than other philosophers, understood the problem [3]. Our brains have been programmed by the selection pressures of our environment. We are land animals who live on a planet of cyclical changes, but changes which are sufficiently erratic to preclude a simple algorithm which would allow land organisms such as ourselves to rely wholly upon instinct for our survival, so-called instinct being a biologically programmed information processing system which requires neither consciousness nor the capacity to learn diverse responses to a changing environment. Our bodies and brains obviously evolved together, but it is a helpful thought experiment to consider how a body such as ours could survive without our indigenous human conceptual capacities. If Nietzsche recognised the 'prejudices of philosophers' and the problem of under standing perspectives only from the perspective of a perspective, Immanuel Kant can be credited with discerning those patterns of information processing, which being human, we can not transcend. In his Critique of Pure Reason, Kant clarified not only what he called the categories of the human understanding, but the manner in which human experience is inextricably presented spatially and temporally, or in terms which Kant called the pure forms of outer and inner intuition[4]. It hardly matters whether time and space (space time) exist independently of our minds. What is relevant to the present problem is a © Society for Applied Philosophy, 1998</page><page sequence="3">The Anthropocentric Predicament and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence 85 Kantian insight, that is, that the categories we use to experience things and events are hopelessly anthropocentric; biological selection pressures have determined the categories we use to construct and thereby experience objects and events: quantity; quality; causality; possibility; necessity; real; unreal; etc. Without presenting either an organised list nor a comprehensive one, it should be clear that to experience anything and to recognise that we are experiencing it, we must employ such categories and concepts. Are they universal to all rational creatures? Even judged from within the perspective of biological evolution it becomes depressingly obvious that such categories and relationships are of utility to land creatures who live in the quasi-cyclical environment which Earth provides, an environment of changing conditions both on land and sea, changes primarily due to the tilt of Earth's axis, other changes resulting from plate tectonics, etc. And yet it will be argued that other planets are sufficiently Earthlike for E.T.I. A closer look is in order. Those who search for E.T.I, believe that basic physical or logical relations can be used to establish communication, and so we broadcast or send by satellite: a prime number series; perhaps a model of our solar system; atomic vibrations; a periodic table of elements; binary math and bivalency; or whatever physical or logical relation we think to be universal. But consider: mathematics to base ten is a product of our being creatures with ten fingers; bivalency is tied to our being creatures who rely greatly upon our visual and tactile senses, senses which provide clearly bounded and defined objects ... a table which is either there or not. If olfactory sense had predominated, we would have relied upon what's called fuzzy logic. Yet a table is mass which is either there or not? Surely, some sort of communication is possible. This is to overlook that the very objects we encounter are in a certain sense arbitrary constructs. The book is not part of the table because I can pick it up. Yet if I can remove the table's legs, what then? Either I take apart the table or destroy it. What is an object to us depends upon our context of interest. Since other humans are biologically similar, the objects designated as real tend to be the same, if we ignore debates about ghosts and spirits. Our objects are conceptual constructs based upon the organisation of sensory input. The organisation has resulted from the selection pressures that have produced our species. Even so, we can imagine how an 'object' might have been constructed differently, perhaps by restricting objects to only one sense such that what is seen is not the same object as what is touched or smelled; or perhaps by taking what is most intensely sensed and making one object out of what is loudest, brightest, heaviest, etc. This would not be a useful object for any context other than to clarify a philosophical argument. If these remarks have served their purpose, we shall understand that any E.T.I, will have encountered different selection pressures which will have resulted in their environment being incommensurable with ours. To further elaborate: consider our time concepts and the associated concept of causation. Not only do we attend to the immediate present, we consider the future and evaluate the past. For such conceptual gymnastics to be possible, we create a virtual reality for ourselves: we visualise what we take to be possible futures; or we reconsider the past in terms of counterfactual conditionals, that is, we consider what would have happened had things happened differently. Indeed, we do this with respect to the present, e.g., if I had more time I might get more done and do a better job. Do other primates utilise the range of time concepts humans employ? Are there chimpanzees engaged in regret who resolve to be better chimps in the future? Consider the human infant and its needs, and how those without foresight and who could not learn from past mistakes would have never been able to protect their progeny, at least not on this planet. © Society for Applied Philosophy, 1998</page><page sequence="4">86 L. F. Wenh If physical objects are the arbitrary constructs resulting from the caprice of contexts of interest, produced and driven by selection pressures on Earth, the same is true of what we call events. Whereas an object seems to us to be somehow given, an event seems more malleable. For a sudden rain squall to be an event we must define a beginning and end. Moreover, unlike objects such as tables, events are often heterogeneous; a physical object might be multifaceted but not diverse in the manner of a three day celebration, for example. The temporal edges of events often lack clear definition; there is frequently no starting gun nor finish line. Such malleability makes it obvious to those of different cultures how arbitrarily events are conceived. We may not recognise an event if we do not share the relevant cultural presuppositions. How much worse would it be in attempting to communicate with E.T.I., even assuming 'they' have temporal concepts, which presupposes selection pressures similar to ours, that is, environmental challenges which have given rise to the ability to create virtual realities, in our case through visualisation and symbol use? There is little reason to believe that E.T.I, would have anything approximating our emotional spectrum: sexual reproduction at least on this planet seems associated with territoriality, jealousy, lust, maternal feeling, love, if not also fear, anger, greed, etc. As to intellectual curiosity — perhaps C. S. Peirce was correct. Thinking is simply a way to bring about belief, and thereby end the irritation we feel when in a state of doubt [5]. If so, curiosity is merely a means to avoid pain, and pain as a state functions to motivate organisms to avoid damaging stimulus. Have we any reason to believe E.T.I, would be a candidate for mutual empathy? If so, this requires that 'their' environment be analogous to Earth's; but for this to be the case, the sequences of mutations and positive and negative feedback mechanisms which have produced our present atmosphere, flora and fauna must have been virtually identical. A suspension of disbelief is appropriate when reading science fiction, otherwise we could not have empathy for the aliens, were they not to have concepts and emotions in common with us. Unfortunately, the requirements for fiction and those for actually recognising E.T.I, significantly differ. Our discretely bounded objects of touch and vision have prompted us to develop a system of natural numbers, discrete and individual units which we employ in our conceptual bookkeeping. Subsequently, we discovered the irrational numbers and the nondenumerable, but we began by counting our fingers. Would E.T.I.'s math be commensurable with ours? Consider language: is it a cause for hope? Human languages which have no common root are nevertheless intertranslatable, although not without difficulty. Yet field anthropologists learn languages unrelated to their own. Moreover, it is possible to construct a dictionary, thereby showing that only differences in surface grammar exist. Why would radio communication be impossible if E.T.I, is a language user? When we remember that any medium of communication to be used in the search for E.T.I, must ultimately be transduced into a form accessible to human senses and cognitive capacities, hope fades. Computers can help us to analyse vast amounts of data for patterns, but once again, the patterns must be humanly recognisable patterns. We have seen how that constrains us. Language in itself is rather peculiar. Recent and contemporary philosophers have studied the subject-predicate form, or what F. H. Bradley describes in terms of a 'that' which is a 'what'[6], Indeed our question: 'What's that?' captures Bradley's point. We also have verbs and adverbs so as to communicate action and not merely states of being. © Society for Applied Philosophy, 1998</page><page sequence="5">The Anthropocentric Predicament and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence 87 Yet the difference between an action and a state of being seems a matter of temporal perspective. Slow down a movie (or speed it up) and what was an action becomes a state, or conversely. How are we to know the temporal perspective of aliens, if indeed they have time concepts? Assuming E.T.I, has a body with a central nervous system is again an instance of anthropomorphic thinking. Just as a neuron in our brains is unaware that it contributes to our consciousness (although without neurons there would be no consciousness), by parity of reasoning E.T.I.'s consciousness might involve a multitude of bodies. For that matter, we might be part of that consciousness without realising it or ever being able to realise it, anymore than the neurons in our brains individually are cognisant of their respective functions. Speculation based upon biology arises within the perspective of biology, a perspective which reveals its limitations. We have little reason to hope to recognise E.T.I., even when we create 'them' in our image, that is, the images allowed by biological evolutionary theory. But such a theory is hopelessly Earthbound. Even within the constraints of our conventional notions for what constitutes an organism and an environment, we have seen how changes in temporal perspective and/or alternative ways of organising sensory input, can completely alter what would constitute an object or an event. And if 'their' sense organs are also different, as would be the case if radiowaves could be 'seen,' an empty room to us could be awash in an opaque sea of electromagnetic radiation from 'their' perspective. Our respective worlds could easily be incommensurable even assuming that they too have concepts of space, time, causation, object, event, quality, quantity, etc., and use a subject-predicate means of communication. Yet, unless 'their' biological evolution closely mirrors ours, there is little reason to believe 'their' world will be conceptualised analogously to ours. 'They' need not only not use our concepts of space, time, etc., E.T.I, might not employ concepts at all, or at least nothing we could identify as a concept. From our Earthbound perspective, we simply lack the capacity to imagine their 'perspective.' How could we possibly conceive the inconceivable. Philosophically, the classical problem of trying to describe or conceive of Kant's noumena reemerges in the context of the search for E.T.I. If we conceive of the universe in human terms, and what choice have we, then let us not demand that the universe itself be constrained by the limits of human understanding. In one sense, we are left tragically alone and alienated as a species. But in another sense we can recognise that what we call the universe is fraught with inconceivable 'possibilities.' Have we not learned that 'the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose'? [7], Lee F.
