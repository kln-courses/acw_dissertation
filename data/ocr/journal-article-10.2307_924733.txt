<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. 35, No. 2 ETHNOMUSICOLOGY SPRING/SUMMER 1991 Sociological Factors in Musicological Poetics HENRY KINGSBURY BROWN UNIVERSITY F or all the attention which has of late been given to the idea that cultural forms are constituted through discourse, or to the literary/textual character of nearly all scholarly writing, it is still not altogether common- place-even, or perhaps particularly, in ethnomusicology-that musicologi- cal rhetoric is based on figurative imagery. I think there can be little doubt of the need for what might be called a "poetic for musicology" (cf. Brown 1977). In what follows I will be focusing on a conjunction of three domains: one literary, one sociological, and one musical. More particularly, I will be looking at the sociological implications of musicological writing and the social configurations implicated in the rhetorical imagery of musicological discourse. The underlying argument of this paper is that the figurative diction of musicology has sociological (for which one may read political, although some of the discussion will also focus on law and jurisprudence) as well as literary significance.' The Warp and the Weft Musicological discourse might well be viewed as a fabric, having both a horizontal dimension-a warp-and a vertical dimension-a weft. By the warp I mean the rhetorical-verbal organization of the narrative, and particularly the play of metaphoric/tropological domains that make up the musicological story. The weft is the ways in which the narrative is inflected by real-world actors: representations of composers, projections of the author's or the reader's "voice" into the account. The notions of warp and 1I owe a debt of thanks to many people who contributed insightful commentary on earlier versions of this paper. In Providence, I got valuable suggestions on earlier drafts from James Baker, Katherine Hagedorn, David Josephson, Rose Subotnik, and Jeff Titon. An earlier version was also presented at colloquia in the San Francisco bay area in November, 1990; thanks to Karol Berger, Philip Brett, and Richard Taruskin, as well as to a number of energetic graduate students at Berkeley, especially Anthony Brown, William Evans, and Eric Hirsch, who long after the wine and cheese was gone, gave invaluable-the word is not misused-words of stimulation and support. 195</page><page sequence="2">1E6 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 weft may be helpful in dealing with the relationship between the metaphoric images that populate the narratives of musicological writing and the palpable, warm-blooded persons who read and write such accounts. The variety of rhetorical projections of social and personal perspective provide important clues as to the manner in which such texts will be interpreted. However, such a play of projections also means that textual interpretation devolves to sociological interpretation. This, in spite of the fact that the persons and social institutions that are in fact projected into the text often have a sufficiently singular hold on what Frank Kermode (1979) would have called the "license to exegesis" as to make diversity of interpretation seem impossible, and thus give the text the appearance of immanent transparency. Heretofore, the "warp" appears to have received the more scholarly attention. For example, for some time it has been understood that the metaphoric organization of musicological writing plays an essential role in constituting the domain of musicology and music theory (Solie 1979, 1982; Kerman 1980, 1983; Treitler 1969). However, the rhetorical organization of musicological discourse also contributes to the social organization of a community of musicians and musicologists. It is this aspect of musicological writing that I am calling the weft. For example, and at the risk of getting ahead of my story, the architectural metaphors of "form" and "structure" can be seen to be tropes through which the musicological community injects its collective voice into the meaning of "absolute" music, and thus retain a considerable, if not total, control over its meaning. In light of recent scholarship pointing to the pervasive character of figurative diction in everyday language (Lakoff &amp; Johnson 1980; DeMan 1978) it is perhaps not surprising that music-related discourse is largely dependent on metaphoric diction. And it is everywhere. Not only is architectural imagery apparent whenever we hear of musical "structure," but some form of spatial modality can be discerned in such seemingly everyday notions as "scale" (which originally meant "step"), harmonic "progression," "leading" tone, or "roving" harmony. The metaphoric character of "ascend- ing" motion is thrown into relief by the fact that both the classic Greeks and the 'Are 'Are of Melanesia (Zemp 1979) represent melodic motion in the reverse, of going down to what we would call the treble. Of course, spatial-architectural imagery is not the only domain invoked in musicological rhetoric; indeed it may not even be the most fundamental one. Kerman (1980) and Solie (1979, 1982) have both put forth thoughtful discussions of the centrality of organismic metaphor in musicology, with Kerman, for example, going so far as to say that the enterprise of musical analysis "stands or falls" on the image of the composition as organism. Similarly, the writing of Heinrich Schenker is fairly surging with organismic and anthropomorphic imagery. Schenker's writing is riddled with references</page><page sequence="3">Sociological Factors in Musicological Poetics 197 to the "egotism" of tones, to which he attributes any number of other human characteristics: The phenomenon of the partials could be derived from a kind of procreative urge of the tones, and the tonal system, particularly the natural [major] one, could be seen as a sort of higher collective order, similar to a state, based on its own social contracts by which the individual tones are bound to abide (Schenker 1954 [1906]:84). In Schenker's writing there is frequently a tone of mythic allegory: Nature's help to music consisted of nothing but a hint, a counsel forever mute, whose perception and interpretation were fraught with the gravest difficulties. No one could exaggerate, hence, the admiration and gratitude we owe to the intuitive power with which the artists have divined Nature (Schenker 1954 [19061:20). About Schenker, more in a moment. In the meantime it is worth mentioning that musical discourse is not above (or beneath!) occasional rhetorical evocations of supernatural or theological elements: a reviewer might say for example, that a particular singer "achieved that rarest of things, unity with the music." And moving quickly from God to mammon, the imagery (and let us not forget that it is imagery) of "talent" brings with it a plethora of concerns which are at bottom economic. Talent, after all, is a metaphor for currency, or more precisely, capital (Matthew 25:14-30), and imagery of music and musicality as (scarce) resource abound, ranging from the conservatory student said to have "a lot" of technique to John Blacking's most famous title, How Musical is Man? Thus while the range of categorical domains available to musicological metaphor may not be as wide as the sea, it is considerable. However, perhaps more significant than any single domain, or even the variety available to musicological writers, is the fact that musicological diction is ineluctibly intertextual, built of mixed metaphors and overlapping rhetorics. The lexicon of musicological diction comprises a veritable kaleidoscope of mixed metaphor. Arnold Schoenberg, making a pictoral chart to represent the "regions" of the harmonies within a key, notes that "the order of the regions in the chart of minor is the reverse of the order in major. In spite of the close relations, the change of gender (i.e., from major to minor keys) requires caution" (Schoenberg 1969:30, emphasis and parentheses original). Similar examples of mixed metaphor could be found almost at random from most standard university-level music theory texts. My point is not simply to demonstrate the metaphoric basis of musicological diction, important as that is, or to enumerate the domains available to musicological metaphor. Rather it is to discuss the link connecting musicology construed as literature with the production and interpretation of musicological texts construed as social action. My own</page><page sequence="4">158 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 interest in this approach is grounded in my earlier ethnographic research (Kingsbury 1988), where I was struck not only by the ever-shifting every- day meanings of key words like "music," "feeling," and "structure," but also by the fact that written texts-both verbal and musical-were so constantly invoked in the social interaction among conservatory students and teachers. Printed texts are not simply read and interpreted as artistic, literary, and/or musical documents, but also and at the same time are invoked as authoritative resources in the context of institutional and para-institutional negotiation. The interpretations of texts are central con- cerns of social organization, and social groupings are closely interconnected with the interpretations of texts. Thus my categories of warp and weft are not always distinct; that warp "overlaps" with weft is entailed in the metaphor itself-it might be suggested that through the various devices of projection the weft becomes the warp, or that the weft flows into the warp, or perhaps that it becomes entangled with the warp. Background There is, of course, an important scholarly tradition which applies the approaches of literary analysis to scholarly writing. An early example is Stanley Hyman's The Tangled Bank, "a study of the writings of Darwin, Marx, Frazer and Freud as imaginative organizations, as though they were poems ... it is the thesis of this book that the power and influence of their ideas is due in some substantial part to their ability as imaginative writers" (1959:ix, x). A similar and ultimately more influential formulation of this perspective was that of the historian Hayden White, who pointed out that the writing of history is "an essentially poetic act, in which [the historian] prefigures the historical field and constitutes it as a domain" (White 1973:x, emphasis original). In recent years there has been something of a "growth industry" in studies of the rhetorical organization of scholarly writing (see, for example, Marcus 1986, Brown 1977, White 1973). That such a perspective is gradually making inroads into musicology can be seen in insightful recent papers by Marion Guck and Robert Snarrenberg. Guck's paper, "Analytical Fictions," puts forth the notion that musical analysis is fiction, that musical scholars are, among other things, writers, and that as writers they "face ... the same issues regarding the shaping of text as their literary colleagues" (Guck 1990:1). In keeping with this, she has undertaken a brief literary analysis of scholarly works of musical analysis. Her fundmental finding, reduced to capsule form, is one of intertextuality. Thus, one particular passage grounded largely in inanimate physical imagery also incorporates images of active social agency. This "creates an inconsistency in [theorist Alan Forte's] portrayal, but that .., is the way things usually go. Analytical texts typically interweave different fictions" (Guck 1990:4).</page><page sequence="5">Sociological Factors in Musicological Poetics 199 Moreover, where Guck has found "fictions," Robert Snarrenberg has found "myths." For Snarrenberg, musical analyses tend to be "stories we tell among ourselves in order to preserve ourselves as a community of like- minded music-makers" (Snarrenberg 1990:10). "Fictional worlds... give expression to social and ethical commitments and in turn affect theoretical behavior." Snarrenberg's concern is with the procreative imagery that informs so much of Schenker's writing: Man repeats himself in man; tree in tree. In other words, any creature repeats itself in its own kind, and only in its own kind; and by this repetition the concept "man" or the concept "tree" is formed. Thus a series of tones becomes an individual in the world of music only by repeating itself in its own kind; and, as in nature in general, so music manifests a procreative urge, which initiates this process of repetition (Schenker 1954: 6). Snarrenberg finds a preponderance of female imagery ("the Urlinie's motherly womb") in Schenker's early writing, but also finds an incursion of masculine imagery ("the seed of all the powers") in the later development of what he calls the "passing tone theorem." The incursion of masculine imagery, says Snarrenberg, was because "such a thoroughgoing feminization of genius would surely be unconscionable" to Schenker (Snarrenberg 1990:3), who also wrote forcefully on the "natural" superiority of men. Snarrenberg also points out that the procreative-organicist imagery "was one of the first things to be lost when Schenker's ideas were translated to America." Schenkerism in America, he notes, was largely dehumanized, organized instead around architectural, spatial imagery, and that American theorists invoking Schenker came to be progressively scientistic and atomistic. He attributes this latter fact to "inattention to metaphor" and "misreading... another author's text" on the part of the New World Schenkerians, although it might be equally appropriate to suggest that the supposedly Schenkerian Americans were not just "translating" Schenker in the new world, but writing modernist theory while invoking Schenker. In either case, what is fundamental to Snarrenberg's account is the idea that musicological imagery is an expression, a reflection, or embodiment of important social values. "We should be careful," he concludes, "to choose images and stories that accord with our values" (1990:12). The Sociology of Textual Interpretation: I In this connection, it has always seemed to me that much of the inanimate imagery (for example, architectural notions such as "structure," "form," "level," and "bridge") that informs what is called musical "analysis" is an articulation of the value of social stability. Such imagery connotes something that has stood the test of time, monumemtal music whose permanence has been assured by its greatness---specifically in contrast with</page><page sequence="6">ZO Etbnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 supposedly less-great music such as folk, rock, or pop. Or rather, perhaps I should say that such values were an important context in which I was taught the vocabulary of musical analysis, and that thus those images connote fixity to me and, I would suspect, to many others. As a somewhat foreshortened illustration of the musical uses of architectural imagery, consider the unfinished dependent clause, "when you get to the end of the -." As it is, the clause is unmistakably spatial, inviting such conclusions as "hall, the pantry is on the right," or "driveway, turn left." But the clause could also be used metaphorically in a musical connection. When a piano teacher tells a student, "when you get to the end of the phrase, make it breathe," we are dealing not only with a mix of inorganic with organic metaphor, a combination of inconsistent "fictions," as Guck might call it, but at the same time with a combination of two fundamental values of music education. In this sentence, a student has been told to metaphorically enter into inanimate, architectonic (fixed and permanent) musical "space" but also to give it life, to make it animate and breathing. The performer is metaphorically being told not just to participate in the canonized repertoire, but to become personally involved in it, to add her/his personal musical "voice" to that of the larger musical community. The performer is being told to honor what is written in the text, but at the same time to play with feeling. This, at least, is the interpretation that I would be inclined to give to such an utterance. Admittedly, the matter of which social values are being inflected in musicological imagery is rarely self-evident, and is at least partially a function of the reader's perspective. While Snarrenberg was struck in the writings of American Schenkerians such as Forte, by the "passivity of the musical object" (Snarrenberg 1990:10) in contrast with the activity of the analyst, I would probably have been more inclined to call attention to the fixity of the musical object in contrast with the relative transience of activities such as analysis or performance. To call attention to interpretive variation, however, is hardly to suggest that such complexities make it inappropriate to infer cultural values from musicological diction. It is only to warn that such inferences may not be made uniformly across the musical community. For this reason we must beware of the hazards of adapting anthropological reports from exotic societies in which symbolic themes are given culture-wide applicability. For example, Feld's discussion of the waterfall imagery pervasive to Kaluli talk about song, and Zemp's descriptions of the bamboo metaphors that ground 'Are 'Are musical discourse are of course valuable for having called attention to the metaphoric implications of music-related discourse. However, while Feld was apparently comfortable in comparing the Kaluli with the 'Are 'Are in terms of their "core natural images," it would be a mistake to think that any single symbolic domain could bring to Western musicological discourse</page><page sequence="7">Sociological Factors in Musicological Poetics 201 the "broad mythical and everyday cultural salience both materially and ideationally" that Feld found in Kaluli waterfalls (Feld 1981:44). Whether or not the Kaluli are galvanized around a single set of images (waterfalls) in their musical talk, the fact is that we Westerners are not, but rather are organized around a communal play of figurative language. In other words, while I heartily endorse Snarrenberg's strategy of taking musical analysis as the subject of literary analysis, the problem of interpreting musicological writing is not simply one of demonstrating the relationship between particular images or particular "values"-important as that is. It is equally important to attend to the social variety with which such images are associated with social values. And while I fully agree with Guck's observation that "verbal descriptions of musical works are not transparent reports of their structures: they are constitutive of the works" (1990:1) it is equally the case that musicological discourse is not simply talk and writing "about music," but is also constitutive of music. In illustrating this latter point I would like to begin by applying Guck's method-a close reading of musicological writing-to her own paper. In spite of her sensitivity to mixed metaphor in musicological writing, she uses her own--or rather, musicology's own-trope of "music" to effectively set limits on her own discussion. "If we have invented a profusion of stories about the nature of music and we mix our fictional metaphors on a grand scale when we do analysis, maybe we're trying to let music be music" (1990:9, emphasis original). Her use in this sentence of passive voice (let music be) is noteworthy, for in another comment on the disparatity of imagery in musicological writing Guck suggests, "rather than thinking of it as a regrettable inconsistency or incoherence, I think it reflects a primary engagement with the music (1990:6). What can we say about a concept with which a "primary engagement" is accomplished through the same means--multiple fictions, mixed meta- phors-as that of "let[ting it] be?" Many people would simply say that this is one of the paradoxes that make music such a fascinating and elusive phenomenon. However, although traditionally understood specifically in terms of its supposedly nonverbal essence, the domain of "music" in fact appears as a product of rhetorical/discursive/verbal practice. Whether or not there is a concrete phenomenon that is at once "not representational" (Guck 1990:1) and "able to portray properties... for which we have no words" (1990:9), there certainly is a community of persons who use the word "music" in highly creative, strategic, and poetic ways. The notion of "music" is itself a multiple fiction, the product of a complex and varied discursive practice, more than it is a phenomenal, autonomous medium of nonverbal communication. As Guck herself says, "This readiness to change vocabulary... is a common practice-we all do it (1990:6)."</page><page sequence="8">202 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 The word "music" is not, by the way, being used metaphorically in these cases. For a metaphoric sense of "music" we would be better thinking of the mischievous child who will have to "face the music" when dad comes home, or the man for whom today's news is "music to his ears." On the other hand, not all figurative speech is metaphor, and the word "music" in Guck's statements has nevertheless been used in a figurative fashion. It could hardly be otherwise: the word "music" is altogether lacking a real-world object. The first thing to know about the word "music" is that it has a plethora of possible meanings, and that no one of them holds through the variety of uses. At the same time, colloquial references to "the actual music" and "the music itself' are frequently-indeed, characteristically- made with an intensity of intonation clearly connoting the fact that though situational, such uses of the word are in no way marginal. Among conservatory students, for example, there seems to be less frequent concern with whether this or that music is "good" or "bad" than with whether what she, he, or they were doing was really "music:" Social Dynamics of Conservatory Talk To move briefly from written to spoken discourse: what are conservatory students (and their teachers) talking about when they talk about music, "the actual music," the music "itself?" For the most part, they are talking about themselves, about each other, about social and musical life in the conservatory. "She doesn't play the music, she only plays the notes"; "when she sings, I feel like I'm in the presence of the music"; "this is all politics, but you can't prove it because musical decisions are being made at the same time" (Kingsbury 1988:156-63). Even among people who profess an abiding belief that music is ultimately asocial, absolute, and pure, the most intensely spoken references to "the actual music" tend to be unambiguous comments on social situations and particular persons. Perhaps I should not have begun the previous sentence with the word "even," for it seems that it is particularly people with an attachment to the idea of "absolute" music who tend to use the word "music" (or "musical") to characterize persons or social situations. In the conservatory where I did anthropological field research the shifting senses of the word "music" were occasionally indicators of a bureaucratic division of labor within the institution. For example, I attended one class that by virtue of its subject matter could only have been taught in a conservatory, although within the context of the class the topic was consistently categorized as nonmusic. This was a class entitled "Diction for Singers," a class in which voice majors are taught the phonemes of French, Latin, and German so that they will be better equipped to sing the voice repertoire written in those languages. Grammar and syntax were never at issue in these classes, and even "diction," taken in its literal sense meaning</page><page sequence="9">Sociological Factors in Musicological Poetics 223 usage, was almost never under discussion. The subject matter was pronun- ciation, pure and simple, and although there was a good deal of lip service given to the matter of knowing what the words of particular songs mean, it was clear that frequently the students did not know the meaning of the words they were singing. In other words, the class dealt not with any kind of linguistic competence, but specifically with musical performance skills. And yet, within the class it was clearly understood that the subject matter of the class belonged to the domain of nonmusic. "That's a musical question, we don't deal with that here," was the way the teacher often deflected questions dealing with topics such as tempo or melodic inflection. And in anticipation of just such a parry, students hopeful of drawing connections between what transpired in the course and their aspirations as performers would frequently preface their questions with "I know this is a musical question, but..." Moreover, lest it be thought that it was the connection, however atomized, with words that rendered the "Diction" class a class in nonmusic, very much the same caveat was occasionally heard in sightsinging class. More than once I heard the teacher in that class admonish, "these chorales are not music-they are drills." As it happens, the chorales in question were by J. S. Bach, compiled in a volume of sightsinging exercises for classroom use. The fact that the excerpts of J. S. Bach could be classified as nonmusic is a function of the fact that although "music" is quite literally a sacred notion within the conservatory, each class is organized in terms of a specific (hence secularized, mundane, practical) topical problem. In the case of the sightsinging class, although the vehicle was Bach chorales, the topic was melodic intervals and harmonic progressions. The basic point in all this is that one of the most important things that conservatory students learn in the course of their stay in the institution is a sociocultural skill in the use of verbal imagery. To be sure, conservatory students have to practice; but equally importantly, they learn a practice, that of how to use and invoke the notion of music (as well, of course, as other similarly charged notions such as talent, expression, feeling, and the like). The converse of this point holds equally: the myriad senses of the word "music" should be understood as at once the social grammar and the social poetic of a rather closely associated community, and that the various uses of the word are in fact learned in the context of interaction in and among such a community. The Sociology of Textual Interpretation: II Indeed, what is Guck saying when she suggests that through the practice of combining analytical fictions, "maybe we're trying to let music be music?" One of the implications of what she is saying is, Let's not have musical discourse get too attached to a single set of metaphoric images-that would</page><page sequence="10">204 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 be detrimentally restricting and confining, and would tend to artificially privilege certain perspectives over others. Let's leave the various Schenkers and Fortes, perhaps the Snarrenbergs and the Kingsburys, and maybe even some of the conservatory students, to continue working out among themselves the relative significance of organicism and mechanism, of passivity and agency, of permanence and transience in musical discourse. Let's leave the musical/musicological community the expressive freedom it needs to meaningfully represent the variety of musical experience. Let it be. Of course, in an equally important sense this is precisely what she has not said. She has simply said, "let music be music," and I have provided an exegesis. However, her statement, while simple, is also highly poetic. It is, moreover, the very essence of musicological myth: the idea that music is an autonomous, absolute medium of communication is, like most myths, neither true nor false, but rather a matter of faith. As I have just suggested, it is also to a considerable extent a matter of indoctrination, in that the notion of "absolute" music is a central item in the academic training and recruitment of the "serious" music community. Thus whether one reads her statement as compelling or trivial is liable to depend upon one's relationship with the musical community. A key to the complexities of the figurative diction found in musicological writing can be found in papers on the "mission" of metaphor and metonymy by anthropologists James Fernandez (1974) and Robert Paine (1981). Fernandez, in the context of a many-layered discussion of "the mission of metaphor," in effect defines metaphor as "a predication upon a subject of an object from a domain to which the subject belongs only by a stretch of the imagination" (1974:123). In a similar vein, Paine points out that metaphor "is the trope of the development and extension of thought ... it assists speakers in presenting evocative, arresting and personalized accounts" (1981:188). Fernandez calls attention to "the emotional movement accomplished by the use of the assigned metaphor... we are generally not interested in mere parallel alignment, but in adornment or disparagement" (1974:124). How- ever, he also points out that "metaphorical terms can be taken literally in ritual and made the basis of the rites. That is, metaphors are not only rhetorical devices of persuasion; they can also lead to performance" (1974:125). As such, however, the mission of metaphor is overtaken by that of metonymy: "the transformation of a metaphor... is achieved in me- tonymy--in the performance of that metaphor" (1974:127). Paine's discussion, which as it happens comes in the context of an analysis of political speechmaking, is fairly explicit regarding the strategic distinctions which can be seen separating metaphor and metonymy. Metonymy, he argues, "is based on the already-known and accepted; its structure is 'closed' and always near tautology" (Paine 1981:188). The core of Paine's argument is that in political contexts metaphor tends to be the agent of change, whereas</page><page sequence="11">Sociological Factors in Musicological Poetics 225 the first mission of metonymy is, contrary to that of metaphor, to withold the slip into change... The politician who wants to get into power does well to introduce new options ... and that is also the implication of metaphor as a leap of the imagination ... But having gained power, a politician may be expected to be concerned with the closure of all other options to his public and, given the property of metonym, this purpose would be served by drawing all within his political jurisdiction (persons and symbols, in particular) into metonymic relations (1981:189). One might at this point feel inclined to complain that Fernandez and Paine in their discussions have wandered rather widely from the strict meaning of the word "metonymy"--one dictionary definition of which is "the use of the name of one thing for that of another of which it is an attribute or with which it is associated (as in 'lands belonging to the crown')." On the other hand, by adhering closely to the dictionary definition we can perhaps see even more clearly the sociological significance of the discussions of Fernandez and Paine: both of them are pointing out that it is through the manipulation of social context-be it in ritual, in performance, or in politicking-that domains of attribution and association are modified or maintained. The discussions of Fernandez and Paine dovetail quite happily with the above discussion of musical/musicological discourse. For although mechanistic notions like "structure" and "scale" or organismic notions like "breathing" at the end of a phrase are alike in being metaphors, in musical or musicological practice their metaphoric character is frequently overlooked or forgotten. The act of calling attention to their metaphoric character thus can have the effect of replacing the appearance of inevitbility with an awareness of contingency, and of opening at least the possibility of change. Both Guck and Snarrenberg discuss this issue, and the concepts they use in so doing are themselves instructive. Guck has coined the phrase "music literal," and using a spatial metaphor ("a motive which descends stepwise") as illustration, points out that "it [the word 'descends'] amounts to a term for a particular kind of pitch succession" (1990:4, emphasis original). To this Snarrenberg adds a sociological element, glossing Guck's "music literal" as "language in which the only metaphors that are regularly used are relatively 'dead' sofaras the music theory community is concerned' (1990:8, emphasis added). Thus the distinction between words taken as metaphoric and words taken as literal (or metonymic) devolves to a distinction of interpreting communities. In this case of course, the community in question is the musicians and music theorists who, over time and through continual interaction in terms of these conceptualizations, have come to experience these images not as metaphors but as actual references to the essential phenomena: "the actual" structure, "the actual" material of the composition "itself."</page><page sequence="12">26X Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 Of course, some of the musical discourse is itself rather politicized; the conservatory student who said, "this is all politics but you can't prove it because musical decisions are being made at the same time" demonstrated clearly one way in which the notion of "music" has the effect of limiting options, if not preventing change. The "politics" in question here, of course, were of the microcosmic-bureaucratic character so endemic to institutions and corporations. However, the connections between musical and political discourse are pervasive, as will be discussed presently. Hanslick's Trope For the moment, however, it still needs to be emphasized that the notion of "absolute music" is a poetic image, and that this image is constitutive of the academic music community. Among people not concerned with "art" music, the notion often arouses only indifference or bemusement, and of course the notion has no meaning at all in the myriad cultures whose languages have no word for "music." However, within Western culture the image of "absolute" music is one with a long tradition, dating back at least to Eduard Hanslick's argument that music is incapable of expressing emotion and that music--true music-is free from associations with words or action. Hanslick held that "the term 'music,' in its true meaning, must exclude compositions in which words are set to music," and that only instrumental music "is pure and self-subsistent music" (Hanslick 195711854]: 29f.). However, the notion that musical epistemology is by nature oppositional with verbal representation (a notion which, not incidentally, pervades the writing of Charles Seeger) carries with it a considerable cultural charge. Indeed, even within Western musical history, such a notion runs afoul of the seventeenth century Florentine Camerata and its principle of expressio verborum. And for all its aura of scientism, it is important to realize that the oppositional relationship between music and speech came as much from poets as from scientists or critics. Before Hanslick came the nineteenth century French poet Alphonse de Lamartine, who held that "La musique est la litterature du coeur, elle commence l~ oCi finit la parole" (music is the literature of the heart, it begins where speech ends). From about the same period comes this from Herman Melville, a writer not usually associated with musicological formalism: "Where the deepest word ends, there music begins, with its supersensuous and all-confounding intimations" (both Lamartine and Melville are quoted in Gottschalk 1979:106). However, as a basis for methodological formalism, the notion of "pure" or "absolute" nonverbal music entails telling idiosyncrasies. For example, Hanslick held that "the essence of music is sound in motion" (1957 [18541:48) but effectively contradicted this statement by claiming that "the composition is the finished work of art, irrespective of its performance" (1957 [1854]:75).</page><page sequence="13">Sociological Factors in Musicological Poetics 207 If followed through to its logical implications, the Hanslick argument is that the work (unperformed: still and silent on the printed page) is incapable of expressing emotion-a claim which is either trivial or absurd. Nevertheless, Hanslick's articulation has been a central theme in musical discourse for a hundred and fifty years. This is clearly not because of the logical force of his argument, but because of the poetic force of his highly configured conception of music. For Hanslick has attributed to music the properties of sound ("sound in motion") while excising all traits of the sound- making ("irrespective of its performance"). Although over the years there has been all manner of scholarly commentary about whether music does or does not express emotion, feeling, or anything, there has been much less in the way of critical unpacking of the poetical notion of "music." Musicians and musicologists have continued to avail themselves of Hanslick's notions that there is in fact an "absolute" music, and that the essence of music lies in its non-verbalism. Guck's "let music be music" simply does not follow from the literary approach she had been taking to "analytical fictions." Intertextuality, grafting, and multiplicity of metaphor are implicated in virtually all writing (Culler 1982); they might even be said to contribute to what literary critic (!) Helen Vendler was referring to (not at all metaphorically, I would submit) in her book The Music of What Happens (1988). The appearance of intertextuality in musicological writing lends no weight whatever to the idea that music is by nature extra-verbal. Guck's "let music be music" is but a variant of Hanslick's-musicology's-key trope. Of course, one of the principal correlaries of Hanslick's trope is the notion that music is asocial. A concise and representative iteration of this position can be seen in Nicholas Temperley's recent commentary on the papers in Leppart and McClary's Music and Society (Temperley 1987). Re- sponding to Rose Subotnik's assumption of "an intimate relationship between music and society," Temperley argues that "it is an assumption that she should reconsider, given the extreme difficulty she and everyone else have experienced in giving it reality by convincing examples from music not associated with words or action" (1987:686f). It perhaps goes without saying that what Temperley intends by "music not associated with words or action" is instrumental compositions having no sung or spoken text, to which the composer has provided neither a literary "program" nor an evocative, non-generic composition title. Although of course a word such as "sonata" is associated with countless compositions, the fact is that in most cases a sonata would qualify under Temperley's criteria as "not associated with words" while "Night on BaldMountain" would not. Since, as should be obvious from the foregoing discussion, all music either is or comes to be associated with words or action, simply by invoking the idea of "music not associated with words or action," Temperley has quite</page><page sequence="14">2~8 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 clearly implied that some kinds of words, or rather, some people's words (and actions) count, and other people's don't. Just as Snarrenberg had noted that among the community of music theorists the metaphoric character of certain key concepts comes to be forgotten, Temperley's comment regarding music "not associated with words" demonstrates that among music theorists and musicologists, certain concepts-nay, entire discourses!--come to lose their ontological status as words. Temperley's remark regarding the supposedly asocial nature of music itself entails a fundamentally social perspective. The Sociology of Textual Interpretation: III To develop this point I would like to compare one type of "analytical" writing about supposedly "absolute" music with the "extramusical" com- mentary of a well-known program symphony. The point I want to make is that in both cases we are dealing with a poetically organized flow of metaphoric imagery, that their rhetorical similarities might even outweigh their differences, and that their differences lie in what might be called the speech communities to which they appeal. The comparison I propose involves a passage from Berlioz' program to Symphony Fantastique and another from an essay written by Donald Tovey. First, the Berlioz: The author imagines that a young musician, afflicted with that moral disease that a well-known writer calls the vague despassions, sees for the first time a woman who embodies all the charms of the ideal being he has imagined in his dreams, and he falls desperately in love with her. Through an odd whim, whenever the beloved image appears before the mind's eye of the artist it is linked with a musical thought whose character, passionate but at the same time noble and shy, he finds similar to the one he attributes to his beloved (Berlioz 1971:23). Now a snippet from Tovey, discussing the first movement of Beethoven's G Major piano concerto: Beethoven has now well and truly laid the foundations of his concerto form and is free to raise his edifice to heights undreamt of in earlier music. .. the composer's main difficulties in the classical concerto are concentrated in the opening tutti and the solo exposition of the first movement, the rest of the concerto presenting no special problems. Unless apearances have misled me (the chronology of Beethoven's opp. 53-60 being so inextricable) the volumi- nous Triple Concerto, op. 56 is the technical exercise by which Beethoven experimented with dry material in correcting the errors which he recognized in his first three concertos (Tovey 1989:61). With the Berlioz, we have a classic example of "extramusical" imagery-a story with at least a modicum of dramatic action in which personal/moral traits are associated with music. That the musician in the narrative is Berlioz himself is hardly ambiguous, even though he has been rhetorically displaced</page><page sequence="15">Sociological Factors in Musicological Poetics 29 as an imaginary third-person character. Thus we have a poetical interplay between a concrete reality (Hector Berlioz is infatuated with Harriet Smithson) and fiction (young musician hopelessly in love with marvelous woman). The reference in the narrative to a "musical thought" is associated explicitly with both the woman and the moral characteristics (passionate, noble, shy), and implicitly-but again with little ambiguity-with the idle fixe of the audible symphony. With the Tovey we have a metaphor of "form" elaborated by imagery of "foundations" and of "raising" an "edifice" to new "heights." Moreover, in reading this passage it is important to realize that Tovey was not writing a historical chronicle, but rather was engaged in a rhetorical-poetical elabo- ration of the notion of "form." Tovey's suggestion that Beethoven, after completing the first three concerti, recognized that he had made "errors" in resolving the "difficulties" encountered in their composition should be treated with radical doubt-if, that is, the Tovey passage were to be taken literally, as chronicle. A large part of my point, however, is that this is not how the passage is or should be read. Tovey certainly knew that Beethoven did occasionally return to make improvements on earlier works, that he composed the striking "middle period" cadenzas to the first movement of the B-flat and C major piano concerti. I venture to doubt that Tovey really believed that while Beethoven was working on the triple concerto he was thinking of it as a technical preparation for later works. In other words, while there is ample reason to think that Beethoven continued to have concern for and interest in his early concerti well after they were completed, I know of no chronicled evidence that Beethoven's concerns were the same as Tovey's. Tovey's historical method, if it can be called that, is not that of chronicling but of musical criticism. Writing of Beethoven's "mistake" in the C minor concerto, he states that "Beethoven seems to discover the error at the moment of committing it, with the result that its tutti executes a charmingly dramatic volte-face in mid-career, as if to say 'But no!"' (1989:47). However, Tovey also knew that Beethoven did not go back and revise the exposition section of that concerto. Thus the two appearances of the word "Beethoven" in the Tovey passage are tropologically displaced from the historical person Ludwig van Beethoven, and at least partially identified with Tovey-rather as the "young artist" in the Berlioz passage is simultaneously identified with but displaced from the historical personage, Hector Berlioz. The word "Beethoven" turns out to be a trope for Tovey! Moreover, phrases such as "the composer's main difficulties" and "errors which he recognized" rhetorically attribute to Beethoven the perception of a concern that almost certainly was not Beethoven's, but was Tovey's. Thus while Tovey's more obvious extensions of the "form" metaphor-in that they come in the "warp" of the text-are the supplementary images such as "foundation," "edifice," and "height," the far</page><page sequence="16">210 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 more significant rhetorical move is his device-in the "weft"--of projection. Through this projection, the voice of Beethoven comes to be grafted onto that of Tovey, and the composer's voice (cf. Cone 1974) linked with that of the analyst. Moreover, projections of this sort are hardly unique to Tovey; Edward Cone's discussion of this matter almost completely elides the fact that in his book "the composer's voice" gains articulation only in its association with Cone's own voice. Indeed, it seems to me that the widespread practice of rhetorically projecting the writer's into the composer's voice might be understood as the rhetorical essence of what is called musicological criticism. If so, by the same token we might understand the projection of a communal academic voice into the composition-via the trope of "structure" or "form"-as the rhetorical essence of "analysis." In sum, in the case of the Berlioz we have a text that is written by the composer of the piece, associated specifically and solely with one particular piece, but rhetorically accessible to a generalized audience. By contrast, with the Tovey we have a quotation that is written by a critic, in a rhetoric characterizing not just a specific piece but an entire repertoire, but restricted in its audience. Not incidentally, the rhetoric which characterizes this generalized repertoire for a particularized audience is, by and large, the basis of most collegiate and conservatory musical tuition. The canonized texts of music pedagogy in the colleges, universities, and conservatories abound with titles focused on form and structure-StructuralHearing (Salzer 1952), Structural Functions of Harmony (Schoenberg 1969), Musical Form and MusicalPerformance(Cone 1968). Thus my Tovey quotation draws not only on the rhetoric common to the scholarly discourse on an entire repertoire, but also on the rhetoric that informs the oral dialect of musical pedagogy, the "local talk," as it were, of conservatory performers and students. The contrast between the Tovey and the Berlioz, then, is not that one refers to things that are "extramusical" and the other refers to "the music itself," but rather that one constitutes both a linguafranca and a voice of a community of scholars, and the other draws on imagery and rhetoric with a considerably larger audience. The intellectual tradition that extends from Eduard Hanslick to Nicholas Temperley has generated a collection of tropes-"absolute music," "form," "structure," and so on, through which a social organization of academic musicians is represented in terms of a "kind" of (musical) organization, one taken to be distinct from an "other" (extramusical) kind. Putatively impersonal or "objective" notions such as "form," "structure," and "absolute music"-in what I have called the warp of musicological discourse--can be read as projections of the musical acad- emy-the weft-in much the same way that the word "Beethoven" can be read as a trope for Tovey in the above passage. The interpretation of musical texts, once again, is an element in a fundamentally social process, consisting of an ongoing practice of reading</page><page sequence="17">Sociological Factors in Musicological Poetics 211 (and writing) individuals and communities into and out of the text. The interpretation of texts is not simply a matter of active living persons decoding the inert, autonomous symbols assembled on the printed page, but a play of rhetorical tropes in the context of a social practice. At the same time, however, there is what could be called a play of social practises going on within these rhetorical tropes. Looked at in a broader political context, the play of tropes in musicological practice turns out to be supplemented by a play of practises within musical discourse. What lies at the core of musicological interpretation is not an attachment to any one tropological image--be it organicist, spatial-architectural, or Kaluli waterfalls-but rather an attachment to a fundamental sociological concern, namely the negotiated maintenance of an interpretive community. The character of this concern can readily be seen with reference to the national political arena. Specifically, the musical/musicological preoccupa- tion with urtext editions and "authenticity" in musical performance has important homologies with the legal concern with "original intent" and "strict construction" of the constitution. In both cases the issue can be seen to devolve to what Frank Kermode (1979) once called "the institutional control of interpretation." Law and Interpretation Even after the foregoing discussion it may strike some readers as incongruous that a study of Western art music should involve itself in matters of law. For one thing, there is likely to be a sentiment that such can only constitute a gratuitous politicizing of the subject matter. However, power relations and "politics" are pervasive elements of all human interaction, certainly not excluding music. Ethnomusicologists, of course, will surely remember that Paul Berliner's important study of music in Zimbabwe (Berliner 1979) concluded with a substantial discussion of "The Law of Mbira," although even here there may be a suppressed desire to respond along the lines of "ah yes, ethnomusic---don't the Shona have fascinating customs." The pertinence of legal studies to an ethnomusicological examination of what we colloquially call "classical" music can be confirmed from a variety of perspectives. For a somewhat homely example, I would submit that the legalistic aspects of musical life were hinted at by a woman whose husband had, as she told me, quit his studies in the conservatory "because he couldn't stand all those rules and regulations they put on the music in there." Similarly, in many conservatories and music departments the year-end examination for performance students is commonly referred to as the "jury." And Igor Stravinsky once said that "the secret of perfection lies above all in [the performer's] consciousness of the law imposed upon him by the work he is performing" (Stravinsky 1947:132).</page><page sequence="18">212 Etbnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 Moreover, given my present focus on the rhetorical organization of scholarly writing, it is worth noting that the grammatical and legal senses of the word "sentence" could instructively be construed as an etymological double entendre, both derived from the Latin sententia, meaning opinion, decision, or maxim. And the word "verdict," commonly thought of as being the very essence of legal decision making, derives from Latin cognates referring not to deciding or judging, but to talking: "something said truly." The interpenetration of law and language is further evidenced by the fact that a verdict-"I pronounce you innocent of the offense with which you have been charged"--is the very epitome of what philosopherJohn Austin called the "performative utterance," and that the notion of performative utterance in turn collapses the distinction between what I have been calling the warp and the weft. For the essence of the performative utterance is its absence of propositional truth or falsity, and the primacy of its modification of social relationships through the use of words. Of course, performative utterances are always subject to what Austin called "felicity conditions" in terms of which the utterances are interpreted; thus, "I pronounce you guilty" is not a true performative if spoken by a six-year-old child (Austin 1962:1-24). In another context (Kingsbury 1988:71) I noted that a statement such as "your child is very talented" approximates a performative utterance if it is made by a person whose musical esteem is acknowledged as sufficient to make the statement. What remains to be said is simply that a great deal of everyday talk within the conservatory could be construed as an ongoing negotiation of the professional esteem within the musical community, of negotiating the performative "felicity" of authoritative utterances (Who says she's talented? What does he know about music, anyway?). Having established, as I hope I have, the all-pervasiveness of concerns for social power in musical and musicological discourse, I would conclude my case (!) for the musicological significance of legal studies with the suggestion that law is in essence the institution for the verbal formalization of social power relations-indeed, it seems to me that such might even be taken as the basis of a definition of law. And it is hardly insignificant that at present there is in the area of legal studies a wide body of scholarship linking the domains of law and literature. For example, in an article entitled "Law as Literature," Sanford Levinson notes that "the disputes currently raging through literary criticism precisely mirror some of the central problems facing anyone who would take law seriously; the basis of this paralellism is the centrality to law of textual analysis." (Levinson &amp; Mailloux 1988:157). In my conservatory research I not only found a ubiquitous concern for social power, but also noticed many times that musical and musicological texts were invoked as supra-legal documents: "You can't play that way, your version of the score is not the original; the original edition says staccato." It</page><page sequence="19">Sociological Factors in Musicological Poetics 213 was this observation which first suggested to me an interpenetration of music and law, linking musicians' concern for urtext editions or historical "au- thenticity" with what lawyers know as the "doctrine of original intent." The nature of the parallels among music, literature, and law can be seen in Frank Kermode's article "The Institutional Control of Interpretation" (1979). Kermode notes that within the literary academy there are periodic rebellions over which authors deserve to be included in the Canon, and, in turn, over what kinds of reading and writing are deserving of what Kermode terms the "license to exegesis." Kermode does not flinch from pointing out that decisions on such matters are made through academic appointments, tenures, promotions, and salary raises-that is to say, in terms of coercive decisions pertaining to material conditions-just the kind of interpretive decisions that might be thought to distinguish "legal" from aesthetic inter- pretation. An observation on a turn-of-the-century edition of Chopin may help to illustrate the institutional control of contemporary musical interpretation. Rose Subotnik notes that she was "astonished" to read Arthur Friedheim's justification of his editorial modifications of Chopin's texts. While Friedheim says he had no thought of improving on Chopin's markings, he had with his own ears heard performances of Chopin by both Liszt and Anton Rubinstein, and wanting to "preserve the 'tradition at second-hand' that he had in his mind's ear ... used the markings which were most likely to get that rendition from the modem performer" (Subotnik 1987:111). Subotnik's astonishment, of course, stems from the fact that editorial modifications of musical texts are nowadays considered to be vulgar pollutions of the "actual" compositions. Friedheim's striking claim to an equally authentic concern for performance tradition provides a reminder of an all but forgotten alternative to the interpretive hegemory of the contemporary musical academy. Friedheim's editing was clearly an attempt to facilitate musical interpretation in an epoch when the musical community was populated more by lay amateurs and less by institutionally trained specialists. Kermode's discussion of institutional control of interpretation provides a near-perfect example of what Levinson (1979) once characterized as a "Catholic"-as versus "Protestant"-model of textual interpretation. Levinson's model harks to the Protestant Reformation, when interpretation of the scriptures, recently distributed in common-language translations, was no longer the sole domain of an exegetically-trained priesthood. Levinson's "Catholic" model of interpretation, then, is one characterized by a high degree of hegemony of highly-trained interpretive specialists, whether these be Supreme Court Justices, literature professors, conservatory pedagogues, or eccliastics. To me it seems inescapable that the twentieth-century movement toward an insistence on "urtext" editions, historically "authentic"</page><page sequence="20">214 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 performance, and the adherence to the composers' intentions has taken place in the context of a progression toward a "Catholic"-that is, institu- tionally-controlled--environment of musical interpretation. Of course, the matter of whether or not contemporary performances can or should be historically "authentic" is under rather hot debate at the present moment, and to me it is just this controversy that suggests most strikingly certain homologies between music and law. For example, in spite of all the urgency that has lately been given to the idea of historical authenticity, musicologist Richard Taruskin has recently put forth an energetic argument that historicist rationalizations regarding "authenticity" in early-music per- formance are for the most part specious prevarications, ex post facto rationalizations for a performance style that is in fact thoroughly modern (Taruskin 1988). Much the same argument is made by law historian Leonard Levy, who in a recent book on Constitutional interpretation argues that "the [Supreme] Court has invoked the authority or intent of the Framers whenever it suited the Justices." Just as musicologist Taruskin chides the pseudohistory of "authentistic" performers of "early music," law historian Levy castigates what he calls the judicial "twistory" and the "historical illiteracy of the Supreme Court" (Levy 1988:320), trained as they are as lawyers rather than as historians. On the related yet distinct question of whether adherence to original intention is even possible, Levy argues that "original intent is an unreliable concept because it assumes the existence of one intent on a particular issue," something that is, he insists, patently not the case. Making very much the same argument, Taruskin holds that "composers do not usually have intentions such as we would like to ascertain." As evidence, Taruskin cites a series of strikingly discrepant performances of Le Sacre de Printemps, all conducted by Stravinsky (Taruskin 1988:145f), the same Stravinsky who, significantly, railed more stridently than perhaps any on the matter of obedience to the composer's intentions. It was Stravinsky, after all, who is reported to have said "I do not want my music to be interpreted, I want it to be played." I insist it is without changing the subject that I point out that it was Edwin Meese who said "a Supreme Court must give deference to what the Constitution ... may demand," and that it was Robert Bork who insisted that Justices who do anything else will be "enforcing their own morality on the rest of us and calling it the Constitution" (both quoted in Levy 1988: xii-xiii). Just as Stravinsky insists that "the composer's will is explicit and easily discernible from a correctly established text" (1947:127), Meese insists that "the point is, the meaning of the Constitution can be known" (quoted in Levinson and Mailloux 1988:27) and that the duty of contemporary lawyers and judges is to act in accordance with that meaning. Historians such as</page><page sequence="21">Sociological Factors in Musicological Poetics 215 Taruskin and Levy can and will fulminate to the contrary, and they will convince many, including myself. They will not, however, prevail in any ultimate way, for whether in music or in law, historians and historicists talk at cross-purposes. And in a recent issue of the Journal of the American Musicological Society, none other than Richard Taruskin has invoked the intentions of the composer in support of his argument regarding a matter of fifteenth-century mensural notation (Taruskin 1989:444). Taruskin also makes a distinction between musicians who construe the composers' intentions "in spiritual, metaphysical, or emotional terms" and those whose concerns are with "empirically ascertainable... facts." His exemplar of the former is Landowska, whose zeal to honor the composers' intentions was focused on the "spiritual content" and the proper "emotional effect" of the compositions; his exemplar of the latter is Christopher Hogwood, for whom (at least in Taruskin's account) a zealous fidelity to the letter of the text is the ideal. I submit that here, too, Taruskin is invoking the same criteria as a legal scholar, this time James Boyd White, in a discussion of opposing opinions written in the case of Olmstead vs. United States (see Levinson and Mailloux 1988:393-410). The issue in Olmstead was whether or not the Fourth Amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures was germane to a case of a wiretap placed on a defendant's phone without search warrant. Of course, the Fourth Amendment was written a good while before the activities of Alexander Graham Bell, and phone taps are not discussed in the Constitution. Justice Taft's majority opinion in Olmstead was based on what White characterizes as a "literalist" interpretation-Taft wrote that "The Amendment shows that the search is to be of material things-the person, the house, his papers, or his effects"; in the phone tap there was, in Taft's literal sense, no search, and no seizure. By contrast, Justice Brandeis' minority opinion stressed that the Constitution is made "not merely by the Framers but by those who read the Framers well, who translate-'carry over'-its terms to the contemporary world" (White 1988:407f). Not surprisingly, he argued that the Fourth Amendment should apply to taps placed on the newfangled telephones. Brandeis saw the Constitution more in terms of "a vision of human culture working over time" (White 1988:4070, and his approach to textual interpretation seems consonant with that of Landowska, who said, "little do I care if, to attain the proper effect, I use means that were not exactly those available to Bach" (Landowska 1964:356). At least one political scientist, Lief Carter, has quite directly argued that the theory of performance and esthetics is precisely what is needed to understand the workings of contemporary U. S. jurispridence: The Supreme Court from Marbury vs. Madison forward has never consistently practiced the conventional techniques of justification. Therefore, the conven-</page><page sequence="22">216 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 tional theory, even if theoretically achievable, cannot provide either a viable descriptive model or a plausible set of political norms for evaluating the Court's work" (Carter 1984: 274). Carter repeatedly states that "the court does not interpret the constitution," that it "does not follow, interpret, or discover legal rules and principles. It does something else" (1984:275, 277). What it does, in Carter's view, is perform: "Courts are theaters on whose stages judges perform" (1984:285): If we asked nine actors to prepare a character, a "persona," and then to maintain it throughout an extended improvisation, we might then observe on the "stage" much collective nonsense and much consistency of individual characterization all at once. This is, I think, a plausible description of the modern Court. Neither rules and precedents nor viable constitutional theories seem to cause results. They are instead tools by which individual Justices justify their visions. Each Justice seeks consistency with his or her jurisprudential "position" (1984:291). In this, Carter is making an argument not unlike that of Levy: both of them are calling attention to the disjunction between the court's behavior and the text of the Constitution or subsequent legislation. However, Carter has gone a large step further and recommended an alternative paradigm for the study of American jurisprudence. His model is Wagner's DieMeistersinger, whose hero, Walther, triumphs in the singing competition in large part because his naive ignorance of the formalisms of music was, in performance, manifested as the transcendence of the stultifying aspects of formal stricture and as a renegotiating of the social order. In other words, political scientist Carter has turned to aesthetic theory for a solution to the limitations of traditional legal scholarship, pointing to the role of esthetic performance in meeting the "demand for normative coherence and closure" (1984:287). For Carter, the core of jurisprudence is not the Constitution, laws, rules, or "interpreta- tion"-but persuasion. Discussing the difference between the "great" and the "mediocre" justices-about which there is a fair degree of consensus--Carter notes "I suspect the greats become so by persuading us that they possess a coherent view of community. Significantly, they tend also to have been great writers, that is, great performers... Marshall, Holmes, Cardozo, Brandeis, Frankfurter, and Jackson are better known for the poetic force of their opinions than are Lurton, Butler, and Blackmun" (1984:290f). Carter, in short, has turned to aesthetics as an approach to this fundamentally law-governed political process. To this my response is that the converse seems equally appropriate. The nearly incessant controversies among conservatory musicians over whether a performer is truly "musical" or "unmusical" are negotiated in terms of criteria having unmistakable homologies in law. The conservatories of the land, in a word, are filled with conflicts between latter day Walthers and Beckmessers, and performances of "classical" music are constantly evalu- ated in terms of the very same principles through which courts of law enforce</page><page sequence="23">Sociological Factors in Musicological Poetics 217 social order: adherence to the "letter" of the text, adherence to the "spirit" of the text, and supposed adherence to the "intention" of the text's author(s). The texts themselves, of course-whether the U. S. Constitution or Beethoven's Sonata opus 111--are passive resources that can only be invoked situationally by parties to the action, characteristically in justification of their own actions. Thus they are inescapably social and political, not merely "musical." Coda I am reminded by my dictionary that the etymology of the word "text" leads through the sense of "thing woven." I hope that in the foregoing discussion I have expanded the notion of what gets woven into the fabric of musicological and music-theoretical texts. Musicological texts do indeed weave different fictions, as Guck noted, but also and at the same time they weave a wide but subtle variety of individuals and social groups. Many of these metaphoric "fictions" turn out on inspection to be rhetorical projec- tions of various social actors. The "young artist" in Berlioz' program represents Berlioz himself, just as Tovey's use of the word "Beethoven" strikingly represents Tovey; the authoritative music-analytical community is represented in images pertaining to musical "structure" and is shown deference by the taboo on editorial insertions into the scores of musical masterworks. An appeal to a more generalized musical 'laity' is indicated by Freidheim's editorial insertions into Chopin's compositions, and also by the narrative character of a Berlioz program. The interpretation of texts is rarely simply interpretation. It frequently entails elements of enactment or rendition, but equally frequently consists more of textual invocation in the context of ongoing social negotiation. In all of these cases what is crucial is the link connecting textual interpretation to social organization, the rhetorical links connecting the fictions of the text with the social facts-and perhaps the factions--of the interpreting institutions.
