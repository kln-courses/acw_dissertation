Abstract. The parenchyma of flatworms consists of a variety of mesenchymal cell types embedded in their associated extracellular matrices (ECM). As acoelomates, the flatworms are defined partially by this parenchyma; yet, it has not been studied as much as this fact warrants. From the limited data available, the parenchyma cells are known to include myocytes and neoblasts, as well as numerous types of specialized cells, most of which have unknown functions. The cells often are attached to each other and to their neighboring epithelial cells and ECM by intercellular junctions, most of which are gap junctions and hemidesmosomes. Flatworm ECM may be divided generally into basal and interstitial matrices, but there is considerable overlap and variation within and between the two. Substantial structural diversity exists among parenchyma cells and ECM in different species, developmental stages, and anatomical regions. Some of this diversity has apparent phy- logenetic significance, but comparative data from which to draw many meaningful con- clusions are too few. Depending on the species, parenchyma may function in providing skeletal support, nutrient storage, motility, reserves of regenerative cells, transport of materials, structural interactions with other tissues, modifiable tissue for morphogenesis, oxygen storage, and perhaps other functions that have yet to be determined. One of the most conspicuous morphological characteristics of flatworms is their acoelomate body. Basically, the acoelomate condition entails the absence of a body cavity, with all internal organs separated from the body wall by mesenchymal tissue known as parenchyma. By definition as a mesenchymal tissue, this continuous parenchyma consists of various types of cells embedded in their associated extracellular matrices (ECM). For many years, most comparative zoologists have regarded the acoelomate condition as having important phylogenetic and/or ontogenetic implications (Conn, 1991), although recent studies have argued for critical reevaluation of previously held views (Rieger, 1980, 1985; Smith et al., 1986; Turbeville, 1986). 1 Based on an updated version of a paper presented at the symposium entitled "Biology of the Flatworms," sponsored by the American Microscopical Society and convened 29 December 1991 in Atlanta, Georgia.

Flatworms (phylum Platyhelminthes) constitute by far the largest group of primary acoelomates (i.e., animals in which the acoelomate condition is not ontogenetically derived from a coelomate condition). Smaller acoelomate taxa whose parenchymal systems have been studied in some detail include the Nemertinea (Turbeville, 1991; Turbeville &amp; Ruppert, 1985) and the Xenotur- bellida (Pedersen &amp; Pedersen, 1986). Numerous studies published over the past few decades have examined the histological and ultrastructural features of flatworm parenchyma. Rieger et al. (1991a) provided a comprehensive review of turbellarian structure that included detailed information on turbellarian parenchyma. Recent reviews on the struc- ture of digeneans, monogeneans, aspidogastreans (Fried &amp; Haseeb, 1991), and cestodes (Coil, 1991) have provided more cursory perspectives of parenchyma in those groups. However, all of these reviews have been directed only at their respective flatworm groups; no integrative review comparing parenchymal systems among all flatworms has appeared. The present review was prepared in an attempt to identify major themes of unity and diversity within the parenchymal systems of Platyhelminthes as a phylum. As such, the information was compiled and synthesized in such a way as to permit comparisons among major flatworm taxa as well as with other phyla. WHAT IS PARENCHYMA? The term parenchyma is used by different authors in reference to a variety of tissues or body regions, thus making the term ambiguous. In this review, parenchyma will be used in reference to all of the solid mesenchymal tissue occurring between the various epithelial (e.g., integumentary, reproductive, digestive, excretory) and neural tissues of a flatworm (Figs. 1, 2). So defined, parenchyma has been regarded by various authors as either a type of tissue or a body region. However, the early light microscopists' practice of regarding the parenchyma as a body region should be discontinued, inasmuch as this "parenchymal region" in many flatworms contains not just parenchyma cells but also the nucleated cytons of overlying epithelia (Rieger, 1981). This type of "sunken epithelium" occurs in many flatworm taxa (Lumsden &amp; Hildreth, 1983; Smyth &amp; Halton, 1983; Tyler, 1984). The true parenchyma tissue includes a number of different types of mesenchymal cells and ECM. Given the definition enunciated above, myocytes (i.e., muscle cells including their various processes) are included as one type of parenchyma cell. This stands in contrast to the treatment by many (perhaps most) authors who have tradi- (M), secretory myocytons (S), and storage myocytons (St) embedded in a voluminous interstitial matrix (I). Fig. 2. A mature proglottid of Mesocestoides lineatus showing the relationship between the medullary parenchyma and various ducts (D). Parenchyma cell components include myofibrils (M), secretory myocytons (S), and storage myocytons (St) embedded in a fibril-rich interstitial matrix (I), which also serves as a basal matrix for the excretory (E) and reproductive (Re) duct epithelia. 243</page><page sequence="4">TRANS.

I would argue, however, that to regard myocytes as a distinct category of cells reflects a somewhat anthropomorphic convention that has become obsolete in light of more recent data on comparative functional morphology. To identify any unifying and distinctive characteristic of all myocytes throughout the animal kingdom is difficult, except for their possession of contractile myofilaments. The contractile activity of myocytes may be employed for many functions other than loco- motion. Examples include myocytes that are used entirely for tubular constric- tion or thermoregulation (e.g., in insects and vertebrates). Furthermore, my- ocytes are highly heterogeneous in their non-contractile functions, which range from ion regulation to glycogen storage to fibroblastic activity, depending on the animal species and the type of myocyte (]Ross &amp; Klebanoff, 1971). Another important point is that not all cells containing myofilaments are mesenchymal, a point that Rieger &amp; Lombardi (1987) suggested might have important phy- logenetic implications. Examples include the cliploblastic cnidarians that possess epitheliomuscular cells (Thomas &amp; Edwards, 1991) and the triploblastic echi- noderms whose coelomic linings are a myoepithelium (Shinn et al., 1990). Finally, we should not assume that contractility is the primary function of all cells that possess myofilaments; certainly this is not the case for many cnidarian epithelial cells nor perhaps even for some flatworm parenchyma cells (see below). Thus, the term myocyte should refer simply to the fact that a cell contains myofilaments, regardless of whether that cell is part of an epithe- lium or part of the parenchyma. In flatworms, there is no discrete "muscular system." Rather, the myocytes of flatworms make up one component of the parenchyma and function in motility as well as in other essential non-contractile activities. PARENCHYMA CELLS Parenchyma cells of flatworms may be categorized into three types, namely (1) myocytes, (2) neoblasts, and (3) miscellaneous specialized cells. Myocytes. Much of the cellular volume in the parenchyma of most flatworms consists of myocytes (Figs. 1-5). In cestodes, the myocytes make up so much of the parenchyma's volume that the term "'musculoparenchyma" has been used by some authors to describe this feature (Conn &amp; Rocco, 1989; Lumsden mitochondria (Mi), and adjacent storage cyton (St). Note the absence of dilated endoplasmic reticulum and interstitial matrix. Also note that the perinuclear cytoplasm is adjacent to the myofibril (M) rather than joined through a thin internuncial process. This type of myocyte is the most common type in triclad turbellarians. Fig. 5. Storage myocytons conjoined by a gap junction (G) in a gravid proglottid of M. lineatus.

For flatworms in general, most of these myocytes constitute fully formed muscles. However, they also may include undifferentiated myo- blasts, particularly in the regeneration blastemas of planarians (Hori, 1983a,b). Fully formed myocytes are usually divided into two parts, one with the con- tractile myofibrils and the other constituting the nucleated myocyton. The degree to which the myocyton is separated from the myofibril varies among species. The limited data available indicate that triclad turbellarians usually have a broad cytoplasmic region joining myocytons to myofibrils (Hay &amp; Cow- ard, 1975; Morita, 1965). Among the cestodes, some species such as Oochoristica anolis (Fig. 4) and the lycophora larvae of Gyrocotyle urna have similarly broad cytoplasmic regions conjoining myocytons to myofibrils (Conn &amp; Etges, 1984; Xylander, 1987), whereas other species such as Mesocestoides lineatus (Fig. 3), Ophiotaenia loennbergii, and Hymenolepis diminuta have myocytons separated from the myofibrils by thin cytoplasmic internuncial processes (Conn, 1988a; Conn &amp; Rocco, 1989; Lumsden &amp; Hildreth, 1983). Unfortunately, little detailed comparative work has been done on the myocytes of other flatworm groups. Accordingly, we are not able to formulate general conclusions regarding the taxonomic significance of such variations in myocyte structure. Among the flatworm species studied to date, there occur three types of myocytons; i.e., (1) secretory, (2) storage, and (3) secretory/storage. In secretory myocytons, the perinuclear cytoplasm contains ribosomes, granular endoplas- mic reticulum (GER) and other organelles involved in protein synthesis and secretion (Figs. 2-4). Perhaps these cells are involved primarily in the produc- tion of at least some ECM components, acting as myofibroblasts (Conn &amp; Rocco, 1989; Hori, 1980; Lumsden et al., 1982; Pedersen, 1972, 1991; Threadgold &amp; Gallagher, 1966), but this has yet to be demonstrated conclusively. The degree to which the myocyton's GER is dilated varies considerably between different species and different developmental stages of the same species (Lumsden &amp; Hildreth, 1983; Pedersen, 1983). Conn (1988a) argued that these variations might be attributable to the degree to which the cells are engaged in fibroblastic activity (i.e., synthesis of ECM fibrils). For example, in some species or stages with relatively small amounts of interstitial ECM, the myocyton's endomem- brane system is reduced (Conn &amp; Etges, 1984; Pedersen, 1983), relative to that of species having voluminous interstitial ECM (Conn, 1988a; Conn &amp; Rocco, 1989). Similar variations are reported for the muscle cells (Ross &amp; Klebanoff, 1971) and fibroblasts (Ashhurst, 1968) of species from other phyla. The cytoplasm of storage and secretory/storage myocytons contains sub- stantial stores of glycogen in all flatworms that have been examined (Figs. 2, 5); most also contain lipid droplets. These areas of lipid and glycogen-rich cytoplasm often make up a large percentage of the parenchyma's volume, especially among the tapeworms, in which glycogen metabolism has been regarded as a primary function of parenchyma for many years (Lumsden, 1966; Smyth &amp; McManus, 1989). Conversely, monogeneans store rather small amounts of glycogen in the parenchyma (Halton, 1967), and there are numerous levels of glycogen storage between these extremes in other flatworm groups. Most flatworm species possess secretory/storage myocytons in which the glycogen 246</page><page sequence="7">VOL. 112, NO. 4, OCTOBER 1993 and lipid stores are contained within discrete cytoplasmic regions of the same myocytons that possess the secretory organelles described above (Hildreth &amp; Lumsden, 1987; Pedersen, 1983). However, Reissig &amp; Colucci (1968) reported that the glycogen-rich cytoplasm in myocytes of H. diminuta occurred in anu- cleated sacs that were segregated from the nucleated secretory mycocytons in separate extensions from the myofibril; Conn &amp; Rocco (1989) reported a similar situation for the proteocephalid cestode 0. loennbergii; Conn (1988a) reported that the tapeworm M. lineatus possesses nucleated storage myocytons that are entirely separate from the secretory myocytons. MacRae (1965) described a similar discrete secretory myocyton in the polyclad Notoplana acticola but reported glycogen stores only within the myofibril itself. Conn &amp; Etges (1984) and Conn &amp; Rocco (1989) discussed interspecific variation in the relative amounts of glycogen and lipid in the myocytons of cestodes as well as the tremendous interspecific variation in myocyton shape. However, as is unfortunately the case with other aspects of interspecific variation in flatworm parenchyma, too little comparative work has been done on these features to allow meaningful conclusions to be drawn. Neoblasts. Various types of generative cells also are found in flatworm pa- renchyma. Most prominent among these are the genital Anlagen that occur in various developmental stages of most species. However, the genital Anlagen develop into epithelial organs and gametes, and usually are considered in treatments of the reproductive systems; they will not be discussed here. The generative cells of flatworms that may be considered true components of the parenchyma are the neoblasts. Generally, these cells are considered to be un- differentiated or partially differentiated pluripotent stem cells that are held in reserve for wound healing (reparative regeneration), asexual reproduction, or seasonal organ replacement (physiological regeneration) (Gremigni, 1988; Palmberg, 1990, 1991). After many years of controversy as to whether or not neoblasts truly exist, most recent evidence suggests that they do occur in many turbellarians (Baguiina et al., 1989; Hay &amp; Coward, 1975) and in juvenile cestodes (metacestodes) (Wikgren &amp; Gustafsson, 1971; Wikgren &amp; Knuts, 1970), but not in adult cestodes and digeneans (Allen &amp; Nollen, 1991). The ultrastructure of turbellarian neoblasts was reviewed by Morita &amp; Best (1984). Apparently, these cells are able to differentiate into myoblasts (Hori, 1983a) as well as into epi- thelial and other cell types (Hori, 1983b). Miscellaneous specialized cells. Numerous other types of parenchyma cells have been described from flatworms, including cestodes (Rohde &amp; Garlick, 1985), digeneans (Fried &amp; Haseeb, 1991), and several turbellarian groups (Rie- ger, 1981). Rieger et al. (1991a) provided an extensive review of turbellarian parenchyma cells; aside from stem cells, they grouped "true parenchymal cells" roughly into three categories, namely (1) large ramified "fixed parenchymal cells," (2) vacuolated "chordoid cells," and (3) granular, presumably pigment, cells. The various types of specialized parenchyma cells in all of the platyhel- minth groups generally are known only from ultrastructural descriptions, with little or no information available relative to their functions. An interesting type of parenchyma cell found only in cestodes, especially 247</page><page sequence="8">TRANS. AM. MICROSC. SOC. metacestodes, is the calcareous corpuscle cell (Fig. 6). Because they are so characteristic of cestodes, these cells have received considerable attention for many years, but their functions have not been demonstrated conclusively (Smyth &amp; McManus, 1989). Each cell contains a large calcareous concretion within a vacuole that occupies most of the cell's volume when fully formed (Hess, 1980; Nieland &amp; von Brand, 1969). Working with the tetraphyllidean Trilocularia acanthiaevulgaris, McCullough &amp; Fairweather (1987) demonstrated that these cells begin as small rod-shaped parenchyma cells that gradually incorporate organic and inorganic components into the corpuscle. Perhaps the cells of the lymphatic system of certain digeneans (Brennan et al., 1992; Dunn et al., 1985; Strong &amp; Bogitsh, 1973) also may be considered a type of parenchyma cell, but little is known about their mode of formation (Fried &amp; Haseeb, 1991). Special parenchyma cells known as "juxta-lymphatic cells" have been reported to occur in conjunction with the lymphatic system of at least one digenean (Brennan et al., 1992). According to Smith (1981), the digestive or "central parenchyma" of acoel turbellarians (Pedersen, 1964) is probably more accu- rately regarded as a derivative of endodermal epithelium and is thus not com- parable to true parenchymal systems. Quite likely, additional structural and functional cell types will be discovered as more research emphasis is placed on flatworm parenchyma in the future. In general, neodermatans (i.e., cestodes, monogeneans, aspidogastreans, and digeneans) seem to have a lower diversity of parenchyma cell types than do the turbellarians. This may be attributable, in part, to the fact that the former groups, being parasitic, encounter a more uniform set of environmental con- ditions than do the turbellarians as a group. However, caution should be used in making assumptions based on existing data. For example, most previous studies of cestode parenchyma have examined only the adult strobila, the cells of which have reached terminal developmental determination for the most part. With respect to parenchyma, metacestode stages (Wikgren &amp; Gustaffson, 1971; Wikgren &amp; Knuts, 1970) or the region from the scolex to the neck of adults (Gustafsson, 1976) may be developmentally and structurally comparable to entire adult turbellarians, and therefore might provide a better basis for comparing these groups. INTERCELLULAR JUNCTIONS Many of the cells of flatworms are connected physically and/or electro- chemically to each other or the ECM through intercellular junctions of four major categories: (1) gap junctions, (2) hemidesmosomes, (3) septate junctions, and (4) desmosomes. Only gap junctions and hemidesmosomes occur commonly in the parenchyma. Adjacent myocytons are frequently conjoined by gap junc- tions (Conn, 1988a; Conn &amp; Rocco, 1989; Richards &amp; Arme, 1983; Rieger et al., 1991b; Threadgold &amp; Gallagher, 1966; Threadgold &amp; Read, 1970). These junctions usually are found conjoining the plasma membranes of storage and secretory/storage myocytons (Fig. 5); secretory myocytons and the plasma membrane surrounding myofibrils are not joined as frequently by junctions. Gap junctions also join various cells in the parenchyma to epithelial cells (Ben- 248</page><page sequence="9">VOL. 112, NO. 4, OCTOBER 1993 nett, 1977; Gallagher &amp; Threadgold, 1967; Lindroos, 1984; Quick &amp; Johnson, 1977). However, epithelia are more frequently joined to the parenchyma tissue indirectly by hemidesmosomes (Figs. 8, 9) that provide attachment to the ECM rather than to parenchyma cells (Lindroos &amp; Reuter, 1991; Lumsden &amp; Hildreth, 1983; Rieger et al., 1991a,b). In cestodes, the basal ECM of the tegument is modified as dense fibrillar strands that provide indirect attachment of the tegumental hemidesmosomes to underlying myocytes (Holy &amp; Oaks, 1987). Septate junctions (sometimes incorrectly called septate desmosomes) also occur in most flatworms, but usually conjoin adjacent epithelial cells or epi- dermal sensory cells (Rieger et al., 1991a; Tyler, 1984). In most cases, septate junctions probably function as occluding junctions, a role often performed by tight junctions in other phyla (Green &amp; Bergquist, 1982). True desmosomes (maculae and zonulae adhaerentes) are rather unusual among the flatworms, occurring primarily between adjacent epidermal cells of turbellarians (Rieger et al., 1991a). Among the cestodes, which have syncytial epithelia, desmosomes have been demonstrated clearly only in Mesocestoides lineatus, wherein they occur between embryonic envelope cells (Conn, 1988b; Conn et al., 1984), but not in the parenchyma (Conn, 1988a). EXTRACELLULAR MATRICES (ECM) For many years, investigators have recognized that cells and the ECM with which they are associated must be regarded as a single functional and devel- opmental unit (Ettensohn, 1985; Trelstad, 1984; Trinkaus, 1984). However, despite the fact that the amount of ECM research has grown tremendously in recent years, few investigators have studied flatworm ECM specifically. Peder- sen (1961, 1964, 1966, 1972, 1983, 1991) has provided most of the initiative in this field over the past few decades, concentrating primarily on descriptive ultrastructural studies of turbellarians. More recently, Lindroos (1984, 1991), Lindroos &amp; Still (1988, 1990), and Lindroos &amp; Wikgren (1987) have combined ultrastructural, cytochemical, and immunochemical techniques to develop a better perspective of structural and chemical characteristics of ECM in tur- bellarians and cestodes. Other than this, most of what we know about flatworm ECM has come from studies on the general ultrastructure of specific flatworms, or from isolated studies by workers whose focus has not been on ECM specifically (e.g., see Thomas, 1983). Conn &amp; Rocco (1989) briefly reviewed and outlined the variations in cestode ECM, and Rieger et al. (1991a) did the same for turbellarians. Pedersen (1991) provided an extensive review of the literature on the ECM of numerous invertebrate phyla, including all major flatworm groups. From the limited data that have emerged, flatworm ECM appears to comprise an array of dynamic and structurally diverse units. These units may or may not be functionally and/or structurally interconnected, depending on the species, life-cycle stage, and organ system involved. Flatworm ECM may be divided generally into two broad categories based on their spatial relationships with associated cells: (1) basal matrices (Figs. 7- 9), which provide the basal foundation for various epithelia, occurring between the epithelia and the underlying mesenchymal tissues, and (2) interstitial ma- trices (Figs. 1-3, 5, 6, 9), which occur between the mesenchymal cells.

In cestodes, for example, the functional basal matrices of the uterine and excretory epithelia are structurally continuous with and ultrastructurally indistinguishable from the interstitial matrix (Conn, 1987, 1988a; Conn &amp; Rocco, 1989). The same is true of the subepidermal matrix of some turbellarians (Rieger et al., 1991a). The so-called basal matrix of cestode acetabula (Fig. 9) is actually a specialized interstitial matrix inasmuch as it separates two mesenchymal regions from each other and does not touch any epithelium. Even in flatworms with distinct interstitial and basal matrices, the lamina fibroreticularis of the latter may extend around myocytes within the interstitial region (Pedersen, 1966, 1983, 1991); this feature is characteristic of many other phyla (Hay, 1984). There is considerable variation in the structure of both basal and interstitial matrices among flatworm species and among various developmental stages or anatomical regions of the same species. In cestodes, such variations in ECM structure do not seem to reflect distinctions among higher taxonomic groupings, but simply among species, regardless of their higher taxonomic affinities (Conn &amp; Rocco, 1989). This is less true of the turbellarians, in which different orders often have distinctive ECM features (Pedersen, 1991; Rieger, 1981; Rieger et al., 1991a). In special cases, certain basal matrix components may form spe- cialized structures not normally associated with the ECM; an example has been reported in the formation of proboscis hooks in some kalyptorhynch turbellar- ians (Doe, 1976; Rieger &amp; Doe, 1975). Unfortunately, insufficient comparative work has been done on the ECM of monogeneans, digeneans, and aspidogas- treans to determine the nature of variations in and among those groups. Variations in ECM among different stages in the life cycle of specific flat- worms are seen most clearly among the cestodes. This is particularly true for those cyclophyllidean cestodes that have a cysticercoid metacestode (juvenile) stage, in which the scolex is enclosed in a thick capsule (Lumsden et al., 1982). Perhaps the capsular ECM of cysticercoids comprises interstitial ECM, basal ECM, or a combination of the two, but this has not been elucidated. The ultrastructure of the cysticercoid capsule has been described for Hymenolepis diminuta by Allison et al. (1972), Ubelaker (1980), and Ubelaker et al. (1970) and for Hymenolepis microstoma, Hymenolepis nana, and Moniezia expansa by Caley (1974, 1975, 1976). In all cases, the ECM volume is very large in relation to cell volume, and the ECM includes an abundance of densely packed fibrils (Fig. 10). Similar variations in cell/ECM ratio and the ratio of fibrillar to amorphous components of ECM also exist in different anatomical regions of adult tapeworms (Conn &amp; Rocco, 1989; Lindroos, 1984), but generally are not as extreme. acetabulum to the medullary parenchyma in an adult scolex of 0. anolis.

ECM, therefore, may be categorized on the basis of cell relationships and ultrastructural characteristics. However, the biochemical characteristics of ECM components provide another means of comparing ECM types. The ECM of Dugesia japonica, Polycelis nigra, and Microstomum lineare (Turbellaria) and adult Diphyllobothrium dendriticum (Cestoda) have been shown to contain collagen type IV, fibronectin, and laminin fibrillar components (Hori, 1992a; Lindroos &amp; Still, 1988, 1990; Lindroos &amp; Wikgren, 1987). Other collagenous or procollagenous proteins have been identified in the turbellarian Dugesia japonica by Hori (1980) and in the cysticercus stage of the cestode Taenia solium by Torre-Blanco &amp; Toledo (1981). The putative oxytalan fibers reported from ultrastructural studies on the tegumental basal ECM of the digenean Schistosoma mansoni have not been identified chemically (Kohn et al., 1979). Biochemical analyses of the amorphous components of flatworm ECM are wanting, but limited cytochemical and autoradiographic studies have identified glycosaminoglycans in the ECM of some turbellarians (Hori, 1980; Lindroos &amp; Still, 1988). Taken together, these studies, though limited, suggest that flatworm ECM is chemically similar to that of other animal phyla; this is not surprising, given the general evolutionary conservatism of ECM components (Pedersen, 1991; Trelstad, 1984). FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS OF PARENCHYMA The structural heterogeneity of flatworm parenchyma described above is matched by an equal variety of functional properties. More than simply a packing material or connective tissue, the parenchyma performs many vital functions. The current state of knowledge regarding functional aspects of flat- worm parenchyma is far from complete. Undoubtedly, future studies will reveal a broad range of parenchymal functions among the flatworms, but several already have been suggested or demonstrated. Skeletal support. Perhaps the first function suggested for flatworm paren- chyma was that of providing some form of skeletal support. The classical interpretation of the acoelomate body plan presumes that the hydrostatic sup- port provided by a pseudocoelom or coelom in other animal phyla could be provided by the large parenchyma cells of acoelomates (Chapman, 1958). Pedersen (1966) noted variations in the ratio of ECM to parenchyma cells among different turbellarian species and discussed their possible implications in hydrostatic support and motility. Conn &amp; Rocco (1989) suggested that the voluminous fibril-poor ECM of some adult cestodes might play an important role in providing easily modifiable hydrostatic support during the rapid ex- pansion of the uterus. Threadgold &amp; Gallagher (1966) suggested that the con- tinous network of ECM fibrils in the digenean Fasciola hepatica might have a vital function in providing mechanical support. Rieger et al. (1991a) proposed a similar function for turbellarian ECM. To date, no experimental studies have examined the role of parenchyma cells or ECM in providing hydrostatic support for flatworms. Nutrient storage. The abundance of glycogen storage depots within the parenchyma of flatworms has been recognized for many years. Jennings (1977) 252</page><page sequence="13">VOL. 112, NO. 4, OCTOBER 1993 has suggested that storage of glycogen by flatworms may have been an important factor in preadapting some flatworms for entosymbiosis. Authors of early ul- trastructural and histochemical studies frequently suggested that the glycogen stores were used for periods of nutrient deprivation in turbellarians (Pedersen, 1961), digeneans (Fried &amp; Kraemer, 1968; Threadgold &amp; Gallagher, 1966), and cestodes (Hedrick &amp; Daugherty, 1957; Lumsden, 1966; Reissig &amp; Colluci, 1968; Zdatrska, 1975). Threadgold &amp; Arme (1974) demonstrated parenchyma cell autophagy involving glycogen store diminution during periods of experimental starvation in the adult digenean F. hepatica; similar glycogen diminution in this species was shown by Bennett (1977) to occur during juvenile-adult trans- formation. The possible nutrient-storage role of lipid droplets in myocytons of flatworm parenchyma has not been explored fully. Such a nutrient-storage role might be possible for some species; however, most digeneans and cestodes are anaerobic and apparently are unable to mobilize the lipid stores (Frayha &amp; Smyth, 1983). Motility. The fact that myocytes make up a large portion of the parenchyma's mass in flatworms reflects the importance of parenchyma to motility. The structure of the contractile portions of mesenchymal myocytes has been studied in detail for several turbellarians (MacRae, 1965; Morita, 1965; Rieger et al., 1991a), trematodes (Fried &amp; Haseeb, 1991; Smyth &amp; Halton, 1983), and cestodes (Lumsden &amp; Byram, 1967; Ward et al., 1986). Generally, these myofibrils are strikingly similar structurally and histochemically to those in the smooth muscles of other animal phyla (Sarnat, 1984). Source of undifferentiated cells for regeneration. One of the most important functions of parenchyma in many turbellarians seems to be the replacement of injured epithelial and mesenchymal tissues, or their regeneration after pe- riodic atrophy (Baguina et al., 1989; Gremigni, 1988; Hori, 1980, 1983a,b). Regeneration of complex organs (e.g., the pharynx of planarians) and entire body regions apparently involves the cooperation of neoblasts with other cells of the parenchyma (Hori, 1991, 1992b) and overlying epithelia (Asai, 1990, 1991). Conversely, this regenerative ability seems to be highly limited or non- existent in the neodermatans (see "Neoblasts," above). Structural interactions with other tissues. In addition to the functions served exclusively by parenchyma, there are functions that require the specific pa- renchyma cells and epithelia to develop and function as a single anatomical unit. This was demonstrated in the case of the cestode Oochoristica anolis in which lipid-rich myocytons occurred permanently in close juxtaposition to the specialized uterine epithelium, presumably providing the enclosed eggs with extra protection (Conn, 1985; Conn &amp; Etges, 1984). Branching and compart- mentalization of the cestode uterus may be influenced by the parenchyma (Conn, 1993), perhaps resulting in interspecific variations in the basic form of the uterus (Conn &amp; Forman, 1993). Similar structural/functional cooperation between parenchyma cells, specialized gland cells, and overlying epithelia also appears to occur in the rostellum (Specian &amp; Lumsden, 1980) and cirrus pouch (Jones, 1988) of some cestodes, as well as in the complex and highly varied proboscides of many turbellarians (De Vocht, 1989; Rieger et al., 1991a). 253</page><page sequence="14">TRANS. AM. MICROSC. SOC. Transport. Parenchyma, in general, and parenchymal ECM, specifically, long have been thought to play a major role in transport of nutrients and other materials in flatworms (Gallagher &amp; Threadgold, 1967; Pedersen, 1961). Pre- sumably, this also would include a major indirect role in excretion and osmo- regulation, wherein ions and metabolic waste products would be transported through the ECM to the protonephridial system as suggested by Threadgold &amp; Gallagher (1966). In the absence of a fluid-filled circulatory system or body cavity, this function seems unavoidable; however, to date no conclusive exper- imental studies have been performed. Modifiable tissue for morphogenesis. Various mesenchymal cells and their associated ECM play important developmental roles in the morphogenesis of organs throughout the animal kingdom (Trinkaus, 1984), particularly through their interactions with adjacent epithelia (Hay, 1984). Such morphogenetic activity generally involves cell migration, cell senescence, specific changes in cell shape and/or alterations in cell: ECM ratio (Ettensohn, 1985). The latter three activities have been demonstrated in the adult cestode Mesocestoides lineatus during histogenesis of the paruterine organ (Conn, 1987, 1988a). Ul- trastructural data on the paruterine capsules of the cestode Cylindrotaenia hickmani suggest a similar morphogenetic activity (Jones, 1988). Ultrastructural and cytochemical characteristics of the fully developed cysticercoids of other cestodes suggest similar parenchymal activity in capsule morphogenesis (Allison et al., 1972; Bogitsh, 1969; Caley, 1974, 1975, 1976; Krasnoshchekov et al., 1979; Ubelaker et al., 1970). Probably, this sort of morphogenetic activity is an important function of parenchyma throughout the phylum Platyhelminthes; studies of this function should be a high priority in the future. Oxygen storage. Some symbiotic marine rhabdocoel turbellarians have been shown to possess parenchyma cells that are specialized for the synthesis and storage of hemoglobin. Jennings &amp; Hick (1990) reported that the hemoglobin- containing cells of these species are typically associated with specific organs such as the vitellaria and suggested that they function in facilitating oxygen diffusion to those organs. EMERGING OR POTENTIAL MODELS Generally, flatworms have not been used widely as experimental model organisms for studies of mechanisms of general zoological interest. The primary exception to this statement has been the long-standing use of planarians as models for studying regeneration. As we develop a greater understanding of turbellarian parenchyma, in general, and neoblasts, in particular, we likely will see this model gain ground in the context of modern molecular techniques used in investigating the developmental biology of regeneration and cellular deter- mination. In some respects, cestodes might make excellent models for certain types of developmental studies. This is because the adult stage of most tapeworms consists of a chain of proglottids, each with its own hermaphroditic set of reproductive systems, attached in a single strobila. The proglottids are produced consecutively from the neck region of the worm, so that a single strobila isolated 254</page><page sequence="15">VOL. 112, NO. 4, OCTOBER 1993 at any given time contains a chronologically arranged sequence of genital, gametogenic, and embryonic developmental stages; this frequently ranges from before the appearance of distinguishable genital primordia through complete development and senescence of the organs involved. As discussed above (see "Functional Aspects"), parenchyma cells and the ECM in which they are embedded already have been implicated in certain morphogenetic events. Conceivably, the rapid growth and branching of the uterus during the unique strobilation process of adult cestodes could make a convenient system for study- ing branching morphogenesis, a process which thus far has relied primarily on models such as mammary glands and salivary glands of other phyla (Ettensohn, 1985; Trinkaus, 1984). In phylogenetic terms, flatworm parenchyma should be studied more with respect to its relationship to the evolution of triploblastic animals. According to many of the more commonly accepted phylogenetic schemes, flatworms occupy an important position as primitive and arguably archetypic triploblasts (Conn, 1991). Given this and the fact that the triploblastic condition is thought to have been requisite to the evolution of most animal phyla (Fransen, 1982), further study of flatworm parenchyma should prove to be a fruitful and exciting area for evolutionary zoologists. WHERE ARE THE TEXTBOOKS WRONG? In reviewing the treatment of flatworms in general biology and invertebrate zoology textbooks, surprisingly little is mentioned about parenchyma and ECM. What is communicated generally tends to treat parenchyma as only a space filler or packing material. The foregoing discussion demonstrates that this is far from reality. Future textbooks should treat parenchyma as the highly com- plex and variable tissue that it is. Similarly, most invertebrate zoology textbooks have failed to stay abreast of the voluminous literature on animal ECM that has emerged during recent years. As with animal models being used on the forefront of ECM research, flatworm ECM is undoubtedly a dynamic com- ponent of both parenchymal and epithelial systems, and thus warrants serious treatment even in introductory texts. Along similar lines, one of the most misleading references to flatworm pa- renchyma is its frequent designation as "connective tissue." Unfortunately, this term is deeply entrenched in the zoological literature, but is highly ambiguous and obsolete in most of its usage. The term "connective tissue" should be eliminated in reference to flatworm parenchyma because (1) it implies a func- tion primarily or exclusively associated with connecting other tissues or organs to one another, which clearly is not the primary role of flatworm parenchyma; (2) it implies erroneously that flatworm parenchyma is comparable to connective tissues in eucoelomate phyla; and (3) the term is highly ambiguous even as applied to the flatworms, some authors using it in synonymy with all of the parenchyma, and others using it in reference only to the ECM. One possibility worth considering is that the greatest error found in the literature, and one perpetuated by the present review, even might be persistence in using the term "parenchyma." Inasmuch as our understanding of the com- 255</page><page sequence="16">TRANS. AM. MICROSC. SOC. plexity and functional diversity of mesenchymal tissues in flatworms has ex- panded during recent years, the time may be appropriate to begin phasing the term out, preferring more specific terms that describe specific structural and/ or physiological units of mesenchymal tissue. This has occurred already in the case of calcareous corpuscles and genital Anlagen-discrete units of mesen- chymal tissue that are identified easily. However, unlike the eucoelomates, flatworms have not developed a large number of discrete epitheliomesenchymal organs (Conn, 1988a). Like nematodes and other pseudocoelomates, most flat- worm organs are entirely epithelial. As a result, although mesenchymal tissue in flatworms may show substantial intra- and interspecific heterogeneity as described above, it usually does exist as a single continuous tissue within any individual worm. Thus, the concept of parenchyma as a single identifiable structural entity of flatworms should be retained for present purposes. CONCLUSIONS Clearly, the complexity, variety, and importance of parenchyma cells and ECM in flatworms is just beginning to be realized, with few investigators currently concentrating on the subject. The information compiled here suggests that new efforts to explore this little-known aspect of flatworm and acoelomate biology will be rewarded with a better understanding of flatworm biology in general. I hope that this review will stimulate further inquiry. LITERATURE CITED ALLEN, W. B. &amp; NOLLEN, P. M. 1991.
