Freiburg: Academic Press Fribourg, 2005. Pp. 392 (hardback). ISBN 3-7278-1508-6 Reviewed by Yosef Garfinkel, Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University This publication is the first in a series of five books dedicated to the iconography of the Southern Levant, sometimes with references to other parts of the ancient Near East, from a biblical (Old Testament) point of view. In a way, it aims to replace Pritchard's classical publication of 1954 (second edition 1969): The Ancient Near East in Pictures Relating to the the Old Testament. The series is organized in chronological order, and accordingly, the first book deals with the earliest periods, from the Natufian culture of the Epi-Paleolithic (termed here, anachronistically, 'Mesolithic') until the end of the Early Bronze Age. In absolute chronology the period dealt with by the current book lasted for ca. 10,000 years, from the 12th millennium BC till the end of the 3rd millennium BC. The later four books in this series will deal all together with a period of less then 2,000 years. The entire set of five books will be an excellent pictorial companion to Biblical studies. The book starts with a methodological introduction which serves for the entire series (pp. 11-33). Here the authors' principles are presented to the readers. I found this part of the work most interesting, but it is not always clear how these methodological points are actually integrated into the analysis of the data in the rest of the book. This aspect will be elaborated upon after a brief description of the book. The survey of the artistic images deals with a number of representative objects from each of the following periods: Epi-Paleolithic (4 items), Neolithic (46 items), Chalcolithic (91 items) and finally the Early Bronze Age (262 items). In the earlier periods these are mainly human and animal representations on figurines, statues, and rock engravings. The Chalcolithic and Bronze Age artifacts are usually more sophisticated, and also include metal objects, pottery and seals. For each item the book supplies a useful text, indicating relevant aspects like place of discovery, archaeological context, materials used, manufacturing techniques, state of preservation, size, description, parallel images and bibliography. In addition there is a high quality drawing for each item. No photographs are included. The geographical focus is the Southern Levant but occasionally relevant images are presented from various other regions (Syria, Mesopotamia, Anatolia and Egypt) as can 245</page><page sequence="2">246 YOSEF GARFINKEL be seen on the map given at the very beginning of the book. This is a correct approach, viewing the entire Near East as a cultural milieu and not as isolated regional units. Maps of the Southern Levant with the location of the sites mentioned are provided at the beginning of each main period. The maps and the drawings of the artifacts are well done, providing the book with an elegant appearance. Thus, the book is enjoyable not only for professionals but for the general public too. As this book review is written to the readers of Mitekufat Haeven, Journal of the Israel Prehistoric Society, I will try to place it now in the context of prehistoric studies, although it was not intended for this purpose by its authors. The 50 Natufian and Neolithic artifacts are not only a brief introduction to students and scholars of the Bible and Ancient Near East, but according to the book, present the earliest roots of Biblical iconography. In a similar way, Moorey (2003), in his Schweich Lectures at the British Academy, when dealing with clay figurines from the Biblical royal cities of Jerusalem and Samaria (8-6 centuries BC), started his study in the Neolithic period. As mentioned above, it is not always clear how the methodological points presented in the introduction are actually integrated into the analysis of the data. For example, figurines of birds and goats are compared to texts from the Song of Songs. But the same can be done with images of birds and goats of the Paleolithic cave art of France and northern Spain. In other words, the main methodological problem is our ability to connect remote prehistoric phenomena with Biblical contexts. Scholars from various disciplines, like prehistory, archaeology, history, art history, Semitic languages and Biblical Studies will reject such possible connections. Indeed, the relevance of Neolithic art to the later urban societies of the Bronze and Iron Ages has not been recognized by the leading authorities of the previous generations. For example, "The prehistoric clay figurines of men and animals do not differ in character from similar artless objects found throughout Asia and Europe. A history of art may ignore them, since they cannot be considered the ancestors of Sumerian sculpture" (Frankfort 1955: 2), and "for this early period we cannot assume the existence of concepts of anthropomorphic deities similar to those later known in the cultures of the ancient Near East" (Porada 1965). However, the idea that we do have continuity from the prehistoric era into the urban cultures of the ancient Near East can no longer be ignored, as was the case in the earlier days of research. These old concepts are falling apart as new rich data from the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods rapidly accumulate. As early as 1962 Amiran pointed out a connection between the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B plastered statues of Jericho and the myth of the creation of man in the Sumerian and Biblical texts. In 1994,1 discussed the phenomenon of ritual burial of cultic objects, and pointed out to a long list of features that appeared in the Neolithic period and were continually practiced in later periods, some of them even today (Garfinkel 1994). Moorey did the same in the above mentioned study. Thus, the work of Schroer and Keel clearly reflect a paradigm shift in art history research of the ancient Near East. Nevertheless, there is still much work to be carried out, methodologically or in specific case studies, in order to establish convincing relationships between the prehistoric era and the historical periods. Although the symbols and art of the Neolithic most certainly changed</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEW 247 meaning in the contexts of later urban societies and mere material continuities are trivial, the real issue is understanding the changing meanings and functions of the symbols through the millennia. This is a challenge future studies will have to confront. In conclusion, the five books will be the best collection of art images put together from the ancient Near East. Schroer and Keel should be congratulated for taking such an enormous task upon themselves, and for the high quality of the graphics. This will be a most welcome working tool to anybody who would like to see the available artistic data associated with the Biblical world. Amiran R. 1962.
