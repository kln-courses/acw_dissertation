<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FRENCH REVIEW, Vol. XLIX, No. 1, October, 1975 Printed in U.S.A. Mysticism in the Age of Reason: Jacques Cazotte and the Demons by Kenneth J. Fleurant REBIRTH OF INTEREST in a particular author is, in large measure, determined by the similarities between his works and the general world view of the rediscovering age. In other words, neglected works are seldom revived without a concomitant revival of ideas, style or emotions to create a sympathetic vibration in the contemporary reader. We are presently, it seems to me, in an age remarkably analogous to the second half of the eighteenth century-two periods of tremendous scientific and technological growth characterized by unbounded faith in the future through the powers of technology and the mind. Paradoxically, however, along with this so-called spirit of rationality, social observers witnessed then, as we do now, a strong and frequently naive mystical reaction creating a dialectical interplay between the empirical cognition of science and the a priori belief in metaphysical transcendence, a conviction that there lies something more beyond the end of the microscope transcending man's rational faculties, a belief that Lionel Trilling refers to as a desperate "impulse to impugn and transcend the limits of rational mind."' I propose that irrationalism and reason are two children of the same mother, unlikely twins fathered by the same social, philosphical and psychological conditions. The popular occultism that spread through eighteenth-century Europe was directly related to the empirical materialism of the Enlightenment in two ways. Frequently it served as a complementary adjunct to a rational, though limited, description of the universe, a blend of science and pseudo-occultism creating something akin to the self-styled "fantastic realism" of Bergier and Pauwels' recent Matin des magiciens.2 The visionary Swedenborg was a noted scientist as well as a mystic and saw no contradiction between his two modes of knowledge; Franz Mesmer equated the occult forces of animal magnetism with the magnetic field of the mineral magnet and his occult theories were systematically subjected to scrutiny by the Academie des Sciences. As occultists, these men were primarily concerned with ontological questions-the nature of the universe and man's function within it on both the visible and unseen, or occult, plane. This positive relationship between the 'Lionel Trilling, "Mind in the Modern World," Times Literary Supplement (17 November 1972), p. 1385. 2 Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier, Le Matin des magiciens (Paris: Gallimard, 1960). 68</page><page sequence="2">rational and the occult, was opposed by a second "school" of occultists that grew out of a strong negative reaction to the demystification of the cosmos. Jacques Cazotte is representative of this second occultist group, a mystical strain more interested in ethical problems than in questions of existence. His brief encounter in the late 1770s with the Martinist doctrines of Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin solidified this negative reaction, that had been germinating for a number of years, to philosophic and scientific ideas which threatened the monarchy and the Catholic Church. The groping instability of the rationalist era contrasted sharply with Cazotte's search for absolute standards of morality, religion and government. In a certain real sense, these two mystic groups are more representative of the eighteenth century than the commonly accepted rationalist paragons, for they characterize the tension between rationalism and the occult that gave the Enlightenment much of its dynamism. Jacques Cazotte provides us with a microcosm of this dynamic tension between the rational and the metaphysical in his works and in his life. Cazotte's illuminist ideology, the result of a personal predilection for spiritualism and a psychological need to react to social change, is an oxymoronic combination of politics and mysticism of which we capture provocative glimpses in the pages of his correspondence. Many of his letters provide us with a new and refreshing view of the dynamic feelings and emotions that were the counterparts to the Revolutionary pragmatism of the day. Much of the wealth of Cazotte's anti-revolutionary letters has remained untapped and little more than the obvious conclusion that Cazotte was a counter-revolutionary has been said about them. E. P. Shaw's highly readable and reliable bibliographical sketch3 treats them as one would a political treatise, neglecting their mystical significance altogether and, as a result, misinterprets them at what might seem to be their face value. In actuality, the politico-philosophic correspondence of Cazotte is a strange mixture of natural and supernatural logic. This melange of rational and mystical creates a dialectical ambiguity reflecting the state of Cazotte's mind as-the mystic and royalist found himself confronted with a rationalist and Republican move- ment. Hoping to preserve the monarchy and Catholicism, he was divided as to the means he would best employ. On the one hand, the counter-revolution he planned was to be a forcible overthrow of the Jacobins following a well- wrought plan (or so he thought) for the return of the emigre armies into France. The correspondence contains tactical, military strategy which in- cludes an offer of Cazotte's own estate to the king. On the other hand, the counter-revolution is spoken of as a bloodless, spiritual restoration of monarchy and religion through the intervention of the intermediary spirits. The end product might aptly be termed "the politics of mysticism" or perhaps "the mysticism of politics." Those letters which are politically militaristic pose no interpretative 3E. P.

In them are depicted the disorders of the Jacobin Friends of the Constitution which, for Cazotte, typified the plight of the entire nation on the verge of chaos as a result of the lunacy of the National Assembly and the blight of thieves and beggars in the large cities. The country was threatened from within by civil war and from without by foreign adventurers ready to invade France as if it were the fabled land of Cockaigne.4 Through it all, Cazotte failed to understand fully the social and psychologi- cal causes of the Revolution and this, chiefly because he considered the whole phenomenon as philosophic and spiritual in origin. And as a result, he felt that the material reasons were infinitely less important than the underlying spiritual ones. As all illuminists in the tradition of Jacob Boehme, Cazotte was a Neo-Platonist and his view of the Revolution coincides with the concept of Platonic essence, that is, the reality of an object, or by extension here an event, which lies hidden below the surface reality of appearance. In any event, the true cause of the Revolution was the Devil, not only in a metaphorical sense (although Cazotte, at times, was not adverse to speaking metaphorically) but also, and I think the indications are incontrovertible, in a very real sense. Within the context of Cazotte's Martinistic belief, it was implausible to think that a spiritual force such as the demons, or the angels for that matter, could directly accomplish anything in a material world, so the intermediation of men was of prime importance. Through men, then, the demons were responsible for the revolutionary upheavals. In one of his more, shall we say, radical statements, a letter dated 26 August 1791, Cazotte goes so far as to trace the modern origins of the problems plaguing the Bourbon house to one man, the sixteenth-century Neapolitan astrologer Luc Gaurik, working through the devil-that is working his nefarious deeds as if he were the hand of Lucifer himself. "Je vous parlais d'un Luc Gaurik," Cazotte wrote to his friend Pouteau. "Je ne savais pas que ce malheureux magicien fut la principale cause des maux dont la famille Bourbon est affligee."5 He now knew the fate of the Bourbons had been decided over two hundred years before when Catherine de Medicis hired the astrologer to cast a spell over them. The demons were everywhere in the 1780s, behind every revolutionary of every stripe but luckily, suggests Cazotte, men of the psychic strength of Gaurik are few and far between although unfortunately, at the same time, it is just as difficult to find strong-willed people to combat them.6 4 Jacques Cazotte,(Euvres badines et morales, historiques et philosphiques de Jacques Cazotte (Paris: Bastien, 1817), Vol. I (of 4), cviii.

The novel Maugraby, for example, is based on the theme of the evil magician as are a number of tales in the Suite des Mille et une nuits and Le Diable amoureux revolves around the intricately woven theme of will. 70 FRENCH REVIEW</page><page sequence="4">The roster of revolutionaries under the Devil's sway was long, for, apart from Luc Gaurik, the Jacobins and the renegade Duc d'Orleans, the demons had also taken control of the philosophes, scientists, freemasons and women. Certainly the inclusion of women on the list multiplied the number of possessed beings. Cazotte believed that all women were Eves incapable of rejecting demonic advances and that they, like their progenetrix, were guilty of dragging men with them into hell. Of course this view was not terribly novel during the eighteenth century. Voltaire's Dictionnaire philosophique (article "Genese") and the Marquis d'Argens' Philosophe amoureux to mention but two examples in passing, both refer to the physical, mental and moral inferiority of women. The difference, however, is in Cazotte's spiritualization of evil underscoring woman's complicity and collusion with Satan. And then, of course, there was the ever-present spirit of philosophic and scientific enlightenment which pervaded the country, perverting its adherents with its diabolic theories. Practically the entire nation (actually three-quarters of the nation by Cazotte's estimation) had been swept away by the false pride engendered by the philosophes and the false dreams of hope of the scientists. The worst one could say of a man was that he was a philosophe: "N'appelez pas vos adversaires demagogues," he wrote to his brother-in-law, "appelez-les philosophes, c'est la plus grande injure qu'on puisse dire a un homme."7 Very little distinguished the philosophe from the scientist; it was a difference of degrees. At one point Cazotte draws an interesting analogy between philoso- phy and a scientific event which ranked, in the minds of many enlightened cognoscenti, as the most important technical advance of the century-the manned balloon. "Reflechissez sur les ballons," he suggests, "et voyez-y la philosophie du siecle, cherchant a escalader le ciel. Suivez l'image jusqu'au bout; je n'ai besoin que de vous donner le fil. Nous avons eu preuve que l'invention etait une suggestion diabolique, et voyez comme nos badauds s'en glorifiaient" (letter 14). Cazotte's conservative reaction to technological progress was only natural in the 1780s since science and the idea of progress had come to be associated with Republicanism.8 Besides, flying was not na- tural to man and symbolized the widespread changes that were so completely destroying all the old and venerable modes of thought and life, all that the conservative Cazotte held sacred. After the Montgolfier brothers discovered that heated air would rise and carry a balloon aloft, Pilatre de Rozier became the first to apply the principle to manned flights in 1783. He and those aeronauts who followed in 1784 became heroes, literally worshipped in the streets of Metz, Lyon and Paris. It would not have been difficult for Cazotte's friend Pouteau to draw the intended conclusions for the references to aeronautical experimentation. On 15 June 1785 Rozier was killed when the fire 7 An unnumbered letter,(Euvres badines et morales, I, Ixxiii. 8 Marat urged youth to study science and wrote a treatise on fire ( Recherches physiques sur le feu, 1780) and Robespierre publicly spoke with fervor of the scientific future of man.

The scientist, like the philosophe, had tried to scale the heavens. Both had failed. The same letter contains a captivatingly obscure reference to a Philippe Bourgeon who, the inference is, attempted to combine demoniacal powers and balloons in some sort of republican scheme. The demise of Bourgeon, we know not how but we may suppose during a flight, was proof positive for Cazotte of the Devil's involvement. For some reason Cazotte felt he could not commit to paper Bourgeon's "transactions" which he had been following in some mysterious manner for three years. This was all sheer idiocy for Cazotte, one more symptom of the great folly gripping the nation and, to make matters worse, hordes of pseudo-mystics were coming out of the walls declaring themselves in favor of revolution and progress. It was about this time that formerly spiritual organizations, the Freemasons and assorted "Chevaliers," even the Martinists themselves began to politicize into social action clubs. Cazotte left the latter organization, probably in 1779 or 1780 for precisely this reason. The Mesmerists have often been included with these mystic organizations, but at the time they were closer to the common acceptation of science and nothing was more natural than for Mesmer to consider himself a confrere of Galvani and Bacon. After all, the word science is half of the term "sciences occultes." But Cazotte thought no more of them than he did of the masses of people attracted by the fad of supernaturalism, those who, as he said, "galopaient apres les sciences occultes" (letter 20) exposing themselves, like Alvare in Le Diable amoureux, to grave danger and ridicule by tampering with the "other reality" without training or proper intentions. Cagliostro was connected directly to "l'infame association existante en Europe contre les pouvoirs divins et humains" (letter 26) and the street prophets and prophetesses like Suzette Labrousse and Catherine Theot were not much better off. From Luc Gaurik to the treacherous Philippe Egalite, a long line of weak-spirited men had willy nilly become agents of hell. And these were the stronger among men! The common people could be led anywhere. Yet in spite of his frequent pessimism in view of the way things were turning, Cazotte was not always a prophet of the apocalypse for he firmly believed that the spiritual illness of society would be cured and he was confident in his role as a chosen theurgist. Since it was a spiritual illness, a spiritual solution had to be sought. This solution was in the form of the spiritual counter-revolution of a select coterie of mystics divinely commissioned to spearhead the spiritual movement to restore God and his servant, the king, to their rightful positions of honor. I would once again stress the fact that this spiritualistic view of the problem plaguing the nation and the proposed solutions were more than simple metaphorical constructs. When Cazotte told the Fouquier-Tinville jury which was to send him to the gallows for treason, that prayer was the only recourse he had against the revolutionaries, he had something more in mind than commonplace, passive petitions to God; his prayer was the active Martinist 72 FRENCH REVIEW</page><page sequence="6">participation as a mystic-by selection and not by choice-in the destiny of man. Several letters in particular express their author's belief in the role mysticism was to play in God's plan to protect the divine right of Louis XVI. Je vous ai prevenu que nous etions huit en tout dans la France, absolument inconnus les uns des autres [he explained to Pouteau ], qui elevions, mais sans cesse, comme Moise, les yeux, la voix, les bras vers le ciel pour la decision d'un combat dans lequel les elements eux-memes sont mis en jeu.... Nous sommes sirs d'etre employes, mais ce que nous faisons nous passe. Les grands et les petits prophetes etaient aussi quinze-vingts [aveugles] que nous; et ce qu'ils nous ont laisse est plein de lumieres qui percent sous l'enveloppe. [letter 21] From this letter dated just a few months before his arrest several facts proceed: Cazotte believed he had a task to perform in a mystic counter-revolu- tion as one of the chosen theurgists (of which there were only eight in the entire country) and felt he possessed a particular charismatic gift for effecting material change on earth; he believed he was a prophet, a descendant of the Old Testament prophets; the elements themselves had joined in the battle against the revolutionaries; and the millennium so long awaited and so often predicted was finally at hand. He appears to have reconciled his ambivalent feelings of pessimism and optimism by suggesting, as the September '92 days of terror approached, that the Revolution was the onset of the final days of the contemporary era, and, as a result, that even if monarchy and religion were suppressed, this very catastrophe would be transmuted into good, heralding the long awaited second coming and the beginning of a thousand years of peaceful, theocratic rule. These letters show the extent of Cazotte's mystical elitism and hearken back to the legendary Rosicrucian belief that charismatic powers were given to a select few (in 1652 Elias Ashmole speaks of 36 invisibles) who would only be called upon to use them at the dawn of the Apocalypse. The theory is historically recurrent and polyethnic and related to the Greek tradition of the seven sages. A slightly earlier letter (26 August 1791) than the one above explained the necessity for simultaneous group action of the participating theosophists in order to ensure the efficacity of their prayers and also explained the need for secrecy to the point where none of the sages could know of the others' roles. During his trial he admitted that this knowledge was imparted to him in a vision. At times, he complained about being kept in the dark but rationalized the need for indirect knowledge in the manner of his Martinist teachers who believed in the blinding force of the light that struck the mind's eye directly. He uses the image of a worker in the Gobelin tapestry studio working from the opposite side of the loom and, therefore, limited to a dull, indirect and imperfect view of the exact details of the general scheme and design. At the same time he was confident his eyes had been opened as were the prophet Elias's and he believed he saw spiritual beings moving toward the material world for, in spite of the lack of clarity of his vision, he could see 73 JACQUES CAZOTTE</page><page sequence="7">enough detail to be absolutely sure of the overall product of the struggle between the forces of good and the powers of evil. External signs had appeared attesting to the veracity of the interior prophetic vision and they all pointed to the success of the mystic counter-revolution. Cazotte was aware that others, too, had seen and heard strange things in recent days and mentions several, particularly in letters written in January and July 1792-strange sounds and earthquakes from the "region inferieure," bizarre signs and coincidences foreboding the drastic changes about to shake the world order and the ordering of the universe. Two curious documents were found with Cazotte's correspondence, one called "R/evelations" and the other "Mon songe de la nuit du samedi au dimanche de devant la Saint-Jean 1791" which are patently nothing more than syfibolic vignettes using the language of mysticism allegorically. They are ostensibly political tracts meant for publication in the royalist journal of his friend Pouteau and should not be considered part of the correspondence proper. Even though the language is similar, the tone is distinctly different. It is easy to sense the symbolic artifice and the transparency of the allegory is easily noted. Cazotte was as sincere in his mystic persuasions as he was in his political convictions; the two were, in fact, interdependent. Occultism had become a way of life and nothing could prevent it from influencing even the most mundane affairs. For Jacques Cazotte, Martinist spiritualism represented a viable alternative to both scientific determinism and moral relativism, at first through the ceremonial rituals of Martinez de Pasqualis followed by the more somber transcendentalism of Saint-Martin. Cazotte was the staunch conservative struggling with the powers of change. Ironically, it was through this struggle that he found new avenues for the imagination and became a minor hero of the early Romantic generation. It was only because of a timely sequence of events that Cazotte came to confuse reality and fancy, thereby opening the door to "litterature fantastique" which thrives on the confused state in which neither character nor reader ever knows whether events are of a real or supernatural, or perhaps imaginary nature. It was the social milieu which so influenced Cazotte's fiction as to make it slowly develop along a path leading to the literature of Dark Romanticism. His earlier works, the troubadour tale, Ollivier, for example, did contain flights of fancy, even glimpses of frenzy, but overall they were amusing bagatelles from the pen of an effulgent optimist. There is a definite progression toward more somber supernaturalism in Cazotte's fiction which corresponds to his ever growing concern for the social and religious decay he felt infected every aspect of contemporary life. Already in 1772 he was toying with the idea of breaking literary tradition to depict the spiritual and physical downfall of the main character of his best known novel, Le Diable amoureux, but reneged on his original plans for fear of ruffling the sensitivity of his compatriots whom he still felt were lighthearted by nature. As he grew older, it became less possible for him to write amusing bagatelles and the power of evil became the dominant feature in his works. The 74 FRENCH REVIEW</page><page sequence="8">JACQUES CAZOTTE 75 anthropomorphic exteriorization of this evil principle in psychologically real forms became one of Cazotte's most lasting contributions to literature. In the final testament of his correspondence, Jacques Cazotte's fictional demons are externalized in a bizarre, mystical expression of his fears and convictions. His imaginary world became so real that Cazotte lived his dreams during the Revolution and saw the demons of his subconscious come to life in his old age.
