Depic- tions of various types of torture and sacrifice were modeled and painted on ceramic vessels. Individuals are shown strapped to wooden structures, where they would be tormented by vultures, mutilated, and ultimately de- capitated and dismembered (see, for example, Berrin 1997: 152, fig. 93). One of the most complex scenes painted on Moche vessels is known as the Sacrifice Ceremony (Introduc- tion, this volume, fig. 5; Alva and Donnan 1993: figs. 132, 143). In this scene, naked men are sacrificed by having blood drawn from their necks; their hearts may also have been removed. On the upper register, a goblet, pre- sumably filled with the blood of the victims, is being exchanged between human and what appear to be supernatural individuals. In the last fifteen years, a number of major archaeological discoveries have transformed our perception of Moche society and our understanding of their system of represen- tation. Many of these new finds contain clear evidence of human sacrifice, giving us archaeological confirmation that at least some of the practices known from the iconog- raphy were indeed carried out. Perhaps the most important of these finds occurred in 1987, with Walter Alva's discovery of the Sipán tombs in the Lambayeque Valley (Alva, this volume, and 1988, 1990; Alva and Donnan 1993). For the first time, not only was it possible to see the complete, complex burial chambers of some of the highest-rank- ing individuals of Moche society, but it was also possible to link these individuals with the Sacrifice Ceremony. For example, the individual in Tomb 1 at Sipán was recognized as one of the main protagonists of the cere- mony, while Tomb 2 was seen as the resting place of his counterpart, a figure identified as the Bird Priest. A third personage of the Sacri- fice Ceremony, a female, was found at San José de Moro in the Jequetepeque Valley a few years later by Christopher Donnan and Luis Jaime Castillo (1992, 1994). Furthermore, Daniel Arsenault (1994: 217) suggests that a female burial at Huaca de la Cruz in the Virú Valley, originally excavated in the late 1940s by members of the Virú Valley Project, is also linked to the Sacrifice Ceremony. He argues that a wooden staff found alongside her is similar to an anthropomorphized staff on the lower right of the rollout drawing of the Sacrifice Ceremony (Introduction, this vol- ume, fig. 5). In this scene, the anthropo- morphic staff is shown drawing blood from a captive. It has therefore become clear that individuals attired in the same regalia as the figures of the Sacrifice Ceremony were interred in various places in the Moche region, and over several generations, suggest- ing that this sort of ritual may indeed have occurred as something of a regular practice in Moche culture. 89</page><page sequence="3">i .

T1-T4 mark the positions of tombs These excavations have also provided spe- cific evidence of extensive and complex sacri- ficial practices among the Moche. In many instances human sacrifice was part of elabo- rate funerary rituals. At Sipán, San José de Moro, and Huaca de la Cruz, individuals appear to have been sacrificed and placed over tombs of high-status individuals to act as guardians (Alva and Donnan 1993; Strong and Evans 1952).1 The practice of interring a male directly above a principal burial is known from Tomb 1 and Tomb 2 at Sipán, and the tomb of the Warrior Priest at Huaca de la Cruz (Alva and Donnan 1993,- Strong and Evans 1952). Moreover, at Sipán the guardians' feet were missing, further under- scoring the sacrificial nature of these burials. Other examples of sacrifice have been found at Huanchaco in the Moche Valley, Huaca Cao Viejo in the Chicama Valley, and Dos Cabezas in the Jequetepeque Valley (Cordy- Collins, in press; Donnan and Foote 1978; Franco, Gálvez, and Vásquez 1995, 1996). In 1995 the single largest sample of human sacrifice known for the Moche was found at the site of Huaca de la Luna in the Moche Valley (fig. 1) (Bourget 1997a, 1997b, 1998a, 1998b). More than seventy individuals were 90 BOURGET</page><page sequence="4">3. View of Plaza 3 A and Platform II at the beginning of excavations sacrificed during at least five episodes. The sacrifices were carried out in Plaza 3 A, lo- cated to the east of the principal platform of Huaca de la Luna, Platform I (fig. 2). The sacrificed individuals were found to the north of a natural rocky outcrop, a feature that may have been the impetus for the construction of Plaza 3A and its adjacent platform, Platform II, in this area (fig. 3). High adobe walls on the north and south sides of platform/plaza con- nect this area with the rest of the Huaca de la Luna complex. These walls, even in their current eroded state, reach eight meters in height. At least two of the sacrificial episodes appear to be closely linked with the phenome- non of El Niño, an often severe geoclimatic perturbation that can result in downpours, massive flooding, famine, and disease on this normally arid coast. The sacrificial victims of Plaza 3A were found embedded in clay, indi- cating that the rituals were performed during spells of torrential rains brought by El Niño. The sequence of events and, in many in- stances, the precise positioning of the human remains suggest a high degree of ritual orga- nization. After each ritual, the mutilated re- mains of the victims were left in the plaza, exposed to the sun and the wind, where they played host to countless flies who deposited their eggs in the rotting flesh (fig. 4). Ritual specialists must have conducted these prac- tices according to strict guidelines. The evi- dence from Huaca de la Luna and other Moche sites indicates that these practices formed an integral part of Moche religious and ideo- logical organization. In the first part of this contribution, I will consider Moche warfare, capture and sacri- fice, comparing visual representations with archaeological data obtained from various Moche sites. Emphasis will be given to the Huaca de la Luna, as it provides our most extensive data set on this subject. Using a comparative approach, it will be possible to evaluate how closely the visual representation of warfare and sacrificial practices matches evidence from the archaeological record. In the second part of this paper, symbolic dimensions of these practices will be ex- plored, such as the close associations between the sacrificial victims of Plaza 3 A of Huaca de la Luna and sea lions. Moche practices and beliefs about death will also be investigated, especially aspects regarding natural processes such as decay and insect infestation. Finally, I will discuss the ways in which the events at BOURGET 91</page><page sequence="5">4- Human remains in Plaza 3A.

Ritual or Secular Warfare? The nature of Moche warfare is still a matter of debate (Topic and Topic 1997; Verano, this volume). Various authors have discussed the problem of demonstrating secular warfare during the Moche period, and have used the fine-line depictions of battle scenes as cor- roborating evidence for full-scale battles for territorial expansion. For example, David Wilson (1988: 66) mentions that the Moche achieved integration of the north coast val- leys through warfare, although the physical evidence of such practices is lacking. He argues that " there is clear iconographie evi- dence in pottery and murals both for inter- regional warfare and for conquest/7 Did the Moche engage in large-scale battles? Are the fine-line depictions of bellicose activities such as armed combats or taking prisoners on 92 BOURGET Moche ceramics indicative of military cam- paigns, perhaps for territorial gain? Certainly it is difficult to try to separate artificially "ritual" and "secular" warfare. Armed con- flicts and wars often have ritualized aspects, thus blurring the line between this distinc- tion. This said, it is worthwhile to consider whether the depictions of Moche battles were intended to represent more mundane, per- haps territorial conflict, or whether they were intended to evoke conflict that was an inte- gral part of religious practices. The seventy individuals found in Plaza 3 A at Huaca de la Luna were a select group. All were male, between the ages of fifteen and thirty-nine, with an average age of twenty- three (Verano 1998). Their skeletal morpholo- gy indicates that they were healthy, strong individuals who were physically very active. Many of them had well-healed fractures, and at least eleven of them had fresh injuries, sug- gesting that they were probably warriors cap- tured during violent encounters. Although</page><page sequence="6">5 . Interior view of a flaring bowl showing a procession of captured warriors Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin (VA-48171) warriors are frequently depicted in Moche art, where they are recognizable through their protective helmets, backflaps,2 shields, and warclubs, this is the first archaeological evi- dence of such a large number of warriors. Christopher Donnan (1997) has suggested that the main objective of battle was not to kill the opponent but to incapacitate him by a blow to the face or to the legs. Afterward, the victors stripped the vanquished and led them back to temples. A number of painted representations on ceramics suggest that these battles were performed under the guidance or supervision of high-ranking individuals, such as the one represented on a flaring bowl now in the Museum für Völkerkunde in Berlin (fig. 5). Flanked by a bird on each side, he is seen running amidst a group of four warriors with prisoners. Birds are closely associated with scenes of combat and are frequently shown accompanying warriors to the battlefield. Elsewhere I have proposed that these birds could have functioned as metaphoric devices, representing the verbal orders given to war- riors by their chief (Bourget 1989: 121). On the basis of representations of attire and accoutrements, it appears that warriors on both sides of the battle are Moche: foreign- ers are rarely depicted. Apart from a few exceptions, all warriors wear a conical hel- met, or a more elaborate headdress, and a backflap, and carry a round or square shield and a long club. There is no discernable pat- tern in the distribution of symbols on their attire and accoutrements. For example, in Fig- ure 5, each of the victorious warriors wears a bourget 93</page><page sequence="7">6. Wooden clubs deposited at the base of a wall at Huaca Cao Viejo, El Brujo complex, Chicama Valley Collection: Huaca Cao Viejo Archaeological Project different outfit (headdress, tunic, shield), and when one of them holds a square shield, the victim's shield represented in the weapon bundle slung over his shoulder is circular, and vice versa. If this represented secular warfare, one would expect the victorious soldiers to be dressed in the same style, adorned with the same designs, and equipped with similar headdresses and distinctive shields. This alternation between round and square shields has also been noted on an architec- tural relief at Huaca Cao Viejo. In one panel, twenty-four pairs of warriors are organized into four registers, with twelve combatants in each. In the top register the left figure of each pair holds a square shield, and the right figure holds a round shield. This is reversed on the next register,- the third register returns to the same sequence as the top band, and so forth. Representations of combat scenes on diverse media, therefore, appear to show Moche war- riors engaged in a form of intra-Moche ritual- ized warfare. Recent discoveries at Dos Cabezas and Huaca Cao Viejo have provided additional evidence as to the ritual nature of Moche warfare. In a Moche burial at Dos Cabezas, Christopher Donnan and Alana Cordy- Collins found three wooden shields, each about 30 cm in diameter and covered with metal plaques (Christopher Donnan, personal communication, 1999). At Huaca Cao Viejo, two wooden maces were found deposited at the base of a wall (fig. 6) (Franco, Gálvez, and Vásquez 1999). The maces, carved from a sin- gle piece of wood, were originally covered with sheet metal. Although these weapons must have measured at least 120 cm in length, their shafts were less than 3 cm thick. As can be observed in Figure 5, the forms and sizes of these objects closely match those represented in the iconography. Several morphological features of these items suggest that they were more appropriate for ritual battle than for any kind of large-scale warfare. The shields, probably tied to the left wrist of the combat- ant, are too small to have offered much pro- tection. The long, slender shafts of the maces make them relatively fragile and ineffective against an enemy. After the maces were bro- ken, possibly in battle, they were deposited at the base of a wall at Huaca Cao Viejo, empha- sizing once more the sacred and ritual dimen- sions of these objects. The metal coverings of 94 BOURGET the shields and the maces also underscore the ritual nature of these accoutrements. This does not mean that the Moche did not engage in more secularized, full-scale or all- out warfare. Such a subject, however, was clearly deemed unsuitable, or perhaps un- necessary, for depiction. If large-scale warfare were depicted, one would expect to see the type of weapons generally used in such bat- tles, including slingshots, lances, and spear- throwers. Almost none of these are shown outside of deer hunting scenes.3 The Moche were more interested in showing details of what appears to have been a warrior cult or class. Moche artists and their patrons chose to emphasize the ritual of combat, most likely a specific ritual sequence culminating in the sacrifice of prisoners. The ritualized nature of Moche warfare is constantly reiter- ated in scenes that portray the adoration of the warrior's bundle (Kutscher 1983: abb. 278), the display of a warrior's tunic and war implements (Berrin 1997: 138, fig. 77), and the anthropomorphization of the warrior's regalia (Kutscher 1983: abb. 271). There is currently no evidence to suggest that the victims sacrificed at Huaca de la Luna were foreigners. Their apparent good health, their strength (based on the indices of muscle attachments), and the numerous old injuries suggest that they could have been part of a select group of Moche males specifi- cally trained and prepared for these ritual activities (Verano, this volume, and 1998: 161).</page><page sequence="8">7. Ceramie goblet containing traces of human blood Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin (VA-47985) Blood and Sacrifice As mentioned earlier, the main objective of battle was not to kill but to defeat opponents by capturing them and bringing them to the temple. The depiction of cactus, epiphytic plants, and what appear to be sand dunes or hills in the battle scenes has led authors to propose that these combats took place in unpopulated areas, away from human settle- ments (Alva and Donnan 1993: 129; Bawden 1996: 66; Shimada 1994: no; Wilson 1988: 338). It is not clear to me where these ritual confrontations took place. Such plants, often shown with their root systems (fig. 5 ), are also present in other contexts, and could signify something other than a geographical location. They may refer to a subterranean world, and therefore to concepts of fertility and death (Bourget 1994). Upon arrival at the temples, captured warriors were presented to high- status individuals and eventually sacrificed by having their throats cut (Benson 1972: 46). Presumably their spurting blood was col- lected in a goblet and consumed by high- ranking individuals such as those represented in the Sacrifice Ceremony. Alva and Donnan proposed that this ritual really took place: "When the Sacrifice Ceremony, with its distinct priests and symbolic elements, was first identified in Moche art in 1974, we won- dered whether this ceremony was actually enacted by the Moche or whether it was played out by deities in some mythical setting. Since the only evidence of the ceremony was in the artistic depictions, we had no way of knowing whether it was a mythical or real event. The anthropomorphized bird and ani- mal figures certainly seemed mythical, but perhaps these were artistic means to imply the supernatural aspects of real people who were enacting prescribed roles. Could it be that the Moche actually sacrificed their prisoners of war and consumed their blood? Not until the excavation of Tomb 1 [at Sipán] did we have archaeological evidence that this ceremony actually took place, with living individuals enacting the roles of the priests depicted in the art" (Alva and Donnan 1993: 141). The discoveries at Sipán and San José de Moro provided evidence that details in the depictions of the Sacrifice Ceremony, particu- larly the regalia, had close correspondences with the archaeological record. Evidence for the actual collection of blood, however, re- mained elusive and conjectural until recently. In 1996 and 1997, Margaret Newman and I selected two Moche ceramic goblets, similar in form to those represented in the Sacrifice Ceremony, from museum collections for analyses. One goblet from the Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin (fig. 7), and one from the Museo de Arqueología, Antropología e His- toria de la Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, were tested by immunological analysis. Sam- ples taken from the inside of each container showed a very strong positive reaction to human antiserum. The samples were also tested against a range of ten animal antisera, and human blood was the only positive result (Bourget and Newman 1998). We can, there- fore, assume with confidence that at least some of these cups once contained human blood. To our knowledge, it represents the first conclusive evidence that the Moche did fill goblets with human blood, possibly to be drunk by religious attendants. The scene modeled in bas-relief around the body of the Berlin vessel implies that the blood was obtained from victims captured in battle. bourget 95</page><page sequence="9">Four pairs of warriors are shown engaged in one-on-one combat. Three of the pairs are ex- changing blows to the face or the legs; in the fourth pair, one warrior is grasping his adver- sary by the hair, a sign of capture in Moche iconography (Alva and Donnan 1993: 129). I do not mean to suggest a direct relation- ship between the Sacrifice Ceremony, the goblets, and the sacrificial site at Huaca de la Luna. We currently have no evidence that these rituals were linked. On the basis of archaeological and iconographical data, it is conceivable that a number of discrete rituals with sacrificial components could have been performed by the Moche, for different pur- poses. These may include rituals relatively well known to us through iconography and at least partially through archaeology, such as the Sacrifice Ceremony, as well as others that are less well understood and documented. For example, one type of ritual, called the Moun- tain Sacrifice, is known to us only through iconography at the moment (Bourget 1995; Zighelboim 1995). Others are known to us only through archaeology, such as the El Niño-linked sacrifice at the Huaca de la Luna. Representations of this ritual have yet to be properly identified in Moche iconography. The Huaca de la Luna Sacrificial Site The Huaca de la Luna is found at the foot of Cerro Blanco, and is composed of three plat- forms linked together by a series of terraces, corridors, and plazas (Uceda, this volume). The focus of my research has been Platform II and its associated plaza, designated Plaza 3A. This area is a prolongation of the main plat- form (Platform I) toward Cerro Blanco, and was completed during one of the last archi- tectural phases of the site. Platform II and Plaza 3A represents a single architectural project constructed between the sixth and seventh centuries. Although Platform II has been badly damaged by looting activities and natural processes over the centuries, we were able to identify four tombs in this structure (fig. 2). These tombs are grouped together, on the northern side of the platform. A natural rocky outcrop is located toward the center of the complex, contiguous with the platform and the adjacent plaza. The sacrificial victims were found in the plaza, to the north and west of this feature. Over the course of three field seasons we excavated fifteen strata of human remains in the plaza, representing at least five distinct rituals. We estimate that the remains of at least seventy individuals were in this 60 m2 area. Few of the skeletons were complete,- many disarticulated body parts were scat- tered across the area. In addition to the human remains, we found fragments of at least fifty unfired clay effigies of nude males with ropes around their necks, shown seated cross-legged with their hands usually resting on their knees (fig. 8).4 Plaza 3 A provides evidence for a type of ritual that was heretofore undocumented in the archaeological record. It is now clear, however, that elements of this ritual were 8.

The left temporal lobe shows evidence of a knife wound 10. Wooden club from Tomb i, Platform II, Huaca de la Luna Museo de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo represented in Moche iconography. In this section I will discuss the physical and artifac- tual evidence discovered at Huaca de la Luna and compare it with the iconographical record. Although most of the sacrifice tools were not found in the plaza, we can infer their use through the study of the skeletal remains. Knives and clubs were among the principal tools used. Figure 9 shows the remains of the upper torso and cranium of an individual who was dispatched by a knife wound on the left temporal region,- the cut was deep enough to pierce the skull. This fatal wound was de- livered with what appears to have been a crescent-blade copper knife at least 7 cm in width. We assume knives were also used to cut throats or decapitate victims. Knives of the type and size to deliver the wound shown in Figure 9 have been found in burials at several Moche sites. These include the buri- als of two females in the urban sector of the Moche site (Chapdelaine et al. 1997: 82; Uceda and Armas 1997: 102), Tomb 1 at Sipán (Alva and Donnan 1993: 96) and the burial of a male at Dos Cabezas (Cordy- Collins, in press). Numerous representations of similar knives are seen on ceramics, in scenes of throat slashing and decapitation (see, for example, Berrin 1997: 150, no. 91). A wooden club covered with black residue was found in Tomb I, on Platform II, adjacent to Plaza 3A (fig. 10). This tomb, partly looted, contained the remains of two males, one in his sixties, the other an adolescent. Immuno- logical analysis of the residue on the club indi- cated that it had been repeatedly drenched in human blood (Bourget and Newman 1998). Approximately 70 cm in length, the club could have been used to break crania or other bones of victims. Figure 11 shows an indi- vidual with the sort of fracture that could have been inflicted by such a weapon. The sexagenarian male buried with the club could have been one of the official sacrificers asso- ciated with the plaza. Body parts were removed from the victims and scattered around the plaza, as evidenced by the disarticulated skeletal remains of heads, arms, and legs (fig. 12). This practice may also have a counterpart in iconography. Depic- tions of severed arms and legs are found on a number of ceramic vessels, including a bottle 1 1 . Cranium with evidence of a blow to the occipital region, Plaza 3 A, Huaca de la Luna BOURGET 97</page><page sequence="11">in the collections of the Museo Nacional de Antropología, Arqueología e Historia in Lima (fig. 13). In such depictions, ropes are often shown attached to disarticulated limbs and decapitated heads. In Plaza 3 A, by the wrist of a victim, we found the imprint of a rope in the hardened clay. On one side of the Lima bottle, a phallus and testicles are painted between two nude individuals with ropes around their necks. The genitals appear to have been separated from the body. This practice is, of course, much more difficult to document archaeologically. Other treatments of the body have been recorded. For example, we documented the insertion of body parts and other materials into the victims. At least four individuals were subjected to this type of activity. A rib and a human jaw were inserted respectively into the sacrum and thoracic cage of one vic- tim,- a toe was introduced into the pelvis of another, and a finger bone was forced between the ribs of a third. A rock, probably from the rocky outcrop, was tightly squeezed into the pelvis of the fourth victim (fig. 14). 5 In order to insert some of these objects, organs un- doubtedly would have to be removed first. 12. Remains of a disarticulated left arm, Plaza 3 A The victims7 genitalia may have been a pre- ferred area of torture, as underscored by a vessel found in Tomb 2 on Platform II (fig. 16). This vessel represents a seated prisoner, with zoomorphized rope (a snake) biting his penis. The image may be more than metaphor; it could signal the eventual removal of the sexual organs from the warriors. Rocks were used as weapons in the plaza and were depicted in the iconography as well. Figure 13 shows an individual on the right 13.

In Plaza 3A numerous fragments of stone, probably from the rocky outcrop itself, were used as projectiles. These were thrown at the individuals in the plaza and at the clay effigies that were scattered amongst the vic- tims. In a number of scenes in Moche ico- nography, fanged or skeletonized individuals are often shown about to hurl a stone (Donnan 1982: 120). This gesture is usually associated with funerary scenes or sacrificial rituals. Another practice carried out on the vic- tims at the Huaca de la Luna was the removal of the lower jaw. As mentioned earlier, in one instance a jaw was inserted in the thoracic cage of an individual; just to the side of him, two disarticulated lower jaws were placed next to each other, back to front (fig. 15). Jaws are often singled out in iconography. This anatomical part is also stressed in most of the clay effigies from the site. These figures have a design painted on their jaws, extending from cheek to cheek (fig. 17). In several fine- line paintings of combat and defeat, individu- als are shown with their jaw decorated. A mural found early last century on Platform III of Huaca de la Luna represents a warrior pur- sued by an animated headdress (Bonavia 1985: fig. 59b). The marks on the warrior's jaw may represent similar designs. In one final example, the base of a Mountain Sacri- fice scene from the Amano collection has been transformed into a gigantic skeletonized jaw and the victim is falling into it (Bourget 1994: fig. 3.14). Another important aspect of sacrificial practices seen in the iconography is the bourget 99</page><page sequence="13">17- Fragment of a clay effigy with a painted design on the lower jaw, Plaza 3 A Museo de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo Tomb i, we found the vertebra of an adult sea lion ( Otaria byronia), along with some sherds of domestic ceramics, in a small recess at the bottom of a posthole (fig. 18, arrow). From a contextual perspective, these elements seem to indicate that sea lions are somehow associ- ated with one of the victims of the sacrificial site, the clay effigies, and some of the activi- ties performed on the platform. A ceramic vessel in the collection of the Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin, may shed light on this association (fig. 19). The ceramic vessel represents a person strapped to a rack. The vertical and horizontal elements of the rack terminate in sea lion heads. The face and hairstyle of the prisoner in the rack is similar to those of the clay effigies from the plaza (fig. 20). When seen from the back, one can see that the victim is firmly holding the lower jaws of the sea lion heads (fig. 19). The vessel links a captured male with sea lions, lower jaws, racks, and sacrifice. removal of the skin from the face (Larco Hoy le 1966: 22). At least one individual in Plaza 3A may have had one of these "face lifts," judging from the cut marks on the fore- head and on the right orbit. To a certain extent, the physical evidence of sacrificial practices appears to match closely those repre- sented in the iconography, but ritual sacri- fices are more than just manipulations of the body. These physical practices were em- bedded in a complex web of beliefs. Turning to the symbolic aspects of human sacrifice, I will now focus on the relationship between the victims of Plaza 3A and sea lions and sarcosaprophagous insects. Sea Lions There seems to be a symbolic linkage between the victims of the plaza, an individual buried in Tomb 1 on Platform II, and sea lions. The canine tooth of a sea lion pup was found rest- ing on the sternum of an individual in the plaza, the same individual who had a fragment of the rocky outcrop tightly inserted into his pelvis (fig. 14). This canine was not part of a necklace, but had been intentionally deposited on the body. Just next to this individual was a clay effigy with an image of a sea lion painted on its chest.

Nevertheless, despite the damage to the platform, we have been able to identify four postholes, three of them along the north side of the platform, and one near the south wall. A speculative, but intriguing possibility is that some of these postholes served to anchor wooden sacrificial racks. If this was the case, the sea lion vertebra deposited in the posthole could fulfil a métonymie function and under- score the symbolic relationship between sacri- ficial victims and sea lions. The location of the posthole beside Tomb i may be significant. To continue in this speculative vein for a moment, it is tempting to suggest that sacrifices involving a rack were performed during the burial of high- ranking individuals such as the occupant of Tomb i, the fellow with the bloody club. Christopher Donnan and Donna McClelland (1979) noted similar racks in the depictions of the Burial Theme, but the vertical and hori- zontal elements of the rack in this scene ter- minate in black vultures ( Coragyps atratus). Similar racks are also represented in front of a stepped platform (Donnan 1978: 81, fig. 137). These racks clearly seem to be associated with funerary rituals, human sacrifice, and ceremonial architecture. Furthermore, the Berlin vase (figs. 19), stylistically dated to Moche IV, could represent a form of pars pro toto for the Burial Theme, imagery which is more commonly associated with the Moche V period. Donnan (1978: 172) has shown that Moche artists could break down complex themes into constituent parts, and choose to represent only one or two aspects of a larger scene. These isolated subjects, usually 20.

Stirrup-spout bottle in the shape of a warrior with conical helmet and zoomorphic club Museo Nacional de Antropología, Arqueología e Historia, Lima (C-03244) rendered in three-dimensional form, could stand for the larger theme. A stirrup-spout vessel found in Tomb i also appears to be associated with the theme of sea lions (fig. 21). The modeled figure on the vessel is a seated warrior, shown wearing a conical helmet and holding a bulbous club. This type of club is often shown in hunting scenes, including deer, fox, and sea lion hunts. In a fine-line depiction of a sea lion hunt (fig. 23), the sea lions are clubbed in the face, in the same manner that warriors are in other painted scenes. The hunter on the left of Fig- ure 23 is depicted with a black design on his jaw. Alongside this hunter, on the very far left of the scene, a female is seated in front of a small structure, preparing funerary offerings. The sea lion hunters wear headdresses that are typical for fishermen in Moche maritime scenes. In a depiction of a sea lion hunt on a vessel in the Museo Arqueológico Rafael Lareo Herrera, Lima, one hunter also carries a small 23.

In one painting known as the Revolt of the Objects, sea lions are associ- ated with anthropomorphized warrior regalia taking captives (Quilter 1990: fig. 3). In a vessel from the Lima Museo Nacional de Antropología, Arqueología e Historia (fig. 22), the warrior's club terminates in a sea lion's head. He also has a round shield resting just in front of him. This conflates the hunter and the hunted; the club and the sea lion. It is not possible at the moment to demonstrate that sea lions were perceived as surrogate victims and were symbolically associated with the sacrificed warriors of the plaza. More research will be needed, but could it be possi- ble that it is instead the hunters themselves that are associated with the victims of the plaza? Indeed, the hair of the hunters is disheveled much like representations of cap- tured warriors. One other inconclusive but intriguing detail is a rounded depression on the earlobes of the clay effigies. Such a mark may indicate that these effigies represent in considerable detail the identifying elements of hunters and warriors - the depression un- doubtedly connotes where an individual of such status would have worn tubular ear- plugs, that is, would have worn them before he was captured. The victims depicted in the sacrificial rack (fig. 19) and on vessels found in Tomb 2 (fig. 16) also have similar depres- sions in their earlobes. A number of funerary contexts reinforce the mortuary and liminal associations of sea lions, one of the larger marine mammals found off the coast of Peru (Bourget 1990). At Huaca de la Cruz in the Virú Valley, a large sea lion effigy jar was buried with the atten- dant of the Warrior Priest burial (Strong and Evans 1952: 151). In the tomb of the female identified by Daniel Arsenault as linked to the Sacrifice Ceremony, two polished pebbles were found at the bottom of a flaring bowl (Strong and Evans 1952: 147). This tomb was situated just a few meters from the Warrior Priest burial. Marine biologists have noted that pebbles are swallowed by sea lions (Schweigger 1947: 210), and the Moche clearly knew this as well. Donnan has pointed out that sea lions are frequently represented with stones in their mouths (1978: 136). Figure 24, a potato effigy jar, shows a sea lion with two pebbles in its mouth. A number of ceramics in the form of sea lion heads have been found in burials at Huaca de la Luna and Huaca Cao Viejo (Donnan and Mackey 1978: 113, 187,- Franco, Gálvez, and Vásquez 1998: 15). At Pacatnamú, a site in the Jequetepeque Valley, a boot-shaped cham- ber filled with nine cane coffins contained the offering of a sea lion cranium (Hecker and Hecker 1992: 45, Tomb E I; Ubbelohde-Doering 1 983 : 53). Elsewhere in the Jequetepeque Valley, a sea lion scapula was found in a burial at San José de Moro (Donnan 1995: 147). Two gilded copper beads with sea lion facial BOURGET 103</page><page sequence="17">features were recovered from the looted tomb at Sipán; a necklace consisting of ten smaller sea lion beads was excavated from Tomb 3 as well (Alva 1988: 511; Alva and Donnan 1993: 200).6 Sea lions may have been associated with the victims of the sacrificial plaza at Huaca de la Luna because during El Niño events the Moche had to compete against these marine mammals for diminished resources. Sea lions also destroy fishing nets and poach fish in the process (Schweigger 1947: 209). Sea lions, sym- bolically speaking, are also liminal creatures. As their very name implies, they cross terri- torial boundaries of land and sea: they swim like fish, yet are covered with fur (Bourget 1994). This liminality probably had im- portant symbolic ramifications in Moche beliefs about sacrifice, death, and the afterlife. Sarcosaprophagus Insects Most of the clay effigies from the plaza had designs painted on their lower jaws (fig. 17). Painted jaws are also indicated in fine-line depictions of warriors taking prisoners (Alva and Donnan 1993: 128, fig. 137). The larger scale of the designs on the plaza effigies, however, allows us to study these designs in greater detail. The lower jaws of the effigies are painted with a band of oval-shaped motifs, extending from ear to ear. The oval-shaped motifs appear to have heads and two appen- dages. I propose that these represent muscoid flies emerging from their pupal cases. Such a symbol would reiterate the transforming aspects of bodily decay, literally through insect infestation, that occurs in the liminal state of death. Muscoid flies are usually the first to detect the presence of death. The flies will rapidly alight on the corpse and lay eggs or living larvae. The eggs will then hatch into larval forms and undergo successive molts before entering the inactive pupal stage (Smith 1986). The pupa is simply the hardened outer skin of the last larval stage, and the adult will develop inside this protective skin. In order to break free from the pupal case, the adult fly, while still inside the case, begins to fill with fluid a structure on top of its head, just between the eyes. The inflated head breaks the end of the pupal case and the fly begins to extract itself with its anterior legs. Thus the 104 BOURGET 25. Stirrup-spout bottle with depictions of skeletons and a fly Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin (VA-62199) design on the chin precisely depicts the anteri- or legs and the inflated head of the fly, with what appears to be an eye in the center, but which is more likely to be the large organ used to pop open the extremity of the pupal case. Textual sources from the early colonial period and other evidence suggest that the soul took on the form of a fly after death. Anne-Marie Hocquenghem (1981) has sug- gested that the painting on a vessel in the collection of the Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin (fig. 25) represents a "■ welcoming party " of skeletons greeting the arrival of the "soul" of a deceased individual, which takes on the form of a fly. The fly is located on top of the body of the vessel, just under the stirrup spout. In the Huarochiri Manuscript, a docu- ment dating to the end of the sixteenth cen- tury, flies and maggots are associated with the vital essence of the dead. Great caution must be exerted when using documents of a</page><page sequence="18">26. Stirrup-spout bottle in the form of a human head Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin (VA-32567) later period in the discussion of Moche iconography, but in this case, it is worth men- tioning, as it shows the degree of pragmatism that may be part of the symbolic domain of ancient Andean cultures: "In very ancient times, they say, when a person died, people laid the body out until five days had gone by. The dead person's spirit which is the size of a fly, would fly away say- ing, 'Sio!' When it flew away, people said, 'Now he's going away to see Paria caca, our maker and our sustainer'" (Salomon and Urioste 1991: 129). Leaving the body exposed for five days would indeed have attracted a number flies, and it is likely that larvae or maggots could have been seen feeding, especially around ori- fices of the body such as the eyes, nose, or mouth: "At Yaru Tini, as the sun was rising, the dead spirit would arrive. In the old times, two or three big flies - people call them llacsa anapalla - would light on the garment she brought. She'd sit there for a long while. As soon as those maggots called huancoy worms left the corpse, the woman would say, 'Come on, let's go to the village.' And as if to say, This is him,' she'd pick up a small pebble and come back" (Salomon and Urioste 1991: 1 30-1 31). In a footnote to this text, Frank Salomon and George Urioste mention that the huan- coy could refer to maggots: "The point would then be that the cadaver must be left long enough to breed worms so its anima can emerge and escape in the form of flies" (1991: 131). This process would take at least eigh- teen to twenty days, from the time of the deposit of eggs or larvae to the departure of the adult flies. The removal of the jaw of some victims in the plaza might in some fashion have been seen to accelerate the liberation of the soul or anima from the rotting corpse. A portrait vessel in the collection of the Berlin Museum für Völkerkunde (fig. 26) shows painted designs on the lower jaw and chin similar to those on the clay effigies of the plaza.7 We can see a similar string of flies emerging from their pupae in association with a different sort of insect, shown immediately below the line of pupae, above the pair of figures with headdresses. I propose that these represent a species of carrion beetle, another insect that feeds on dead tissue. At this moment it is not possible to determine the exact species, but they could represent members of the Histeri- dae or Dermestidae families commonly found on corpses in the later stages of decompo- sition (Faulkner 1986; Smith 1986). Larvae of dermestids do not occur before the body is dry. Larvae and adults feed on dry skin, hair, and other dry dead organic matter. The repre- sentation of these insects and the integration of them into the symbolic domain of the Moche reiterate once more their pervasive interest in the human body and in the processes of death and decay in all its details. I suspect that the victims of Plaza 3 A were intentionally left exposed for the flies to com- plete the ritual process. The departure of hun- dreds of new flies would have signaled the end of the sacrificial ceremony. The practice of intentionally leaving disar- ticulated corpses to rot in the open air has been noted elsewhere on the north coast of Peru. During the Lambayeque occupation of BOURGET IO5</page><page sequence="19">Pacatnamú (the cultural phase following the Moche occupation of the site), fourteen males were sacrificed and left exposed for some time in a trench alongside the northern en- trance of one of the principle complexes (Ver- ano 1986). Although these sacrifices appear to have been conducted for different reasons, striking similarities can be seen between this context and the Huaca de la Luna sacrificial site. All of the victims were between fifteen and thirty-five years of age. Further analyses of their skeletal material revealed that they were robust individuals, and a number of them showed evidence of old injuries. Verano (1986: 133) suggests that these victims were soldiers who had been taken prisoners of war. Some dismemberment also took place, although to a lesser extent than at Huaca de la Luna. Based on entomological evidence from the site, the mutilated corpses were left exposed for a number of weeks, if not months (Faulkner 1986). Returning to the Museo Nacional de Antropología, Arqueología e Historia vessel (fig. 24), we can begin to appreciate more fully the complexity of the iconography of this piece and see the linkage of the victims of Plaza 3 A, sea lions, and flies. Two sea lions are modeled and painted on the body of the vessel. One is visible on the side of the body of the vessel, his tail and flippers rendered two-dimensionally and his head three-dimen- sionally. The second takes the general form of the potato effigy, with his head on the top of the body of the vessel. He is shown with his upper lip cut out, two pebbles in his mouth, and the characteristic designs painted on his lower jaw. The very shape of the jar, a potato, further emphasizes the association with the earth and the subterranean (Bourget 1990). Moche Rituals of Human Sacrifice To the extent that we understand Moche ritual behavior, human sacrifice appears to have been an important and widespread com- ponent of Moche ritual life. Sacrificial prac- tices involved a complex liturgy and were central to Moche religious activities, both in a physical sense, at the site of Moche, and in a conceptual sense. The various types of sacri- ficial rituals - those sacrifices that occurred at the moment of interment of important individuals, as well as larger sacrifices carried 106 BOURGET out for specific community purposes - were so widely represented and performed that we must assume that they were not rare or iso- lated occurrences, but formed a significant component of Moche religious life. I suspect that the sacrificial site in the plaza of Huaca de la Luna is not the only one of its type and that others will be found in the future. In essence and transcendence the sacrificial site of Huaca de la Luna is inti- mately associated with the El Niño phenome- non and, by extension, the world of the sea - the destruction associated with El Niño is first and foremost associated with the chang- ing sea current. Could the high walls of the plaza have contained a symbolic microcosm of the sea? Was the sacrifice of warriors in pools of mud during torrential rains symboli- cally related to sea lion hunts? The practice of human sacrifice has pro- found implications for the social fabric and religious praxis of a society. In Moche cul- ture, human sacrifice permeated most of their religious and symbolic performances. The social and political implications of this behavior are still poorly understood. More sacrificial contexts and more research will be needed before we fully comprehend the rami- fications of these rituals not only for the Moche but for the Andean world as a whole.</page><page sequence="20">NOTES The Plaza 3A and Platform II Project was made possi- ble by the generous support of The British Academy, The Leverhulme Trust and the Sainsbury Research Unit for the Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Ameri- cas of the University of East Anglia.

Great care must be exerted when determining if these accompanying burials were those of sacrificed individuals. At Sipán, for example, the disarticulated remains of three women found in Tomb 1 indicate that these were more likely secondary burials, perhaps relatives of the principal individual in the tomb who had died at a different time and were added to the tomb (Verano 1995: 197]. 2. "Backflap" is a term used to refer to a thin sheet of metal, often ornamented at the top in bas-relief and inlay, and terminating in a curved edge. Backflaps were shown suspended from the waists of warriors in Moche iconography (see also Alva, this volume). 3. For a detailed analysis of ritual warfare and deer hunting, see Donnan (1997). 4. This number was arrived at by calculating the minimum number of penises, or MNP. 5 . The manner in which these items were tightly embedded in the skeletons suggests that these were intentional placements by humans rather than the accidental scatter left by animal scavengers or the shifting of remains after the sacrificial events. Although small rocks were used as projectiles in the plaza, the large rock in the pelvis of the fourth individual is probably not the result of this type of action. The rock is too tightly fitted in the cavity, and there is no bone breakage as one would expect from the force of such a blow. 6. Alva has suggested that these were faces of felines, but on the basis of the form of the face, the shape of the mouth, the canines, the nose, and the eyes, I would argue that not only are these facial features consistent with those of living sea lions ( Otaria byronia ), but also with the way these marine mammals are represented on the ceramics. Further- more, in this same tomb, these effigies are not the only ones that can be associated with the world of the sea. For example, elements associated with marine birds, octopus, crab, and two species of fish have been identified. 7. Christopher Donnan (this volume) makes a com- pelling case for the association between some of these vessels and the depiction of sacrificial victims in Moche iconography. Although more research is needed, the possible relationship between these por- trait vessels and the clay effigies found in the site would reinforce the hypothesis that the human victims were a select group of individuals.
