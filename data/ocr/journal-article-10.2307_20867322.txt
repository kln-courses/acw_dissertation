<plain_text><page sequence="1">1 GENERAL LINGUISTICS By John N. Green, University of York i. Miscellanies, Periodicals The extent of the 'information explosion' in linguistics is vividly reflected in the healthy, not to say hyperactive, state of the periodical market. No less than twenty new titles have accrued to the list in the last five years and others have sub stantially increased, sometimes doubled, their output (most recently Li, JPR, Brain and Language). By these heady standards, this year's crop is modest: Semantikos, ed. R. Zuber, Paris, has a philosophical/pragmatic outlook, while Verbum, Revue de Linguistique, ed. H. Nais, Nancy U.P., 's'assigne la vise*e la plus ^cleetique' and will devote every third issue to one particular theme. The Nordic Journal of Linguistics, ed. E. Hovdhaugen, Oslo U.P., is a transmutation of NTS, coinciding with the founding of a Nordic Association of Linguists, of which it becomes the official organ. Commemorative issues incl.: SL, 32 as cSign and sound; studies presented to Bertil Malmberg on the occasion of his sixty-fifth birthday, 22 April 1978'; and LSp, 21, no. 4, ed. A. S. Abramson, as 'Essays on the production and perception of speech in honour of Dennis B. Fry'. 2. General Approaches Almost a decade's work by a sizeable research team on the Stanford Project on Language Universals has culminated in the production of four impressive vols, Universals of Human Language, ed. J. H. Greenberg et aL, Stanford U.P., containing in all 45 arts, some previously publ. in the Project's working papers (WPLU) and others newly commissioned. Vol. 1 covers 'Method and theory', and the others in turn 'Phonology', 'Word structure' and 'Syntax' (discussed below). Among the penetrating methodological discussions on the identification and correct matching of putative universals, Greenberg's 1</page><page sequence="2">2 General Linguistics own arts must be singled out: 'Typology and] cross-linguistic generalizations', 'Diachrony, synchrony and language univer sals', vol. i, pp. 33~59&gt; 61-91. Linguistic Theory and Psychological Reality, eds M. Halle et al., Cambridge (Mass.), MIT Press, is a coll. of 9 papers critically examining TG in the light of what a child could learn and what a competent adult could know about language; rewarding, though technical, is J. Bresnan's 'A realistic transformational grammar', pp. 1-59. Not everyone, however, agrees on the axioms: B. Inhelder, 'Language and thought: some remarks on Chomsky and Piaget', JPR, 7:263-77, and G. R. Sampson, 'Linguistic universals as evidence for empiricism', JL, 14: 183-206, both argue against Chomsky's 'innateness' hypothesis. The Linguistic Association of Canada and the U.S.A., originally a group of linguists disenchanted with ? or never admitted to ? the magic TG circle, has clearly come of age: The Fourth LACUS Forum 1977, ed. M. Paradis, Columbia (SC), Hornbeam Press, is a solid coll. of 63 arts showing a distinct bias towards developmental psychology and bilingualism (for a shrewd evaluation of earlier years, see F. W. Householder's rev. of the first Forum Proc: L, 54:170-76). Paradis also ed. Aspects of Bilingualism, ib., a LACUS coll. promoted as a course book, but having an unmistakeable affinity to the conference 'paravolumes' of Chicago fame. A set of rather metatheoretical essays by a group of German scholars is as interesting for the light it sheds on current trends in German linguistics as for its ostensible contents: Sprachdynamik und Sprachstruktur, eds C. Habel and S. Kanngiesser, Tubingen, Niemeyer. S. C. Dik contributes a refreshing manifesto for Functional Grammar (NHLS, 37), Amsterdam, N.Holland, while Z. Harris sketches a new 'Grammar on mathematical principles', JL, 14:1-20. J. Aitchison extensively revises her [Teach Yourself] Linguistics, London, Hodder and Stoughton, and the year's statutory Introduction to Generative-Transformational Syntax ? rather well set-out and exemplified ? comes from C. L. Baker, Englewood Cliffs, Prentice-Hall; both have reasonable sections on universal grammar. 3. History of Linguistics The centenary of the Neogrammarian movement is marked by a</page><page sequence="3">General Linguistics 3 special no. of TPS, concerned with the lasting achievements of the 'paradigm', its igth-c. context, and some of its lesser known preoccupations ? analogy, dialect studies and rejection of the anthropomorphic images of 'youth' and 'decay' in language history, documented esp. in: R. H. Robins, 'The Neogrammarians and their nineteenth-century predecessors', pp. 1-16, and A. M. Davies, 'Analogy, segmentation and the early Neogrammarians', pp. 36-60. Two books of selected readings, each with reasonable stage-setting by the ed., cover both the Neogrammarians and their detractors: ed. T. H. Wilbur, The Lautgesetz-Controversy: A Documentation {1885-86), Amsterdam, Benjamins, 1977, and ed. H. H. Christmann, Sprachwissenschaft des 19. Jahrhunderts, Darmstadt, Wissen schaftliche Buchhandlung, 1977. A different celebration appears as Sound, Sign and Meaning, Quinquagenary of the Prague Linguistic Circle, ed. L. Matejka, Ann Arbor, Michigan U.P., among whose 27 arts M. Halle, 'Roman Jakobson's contribu tion to the modern study of speech sounds', pp. 79-100, and E. Stankiewicz, 'Prague School morphophonemics', pp. 101-18, are of special interest. Rather a debunking exercise is R. J. Kispert, 'Sir William Jones: a new perspective on the origin and background of his "Common Source"', Georgetown Papers on Languages and Linguistics, 14 :i? 68, claiming that a very indirect influence on Schlegel was the only practical effect of J.'s supposed discovery. J.'s originality is again questioned, by J. Fellman, 'Semitic linguistics and Indo-European comparative and historical grammar', LingH, 206:51-53; his ideas derive, it is now alleged, via the Dutch Orientalist A. Schultens (1686-1750) from a much earlier Semitic source, esp. H. Ludolf (1624-1704). Lang. 49, ed. C. Normand, is devoted to 'Saussure et la linguis tique pre-saussurienne'; T. Janson contrasts 'Saussure and Chomsky on the goals and methods of linguistics', SL, 32: 111-18, while C. Vallini puzzles over the apparent discrepancy between S.'s dismissive comments on etymology in the Cours and his own meticulous etymological vignettes, 'Ancora sul metodo di F. de Saussure: 1'etimologia', SSL, 18:75-128. Finally, W. Haas's pi,thy and personal view of'Linguistics 1930-1980', JL, 14:293-308, emphasizes the similarity between early TG and its spurned Bloomfieldian forbears, esp. their common</page><page sequence="4">4 General Linguistics preoccupation with formal mechanisms and phobias about meaning. 4. Historical Linguistics Mechanisms of Syntactic Change, ed. C. N. Li, Texas U.P., 1977, assembles 14 conference papers, most of high quality, dealing principally with reanalysis, ergativity, clitics and word order changes. N. S. Baron, Language Acquisition and Historical Change (NHLS, 36), Amsterdam, N.Holland, 1977, is much less general than its title suggests; after some placatory remarks on the obvious links between change and children's learning errors, it settles to a detailed examination of paraphrastic causatives in English. Documenting 'The fate of morphological complexity in language death: evidence from East Sutherland Gaelic', L, 54:590-609, N. C. Dorian tests the hypothesis that a language being deserted by its speakers manifests the same kind of morphological reduction that is associated with pidgins; not so, she concludes ? there is reduction, but much less of it and functionally of a different kind. Another set of conference papers appear as Recent Develop ments in Historical Phonology, ed. J. Fisiak, The Hague, Mouton, in which M. B. Harris uses Romance data to disentangle some possible causes of typological drift: 'The inter-relationship between phonological and grammatical change', pp. 159-72. Announced from Pennsylvania U.P. is a new coll. of*Readings in Historical Phonology, eds. P. Baldi and R. N. Werth. A detailed study by B. Khrishnamurti, 'Areal and lexical diffusion of sound change: evidence from Dravidian', L, 54:1-20, casts new light on an old problem, showing that in a well-defined dialect group a supposedly shared rule affected less than a dozen items at the proto stage, but continued for two millenia [!] to extend at different rates through the eligible lexical items of the diverging dialects, thus contributing to their differentia tion. Also noteworthy are: R. Ambrosini's contrastive survey of 'Alcuni aspetti della linguistica indo-europea attuale: la ricostruzione tra funzionalismo e generativismo', SSL, 18: 25~74&gt; M. Cooley, 'Phonological constraints and sound changes', Gl, 12:125-36; and a well-illustrated scrutiny of a neglected theme, J. Levitt, 'The influence of orthography on phonology', LingH, 208:43-67.</page><page sequence="5">General Linguistics 5 5. Phonetics and Phonology What should have been a most useful reference work, the 400 entry Biographical Dictionary of the Phonetic Sciences, ed. A. J. Bronstein et aL, N.York, Lehman College Press, must in fact be treated with great caution since, aside from the dismal standard of proofreading, it contains numerous and sometimes bizarre errors of fact. P. Lieberman's Speech Physiology and Acoustic Phonetics, N.York, Macmillan, 1977, is a lively advanced course-book, prepared to champion some probable but not yet proven hypotheses (esp. Stevens's 'quantal states' theory). In 'Zur Problematik der sogenannten Implosive', Phon, 35: 241-83, W. Merlingen claims these sounds, based essentially on swallowing mechanisms, represent 'one of the most ancient and archaic manners of articulation'. Perceptual studies incl. E. Fischer-Jorgensen, 'On the universal character of phonetic symbolism with special reference to vowels', SL, 32:80-90; and W. M. Clarke, 'The relationship between subjective measures of nasality and measures of the oral and nasal sound pressure ratio', LSp, 21:69-75 ? in brief, very little correlation, although non-linguistic factors like the sex of the subject are relevant. Experimental phonetics is represented by B. L. Smith, 'Effects of place of articulation and vowel environment on "voiced" stop consonant production', Gl, 12:163-75; J. Gauf fin and J. Sundberg, 'Pharyngeal constriction', Phon, 35: 157-68, largely verifying by means of the fiberscope previous X-ray investigations of changes in larynx shape during back vowel production; and a broader-based plea for greater acceptance and use of experimental results among non phoneticians, B. Lindblom, 'Phonetic aspects of linguistic explanation', SL, 32:137-53. L. would presumably be delighted with a rigorous testing of the well-known claim that Punjabi phonemic tone is a residual effect of the loss of certain consonants: E. T. Purcell et aL, 'A before and after for tono genesis', Phon, 35:284-93, find the case proven. There has been a welcome surge of interest in supraseg mentals. Studies in Stress and Accent, ed. L. M. Hyman, Los Angeles, Southern California U.P., 1977, assembles 15 papers from a 1976 symposium, with a marked experimental flavour, W. A. Lea's title 'Acoustic correlates of stress and juncture',</page><page sequence="6">6 General Linguistics pp. 83-119, aptly summarizing the major concern (on which see also C. Adams and R. R. Munro, 'In search of the acoustic correlates of stress', Phon, 35:125-56). D. J. Napoli ed. five case studies on Elements of Tone, Stress and Intonation, Washington D.C., Georgetown U.P., while V. A. Fromkin provides a larger coll. of essays, *Tone: A Linguistic Survey, N.York, Academic Press. Worthy of mention are: R. L.Trammell,'The psychological reality of underlying forms and rules for stress', JPR, 7:79-94; I. Fonagy, 'A new method of investigating the perception of prosodic features', LSp, 21:34-49 ? a hymn of praise to the laryngograph; and D. R. Ladd, Jr, 'Stylized intonation', L, 54:517-40, which groups the well-known English 'stepping down' sequence among other stylized con tours unusual in their level-pitch ending and shows reason to prefer British-style nuclear tones, rather than whole-sentence tones, as units of analysis. Likely to remain for many years the standard reference work is Phonology, vol. 2 of Universals of Human Language (see p. 1, ?2, above), with 13 typological-comparative arts planned to cover most segmental, suprasegmental and process phenomena. In a major review of articulatory and acoustic correlates of 'Vowel features', L, 54:541-63, M. Lindau accords High and Back special status because of their quasi-universality and demon strates that others must be accepted as multivalued. L. A. Becker proposes tighter definition for 'The feature(s) [grave]', JPh, 6:319-25, while M. Haggard casts doubt on the unity of process in 'The devoicing of voiced fricatives', JPh, 6:95-102. Phonological theory increasingly presents an image of dis integration. Put forward rather blandly as modifications to the MIT generative model are Current Phonological Theories, ed. D. A. Dinnsen, Bloomington, Indiana U.P., though in fact several proposals are radical, inch D.'s own, also illustrated in a points-scoring manner in D. A. Dinnsen and F. R. Eckman, 'Some substantive universals in atomic phonology', Li, 45: 1-14. In-house discussion incl. J. Rubach, 'Non-uniqueness in phonology', Li, 44:49-66 and K. L. Robinson, 'Generative phonology and phonological identification', JPh, 6:203-11, both on the mismatch of GP and native-speaker intuitions; M. Guerssel, dealing with a problem of rule interaction by means of 'A condition on assimilation rules', LA, 4:225-54;</page><page sequence="7">General Linguistics 7 and a vigorous four-cornered debate provoked by Vago's work on vowel harmony (YWML, 38:6), LingI, 9:89-125. D. Stampers theories on the acquisition of phonology receive a boost from N. J. Macari, 'Some psychological evidence for natural phonological processes', JPh, 6:103-26, but S. Hellberg sounds a note of caution to the naturalists: his 'Unnatural phonology', JL, 14:157-77, a minute investigation of one tiny rule in Swedish, concludes that synchronic 'natural' rules in language arise from a variety of causes and cannot necessarily be ascribed to diachronic pressure from natural phonetic processes. Work in a very different tradition incl. C. Hagege, 'Intonation, fonctions syntaxiques, chaine-systerne, et universaux des langues', BSLP, 73, no. 1:1-48, an attempt to link intonation to syntagmatic grammatical structure; and E. W. Roberts's retrospective assessment of 'Perspectives in prosodic phonology: 1?J. R. Firth', LingH, 206:5-46 ? admiring, in parts, but ending with the view that F.'s insistence on total contextualization leads more readily to 'a more imaginative phonetics than a phonological theory'. 6. Syntax and Semantics The eight essays of Syntactic Typology. Studies in the Phenomenology of Language, ed. W. P. Lehmann, Austin, Texas U.P., provide one detailed example of each of the major types (OV, VSO, SVO, S-final), together with a section on 'Ergativity' by B. Comrie and masterly preface and conclusion by Lehmann himself covering the implications of typological research for descriptive and historical linguistics. Other cross-language studies inch: A. Hochster, 'Order and degree of fusion in causatative structures', Gl, 12:39-57; G. Lazard, 'filaments d'une typologie des structures d'actance: structures ergatives, accusatives et autres', BSLP, 73, no. 1:49-84; and E. A. Moravcsik, 'On the distribution of ergative and accusative patterns', Li, 45:233-79, showing that the two types are not mutually exclusive so that traces of the one can usually be found even in language having an overwhelming preference for the other. Recent Transformational Studies in European Languages, ed. S. J. Keyser, Cambridge (Mass.), MIT Press, contains six high quality arts with a clear trace-theory flavour. Working from a</page><page sequence="8">8 General Linguistics similar position, G. M. Horn argues that the advent of traces enables TG to dispense with the troublesome cycle: Towards a More Adequate Definition of the Notion of Transformation, Edmon ton, Linguistic Research Inc. A root-and-branch attack on trace theory coupled with propaganda for the [fairly new] arc pair grammar is launched by P. M. Postal and G. K. Pullum, 'Traces and the description of English complementizer con traction5, LingI, 9:1-29, but two of the intended victims reply disdainfully: N. Chomsky and H. Lasnik, 'A remark on con traction', ib., 268-74. Revisions of a slightly less drastic kind are proposed by M. K. Brame, 'The Base hypothesis and the spelling prohibition', LA, 4:1-30, such that transformations would be shorn of the power to 'spell out' morphological material thus forcing many more operations to be accomplished by the Base; a book, Base Generated Syntax, seems imminent. Meanwhile M. B. Kac proposes to abolish deep structure and transformations in the usual sense, substituting a twin (cate gorical-cum-relational) specification of sentences: Corepresenta tion of Grammatical Structure, London, Croom Helm. J. A. Hawkins, Definiteness and Indefiniteness. A study in reference and grammaticality prediction, London, Croom Helm, uses a thoroughgoing analysis of English articles to buttress a theory of semantic syntax and motivates 'ungrammaticality' in terms of the incompatibility of semantic primes. TL, 5, no. 1, ed. M. Gross, has eight discussion papers on 'Logically-based syntax versus autonomous generative syntax', among which should be mentioned: G. Fauconnier, 'Is there a linguistic level of logical representation?', and E. L. Keenan, 'Logical semantics and universal grammar', TL, 5:31-49 and 83 107 respectively. On similar themes are: W. S. Cooper's attempted synthesis, Foundations of Logico-Linguistics, Dordrecht, Reidel, and * Studies in Formal Semantics. Intensionality, Temporality, Negation (NHLS, 35), eds F. Guenther and C. Rohrer, Amster dam, N.Holland. Three exemplary arts use the philosophical/ logical approach to elucidate hitherto particularly intractable syntactic problems: J. A. Edmondson and F. Plank, 'Great expectations: an intensive self analysis', Language and Philosophy, 2:373-413, making use of Keenan's observations on subjects to analyse intensifiers; D. T. Langendoen, 'The logic of reciprocity', LingI, 9:177-97, stressing the links between</page><page sequence="9">General Linguistics 9 reciprocals and other plural relational sentences; and J. Haiman, 'Conditionals are topics', L, 54:564-89, basing his argument ? and indeed a whole new discovery procedure ? on cross-linguistic correspondences in the morphological marking of these types of construction, previously thought to be unrelated. Pragmatics (Syntax and Semantics, 9), ed. P. Cole, N.York, Academic Press, has a dozen papers around the themes of referential opacity, negation, anaphora and conversational implicature. J. Hinds ed. a more specialized coll. on Anaphora in Discourse [exemplified mainly from Far Eastern languages], Edmonton, Linguistic Research Inc. LBer, 58, ed. A. von Stechow, is devoted to 'Pragmatik und Gesprachsanalyse', incl. a programmatic schema from G. Gazdar for 'Eine pragmatisch semantische Mischtheorie der Bedeutung', LBer, 58:5-17. 7. Structure of the Lexicon Word Structure, vol. 3 of Universals of Human Language (see p. 1, ?2, above) is clearly an all-the-rest assemblage of affixal mor phology, derivation, closed word sets (pronoun systems) and shorter phrasal units incl. idioms; most of the arts are useful and informative ? esp. Y. Malkiel, 'Derivational categories', pp. 125-49 and E. C. Traugott, 'On the expression of spatio temporal relations', pp. 369-400 ? but the evident absence of cohesion detracts from the overall impression. An important art. by P. Kay and C. K. McDaniel, 'The linguistic significance of the meanings of basic color terms', L, 54:610-46, seeks to derive semantic universals from the order in which languages lexicalize colour terms, an order corresponding to the structure and function of the visual system, which in turn provides evidence against the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Other note worthy arts incl.: R. Zimmer, 'Contribution a la theorie des lacunes linguistiques', FLin, 11, 1977:1-12; W. T. Gordon, 'Morphosemantics; a neglected chapter in linguistics', Gl, 12:3-15, an updated consideration of what used to be called 'phonaesthemes'; and a fascinating study of metaphorical extension among tightly-knit adjective sets by A. Lehrer, 'Structures of the lexicon and transfer of meaning', Li, 45: 95-123.</page><page sequence="10">10 General Linguistics N. R. Norrick marshalls a cogent case for distinguishing, on the grounds of their very different presuppositional structure, several types of factive predicates ? particularly emotive and evaluative versus cognitive adjectives: Factive Adjectives and the Theory ofFactivity (LA, 64), Tubingen, Niemeyer. Also using the generative semantic framework is J. N. Levi, . The Syntax and Semantics of Complex Nominals, N.York, Academic Press. Despite such efforts, the MIT 'interpretivist' view of the lexicon is certainly gaining ground; among several data analyses we may cite T. Roeper and M. E. A. Siegel, 'A lexical transformation for verbal compounds', LingI, 9:199-260, and J. R. Hust, 'Lexical redundancy rules and the unpassive construction', LA, 4: 61-89. Furthermore, historical evidence of analogy clearly supports the extreme view that allomorphs should be separately stored and not derived by productive rule, according to P. Tiersma, 'Bidirectional levelling as evidence for relational rules', Li, 45:65-77. It is a vexed issue, difficult to test empiric ally ? a recent attempt to do so, D. G. MacKay, 'Derivational rules and the internal lexicon', JVLVB, 17:61-71, seems to me suspect in both design and inference: the observed correlation of reaction time and derivational complexity does not prove subjects were delayed by the application of derivational rules; the extra phonological difference could just as well have hindered their search in a separate-entry lexicon. 8. Language in Society The Labovian research paradigm is well represented by Sociolinguistic Patterns in British English, ed. P. Trudgill, London, Arnold, a set of case studies on variation in urban speech with an overview by T., 'Sociolinguistics and sociolinguistics', distinguishing sometimes sardonically the properly 'linguistic' variety exemplified here from those with different methods and aspirations, notably 'sociology of language' and 'ethno methodology'. Similar in orientation are: B. R. Lavandera, 'Where does the sociolinguistic variable stop?', LSo, 7: 171-82, which argues that different rates of occurrence of meaningful elements (i.e. in morphology, syntax, lexis) must be distinguished from true variables in phonology; and A. S. Kroch, 'Towards a theory of social dialect variation', LSo, 7:</page><page sequence="11">General Linguistics ii 17-36, which seeks to codify what has long been known to historical linguists ? that prestige varieties have systematic phonological differences from non-elite speech (often the result of resistance to phonetic change), and that the cause is not linguistic but ideological, prestige groups wishing to 'mark themselves off symbolically as distinct from the groups they dominate'. To be welcomed is an interdisciplinary reader, leaning more towards social psychology than linguistics: Language, Ethnicity and Inter group Relations, ed. H. Giles, London, Academic Press. In a rather different tradition is M. Saville-Troike ed., Lin guistics and Anthropology, Washington D.C., Georgetown U.P., 1977, with thought-provoking papers by C. A. Ferguson, 'Linguistics as anthropology', pp, 1-12 and G. SankofF, 'Variability and explanation in language and culture', pp. 59 73. A coll. of eleven arts ed. H. Walter, Phonologic et societe (Studia Phonetica, 13), Montreal-Paris, Didier, 1977, shows everywhere the influence of Martinetian functionalism; several papers deal with problems of defining 'standard' languages. To end this section, R. K. S. Macaulay presents a bibliographic ally rich and densely argued explosion of 'The myth of female superiority in language', JCL, 5:353-63; the cold-shower treatment is salutary, for M. identifies several instances of a dubious inference being taken over in a textbook and perpetuated on the flimsiest of evidence. Such is the stuff of prejudice. 9. Language in the Individual Scholarly output in this area has grown exponentially over the past few years (a score of large books and literally hundreds of periodical arts in 1978 alone) ? to the point where it becomes impossible to do justice to the range of activity in a survey of these proportions. It is significant that book-length works are almost never the product of a single author ? eloquent testimony to the dizzy rate of change in the field, its burgeoning diversity and the elusiveness of the balanced and comprehen sive synthesis. In language acquisition, and more particularly language dysfunction, we are clearly at the data-gathering stage with theory trailing far behind. The best available overview is Recent Advances in the Psychology of Language, eds R. N. Campbell</page><page sequence="12">12 General Linguistics and P. T. Smith, N.York, Plenum, the first vol. devoted to language acquisition with emphasis on the less tangible domains of semantics and pragmatics, and the second to experimental work; several authors do not shrink from rather caustic com ment on the cavalier use made by psychologists of linguistic theory. Two other colls should be mentioned here: Processes and Disorders of Human Communication, ed. J. F. Curtis, N.York, Harper and Row, and Studies in the Perception of Language, eds W. J. M. Levelt and G. B. Flores d'Arcais, N.York, Wiley. An invaluable annotated bibl. of Child Language: an inter disciplinary guide to theory and research, is compiled by A. A. Abrahamsen, Baltimore, Univ. Park Press, 1977. Though rather elementary in places, the introd. to Language Acquisition by J. G. and P. A. de Villiers, Harvard U.P., has good coverage and a lucid discussion of Chomsky's ideas on innateness. A determined take-over bid for the whole field is made by L. Bloom and M. Lahey who, in addition to a jointly-authored survey of Language Development and Language Disorders, ed. separate and complementary colls: Readings in Language Develop ment (ed. L. Bloom) and Readings in Childhood Language Dis orders (ed. M. Lahey); 1,621 pp. in toto, all publ. N.York, Wiley. A detailed examination of a correlation noticed long ago by Jakobson is made by A. Caramazza and E. B. Zurif, Language Acquisition and Language Breakdown: Parallels and Divergencies, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins U.P. Observation of 234 children between the ages of two and almost twelve seems to indicate a much longer learning period for some syntactic constructions than is often assumed, according to D. Horgan, 'The develop ment of the full passive', JCL, 5:65-80. Brilliant and, as ever, challenging is W. and T. Labov, 'The phonetics of cat and mama\L, 54:816-52, an exhaustively documented longitudinal study of one child whose linguistic production over almost six months was virtually confined to these two words; from a minute analysis of their phonetism and semantic function the Labovs conclude that 'the apparent plateau of the second year is a site of intensive language-learning', not indeed charac terized by a piling up of new vocabulary but rather by 'learning how to control the linguistic mechanism'. In deliberate reaction to the non-temporal character of most Chomskyan theory, A. H. Wold insists on the importance of</page><page sequence="13">General Linguistics 13 conventions of word order and temporal sequencing as aids for Decoding Oral Language, London, Academic Press. Some corroboration comes from two experimental studies: I. Fischer and R. Goodman, 'Semantics and episodic constraints on the use of surface-order cues in the comprehension of locative sentences', JPR, 7:121-34, and D. J. Townsend and T. G. Bever, 'Interclause relations and clausal processing', JVLVB, 17:509-21, suggesting that the semantic link between main and subordinate clause has to be established before detailed processing of the subordinate can take place. In 'A neural model for language and speech', JPh, 6:283-97, H. W. Bucking ham, Jr, and H. Hollien sketch a servo-mechanism analogue of the nervous system, emphasizing the encoding and continuous feedback processes. 10. Style In The Semantics of Metaphor, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins U.P., 1977, S. R. Levin makes a thoroughgoing investigation of both philosophical and linguistic theories; the section on 'Metaphor as pragmatic deviance' is particularly incisive. S. H. Olsen's hard-hitting assessment of different approaches to The Structure of Literary Understanding, CUP, seeks primarily to discredit those linguistic theories which set off literary from ordinary language and invest it ipso facto with a special elevated status; in their place he would have a two-stage process whereby readers first interpret the author's intentions (on the basis of a shared world-view) and only then evaluate the work's aesthetic qualities. The third title of the 'New Accents' ser. [YWML, 39:12), E. L. Epstein, Language and Style, London, Methuen, is mainly concerned with the superordinate categories of genre and period style. Lang, 51, eds D. Delas and J.-J. Thomas, is devoted to 'Po&amp;ique generative' and incl. a valuable annotated bibl. pp. 105-17. Ideas worked out on English by Halle, Keyser and Kiparsky are applied to French by J. J. Spa, 'Versification et linguistique generative', jV, 62:161-71; despite some adjustment problems, he seems not unhappy with the results.</page></plain_text>
