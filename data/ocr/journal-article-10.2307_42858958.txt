PYE Massachusetts Institute of Technology For was reason a strangely discipline no doubt slow that was to rejoices that incorporate political in importing the science concept had ideas, of long culture. political employed In part science cog- the was strangely slow to incorporate the concept of culture. In part the reason no doubt was that political science had long employed cog- nate concepts which, like culture, promised much for general explanations but proved elusive for pinning down causation in any specific case. For example, first Montesquieu and then the German theorists conceived of law as a web of habits, customs and folk-themes common to a people. The concept of nation provided a further analogy to that of culture. The notion that a constitution reflects the basic values, predispositions and ideals of a community, which came to dominate constitutional theory by the 1930's, was hardly distinguishable from the early and more diffuse definitions of culture common in other social sciences at the time. These classical and neo-classical concepts of political science all con- tained two of the basic ingredients of the modern concept of culture: human communities tend to have distinctive characteristics which last over time, and collectivities have dynamic laws with respect to develop- ment and change. By the early l^O's new concepts based upon new re- search techniques were welcomed into the discipline. The art of sample surveying and with it a new definition of public opinion was demanding academic recognition. At the same time it was becoming increasingly urgent for political science to come to terms with the new revolutionary concept of man which Freuďs discoveries were diffusing to all aspects of Western thought. The time was thus ripe for a new infusion and synthesis of ideas, and World War II made it urgent to get on with the task. The compelling need to train large numbers of people to understand foreign cultures so as to plan for military governments, conduct psychological warfare, and simply to interpret what made the enemy act as he did overnight legitimized area studies and interdisciplinary approaches. The wartime concerns with man and society opened the doors of political science to numerous emerging and powerful concepts from neighboring disciplines. Quite understandably culture was one of these, particularly since for a brief period anthropology appeared as the reigning social science. The notions of area studies and of interdisciplinary research seemed less novel to the anthropologists, who at the time were being led by an extraordi- nary generation of imaginative literary men and women. Even if Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict, Geoffrey Gorer, Clyde Kluckhohn, Abram Kar- diner, George Murdock and others had not been at the forefront of relevant</page><page sequence="2">286 Social Science Quarterly research and effective policy advising during the war, their collective bril- liance and exciting expositions of the relations of culture and personality would have certainly penetrated political science. It is true that these anthropologists, fortified primarily with the concept of culture, greatly overstated their potential contribution to the making of a brave new world of social science in the public service; and to re-read today Clyde Kluck- hohn's assertions in Mirror for Man 1 that once anthropologists "returned home" it would soon be possible to solve the problems of advanced soci- eties and world politics is to capture a sense of nostalgia and also to blush that such hubris was once routinely accepted. Inflated claims aside, Clyde Kluckhohn did lead in the establishment of the model postwar area study program at the Harvard Russian Research Center. In retrospect it seems strange that in a postwar environment in which the concept of culture was so pervasive in the social sciences it still took nearly a decade for the concept of political culture to be formulated. Gabriel A. Almonďs initiation of the term and the concept came in his classic article in 1956, 2 and two years later Samuel H. Beer and Adam B. Ulam made the concept of political culture central in their jointly edited comparative politics text.3 While these were the first explicit uses of the term political culture, other writers during the decade after World War II were contributing to a substantially rising interest in the implicit use of the concept of culture in political analysis. Studies of national character were increasingly based on more sophisticated views about socialization and cultural transmission. In the strictly political field, Nathan Leites made a completely original innovation in elite analysis with his concept that leadership elements tend to share a common "operational code."4 In his monumental Study of Bolshevism 5 Leites demonstrated that the insights of depth psychology could be applied to study the collective "style" and "spirit" of a political class that shared important common experiences.6 In positing a basically characterological concept of the dynamic bases of political behavior Leites operated with the basic anthropological concept that personality and culture are the opposite sides of the same coin. He thus succeeded in advancing the application of psychological, and par- ticularly psychoanalytical, insights from the study of individual political figures (as for example in the Georges' analysis of Woodrow Wilson7) to the study of groups of men, that is a sub-culture. 1 Clyde Kluckhohn, Mirror for Man (New York: Whittlesey House, 1949). 2 Gabriel A.

The behavioral revolution, which was bringing to the discipline a flood of concepts from psychology and its related fields, made it inevitable that political scientists would soon be employing the concept of "political culture" where they had once used such concepts as public opinion, political ideology, national ethos and the basic consensus, values and constitutional integrating sentiments of a people. Gabriel A. Almond in recently summarizing the intellectual history of the political culture concept noted that his views were influenced by three particular intellectual currents that seemed to him to converge to produce the concept.8 First, there was the tradition of sociological theory developed by Max Weber and Talcott Parsons which stressed the under- lying subjective norms and idealized patterns in providing cohesion and structure to social systems. The second current was that of the psycho- analytically oriented anthropologists, which we have just stressed. The third current sprang from the theories, assumptions and even techniques basic to the development of sample surveys. The concept of culture seemed to be the one that best brought together all these strands and suggested moreover that there might be a unifying basis for both society and polity. THE SHORT STEP FROM ACCEPTANCE TO VULGARIZATION Although the term political culture is fast becoming a common term among political sicentists and, indeed, intellectuals in general, it remains an elusive concept. Like so many concepts in the social sciences which initially represented powerful and vivid insights but which soon become vague and empty through indiscriminate use, there is a danger that the notion of political culture will become, as Sidney Verba has warned, a residual category casually used to explain anything that cannot be ex- plained by more precise and concrete factors.9 Because of this almost law- like tendency towards fuzziness of all usable concepts in the social sci- ences - note what has happened to such concepts as "identity" and "alien- ation" as they have become commonplace - it is essential from time to time to re-examine concepts and see if and how they can continue to con- tribute to theoretical advances in the social sciences. As used by most political scientists the concept of political culture comes from Gabriel A. Almond's observation that "every political system is em- bedded in a particular pattern of orientation to political actions."10 This definition leaves open as to whether the political culture is functional to 8 Communication to the Conference on Political Culture and Communist Studies, Arden House, November 19-21, 1971.

Sidney Verba's definition that "The political culture of a society consists of the system of empirical beliefs, expressive symbols, and values which defines the situation in which political action takes place"11 is also open to several interpretations. So is the statement with which I began the article on the subject in the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences : Political culture is the set of attitudes, beliefs, and sentiments which give order and meaning to a political process and which provide the underlying assumptions and rules that govern behavior in the political system. It en- compasses both the political ideals and the operating norms of a polity. Political culture is thus the manifestation in aggregate form of the psycho- logical and subjective dimension of politics.12 All of these definitions stress the psychological or subjective aspect of behavior. In doing so they also, however, imply that the political realm is to some degree distinct and separate from the general culture. In contrast early national character studies tended to treat all behavior as essentially interrelated so that analysis might leap from toilet training to high level policy making and back again with little sense that the political life of a society might have its own rules and the capacity to filter out some atti- tudes while accentuating others. What the concept of political culture has achieved in the first instance has been to make more vivid the distinction between political attitudes and values on the one hand and general cultural values on the other. This in itself represents a substantial advance in conceptualization. What has generally remained unclear, however, is whether the concept of political culture involves only the psychological aspects of political life. Should the concept apply only to subjective considerations or does it also involve actual behavior patterns? If the term is meant to include both psychological and behavioral patterns then it would seem to come perilously close to being no more than a pretentious way of referring to political behavior. If the value of the concept of political culture is to be maintained, and its potential fully realized, then it is important to examine its advantages and to explore the limits of what it refers to. Our purpose in these pages will therefore be to try to identify the difficulties in conceptual precision and to suggest possible solutions. WHERE TO BEGIN? THE INDIVIDUAL OR THE POLITY? The concept of culture when applied to political analysis has proved to be both exciting and confusing because it appears to confront an increas- 11 Verba, "Comparative Political Culture," p. 513. 12 International Encyclopedia of tne boctal sciences (JNew xorK: Macmillan uo. ana The Free Press, 1961 ) , Vol. 12, p. 218.</page><page sequence="5">CULTURE AND POLITICAL SCIENCE 289 ingly perplexing problem in political science - that of the gap between micro-analysis and macro-analysis - but all too often it seems to provide only a fudging answer. The basic problem of behavioral political science is that of trying to go from an understanding of individual psychology to the performance of collective entities. How is it possible to incorporate into a discipline that is ultimately concerned with macro-systems the rich insights of modern psychology and the discoveries about individual behavior? In more traditional political theory this problem did not exist because generalizations about collectivities were readily accepted and action was seen in terms of the dynamics of such entities as organizations, parties, nations and other institutions. The general principle of political theory was that institutions were assumed to have inherent properties separate from the properties of any particular individual. Above all the concept of legitimacy meant that offices and organs of government were seen as being governed by more than just the individual who might occupy them at any time. The behavioral revolution reversed this tendency by emphasizing that the act should be the unit of analysis, that only individuals can act, and that the actions of institutions thus always depend upon decisions which can only occur in the minds of particular individuals. This emphasis upon the central role of action by individuals provided an easy opening to bring into political science the advances of psychology and particularly the con- sequences of the Freudian revolution. Since all action of any political sig- nificance ultimately springs from the actions of particular individuals, the way seemed to be opened for political scientists to benefit from all the advances in psychology. The opportunities soon proved to create new problems for the discipline because the linkages between individual action and collective action re- main obscure and have not been centrally dealt with by psychology. Heinz Eulau has identified several fallacies that have crept into political science as it has grappled with the micro/macro problem: . . . there is the fallacy of extrapolation from micro to macro phenomena. Small units are treated as analogues of large ones, and the finds on the micro level are extended to the macro level. There is a fallacy of personifi- cation: large-scale phenomena are reduced to the individual level through the use of anthropomorphic categories of analysis, as in the more grotesque descriptions of "national character." Or there is the fallacy of misplaced concreteness : interactional and relational phenomena are reified and treated as if they were physical entities.13 Freud himself contributed to the fallacy of extrapolating from the in- dividual to society when in Totem and Taboo and Civilization and its Dis- contents he suggested that the historical development of human societies followed the laws of personality development. This is the tradition that the 13 Heinz Eulau, "Political Behavior," Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences ( New York: Free Press-Macmillan Co., 1968).</page><page sequence="6">290 Social Science Quarterly cultural anthropologists have also tended to stress with their view that the collective culture and individual personalities mirror each other. It is of great significance that Harold Lasswell, in first bringing psycho- logical insights to political science, proceeded in the opposite manner and in the classic tradition of political science accepted the collective system as given, composed, however, of roles which could reflect the personalities of their occupants.14 For Lasswell the political system has a functional in- tegrity of its own and thus the roles that make it up have to be performed, up to a point, according to criteria inherent in the system. The psycho- logical dimension of behavior thus becomes a way of enriching and finding greater subtlety in explaining the performance of roles by particular in- dividuals. Thus in the application of psychology to political analysis there have been these two basic approaches, the one which begins with the system and macro-analysis and then introduces a human and biographical- psychological dimension, and the other which begins with the formation of personality and micro-analysis and sees the larger system as essentially the manifestations of the human personality as shaped by the socialization process. Aside from national character studies the second approach has been employed in such studies as that of the relationship between person- ality and political opinion and prejudice15 and in the extremely creative studies by Nathan Leites of the operational codes of various elites which suggest a characterological basis to political strategies.16 Against that background of intellectual history, the concept of political culture sought to reduce the gap between macro- and micro-analysis by suggesting that the linkages lie in the complex processes of political sociali- zation by which political systems maintain their continuity and individuals learn how to perform appropriate political roles. Political socialization in- cludes both early personality development and later cognitive learning about politics, particularly as this later involves the process of recruitment to political roles. To the extent that the emphasis is placed upon the early stages of socialization the political culture approach leans in the direction of the earlier work in psycho-cultural analysis; when the emphasis shifts more to cognitions and explicitly learned patterns of behavior the stress is more on the basic features of the political system and on the need for the individual to accommodate to the imperatives of the political process. In practice, the ease with which it becomes possible, with the political culture approach, to shift the focus back and forth between personality and po- litical system means that the micro/macro problem becomes blurred, either by still fudging the issue, or, quite legitimately, by a systematic progres- 14 Harold D.

MISPLACED PRECISION: WHEN THE PARTS ARE MORE THAN THE WHOLE The hope that the concept of political culture, reinforced by the con- cepts of political socialization and recruitment, might effectively bridge the gap between micro- and macro-analysis encouraged a search for greater precision in measuring all forms of political attitudes and senti- ments. A source of dissatisfaction among political scientists with the ad- mittedly very insightful psychoanalytically oriented "national character" studies has been not only their tendency to move glibly between childhood and sophisticated political behavior but also the lack of scientific precision in the generalizations. In theory, generalizations about national tempera- ment should be no different from other generalizations about macro- systems. Twenty years ago, writing in the first issue of World Politics, Nathan Leites stated the essentially logical-positivist view that "hypotheses about cultural patterns should be treated by conventional canons of social science, the terms need only to be specified and made operational and vague references to matters of degree and frequency should be made more quantitatively precise."17 The difficulty, however, is that there is an under- standable suspicion of subjective bias when people describe the traits of foreigners. In order to meet this problem and quite legitimate concerns about the possibility of validating statements of national opinion and sentiment, political scientists have turned to the most sophisticated tech- niques they have for measuring opinion, sample surveys. National differ- ences based on systematic surveys would seem to be more valid than generalizations based upon such apparently less quantitative approáches as, say, the methods of the participant observer and those of the anthro- pologists. The use of attitudinal and opinion surveys to gain precision has created some new problems in the conceptualization of political cultures. Specifi- cally it has suggested that political cultures are in fact defined by the dis- tribution of attitudes, opinions and sentiments among the given population. The prevalence of views and the differences of their percentage distribu- tions are thus taken to provide the basis for characterizing differences among political cultures. The ability to speak with scientific assurance about differences among populations, however, obscures the fact that this approach is merely a more sophisticated version of the fallacy that macro- systems are no more than extrapolations of micro-systems. In addition two further problems have been raised by this approach: the relationship between "attitudes" and "behaviors," and the compound- 17 Nathan Leites, "Psycho-Cultural Hypotheses about Political Acts," World Politics , 1 (Oct., 1948), pp. 102-119.</page><page sequence="8">292 Social Science Quarterly ing difficulty that the individual (or sub-system) is more complex and reflects more subtle sentiments and attitudes than does the political system as a whole. The first problem is that people seem to have more opinions than po- litically significant actions. Through the techniques of modern psychology we can uncover a rich subjective world, but it becomes extremely difficult to determine what aspects of the individual's inner world will govern his objective behavior. The second problem is that, since the subjective realm of the individual is more complex than the objective reality of prosaic political systems, it becomes impossible to determine by beginning with the individual which of his attitudes are the most relevant for understanding why a political system performs as it does. Therefore, the aggregating or totaling up of the attitudes of individuals produces a "sum" that far exceeds the "sum" of at- titudes essential for explaining the performance of the particular system. It is this bountifulness of subjective political attitudes which makes it so difficult to construct even the key features of a political system out of the "orientations" of its members. AN ANALOGY FBOM ECONOMICS This macro/micro problem in political culture analysis can be illustrated by trying to imagine what might have happened if a behaviorally oriented revolution had hit economics before Keynes made his great breakthrough in depicting the basic model of national income flows. Under such con- ditions it is conceivable that researchers would have engaged in attitude studies and even depth interviews of entrepreneurs, investors, customers and business men in the hopes of discovering how all of their motivations, expectations and values related to each other and produced a functioning economic system. One thing we could be confident of is that no matter how skillful or precise they were in their measuring of attitudes, they never would have been able to total up the subjective worlds and arrive at the Keynesian model for macro-economic theory. What has happened, of course, is that once basic macro-theory was ac- cepted in economics, an appropriate context was established for micro- analysis. The fact that businessmen and customers have a wide range of emotions and motivations which influence their behavior can be intro- duced to modify and enrich the basic theory, but such facts do not in any way confuse the objectives of macro-analysis. It is true that the economists have reduced their problems greatly by simply keeping macro- and micro- theory completely separate and not attempting to arrive at a general theory; but to tne extent that they have been interested in enriching economics with behavioral and psychological considerations it has been within the context of accepting the primacy of the macro-model as the proper starting point.</page><page sequence="9">CULTURE AND POLITICAL SCIENCE 293 THE "AS IF" HYPOTHESIS; AND A FORM OF PREDICTION What we have been arguing is that political culture must be studied on the basis of an understanding of how the particular political system per- forms. The initial hypotheses about a political culture must thus take the form of statements which hold that the system behaves "as if" certain values, sentiments, and orientations were the most critical in giving the collectivity its distinctive character. The political culture thus consists of those "orientations" that make the system distinctive, not necessarily the ones that may be most distinctive among all the attitudes a population may hold. In introducing a study of the Chinese political culture I noted that my concern was to describe the constellation of sentiment and attitudes that we feel must have existed for the Chinese political system to have developed as it has. We are not concerned with questions about the actual distribution of atti- tudes and feelings throughout the Chinese population. Even if we could obtain accurate sample survey results on the political attitudes of all Chinese, it would not serve our purposes greatly; and for the same reason that accurate attitudinal studies of investors and consumers, for example, would not have been relevant in developing the Keynesian model of na- tional income accounting.18 It should be noted that these initial system-oriented hypotheses may be of the character that seek to explain either particular systems or certain more general categories of systems. The classic example of the latter type of political culture study is Almond and Verbas Civic Culture 19 in which their prime theoretic concern was the explanation of democratic stability for which they posited the necessity of a generalized "civic culture," and then tested samples in five different countries to determine the relative prevalence of that "culture." It is thus the culture which imparts meaning and even gives substantial structure to the political system. Observations about the performance of a system thus suggest what attitudes are probably important in making the system operate as it does. At this point the analysis must shift to the indi- vidual for two reasons. First for the obvious need to test whether the sub- jective factors posited as being critical for system performance do in fact exist at all among the relevant population. Secondly, it is necessary to test system-oriented hypotheses in terms of individual psychology because of the potency of psychological theories in suggesting relationships and pat- terns of basic orientations. We shall in a moment return to this problem of how coherence in personality may provide guides to coherence among larger cultural themes, but first we must comment further about the use of 18 Lucian W. Pye, The Spirit of Chinese Politics: A Psychocultural Study of the Au- thority Crisis in Political Development (Cambridge: M.I.T. Press, 1968), p. viii. 19 Gabriel A. Almond and Sidney Verba, The Civic Culture (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1963; paperback ed., Boston: Little Brown &amp; Co., 1965).</page><page sequence="10">294 Social Science Quarterly individual psychological findings to "tesť general hypotheses about a political culture. It is far from clear what canons of science are called for to "tesť hypothe- ses about the political culture that underlies a political system. There is first of all a question of the significance of quantitative degrees in testing such hypotheses. To what extent does a population have to demonstrate the presence of certain values and attitudes in order for us to be confident that our initial hypothesis was correct in posing the necessity of such val- ues for the system to operate as it does? For example, in the case of democ- racy, to what extent do people have to have the various qualities associated with the "civic culture" for there to be a stable democracy? Our problem here, as with so much of political science theory building, is that we are able to fairly effectively identify "necessary" conditions, but we are very weak with respect to identifying "sufficient" conditions. We can say with greater confidence what is necessary for something to happen than whether what in fact exists is sufficient to produce the expected outcome. A second problem of "testing" in individual attitudes hypotheses about collective behaviors is that of determining what are the appropriate "indi- cators" or empirical referents for essentially subjective factors. For exam- ple, if we hypothesize that "nationalism" has been a decisive force shaping the political culture of twentieth century China - a statement historians, accustomed as they are to broad generalizations, would have no doubts about - we might still have found it hard to identify this sentiment in its inchoate form in sample surveys if we had been able to administer them in the first decades of this century. What are the deeply held feelings of an unpolicitized population which can give expression to nationalism once that population became politically conscious? The problem is more than just one of interpreting the content of values, for often the test of a political culture is the combinations of values, re- gardless of content, that is critical. The strength of democracy in India, for example, may rest less upon how widespread are liberal democratic values among the Indian masses than upon the tolerance of Indians for the differences they have in their basic values. In summary, these and other problems of "testing" political culture hypotheses all involve the arrival at types of approximations which can make possible the particular form of "prediction" that is the ultimate test of political culture statements. These are "predictions" which are not fore- casts or even statements of probabilities of future events, but are rather statements as to what would be consistent with the assumed underlying characeristics of the political culture. This form of "predicting" which is more a judgment of plausibility than a strict statement of customary contingency prediction is what Clifford Geertz had in mind when he said that there was a relationship between the important place that cockfighting occupies in Balinese culture and the violent intra-village slaughtering of Balinese of each other after the un- successful Communist coup of 1965.</page><page sequence="11">CULTURE AND POLITICAL SCIENCE 295 This is not to say, of course, that the killings were caused by the cock- fight, could have been predicted on the basis of it, or were some sort of enlarged version of it with real people in the place of the cocks - all of which is nonsense. It is merely to say that if one looks at Bali not just through the medium of its dances, it shadowplays, its sculputure, and its girls, but - as the Balinese themselves do - also through the medium of its cockfight, the fact that the massacre occurred seems, if no less appalling, less like a contradiction to the laws of nature.20 CAN PLAUSIBILITY BECOME A RIGOROUS CONCEPT? We now confront a cruel paradox: political scientists are able to be increasingly rigorous and precise with respect to measurement at the micro-analysis level, but our theories are not sensitive to the importance of quantitative differences in attitudes and sentiments, only to the neces- sity of "appropriate" attitudes existing among the critical elements; on the other hand, it is at the macro level that the critical hypotheses must be ad- vanced and "tested," but it is at this level we lack capacity for rigor and precision. In part this is because in political science we do not have a tra- dition for systematically evaluating plausibility statements. In journalism and government service there is greater awareness of skill in applying knowledge and judgment to understanding why events occur as they do. There is a need at this stage in the evolution of the concept of political culture to try to design better ways of judging whether hypotheses about particular political cultures have provided the kind of highly qualified pre- dictive powers necessary to suggest their validity. The danger, of course, is that any analyst, if left to himself, can always see his own work as pro- viding a completely plausible understanding for whatever may have happened in the country of his analysis. Possibly the problem might become more manageable if there was a tendency for studies of political culture to focus on common themes. For- tunately there are several candidates that have attracted widespread in- terest, and they include the themes of attitudes towards power and authority, the character of hierarchical relations, the acceptance of free- dom, and patterns and expectations of participation. If studies of political culture were to converge more with respect to key themes then it would be easier to judge the extent to which particular studies have successfully added to our capacity to understand particular systems. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The concept of political culture has been an exciting addition to political science which has enriched comparative analysis. Above all the concept has provided a promising way of incorporating psychological insights into the study of political systems. In so seeking to bridge the gap between macro- and micro-analysis, political science has sought to move ahead of economics. 20 Clifford Geertz, Balinese Cockfight, "Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight/ Daedalus ; Myth, Symbol, and Culture , 101 (Winter, 1972), p. 37.</page><page sequence="12">296 Social Science Quarterly At the same time the concept of political culture leaves many problems unresolved and it highlights the inherent difficulties in achieving sys- tematic analysis with respect to macro-systems in political science. The concept of political culture has made it clear that it is impossible to extra- polate from the richness of individual psychology to the less coherently structured patterns of collective behavior common to political systems. The basic problem is that while the sub-systems ( that is, the individuals ) condition and limit, and thus in a sense "determine" the behavior of the macro-system, it is impossible to infer the character of the larger system from a detailed examination of its component "sub-systems." The situation is analogous to our ability to say "something" about what a building will be like from knowledge about what its building elements are like, but to truly "picture" the building we need also to know the blue-prints and the total design. Progress in the use of the political culture concept thus calls for more ef- fective ways of describing total systems and for identifying what are likely to be the most critical factors in improving our ability to understand and in a limited sense "predict" system performance. Until we can arrive at better standards for evaluating system performance, and hence determining the "accuracy" of "predictions," the concept of political culture will still be of great value in making analysts more sensitive to the significance of underlying psychological factors in political life. The concept of political culture does imply that there is an underlying and latent coherence in political life. Among political scientists there has been a long standing acceptance of the idea of such a basic and implicit force in human societies, as demonstrated in general acceptance of such concepts as collective will, social contract, constitutional consensus, and inherent values. At the same time political scientists tend to treat such underlying forces as being somewhat vague and only a determining factor at the extremes of behavior - it is accepted that within the limits of the constitutional consensus, that is of the political culture, there can be a fair variety of behavior that is still "consistent," and hence culturally accept- able. In this sense the concept of "culture" in political science suggests less rigorously defined and precise patterns of behavior than does the concept of culture in anthropology. In fact this may be exaggerated because politi- cal scientists tend to work on more diffusely structured and less culturally homogeneous societies. In sum we can say that in spite of the difficulties in rigorously applying the concept, political culture will continue to attract attention among political scientists. Indeed awareness of the difficulties may serve to pro- duce sensitive but also balanced and judicious uses of psychological in- sights in political science. Concern with these problems may reduce the ever present temptation to use "psychologizing" as a veiled technique for prejudicial studies of political actors. The concept of culture is much too valuable to be allowed to be discredited by being used for base purposes.</page></plain_text>
