<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TRUE TRAGEDY ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GREEK TRAGEDY AND PLATO BY HELMUT KUHN I* "Plato was still a poet of the race of Homer and Pindar and Aeschylus, though the first of philosophers." PAUL ELMER MORE i-Introduction O NLY a brief interval separates Plato's work from the flowering of Attic tragedy. When Sophocles died, Plato had just come of age. So the question naturally arises whether the chronological succession is historically significant. Can we discover a line of de- velopment leading from Aeschylus and Sophocles to Plato? Is tragedy among the logical antecedents of Platonic philosophy? In the following pages the attempt at an affirmative answerwill be made. The question of a relationship between tragedy and Plato's philosophy is meaningful only if we think of the two creations as subserving a common cause, the philosopher making a fresh start where the tragedians had left off. The enterprise in which they were successively engaged will be viewed (a) as the working out of an antithetical vision of reality, (b) as a solution to the problem of suffering and evil, and (c) as a deepening of the human self-con- sciousness. (a) It is in the nature of reality to lend itself to an interpretation in polar terms. But the Greek mind refused to rush to that easy solution which represents the world as a contest between good and evil-a simplification which is likely to stifle the impulse toward knowledge. The Greek approach to the problem seems calculated to keep it at first in the back-ground so that, when the duality was finally to emerge as a dominant feature, it might unify and articu- late a mature vision of reality rather than cripple a nascent picture of the world. Instead of crystallizing at once into definite religious * NoTE-The second part of this article is expected to appear in a later volume of H.S.C.P.</page><page sequence="2">2 Helmut Kuhn or moral terms, the idea of a basic antagonism permeated experi- ence gradually like a leaven. In this formative process tragedy and Platonic philosophy mark successive stages, and it is difficult to conceive the second without the first. The tragic antithesis of protagonist and antagonist reappears transfigured in Plato's dia- logues as the struggle of Socrates against the Sophists, or as the duality of Divine Reason and Necessity. This transfiguration is a progress towards greater clarity. However, the successful clarifica- tion of problems that baffled the tragic poets brings up new prob- lems insoluble to Plato, which revealed their full import only to the thinkers of the Christian era, especially to St. Augustine. (b) An element of perplexity is inherent in all human suffering. The man in distress is prone to ask: Why did this misery overtake me? Whose is the fault? What is its meaning? Thus a community of interests exists between the tragedian who represents suffering and the philosopher who is concerned with man's intellectual per- plexity; and it is not surprising that Plato's criticism of poetry largely hinges upon the problem of suffering and of the treatment given it by the poets. They dabble, Plato thinks, in the philoso- pher's business, and he sets out to supplant their faulty tragedy with a poetry of his own, the "truest tragedy." Plato's hostility to the tragedians is that of a competitor and successor. His rival creation, designed to deal adequately with misery and happiness, has, in large measure, a political and pedagogical meaning. It ad- dresses itself to those who either are unfit for philosophy by nature or have not yet attained to maturity. But it is also stimulated by the disquieting presence of those unsolved problems which arise with Plato's rationalization of the Aeschylean theodicy. (c) The clarification of the antithetical conception of life throws into prominence the decisive r61le played by the human agent. "It is not I that am the cause, but Zeus and Destiny and Erinys that walks in darkness who put blind fury into my heart." In these words, Agamemnon in the Iliad (XIX 86-88, tr. Cornford) excuses a demeanor that all but ruined the Greek cause. The tragic hero no longer acquiesces in this subterfuge, though he still has recourse to it; and in Plato it is definitely banned. The increasing sense of responsibility corresponds to the deepening of man's perplexity</page><page sequence="3">The True Tragedy: Greek Tragedy and Plato, I 3 when confronted with the choice. Orestes' question "What shall I do?" and Socrates' problem "What is the good?" mark consecutive stages in the growth of the self-consciousness of the human agent. This process is bound up with a gradual emancipation of the indi- vidual from ancient limitations and allegiances. The idea of man as a dependent part of a sacred world-order has found its classical expression in the Greek belief in the cosmos. The growth, there- fore, of the consciousness of freedom goes hand in hand with a dis- integration of this creed. Regarding this strain of thought, Plato's philosophy will again be seen to push to its logical conclusions a tendency adumbrated in tragedy. The three trends just distinguished are aspects of a unified de- velopment. Only after the first steps were taken toward rationaliz- ing the idea of a universal antagonism did it become possible to raise the problem of suffering in unequivocal terms; and the same clarification brought man face to face with himself as the author of his deeds. The universal significance of this development is two- fold, and both aspects will receive attention in the sequel. As a unique process of growth, it supplied one of the corner-stones of our civilization and forms a chapter in the history of human freedom. Awakening from his mythic slumber, man begins to realize what it means to be a human agent. On the other hand, we may look upon the same facts as illustrating a timeless antagonism, and view tragedy and philosophy as alternative ways of dealing with the problem of suffering. The first brings about a catharsis by the poetic utterance of passion, the other assuages passion in contem- plation. A profound concord underlies the antagonism of these cures. The pleasurable discharge will not be achieved unless the poet rises to a unified vision of reality, logically deficient though it be. Likewise the contemplative life will become a dishonest escape, unless it grows out of an undaunted recognition of the antinomies of reality. The air of tragedy hovers over Eros, the guiding demon of the philosopher and his likeness, as the Symposium depicts him. "Hard is he and parched, shoeless and homeless; on the bare ground always he lies without bedding; and takes his rest on doorsteps and waysides in the open air; true to his mother's nature, he always dwells with want" (2o3cd, tr. Lamb).</page><page sequence="4">4 Helmut Kuhn ii-Drama and Dialectic Plato's literary work abounds with evidence of the multitudi- nous influences under which his thought took shape, and modern research has been successful in evaluating his explicit or tacit ref- erences to predecessors and in apportioning its share to each school of thought. As a result, Orphism alongside its close ally Pythago- reanism, Ionian cosmology from Thales down to Anaxagoras, Hera- clitus, the Eleatic school, and the Sophists stand out as the chief sources on which Plato drew; not to mention Socrates, whose unique figure is hardly to be disengaged from the work of his great disciple. This list covers the decisive intellectual achievements of the pre-Platonic era with one exception. Greek poetry is rarely granted a major position among Plato's spiritual ancestors. This is not to say that the modern historians of philosophy have failed to utilize Homer, the lyric poets, and Attic tragedy as documents of the mental evolution leading up to Plato's philosophical syn- thesis. But as a rule the poets in this connection were studied as a medium rather than for what they might have to say on their own account. Pindar, for example, and Sophocles are cited as witnesses of the Orphic creed and thus linked, in an indirect way, with the Platonic world. Since, however, the Orphic idea of a posthumous bliss is a distinctive feature neither of Pindar's odes nor of Sopho- clean tragedy, the observation is irrelevant to our present query, which concerns the direct relationship between tragic poetry and Plato. The same holds good of numerous sayings both in lyric poetry and in tragedy which reflect a current popular wisdom. Again the fact that some such dicta are echoed in Plato or Aristotle gives little support to the thesis of an immediate and significant influence. We may or we may not believe that Plato, when elabo- rating the myth of the origin of civilization which he put into Pro- tagoras' mouth, remembered the second song of the chorus in the Antigone. The isolated borrowing, even if it were irrefutably estab- lished, would in itself be of little consequence. In the following pages the problem of the relationship between Platonic philosophy and tragedy as an entity (and not as a medium) will be discussed. With Euripides, Greek tragedy became 'litera- ture' in a new sense of the word. His inquisitive and restless mind</page><page sequence="5">The True Tragedy: Greek Tragedy and Plato, I 5 was casting about for fresh solutions to the problems of his day, and he freely experimented with views propounded by contempo- rary scientists and philosophers. This novel kind of overt inter- course between poetry and philosophy as two types of literature raises special problems which, for our present purpose, may be disregarded. I shall concern myself almost exclusively with Aeschy- lus and Sophocles. The problem is whether they rank as peers with Plato's acknowledged precursors. The possible objection that poetry should not be taken too seriously as a vehicle of thought, is quickly to be dismissed. The Greeks, at any rate, did take poetry seriously. When Plato enumerates earlier cosmological hypotheses, he adduces Homer along with the Ionian physiologists; and when, in another context, he discredits poetry as fancy, his verdict hits also the pioneers of Greek speculation. Once this is conceded, a sense of historical proportion, aside from any specific arguments, may lead us to seek tragedy among the tributaries of Plato's thought. Plato, a lordly borrower, may well be expected to have laid under contribution a unique creation, like the new philosophy a native of the Attic soil, which "restored to Greek poetry its power of embracing all human interests."' A brief examination of the literary form provides another pre- liminary argument. Aristotle, in a well-known passage of his Poetics,2 groups the Socratic Conversations (a species comprising not only Plato's writings but also those of Alexamenus, Aeschines, and the rest) with Sophron's and Xenarchus' Mimes. Both types of literature combine prose with dramatic form. The idea of a relationship between the Platonic dialogues and the Mime is fur- ther confirmed by Plato's recorded admiration for Sophron's plays, and also by covert allusions to the Sicilian playwright in the dia- logues.3 As Sicilian influence is traceable in Aeschylus, an indirect connection between the tragedian and Plato may be assumed.* But 'Werner Jaeger, Paideia, The Ideals of Greek Culture, tr.

In Aristotle's language, the Socratic Conversations are "of grave importance" (crrovua^ot), and the Mimes are not. Stressing this distinction be- tween the serious and the ludicrous instead of that between prose and verse, we come to modify Aristotle's observation and to place the Socratic Conversations beside tragedy. Within the framework of the Aristotelian concepts the two pair off as dramatic imitations (in contradistinction to narration) of a serious character. A nucleus of historical significance will be discovered in this classification. In Plato's dialogues the clash of diametrically opposed views takes on dramatic life owing to an assignment of these views to suitable char- acters-a literary device known under the name of 'syncrisis.' The antagonism of philosophy and sophistry, that is, of two conceptions of life, is represented as a conflict between persons, between Soc- rates and the Sophists. Plato must have found examples of a dramatized dialectic in Epicharmus, "the pinnacle of comedy,"' and we may picture to ourselves the fierce arguments that Earth had with Sea, or Logos with Logina, as burlesque anticipations of the Socratic logomachia.6 But with even greater confidence we may assert that a pre-Socratic form of the controversial dialogue is found in tragedy. In the verbal duels between Antigone and Ismene, Antigone and Creon, Neoptolemus and Odysseus, Electra and Chrysothemis, the unity of viewpoint and character, or of logical contradiction and actual conflict, is the nerve of a dramatic process which culminates in the swift alternation of thrust and counter-thrust of the sticho- mythy: Electra: Do not teach me to be unfaithful to those I love. Chrysothemis: Not this I teach, but to yield to those in power. (El. 395-6.) The conflict between the philosopher and the sophist that animates the Platonic dialogues is, according to Aristotle, based on a diver- gence of the "choice of life" (7ro0 flov r^i rpoaLpr~EL).J The one chooses a life worth living, because based on the truth about human life, the other the semblance of such a life. The tragic couples listed 6 Theaetetus, 152e. 6 Cf. Gilbert Norwood, Greek Comedy, London, 1931, pp. l05-1o6. 7 Metaphys. II ioo4b 25-26.</page><page sequence="7">The True Tragedy: Greek Tragedy and Plato, I 7 above likewise impersonate contrasting 'lives.' The outer appear- ance of the two sisters in Sophocles' Electra is calculated to make this clear. Electra is discovered pale, with haggard looks, outworn, in rags, Chrysothemis fresh and youthful, in princely garments. Again there is no doubt that these conflicting patterns of life do not simply express divergent characters, but result from a decision. "Make at last your choice!" Electra impatiently demands,8 and she contends that the issue is between the right, loyally defended at whatever price, and the comforts of life bought by cowardice.9 In the sequel we shall meet the notion of the tragic choice again. In the variegated host of Sophists portrayed by Plato we discern a peculiar type most brilliantly represented by Protagoras. In him and his like, prudence and adaptability come to resemble temper- ance; and opportunism, disguised as wisdom, assumes an air of dignity. His notion that for the citizens good is whatever the state, and that means its rulers, consider good, goes well with Ismene's or Chrysothemis' maxim: Yield to the mighty! Chrysothemis' hope to find forbearance (-vypCry' )10o from him whose memory she betrays may be viewed as the feminine counter-part to the Sophist's humble and self-complacent claim to contribute his bit to the prop- agation of the very knowledge the foundations of which he denies. A kindred constellation characterizes both the tragic and the Platonic-dialectical antagonism. Uncompromising firmness joins issue with the artful versatility of the children of this world. The similarity of the basic configuration occasionally results in identical forms of speech. In Sophocles' Philoctetes Odysseus, master in the art of "deceiving the soul by words,"" proclaims as the upshot of his wisdom that "the tongue, and not deeds, rules the world."12 Infuriated by Neoptolemus' refusal to conform to his plans, he exclaims: "By the gods, do you say this to insult me?" "Not unless it is insult to tell the truth," Neoptolemus retorts.'3 In the opening paragraph of the Apology Socrates warns his judges not to confuse his own way of speaking with the sophistic rhetoric of a lawyer. My hearers will find that I am no orator, he says, "unless they con- sider a powerful orator him who tells the truth."

In Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound the conflict is between the "an- thropophile" Titan, the savior of mankind, and Zeus, the new ruler of the universe, tyrannical, irritable, and vindictive. Their struggle dramatizes to some extent the antagonism of right and might. Three persons (or groups of persons) successively approach the suf- ferer, each in his own way reflecting the power of Zeus and trying to mediate between the antagonists. First the Oceanids appear, mildly upbraiding Prometheus for his over-bold language. Oceanus follows, in word and deed a devotee of the maxim "not to kick against the pricks";15 finally Hermes arrives, a docile instrument of the supreme power, the prototype of the stage-courtier. But re- proach, argument, and threat merely serve to stir the Titan's de- fiance into open rebellion. This outline of the tragic plot may be compared with the composition of Plato's Gorgias, a dialogue which, roughly speaking, also hinges upon the problem of might and right. Again we find three emissaries of the principle of the 'tyrannical life' taking issue with the advocate of justice, and their succession too forms a climax. The principle is merely implied in Polos' notion of a morally neutral rhetoric (but the orator's power is significantly compared with that of a tyrant);1" it is professed by Gorgias with restrictions imposed by a conventional bashfulness; and it comes out into the open with the unscrupulous Callicles: might is right. Socrates is not nailed to a solitary cliff. But even in the urbane Platonic disputation, with its intellectually rarified atmosphere, tragedy looms up. Callicles' words broadly hint at the fate which awaits Socrates." Moreover, Plato himself encourages us to link the world of his dialogue with that of tragedy. The alternative at issue is illustrated by a reference to Zethus and Amphion, the dis- similar brothers brought on the stage by Euripides in his Antiope: the one bold, strong, and rough, the other a gentle friend of the 14 Louis Dyer in "Plato as Playwright," Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, XII (1901), 171, calls attention to an analogy between the prologue in tragedy and that in Plato's dialogues. 16 P.V. 323- 16 466b. 17 486ab.</page><page sequence="9">The True Tragedy: Greek Tragedy and Plato, I 9 muses, the first representing the active, the second the contempla- tive life.'8 Both tragedy and Platonic dialogue are largely concerned with dialectically opposed patterns of life. However, the antithesis of the active and the theoretical life must not be taken at its face-value. To grasp its meaning, a com- parison with the playful dialectic of the Hippias Minor will be helpful. Knowledge, Plato here intimates, is inseparable from ex- cellence in general. Hence Odysseus, superior to Achilles in clever- ness, must be recognized as the better man of the two. But Sopho- cles had placed the man of the deed above the man of the tongue, and so it seems as if Plato had reversed the tragedians' scale of values. Actually, he confirms it in a curiously modified form. For 'tongue' he substitutes 'word' (X&amp;yos), for cleverness wisdom. A double-barrelled argument is presented in the Hippias Minor, or rather the explicit reasoning is ironically contradicted by the dramatic configuration. Both Achilles and Odysseus are found in- consistent in their words, but Odysseus is so voluntarily; and this, paradoxically, leads to the conclusion that Odysseus is the better man. Yet we are also led to sense that Socrates, the better of the two interlocutors, is the true Achilles, the man who, according to the Apology, prefers early death to an inglorious life,"9 the warrior whose exploit is commemorated in the Symposium, while the por- trait of Hippias is a satirical comment on Odysseus' proverbial resourcefulness (roXvqxrlavLa).20 The immediate objective of this meaningful ambiguity is to show that the Homeric polarity of Achilles and Odysseus, or Achilles and Nestor, the knower and the 18 485e.

Nobody will take the derogatory remarks on Achilles in the Hippias Minor as a straightforward expression of Plato's opinion. Are we perhaps allowed to understand the quotation of the famous line on Achilles' return to Phthia (37ob) as an ironical cross-reference to Crito 44b? 20 There are still other places in Plato's dialogues where Odysseus or Nestor are forced into a somewhat disreputable association with the Sophists. In Phaedrus 261b the rhetoric of Gorgias, Thrasymachus, and Theodorus is ironically fathered on those two heroic figures; and in the Hippias Major, 286b, the swaggering sophist puts his wisdom in Nestor's mouth.</page><page sequence="10">IO Helmut Kuhn doer, must be revised. But there is still a subtler implication in this literary play. Plato's own adaptation of the myth is marked off against its parallel modernized version current among the Sophists. It is Callicles, a politician associated with the Sophists, who in the Gorgias contrasts the active Zethus and the contemplative Am- phion. Similarly Hippias sets Achilles the best man over against Nestor the wisest.21 As in the first case Socrates is revealed to be Zethos and Amphion in one, the true politician and the true thinker, so in the second the unity of virtue and wisdom is pointed out. Plato, repudiating the sophistic dichotomy of the practical and the theoretical life, reverts to an antagonism closer to that repre- sented in tragedy. The one firmly anchored in the Divine opposes the multiform representatives of fluctuating life. Like Aeschylus, Plato discovers a forecast of his polar vision in the myth; and for both the tragedian and the philosopher the overthrow of the Titanic lawlessness by Zeus, the lord of an era of wisdom and justice, is the key-note of their symbolism.22 There is some truth in Hegel's assertion that the tragic character is both an individual and 'moral force,' the two welded into an indestructible unity.23 With this conception in mind, we may well look upon Socrates as a kinsman of Aeschylus' and Sophocles' heroes. He is truly one, firm amidst the dangers of the battle and in the face of imminent death, saying always "the same about the same," ironically disguising the adamantine quality of his mind behind a show of doubt and waver- ing.24 As Socrates stands before us in the dialogues, he seems a creation of Plato the tragedian-the Achilles of a new age, but also a scion of the stock of the tragic seers, an "awakener" and a "spur" like Tiresias, who roused Oedipus' and Creon's souls from their 21 Hipp. Min. 364c. 2 See below, pp. 35-36.

We are trying to find germs of Platonic wisdom in tragedy. But Plato scoffed at those who be- lieved they discovered any wisdom in tragedy.27 This reminder brings down upon us a host of related objections. Everyone knows Plato's scathing criticism of poetry, and this topic of his teaching, appalling to the lover of art by its rigidity, has been examined time and again, especially by recent critics. I shall not attempt either to rehash the familiar story or to submit a fresh version. But it is worth while noting that the tragedian bears the brunt of the attacks levelled at the tribe of the poets and imitators in general. He is specifically named to receive the verdict of expulsion from the ideal city;28 and where the great poets and lawgivers are classed with the true lovers of wisdom, we find the names of Homer, Hesiod, and Solon, but no mention of Aeschylus or Sophocles is made.29 The judgment passed on those imitations which are "at three removes" from the model hits the tragedian's work with a twofold condem- nation. In addition to its remoteness from truth it is mimetic in the specific sense that differentiates dramatic representation from narration.30 It compels the actor to assume an attitude not his own and speak borrowed words, thus splitting up his personality. Yet to be truly one should be the goal of all our endeavors. To make things worse, the tragic actor is made to imitate unholy actions such as Oedipus' incest.31 Imitation is the human way of partaking of goodness as well as of the reverse. The faulty ideas about gods, demigods, and heroes are common to all poets. But these errors are more injurious in him who induces others to give, by bodily move- ments and uttered words, a semblance of reality to his calumnious 25 Cf.

Furthermore the tragedian, follower of an "effemi- nate Muse,"32 is charged with showing his heroes indulging in ver- bose lamentation. The hearers, moved to sympathetic suffering, respond with a similar discharge of emotion, setting aside the self- constraint which decency imposes on the well-bred.33 This objec- tion is tantamount to a negation of the essence of tragedy. Tragic lament and tragic suffering are as inseparable from each other as emotion and expressive gesture. We cannot repudiate the one with- out rejecting the other. According to Aristotle's judicious remark tragic suffering is the suffering of one whose guilt is slight compared with his misery. This alarming disproportion, inexplicable to reason, is usually con- nected in the mind of the tragedian with the idea of a divine author- ship or rather co-authorship. Man is caught in a net woven out of free choice, fatal necessity, and divine instigation, and there is no means of disentangling these threads. But this view of human life runs counter to two of Plato's basic convictions. First, to ascribe to the godhead any measure of causation of evil is blasphemy; and second, the disproportion of desert and happiness is mere sem- blance. Happiness and goodness are one. Therefore it is a scandal to say, as Aeschylus does, that god sends guilt to the mortals when he has set his mind on ruining a house.34 In the last analysis, the ignorance of the tragedian is responsible for the shortcomings of his creations. His incompetence in the very matter with which he deals is clearly shown by the fact that he specializes in the representation of allegedly noble characters, leaving it to the comedian to depict the mean and despicable. But as in medical knowledge the compe- tent student has a discernment both of health and sickness, so in every art the knowledge of the specific good implies the knowledge of its contrary: iLa bbva.us rcov pvavrclv. The fragmentariness of the tragedian's art casts a doubt on its soundness. If it were based on an authentic insight into human nobility, it would be one with the art of the comedian.35 As it actually is, it is unable to give a faithful picture of the "tragedy and comedy of life.""3 m Laws, 817d. 33 Rep. 605cd. 34 Rep. 380a; Aeschylus, Niobe, fr. 16o. u Rep. 395a; Symposium, 223d. 36 Philebus, 50b.</page><page sequence="13">The True Tragedy: Greek Tragedy and Plato, I 13 So it appears that Plato, if he ever took lessons from the trage- dians, was a most ungrateful pupil. The fire that according to the anecdote consumed his youthful essays in tragedy seems to have burned out whatever early attachment to the master tragedians may have been in his heart. If, in a survey of all explicit references to tragedy in Plato's writings, we deduct the polemic ones, very few are left, most of them insignificant. From the point of view of our thesis this is discouraging. It is the more so as the arguments so far advanced in its favor are open to two objections. (i) Sophocles, one may argue, has probably learned from Protagoras and Gorgias and, as a result, the analogies between the tragedian and Plato might be due to the indebtedness of both to the Sophistic Move- ment. (2) However dramatic we take Plato's dialogues to be, we should not overlook the gulf separating the Greek drama, which is a unity of poetry, pageantry, and music, from works of literature such as the Platonic dialogues. We have also to admit that the dialectic form in Plato is dramatic only in a limited way. The most momentous happening imaginable within the Platonic world, the act in which, on Plato's own premises, thought and life are com- pletely blended, has never been dramatized by Plato. Sophocles, who had a notion of this act, called it 'conversion,' /.irayvWovaL37-an expression which comes close to the leravoedv of the New Testament. In Plato it is described as a turning round (tcrrp~Ev or TrepLta-wyy) of the whole soul from darkness to light,38 or as the choice of one of the two patterns of life laid up in heaven." This omission should be ascribed neither to chance nor to a lack of artistic capability. It rather points to the chief purpose of Plato's writings-a purpose which differs from that of any other kind of dramatic or mimetic representation. Plato was not interested in dramatizing the human event of paramount importance, the change of heart, but rather in bringing it about by initiating a dialectical process in the mind of the reader. A gulf, it is true, separates Plato's dialogues from tragedy. But as contrast in some and kinship in other respects go together, it may be possible to offset the above arguments by a series of counter- 31 Pkiloctetes, 1270. 38 Rep. 518c, 521C. 31 Theaetetus, I 76e.</page><page sequence="14">14 Helmut Kuhn arguments. Another set of objections, however, will seem to carry even more weight than those just advanced. Reviewing a number of formal analogies, we seem to have relapsed into treating tragedy as a mere medium-a medium or vehicle, namely, not of ideas, Orphic, Pythagorean, or otherwise, but of literary forms. Further- more, the adduced analogies, in so far as they go beyond a formal correspondence, bring up the problem of a second causal agency op- erative beside or rather behind tragedy: the myth. Admitted that the dramatic antagonism is parallel in various respects to the tragic conflict, yet a different interpretation may be placed upon this fact. The antithetical conception of the world is older than tragedy and it stretches beyond poetry. It is not enough to assert that the philosophical dialogue resumes and transforms the tragic struggle. Both tragedy and comedy on the one hand, and the Platonic dia- logue on the other, may be said to express at different levels of thought a conflict the genetic prototype of which is found in the Agon of the Dionysiac Sacer Ludus.40 The metaphysical dualism, asserting itself throughout the history of the Greek mind, may have taken its first shape in the contest between protagonist and an- tagonist in prehistoric spring festivals. Tragedy and comedy, thoroughly though they refined on this mimetic raw-material, pre- served the antiphonic pattern. The antagonism is reflected in the polar notions of Ionian cosmology, in the dualism of the Pythag- oreans and the Eleatics,41 in the Sophistic dialectic, and it finally reaches its consummate spiritualization in the struggle of Socrates against the Sophists as staged by Plato. The genealogical line traced from Plato backward does not terminate in tragedy. As we face these objections, we have to admit that so far our argument is not conclusive. Taken by themselves, the formal analogies are doubtful witnesses. To make them eloquent and, within reasonable limits, trustworthy, we have to read their testi- 40 Gilbert Murray, "On the Ritual Forms Preserved in Greek Tragedy," in Jane E.

The mean- ing of a form, and also of a formal analogy, depends upon the whole of which the form is a manifestation. We have to ask whether there is a causal relationship between the essential meaning of tragedy and the gist of Plato's writings. A brief remark on the two types of 'causal relationship' and causal assertions in historiography may here find its place. First, the historian may single out a number of units, A, B, . . . , each unit standing for an 'event' in the broadest sense of the word, and then state the dependence of B upon A. In the second place, he may combine a large number of such dependent units into a comprehen- sive pattern which, if directed toward a goal, is called development. In order to point out that B is caused by A he has to locate both within this developmental scheme. The two types include each other. Assertions of the first are meaningful only in their context; and an exclusive attention to the second tends to suppress the indi- vidual as a center of spontaneous activity. The statement "Plato took the Prometheus motif in the Gorgias from Aeschylus" is an instance of the first type. The other is illustrated by a quotation from Professor Jaeger's Paideia which, incidentally, has a bearing on our specific problem. "It seems a short and inevitable journey from Pindar to Plato, from the aristocracy of race to the aristocracy of spirit and intelligence; but the transition can be made only through Aeschylus."42 In the following pages the available evidence for the direct and elementary kind of causality must be carefully examined. For obvious reasons, however, I shall have to lean heavily on the more complex arguments of the second type. In the light of these elucidations the argument just adduced as an objection-the one taken from the history of Greek ritual and myth -will now be seen to support our view and to supply a rudimentary frame-work for our further analysis. The development of a meta- physical antagonism may be viewed as the axis in the scheme of our historical topology. It would be our task to determine the places occupied on this line by tragedy and Platonic philosophy respec- tively. There may be a growth of some fundamental insight, the maturation of some dominant thought. Tragedy may mark an 42Op. cit. (see n.

The harshness of Plato's verdict implies an acknowledgment of the might of poetry. This obvious statement has been abundantly insisted upon by recent critics. It has also been pointed out that Plato, strictly speaking, condemns not so much poetry but rather certain types of poetry, everything, it is true, that in his day went under this name. For Plato the idea of an "ancient feud between poetry and philosophy"43 had a very massive and by no means metaphorical meaning. Plato desired to supplant the traditional poetic Logos with his novel dialectical Logos. The praise of the life of the blessed ones, men or gods, the main subject recommended to poets for treatment in the ideal state, is properly to be performed only by dint of that masterful control of the language in the right fitting together of words (Apyovlct Xb'-yov) which, according to the Theaetetus,44 the philosophical mind alone is apt to achieve. Con- ceived as a celebration of true perfection,45 the philosophical dis- course assumed a task that formerly fell to the poet. Accordingly Plato was bent on superseding the tragedy of the stage by the genu- ine tragedy. "We ourselves," the Athenian in the Laws is made to say, "to the best of our ability are the authors of a tragedy at once superlatively fair and good; at least, all our polity is framed as a representation (4uyiots) of the fairest and best life, which is in reality, as we assert, the truest tragedy."46 We shall venture to take this assertion as literally as we possibly can. Under its guidance we may discover Plato improving on a scheme of thought which he found in tragedy. The scheme of thought in question is a total view of human life, and Plato evidently believed that life as reflected in tragedy is not "the fairest and best life." This does not mean that in his own ver- sion of the great theme evil was to be omitted. It is impossible, we read in the Theaetetus,47 that evils should ever be done away with, for "there must always be something opposed to the good." But 43 Rep. 607b. 44 176a. 45 Timaeus I9d. 46 Laws 817b. 4~ 176a.</page><page sequence="17">The True Tragedy: Greek Tragedy and Plato, I I 7 the evil must be assigned its proper place, banished as it is from the divine and confined to hovering about mortal nature. So the resto- ration of life to its beauty and excellence is not an arbitrary embel- lishment. Plato wishes to rectify an error committed by the tra- gedians. Their error, expressed in the language of the myth, con- sisted in this, that they granted evil a seat among the gods. Tragedy as mirroring human life is first of all a picture of human happiness and misery and of the agencies bringing about the one and the other. There have been endless controversies as to the na- ture of these agencies and the tragic guilt; and idealistic expositors urge us to take tragedy as a vindication of human freedom upheld in the teeth of Necessity.48 The inconclusiveness of these debates warns us not to seek in tragedy intellectual decisions whose logical inevitability the pre-Socratic mind found it possible to ignore. Yet this much can be asserted: tragedy, on the whole, knows of three agencies, the human will, the divine will, and Fate. But neither in the general scheme of things nor in any particular case can the pro- portionate contribution of each of these three factors be ascertained. They are amazingly entangled and interwoven. Take Orestes' matricide in the Oresteia. After a painful inner struggle Orestes makes up his mind and does the deed-his deed, "willed by my hands," but at the same time "willed by the gods," by Apollo namely, under whose guidance the mortal acts.49 But there is still a third partner involved: Fate, an inexorable necessity that drives the members of the cursed house into mutual slaughter. In some cases Fate seems predominant, in others the divine intervention, in a third class man's own choice. But none of these three factors is ever wholly absent. There seems to be little room for freedom in Oedipus Rex. The disastrous truth gradually unveiled in the drama is a truth about things of the past. There is no undoing of the things done. And even while they were being done, they were done blindly, in the night of a fatal ignorance. But the human will is none the less powerfully exhibited. The unveiling of the truth is Oedipus' own work, his the feverish search for the author of the present misery ending in the discovery of himself. And again, when 48 Cf.

In point of fact, the question of the moral quality of the three causal agencies admits as little of a clear answer as the problem of their relative efficacy. There is no massive dualism of the powers of light and the powers of darkness in Greek poetry. As we may expect, man can act both ways, as a knave or as a hero. The duality of the superhuman powers, of the gods on the one hand and Fate on the other, does not express the contrast between good and evil either. In a great many cases it is not even possible to tell the works of the Olympians from those of Necessity. The intervention of Fate strikes men's hearts with terror but also with awe. Fate or Necessity comprises both Ate, a malig- nant power of destruction, and Moira, a principle of the proportion- ate allotment of 'shares,' and also of order, equilibrium, and retri- bution. As such it is invested with a moral or rather judicial dig- nity, giving effect to a universal lex talionis: "For a murderous blow let a murderous blow be struck. Let the doer suffer!"5' On the other hand, we are told that nothing happens, neither good nor evil, that is not sent by the gods.52 How, then, is it possible to exonerate the gods? Plato appears as the Alexander cutting the Gordian knot. To him the godhead is flawless perfection, fount of the good and of the good alone.53 This conviction, however, does not dispense with Necessity, the condition though not the sufficient cause of evil. Necessity, with Plato, is "open to persuasion.""54 In vain shall we look in Plato's dialogues for an explicit metaphysical account of the origin of evil. But on the moral plane his position is of the ut- most clarity. God has no share in man's wrongdoing. Man alone is to blame. This is the message of Lachesis, the "daughter of Neces- sity," solemnly proclaimed to the souls as they are about to pick a "pattern of life": "The responsibility (alia) is with the chooser. 50 Ag. 1497-1508.

Similarly the Demiurge in the Timaeus, when he creates the immortal part of the human soul, takes care to secure an equal chance to every one, to the end "that he might be guiltless of the future wickedness of any of them."56 On the metaphysical level this uncompromising attitude entails far-reaching conclusions. As the world is ruled by the Good, there must be a perfect equilibrium of desert and reward, or of moral goodness and happiness. This belief is imperatively needed to re- store the balance in the moral world revolutionized by Plato's thought. No subterfuge and no excuse is left for the agent to shirk full responsibility, no all-powerful fate, no ineluctable curse, no Ate. He is faced squarely with his guilt and must acknowledge it as his own. But in return he derives a new benefit from his good actions. They also become emphatically his own, and neither chance nor fatality will dispute him the fruits of his virtue. He shall live a life of his own choosing. The ideals of total responsibility and total retribution are con- tradicted by common experience, and Plato has to enforce his view by what seems an act of violence. Common experience shows the vast influence on human actions of factors beyond human control, of innate character and given circumstances. The tragic ideas of Heimarmene, Ate, and the like thrive in the opaque intermediate sphere between human agency and stolid factuality. Plato denies the existence of this sphere. To him the coercive power of the 'type of life' which a person lives (this notion of Ptos embraces both character and circumstances, or mode of behavior and environ- ment) is a mere semblance. The seemingly irresistible springs of our wrongdoing stem from errors committed in a former incarnation. The misery of the just, a fact writ large in the memory of mankind, is a fact only within the narrow horizon of our ephemeral existence. The reward will come, either in this life or hereafter. Plato's view here collides with that embodied in tragedy. This conflict (which is at the same time a conflict with common sense) drives Plato into a new type of poetry competing with, and in its main tendency anti- thetical to, tragedy. The contradictions arising from the twin ideas of total responsibility and total retribution are insoluble if we con- ` Rep. 617e. "5 Tim. 42d, tr. Cornford.</page><page sequence="20">20 Helmut Kuhn sider birth and death as the absolute bounds of human life. The myth of a pre-natal and posthumous existence of the soul images forth a truth which mere reasoning is unable to grasp. Considered as a dogma, the idea of metempsychosis pushes the problem into a remote past and far-off future instead of solving it. Only if we read it as poetry, that is, as pointing to a truth rather than clothing it in imagery, does the myth become meaningful. Plato himself indicates the difference between his poetic myth and poetry in the ordinary sense of the word. "Not that I have a low opinion of poets in general," Socrates is made to say in the Timaeus, "but anyone can see that an imitator, of whatever sort, will reproduce best and most easily the surroundings in which he has been brought up."''7 The philosopher has been brought up in an environment different from that which nourished the poet's im- agination. His mind has matured in the contact with everlasting objects, located in the outermost heaven and the region beyond, "a place which no poet here has ever sung nor will sing worthily ever." So the philosopher alone is fitted to celebrate the newly dis- covered perfection of life. The Orphic idea of a transmigration of the soul is more than a patch-work of imagery covering up a gap in the argument. It has a "perspective" significance. Once we embrace it, the facts adverse to Plato's view-the apparent fatality responsible at least for certain misdeeds, and the apparent misery of at least some people who deserve better-begin to shrink. Placed within an infinitely enlarged temporal horizon, they are dwarfed and seem illusory. Tragedy, and poetry in general, takes very seri- ously the affairs of this life of ours, limited as it is by birth and death. The Platonic poetry is animated by the conviction that "no human affairs are worth taking very seriously."'8 The deception that makes us tragically declaim and lament over an alleged dispro- portion between merit and happiness is one of perspective or view- point. The harmony of justice and happiness, poetically symbolized in the Orphic-Platonic myth, is manifest only to the just. He alone possesses the right measuring-rod for discerning and appraising true pleasure and true pain.59 The point argued here is that Plato's philosophy is not only un- 57 i9d, tr.

Aristotle thinks the misfortune should be brought upon the tragic hero not by vice or depravity but by some failure or tripping (1uAaprta), as it may easily occur in a man neither pre-eminently virtuous nor wicked.60 The under- lying observation is that a disproportion exists between cause and effect, between guilt and resulting catastrophe. Reduced to this form, the remark is borne out by all the extant tragedies. Pro- metheus' rebellious defiance, Oedipus' petulance and irascibility, Ajax' overweening pride-all these shortcomings and errors are far outweighed by the disaster which they conjure up. In other cases it is hard to discover any guilt at all. Tragedy does not and cannot exhibit that just balance of happiness and merit, misery and guilt which Plato requires. Its meaning is not resolvable into a moral calculus. Prometheus' last words are echoed throughout Greek tragedy: "Behold what pangs unjust I bear." It is characteristic for the tragic hero to act and to suffer in the face of the ineradicable opacity of the moral order. This opacity is keenly and painfully felt by most of Aeschylus' heroes, while Sophocles' serene mind seems less troubled by it. But his devout acquiescence in the mystery impresses us even more strongly with a sense of its pres- ence than Aeschylus' struggling after clarity. The just punishment inflicted upon a malefactor does not arouse the tragic pathos. This is the unwritten law strictly adhered to by the tragedians. Over against this view Plato sets his antithesis. There is but one true misery, injustice. The transgression and its penalty are one. There is no more fearful affliction than that of being condemned to a life of injustice. In accordance herewith Plato depicts the wretchedness of the pursuit of pleasure for pleas- ure's sake-the life symbolized by the leaking jar, incessantly filled 6o Poetics, 1453a, 7-1o.</page><page sequence="22">22 Helmut Kuhn and emptied, frustration wedded to desire in eternal alternation.6' Portraying the hero of depravity, in the Gorgias and in the ninth book of the Republic,62 the untamed lion and the ruler stung by the hornet of the perverted Eros, Plato invests him with the gloomy splendor of fallen greatness-a note almost unheard of in earlier Greek literature. Aeschylus' Clytemnestra and Euripides' Medea are among the rare parallels which come to our mind. But firmly though Plato held up the principles of his moral theodicy, he was not blind to that 'perspective illusion' which perturbs us with the spectacle of suffering innocence and triumphant crime. There is no doubt in his mind about the inevitability of this delusion and the fearful sway it wields over mankind. He also did not flatter himself with the dream of a mankind ultimately raised to that clarity of philosophical insight which dispels the spectre of a world incongruous to the moral postulate. Thus he felt constrained to face an experience with which the poets were intimately conversant and of which they tried to make sense in their own way. Plato, taking up this ancient subject, radically reverses the position as- sumed by those before him. But we shall see that this opposition to the poets and especially to the tragedians brings him close to his opponents. The antagonism reveals kinship. Antigone's last words, just like those of Prometheus, refer to the wrong she suffers: What law of the gods did I violate? How can I look to heaven? On whom Call to befriend me? seeing that I have earned By piety the meed of impious?63 Ajax dies with a curse for his enemies and an invocation of the demons of revenge on his lips. Oedipus insists on his innocence: what he did was done involuntarily.4 There is no reconciliation in the mind of these sufferers. This is not to say that the insoluble problem of a moral theodicy is predominant in any of Aeschylus' or Sophocles' tragedies. The contention is that it is absent in none of them. It often seems merely a concomitant feature, an aspect of that other truth repeatedly proclaimed by tragedy in unison with 61 Gorgias, 493ab. 62 Gorgias, 484a, Rep. 571-580. 63 Antig. 922-924, tr. Campbell. 64 Oed. Col. 522.</page><page sequence="23">The True Tragedy: Greek Tragedy and Plato, I 23 Greek poetry as a whole-the truth of the preponderance of suffer- ing in human life."6 But even so the question of right and wrong remains inseparably linked with the meaning of all tragic acting and suffering. Tragedy reveals man on the verge of being engulfed by excessive tribulations. The suffering, however, is not merely the acute pain caused by some concrete calamity, nor is it the despair alone of one who deems life not worth living because of the excess of sorrow over joy. Tragic suffering is ennobled by the anxiety of such questions as: Does all this happen to me of right? Nothing comes about against the will of the gods. But how, then, do they allow an injustice to pass such as has overtaken me now? In tragedy, the direct and pragmatic suffering and 'the suffering from suffering,' the primary affliction and the perplexity at the apparent disproportion of the moral order, are inextricably one. Without its metaphysical overtones the effusive lament, melodiously though it be expressed, would be dull or repellent. The tragic struggles have to be fought in the dark-amidst the night of human ignorance with regard to the meaning of the things to be done or to be suffered. The reality of this suffering cannot be explained away as a per- spective illusion dissolving in the light of a deeper insight. To make progress in wisdom rather means to learn how to face this reality without wincing. It is this unwavering recognition of the reality of suffering that earned the tragedians Nietzsche's applause and sug- gested to him the conception of a tragic age of Greek civilization brought to an end by Socrates' rationalism. But the tragedian's outlook on life is as little pessimistic in Schopenhauer's and Nietzsche's sense as Socrates or Plato are votaries of an 'optimistic rationalism.' Man in tragedy attains to wisdom through affliction. "Taught by suffering" (rh0EL &amp; 0o0s)66 is the pointed expression of this belief. The school of affliction leads to an acquiescence in the will of the gods. On the intellectual plane, the supreme act of ac- 6 S. H.

In spite of all evidence to the con- trary, Justice and Necessity are one in Zeus. In the affirmation of this faith the tragic insight reaches its consummation. The 'in spite of' should be stressed. Evil and suffering remain what they were, the skeins of causation are not disentangled, no light is shed on the contradictions which trouble the mind eager to understand and to justify. The knowledge obtained embraces and reconciles the logically incompatible. It is the fruit of sorrow, not to be di- vulged in rational terms, given him alone who has paid the price of suffering. The hearer, imaginatively sharing the sorrow, is ad- mitted to an imaginative fruition of the gain. The catharsis which he experiences is the correlate of the tragic hero's 'mournful wis- dom.' The tragic wisdom is an initiation into human suffering rather than its moral justification or a theoretical minimizing of its reality. Oedipus Rex is particularly revealing in this respect. On the sur- face the struggle is between an inexorable fate and its victim, great in will-power and yet utterly helpless. Fate has already done its work when the play starts, and the plot is the successive unveiling of its verdict. The revelation of the past has a deeper meaning than that of impressing us with a sense of the immutability of the de- crees of Fate. It is at the same time the destruction of a semblance and the revelation of a truth, a demonic interplay of the Eleatic contraries of seeming (&amp;oKECPv) and being (elvat).6 The glory of Oedi- pus the king, father, and savior of his people as shown in the open- ing scene is revealed as a brittle appearance built on illusion. As it crumbles, truth celebrates its sombre triumph. In Aeschylus' Suppliants, the king of Argos would prefer the ignorance of im- pending evils to a painful foresight.68 This is only a faint anticipa- tion of the Gorgonean face of truth in Oedipus Rex. "Was there ever a man who from happiness snatched more than its semblance, and who, having seemed happy, did not decline?"69 To bring home to us the significance of the progress from illusion to a dire knowl- edge, the poet indulges in a meaningful play with the analogy of the 67 Traces of this polarity in Aeschylus: cf. Septem 592, Ag. 787, 840; Choeph. 1053-1054; cf. also Plato, Rep. 36Ib. 68 450-1. 69 Oed.

When the blind seer Tiresias invokes "the strength of truth," Oedipus scornfully retorts that there is truth but Tiresias has no share in it: "You are blind, ears, mind, and eyes."70 But Oedipus is the one who "sees and sees not,"7' and when he finally learns how to see, he has to become physically blind, a "scion of night" like Tiresias.72 The symbolism which parallels and contrasts the inward and the physical light, used here and elsewhere by Sophocles as also by Aeschylus, Pindar, Parmenides, Empedocles, Epicharmus, and Gorgias,73 points forward to Plato's metaphysics of light and to his ideas of the "vision" and "eye" of the soul.74 The light visualized by the Platonic philosopher-a light which dispels the phantasma- goria of an undeserved suffering-is the strict counterpart to the tragic enlightenment which makes us plumb unspeakable depths of sorrow. If the tragic chorus in unison with Pindar and the lyric poets sings of happiness as shortlived and deceitful, Plato will counter with the assertion that their alleged happiness is fleeting and illusory indeed, because devoid of truth. To him the outcry of the tormented creature voiced in the tragic threnos will be an "idle moan,"75 bewailing the passing away of the unreal. In the Phaedo, the Platonic anti-tragedy, the wailing Xanthippe is removed on the spot, and Socrates rebukes his moaning friends. The fortitude of the true hero consists in the knowledge and discrimination of the things to be feared and those not to be feared.76 The things fearful in tragedy are divested of their fearfulness by philosophical insight.

This is to be gleaned from Aristotle's memorial verses on the deceased master which celebrate him as the one who "sole or first among mortals revealed it clear to sight, by his own life and by the investigations of his discourses, that man becomes happy if he becomes good. But now it is not possible for anyone to attain this."78 In tragedy, suffering and fear are relieved by their poetical ex- pression. The tragic dread looms large in all the extant plays. The poets take advantage of a craving in human nature blandly con- fessed by the Oceanids in Prometheus Bound. They eagerly wish to "share the pleasure" of hearing Io relate her "dolorous fortunes."79 When the Athenian listened to a tragic performance he was in- dulging in the same type of pleasure. He was made to feel that the compassion and terror filling his own mind were one with the sym- pathetic vibration of the whole world. Thus an outlet was afforded for his own oppressive fears. The universality of terror and pity brings about that pleasurable unburdening of the soul which Aris- totle described as catharsis. Although Plato denied the factual basis of the tragic fear and rejected the artistic cure provided by the poets, he did not under- rate the ascendancy over the human mind of this fear and of the ideas with which it was associated. Convinced as he was that in- telligence (vois) is shared "only by the gods and a small number of men,"80 he could not rest content with a theoretical refutation of the tragic notion of evil. As a political thinker he had to contrive a remedy to supersede the tragic catharsis. This political or educa- 77 In Platonis Timaeum Commentaria, ed. E.

Tragic poetry implies a certain idea of human happiness and human misery. The sway of this idea over the human mind is due to its appeal to the emotions, that is, to pleasure and pain. The poet's idea of happiness will determine the nature of this emotional response on the part of the listeners. They will rejoice at the things enjoyable to the poet, pity what he thinks pitiable, sympathetically weep over what he considers doleful. So the poet arrogates to him- self the guidance of the public mind, directing it at his pleasure. He dabbles in what Plato regards as the chief concern of the philo- sophical legislator. In the dialogue intended to present 'the truest tragedy' we read: "Any speculation about laws turns almost en- tirely on pleasure and pain, both in states and in private characters: these are two fountains which nature lets flow, and he who draws from them where and when and as much as he ought, is happy; ... and he who indulges in them ignorantly and in excess, is the reverse of happy."81 Pleasure and pain are the first perceptions of children and the forms "under which virtue and vice are originally present to them."82 Education, therefore, is a "training in respect of pleasure and pain, which leads you always to hate what you ought to hate, and love what you ought to love."" The goal and consummation of this process is the art of correctly measuring pleasure and pain, an art which results from our partaking of truth.84 But the attainment of such knowledge is a privilege of few, and even they arrive at it only late in life. So man on the whole may be viewed as a "puppet of the gods," pulled back and forth, right and left by the iron strings of his desires and fears.A Added to this is a golden wire, the principle of law and reason. How can we aid the soft metal so that it prevails over the strong and hard? There is only one way to solve this problem. We must see to it that the iron wires pull in the same direction as the golden one; in non-metaphorical language, we must supply pleasures which, though unreasoned in themselves, are in accord with reason.

This activity, described in modern terms, is a union of religious rite and art; and viewed as art it combines poetry, music, dance, and perhaps also the mimetic art. It is divided into three perform- ances: sacrificing, singing, and dancing. All three direct the soul toward the divine source of perfection. But the contact thus estab- lished is not that immediate and creative participation in the su- preme Reality which is a prerogative of the philosophical vision alone. Those holy artistic exercises are not fulfilment but prepara- tion or rather education (7rateia), a constraining and directing of the juvenile mind toward reason as affirmed by law. The soul, delicately susceptible to the impress of harmony and rhythm, is thus habituated to rejoice and sorrow at the same things which, later in life, rational insight may reveal to it as truly joyful or sorrowful.86 "Incantations" (irq7yal) are needed to coax the mind into that happy condition which it is not yet able to bring about by a free act of reasonable choice. An ambiguity lurks behind the Platonic conceptions of education, and Plato points to it by a pun on the words 7ratbela-Trat&amp;d. Con- sidering the small number of those who ever attain rational insight, the preparatory training, for the majority of the citizens, turns into an end in itself, a 'consummatory' occupation. Education (Tratbela) becomes play (7ratbdL). It is doubtful whether man has been de- signed by the gods for "some serious purpose" (and this means, for philosophy) or rather as their plaything (7ralyLtov).87 There is, Plato insists, no contempt in this expression. To be the plaything of the gods is, truly considered, the best of man. It is incumbent on the lawgiver to make the movements of the human puppets fall into the pattern that reason prescribes, thus setting up a show worthy of the divine master of the play.88 This reverses the current opinion about play and earnest. Dancing and singing are revealed not as a pastime, a pleasurable pausing from the serious business of life, but rather as the only thing to be performed in full earnest, the flowering and consummation of life. Plato condemns the conven- 88 Ibid. 659de. 87 Ibid. 644d. 88 Ibid. 803c.</page><page sequence="29">The True Tragedy: Greek Tragedy and Plato, I 29 tional forms of the imitative arts only to put a sacred art into the core of the ideal state.89 The notion of man as a plaything of the gods is not entirely new in the history of the Greek mind. We recall Theognis who contrasts the vanity of human planning and striving and the power of the gods "achieving everything after their own mind."90 But nowhere are men so clearly shown to be pawns in the hands of demonic players as in tragedy. Until it degenerated into a stage trick, tragic irony gave a dramatic expression to this idea. Clytemnestra offering her criminal prayer to Apollo at the very moment when the avenger of Agamemnon, sent by Apollo, prepares her death; or the exultation of the chorus at the softening of the mind of its lord Ajax, while he in reality is firmly bent on dying-such are the inane movements of the human puppet agitated by hope and fear and performing its part in ignorance of the plot, of its outcome as well as of its meaning. The Oedipus Rex is wholly pervaded by this ironic game. It begins far back, with the attempt to circumvent the oracle which foretold Oedipus' destiny. The circumvention turns into an instrument of fulfilment. Then the lurid light of this irony plays on every step taken by Oedipus, yea, on his very existence. The man who solved the riddle of the Sphinx-the riddle of the nature of man-is ignorant of himself. He curses him who polluted the land by an unholy deed, and unwittingly curses himself. He derides the seer's blindness, and unknowingly mocks at his own future self. The more he struggles to escape the meshes of suspicion, the tighter the entanglement closes down upon him, till Iocasta's desperate attempt to hide the truth finally reveals it. However, for both the tragedian and Plato the idea of the puppet is not a last word in matters of human nature. The tragic hero as well as the Platonic philosopher may rise above the push and pull of uncon- trollable forces. But Plato thinks the show of human helplessness should not be exposed to the sympathetic shudder of the multitude -a spectacle devoid of reality. Instead, the statesman and phi- losopher should try to gather up the loose ends of the variegated 89 Cf. G. M.

We all strive after pleasure and shrink from pain, and whenever we have to choose, we infallibly prefer the life that promises the greatest excess of pleasure over pain."9 But pleasure and pain, unguided by true opinion or reason, are "foolish counsellors.""9 Debauched by the ideas of the many about good and evil, man will come to conceive of the just and the pleasant life as alternatives, as if in choosing the one he had to abandon the other. Thus he falls into the worst kind of ignorance: he will hate that which neverthe- less he thinks to be good and noble.93 It is the duty of the legislator to inculcate the basic truth that the just life is one with the pleas- antest life. This is the device which enables him to operate the iron wires in conformity with the tug of the golden thread. The opposite view, divorcing pleasure from justice, is termed "the most disgraceful of notions" (aaoXLros 6ywv),94 and the ruler will inflict "the heaviest penalties on anyone in all the land who should dare to say that there are bad men who lead pleasant lives, or that the profitable and gainful is one thing, and the just another.""9 These are appalling statements, even if we take into account that they are designed to apply to life in an ideal community rather than to human existence at large. Tragedy seems to be much closer to life such as we believe we know it. Although far from exhibiting the triumph of evil, the tragedian uses the disproportion between suffering and guilt as a mainspring of the tragic emotion and thereby brings upon himself Plato's violent rebuttal. At the same time, the clash of views reveals an identity of the point of departure. Plato, in this context, views the human being not as a potential philosopher but as a sensorium exposed to the impact of powerful emotions, as the theatre-goer on whose sensibility the poet plays. Man, in this condition, may well be likened to a marionette, placed as he is at the mercy of the one who knows how to elicit the desired emotional response. This is the frame of mind, the normal condition of the average citizen, and even more so the status of the 91 Laws, 733ab. 92 Ibid. 644c. 93 Ibid. 689a. 4 Ibid. 663b. 15 Ibid. 662a.</page><page sequence="31">The True Tragedy: Greek Tragedy and Plato, I 31 young and inexperienced soul, of which the statesman must take advantage. Now he must try his hand and mould the plastic mind. He knows that the truth which he desires to impress on the mal- leable stuff sounds harsh and that it seems to be contradicted by common experience. But as there is no other salvation either for the state or for the individual, he will spare no pain in performing the work of persuasion. By music and verse he will cast a spell on the impressionable mind, he will invent new myths giving color and vivacity to his point, he will compel the poets to depict the misery of the unjust, even though he possess riches passing those of Cinyras or Midas;96 he will use all his efforts to make the whole community, regarding this master belief, "utter one and the same word in their songs and tales and discourses all their life long.""97 Even if all this were not so, if no such perfect harmony of happiness and merit did actually exist, he still would have to maintain his proposition as the most salutary lie-a lie that makes the citizens "do what is right, not on compulsion but voluntarily.""9 If we ask where we shall find the poets willing to sing such lawful songs, Plato, with unambiguous words, points to his own literary art. We are not in want of a pattern, the Athenian says, "for when I consider the words which we have spoken from early dawn until now,... they appear to me quite like a poem.""99 But the sweet voice of reason is monotonous. Socrates, teased by the Sophists on the score of his incessantly talking "about the same things," wittily replied: "Not only about the same, but the same about the same."'100 Likewise the stars, visible gods travelling imperturbably through their orbits, are so created by the Demiurge as to think eternally "the same about the same."''1 As, however, it may be wearisome to sing always "the same about the same," every sort of change and variation will be employed to take away the effect of sameness, so that the singers will take pleasure in their hymns and that "every man and boy, slave and free, both sexes and the whole city will never cease charming themselves with the strains of which we have spoken."'02 And the gist of all songs and tales shall be "that the life which is by the gods deemed to be the happiest is the 9s Ibid. 66oe. 97 Ibid. 664a. 98 Ibid. 663de. 9g Ibid. 8IIcd. 100 Gorgias, 490e; Xenophon, Mem.

The meaning of Plato's claim to present 'the truest tragedy' becomes clear when read in the light of these assertions. The author to whose mind any kind of authorship is at best a noble play'03 invites us to read his own works as poetry, though of a peculiar kind. Following his advice, we shall find this poetry de- voted chiefly to celebrating the identity of goodness and happiness. Plato's novel poetry is the fruit neither of a natural talent nor of an unaccountable demonic visitation.104 It has its roots in knowl- edge. As knowledge concerning polar structures always encom- passes the two opposite poles or contraries, the true tragedy is at the same time the true comedy. It presents with equal power both the characters better and those "worse than the average,"'05 Soc- rates as well as his sophistic adversaries. Again, as there is "one form of virtue, but innumerable forms of vice,"'06 we discover among the Platonic actors only one who measures up to the stature of the tragic hero, but a motley crowd of mock-heroes and fools. Eros is both the true poet and the source of poetry in others, Agathon asserts in the Symposium.'07 Agathon, of course, thinks of his own tragedies and of those of his illustrious masters. In his ignorance of the genuine Eros he utters a truth which he does not fully comprehend. Accepting his view of poetry (as we are naturally prone to do), we shall puzzle in vain over the unanswerable question whether or not Plato condemned poetry. The fact is that Plato did not recognize poetry as an eidos or essence. The tangible basis of his discussion is the art of "putting together words,"'0s no matter whether prose or verse, whether the artist is styled orator, or legis- lator, or poet, or what not. That which matters alone is whether the words are "genuine children" generated in the contact of the soul with the Ideas of the just, fair, and good. Then, whatever form of expression he chooses, the author deserves the title of a phi- losophos, a "lover of wisdom."'09 Fear (060jos), the predominant feeling in tragedy, receives its due honors also in Plato's rival creation.

But the fear to be cultivated in Plato's state is not the unreasoned terror at the working of a fatal necessity which, paradoxically, is assumed to annihilate and to lift up at one stroke; and the associate of fear, pity, seems to be banished altogether."0 Dionysus, the patron of tragedy, is invoked for a reformed service which breeds "that divine fear which we have called reverence and shame.""' Henry Thoreau once said about Aeschylus and the other Greek poets: "They ought not to have moved trees, but to have chanted to the gods such a hymn as would have sung all their old ideas out of their heads, and new ones in."112 A hymn of this kind was intoned by Plato. The causal nexus between tragedy and Platonic philosophy is largely but not solely a relation of thesis and antithesis. So far, our argument has one-sidedly stressed the antithetical element. To redress the balance we shall first point out a trend in tragic poetry which brings it close to the Platonic scheme of thought, so close that we may speak of a self-transcendence of tragic poetry in the direction of philosophy (iv-The Tragic Theodicy). In the second place I shall try to show that Plato took the tragic complication as a potentiality of human life much more seriously than it may have appeared from our examination of the Laws (v-The Philosophical Drama). iv-The Tragic Theodicy Among the tragic notions repudiated by Plato, two central con- ceptions stand out: the idea of Fate, and that of the envy or jealousy (0o6vos) of the gods. The first of the two, if conceived as an irrational power to which even the gods must bow, obviously runs counter to the spirit of Plato's thought. Only in so far as Fate involved the idea of expiation could it be domesticated by the 110 Laws, 936b.

The tale of "retributions of Heaven" related by the priests of old-we may think of the accursed house of the Atreidae--shall be retold to deter anyone who by "some fatality" (AOMXIa ov4,opat) should feel tempted to lay hands upon his father, or mother, or brethren, or children."3' Furthermore, Fate may be allied with Nemesis and then give effect to that universal law according to which any disturbance of the 'balance of powers' in the universe has to be compensated for by a counteraction. Thus the idea of fate links up with one of the great principles of Ionian cosmology from Anaximander on, and with the fundamental notion of nearly all Greek medicine; and the same idea of the disturbance and recovery of an equilibrium recurs in Plato, especially in his theory of the diseases of the body.114 There are traces of the 'divine jealousy' in tragedy. We recall Aeschylus' Agamemnon putting off his sandals before he steps on the purple cloth, "lest some far-off god cast on me envious eyes,"115 or the invocation of the god Phthonos in Sophocles' Philoctetes.116 To an advanced religious consciousness the notion is outrageous, and Plato, of course, has no use for it. The Demiurge in the Ti- maeus, it is true, takes special precautions to secure the difference between god and man."' But the laconic statement about the nature of the "father of all things" is an express negation of the ancient belief. "Being without jealousy," the universal father desired that "all things should come as near as possible to being like himself."118 "Envy is banished from the divine chorus," we read in the Phaedrus.119 However, the crude notion of a rivalry between divine and mortal beings is not endorsed by the tragedians either. Aeschylus, "with a lone voice," denies the belief that pros- perity necessarily breeds disaster.120 It is rather Nemesis, the idea mediating between the uncouth conception of envious demons and the sublime one of an omnipotent Justice, upon which Aeschylus' moral world hinges.121 The fatal curse, attaching to an individual 1n Laws, 872e-873a. 114 Tim. 82a. 115 Ag. 946, tr.

"The gods thoroughly hate insolence,"'22 and their jealousy intervenes as an executive power in the service of the universal order. "The state of prosperity (K6poS) is apt to produce insolence (iDj3pt) and impiety (bvaao3eta), and the man who gives way to these temptations is seized with the infatuation (ir7l) which will lead to his doom."123 There is still the god-given infatuation--an idea distasteful to Plato. But the pattern of thought as a whole distinctly tends toward a conception of the world as presided over by the divinely good. A play com- posed in strict adherence to this pattern (the nearest approach is the Persae) would, by Aristotelian standards, fall short of the re- quirements of a good tragic plot. As the final catastrophe would be presented as a just punishment, it would fail to arouse the tragic pity. But this deficiency might recommend it for admission to the Platonic state. Aeschylus' thought advances still further in the direction of Plato. It seems to be the idea of the Aeschylean trilogy to start in a world torn asunder by a conflict irreducible to moral terms; but then to rise to a vision which reconciles the course of events to the moral demands. For our yearning after a just and meaningful order of the world the Prometheus Bound, if taken by itself, is perturbing or even revolting. The poet's sympathy is all with the sufferer. Even his enemy Zeus is indebted to him. He has saved the life of mankind, he has made this life truly human by his gifts, and he did all this at his own peril. Zeus, on the other hand, appears cruel, irascible, and vindictive. His actions are largely prompted by an irritable concern for the safety of his throne. Yet Zeus is the lord of justice watching over the "attunement of things" (At6~ &amp;paovLa);124 and Prometheus' guilt is disputed by not even himself or the sym- pathetic mermaids. This is not only an extreme case of the 'moral disproportion.' The notion of guilt itself takes on that enigmatic tinge which encouraged the speculation about a 'guiltless guilt' cherished in the camp of modern idealistic expositors.

In the Prometheia, as in the Oresteia, he is concerned with the succession of divine dynasties, each representing a stage of the universal evolution.125 The young king has to maintain his rule both against the old king and his clan and against a possible usurper. In the Oresteia the ancient gods are the Eumenides, in the Prometheia Cronos and his Titans. Pro- metheus, himself a Titan, belongs by birth to the doomed world of ancient lawlessness. But if the outline of the trilogy as conjectured by the learned restorers is accurately drawn, the Zeus who releases and reconciles Prometheus in the Solutus is not the Zeus of the Vinctus. The interval of 30,000 years has matured him. Made wise by affliction, he has learned moderation and compassion. And Pro- metheus, in his turn, has learned how to accept the law above him. His suffering was not in vain either. Thus both the dramatic and the logical tensions were finally solved. If the complete trilogy had come down to us, we might have witnessed the growth of the su- preme god. Before our eyes Zeus might have risen from his tragic errors and entanglements to the height of the "benign father" of the Timaeus, or of the king of the Reign of Law of whom are said the words in the Critias: 06's E 6" OCCov Ze - v v'6ots flcaotXEcVl'.126 We shall have to return once more to the problems of the Pro- metheus Bound. For our present purpose the tentative and hypo- thetical interpretation of the Prometheia merely serves to adum- brate ideas clearly exhibited in the Oresteia. The parallelism be- tween this masterpiece of the ancient tragic art and Plato's un- finished triptych of which the Timaeus was to form a side-piece has been pointed out by Professor Cornford. The central part of his argument will be given in his own words.127 The first two parts of Aeschylus' trilogy, Agamemnon and the Choe- phoroe, develop in a world disrupted by irreconcilable conflicts. The Zeus wistfully invoked by the chorus-the king of supreme power, wisdom, and 125 A. O.

Agamemnon, bowing his head beneath 'the yoke of necessity,' started a disastrous train-the sacrifice of his daughter, Clytemnestra's revenge, Orestes' sanctioned murder of the murderess. The son, no less than the mother, could claim to be doing the work of Justice; but if justice means revenge, where is this chain of dutiful crimes to end? The answer is given in the Eumenides. Orestes, purified of guilt by Apollo himself, can yet find no peace in his soul. He is haunted and pur- sued by the Furies, hounded on by his mother's ghost, demanding blood for blood. The issue is brought to trial on the Hill of Ares, under the presidency of Athena, impersonating the wisdom of Zeus. Apollo comes to champion the cause of Orestes. He confronts the Furies with loathing and contempt. Neither party can yield an inch of its claim. Nor can human justice reach a decision: the votes are equal. Both sides are in the right, though both may also be in the wrong. Athena now gives her cast- ing vote for acquittal. Apollo vanishes; he has no more to say. The human protagonist, Orestes, is dismissed. The stage is left to the unappeased and furious spirits of vengeance, daughters of the Night or of the Earth Mother, and, on the other side, Athena, the motherless child of the Father. Divine Reason is face to face with Necessity. In wild confusion and desperate anger, the Furies threaten to blast the soil of Athens and poison the very springs of life. Athena turns to them and her first words are 'Be persuaded by me!' She offers them a sanctuary and worship in a cave under the Hill of Justice, where they may be trans- formed into powers of fertility and blessing. At first they cannot listen, but go on crying out for justice and revenge. Athena patiently repeats her offer. She reminds them that she alone knows the keys of that chamber where the thunderbolt is stored; 'but there is no need of that.' Violence will not remedy a situation that violence has created. Suddenly the Furies are converted, when Athena addresses their leader as follows: 'I will not weary of speaking good words. Never shall you say that you, the elder goddess, were cast out of this land by me, the younger, and by my mortal citizens, with dishonor. No; if you have any reverence for unstained Persuasion, the appeasement and soothing charm of my tongue-why then, stay here.' To this persuasion the daughters of Necessity yield at last. The play ends with the song in which they promise fertility to the soil and citizens of Athena's land, and with the cry of triumph: 'So Zeus and Destiny are reconciled.'128 Herewith we compare the outlines of Plato's trilogy Timaeus, Critias, HIermocrates, as they can be surmised on the basis of the 128 Cornford, op. cit. 362-363.</page><page sequence="38">38 Helmut Kuhn executed parts.129 The conversation in the Timaeus takes place on the occasion of the festival of Athena, and the subject broached in the introduction-the story of pre-historic Athens and its interne- cine warfare against Atlantis-is considered especially appropriate for that day. As Professor Cornford remarks, the formal speeches delivered at the Panathenaea "regularly recalled the leadership of Athens in the victory of Hellas over the barbarian invaders in the Persian wars."'13 On the previous day, Socrates has presented his notion of the ideal city. He now hopes to watch this city in motion, "putting forth her strength in such contests as a city will engage in against others."'3' Critias offers to meet Socrates' request by telling a myth about ancient Athens and Atlantis, thus transferring Socrates' ideal state and its citizens "from the region of theory to concrete fact."'32 But first a cosmic frame has to be set up for the historical drama, and this is done in the Timaeus. The Timaeus, planned as the first dialogue of a trilogy, is itself composed after a triadic scheme. First the works of Reason are revealed,'33 then all that which has come about by Necessity,34 and finally the cooperation of Reason and Necessity.'36 The Necessity as impersonated by Aeschylus' demons of vengeance contained the germs of justice, but it was unable to achieve a just order of society. Similarly Plato's Necessity, left to itself, is not wholly destitute of organization, and it even approximates to a differentiation accord- ing to elements."36 But in order that a cosmos could arise out of the purposeless play of unbalanced qualities, Necessity had to yield to the persuasion of Reason."' Like the human and natural cosmos in the Eumenides, so the orderly universe in the Timaeus results from the victory of reasonable persuasion over necessity. The story of Atlantis, the central part of Plato's trilogy, would have furnished another symbol of the struggle of Athena and Poseidon, or Zeus and Fate, order and primordial chaos, justice and lawless desires. Earthquakes and flood overwhelmed the fighters. Finally the 129 Cf.

"Zeus and Fate are reconciled." The dread, reminiscent of the primordial night, is preserved. Athena, in the Eumenides, bids her people "not to banish terror utterly" (Kal y J rb avbv raY 7rb6Xews  w aXekv).38 The foundation of the Areopagus, the dispenser of beneficial terror, marked for Aeschylus Athens' rise to a civilized existence. For Plato, the beginning of Athens' downfall dated from the overthrow of the Areopagus (461 B.c.). In the Laws (the dialogue which presumably has taken the place of the unwritten Hermocrates'39), he is eager to have the 'divine fear' cultivated among the citizens. It is true that the tragic conflict originates and develops in 'metaphysical darkness.' But it rises, in Aeschylus' trilogy, to a clarity and harmony which do away with the presuppositions of the original conflict. The new order emerging in the Eumenides admits a tragic antagonism as little as Plato's cosmos does. It is one thing to arrive at the reconciliation of Justice and Fate after a painful struggle-a result which is convincing only as result, that is, seen in conjunction with the suffering by which the recon- ciling wisdom must be earned-and another thing to conceive of the cosmic antagonism throughout in terms of a dialectical synthesis. A passage in the Laws concerning the universal strife may show how close the poet and the philosopher are to one another, but, at the same time, that their positions are still clearly distinct. There is, we read, "an immortal conflict going on among us, which re- quires marvellous watchfulness; and in that conflict the gods and demigods are our allies and we are their property. Injustice and insolence and folly are the destruction of us, and justice and wisdom and temperance are the salvation of us; and the place of these latter is in the life of the gods, and of their virtue some vestige may occa- sionally be discerned among mankind."'14 In Aeschylus we observe the gradual absorption of both the anthropomorphic gods and the demoniacal Fate into a just and divine order of things as a proc- 138 698; cf. 516-517. 139 Cornford, op. cit. 8; Laws 698b.
