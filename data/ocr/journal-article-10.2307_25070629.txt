<plain_text><page sequence="1">"NEHEMIAS AMERICANUS": COTTON MATHER AND THE CONCEPT OF THE REPRESENTATIVE AMERICAN* Sacvan Bercovitch COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY Because the acts and events of history have not that magnitude which satisfieth the mind of man, poesy feigneth acts and events greater and more heroical; because true history propoundeth the success and issues of actions not so agreeable to the merits of virtue and vice, therefore poesy feins them more ... according to revealed provi dence .... And therefore [poesy] was ever thought to have some participation of divine ness, because it doth raise . . . the mind, submitting the shews of things to the desires of the mind; whereas reason doth buckle and bow the mind unto the nature of things. Bacon, The Advancement of Learning Let me begin with a well-known paradox of American cultural his tory. Cotton Mather's Magnalia has been called the last work of its kind, a monumental hail and farewell to an already defunct social ideal. Yet the social vision which the Magnalia champions forms per haps the single most powerful imaginative current in our literature. I refer not only to the historiography of "redeemer nation," but to per sonal writing as well: to the procession of public autobiographies, through Thoreau and Whitman, which are really hagiographies of the world-redemptive American self, and to the panegyric form of post *This essay is based on the material in the third chapter of a book on the concept of the representative American (forthcoming, Yale University Press). My central text is Mather's biography of Winthrop in the Magnalia, entitled "Nehemias American us." (All references to the biography in this essay are from Magnalia Christi Americana, ed. Thomas Robbins, Hartford, I853-55, I, II8-31.) The first chapter, "Christology," deals with Winthrop's representative qualities as magistrate and saint, in terms of various theories and traditions of biography (Catholic, humanist, and Reformed). The second chapter, "Soteriology," deals with Winthrop as a representa tive Reformer in terms of the connections between hagiography and historiography, from the Reformation through the Puritan revolution. Later chapters examine chang ing rhetorical patterns in American Puritan writing, and changing modes of defining the American self, through the romantic period. The third chapter, "National Election," begins with a discussion of biography and historiography in other regions of the New World, and then traces the development of New England Puritan escha tology, with particular reference to the concept of representative American. What fol lows derives from material in the second part of chapter three.</page><page sequence="2">The Representative American 22I Puritan biography. Daniel Boorstin condemns the latter as a cross be tween the medieval Saint's Life and the Greek legends of the gods.1 George Bancroft conveys its purpose more precisely when he speaks of Washington's trials as "the dark, solemn ground on which the beauti ful work of his country's salvation was embroidered." Through the nineteenth century the Lives of public leaders constitute a kind of serial spiritual biography of America, a persistent effort to define "the type of man the new nation could produce," "the ideal American," "the true spirit of the nation." Jared Sparks in I834 urged a collection of the Lives of "great Americans" because it "would embrace a perfect his tory of the country." 2 For Emerson, Lincoln alone sufficed as "the true history of the American people." He did not mean by this to repeat Carlyle's view of the hero, even though he seconded Carlyle's dictum that history is the biography of great men. Carlyle was speaking in the tradition of the imitatio Christi: "Each man's life [is] a strange em blem of every man's"; "wherever there is a Man, a God also is re vealed, . . . a whole epitome of the Infinite." 3 Emerson, and the transcendentalists in general, combined that view with a futuristic and geographical ideal. The first duty of the American people, they de clared, was "to prove what the human race can be"; it had been de creed "The Fortune of the Republic" to produce "what the earth waits for,-exalted manhood." Accordingly, Emerson posited two types of "representative men," American and non-American. The latter he con ceived in static terms, either as embodying the imperfect cultures of the past or as indices to the atemporal "genius of humanity";4 the former, prophetic of the exalted manhood to come, he sketched most fully in "The American Scholar." He calls the essay "one more chapter" in a continuing "biogra phy"-in effect, a biography of the American self as scholar. It is also, of course, about the American as the primal One Man, as that secular antitype pervades German and English romantic literature, from Schiller's neo-pietist Aesthetic Education to Keats's belief that "A Man's life ... is a continual allegory, .. . like the scriptures figura tive." 5 What makes it uniquely American is the vision which Emer son imbibed through the culture from his New England forebears. Like Mather in the Life of Winthrop, and for a similar reason, he opens with a sweeping review of the past, from the ancient Greeks to the medieval Troubadours to "our contemporaries in the British and European capi tals." Then, following the westward course of history, he announces: Perhaps the time is already come when ... this continent will ... fill the postponed expectation of the world. Our day of dependence, our long apprenticeship draws to a close. The millions that around us are rushing into life, cannot always be fed on</page><page sequence="3">222 Early American Literature, VIII, I974 the sere remains of foreign harvests. Events, actions, arise, that must be sung, that will sing themselves. Who can doubt that poetry will revive and lead in a new age, as the star in the constellation Harp, which now flames in our zenith . . . shall one day be the pole-star for a thousand years? In this hope I accept the topic ... [of] the AMERICAN SCHOLAR.6 The distance between Emerson and Mather shows itself in certain revolutionary and romantic phrases: "day of dependence," poetry in place of theology, "rushing into life" as a quasi-naturalistic conversion experience, the constellation Harp rather than the millennial Sun of Righteousness. But these are new terms in an old context. The teleology is the same ("apprenticeship," "must . . . will sing themselves"), as is the rhetorical strategy, and its underlying eschatological assumption, that the American enterprise, unlike all others, interweaves personal and corporate self-fulfillment. As the scholar's telos comprehends the particular natures of all men, so the delegated national function trans cends the secular concept of nationhood by realizing the world's post poned expectation. It is true that Emerson equates this place, this time, with all times. But he does so in order to herald "the auspicious signs of the coming day" which "glimmer already through poetry and art, ... through church and state." So, too, he calls the roll of European genius -Goethe, Wordsworth, Swedenborg-as preface to his plea for a greater New World literature: "We have listened too long to the courtly muses of Europe." If he castigates the country for its base "materialities," he more largely eulogizes the advantages of demo cracy, advantages which make the American political system not simply different from but superior to all others, because, like Lincoln, it is "representative of this continent." And when he declares that "the world is nothing, the man is all," it is only to reaffirm that "the un searched might of man belongs, by all motives, by all prophecy, by all preparation, to the American Scholar." Rising from "hope" to "confi dence," he declares, summarily, that a "nation of men will for the first time exist," in America.7 Emerson's outlook is significant in the broadest terms: he is clearly the crucial figure in the continuity of our culture from the Puritan through the Romantic periods. For the present purpose, however, I wish not so much to argue the similarities between "The American Scholar" and "Nehemias Americanus," as to recall a tradition which in its many forms, fictional and non-fictional, leads back to colonial Puritanism. I mean the association of christic and federal identity which distinguishes early New England writing, and in particular the unique rhetorical strategy by which Mather, in his Life of Winthrop'(and other bio graphies), makes the term "America" a symbol of the fusion of chris</page><page sequence="4">The Representative American 223 tology and soteriology, the epic of the soul and the corporate journey in to the New World. Mather's strategy is profoundly expressive of the emigrants' con cept of themselves. Nonseparatists though they were, they differed from the advocates of the elect nation in two vital respects. The more readily apparent of these is theological. As congregationalists on a historic errand, the emigrants tended to conflate the theories of state and church, the communal covenant with the covenant of grace. The English Puritans also applied the same covenantal phrases to the be liever and the nation. But they did so assuming the distinction between saint and citizen. Substantively, they knew, the Israelites' federal cov enant concerned the story of the City of Man-it pertained to them ex ternally, as "similitude and resemblance" 8-whereas considered as figura the Israelite covenant pertained only to those under the covenant of grace. The Bay theocrats sometimes repeated the distinction. But by and large they did so assuming that what they called their "New Na tional Covenant" effectually closed the gap between federal and private calling. As visible saints "clad in the mantle of national election," 9 they laid claim, for themselves alone, to the status of the biblical Israel, where to be a believer was ipso facto to have a social identity, and where, conversely, to be a member in good standing of the society, a "true Israelite," was ipso facto to be one of God's chosen people. And with their claim came a series of peculiar prerogatives. Merging parallel and figura, the clergy announced that they were in fact an army of saints-"actually, personally, and professedly" blessed in Christ "both in this and in another world." God had engaged himself "by all his Promises, to pardon us" and to lead us toward New Jerusalem.10 Here, as nowhere else, he was carrying "on his invisible work ... by the outward means of Grace ... [in] a Visible Sion." Here public service signified redemption, after the manner of "our Nehemiah." "Here when God chastens he aims to profit." Here, election is virtually hereditary, passing "through the loyns of godly parents" from father to son. Here only, "When God moves the Wheels of Providence ... He is wont at [the same] . .. time to move the Wheels of Grace. 11 Anne Hutchinson objected that this was to distort the nature of the saint's union with Christ. Roger Williams denounced it on the grounds that it violated the cardinal distinction between Israel and all other communities. It was true, Williams conceded, that the colonists' feder al covenant placed them in a special relationship with God; but the re lationship was strictly a matter of providence: although it might bring larger harvests, it held no significance for either the history of redemp tion or the believer's journey to God. Figurally understood, Israel was</page><page sequence="5">224 Early American Literature, VIII, I974 "A Non-such and an unparalel'd Figure of the Spiritual State, " whereas "America," he insisted, "(as Europe and all nations) lies dead in sin." 12 But Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson were not really American Puritans. Those who were knew their unparalleled rights. They proceed ed accordingly to pronounce their social covenant a fusion of heaven and earth. As the Cambridge Platform put it, we are "a company of Saints by calling, united into one body"-federal and christic-possessed of "the Priviledges of the Kingdom" and, indeed, "already Initiating ourselves at the Works of that Kingdom." "You do commit the safety of this cause to the Lord himself " the orthodoxy reiterated, "in the same way that you do commit unto him the Salvation of your own soules." 13 Thus they welded together the traditional Protestant dualities, as did no other community, into a single, cohesive force. On the one hand, the theocracy blended Lutheran piety and Calvinist insti tutionalism; on the other hand, it combined Luther's "teleological eschatology," directed toward the apocalyptic Son of Man, and Calvin's "realized eschatology," centered exclusively upon the crucified Jesus. So conceived, the New England Way marks the high-point of the evolu tion of the theory of national election. Luther had spoken of a fleeting opportunity, one which would pass quickly to other countries if the Germans did not seize it at once and hold fast. "Gather in," he pleaded, "while it still shines." 14 The Marian exiles had supplemented the appeal by their more fully articulated nationalism and by their Calvin istic stress upon discipline. The New World orthodoxy changed the perspective from antiquarian to prophetic history, enlarged the belief in godly rule to mean the reign of the saints, and redefined the sense of op portunity-"New-England's design in this vast undertaking" 15-as God's long-promised summons to his people, as irreversible as it was irresistible, to "create a new Heaven, and a new Earth ... [in] the end of the World." "GOD intended to write upon these Churches the Name of New Jerusalem." His "Name . . . hath been written upon us in Capital Letters from the beginning" of time.16 Their argument drew strength from the second "peculiar" aspect of their cause: its unique locale. Even granted the harmony of saint and society, after all, Roger Williams might have been right; to all appear ances, the barren American strand was just another plot of ground in a fallen world. The essence of early New England historiography lay in the conviction that it was not. "Europe and all nations" had a double affiliation. In a primal, absolutist sense they belonged to God, but inso far as they were "dead in sin"-that is, temporally, legally, and provi dentially-they belonged to separate federal constituencies. The New World, like Canaan of old, belonged wholly to God. The remnant that</page><page sequence="6">The Representative American 225 fled Babylon in I630 set sail for the new promised land, especially re served by God from eternity for his new Israel. Why else did he so long conceal it, but to make its discovery the finale to his work of redemp tion? Did mere chance explain the fact that its discovery coincided with the two greatest human achievements since Christ, the Reforma tion and the development of the printing-press, which gave the world ac cess to the Bible? Was it by accident that heaven inspired Columbus to call the New World "St. SAVIOUR"? Did not even European divines acknowledge that this last continent to sound the trumpet of the Gospel was the world's "fourth corner"? (and did not the best of them ac cordingly, "talke of New-England with delight," perceiving as they did in its "national-as well as congregational-pattern of virtue ... a true type of heaven itself'?).17 Was it not by design that the Book of Revelation found its greatest interpreters just before the voyage of the Arbella? Was not God's will manifest in the pestilence that cleared the land of Indians just before the fleet landed? In the face of such evidence, surely no one could believe that the American past, like that of Britain and Germany, lay in the realm of providential history, to be investigated by impartial antiquarians. Luther and Foxe had each hoped to confirm his country's election by setting straight its chronicles. Tudor and Stuart patriots undertook to display "the glory of the British original" 18 by providing a historical background as ancient as Rome. John Leland and William Camden defended the historicity of King Arthur in the hope that England's splen dor "would revive when another native king regained the throne"; later, the author of Eikonoklastes planned to rouse his "noble and puissant Nation" 19 with an epic of Arthur's mighty deeds. But could any true believer derive America's meaning (any more than he could Canaan's) from heathen legends and chronicles? Could he find in Indian records the country's "divine Originall and Native beautie"? there, the fact that America was intended as "the highest step ... to wards Reformation"? there, the story of its saving remnant, to whom God gave "these Ends of the Earth ... for the Bounds of their Habita tion, " showing "more Love and Zeal ... for them, then for any other people in the World"? 20 Unmistakably, the New World was part of the history of salvation. Hence the clergy's insistence that its past was postdated and its future antedated in prophecy. Hence Mather's description of the transatlantic crossing (at the start of the Magnalia) as the voyage of the ark of Christ, changing geography into "Christiano-graphy. "21 As for the Indians, the settlers wavered in their opinion: they might be either the lost tribes of Israel or the spawn of Satan. The debate centered on the prophecies</page><page sequence="7">226 Early American Literature, VIII, I974 about the Conversion of the Jews vis-a-vis God's promise that his rem nant would conquer the ends of the earth and have the heathen for their inheritance (Ps. 2:8). In either case, the significance of America re mained firmly rooted in eschatology. One way or another, that is, country, saint, and church reflected one another, coma ira da iri, in the definition of the colony. Each of the three identities was fundamental to the whole, but what most clearly radiated the special nature of the undertaking, its somma luce, was its christianographical locale. Saint hood and church-membership implied one another; the idea of America implied both in the proper apocalyptic context, justified the doctrines of nonseparation and of theocracy, explained the meaning of America's "discovery," expressed the relationship of England to New England, con soled the settlers in their difficulties, and assured them of success. Christic selfhood was a tremendous barrier against the terrors of self discovery, but, as the English saints were to discover, it left the indivi dual prey to the mutability of providence. The American Puritan self was a garden enclosed from the threat even of secular failure. It was precisely the enormity of that threat, I am suggesting, which prompted the emigrants to formulate their concept of themselves. The English Calvinist may have trembled at the uncertainty of his election, but he knew, proudly, that he was an Englishman. So did the emigrant, but not proudly; he fled England as Bunyan's Pilgrim fled the City of Destruction. It seemed to him "literally Babel, and so consequently AEgypt and Sodome"-a country "grown fat for the slaughter," im minently to be "abased and brought down to hell." 22 "All the other Churches of Europe are brought to desolation," wrote Winthrop before his departure, "and it cannot be but a like judgment is coming upon us"; America is "to be a refuge" for those whom God "means to save out of this generall callamitie. " 23 The New Englander, then, had the fail ure of European Protestantism behind him, and before him, as his "re fuge," what he called "wilderness" and "desert." The terms speak for themselves of his fear; the adjectives with which he formulaicly sur rounded them are more explicit still: "howling," "hideous," "Satanic," "wild." Cut off from family and friends by "soe vast an Ocean," spiritually divorced from the Church of England and physically from England's comforts and culture, working a "strange land" which he had by patent from an unsympathetic English king and which (Roger Williams reminded him) rightfully belonged to the native "savages" -who was he? Granted that his true home was heaven, he still needed a federal identity. Purists, enthusiasts like Williams and Hutchinson felt indifferent about such matters. But the nonseparating emigrant considered his social commitment crucial to his selfhood as Christian:</page><page sequence="8">The Representative American 227 that commitment made visible his sainthood, his allegiance to the Re formation, and his historic destiny. Under these circumstances, he could hardly see himself merely as a pilgrim seeking salvation, or as an exile awaiting return, like the Marian expatriates. He had to justify himself by justifying America. His solution, which combined and transcended the meanings of pilgrim and exile, was as sweeping as it was simple. He had discovered his personal identity as Puritan by recourse to christology; now he over came the problem of his American identity by recourse to soteriology: by interpreting his everyday experiences in the light of the Second Com ing, and by imposing upon the communal effort the image of the Messiah's advancing millennial army. The relationship between psychic uncertainty and rhetorical self-assertion is transparent in the tone of crisis that characterizes much of the literature. With every setback, the assertion of American selfhood rises to a higher pitch. It is no accident that the myth of the founding fathers develops with the failure of the Protectorate, or that apocalypticism reaches its height first with King Philip's war and then with the Andros regime. The underlying inse curity is most pronounced in the most impassioned national self-affirma tions. I quote from Joshua Scottow's defense of the errand, written soon after the loss of the original colonial charter and the rise of Stoddard ism: That this Design was Super-humane, will be evidenced by the Primum Mobile, or grand Wheel thereof. Neither Spanish Gold or Silver, nor French or Dutch Trade of Peltry did oil their Wheels.... The Setting up of Christ's Kingdom ... was the main spring of motion, and that which gave the Name to New-England, and at such a time, when as Divine Herbert in his Temple Prophetically sang Religion Stands on Tiptoe in our Land, Ready to pass to the AMERICAN Strand. The agency of the great God appeared, who ... raised up such as were fit to lead, and feed this People in this wilderness; ... we had our Mose's, and Aaron's, our Zorababels, and Joshua's, our Ezrah's, and Nehemiah's.... Men of narrow spirits, of mean capacities and fortunes, had not been capable to officiate in so great a worke. That such, and so many Gentlemen of Ancient and Worshipful Families, ... should Combine ... in so desperate and dangerous a De sign, attended with such insuperable Difficulties, and Hazards, in the plucking up of their Stakes, leaving so pleasant and profitable a place as their Native Soil, part ing with their Patrimonies, Inheritances, plentiful Estates, and settlement of Houses well Furnished; of Land well Stock'd, and with comfortable ways of Subsistence, which the first Planters Deserted; and not a few did leave all their worldly hopes, to come into this Desert, &amp; unknown Land, and smoaky Cottages, to the Society of Cursed Cannibals, (as they have proved to be) and at best wild Indians; what less then a Divine Ardour could inflame a People thus circumstanced to a work so con trary to Flesh and Blood.</page><page sequence="9">228 Early American Literature, VIII, I974 Infinite Wisdom ... directed this.... Divine Courage and Resolution man aged it, Super-humane Sedulity and Diligence attended it, and Angelical Swiftness and Dispatch finished it,... according to... predeterminate Design.24 Significantly, the lines cited from Herbert's poem take on just the opposite meaning from that which Herbert intended. The rhetoric of the entire passage is a defense against the prospect, which the poem sug gests, that the settlement at Massachusetts Bay is no more than another imperfect human undertaking: Yet as the Church shall thither westward flie, So Sinne shall trace and dog her instantly: They have their period also and set times Both for their vertuous actions and their crimes. * * * * Thus also Sinne and Darknesse follow still The Church and Sunne with all their power and skill.25 Scottow's capitalized and italicized "AMERICAN" stands as a barrier, raised' by the myth-making imagination upon self-doubt, against poetic or providential irony. We might recall in this connection the cloud-capp'd walls of the American Jerusalem, which Mather con jures up to vindicate the trials of John Winthrop, "chosen for the Moses who must be the leader of so great an undertaking," since "nothing but a Mosaic spirit could have carried ... a gentleman of his education ... [and] fair estate" to America. In both cases, the anxiety about the power of "Sinne and Darknesse," and about "a work so contrary to Flesh and Blood," is brought under control by the assertion of the predeterminate national design. Paradoxically, that is, the image of America provides the ultimate guarantee that things are not really what they are in fact. Like Scottow, Mather solves the prob lem of federal identity by raising the locale in toto-past, present, and future-into the realm of redemptive history. The American Puritan elaborated upon this solution from one generation to the next with all the energy of one who must defend his selfhood not only in the face of a harsh environment, but against com mon sense and the opinion of the world. Was he an exile? America became for him "the land of Vision," like the Isle of Patmos. Did Satan rule the country and its heathen inhabitants? The Puritan errand was an emblem of Christ's hastening deliverance of mankind. Were the colonists cultivating a "rocky, bushy, thorny" soil in the world's remote corners? Scripture foretold that the chosen remnant would make the desert blossom like the rose, and gather the harvest from the ends of the earth. Were they separated from their brethren, often scorned by them for their flight into "the outer darkness"? It was</page><page sequence="10">The Representative American 229 ever God's way to bring light out of darkness; he had selected the new continent for just that purpose, to radiate back across the Atlantic a model of Christian charity. Did they find themselves besieged by Indians, plagued by schism and natural disaster? God was especially severe with his servants; he showed his love by scourging them with his corrective providential lash. Job's reward, the ministry never tired of insisting, forecast "the End of the Lord with New-England":26 "His called and Faithful, and Chosen shall more than overcome at last";27 in the colony's agon lay "a sure Prognostick that happy times are at hand, even at the Doors." 28 Their consolation sounds through the seventeenth century; and always, with a rising fervor (and desperation), it affirms the daring personal-national eschatology by which the orthodoxy shaped the New World in the image of their errand. Their use of Job in this respect marks a dominant theme in the literature after mid-century.29 It was reinforced by many similar figurae: Joseph, Samson, Jacob, David, and above all Nehemiah, who led the Israelites out of Babylon to Jerusalem, as a type of the Messiah of the Second Coming. In its every aspect their strategy pointed toward the same astounding purpose no less astounding for the fact that it followed from the logic of their rhetoric. Having raised the country into the realm of sacred history, they proceeded one step further and imposed upon it the norms of spiritual biography. As the saint typed forth the entire church of the elect, so conversely America was seen to reflect the calling and tempta tions of each of its elect settlers. It was itself the exile redeemed from captivity, itself the saint sloughing off the influence of the Old Adam, exhibiting the good works which signalled its glorification, awaken ing after a long slothful sleep into the light of grace, assuming at last its true identity, and therefore engaged in a "fatal enterprize against all the devils and damned"-since "when the Devil sees that we shall shortly be where the wicked cease from troubling, [then] that wicked one will trouble us more than ever before." As John the Divine had predicted (Rev. 12:12), the tempter's "wrath grew great as the time to exert it grew short." In the Life of Winthrop, Mather applies this prophecy of Arma geddon to his hero's final "conflict," directly before "he enjoyed in his holy soul the great consolations of God." Such internalization of apocalyptic imagery is consistent with Reformed practice. What is re markable-and distinctive in Mather's biographical technique-is that he means us to apply the prophecy also to America's soul (or character, or destiny). This assumption underlies the epitaph that closes the Life of Winthrop, the rhetorical leap from Winthrop's glorifi</page><page sequence="11">230 Early American Literature, VIII, I974 cation to Winthrop-Nehemiah's quintessential achievement, his role in the construction of the "Novanglorum moenia." This vision of America explains Mather's application of the same text to the Salem trials (which he recounts toward the end of the Magnalia) as though that episode were part of the New World's climactic temptation. His friend Samuel Sewall, noting how "wonderfully suited" was "the going of Christ into America" in these latter days, speaks of New Jerusalem as "the Heart of America," and of "America's plea" for the Second Coming as "the strongest" now being raised to God. Be fore the migration, the continent was like Rachel, "desolate and un married"; now "she may receive Jesus Christ as Her Husband . . . and her Children [like Rachel's] shall be more and mightier than her Sisters." So, too, Mather declares that America stands at last revealed as the first among Christ's beloved, pulcherrimaa inter mulieres," the most beautiful of his brides. Adapting the Song of Songs for the occa sion, he cries: "Awake, Awake ... and put on thy Beautiful Garments, O American Jerusalem." And to her children, the "New-English Israel," he brings the glad tidings that The Devil was never more let Loose than in our Days; and it proves the Thousand Years is not very Far off. SHORTLY didst thou say, Dearest Lord! O Gladsome word! ... [Considering our tribulations,] I may Sigh over this Wilderness as Moses did over his, We are consumed by thine Anger ... [Yet] if God have a purpose to make here a Seat for any of Those Glorious Things, which are spoken of Thee, 0 Thou City of God; then even thou, O New-England art within a very little while of Better Dayes than have ever yet Dawn'd upon thee. Our Lord Jesus Christ shall have the uttermost parts of the Earth for his Possession, the last [shall] be the first, and the Sun of Righteousness come to shine Brightest, in Climates which it rose Latest upon! 30 So considered, the idea of national election takes on a literalness undreamed of by Luther or Foxe. It is the kind of literalness, in fact, assumed by the colonists about themselves. For the Anglican settlers of the South, America meant the opportunity to live as Englishmen in the comforts of another Eden; for the Spanish Franciscans it meant the opportunity as Christian missionaries to organize the natives into a "millennial kingdom." 31 The New England Puritans gave America the status of visible sainthood. The subsequent impact of their con cept cannot be overestimated; whatever the extent of its influence, it contributes to the difference in cultural development between the differ ent areas of the New World, to the usurpation of "American" identity by the United States, and to the anthropomorphic nationalism that permeates our literature-not the secular anthropomorphism of parent hood ("Mother Russia," "British homeland," "German fatherland"), but the eschatological anthropomorphism of spiritual biography:</page><page sequence="12">The Representative American 23I "American Dream," "manifest destiny," and, fundamentally, "the American self" as metaphor for universal rebirth. Mather uses this concept to fuse New England's Jerusalem and the City of God in his Theopolis Americana. He uses it in the Magnalia's narrative sections to describe the Great Migration as the historical correlative to the "Divine Call" experienced by each of its representative "first-fathers." And he uses this concept, biographically, to celebrate John Winthrop as pater patriae, one of the "glories of America," a hero worthy to have his portrait "hung up with honor in the state-house of his coun try," "most zealous for the glory of his countrymen," the American Nehemiah. The scope of Mather's concept of Winthrop as representative American is suggested by his father's preface to Johannes in Eremo,32 a group of five Lives of New England divines, incorporated into Book III of the Magnalia. Speaking of biography in general, Increase Mather notes that the Bible's "exemplary lives" have a predominantly "historical" purpose. They praise "such as had been choice instru ments ... to promote [God's] glory in the world." Accordingly, he points out that in these Lives the organizing referent is not John the Baptist. It is "Eremo," the New World landscape, scene of the "mighty deeds of Christ" in this closing act of sacred history. Or rather, it is the title as a whole, "Johns in the wilderness," illuminated by the idea of America. As he explains it, the Baptist serves as a christological analogue for the sainthood of each of the divines; his relationship to New England is soteriological (a progression of wilderness errands); what links the two functions is God's plan "to build Jerusalem" in "these dark corners of the earth." The texts he alludes to, from Daniel and Revelation, refer the reader to the end-time "Messiah the Prince," as he revealed himself to his exiles: Moses wandering in the Arabian deserts, Nehemiah in the "dark corners" of Babylon, and John the Divine, "carried away into the wilderness" as John Cotton wrote, in prefacing a defense of the New England Way, "that he might see more clearly ... the coming down from heaven of... the New Jerusalem." 33 What Increase intends through these associations, as did his father-in law, is to direct us to the most recent and radiant of these revelations. He makes this clear by reference to the famous election-day sermon of 1667, Nehemiah Upon the Wall in Troublesome Times, Jonathan Mitchel's prothalamium for "the Spouse of Christ" in new-born America, where 'Jerusalem, both City and Wall should be built again, " according to prophecy and promise: Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to [Nehemiah] ... to build Jerusalem, unto the Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks,</page><page sequence="13">232 Early American Literature, VIII, 1974 and threescore and two weeks; the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. (Daniel 9:25) * * * And I John saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heav en saying, Behold ... [God] will dwell with them, and they shall be his people.... And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes ... [as he did from Rachel's, and] make all things new. (Rev. 21:2-5) This is also Mather's meaning in every one of the five Lives. In this sense he calls Moses and Foxe his predecessors and proclaims his achievement not The Acts and Monuments of the Church with special national significance, but the Magnalia Christi Americana, one of whose subjects (compressed into Book V) is the "Acts and Monuments of the Church." This is the method, finally, by which he portrays John Winthrop. The rhetorical directions of "Nehemias" and "Americanus" converge because the terms come not only to equal but to define each other; Nehemiah's role in sacred history by way of America, America's holy commonwealth by way of Nehemiah. Together they embody the meaning of the errand. The colony at large is the American Nehemiah of the Reformation, as the Reformation is the Nehemiah of the uni versal church, and as America is the Nehemiah among the nations of the world. And of all this John Winthrop is representative. The source of his heroism is internal; its substance lies in the myth of the New World enterprise, much as the hero of Leaves of Grass realizes himself by demonstrating that "the United States are themselves the greatest poem. To speak of Winthrop's stature as "mythical"-and to com pare it in this respect with Whitman's aesthetic-is not to blur but, I believe, to accent its distinctiveness. We are told that the mythical "super-individual" helps establish social equilibrium by providing a model through which every member of the community may fulfill his life, may "discover himself enhanced, enriched, supported, and magni fied" by the image, potential yet necessarily inhibited, within himself." 34 Certainly this applies to Mather's portrait. But just as certainly it ap plies to his view of America, microcosm of the world-wide work of re demption and macrocosm of the redemptive work underway in the soul of each of its chosen people. One aspect reinforces the other in the Life of Winthrop through the mutually sustaining ramifications of "Nehe mias" and "Americanus." Or again, we read that "primitive" rituals reconcile the displaced individual with himself and the cosmos by reenacting the primal dramas of the tribe's "fathers"; thus "biography ... is transformed en bloc to a form of history of a higher power than itself." 35 Some such motive informs Mather's work. Only his hero</page><page sequence="14">The Representative American 233 is also the tribe as a whole, so that history is transformed in turn to a still "higher power" of spiritual biography. And in this context, further more, the drama is seen as an ongoing enterprise, a ritual which unites present, past, and future, and yet remains still to be completed. To iden tify with Winthrop is not merely to assume the characteristics of an action finished and justified. It is this, too, but more largely it is to be come part of a teleology, to take on a federal selfhood that is at once evolving and predetermined, manifest yet only partially realized. In the language Mather would prefer, it is to assume an identity which, without losing its christic import, conforms to the figura of America be cause it vindicates the course of redemptive history. In sum, Winthrop's meaning as "Nehemias Americanus" is that he foreshadows, in Americans to come, his own full representativeness, as the walls of New England foreshadow the "Theopolis Americana," and as Nehemiah then signifies Nehemiah now, insofar as he points to the Redeemer who will build the City of God in New Canaan and make all things new. It seems inevitable in retrospect that it should be the concept of America that distinguishes the Puritan myth. More than any other as pect of their thought, the settlers' understanding of themselves as Americans made sense of their experience as Puritans and as New Eng landers. The process has something of the circular logic of all compen satory mythical self-projections. It begins by raising an imaginative de fense against what seems a formidable external threat, and ends by using that defense as evidence that the threat does not "really" exist, despite "appearances." But again a distinction must be made. For English Puritans, the process took shape in the rhetoric of self-justification. The concept of divine selfhood they formulated survived the failure of Puritanism because, as myth, it could be appropriated for different ends-those, for example, of Coleridge and Carlyle. The New England Puritans, who had a double threat to deal with, extended the rhetoric of self-justification to the myth of a national selfhood. According to their circular logic, the country's christic image certified the theocracy's role in redemptive history and this in turn was confirmed by the composite figure of the "true" American. In effect, they provided a mode of spiritual biography which could survive not only the failure of Puritan ism but the subsequent re-vision of New England as the United States. Mather's biographies seem pathetic if they are read as an effort to re store the old order. He himself had no such illusion. His well-known statement of purpose, "whether New-England live any where else or no, it must live in this History," equates history with biography, with New England, and with an act of faith. Time has vindicated his faith, I be</page><page sequence="15">234 Early American Literature, VIII, I974 lieve, but not because of the persistence of Puritan historiography, or the flowering of New England, or the exemplary qualities of his heroes. He succeeded because he managed to fuse all of these in the myth of America. In a sense, Mather's success was accidental. One reason for it lies in developments which fostered the need for the Puritan vision, or its secular equivalent. I mean above all the recurrent crises of national identity; the uneasy cultural relations with Europe, where the distinc tion between the Old World and the New compensated for the felt in adequacy of artistic tradition; the successive migrations, which used the idea of a supra-ethnic, futuristic "American" selfhood to forge a na tionality ex nihilo; the westward expansion across Indian territory, where the concept of manifest destiny effectually settled the question of rights of ownership to the land; the disparities among economic, pa triotic, and religious interests in the nineteenth century, where again the national teleology served as mediator, to bridge spiritual progress and "social Darwinism," Gospel and Wealth. The list could easily be expanded. It should not exclude as too obvious the coincidence that America actually turned out to be a land flowing with milk and honey, and, if we consider democratic capitalism the best of all possible politi cal systems, then also the light of the world. Another reason for Mather's success, and one directly pertinent to the Magnalia itself (rather than to New England Puritanism in general) lies in the value of American identity for the alienated figures who comprise our literary tradition. It served them in much the same compensatory way it did the latter-day orthodoxy, to assuage their sense of isolation, and to fortify them against an indifferent or hostile society. How well it served may be gauged by the Pisgah view of Whitman's Democratic Vistas, rising from the wilderness below to the promise beyond; by Hester Prynne, the sin-stained prefiguration of the "prophetess" to come, when the country will have fulfilled its "high and glorious destiny"; by Thoreau at Walden, self-professed exile, rebel, individualist, and exemplar of the "only true America." For the major figures of the American Renaissance, as for Cotton Mather, the way out of private despair is the affirmation of a national selfhood which allows the individual to create himself in the image of America even as he spiritualizes America into a metaphor for the journey of the soul. In the Life of Winthrop, unlike (say) Walden and Democratic Vistas, the process is biographical; but the very terms of that process, we have seen, make interchangeable the modes of biography and auto biography: both find their model in the norms of American identity.</page><page sequence="16">The Representative American 235 This convertibility of the two genres provides a clue, I think, to the major reason for Mather's success. He inherited a form of rhetoric designed to sustain the community against the worst eventualities of providence; writing at a time when those eventualities had become fact, he was able to realize the full potential of the rhetoric: to internalize the errand, and declare himself the meaning of America. It is beyond the scope of this essay to detail the process by which Mather manages this gargantuan feat of the imagination. Let it suffice to note that his diaries portray him in the dual guise of John the Baptist and Christ, herald of the new day and touchstone to the country's once and future glory, and that his biographies reinforce the portrait by objectifying it in a processionof ideal Americans: Francis Higginson, "Janus Nov Anglicanus"; Charles Chauncy, "Cadmus Americanus"; John Eliot, "The Triumph of Reformed Religion in America"; Thomas Hooker, "The Light of the Western Churches"; Jonathan Mitchel, "Puritan ismus Nov-Anglicanus." Directly or indirectly, all of them attest to the public leadership which ought to have been Mather's; each of them stands for the New World teleology which Mather embodies, in spite of (or beyond) the perverse direction of history. This holds true as well for the Life of Winthrop. The same rhetorical strategy which makes it a chapter in the spiritual biography of America, also makes it, to some extent at least, part of the author's spiritual autobiography. Surely, Mather is thinking of himself when he decries the local Tobijahs and Sanballats who vexed "our New England Nehemiah," when he commiserates with Winthrop's Job-like trials, as terrible as they were un deserved, and when he speaks of Winthrop's legacy as being America's rising greatness, rendering his hero's glorification in effect a preview of the corporate future. In this light, the transparent wish-fulfillment of the closing scene-Winthrop-Nehemiah-Jacob surrounded by his "children," the patriarch of the American Jerusalem addressing the tribes of the New Israel-is properly balanced by the biography's opening quotation: "Whatever winds may blow, our art shall never pass away. For it is to art that Mather's biography belongs. I do not mean by this to make undue aesthetic claims for the Life of Winthrop. Mather often likens himself to an artist, and conceived of the Magnalia as an epic, but he was quick to admit his shortcomings. I refer rather to the enormous imaginative intensity which expressed itself in quantity if not quality (some four hundred and fifty published works besides the Magnalia), and especially to the nature of his imagination, its capa city to transmute his outdated beliefs into a celebration simultaneously of the nation, of its exemplary heroes, and of himself, one which stands</page><page sequence="17">236 Early American Literature, VIII, I974 impervious to what he archly calls the "plain facts" because it has al ready transferred these into the realm of vision. Here too, time and chance have helped Mather. As it turns out, his stance resembles that of a long line of American Jeremiahs. Still, what he achieved is re markable in its own right. His Life of Winthrop merits our attention not for the greater works it foreshadows, but for the biographical method it sets forth, and the heroic concept it establishes, a concept larger than the disparate seventeenth-century elements it contains, be cause it defines the representative American.
