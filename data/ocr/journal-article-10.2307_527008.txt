Editions de la Maison des Sciences de l'Homme, Paris, 1993. Pp. 307, figs 124. Price: Fr 350. ISBN 2 7351 0496 6. This book is a remarkable achievement. It represents the combined efforts of some fifty-five scholars who have collected together fairly comprehensive information on the distribution of all types of Gallo-Roman terracotta figurines. Almost all of modern France is covered, and there is treatment of the finds from Belgium, Britain, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, and Switzerland, as well as from the provinces of Raetia and Noricum. It cannot be classed as a definitive corpus, but it goes a very long way towards building up a profile of the output and distributions of the principal workshops, and so builds nicely on the earlier work of one of the editors, Micheline Rouvier-Jeanlin, who has already done so much in this field. After listing the evidence for terracotta production from the various workshops known in Gaul (of which the Allier group appears the most important), there is a chapter on manufacturing techniques, dating, repertoire, the Iron Age background to the phenomenon, and the context of the finds. Mass production is a distinct feature of the Roman period, and finds are fairly evenly distributed between settlements, sanctuaries, and cemeteries, but the extent to which these figurines served as votives or as part of any religious observance is unclear. There are, however, important differences in the way different types of figurines are deposited: wild animals are associated more with burials, domestic animals more with sanctuaries, while divinities and other anthropomorphic representations occur in settlement contexts. The distributional survey takes two chapters, one for French finds, the second for the remainder. Finds are quantified and plotted by groups of departements, and a separate map is provided to show the incidence of the commonest types of Venus and Mother Goddess figurines. Each study area has its own commentary. Although no overall maps are provided, it is relatively easy to get a feel for distributions as a whole, with particular concentrations in Central Gaul (as might be expected), the south coast of Brittany, and northwards into the northern parts of Gallia Belgica. British finds (westwards to Nornour on Scilly, and northwards to Skye) are numerous, but there is no quantification. The relatively steep fall off in finds to the south and south-west of the main production centres is remarkable, with few examples from Aquitaine and Narbonensis. Nor, in general, are figurines frequent finds in Noricum and Raetia (although a total of about 16o were recovered from a cemetery at Salzburg). The most easterly recorded figurine is from Aquincum. One suspects that there is a close correlation with the distribution of Central Gaulish sigillata, although this has yet to be demonstrated. Given that there is a fairly even spread of the commoner types, one suspects that marketing was probably supply-led, with little opportunity for regional preferences to be expressed and passed back to manufacturers. The final chapter is concerned with chemical analysis of the fabrics and a methodology for the computer classification of individual figurines. The notable achievement is the way so many individuals collaborated to bring about this survey, which has succeded in placing the ever-growing number of regionalised, definitive catalogues in a wider context. Here surely is a model for comparable surveys to be carried out in Roman Britain. University of Reading MICHAEL FULFORD</page></plain_text>
