<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Essay on a New Philosophy of Nature. By Gaston Renou. Ex- position Press: New York, 1975. 90 pages. $ 5.00. BOOKS IN REVIEW Renou has proved himself in this little work to be an articulate spokesman for the earth. He has carried the battle for a sound ecological approach by man towards his home planet to the camp of Christian theology which he blames for foisting on man a self-defeating understanding of his relationship with the earth. He cites numerous authoritative passages to bolster his unex- ceptional claim that "our philosophy of nature conditions our treatment of nature..." (p.xii). In this first chapter he establishes the Christian view of man and nature. In Chapter Two he argues that this view, based on an at- tempt to combine an anthropomorphic way (e.g., "God is love") and a metaphysical way (e.g., "God is infinite") of talking about God, is theoreti- cally impossible. For the anthropomorphic way presupposes that God is a physical being in space and time, whereas the metaphysical way presupposes that God is a transcendent being who cannot be in space and time. When the basis for the Christian view of nature is removed, the view itself must fall. In Chapter Three, the claim is defended that a new ethics is required con- cerning the relation of man to nature. Standing in the way of such an en- vironmental ethics, however, is the fact that we accord moral rights only to persons. Further, morality presupposes freedom as a necessary condition. Since there is no possibility of freedom in nature, an environmental ethics would appear to be impossible in principle. Renou suggests that there exists a world view in which the logical gap between nature and freedom is removed, that of the North American Indian. In Chapter Four, Renou considers attempts by Christian writers to appreciate the natural world: that of St. Augustine, that nature is good because the work of God; the view that man is a steward of nature, not conqueror and over- lord: an appeal to the words of Christ in the Sermon on the Mount when he abjured us to "consider the lillies of the field... ." Finally, he discusses the ar- guments of F. A. Schaeffer in his Pollution and the Death of Man - The Christian View of Ecology. Renou argues that all of these attempts must ultimately fail because of the metaphysical dualism of Christianity. In Chapter Eight, Renou introduces the rival world view of Organic Monism and discusses its root metaphor, that of the Mother, together with its categories. As a result of this discussion, he defends the thesis that nature is not for man. Renou's thoughtful analysis and critique, it seems to the present writer, is deserving of any equally thoughtful consideration by those whose lives are dedicated to a perpetual encounter with, and interpretation of, God's will for man.
