<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE: REVISITING THE QUESTION OF CONSIDERATION Roy Kreitner* What are the stakes in distinguishing between gifts and contracts, be- tween gratuitous undertakings and those supported by consideration? This Article addresses the effects of the distinction by comparing early debates over the doctrine of consideration with recent debates over the law of gifts. Late nineteenth-century legal scholars revolutionized the doctrine of consideration, unifying diverse doctrines around the single question of the enforceability of promises. But while the revolution in consideration doctrine succeeded in generating widely agreed upon rules, a detailed examination of case law surrounding gift promises shows that the rules could not ensure predictable outcomes even in what should have been easy cases. Twentieth-century changes in the rules and theirjustifications left the framework for discussion intact, and have not challenged the conception of contract as centered on promissory liability. This Article argues that placing the question of consid- eration at the heart of contract theory is the technical manifestation of a conceptualization of contract around promise, rather than around more dif- fuse ideas of obligation. By placing promise at the center of contractual obli- gation, consideration theory advances a conception of contracting individu- als as knowing and willful, as taking on obligations in measured, calculable increments, exchanging their obligations for precise values. By establishing the calculating individual as the sole source of obligations, the theory sub- merges the role of the state in determining the content of parties' obligations, and works a subtle delegitimation of state power over such obligations.

What are the stakes in distinguishing between gifts and contracts, between gratuitous undertakings and those supported by consideration? In contract theory, these questions seem to restate one another, though in fact there are important differences. The current debate over the doc- trine of consideration is no longer centered on the intricacies of doctrine that engaged late nineteenth-century writers. Instead, the focus has shifted to a more straightforward normative debate over where the line between enforceable and unenforceable promises should be drawn. That focus, however, leaves intact the framework laid over one hundred years ago, which changed the face of contract theory. This Article addresses the stakes of the distinction itself, by tracing the common ground be- tween late nineteenth-century debates over the doctrine of consideration and late twentieth-century debates over the law of gifts. Ultimately, I will claim that the stakes are the constitution of a calculating individual sub- 1. Edwin W. Patterson, An Apology for Consideration, 58 Colum. L. Rev. 929, 929 (1958).

In turn, the image of the economically rational agent would justify a rhetoric of withdrawal of state power from the sphere asso- ciated with economic rationality, the sphere known as the market. But the road to such a claim is a long one, and when made in the space of a sentence must seem especially abrupt. Mitigating that abruptness re- quires a restatement of the question. What, then, are the stakes of consideration doctrine? The traditional answer has been that consideration is meant to settle a question about the legal system, the question being, which promises should the law enforce? More recently, consideration theorists have suggested that the answer to that question, in other words, the location of the line between enforcea- ble and unenforceable promises, will determine the contours of a societal value system in distinguishing between an official or business realm and a private or family realm. But both these viewpoints concentrate only on the answer to the question of consideration, rather than on the question itself. In fact, these answers displace the question of consideration. This Article posits that the placement of the question of consideration itself at the heart of contract theory has a central productive function, which is to highlight and privilege the role of promises in contract. Consideration is the technical manifestation of an underlying conceptualization of con- tract around promise, as opposed to a more diffuse idea of obligation arising in a number of ways, some less and some more voluntary. By plac- ing promise at the center of contractual obligation, consideration theory privileges a conception of contracting individuals as knowing and willful, as taking on obligations in measured, calculable increments, exchanging their obligations for precise values. By establishing the calculating indi- vidual as the center and source of obligations, the theory submerges the role of the state or the courts in determining the content of parties' obli- gations, and works a subtle delegitimation of state power over such obligations. Legal classifications are, perhaps inevitably, defined in opposition to one another. Because words acquire meaning through placement in a system of differences, one important way we know anything is by knowing what it is not. As the founder of modern linguistics pointed out, "The content of a word is determined in the final analysis not by what it con- tains but by what exists outside it. ... In a given language, all the words which express neighbouring ideas help define one another's meaning."2 Contract is recognized, in large measure, by contrasting it to its "others" in the realms of obligations and transfers of property. Thus, we recognize contract only where there is a transfer free from coercion, or what in contract parlance is known as duress. Similarly, we distinguish contract from gift. The latter distinction, between contract and gift, is a recurrent 2.

Contract is commonly understood as the law of enforceable promises, where the border of enforceability is the promise lacking consideration, or paradigmatically, the promise to make a gift. In order to grasp fully this conception of contract, it is crucial to delve into the neighboring conception of the gift. The story that moves from classical consideration theory, to modern contract theory through the gift, and finally to the individual subject is a complicated and circuitous one. It is an excavation of the not quite for- gotten artifacts that shape current thinking about contract. The digging begins in Part I under one of the most elaborate monuments in the his- tory of the common law: classical debates over consideration. Buried there, we will find the enforceable gratuitous undertaking, and perhaps some remnant of the gift. Classical theorists revolutionized consideration and contract generally, primarily by redefining it as the legal category dealing with enforceable promises. Part of this redefinition and categori- zation entailed burying the gift. But the gift is prosopopoeial; in Part II, speaking from beyond the grave, it tells us that no amount of theoretical dirt will completely fill the holes or gaps in the legal stories about who gives what to whom, in return for how much, if any, and how enforceable such giving will have turned out to be. This Part is a close reading of cases about gifts, or what the courts treated as promises to make gifts. At first glance, the old fashioned doctrinal work of Part II may seem incongruous with the theoretical abstractions of the other Parts of this Article, but such an exercise in case reading has several benefits. First, gift promises should be the easiest, most straightforward of consideration cases, so complications in this area shed light on the doctrine's ability to generate determinate answers in any realm of its application. Second, while the economic effects of the doctrine of consideration are probably greater in business cases, the cases of gifts among intimate parties tell us more about the cultural attitudes that played a major part in many of the decisions. Lastly, examination of the contradictions of the case law should remind us that despite caricatures of "the good old days," there was never a time when a commitment to formalism translated into wide- spread certainty or predictability. Part III traces the early twentieth-century theoretical responses to the changes in consideration doctrine on the one hand, and the inability of those changes to govern the outcomes of cases on the other. It argues that despite the advances of theory in considering justifications rather than simply elaborating the rules, the first generations of postclassical theory never challenged the basic framework of contract and considera- tion established by the classics. Part IV is a discussion of the advances and limitations of the current explosion of writing on gifts and consideration, which shows how much of the classical framework our current discourse retains, despite its new concerns. Finally, Part V speculates about where the impact of consideration theory falls, and attempts to flesh out the</page><page sequence="5">1880 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 stakes of distinguishing between enforceable and unenforceable promises. I. THE REVOLUTION IN CONSIDERATION DOCTRINE In the last third of the nineteenth century, English and American legal theorists3 revolutionized the doctrine of consideration.4 The result of their work was that the requirement of consideration became one of the most distinctive features of the common law, especially as a mark of its difference from European continental contract law.5 While the com- mon law roots of the doctrine of consideration go back at least to the fifteenth or sixteenth century,6 our current understanding of the doc- trine acquired its framework from the massive theorization and reformu- 3. When dealing with these theorists collectively, I will at times for convenience refer to them as "classical theorists" or "classical legal scholars." 4. What I have termed "revolutionizing" could be called "modernizing," or even "rationalizing." All these labels are apt, but I use "revolutionizing" because it mitigates a tendency to take for granted the significance of the changes brought about in the theory. 5. The significance of this distinction has since been questioned, but its standing is testified to by the opening words of a major work of comparative law: The landscape to be examined in this survey has been reported by many observers to include as one of its features a great gap, a chasm, that divides all legal systems derived from the English common law from those of the European continent. The gap is revealed by asking a short question: Can a fully capable person make a binding promise to another to give or do something for nothing? For countries within the sphere of influence of the English common law the standard answer would be no, almost never. For the more civilized countries of western Europe the standard answer would be yes, since they have never suffered from the blight that afflicts countries adhering to the English common law-the requirement of bargain consideration.

William Holdsworth explains how the term "consideration" came into the language of the law: [B]ecause the expression "quid pro quo" had thus acquired a technical meaning [expressing the conditions under which the action of debt would lie], some more general word was needed to express the act or other circumstances which had led up to or was the motive or reason for a given transaction. It is clear from the Year Books of the fifteenth and early sixteenth century that the word "consideration" was used for this purpose; and the way in which it was used shows that it had not then acquired a technical meaning. 8 William Holdsworth, A History of English Law 4 (1926) [hereinafter Holdsworth, History of English Law] (this chapter originally published as The Modern History of the Doctrine of Consideration (pts. 1 &amp; 2), 2 B.U.

The first was purification and unification, achieved by elim- inating or submerging extraneous functions of consideration doctrine and replacing them with a single question that consideration was meant to answer. That question, of course, was "which promises should the law enforce?" The second prong was to make the question of enforceable promises (or, simply, the doctrine of consideration) into the axis around which all of contract law revolved. Today, it may seem difficult to distinguish the doctrine of considera- tion from the question of which promises should be enforceable.8 The modern understanding of contract makes this an almost unquestioned common ground for beginning to think about contract.9 This is a testa- ment to the success of a revolution: Rather than experiencing its effects 7.

An illustration of how tightly bound the questions of enforceable promises and consideration are may be seen in the tite of Part I to a widely used contracts casebook: "Part I. What Promises Should the Law Enforce?-The Doctrine of Consideration." Lon L. Fuller &amp; Melvin Aron Eisenberg, Basic Contract Law 1 (6th ed. 1996). An early note attempts to clarify: "The first great question of contract law, therefore, is what kinds of promises should be enforced. The answer to that question traditionally has been subsumed under the heading 'consideration."' Id. at 6. 9. The crucial exception is Ian Macneil's attempt to "overcome the effect on perceptions of literally hundreds of years of history . . . which have led us to equate exchange with discrete transactions and contract with promise."

But nothing in the practice of contracting made such an exclusive focus inevitable. True, the rhetoric of agreement and enforcing promises is probably older than any surviving element of common law doctrine, and it will not be my claim here that promising was not an important part of contract law before classical theory made its contribution. Indeed, the relative importance of individual agreements and promises in economic organization was on the rise from the middle of the eighteenth century.10 However, the conception of contract with an exclusive focus on promise is a product of classical theorists' work and its success. The task of this Part is to elucidate the contribution of a specific doctrinal discussion, regarding the rules defining consideration, to the classical view of contract. But it is worthwhile to start with a more general account of the transformation in doctrine in order to clarify the frame- work for my discussion. Through the first half of the nineteenth century, most of what we know today as contract was discussed by legal scholars under a variety of headings, the most important of which described pairs of actors in standardized, status-like relationships. But status was not the only alternative to contract; property concepts were perhaps equally cen- tral. The obligations of standardized relationships were for the most part conceived to be defined by law rather than by agreement. The transfor- mation did not occur all at once, and there are indications of its mount- ing momentum throughout the nineteenth century.ll One of the best indications of an intermediate stage in this develop- ment is the framework offered by Theophilus Parsons in The Law of Con- tracts, first published in 1853. Whereas prior commentators (most cen- trally Blackstone and Kent) had relegated contract to the margins of property, Parsons reconceives contract as deserving of an entire treatise, in which major categories are subsumed into a wide-ranging field.12 But the content of most obligations in Parsons's schema are imposed, or at 10. John Orth has argued that up until the mid-nineteenth century, most elements of economic and social organization typically understood today as contractual were governed by a combination of property and status regimes, and that labor law was the most important transformative field, moving from status to contract in the 100 years culminating in 1850. John V. Orth, Contract and the Common Law, in The State and Freedom of Contract 44, 62 (Harry N. Scheiber ed., 1998). 11. Some of the relationships conceived of initially through property doctrines or status and only later as contract were conveyances, mortgages, sales of land, landlord- tenant relationships, marriage, leases, and most importantly, labor.

Parsons was not the first to accord contract greater importance than Blackstone had. David Lieberman has recently pointed out that William Paley's Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy (1785) accorded twice as much space to contract as to property. However, despite the fact that Paley was an influential Cambridge professor, his text has been all but ignored in the histories of the rise of</page><page sequence="8">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1883 times implied, by law. The treatise went through nine editions in the half century from its initial publication, and it was, during that time, a popular work among academics and practitioners. The opening chapter on the extent and scope of the law of contracts remained nearly constant through the nine editions, and merits quotation at some length: The Law of Contracts, in its widest extent, may be regarded as including nearly all the law which regulates the relations of human life. Indeed, it may be looked upon as the basis of human society. All social life presumes it, and rests upon it; for out of contracts, express or implied, declared or understood, grow all rights, all duties, all obligations, and all law. Almost the whole procedure of human life implies, or, rather, is, the contin- ual fulfilment of contracts... It would be easy to go farther, and show that, in all the rela- tions of social life, its good order and prosperity depend upon the due fulfilment of the contracts which bind all to all. Some- times these contracts are deliberately expressed .... Far more frequently they are not expressed at all; and for their definition and extent we must look to the common principles which all are supposed to understand and acknowledge. In this sense, con- tract is coordinate and commensurate with duty; and it is a famil- iar principle of the law ... which has a wide though not a uni- versal application, that whatsoever it is certain a man ought to do, that the law supposes him to have promised to do.... These contracts form the web and woof of actual life. If they were wholly disregarded, the movement of society would be arrested.13 For Parsons, the field of contract was occupied largely by obligations imposed by law, according to the dictates of reason and justice. The mechanism that allowed for such imposition of duties was the concept of implication, but it is a mechanism very close to status: The standardized relationships whose elaboration make up most of Parsons's work supply the putative source for the "implied" duties imposed by law.14 Thus, Par- sons enlarges the set of fact situations and relationships that are to be conceived of as contractual. However, his conception of the meaning of "contractual" does not entail a vision of legal obligation subject to the exclusive control of the parties. Parsons's vision is not yet one in which the parties to a contract make law for themselves. Indeed, his is a world replete with contractual relations, but still one in which promise is just freedom of contract.

Dealing with the broader topic of how classical theory rearranged the classification of private law, Duncan Kennedy analyzes these (and other) passages from Parsons, and calls their lack of persuasive effect the result of the "devastating assault" of classical legal thinkers.

A. Cleansing Consideration of Nonpromissory Elements The reformulation of the doctrine of consideration played a central role in redefining contract as the province of individual control, or pri- vate lawmaking by the parties. On the doctrinal plane, the strategy for this maneuver was to marginalize elements of consideration that impli- cated anything other than calculated individual control. At first glance, this formulation may seem paradoxical, since the requirement of consid- eration is itself a limitation on individual control over the disposition of obligations. Consideration is in this sense a classic instance of a limita- tion of freedom of contract, since it denies state enforcement to obliga- tions, like promises to make gifts, that do not stem from bargains. But the fact that consideration doctrine represents a limit beyond which the state will not intervene to enforce an agreement should not blind us to the positive side of the doctrine. That positive element is the enabling of parties to set the terms of their relations, and to elude state prescription regarding the content of their obligations, so long as the agreement has come about by way of exchange, or bargain. This is the sense in which contract was appealing to theorists of the time as an alternative to status: Contract represented control by individual parties over the content of their obligations to one another, while status represented societal control over that content.15 To achieve a meaningful distinction over the source of control, how- ever, it was not enough to rely on the word "contract" as opposed to the word "status." This was because up until the mid-nineteenth century, contract was still thought of primarily as the array of standardized rela- tionships whose content, more often than not, had been established by custom. One could agree or not agree to become an agent,16 but once one agreed, one was subject to duties imposed by law.17 Classical theo- 15. Again, it is worth noting that the sharp distinction between status and contract is a classical development, while for preclassical thinkers, contract was an inclusive category that included societally imposed obligation with individually undertaken obligation. In other words, much of what was later pushed into the marginal category of status was seen by preclassical theorists as part of contract. 16. But for many relationships, even entry was not voluntary. The obvious candidates for involuntary entry into "contractual" relationships are common carriers and innkeepers, who could not refuse particular customers the service they provided to the public. See Wyatt Paine, Bailments: A Commentary on the Law of Custody and Possession 199 (1901). But there were also involuntary labor relationships, at least in England, where legislation mandated wages and heavily regulated the duties of workers. See Orth, supra note 10, at 50-56. 17. Up until the early nineteenth century, agency was understood primarily as a standardized relationship, so that duties were simply state imposed legal incidents of entering into the relationship itself; from the mid-nineteenth century onward, agency was increasingly conceived of as a contract, but one whose duties were implied by law. See 1 Parsons 1st ed., supra note 12, at 68-77, 79-85 (listing various legal duties incident to the</page><page sequence="10">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1885 rists succeeded in ridding contract of much of the association of duties implied by law, in part by their reformulation of consideration doctrine. The technical aspect of this reformulation was a kind of cleanup project, in which extraneous functions of consideration doctrine were discarded, or at least made to seem peripheral and insignificant addenda to a doc- trine of major importance. What follows, then, is a discussion of several of those extraneous functions that consideration doctrine performed before the classical revolution was brought to bear on contract theory. While the doctrinal particulars of consideration discussed below may seem arcane, they are important to show how the technical features of contract doctrine were reformulated to build a general theory centered on promise. Until the classical theoretical revolution in consideration doctrine, consideration played some role in the following issues, none of which centered on the question of whether a promise was enforceable: 1) deter- mining whether an obligation could be implied, 2) determining the duty of care in an undertaking, 3) determining the extent of liability, 4) deter- mining the time when liability began, and 5) determining privity of con- tract.18 A brief explanation of each of these is required. 1. Implying an Obligation. - The first preclassical function of consid- eration lay in determining whether an obligation could be implied. The problem arose when a plaintiff had performed a service or given some- thing of value to a defendant with an expectation of receiving something relationship of principal and agent generally, and particularly factors and brokers). For the purposes of my argument, the distinction between implied and imposed duties is only mildly significant (despite the fact that the shift makes the contractual party-based vision more accessible), since the source of control is conceded to be societal in both cases. And the argument is not limited to agency; it holds for the myriad relationships that were conceived of as including duties, from bailment, to partnership, to factors and brokers, to husband and wife-the list goes on. Classical theorists tried to put agency on a wholly contractual (read: promise based) footing, claiming that extraconsensual duties (i.e., those implied or imposed by law regardless of actual consent of the parties) were anomalous. See James Barr Ames, Undisclosed Principal-His Rights and Liabilities, 18 Yale LJ. 443, 443-47 (1909). For an early and influential critique of the classical position, see Warren A. Seavey, The Rationale of Agency, 29 Yale LJ. 859, 878 (1920) (arguing that such obligations were not anomalous, but acknowledging that these were obligations "created by law" and "based upon the justice of the situation"). For a modern treatment of the issue claiming that contract theory can accommodate agency rules that appear at first glance to obviate consent, see Randy E. Barnett, Squaring Undisclosed Agency Law with Contract Theory, 75 Cal. L. Rev. 1969, 2000 (1987) (arguing that the reason undisclosed agency was seen as an anomaly for contract theory was that theoreticians were relying on a promise centered vision of contract inherited as an outgrowth of the action of assumpsit). 18. An additional issue that generated a great deal of litigation was the question of what kinds of consideration could take an obligation of surety out of the statute of frauds. Because of the technical nature of the issue, and because it could be argued that it eventually devolves to the question of whether a promise is enforceable (as opposed to void for violation of the statute), I do not include a discussion of it here. For the key cases on the issue, see Mallory v. Gillett, 21 N.Y. 412 (1860); Leonard v. Vredenburgh, 8 Johns. 29 (N.Y. 1811).</page><page sequence="11">1886 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 in return, but without having bargained for anything particular in ex- change.19 Certain kinds of consideration were sufficient to raise an obli- gation, sometimes through the construct of an implied promise, though it was clear that such implication was a legally imposed duty and had nothing to do with the will of the defendant. The clearest example of the construct-and the most important fact situation in which this kind of consideration raised an obligation-was the case of surety.20 Where the surety was called on to pay the loan and did so, she could recover from the principal debtor, without proving either a request by the debtor to pay or a promise by the debtor to repay, since the entire structure man- dating repayment would be implied by law.21 Classical consideration the- ory merged this entire problematic with two promise centered issues: the status of moral consideration, and more directly, the distinction between executed and past consideration. The strategy taken up by classical theorists had several variations, with some common maneuvers. The first was to present cases of this sort as anomalous, and then to show that other remedies, particularly a doc- trine of quasi-contract, were better equipped to deal with the situation. The second was to portray the history of contract as beginning with the true rule (i.e., that past consideration is no consideration) followed by lax interpretation of the rule, and finally a recovery of the true doctrine in the nineteenth century. The clearest example of the classical theory ma- neuver is the earliest, in Langdell's Summary: When the action of assumpsit was becoming the ordinary rem- edy for the recovery of debts by simple contract, a difficulty was experienced from the fact that a promise was indispensable to 19. Technically, any existing debt without an explicit agreement for its repayment satisfied these conditions, and the early form of pleading in such a situation was an action of debt, where no promise to pay had to be proved. See infra note 25. 20. In abstract terms, the situation is as follows: A purchases goods on credit from B, who demands some security, and accepts C as a surety. Typically, this is carried out by A giving a promissory note to B, and C indorsing the note as surety. When the note comes due, A does not pay; B demands and receives payment from C. C can then sue A to recover the payment. The relationship between A and C need not involve direct consideration between them (C's willingness to be a surety may be gratuitous, or it may be a distinct transaction for consideration), and C need not prove any promise, prior or subsequent to payment, for reimbursement. The gratuitous aspect of the relationship is not central here, because it is C's right to recompense that is interesting, since it arises through a legal construction implying an obligation, based on the fact that C has paid a debt that actually accrued to A, and not on the question of whether A promised C to reimburse her. See, for example, Swift v. Bennett, 64 Mass. 436, 436, 438 (1852), in which the defendant was a minor who bought a suit of clothes for a whaling expedition and the plaintiff was his surety, who paid for the clothes when the note came due. The court held that the plaintiff- surety could recover from the defendant. Id. at 438. 21. 1 Parsons 1st ed., supra note 12, at 391-96. That this was a genuine issue for early consideration theory is attested to by the fact of differentiation among different considerations: Some were sufficient to raise liability without any request for service or any promise of payment (such as the surety situation), while others might be sufficient to raise liability only when one of the other elements was present. See id.</page><page sequence="12">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1887 that action, while debts were often created without any actual promise. To obviate this difficulty, and to make assumpsit an available remedy in the latter class of cases, the courts invented the fiction that, wherever there was a simple contract debt, the law would imply a promise to pay it.... As the implied promise was a mere creature of the law, of course it was neither necessary nor possible that it should have a consideration in the proper sense of that term; yet it came to be the practice, in declaring upon an implied promise, to follow the analogy of a declaration upon an actual promise, by alleging that the promise was made in consid- eration of the indebtedness; and hence originated the notion of a past or executed consideration. As an implied promise does not constitute any part of the plaintiffs cause of action, and as an executed consideration will not support any other than an implied promise, of course it follows that a declaration on an executed consideration will never be good unless it states a good cause of action (i.e. a debt) independently of the promise. If this simple rule had always been understood and applied, the subject of executed consideration would have caused no trouble; but unfortunately it was not understood until within re- cent times. On the contrary, the opinion long prevailed that an executed consideration which had been performed at the defen- dant's request would support a subsequent actual promise; and hence it would follow that a declaration would never be bad be- cause upon an executed consideration, provided a request was alleged.22 After explaining why such a view would create an untenable exception to the proper doctrine of consideration, Langdell concludes: As the fiction of a promise implied by law from an executed consideration was invented merely to render the action of as- sumpsit a more extensive and available remedy, it follows that such promises can have no existence in places where the action of assumpsit has been abolished, and hence in such places the phrase "executed or past consideration" has ceased to have any legal meaning.23 Together with the ensuing discussion of "Debt," Langdell's treatment of obligations created without promises has an overriding concern, which is to show that despite consistent references to the doctrine of considera- tion in the sources dealing with such obligations, the problems of these 22.

Determining the Required Degree of Care. - A second function of con- sideration unrelated to promises, and one of importance in commercial law, was determining the level of care required in an undertaking. The most important area where this function of consideration played a role was in the law of bailment. Traditionally, bailments were a category of contract that could be binding without consideration,26 raising a problem for classical theorists interested in asserting a general rule that only promises supported by consideration could be binding. The response of classical theorists was to marginalize the law of bailments generally, ques- 24. Langdell excludes debt from contract by shifting attention to the actual transfer of property: [T]he legal mode of creating a debt is not by contract, but by grant .... It is clear, therefore, that it is the transfer of the property for a certain price, and not the previous executory contract, that creates the debt. . . . But what kind of contract is that in which the obligation arises not from a promise, but from the receipt of an equivalent for the obligation by the obligor from the obligee? Id. at 1040-41; see also id. at 1027 (discussing promises to pay for services already rendered). 25. See, e.g., 8 Holdsworth, History of English Law, supra note 6, at 14-17, 37-39 (differentiating between past and executed consideration in explaining when an obligation should be implied); Holmes, supra note 7, at 285-87, 295-97 (explaining the anomalous role of past consideration); Frederick Pollock, Principles of Contract 181-82 (7th ed. 1902) [hereinafter Pollock 7th ed.] (stating that the proposition that past consideration can be binding is based on "scanty" authority, and that the decisions, "so far as they did not proceed on the now exploded ground that moral obligation is a sufficient consideration, appear to rest on facts establishing an actual tacit contract independent of any subsequent promise"); Ames, History of Assumpsit, supra note 6, at 53-59 (discussing the relationship among debt, grant, and contract, and explaining the role of implied promises). One of the most detailed examples is Williston's treatment. After stating the rule that, generally, past consideration is no consideration, he notes that "however anomalously, a past consideration has been regarded formerly by the law as sufficient consideration, and at the present time in some of these classes [of cases] at least, the early law still persists." 1 Samuel Williston, The Law of Contracts ? 142 (1st ed. 1920) [hereinafter Williston 1st ed.]. Discussing the history of such recognition, Williston says that by the end of the seventeenth century, quasi-contractual obligations were enforced "under the guise of promises implied in law," concluding that this approach obviates the need for reference to any promises: The creditor is "amply protected both as a matter of substantive law and matter of procedure, and this without imposing the strain upon the doctrine of consideration of maintaining the exception to the general definition, involved in holding that a subsequent promise to pay the debt creates a new contract." Id. ? 143. Admitting that the question of promises is clumsy in this context, Williston concludes the section thus: That the real basis of the plaintiffs right in indebitatus assumpsit in modern times has been the debt and not the alleged promise, whether that promise was in fact real or fictitious, is shown by the circumstance that though in form the defendant in the action pleaded non assumpsit, in substance that traverse put in issue the existence of the debt.

The rule, as extrapolated from Roman law and reiterated in almost every common law discussion of bailment, was that a gratuitous bailee was responsible only for gross negligence, or held only to a slight duty of care, while a bailee for hire was responsible for negligence, or held to a duty of ordinary care.28 The distinction was still current in American case law while classical theorists were writing.29 The classical theorists' response was to claim that the duty of care was actually unrelated to the question of reward, despite explicit judicial statements to the contrary. The tactic employed was to subject cases stat- ing that consideration impacted on the degree of care to close reading and interpretation, and on the basis of those interpretations, to assert that the cases were actually based on a hidden principle of a consensually adjusted degree of care. Joseph Henry Beale's discussion is a succinct example: The proposition that I shall consider by this method is this: that the degree of care required of an undertaker is not proportion- ate to the reward, and therefore that the fact that the duty was undertaken gratuitously is immaterial, except as evidence of the extent of care undertaken. This, as I shall try to show, is the general result of the authorities, though there has been no ex- plicit decision to that effect.30 27. See, e.g., 2 Williston 1st ed., supra note 25, ?? 1038-1039 (arguing that gratuitous bailments are rarely contracts); see also infra text accompanying notes 70-77. 28. The structure was actually tripartite, rather than binary. In a bailment for mutual benefit of the parties, the bailee was held to ordinary care; in a bailment for the bailee's sole benefit, the bailee was responsible for even slight negligence, or was held to extraordinary care. See Paine, supra note 16, at 4; 2 Williston 1st ed., supra note 25, ? 1033. 29. See, e.g., Preston v. Prather, 137 U.S. 604, 608 (1891) ("The general doctrine, as stated by text writers and in judicial decisions, is that gratuitous bailees of another's property are not responsible for its loss unless guilty of gross negligence in its keeping."); Baker v. Bailey, 145 S.W. 532, 534 (Ark. 1912) ("The bailment, being solely for the bailor's benefit, was a gratuitous one, and the hotel was only bound to the use of slight care in the protection of the property and responsible for its loss only in case of gross neglect."); Sherwood v.

Determining the Extent of Liability. - A third area of preclassical contract law where consideration played a role unconnected to the en- forceability of promises was in determining the extent of damages availa- ble for the breach of a contractual obligation. Parsons, writing in 1853, made the following matter-of-fact statement regarding the issue: "[I]f an agreement be unreasonable or unconscionable, but not in such a way or to such a degree as to imply fraud, though the court will not declare the contract void, they will give only reasonable damages to a plaintiff who seeks compensation for a breach of it."32 Through the eighteenth cen- tury and into the early nineteenth, inadequacy of consideration was deemed a good reason to reduce damages from the otherwise accepted expectation measure.33 And while explicit acknowledgment of this func- tion of consideration decreased over the course of the nineteenth cen- tury, it was still applied by the Supreme Court in a case in 1889.34 The classical response was to insist that consideration was a binary variable: Either consideration was present, resulting in expectation damages for breach, or consideration was absent, resulting in no damages whatever. Classical theorists, led by Williston, claimed that the damage measure flowed from the very nature of contract, and thus could not reflect the 31. Holmes's discussion in The Common Law attempts an analogous maneuver, but with a different focus. See Holmes, supra note 7, at 164-205. Holmes works through the common law on bailment to show, contrary to popular opinion, that the law is of Germanic rather than Roman origin, and that originally, all bailees were treated equally: "Chief Justice Popham probably borrowed his distinction between paid and unpaid bailees from [Christopher St. German's 1523 Dialogue, Doctor and Student], where common carriers are mentioned as an example of the former class. A little earlier, reward made no difference." Id. at 181-82. Critique of the three-tiered structure of liability in bailment continued after the classical period. See Shelden D. Elliott, Degrees of Negligence, 6 S. Cal. L. Rev. 91, 114-15 (1933); William King Laidlaw, Principles of Bailment, 16 Cornell L.Q. 286, 306-10 (1931). For a rare modern treatment, see R.H. Helmholz, Bailment Theories and the Liability of Bailees: The Elusive Uniform Standard of Reasonable Care, 41 U. Kan. L. Rev. 97, 97-99 (1992). 32. 1 Parsons 1st ed., supra note 12, at 362. In later editions, Parsons added that in such cases, courts of equity would not grant specific performance. See 1 Parsons on Contracts 384 (3d ed., Boston, Little, Brown &amp; Co. 1857). 33. See Morton J. Horwitz, The Transformation of American Law, 1780-1860, at 164-67 (1977). Horwitz discusses the "substantive doctrine of consideration" that allowed juries to reduce damages where consideration was inadequate; for instance, noting that "[i]n Massachusetts, the eighteenth century rule was that a defendant in an ordinary contract case could offer evidence of inadequacy of consideration in order to reduce his damages."

Timing of Liability. - A fourth function of preclassical considera- tion was to determine the time from which liability began. Parsons noted that [I]f one intrusts money, goods, or property of any kind, to any person, on the faith of that person's promise to act in a certain way in reference to those goods, or that money or property, such person, having accepted the trust, will be held to his prom- ise, because the trust is itself a sufficient consideration for a promise, to discharge and execute the trust faithfully.36 Such obligations usually arose either in bailment or in agency, areas where duties arose as much out of legally defined relationships as out of agreement. He continues, "in general, an agent without remuneration cannot be required to undertake an employment or trust, or held liable for not doing so; but if he undertake and begin it, he is liable for the 35. This conflict arose in at least two settings. The first was the classical attempt to distinguish sharply between contracts and quasi-contracts, which classical theorists repeatedly claimed were not contracts at all, and breaches of which were remedied by restitution damages. Williston's textbook treatment is typical and thorough: The expression "implied contract" has given rise to great confusion in the law. Until recently the divisions of the law customarily made coincided with the forms of action known to the common law. Consequently, all rights enforced by the contractual actions of assumpsit, covenant and debt, were regarded as based on contracts. Some of these rights, however, were created not by any promise or mutual assent of the parties but were imposed by law on the defendant irrespective of, and sometimes in violation of, his intention. Such obligations were called implied contracts. A better name is that now generally in use of "quasi-contracts." This name is better since it makes clear that the obligations in question are not true contracts, and also because it avoids confusion with another class of obligations which have also been called implied contracts .... Furthermore, the measure of damages appropriate to contractual and quasi- contractual obligations differs. 1 Williston 1st ed., supra note 25, ? 3 (emphasis added). The second setting was the classical assertion that only expectation damages were appropriate for contract breach. The most famous classical statement on the singular propriety of expectation damages is Williston's contribution to the Restatement debate over remedies for breach of an obligation arising out of ? 90: Either the promise is binding or it is not. If the promise is binding it has to be enforced as it is made. ... I could leave this whole thing to the subject of quasi contracts so that the promisee under those circumstances shall never recover on the promise but he shall recover such an amount as will fairly compensate him for any injury incurred; but it seems to me you have to take one leg or the other. You have either to say the promise is binding or you have to go on the theory of restoring the status quo. 4 A.L.I. Proc. 103-04 (1926), quoted in Melvin Aron Eisenberg, The World of Contract and the World of Gift, 85 Cal. L. Rev. 821, 834-35 (1997) [hereinafter Eisenberg, World of Contract].

Perdue, The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages (pts. 1 &amp; 2), 46 Yale LJ. 52, 373 (1936-37). 36. 1 Parsons 1st ed., supra note 12, at 372.</page><page sequence="17">1892 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 consequences of neglect or omission in completing his work."37 Thus, payment or performance of some type in advance of a settled agreement generated an obligation from that point forward; in other words, consid- eration could serve to establish an obligation or liability prior to the exe- cution of an agreement.38 The response of classical theory to this problematic was to recharacterize the issue as one implicating the distinction between a tort perspective on liability and a contractual perspective. Holmes's discus- sion of the issue in The Common Law is instructive. He treats the problem as one prevalent in the early history of contract, dealing mostly with fif- teenth-century cases. After noting the rule that a "carpenter need not go to work upon another man's house at all, but if he accepts the other's confidence and intermeddles, he cannot stop at will and leave the roof open to the weather," he says, "In the foregoing cases, the duty was inde- pendent of contract, or at least was so regarded by the judges who de- cided them, and stood on the general rules applied to human conduct even by the criminal law."39 Holmes then goes on to assert that while the allegation of an undertaking conveyed the idea of contract, there was no way at the time to bind the defendant except by an instrument under seal.40 When this historical limitation was overcome by the development of liability for promises, confusion arose over the necessity of considera- tion. The confusion was settled, according to Holmes, in favor of a re- quirement of a consideration for all promises, including those whose ini- tial recovery was based on negligence (tort).41 Thus, the problem of 37. Id. at 372-73. 38. The practical significance of this issue is clarified in cases that turn on the doctrine of relation. There, we see that consideration is used to determine the time from which obligations run, even though the enforceability of the contract rests on a later, independent act. For instance, in Bellows v. McGinnis, a land purchaser's rights against a tenant accrued when consideration was complete, before the deed was executed; in other words, the execution of the deed was seen to relate the obligation back to the time when consideration was complete, so the purchaser could sue for wrongful acts committed between the time of sale and the execution of the lease. 17 Ind. 64, 66 (1861). Consideration here was not an issue of enforceability, but rather marked the time from which a defendant could be liable. The doctrine also has independent effect when a later memorandum takes an oral contract out of the statute of frauds: Liability attaches from the time of the consideration, rather than the time of the memorandum, without which the promise would have been unenforceable. For the operation of the same principle in the doctrine of ratification of agency, see Seavey, supra note 17, at 887-89. 39. Holmes, supra note 7, at 278-79. 40. Id. at 280. 41. Holmes explained: It was, perhaps, the lingering of this idea [that an action in assumpsit did not require consideration], and the often repeated notion that an assumpsit was not a contract, to which was attributable a more enlarged theory of consideration than prevailed in debt. It was settled that assumpsit would lie for a mere omission or nonfeasance.... An action for such a cause was clearly for a breach of promise, as had been recognized from the time of Edward III. If so, a consideration was necessary. Notwithstanding occasional vagaries, that also had been settled or</page><page sequence="18">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1893 when liability begins, and its relationship to the consideration, is sub- sumed in what was for classical theorists the more central question: How will a promise come to be enforceable? 5. Supplying an Exception to the Rule on Privity of Contract. - An addi- tional role of consideration unrelated to the direct question of enforce- ability of promises was as a factor in deciding whether a plaintiff could avoid the effects of the doctrine of privity of contract. Up until late in the nineteenth century, certain types of consideration afforded a plaintiff an exception to the rule that a "stranger to the consideration" (i.e., one who had not supplied the consideration) could sue to enforce rights accord- ing to the contract. This rule mandated that third party beneficiaries of contracts could not sue on them. But there was no question of whether the obligation itself was enforceable-all the discussions assume it was. The main exception was for cases where there was a "good" or "meritori- ous" consideration between the promisee and the third party-in other words, a relationship of love and natural affection between the promisee and the beneficiary-which was held to extend the rights of the former to the latter.42 The classical response to this issue was simply to call it an historical error, a misunderstanding of the true nature of consideration. Again, Langdell's discussion is indicative. He admits that Dutton v. Poole had at one time established an exception to the rule of privity, but says this had led to "untenable" results: In the case of a promise made to one person for the benefit of another, there is no doubt that the promisee can maintain an action, not only in his own name, but for his own benefit. If, therefore, the person for whose benefit the promise was made could also sue on it, the consequence would be that the prom- taken for granted in many cases of Queen Elizabeth's time. But the bastard origin of the action which gave rise to the doubt how far any consideration at all was necessary, made it possible to hold considerations sufficient which had been rejected in debt. Id. at 285. 42. See 8 Holdsworth, History of English Law, supra note 6, at 12. Holdsworth discusses the leading case of Dutton v. Poole, 93 Eng. Rep. 523 (1677), linking this rule to an equitable conception of consideration: [A]s the law stood at the end of the seventeenth century, ideas derived from the equitable conception of consideration had introduced a considerable exception to the rule that consideration must move from the promisee, which tended to obscure the common law doctrine. It was not till the decisions of the nineteenth century that this obscurity was removed. Id. at 12-13. An additional exception arose when a debt was in effect transferred from an original debtor to a substitute debtor on the basis of payment between them (with no additional payment to the creditor, who could nonetheless sue the new debtor, though there was seemingly no privity between them). In Perry v. Swasey, the defendant was a boarder of the original debtor, who agreed that he pay her debt to plaintiff rather than the rent he owed her. Chief Justice Shaw stated that "the law creates the privity, and enables the party who is to have the benefit of the promise to treat it as a consideration moving from him." 66 Mass. (12 Cush.) 36, 40 (1853). On the definition of good or meritorious consideration, see 1 Williston 1st ed., supra note 25, ? 110.</page><page sequence="19">1894 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 isor would be liable to two actions. In truth, a binding promise to A to pay $100 to B confers no right upon B in law or eq- uity..... Of course it follows that the distinction upon which Dutton v. Poole was decided is untenable; and accordingly that case has been overruled.43 There is reason to doubt the soundness of this reasoning, but the point here is not to critique Langdell's conclusions about the truth of consider- ation. Instead, the question is how eliminating this additional function of consideration helped to establish the framework for a promise centered vision of contract. For this purpose, it is worthwhile to look at how Lang- dell continues the discussion: What has been said in the preceding paragraph does not in strictness relate to the subject of "consideration"; but it was nec- essary to say it in this connection, because the case of Dutton v. Poole has given rise to the notion that the consideration of a promise need not move from the promisee, though that case really only decided that it need not always move from the person who sues on the promise. It is clear from the definition of con- sideration (?45) that it must move from the promisee. Indeed, it is of the very essence of consideration that it be received from the promisee. What is received from one person cannot possi- bly be a consideration for a promise to another person.44 The maneuver here is clear: Langdell says that this use of "consideration" is not strictly part of consideration, as he has defined it properly.45 His definition limits the law of consideration to the issue of supporting the enforceability of the promise; in turn, he will limit the scope of contract law generally to such enforceable promises. 6. Summary: Limiting Consideration to the Enforceability of Promises. Until classical theorists reformulated the doctrine of consideration, it was far from being a unified doctrine with one consistent meaning, or even one specific context for use. Although this internal differentiation or di- versity of consideration seems lately to have been forgotten, as recently as 1941 Karl Llewellyn introduced a symposium on consideration with these words: "Consideration" is not in any meaningful sense a topic. The term, as roughly used in these papers, relates to no unified body of states or problems of fact. There is instead an historically collected agglomeration of states of fact-like pebbles in pudding-stone-held together by the sole tie of being allegedly covered by "the same" legal doc- 43.

But the legal doctrines concerned are not "the same"; they are not a single body.46 In each of the areas discussed above, classical theorists attempted to cleanse the doctrine of consideration of its nonpromissory elements. In each case, the doctrine was recharacterized, shifting its contribution from determining the contents of an obligation toward the question of its for- mation. Significantly, this was an attempt to define contract as against other forms of obligation, whether rooted in gifts, in some other version of gratuitous transaction, in an idea of status, or otherwise imposed through standardized relationships.47 A quick rundown of the oppositional ideas may clarify. In purging consideration of its connection to implied obligations, classical theorists were marginalizing what they came to call quasi-contractual obligation, a type of obligation understood by all as resting on state imposition of du- ties. In denying the function of consideration regarding the duty of care or the timing of liability, theorists were submerging the importance of standardized relationships, like bailor-bailee, in determining the content of obligations between contractual partners. Finally, eliminating the function of consideration that dealt with exemptions from the require- ment of privity was a way to limit the importance of an existing status-like relationship (nearly always between a father and his dependent children) from conceptions of contract enforcement. It is worth emphasizing that my claim here is not that classical theorists invented out of thin air the important function of consideration in determining which promises the law should enforce. Rather, it has been my intention to show that consid- eration doctrine up until the late nineteenth century also encompassed a number of other questions and problems, and that classical theorists purged consideration theory of these "extraneous" elements in order to advance a promise centered conception of contract. That purging was the first prong in a two-part strategy, and I now turn to the second, posi- tive part, of generalizing the question of promise enforcement. 46. K.N. Llewellyn, On the Complexity of Consideration: A Foreword, 41 Colum. L. Rev. 777, 778 (1941) [hereinafter Llewellyn, Complexity of Consideration]. Llewellyn continues, in an argument closely analogous to the one made here: In learning or teaching or "applying" "the doctrine" of "consideration," we have rather successfully obscured the disunity of field of fact-problem and also of doctrine by several devices. The first has been to make out a field "of contract"; to call it a field of "promise" (while leaving out such promises as were traditionally or by neglect treated under other heads, but including such non-promissory agreements as we chose) ....

Generalizing the Question of Promise Enforcement The second half of the classical revolution of consideration theory was to present consideration as the answer to the question of which promises the law should enforce, and in turn to make that question into the boundary defining the scope of contract law generally. Thus, whereas contract up until the mid-nineteenth century swept in (perhaps prima- rily) an entire array of state imposed obligations entered into wholesale by some manifestation of voluntariness, classical theorists reconceived the field as including primarily obligations undertaken by rational agents who promise, and by promising, shape the contents of their own obligations. Classical theorists made consideration into the axis around which all of contract revolved. The most effective strategy for making considera- tion so central was simply to accord it heightened attention, and to show that it was a doctrine worth the investment of scholarly energy. Before the classical period, consideration, like offer and acceptance, was a minor issue in contract theory. Parsons, for instance, devoted less than five per- cent of his treatise to the combination of consideration and assent.48 In contrast, in both his casebook and Summary, Langdell devoted close to thirty percent of the work to consideration.49 In the decades following publication of Langdell's casebook, there was a veritable outpouring of writing on consideration, dealing with everything from general theories of consideration to the most intricate or "nice" questions regarding the time of consideration and to whom and from whom the consideration must move.50 48. See 1 Parsons 1st ed., supra note 12, at 353-408. Parsons devotes approximately forty-five pages to consideration, and ten to assent. As an indication of consideration's relative importance or lack thereof, this is about one-third of the space devoted to bailments. See id. at 569-722. And Parsons devoted more attention to consideration than his peers: Addison's treatise did not even have a table of contents entry for consideration, and the discussion itself occupied less than half the space of Parsons's, in a work of similar scope.

The underlying point of convergence in the debate over considera- tion was that consideration was the way to isolate those promises worthy of enforcement. This isolation was meant first and foremost to separate such promises from "gratuitous" promises, or those promises that did not have a direct and visible partner in exchange. Classical theorists repeat- edly explained the reason for the requirement of consideration in refer- ence to the nonenforcement of gratuitous promises. One typical expres- sion follows: The underlying principle of consideration would seem to be negative,-a denial that ordinarily there is sufficient reason why gratuitous promises should be enforced.

The courts have not felt impelled to extend a remedy to one who seeks to get something for nothing. English law accordingly will not usually enforce a promise unless it is given for value, or the promise of value, i.e., something which the law must assume to be of some value to the promisor and which the parties make the subject of bargain or exchange.51 While this idea had a long history in contract cases, classical theorists made it into the cornerstone of the contractual edifice. Classical consideration theorists take as the starting point the idea that consideration is required to render a promise enforceable. They conflict, not over this principle, but rather over the sometimes intricate question of whether particular classes of reciprocating promises are valua- ble enough to be counted as nongratuitous, i.e., as consideration. There are many versions of this basic conflict, including debate over the preex- isting duty rule,52 the rules on moral consideration,53 the questions sur- rounding void promises as consideration,54 and the commercially impor- tant issue of mutuality and illusory promises.55 Theorists also debated the basic question of whether consideration should be conceived of as a detri- ment to the promisee or a benefit to the promisor, or as something else, 51.

The conflicts over the shape of consideration doctrine defined con- tract theory for the coming generations, and the attempt at generaliza- tion at times brought the doctrine into disrepute, at least in critics' eyes. Even among some classical theorists, the use of consideration in fact situ- ations related to the discharge of contractual obligations seemed prob- lematic,57 and modern commentators have lamented that consideration, expanded to discharge and modification, had become a "scrap-collec- tor."58 The reconceptualization of all contract problems in terms of promise is well illustrated by the question of discharge. Traditionally, dis- charge was an issue of performance, and any executed "consideration" was sufficient to discharge an obligation.59 The theoretical problem arose when the agreement to discharge was examined independently, as a pair of mutual promises. If the substituted performance was "different," it did not raise a problem, since it could be considered a detriment to the promisee and thus a valid consideration. If on the other hand, it was simply "less"-in other words, a smaller sum of money-it could not be perceived as a detriment, making the entire agreement to discharge void 56. See Ames, Two Theories (pt. 2), supra note 7, at 29-33 (arguing that it is the promise of each party, not the legal obligation, that constitutes consideration); Holmes, supra note 7, at 292-94 (focusing on reciprocal conventional inducement while defining consideration); Williston, Bilateral Contracts, supra note 50, at 503-06 (discussing whether detriment, benefit, or past indebtedness is what the law requires for consideration). 57.

Grant Gilmore vividly describes that process: The theoretical basis having thus been provided, the next step was the extension of the newly minted theory of consideration to the entire life-history of a contract, from birth to death. Consideration theory was used to explain why offers, even if they are expressed to be irrevocable, are in their nature necessarily revocable at any time before acceptance-why modifications of going contracts under which A promises to pay B more than the originally agreed contract price for doing the work are not binding on A-why agreements by creditors to discharge their debtors on payment of less than the amount due are not binding on the creditors. For the result in each of these situations there was indeed some case law precedent, past or current, but accommodation of the cases to the newfangled theory required something like major surgery on the cases themselves.

As a conclusion to this Section, I will devote some attention to two texts, to show first, that the dominance of the promise centered vision was a fresh development in the late nineteenth century, and second, that the promise centered vision entailed a realignment of existing conceptions of private law. 1. Introducing Promise. - The fact that a promise centered vision of contract was an innovation is attested to by the leading English authority writing on the topic, Sir Frederick Pollock. In the first edition of Princi- ples of Contract, published in 1876, Pollock laments that "no such thing as a satisfactory definition of Contract is to be found in any of our books."62 He announces that not one, but a series of definitions will be required to approach "how special and complex a nature the conception really is." Pollock then begins the journey toward a satisfactory definition by noting that, although consent is often thought to be the "main thing" creating a contract, there are many noncontractual transactions that are based on consent. For consent, as "[a]greement in the widest possible sense," en- compasses any communication of common intentions: "If people make arrangements to go out for a walk . . . that is no agreement in a legal sense." Instead, Pollock argues, there is only agreement in the legal sense when the parties express a common intention such that their rights and 60. Merton L. Ferson, The Rule in Foakes v. Beer, 31 Yale LJ. 15, 15 (1921). 61. Compare Ferson's view that "[t]his doctrine is not only patently absurd but is inconvenient in commercial dealings, and, accordingly, distasteful to the courts," id., with Williston's: The application of the law of consideration to attempted discharge of liquidated claims has not infrequently been criticised by courts and law writers; and in a few jurisdictions the law has been changed by decision, or statute. But the rule of the common law has at least the merit of consistency with the general rule of consideration governing the formation and discharge of contracts. 1 Williston 1st ed., supra note 25, ? 120 (footnote omitted). Grant Gilmore commented that the doctrine engendered "a generation or more of totally unnecessary litigation," and saw it as an example of the way "the general theory of contract wreak[ed] havoc within the commercial community ...." Gilmore, supra note 58, at 37 (citation omitted). Aside from requirements contracts discussed by Gilmore, the most important commercial areas where application of the rule was problematic were (a) modification of long term contracts (especially building contracts or service agreements) and (b) readjustment of credit agreements, or what was known as composition with creditors.

It includes every kind of transaction which affects the rights of the parties and to which the consent of more than one of them is necessary. Not only contract, but every sort of conveyance is covered by it; even a conveyance by way of absolute and immediate gift. ...64 [It] includes, of course, gratuitous obligations as well as those made upon valua- ble consideration. So much as to its general contents .... [F]urther analysis is required before we can arrive at anything applicable to the special treatment of contract.65 The difficulty Pollock exposes here is how to distinguish between con- tract and other ways of dealing with property, especially conveyancing and gift-giving. Another two pages go by before Pollock reaches the dis- tinction he is after, as he moves from the general notion of common intention mutually communicated, through the Roman Stipulation, and on to a formalization of proposal and acceptance.66 Finally, the crucial distinction emerges: "[I] n the case of a contract something remains to be done by one or by each of the parties, which the other has or will have a right to call upon him to do."67 This finally leads to the conclusion that "the expression of this intention [to be bound] is accordingly nothing else than an undertaking to perform the thing he is bound to-in other words, a promise. This is the specific mark of Contract which we sought."68 The important point for us in Pollock's original introduction is the novelty of defining contract as promise. Assuming that his readers are comfortable with not only the everyday notion of consent, but also with legal notions like conveyance, and even the Roman Stipulation, he must 63. Pollock 1st ed., supra note 62, at 1-2. 64. The passage removed by the ellipsis is: (Conveyance, of course, contains something beyond agreement, namely, the transfer of property; all that is meant is that every conveyance includes an agreement.) The last item is at first sight startling, especially as there are certain ways of making a gift (otherwise than by a transfer of property) in which the assent or knowledge of the donee is immaterial. But to say that a conveyance by way of gift imports an agreement is only to say that ownership cannot be thrust on a man against his will, and in this form there is nothing strange in the proposition. And in fact there is express authority in our law to show that "it requires the assent of both minds to make a gift, as it does to make a contract" (i.e., when the gift is to take effect by way of a transfer of property to the donee), although the donee's assent is readily presumed, and therefore if money is offered as a gift but not accepted as such, the subsequent agreement of the parties may make it a good loan.

By the time of the fifth edition, only thirteen years later, Pollock is quite confident that the con- cept of contract as promise has become familiar, even dominant, allowing him to open the treatise thus: The law of Contract may be described as the endeavour of the State, a more or less imperfect one by the nature of the case, to establish a positive sanction for the expectation of good faith which has grown up in the mutual dealings of men of average right-mindedness. Accordingly the most popular description of a contract that can be given is also the most exact one, namely that it is a promise or set of promises which the law will enforce.69 Whereas only a few years earlier there was no adequate definition of con- tract available, and Pollock arrived at one only through a tortuous dissec- tion of concepts of consent and agreement, theoretical reflection has now provided a concise and most exact definition, and succeeded in popularizing it. This is not necessarily a radical change, but it should be an indication that our current conception of the link between promise and contract was not something one could take for granted before the classical revolution. 2. Using Promise to Realign Obligation. - The attention to the fine points of consideration could be considered an overt, though subtle, ave- nue for navigating promise towards its central position in contract doc- trine. But there was another avenue as well: attempting to eliminate ele- ments of what had previously been considered contract from the domain of the "new" contract. The most important such attempt involved under- takings that relied on standardized relationships rather than on promises for their content. For the most part this was done silently, by ignoring those topics altogether, pushing them out of contract, eliminating them from treatises, or diminishing the attention devoted to them. Sometimes, such categories were reclassified: moved from contract to tort, or to the new field of quasi-contract, or, as in the case of bailments, to some other newly minted field thought to be outside the scope of private law discussions. Here and there we find traces of this process in motion. One is Beale's 1891 article, Gratuitous Undertakings. Beale was at the center of a project of reclassifying private law, and the article sets out to reconsider the division of personal actions into torts and contracts, which he saw as inadequate.70 Beale first defines and distinguishes contract and tort rights: 69. Frederick Pollock, Principles of Contract 1 (5th ed., London, Stevens &amp; Sons 1889) (emphasis added). The substance of this new opening is already present in an earlier edition as a part of the introduction, published before the table of contents, that deals with Holmes's lectures on the common law, but it does not become the opening of the book until the fifth edition. 70. Beale, supra note 30, at 222.</page><page sequence="28">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1903 A contract is a right which A has (in personam) against B, because B has consented, for a consideration, or in some formal manner, to assume the correlative duty. A tort is a violation of a right which A has (in rem) against B, equally with all others, be- cause society has decreed that the corresponding duty should be laid upon every member of it.71 He then describes a kind of obligation that fits neither of these categories: Between these classes of rights exists a third; which, unlike a tort, depends upon some voluntary act by B, by which he under- takes a duty, and, unlike a contract, does not depend upon any promise of B, but only upon the mutual relations of A and B. In other words, B assumes a duty merely by voluntarily entering into a new relation towards A.72 It is crucial to note how Beale makes the conception of contract as prom- ise with consideration the centerpiece of his treatment. Beale's defini- tion of contract creates the entire problem he addresses, as it raises the necessity of finding some nomenclature to cover those cases that were traditionally treated as contracts, but no longer fit into the definition that he considers conclusive.73 Beale continues: To create such a right and duty no consideration need be shown, since no contract is necessary. As a matter of fact, en- trance into such a relationship is often the occasion of a con- tract, which may to some extent supersede the principles of the common law, and govern the rights and duties of the parties.... But even in these cases the terms of the contract seldom em- brace the whole transaction.... There is no technical name for these rights. In the old law, action for the breach of such a right was induced by an assumpsit, or, as it should be translated in such a case, he undertook. Following this old use, which is by no means uncommon to-day, I shall call a right of this sort an undertaking.74 After delineating some of the relationships to which the common law at- taches independent content, Beale comments: All these are cases where the relationship between the par- ties was voluntary; in none of them is there any contract, and in most of them the liability of B could not arise from any tort, properly so called. One of the most important classes of under- takings, however, is bailments; and for a long time it was held 71. Id. 72. Id. 73. Another author, trying to reconcile a promise centered conception of contract with liability for gratuitous undertakings, wrote: "Such liabilities, reasonable enough in themselves, are difficult to reconcile with a logical use of the English doctrine of consideration; and they may well be exceptions to its universal application in contract."

There has lately been a determined effort to controvert that doctrine, which is certainly untenable with regard to gratuitous bailments, because there is no consideration to support a contract.75 Ultimately, Beale's solution to this problem is to generate a new classifica- tion, undertakings of relational duties, and to make the duties conform to a model of implicit consent. The actual duties should be those that are consented to, even when there is no explicit mention of the duties, or when the parties rely on custom or common practice as to their content. Thus, Beale preserves the contractual idea of duties based on consent, but since there is no consideration, and usually no promise, he must find a noncontractual category to describe the undertaking. "In brief, the rule applicable in all cases of agency, bailment, or other undertaking, whether gratuitous or not, is this: The undertaker is held to such a de- gree of care and exertion in the business as in fact he undertook to bestow."76 Beale's effort to create a new classification is analogous to the at- tempts at extruding quasi-contract from contract-a project that was ad- vanced definitively in William Keener's treatise just two years after Beale's article appeared.77 This, along with the other efforts at highlighting and advocating a promise centered conception of contract, was aimed at ban- ishing relational duties from contract, and particularly at isolating and marginalizing the gratuitous undertaking, which these scholars analo- gized to the gift and to an older regime of status. Whether or not they referred overtly to Henry Maine's claim that the movement of progressive societies is one from status to contract, classical thinkers used the evolu- tionary framework to reformulate contract law. Instead of treating con- tract as encompassing status-like relational duties, classical theorists at- tempted to paint contract as a wholly consensual issue, where the parties themselves determined the content of their mutual duties. While the classical attack on gratuitous undertakings was primarily aimed at business relationships, there was also a parallel attempt to make the law of personal gratuitous transactions-namely gifts-coherent with the concept of contract advanced by the classicists. The attack on gratui- tous business undertakings was one arm of the establishment of the dona- tive promise principle; the other was a rationalization of the law of gifts. In a manner of speaking, efforts like Beale's, and the reinforcement of consideration theory as the center of contract, combined to bury the gift. 75. Id. at 223-24. 76. Id. at 231. 77. William A.

THE GIFr BEYOND THE GRAVE: CASE LAW Commentators have generally assumed that the changes in legal the- ory at the end of the nineteenth century had a deep impact on the case law of the period.78 It seems true that the style of justification employed by judges underwent significant changes.79 But there is good reason to suspect that even the establishment of a particular rule does not generate the determinate results that might be expected from the formal justification. The case law of gifts provides a crucial example that sheds light on the workings of consideration doctrine. Part I showed how classical theo- rists tried to ground consideration doctrine in the verifiable aspects of exchange. The analysis of gift cases, however, shows that the baseline for the application of consideration doctrine could never escape the ambigu- ities that the classicists were trying to avoid. Their strategy relied on iso- lating contract, making a sharp distinction between the contractual realm and other forms of obligation, notably quasi-contract and gifts. But the cases show that the gift cannot easily be contained within its boundaries. Where even rigidly formulated and widely accepted rules cannot succeed in erecting an impenetrable border, the classical strategy of isolating con- tractual obligation is threatened. A close reading of gift and gift-promise cases reveals a tension in classical contract theory. Classical theory set out to minimize the impor- tance of duties based in relationships, in part because these were per- ceived to be state imposed. Correlatively, it accorded heightened impor- tance to individual determination of the content of contractual obligations. But what happens when these two impulses conflict, when individual intentions are rooted in incalculable relationships? Gift cases exhibit such conflict. On the one hand, gifts and gift promises are made in the context of intimate relationships, where a calculable exchange is difficult or impossible to pin down. On the other hand, gift givers often manifest clear intentions to give. The tension between these two theoreti- cal directives-privileging intention while playing down relationship-is played out in the technical requirements for valid gift giving. Before delving into the case law, however, it is worth emphasizing and justifying a shift in focus from the preceding Part. In the discussion of the development of consideration and its marginalization of gratuitous undertakings, the context was primarily that of business agreements. Here, in contrast, the focus is on "transactions" that do not simply lack consideration, but rather are specifically intended as gifts. I do not pre- tend to offer an ontology of gifts or to say that a gift could never be given in the context of business; however, it is worth noting the difference in context between those cases in which a nominally gratuitous transfer is 78. See P.S. Atiyah, The Rise and Fall of Freedom of Contract 681-87 (1979). 79. See Karl N. Llewellyn, The Common Law Tradition: Deciding Appeals 35-45 (1960) (dividing periods of American legal history according to judicial styles).</page><page sequence="31">1906 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 incidental to business,80 and those in which the transfer is incidental to a relatively intimate relationship.81 Gratuitous business undertakings include, among other things, many cases of bailments, agency, surety, and guaranty (particularly surety for the debts of married women or others of limited contractual capacity, such as infants). These cases were the difficult ones for the new theory of contract in terms of categorization, because everyone acknowledged, on some level, the existence of a whole set of enforceable obligations without consideration, and thus the challenge was to distinguish these obligations from contract. But the second category, gifts, should have provided the easy case. As far as delineating a set of formal rules, it was easy for the theorists to say simply that gift promises were unenforceable. The real problem for the neatness of the theory, then, is to deal with "easy" cases that do not conform to the ideal image, which separates enforceable from unenforceable promises. Instead, the two are liable to bleed into one another by raising the same question that was supposed to distin- guish between them, i.e., why should the state intervene to enforce an obligation? In cases where some kind of fairness or justice consideration seems too weighty to be ignored, the rules begin to bend. Indeed, a close examination of the cases leaves a reader with the sense that ad hoc con- siderations of fairness and justice or propriety do much of the work in leading judges to decisions. Litigation over the validity of gifts arises almost exclusively after the donor has died. It has long been accepted that in addition to donative intent, delivery of the object of the gift is necessary to effect a valid gift. Often, this requirement is spoken of as if it were an ancient feature of the common law, but in fact, it was not established definitively until 1890.82 80. An illustrative example is the recurrent case of gratuitous bailees, such as banks, who undertake to hold securities for customers. This is gratuitous, but it is actually a collateral engagement that is parasitic on the client/service-provider relationship, which is experienced as part of business. See Preston v. Prather, 137 U.S. 604, 612-13 (1891). 81. This is not to say that gifts in intimate relationships are unimportant. As Professor Simpson reminds us in the context of rules governing the alienability of land, gifts were and remain very important in the distribution of wealth: It is easy to forget the very great significance of gifts in modern society as a mechanism for the transfer of wealth; it appears to be a somewhat neglected subject except among anthropologists.... So we distort understanding of the common law of landownership if recognition of freedom of alienation is related simply to market transactions. In the landowning class of the aristocracy and gentry the typical land transfer was the gift, either the gift inter vivos or the gift by will, rather than the sale. Gifts of property, then as now, were usually made to discharge obligations of one sort or another, but not obligations which were legally binding. A.W.B.

Thus, a declaration that A held a chattel in trust for B without delivery of the chattel was sufficient to pass equitable title to B, even though a declaration of gift would have no effect.84 Such a trust could only be enforced at equity, but in effect it meant that anyone with sufficient legal sophistication (actually knowledge of one esoteric rule) could circumvent the necessity of delivery for enforcement of gift promises. While the exceptions are interesting and important, I will postpone considering them further in order first to devote attention to the work- ings of the rules in the heart of their area of applicability. Litigation over gifts has undergone relatively dramatic changes in the last hundred years. Today, much gift related litigation is either part of a tax dispute, part of a divorce settlement, or part of a will contest where the decedent had more than one spouse during his or her lifetime. Around the end of the nine- teenth century, however, the context of gift litigation was markedly differ- Ind. LJ. 155, 161-64 (1989) (outlining the historical disagreement over the delivery requirement). In the mid-nineteenth century, some American courts ruled that gifts could be effective without delivery. See, e.g., Leddel's Ex'r v. Starr, 20 NJ. Eq. 274, 287 (Ch. 1869); Brinckerhoffv. Lawrence, 2 Sand. Ch. 400, 415 (N.Y. Ch. 1845); Ziegler v. Eckert, 6 Pa. 13, 20 (1847); see also C.R. McCorkle, Annotation, Gift of Debt to Debtor, 63 A.L.R. 2d 259, 282-86 (1959). 83. A note authored by Harlan Fiske Stone outlines some of the important exceptions: It is frequently stated in judicial opinions that in order to effect a gift of a chattel there must be a delivery of the chattel by the donor to the donee or to some third person for the donee.... Nevertheless there has probably been no time in the history of the law, certainly not since the time of Edward IV, when the statement ... was literally true, or when ownership in a chattel might not under proper conditions be transferred without a deed or other instrument and without a delivery of the chattel as an essential element in the transfer of ownership. Harlan F. Stone, Note, Delivery in Gifts of Personal Property, 20 Colum. L. Rev. 196, 196-97 (1920) (footnote omitted); see also Pound, supra note 50, at 672-75 (outlining exceptions to the requirement of consideration, among which are certain cases of enforceable parol gifts without delivery). 84. One early writer expressed his frustration at the inconsistency between legal and equitable standards regarding gifts: In reality very different standards are applied for the purpose of determining the completeness of a transfer, according as it falls on one side or other of the thin line which separates a gift from a declaration of trust. The difference amounts, in the first place, to nothing less than this,-that, if it falls one side of that line, all that is necessary for a complete transfer is to establish the intention of the donor that the transfer shall immediately take effect, while if it falls on the other side of that line, the most clearly expressed intention of the donor will not render the transfer a perfect one, unless certain formalities, laid down by the law as appropriate to such transfer, are complied with.

Litigation arose in two areas. The first, and probably most preva- lent, was a situation sometimes called the poor man's will, where a donor, in anticipation of death, attempted to give personal property to the peo- ple closest to him or her prior to death. Very often, the attempted gift was of the donor's life savings, held in a savings bank. As we will see, these cases were especially problematic for the courts. The other scena- rio that generated a great deal of litigation was the attempt to forgive loans made to family or close friends. In almost all the reported cases, the litigation is between the donee and someone representing the heirs at law of the donor/decedent. A. Formalities and Gift Promises The first goal of this Part is to show that even when the legal rules of gift transfer were well settled, those rules could not ensure like outcomes in like cases. This formulation may be misleading. It is not crucial to the argument that the identical case presented twice would have been de- cided differently by the same court.85 The claim is simply that cases that could not be distinguished on the basis of their "legally relevant" facts might generate opposite results. "Legally relevant" here refers to those facts that have a direct bearing on the rules. The pliability of outcomes opens another angle in the examination of gift cases. Even where the rules are relatively clear, two related but possibly unexpected things oc- cur: First, people still litigate the occurrences a great deal; second, peo- ple continue to behave in ways that bring them into conflict with the rules as stated. This is at least some indication that for the people who end up litigating these cases, the rules and the cases more generally have little incentive effect. But if these cases have little to do with how people will try to dispose of property, they raise the question of how legal norms might affect cultural attitudes, or more generally, how legal rules can in- fluence society.86 85. For cases where this actually happened, see infra text accompanying notes 109-114. 86. I hope to offer some kind of answer to this question in what follows, based on the idea that a particular framework within which the choice of rules is bounded has greater cultural significance than the specific rule choices adopted within that framework. But the first step in providing an explanation of the cultural significance of legal rules requires a skeptical attitude toward any simple theory of the incentive effects of rules. Sophisticated versions of such skepticism have been forwarded, and even made the basis of extended theoretical reflection. For what may be the best example, see David Charny, Nonlegal Sanctions in Commercial Relationships, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 373, 375-80 (1990) (discussing the rational use of the combination of legal and nonlegal sanctions and suggesting a model for regulation of relationships governed by traditionally nonlegal sanctions). However, the literature on gifts and consideration and on private law generally is too often motivated by an unstated economism that translates rules directly into incentives, without considering the way people might adopt, live by, succumb to, or alternatively be ignorant of or actively ignore or rebel against rules that potentially apply to their lives. Finally, another avenue to explaining the societal significance of law, which I will not pursue here despite its potential value and my intellectual alliance with those rejecting a narrow view of</page><page sequence="34">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1909 An examination of the relationship between the legal norms and the behavior of real people, then, requires an in-depth examination of the cases. While the requirements for the validity of gifts were spelled out in various ways in different cases, there were two issues that were of major practical importance.87 One requirement was that the donor intended to give the donee a gift; the second was that the donor "delivered" the ob- ject of the gift to the donee. While the question of intent occupied judges in many cases, it was the seemingly technical requirement of deliv- ery that afforded decisionmakers wide latitude in deciding whether or not a particular gift was valid. But this latitude did not arise from uncer- tainty in the formulation of the rule. Rather, as will be shown, the rule was, by the time of the cases considered, well settled. Instead, it was the application of the rule to the facts of the cases that leftjudges the oppor- tunity to decide on the validity of the gift in accordance with other con- siderations regarding the transfers. An examination of a few cases will clarify the factual context in which such gifts were attempted. The relatively straightforward litigated cases on gifts are those where the donor hands the donee a bank book or a deed or mortgage docu- ment, offering it as a gift.88 A paradigmatic example is the much cited case of Ridden v. Thrall,89 in which the donor, a Mr. Charles Edwards, incentives, is an expressivist account of the meaning of legal norms. See, e.g., Elizabeth S. Anderson &amp; Richard H. Pildes, Expressive Theories of Law: A General Restatement, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1503, 1504-06 (2000) (discussing "the pervasively expressive character of much of the law" and how it manifests the state's "attitudes"); Gillian K. Hadfield, An Expressive Theory of Contract: From Feminist Dilemmas to a Reconceptualization of Rational Choice in Contract Law, 146 U. Pa. L.

Rev. 936, 936-40 (1991) (stating that "[s]ome goals of public policy can be achieved only through certain self-understandings and more widely shared social understandings" and that "cultural consequences are a significant, but frequently ignored, dimension of public policy"); Sharon Dolovich, The Ethics of Private Prisons 78-89 (Nov. 1999) (unpublished manuscript, on file with the Columbia Law Review) (advancing an expressivist critique of private prisons). 87. Simple explanations of the requirements of a valid gift mentioned that "two things are indispensably necessary,-an intention to make the gift, and a delivery of the thing given." Newman v. Bost, 29 S.E. 848, 848 (N.C. 1898). More elaborate explanations included additional elements: The elements necessary to the validity of a gift inter vivos have been specifically stated as follows: (1) The donor must be competent to contract. (2) There must be freedom of will. (3) The gift must be complete, with nothing left undone. (4) The property must be delivered by the donor and accepted by the donee. (5) The gift must go into immediate and absolute effect. Reduced to simpler form, it is held that a gift must be voluntary, gratuitous, and absolute. Fisher v. Ludwig, 91 P. 658, 660 (Cal. Ct. App. 1907) (citations omitted). 88. A simpler case would be the handing over of cash or of a chattel, but these cases are rarely litigated. The majority of cases are those in which a symbol of indebtedness, like a bank book, is the object of the delivery. 89. 26 N.E. 627 (N.Y. 1891).</page><page sequence="35">1910 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 delivered to the plaintiff, his friendJames Ridden with whom he lived,90 a tin box containing sixteen bank books representing $40,000 in deposits. Edwards gave the box to Ridden before entering the hospital for a hernia operation, from which he feared he might die, saying that if he should not return, the box and everything in it was to belong to Ridden. The operation was a success, but Edwards died of heart failure while still in the hospital recovering (as it were) from the operation. The court held the gift valid.91 The delivery of the bank books in the tin box was testified to by the plaintiffs wife and corroborated by a letter that Edwards left in a bureau in the room he occupied in the plaintiff's house.92 The court, noting the significant size of the deposits, stated that "[s]uch a gift should be proved by very plain and satisfactory evidence, and, if the case de- pended upon the evidence of the wife alone, any court might well hesi- tate to uphold the gift."93 The corroboration provided by the letter was sufficient to quell any doubts about the authenticity of the delivery. This seemingly straightforward case touches on several issues that re- quire exploration individually. First, there is the question of what acts will amount to a sufficient delivery; second, the question of what evidence will be sufficient to establish the making of a gift; and finally, and closely related to the first two issues, the question of the relationship between the acts of delivery and the intention to make a gift. 90. The fact that Edwards lived with Ridden is difficult to glean from the Court of Appeals opinion, but is clear in the decision of the General Term. Ridden v. Thrall, 7 N.Y.S. 822, 823 (Gen. Term 1889). 91. Ridden, 26 N.E. at 628. The court explained: The gift was consummated by the delivery of the books, and no other formality was needed to constitute the actual delivery of the bank deposits needful to vest the possession and title in the donee. In savings banks in this state such deposit books are issued as evidence of indebtedness of the banks .... The decisions are not entirely harmonious as to the sufficiency of the mere delivery of such deposit books to constitute a valid gift, either inter vivos or causa mortis. But the general rule in England and in this country, and particularly in this state, is that any delivery of property which transfers to the donee either the legal or equitable title is sufficient to effectuate a gift; and hence it has been held that the mere delivery of non-negotiable notes, bonds, mortgages, or certificates of stock is sufficient to effectuate a gift. Id. at 628-29 (citations omitted). 92. Id. at 628. The letter was addressed to the plaintiff, and read: Friend Jim: Should I not survive from the effects of the operation about to be performed on me at St. Luke's Hospital, this is my last will and request, that you will take charge of my body, and have it placed in my family plot in Greenwood Cemetery; and also that you will take full charge of all my personal effects of every kind, and to have and hold the same unto yourself, your heirs and assigns, forever. You will find my papers and all my accounts in the box. C.H. Edwards. Id. 93. Id.</page><page sequence="36">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1911 B. What Counts as Delivery ? The question of which acts will amount to a sufficient delivery is com- plicated by the fact that in most of the litigated cases a gift is made of a chose in action, typically the debt of a bank to a donor, or the debt of the donee to the donor. Because these gifts are not simple chattels, and thus cannot be delivered in themselves, the question is what object will suffice to symbolize a delivery.94 In Ridden and many cases like it, the gift is a deposit in a bank, and the bank book is held out as the best symbol of the asset.95 However, while savings bank accounts were susceptible of being given through such delivery, many courts held that checking accounts or accounts in banks of general deposits could not be given through delivery of the pass book.96 More complex cases arose when donors attempted to make a gift by forgiving a debt. Some examples should make the problems embedded in these questions clearer. 94. The question of whether symbolic delivery was ever sufficient plagued theorists and bothered some courts. Holdsworth claimed that symbolic delivery was never sufficient, but that in certain cases, "constructive" delivery was sufficient: Moreover it is clear, as Sir F. Pollock has shown, that the common law throughout its history has demanded an actual, and not merely a symbolic delivery. The delivery of a key of the safe or warehouse, where the goods to be transferred are deposited, is not a symbolic delivery; "it is argued," said Lord Hardwicke, "that though some delivery is necessary, yet delivery of the thing is not necessary, but delivery of anything by way of symbol is sufficient; but I cannot agree to that; nor do I find any authority for that in the civil law, which required delivery to some gifts, or in the law of England which required delivery throughout." It is true the delivery of the key of bulky goods "has been allowed as delivery of the possession, because it is the way of coming at the possession or to make use of the thing, and therefore the key is not a symbol which would not do." . . . [I]t is clear that in these cases there is no symbolic delivery. Rather there is an agreement as to the character in which possession is held, or as to the whereabouts of the possession or ownership, adapted to the special circumstances of the parties to the particular transaction. 7 Holdsworth, History of English Law, supra note 6, at 503-04. American courts usually did not distinguish between constructive and symbolic delivery, accepting both terms. But see Newman v. Bost, 29 S.E. 848, 851 (N.C. 1898) in which, after discussion of the diversity of holdings in different states requiring either symbolic or constructive delivery, the court held that "[t]here is no such thing in this state as 'symbolical delivery' in gifts either inter vivos or donatio causa mortis." 95. See, e.g., Fisher v. Ludwig, 91 P. 658, 660 (Cal. Ct. App. 1907) (holding that savings bank deposits may be transferred by delivering the pass book); McCoy's Adm'r v. McCoy, 104 S.W. 1031, 1031-32 (Ky. Ct. App. 1907) (stating that "[t]he authorities hold, almost without exception, that the delivery of a pass or deposit book in a savings bank transfers the money on deposit to the donee," citing six cases from different jurisdictions); see also 1 Williston 1st ed., supra note 25, ? 439, at 837-38 n.54 (citing additional cases). 96. See, e.g., Jones v. Weakley, 12 So. 420, 421 (Ala. 1893) (holding that delivery of the pass book in "a bank of issue, discount, and deposit" would not validate gift, though the same delivery of a savings bank pass book would). But see McCoy, 104 S.W. at 1032 (rejecting the distinction between savings banks and banks of deposit, holding that delivery of the pass book in either case would perfect the gift). For a discussion of the issue and critique of the distinction, see Harold C. Havighurst, Gifts of Bank Deposits, 14 N.C. L. Rev. 129, 133-35 (1936).</page><page sequence="37">1912 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 Complex forms of delivery raised ambiguities for the courts. For ex- ample, sometimes donors did not deliver the bank book or note in ques- tion itself, but rather some means of attaining them, for instance, a key to a safe deposit box or trunk where the bank book or note was kept. Courts divided internally (majority and dissenting opinions within partic- ular cases), and externally (among cases with similar facts), over whether the key to a trunk, a safe, or a safe deposit box in a bank could suffice as delivery.97 97. In Phipard v. Phipard, plaintiffs were the four sons of the deceased, who had taken out a life insurance policy and repeatedly said that the policy was for the benefit of his children. 8 N.Y.S. 728, 729 (Gen. Term 1890). The court held that in addition to a valid trust created by parol, the policy was in effect delivered to one of the plaintiffs as a gift. Id. at 729-30. The deceased had given his son, Harvey, one of the plaintiffs, "the key to the box in the safe-deposit vaults in which the policy was kept, together with an order directed to the custodian of the vaults to deliver the box to his son, whom he directed to take possession of it." Id. at 730. Treating the question of whether the key to the deposit box could suffice as delivery, the court said: [B]y the delivery of the key to this plaintiff, who was the eldest son of the assured, accompanied with the order for the box containing the policy, and the instrument attached to it, a constructive delivery was made, and that was sufficient for all the purposes of the law; for an actual delivery to render a gift complete is not necessary, but a symbolical delivery will be sufficient. Id. The dissenting opinion took the opposite view of the facts: The mere fact that the testator, previous to his death, delivered to the plaintiff the key to his safe-deposit box, in which box these papers were, together with an order for the delivery of said box, showed no intention to deliver, by that act, these papers. It is not claimed that the plaintiff could claim any of the rest of the contents of the box because of this alleged delivery, and how is any distinction to be made? Besides, as has been already said, there is no finding that the papers in question were ever delivered, which is essential to the plaintiffs' success. Id. at 731 (Van Brunt, PJ., dissenting). The division is instructive precisely in its lack of legalistic discussion. Thejudges agree that delivery is essential to the validity of the gift. It appears they also agree that in principle, delivery of a key to a safe deposit box may amount to sufficient delivery. But when put to the test of deciding whether it does in fact do so, they divide, without further discussion: The majority says, "a constructive delivery was made, and that was sufficient," while the dissent says simply that no delivery was made. Another typical case is Reynolds v. Reynolds, where the donor was ill and went to stay with family members, the plaintiffs, who took care of her. 45 N.Y.S. 338, 339 (Sup. Ct. 1897). On the morning before she died, the donor said that she wanted the plaintiffs to have everything. She took some keys out from under her pillow, and gave them to the nurse, who handed them to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs then removed a tin box from the trunk at the foot of her bed, and left the room. This was considered sufficient delivery of the bank book contained in the box, and the gift was thus upheld. Id. at 340-42. But courts were far from unanimous in accepting delivery of keys. One court explained its reluctance to find delivery in the handing over of a key to a trunk by saying that it would be a "dangerous extension" of the forms of valid gifts: Cogent reasons may be given for protecting the thousands of depositors in savings banks ... in relation to the contents of safe deposit boxes and vaults of which the owners hold the key. Mrs. Kane's pass book was not the actual subject of her alleged gift, but, rather, a symbol of such gift. The key was therefore, at most, a symbol of a symbol of a gift. The delivery of the key of a trunk containing so many different articles which Mrs. Kane might desire to have taken from it for</page><page sequence="38">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1913 Another form of complex delivery arose in cases where delivery of the gift was made to a third party, with instructions to deliver the gift to the intended donee. In Partridge v. Kearns, for instance, the donor made out a note for $200 with the intention of giving it to the plaintiff for the benefit of her infant sons.98 She gave the note to a third party, and two days before her death instructed the latter to give the note to the plain- tiff. Reversing the conclusions of the trial court, the Appellate Division held that "there was no delivery of the thing" and that there was "none of the formality necessary to pass title."99 On essentially the same facts, how- ever, many courts considered delivery to a third person sufficient to pass title and to create a valid gift.100 Some of the most complicated discussions of the sufficiency of deliv- ery arose in the context of joint accounts, which were often opened with the intention of assuring the transfer of the contents of the account to the donee. Typically, a donor would open a joint account with the do- nor's own funds, or change an existing account from her own name into so many different purposes is an act in itself far less significant of a gift of any particular articles in the trunk than the manual delivery of the trunk itself. Dunn v. Houghton, 51 A. 71, 76 (NJ. Ch. 1902) (holding that there was no gift causa mortis by delivery of the key, but upholding the gift on the ground that the bank accounts themselves had already been valid gifts in the life of the donor); see also Gescheidt v. Drier, 20 N.Y.S. 11, 11 (Gen. Term 1892) (holding delivery of keys to wardrobe insufficient); Pink v. Church, 14 N.Y.S. 337, 337 (Gen. Term 1891) (holding delivery of key to a safe vault sufficient). 98. 53 N.Y.S. 154, 154 (App. Div. 1898). 99. Id. at 155. 100. For example, in Bump v. Pratt, the court stated: To constitute a valid gift . . there must be such an actual or constructive delivery of the possession as to place the subject of the gift beyond the possession and control of the donor, and placed in the actual possession of the donee, or of some person for the donee. Assuming, as I think we must, that the referee's findings of the question of fact upon this point are supported by the evidence, then there was a delivery of these bonds by the intestate in her lifetime to Miss Cornell for the defendant Pratt, with directions that they should at some time thereafter be delivered to the donee. That, we think, within the authorities, was such a parting with the possession by the donor, and delivery to another for the donee, as to vest the title in the donee. 32 N.Y.S. 538, 540 (Gen. Term 1895). In Langworthy v. Crissey, a case involving the gift of a promissory note, the court stated: A delivery to the donee in person is not necessary. A delivery of the thing granted to another person for the use of the donee is sufficient, and the donee's subsequent demand of the property given, and his efforts to obtain possession thereof after the same has come into the hands of the donor's executor, is evidence of his acceptance of the gift. 31 N.Y.S. 85, 86-87 (Sup. Ct. 1894) (quoting the "marginal note" of Hunter v. Hunter, 19 Barb. 631, 631 (N.Y. Sup. 1855)). In In re Essex's Estate, delivery to a third party was held sufficient, with the court going further and stating, "In case of gifts causa mortis physical possession of the property is not necessarily parted with by the donor." 20 N.Y.S. 62, 63 (Sur. Ct. 1891). In In re Hall's Estate, the court stated: "It has been distinctly held in many cases that the delivery may be made to a third party for the donee, and that such delivery will be sufficient ...." 38 N.Y.S. 1135, 1139 (Sur. Ct. 1896).</page><page sequence="39">1914 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 a joint account. Most often, the assumption underlying the change was that the donor would continue to have access to and control over the funds during her lifetime, but that the donee would become sole owner of the account at the donor's death. In some circumstances, courts were willing to go to great lengths, even reversing straightforward findings of fact on delivery when no contradictory evidence was presented, to rule that there was no sufficient delivery.101 On the other hand, there were situations in which courts simply ignored problems of delivery in order to validate the gift.102 The contrast among the cases shows that even the widely accepted formula that valid gifts require delivery and that delivery requires the surrender by the donor of dominion over the gift103 was flex- ible in the hands of judges who saw reasons to vary their conclusions in particular cases.104 101. An interesting example is the case of De Puy v. Stevens, where the plaintiff was a friend of the deceased donor, Nancy Sibbalds. 55 N.Y.S. 810, 811 (App. Div. 1899). Six weeks before her death, the donor withdrew the funds from a savings account, and redeposited them in an account "in the name of 'Mrs. Nancy Sibbalds or Miss Hattie De Puy' [the plaintiff] . . . 'Either or survivor to draw."' Id. at 811. (The plaintiff was the donor's agent for these changes in the account.) Uncontradicted evidence showed that the donor, handing the bank book to the plaintiff, said, "'It is yours; take it, and put it away, and take good care of it;' that the plaintiff then said, 'They will talk after this,' whereupon Mrs. Sibbalds replied, 'What do you care? You are all right."' Id. at 812-13. The trial court held that these actions were sufficient to establish the gift inter vivos, and to create a right of survivorship in the account. The appellate court reversed, saying that the evidence did not support the claim that the actions showed the deceased's intention to make a gift of the funds in the account, defeating both the gift and the claim of survivorship. Id. at 813-15. I will return to two of the issues raised in this ruling, the question of evidence and the question of intent, later in this Section. 102. In Kelly v. Beers, the donor changed her savings account so that she or her daughter, the donee and plaintiff, could draw from the account, with the survivor to retain control. 86 N.E. 980, 984 (N.Y. 1909). The plaintiff and the deceased lived together, and the bank book was kept in a locked trunk in the house, to which they both had keys. The trial court held that the change in account did not amount to a valid gift or the creation of joint ownership or survivorship in the account. Id. at 982. The Court of Appeals reversed, and without dwelling on the possibility of the lack of delivery, said: The controlling question for us has been, and is, whether [the donor] intentionally and intelligently created a condition embracing the essential elements of joint ownership and survivorship. If she did, that was sufficient, even though she did not use any particular formula in doing it. Her acts and repeated declarations indicate that she did intend to do just that which is denied, give to her daughter joint ownership in and control over this account. Id. at 984. 103. One of the most quoted formulations of the rule is as follows: "[D]elivery by the donor, either actual or constructive, operating to divest the donor of possession of and dominion over the thing, is a constant and essential factor in every transaction which takes effect as a complete gift."

The Standard of Evidence Ambiguity over the required standard of evidence to prove a gift be- came an important mechanism in affording judges flexibility in deciding cases on gifts.l05 While there was some conflict among courts over the proper standard of evidence required to establish a valid gift, even the most quoted formulae describing the standards were vague enough, and encompassed enough contradictory corollaries, to allow judges to decide relatively unconstrained by the legal standard. The suspicion of claims of gifts, resulting especially from the fact that deceased donors could not testify as to whether or not they actually made a donation, led judges to seek stronger evidence before validating such claims.106 One court, deal- ing with what it viewed as an inherently improbable claim of a gift, stated: donor with her sister did not create gift or right of survivorship, even where there was evidence of intent to make gift and of delivery of pass book), Schippers v. Kempkes, 67 A. 74, 74-75 (NJ. 1907) (holding account made out to donor and donee created neither gift nor right of survivorship), Cunningham v. Davenport, 41 N.E. 412, 413-14 (N.Y. 1895) (holding account opened in trust for donee did not effect gift or trust, when other circumstances show lack of intent), and Krummel v. Thomas, 25 N.Y.S. 833, 834 (Gen. Term 1893) (holding deposit in donee's name insufficient to establish gift without delivery of pass book to donee), with Appeal of Buckingham, 22 A. 509, 509-11 (Conn. 1891) (stating that creation of joint deposits by donor with her nieces was valid gift creating right of survivorship, without delivery of the pass books, but ordering new trial on other grounds), Bangs v. Browne, 112 N.W. 1107, 1108 (Mich. 1907) (holding, where donor opened separate account for donee without informing her, and pass book was left with bank, that there was a valid gift), Dunn v. Houghton, 51 A. 71, 77 (NJ. Ch. 1902) (holding creation of joint account was contract with the bank for donee's benefit, making delivery unnecessary, and the whole question of delivery inapplicable to validity of the gift), Decker v. Union Dime Sav. Inst., 44 N.Y.S. 521, 522-23 (App. Div. 1897) (holding deposit by a brother in trust for his sister was valid irrevocable gift, without delivery of pass book), McElroy v. Nat'l Sav. Bank of Albany, 40 N.Y.S. 340, 341 (App. Div. 1896) (holding joint deposit by husband in his and his wife's name created valid gift and right of survivorship, even without delivery of the pass book), and Hannon v. Sheehan, 22 N.Y.S. 935, 936-37 (C.P. N.Y. County 1893) (holding gift valid because delivery was inferred where pass book for joint account ended up in the hands of sister who lived with donee). 105. The question of the standard of evidence required to prove a gift (usually to prove delivery of the gift) should be distinguished from the question of evidence as a justification for the requirement of delivery. Judges, and then theorists, often spoke of delivery as a formality, necessary to provide evidence of the gift, and particularly as a prophylactic against fraud. See infra notes 108-119 and accompanying text. The evidentiary justification of delivery, however, has no necessary relationship to the standard of evidence required to prove the delivery. 106. In fact, while the donor was silenced by death, the donee was often silenced by the rules of evidence, which in some states made it impossible for the claimant to testify that he or she had been given a gift by the donor, since testimony against the executors of an estate regarding a transaction with the deceased could not be given by a party to the transaction. See 2 N.Y. Code Civ. P. ? 829 (Bliss, 4th ed., New York, Baker, Voorhis &amp; Co. 1895) ("[A] party or person interested in the event . . shall not be examined as a witness . . . against the executor, administrator or survivor of a deceased person . . . concerning a personal transaction or communication between the witness and the deceased person ....

Although it may not be true that the law presumes against a gift, it certainly does not presume in its favor, but requires proof of it.107 Courts divided over what such proof consisted of. Did "clear and convincing, strong and satisfactory" evidence amount to anything more than a preponderance of the evidence, as required generally in civil cases? Some courts believed that this was precisely the question, and that it should be answered affirmatively.108 In many cases, finding evidence that was clear and convincing, or "strong, clear, and conclusive," became a stumbling block, or an excuse, depending on one's perspective, preventing the finding of valid gifts. The details of some of the cases merit attention. In Podmore v. South Brooklyn Savings Institution, the deceased gave a number of bankbooks to the donee, a Mrs. Reilly.l09 The deathbed scene in which the donor, just prior to her death, gave Reilly the bank books was described by two inde- pendent witnesses. The trial court found for the defendant, validating the gift.ll0 The Appellate Division reversed, saying that while there was inde- (excluding testimony offered by defendants concerning personal transaction with the deceased); Rogers v.

Bank for Savings, plaintiff claimed that the deceased, who had boarded with her for eight months prior to his death, gave her his bank book before he died, saying she should have the money for the kindness and care she showed him. 52 N.Y.S. 142, 143, 146 (App. Div. 1898). Witnesses testified to the delivery of the bank book to the plaintiff, and that the deceased did not want his son to inherit any of his money. Id. at 144, 146. There was conflicting testimony as to events after the death of the donor, regarding statements made by the plaintiff about the donor's property. Id. at 147-48. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, but the Appellate Division reversed, saying: The rule of law which governs the disposition of cases involving gifts inter vivos and causa mortis, so far as cogency of proof is concerned, is somewhat different from the strength of evidence usually found sufficient for the establishment of contracts, the rights of parties arising thereunder, and of other similar questions. The reason for this rule is found in the fact that fraud may be quite easily perpetrated, that weakness and uncertainty of will are often attendant upon the donor, and temptation to construe an act and circumstances into a gift, by reason of interest, presses strongly upon the donee. For these and other reasons the courts have uniformly hedged about the establishment of these gifts [with] somewhat unusual requirements, and have insisted that the proof in support thereof shall be strong, clear, and conclusive. Id. at 142-43. 109. 62 N.Y.S. 961, 963 (App. Div. 1900). 110. Id. at 962-63. The suit was brought by the donor's administrator against the bank; the donee had, prior to the suit, presented the bank book and received payment, and the administrator challenged the propriety of the payment. Id. at 961-62. Suits were also brought against the other banks in which the deceased had accounts. See Mahon v. Dime Sav.

One is tempted to ask, if this evidence is not clear and convincing, what could be? The mystery deepens upon consideration of a later decision of the same court, with an almost identical panel, in a case originating from the same facts. In Mahon v. Dime Savings Bank of Brooklyn,ll2 the Appellate Division reversed a finding of ajury as against the weight of the evidence, holding that the evidence of the gift, including evidence of the identity of the bank book, was sufficient.ll3 The facts of the Podmore gift generated almost all the legal outcomes available, with the only point of contention being whether "clear and convincing" evidence existed regarding the identity of a specific pass book.ll4 The search for evidence identifying a particular pass book seems even more peculiar when contrasted with cases where witnesses only saw a box, or even keys to a box, being deliv- ered, but the identity of the pass books was never raised as an issue.ll5 administrator, invalidating the gift, in a suit against both Dime of Williamsburgh and the Brooklyn Savings Bank); Podmore v.

Podmore v. S. Brooklyn Sav., 62 N.Y.S. at 963-64.

Brooklyn Sav. consisted of Van Brunt, PJ., Barrett, McLaughlin, Patterson, and O'Brien, JJ., 62 N.Y.S. at 961. Was the replacement of Barrett by Laughlin a critical factor? Or is this simply direct "white horse case" evidence of arbitrariness in the outcome of gift cases? 114. The same maneuver occurs in In re Wiegel's Estate, 28 N.Y.S. 95, 100 (Gen.

When the claimant of a gift has possession of the bank book, any demand for "clear and convincing" evidence (if the phrase has any meaning) creates a presumption against the gift. But a presumption against the gift is far from neutral: It is, in effect, a presumption of theft on the part of the claimant.16 Some courts glossed over without comment the fact that a search for weightier evidence was tantamount to calling claimants thieves.17 Other courts were willing to intimate that the claimants were larcenous,18 while still others articulated their distaste at the prospect of insinuating a crime onto the claimant.119 It is sometimes thought that strict rules of evidence are oriented to- ward limiting the discretion of legal decisionmakers. In turn-of-the-cen- tury gift cases, however, the rules of evidence, and especially the formula requiring clear and convincing evidence, opened up wider latitude for judges, offering an additional justification with a legalistic ring where some other, more case-specific, factor appears to have motivated the decision. 116. At least, this is the case where the question is evidence of the delivery of the gift, where delivery is the only evidence of donative intent. This is a concrete doctrinal manifestation of the phenomenon Carol Rose has called the "gift leak[ing] into ... theft." See Carol M. Rose, Giving, Trading, Thieving, and Trusting: How and Why Gifts Become Exchanges, and (More Importantly) Vice Versa, 44 Fla. L. Rev. 295, 302-08 (1992) [hereinafter Rose, Giving, Trading]. 117.

Bank for Sav., 52 N.Y.S. 142, 148 (App. Div. 1898). 118. See, e.g., Alsop v. Southold Sav. Bank, 21 N.Y.S. 300, 302 (Gen. Term 1892) (reversing finding in claimant's favor despite testimony to event of gift, because "[t]he deceased is entitled to a vigilant scrutiny of the evidence, where she was in so unprotected a situation in respect to property which could be transferred by delivery"). The court in Podmore v. Dime Sav. Bank of Williamsburgh was even more explicit: The fact that the donee had possession of this particular bank book is no evidence of a gift; more especially as she and others had opportunity to take it both before and after the decedent's death. Possession of the chattels of a deceased person either before or after his death is no evidence of a gift. The law presumes nothing from it; and independent of it there must be that "clear and convincing, strong and satisfactory" proof which is required to make out a gift causa mortis, in order to prevent fraud and larceny. 60 N.Y.S. 533, 534 (Sup. Ct. 1899), affd, 66 N.Y.S. 1071 (App. Div. 1900). 119. For example, in Devlin v. Farmer, reversing a referee finding that there was insufficient evidence of delivery, the court said, "Of course, plaintiff may, when she went to the trunk at her uncle's request to get the bonds, have feloniously, and without his knowledge, abstracted the bank-books; but, as far as can be judged from the evidence... I should have been loath to adopt that theory." 9 N.Y.S. 530, 531-32 (C.P. N.Y. County 1890), rev'd sub nom. Devlin v. Greenwich Sav. Bank, 26 N.E. 744 (N.Y. 1891). In Gibbs v. Carnahan, rejecting the requirement of a standard of clear, convincing, strong and satisfactory evidence, the court pointed out the inconsistency between what amounts to a presumption of fraud or theft in the case of gifts and the presumption against such a charge in civil actions. 25 N.Y.S. at 787.</page><page sequence="44">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1919 D. Intention Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the judicial opinions on gifts is the role of intention. At a time when the objective theory of contracts was ascendant, judges in gift cases seem to have been consistent in search- ing out the subjective intention of a deceased donor, and often with the assumption that the intention was at odds with the donor's objective be- havior. But more interesting than this binary split between objective and subjective theories is the tension among the different roles that intention could play in deciding the cases. Some opinions articulate the view that the role of the court is to attempt to effectuate the intention of the do- nor.120 But other courts note that the rules pertaining to gifts are a limi- tation on effectuating intentions.121 One of the most quoted articula- tions of this view comes from Beaver v. Beaver. Anything short of [delivery] strips [the gift] of the quality of completeness which distinguishes an intention to give, which alone amounts to nothing, from the consummated act, which changes the title. The intention to give is often established by most satisfactory evidence, although the gift fails. Instruments may be even so formally executed by the donor, purporting to transfer title to the donee, or there may be the most explicit declaration of an intention to give, or of an actual present gift, yet, unless there is delivery, the intention is defeated.122 In some cases, formalities were viewed and employed as obstacles to effec- tuating the actual intention of the donor.123 But Beaver's oft-quoted for- 120. One example is McCoy's Adm'r v. McCoy, where the donor had delivered the pass book to a bank account to her son prior to her death. 104 S.W. 1031, 1031 (Ky. 1907). Upholding the gift, the court said: The mere fact that a check might be better evidence of the intention to make the gift complete will not be allowed to defeat the purpose of the donor. In this class of cases, as well as others, the intention of the giver must be looked into. The purpose with which the delivery is made must be considered; and from the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction the court or jury trying the case must determine whether or not the gift was designed to be and was completed. Generally the delivery must be as perfect as the nature of the property will admit; but the manifest desire of the donor will not be set aside by a narrow construction that would defeat his purpose. Id. at 1032. 121. The clearest case of the limitation on freedom of gift is that of the donor who attempts to effectuate a testamentary donation without a will. 122. 22 N.E. 940, 941-42 (N.Y. 1889). 123. The prototype for this kind of case is the widely cited case of Young v. Young, in which the court invalidated an attempted gift of bonds by a father to his sons because of a lack of formal delivery. 80 N.Y. 422, 430 (1880). Acknowledging that the intention to do so was clearly manifested, the opinion opens: The intention of Joseph Young deceased to give the bonds in controversy on this appeal to his son William H. Young, reserving to himself only the interest during his life-time, was so clearly manifested, that we have examined the case with a strong disposition to effectuate that intention and sustain the gift, if possible. Id. at 422.</page><page sequence="45">1920 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 mulation does not actually represent the theory of that case. Beaver did not present a situation where a gift was attempted without regard to the proper formalities, causing the gift to be defeated. In fact, just the oppo- site is true. The supposed donor, John Beaver, made a deposit in a bank in the name of his son. The court agreed that this was objectively consis- tent with an intent to make a gift.124 But the court found that it was more likely in this case that the actual intention of the "donor" had nothing to do with making a gift to the "donee" named in the pass book. "We can- not close our eyes to the well-known practice of persons depositing in savings banks money to the credit of real or fictitious persons, with no intention of divesting themselves of ownership."125 The court thought that validating the gift would subvert the real intention of the depositor: "We are inclined to think that to infer a gift from the form of the deposit alone would, in the great majority of cases, and especially where the de- posit was of any considerable amount, impute an intention which never existed, and defeat the real purpose of the depositor."126 Thus, while the case is often quoted as standing for the proposition that intent alone, lacking the proper formality, will not be enough to validate an attempted gift,127 its holding is actually based on a finding that despite fulfillment of the formal requirements, there was no intent to make a gift. The Beaver case provides a good introduction to the complexities of intention in gift cases. One thing it shows is that any simple opposition between formalities and intent is too reductive to explain the role of in- tent. The simple view might claim that a tension emerges from the inevi- table generality of any rule that sets out to achieve a policy objective. Here, the policy objective implied in requiring formality in gifts (the for- mality being delivery) is twofold: to supply evidence (or reduce the likeli- hood of fraud), and to ensure deliberation on the part of the donor. The foreseeable tension arises, in theory, when donors have every intention of making a proper gift, but do not succeed in delivery. Anyone advocating a rule that mandates some level of formality realizes that intention will have to be sacrificed some of the time, but that is seen as the price of procuring the policy objective. This view, however, misses one of the im- portant uses of intention in the gift cases, which is to invalidate the gift despite the fact that the formalities have been carried out. 124. Beaver, 22 N.E. at 942. 125. Id. The court continued: It is attributable to various reasons,-reasons connected with taxation, rules of the bank limiting the amount which any one individual may keep on deposit, the desire to obtain high rates of interest where there is a discrimination based on the amount of deposits, and the desire on the part of many persons to veil or conceal from others knowledge of their pecuniary condition. Id. 126. Id. 127. See, e.g., In re Small's Will, 50 N.Y.S. 341, 346 (App. Div. 1898); Dinlay v. McCullagh, 36 N.Y.S. 1007, 1008 (Gen. Term 1895); In re Taber's Estate, 63 N.Y.S. 728, 734-35 (Sur.

Ct. 1895).</page><page sequence="46">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1921 Importantly, the complexities of intention do not stem from a con- flict over the rules of valid gifts. Instead, this is a conflict played out in courts' interpretations of the facts before them. A good example is Kirk v. McCusker,128 in which two judges offered radically different interpreta- tions of the same facts. The donor, Margaret Kirk, was ill. She delivered two bank books to her friend, Bridget McCusker, with a note saying, "If anything happens, I leave all the money I have in the bank to Bridget McCusker."'29 Kirk repeated in front of two witnesses that she wanted McCusker to have the money. (Recall the similarity of the note that evi- denced the gift in Ridden v. Thrall.)130 The trial court found that Kirk had made a valid gift causa mortis, that is, in apprehension of her own death. Reversing the judgment on the facts, the majority wrote: What, then, is the inference from these repeated expressions of Margaret Kirk? That she delivered the bank books upon the contingency of her death, or in apprehension of the threat of Thomas Kirk to burn or tear down the house? That the latter was the event, and the only event, she had in mind, and in- tended to provide against, is manifest, beyond the possibility of rational dispute.131 Finding that the delivery of the bank books was made only to guard against the actions of the donor's brother, and not against her death, the court ruled that there was no intention to make a gift causa mortis.132 Two things are noteworthy in the majority opinion. First, there is the specificity of the intention the court requires: An intention to make a gift will not suffice; the donor must have an intention to make a gift under the conditions that the law recognizes. Had a general intention to give been at issue, the court need not have looked to an apprehension of death, and could have considered the gift as effective inter vivos. The question of what intent a court looks for is central to many cases. Often the question is not simply whether there was an intent to give, or even an intent to deliver, but whether there was an intent to do particular acts that the law recognizes as adequate delivery. This problematic will resur- face in other cases. The second noteworthy element is the adamance with which the court states its conclusion, putting it "beyond the possibility of rational dispute." But dispute there is, not only with the trial court whose finding of fact contradicts the majority opinion, but also with the concurrence, which is stated just as forcefully: As to the original gift, all the constituents of the donatio causa mortis are found in the detailed transaction.

The written paper, which at the time of the gift the deceased caused to be drawn up, and which she signed ... confirms the gift. The con- tingency therein expressed referred to her death. She told them that the doctor told her that the sickness would take her off at any time.133 The concurrence argues that the judgment of the trial court must be re- versed because of admission of improper testimony, but goes on to say that the case for the gift was sufficiently made out. Overall, the case is an economical illustration thatjudicial interpretation of the facts of the case, and especially the facts surrounding intention, generated wide leeway for decisionmakers, even without any conflict over the rules of valid gifts. Other cases reveal additional aspects of intention that were manipu- lable in the hands of judges. One important recurrent question was the status of joint accounts. Depositors often turned their accounts into joint accounts, sometimes with the assurances of the bank that the added ac- count holder would be entitled to survivorship-in other words, would become the sole owner of the account upon the depositor's death. Courts divided on whether such a change in the account could serve to create the right of survivorship, and thus be deemed a valid gift. The courts made this distinction based on an analysis of the depositor's intention. The case of Dunn v. Houghton, decided by the New Jersey Court of Chancery, is a good illustration because it offers one of the fullest discus- sions of the legal questions that arise in this context.134 The donor, Mary Kane, had accounts in several savings banks, two of which she changed in August, 1894, almost six years before her death, to accounts to the credit of "Mary Kane or niece Katie Pender."135 The question for the court was whether this action was sufficient to establish a valid gift.136 Noting that various courts had reached different conclusions,137 the court critiqued 133. Id. at 784 (Daly, CJ., concurring) (emphasis added) (citations omitted). 134. 51 A. 71, 75-82 (NJ. Ch. 1902). 135. Id. at 72. 136. The court dealt with three theories of how the gift might be made out: donatio causa mortis, with the crucial question being the delivery of the bank books by the donor in anticipation of her death (this theory was rejected), id. at 75-76; the effectuation of a gift by making the accounts into joint accounts (accepted), id. at 77-78; and creation of a trust (the court speculated that this would have been valid as well, but left the ruling on the footing of the valid gift), id. at 79. For the moment, I am interested only in the second theory. 137. The opinion makes mention more than once of the conflict in the case law: "The question which had given difficulty, especially in the maze of decisions in savings bank pass book cases found in our Reports, is, what is the essential form-what are the essential physical facts-which must appear in order to give effect to the donative</page><page sequence="48">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1923 other discussions of the same fact pattern for ignoring the contractual relationship among the parties.138 The court held that by contracting with the bank to provide rights to the donee, the donor had effected a valid gift, despite the fact that the enjoyment of the gift was contingent on the donor not depleting the account prior to death.139 By authorizing creation of a joint account as a method of making a valid gift, the court isolates the question of intent as a question of fact: Did the donor, at the time of adding the donee to the account, intend for the account to be a gift to the donee?140 While this may seem like a commonsense construction, it does have some counterintuitive effects. For instance, while the language is that of a completed gift, the donor retains the power to make the gift valueless, purpose?" Id. at 76. And later: "How far the foregoing views are sustained, and how far they are controverted, by decisions of courts in other jurisdictions, which we receive with great respect, I shall not endeavor to inquire. An elaborate discussion of these decisions might be of use if it were possible to reconcile them." Id. at 80. 138. Id. at 77. 139. The court distinguished between the obligation and the monetary value of the obligation: In my judgment, when a man with donative purpose converts a part of his estate into an obligation of a savings bank to another person, the discharge of which obligation may, however, contingently benefit that person, and which that person can enforce in case the contingency occurs which makes such enforcement advantageous, a case is presented of a complete gift. The external form of the gift is the absolute conversion of the donor's property into a binding obligation of a third party, the performance of which according to its terms may upon certain contingencies benefit the donee. There is nothing, however, contingent about the gift. The gift is absolute. The right is vested beyond recall in the donee. It is a matter of no consequence that the right so vested may prove in the end to be of no pecuniary value. Id. at 77-78. 140. The question of the time of the gift opens up an entire field of discussion, which I will discuss only briefly here. For some courts, the finality of the gift was essential, so that any retention of power over the object of the gift after the gift was made would be evidence that there was no gift at all; on the other hand, some courts acknowledged that a gift could be made, but its value affected by future actions of the donor. Compare Norway Sav. Bank v. Merriam, 33 A. 840, 841 (Me. 1895) (holding that "the giver must part with all present and future dominion over the property given. He cannot give it, and at the same time retain the ownership of it. ... [T]he gift must be absolute and irrevocable, without any reference to its taking effect at some future period"), with Dunn, 51 A. at 78 (holding that the contingency of the pecuniary value of the gift and the donor's power to influence it does not invalidate the gift itself, which remains absolute, despite donor's continued control). Another aspect of this problematic is that some courts favored leaving the donor maximum control during her lifetime over the gift, while others tried to fix the point of making the gift as irrevocable. Compare Cunningham v. Davenport, 41 N.E. 412, 412 (N.Y. 1895) (allowing depositor who opened account in trust for his brother to revoke the trust after the brother's death, thus leaving the depositor control over the deposit despite its form implying gift), with Kelly v. Beers, 86 N.E. 980, 983-84 (N.Y. 1909) (holding that the intent to give when the account was made into ajoint account would not be revoked by any subsequent change of view regarding the gift), and Decker v. Union Dime Sav. Inst., 44 N.Y.S. 521, 522 (App. Div. 1897) (holding that a trust, once established, is beyond the power of depositor to revoke).</page><page sequence="49">1924 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 since she retains functional control over the deposit in her lifetime. Other courts found that this feature could not be reconciled with the kind of intention they associated with a gift, and treated the same facts as leading to completely different conclusions about intention.141 The relationship between intent and the form of the deposit is com- plex. For some courts, it seems that it really is the thought that counts, and they concentrate on determining a conscious historical intention, i.e., whether the donor intended the joint account to be a gift to the person added to the account. For other courts, the very form of the ac- count is taken as an indication that there could not have been a donative intent, because such an intent requires that [the gift] should go into effect, or in other words, transfer the property, at once and completely; for, if it has reference to a future time when it is to operate as a transfer, it is nothing more than a promise without consideration, and cannot be enforced either in law or in equity.142 Often, courts remained uncommitted about what the form of the deposit entailed, leaving themselves the widest possible latitude in attributing in- tention to the original depositor.143 141. The dynamic may be seen in the following quotations: The deposit in the names of Miss O'Neill and Mrs. Whalen was payable to the order of either, or the survivor. Miss O'Neill, having by this form of entry retained undoubted power to draw the money out of bank whenever she pleased, obviously did not devest herself of dominion over it. There was nothing to prevent her from checking out every cent of the fund immediately, or at any time, after the deposit in the two names had been made. If this be true,-and it cannot be questioned,-there was no perfected gift to Mrs. Whalen, and she consequently acquired no interest in the fund by the form of the entry as it then stood. Whalen v. Milholland, 43 A. 45, 47 (Md. 1899). This particular formulation seems to put more weight on the inherent nature of ajoint deposit, while other courts often linked the issue more directly with the question of intent. This statement regarding facts similar to those in Dunn is typical: [W]e think it is clear from the nature of the transaction that [the donor] did not intend by this transfer of her deposit to the new accounts to make at that time fully executed gifts of either the legal or equitable title to the new deposits, or to part with all control over the same ... but rather that her intention was to make a testamentary disposition of these deposits, so that the persons named should each take, in case he or she survived her, what might be left of each sum after her death. Norway Sav. Bank, 33 A. at 842. The court goes on to say that such a testamentary transfer is incompatible with the statute of wills, and thus void. Id. 142. Whalen, 43 A. at 46. 143.

Summary Judges' manipulations of the test of intention in gift cases reveal a deep ambivalence with regard to gifts more generally. Thejudges appear to be searching for sufficient reasons to enforce the gift, but this search masks a more difficult and perhaps contradictory one, the search for rea- sons for giving the gift. In the search for such a cause, judges seem to rely on a logic that hopes to locate the gift within an economy of reasons. But this search, while perfectly understandable in context, undermines basic ideas about the nature of gifts. After all, if there is a gift, the donor gives it without the expectation of return and without the sense of paying off an antecedent debt. Otherwise, this giving would simply be swallowed up by the logic of exchange. The gift is, in this sense, something given for nothing, for no reason. And yet, in the context ofjudging, of enforcing, judges are inevitably drawn toward the reason for the gift. The test of intention, particularly, channels judicial inquiry toward a narrative in which a donor wants to give, in which a donor has her reasons. These reasons should not amount to the kinds of reasons the law can recognize as consideration, which would place the situation within contract, but there ought to be reasons nonetheless. But how would these reasons be articulated? What would they look like? The gift raises the specter of the subject without reason. And if the borders of the gift, and therefore of contract, are porous borders, the rationality of the contracting subject is threatened as well.144 The close reading of gift cases yields a few tentative conclusions about the workings of doctrine. First of all, the cases show that even when a rule becomes widely accepted and courts repeat a formulaic ex- pression of it, there is considerable leeway in decisionmaking. One as- pect of this leeway is that the rules retain significant exceptions, facts to which they simply do not apply. In the context of the rule on delivery, for instance, we saw that in certain situations, courts saw delivery as unneces- sary.145 But exceptions are not the main source of latitude for most rules. Instead, the greater leeway is created by the process of characterizing the facts. In a slightly different context, Professor Moglen has noted the im- portance of this phenomenon: improper evidence); Skillman v. Wiegand, 33 A. 929, 932 (NJ. Ch. 1896) (stating that intention is paramount, and finding that the intention was not to make a gift, but rather to make transactions more convenient for original depositor); Kelly, 86 N.E. at 983-84 (reversing trial court's finding of fact as to intention and noting that donor's expression of desire to give gift and her inclusion of donee's name on account proved intent "with a clearness and force beyond that required by the authorities"); In re Bolin, 32 N.E. 626, 626 (N.Y. 1892) (holdingjoint account and delivery of pass book did not show intent); McElroy v. Nat'l Sav. Bank of Albany, 40 N.Y.S. 340, 341 (App. Div. 1896) (holding account to credit of donor and donee was perfected gift, even without delivery of pass book). 144. On the challenge posed by the category of the gift to the category of reason, see generallyJacques Derrida, Given Time: I. Counterfeit Money passim, 91-92 (Peggy Kamuf trans. 1991). 145. See cases cited supra note 104 and accompanying text.</page><page sequence="51">1926 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 So far I have presented evidence that the theorist ignores at his peril the importance not of judicial law-making but judicial fact- making, or more precisely fact variation, in the adjudicatory pro- cess. The theorist needs to account-in several different con- texts-for the common law's characteristic preference for de- vices which vary the facts of individual lawsuits rather than the prospective "rules" which are said by convention to determine the outcome of disputes. The implication is that the traditional archetype of com- mon-law process is wrong in detail, because it fails to reflect the bending force which the system applies to facts.146 The issue is not predominantly a question of "fact skepticism": Even when there is agreement as to the objective acts carried out by the parties, courts are called upon to infuse the facts with meaning.147 And different courts interpret identical objective acts differently. The question arises whether there is any underlying regularity in the courts' interpretations of facts and their interaction with rules. A thor- ough investigation of the question is beyond the scope of this Article, but it may be worth engaging in a brief speculation. Judicial rhetoric in the gift cases often reveals that judges at times extended the limitation of freedom of gift to reflect their own predilections as to who should give, and especially, who should receive gifts. At times, this is nothing more than a reluctance to see the "natural" heirs disinherited.148 At other 146.

Robert Cover put the point dramatically: Just as the meaning of law is determined by our interpretive commitments, so also can many of our actions be understood only in relation to a norm. ... There is a difference between sleeping late on Sunday and refusing the sacraments, between having a snack and desecrating the fast of Yom Kippur, between banking a check and refusing to pay your income tax. In each case an act signifies something new and powerful when we understand that the act is in reference to a norm. Robert M. Cover, The Supreme Court, 1982 Term-Foreword: Nomos and Narrative, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 4, 7-8 (1983). 148. This reluctance appears even in abstract form, when it is clear from the judgment that the court has no sympathy for the particular heirs. An example is In re Wiegel's Estate, where the court went to great lengths to find a way to reverse the trial court's finding of a valid gift. 28 N.Y.S. 95, 99 (Gen. Term 1894). The motivation seems to appear when the court mentions that "we do not think a stranger to the blood of the intestate should be allowed to succeed to the entire estate upon testimony of the character which was offered to sustain his claim." Id. But the deceased was an immigrant who had lived with the plaintiff and was employed by him for twenty years, and had no known relatives in the United States. Id. at 97. The court shows no sympathy toward the deceased, and cynically states that "[t]he intestate was not in extremis when it is asserted that he made the gift, but he had ample opportunity to express his intention by a will, executed in accordance with the laws of this state." Id. at 99. At other times, the reluctance simply translates into a propensity to uphold gifts where the donee would be the heir at law in any case. See, e.g., McMath v. O'Connor, 42 N.Y.S. 1127, 1127 (App. Div. 1896) (mentioning that the transaction claimed was "a natural and reasonable one," and saying that "[i]t was natural that the testator, when he found his wife at the point of death, should have transferred his bank books to the plaintiff, his sister and only relative").</page><page sequence="52">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1927 times, courts were willing to acknowledge that the strictness of the rules could be mitigated in cases where the gift was natural, or the donee espe- cially worthy.149 For the most part, this is just a reflection ofjudges using 149. An illustration is Dennin v. Hilton, in which the donor was the plaintiff's seamstress who lived with the plaintiff and his family. 50 A. 600, 601 (NJ. Ch. 1901). The court mentions that the plaintiff had been generous with her, characterizes him as her lifelong friend, and says of her, "She was very saving. She spent nothing. She got to be ... an expert seamstress and milliner. She was a general genius." Id. at 601. Coming to a decision over whether to validate the gift, the court says: Now, is there any reason why this transaction should not stand? What could appeal more to a court of equity than this case? Is there anything in the law to prevent this woman's desires from being carried out? Is there anything disgraceful or disreputable in Capt. Hilton's accepting this gift from the woman for whom he held such an affection, and who held such affection for, and was so grateful to, him and his wife? I think not. Id. In Rix v. Hunt, the court ruled that in the case before it, possession by the donee of the notes in question was sufficient to create a presumption in favor of the gift, explaining its inclination thus: In the first place, the gift was not an unnatural act upon the part of the donor, but, upon the contrary, was just what might have been expected of a just and generous person in the same circumstances. With the exception of a brother, whose decease was in all probability but a question of a year or two at most, the plaintiff was as nearly related to Sylvester Rix as any living being. She had come to him in his old age, and had served him faithfully for nearly 10 years. There is no evidence that she ever received any compensation for the services thus rendered other than a half interest in the homestead, and the cow and notes in suit. All the other nephews and nieces of the donor were married, and living by themselves; and no reason is furnished, other than that of kinship, why they should share in the testator's bounty. 44 N.Y.S. 988, 993 (App. Div. 1897). In Reynolds v. Reynolds, the deceased had given a gift to a relative who took care of her in her last illness. 45 N.Y.S. 338, 341 (Sup. Ct. 1897). The court, rejecting the strict evidence rule generally applicable to gifts, said: "[W] hen the gift is a natural one, and the evidence is reasonable and probable, and the several steps to establish the gift causa mortis are established by a fair preponderance of evidence, the donee is entitled to the decision or verdict." Id. In Thomas v. Fuller, the donor and donee were relatives by marriage, and the court, fighting off a slight disbelief that someone might want to give a gift, wrote: We are aware that gifts are not usual among the ordinary business transactions were [sic] valuable considerations move the parties, and that they are frequently induced by sentiment or affection. A gift must be proved like any other fact .... But as we have stated, there is no conflict in the evidence .... The contention only arises as to the inferences to be drawn therefrom. The conclusion reached by the referee appears to us to be natural and logical, such as the ordinary mind would reach upon the facts. If Baker did not intend the note as a gift, what did he intend? 22 N.Y.S. 862, 864-65 (Gen. Term 1893). In In re Clark's Estate, the deceased left an estate of approximately $90,000, but in addition, his housekeeper was in possession of over $60,000, claimed by the heirs to be invalid gifts, which the court justified on the basis of her importance in his business affairs, saying: It appears that Mrs. Richardson had been his faithful housekeeper for almost a quarter of a century, taking charge of his elegant home, in which he was accustomed to entertain quite largely; and she was, no doubt, his confidential adviser in business matters, as she seems to be possessed of financial skill and ability scarcely less marked than that of her benefactor. It is easy to see how Dr.</page><page sequence="53">1928 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 their basic sense of propriety, equity, and justice when deciding whether a particular gift is valid. But this benign characterization sometimes ob- scures a darker underside, in rather predictable places where a sense of propriety, with that term's Victorian connotation, might collide with a vision of justice informed by a different sensibility.150 Clark might well have desired to reward her in a sum far exceeding simple compensation for services. 39 N.Y.S. 722, 730 (Sur. Ct. 1896). 150. Thomas' Adm'r v. Lewis offers an illustration. 15 S.E. 389, 392 (Va. 1892). The court sets out the facts in what it calls an "unavoidably long narrative of the relations, circumstances, congruities, and situation of the parties." Id. Thomas never married, but lived with a woman who had been his slave, and had two daughters by her. The elder daughter died, and the younger daughter was the claimant in the case. She lived with Thomas for over twenty years, presiding over his household and taking care of him during his illness. The court's own language in the description is worth reproducing here, though the full description is much longer: [Thomas] never married, but cohabited with a woman of half white blood, formerly his slave ... by whom he was the father of two daughters, Bettie, and an older sister, Fannie, who married and died, soon after the late civil war, without issue. Bettie, 35 years of age when her father died, and Fannie were always recognized and acknowledged by William A. Thomas as his children; they called him father, and he called them and cherished and lived with them as his children. The death of Fannie was a great grief to him; and, after that event, his whole and devoted affection was centered upon Bettie, as "daughter of his heart and house," whom he loved "passing well," and from whom he was never thereafter separated, except for the two years that he sent her to a boarding school. Id. at 390. Superstitious about making a will, he gave his entire estate to his daughter Bettie (the claimant) in the final days of an extended illness that led to his death, by delivering to her deeds to property, a bank book, promissory notes and bonds, and keys to a vault at the bank, comprising his entire estate, worth over $200,000. Id. at 389. The trial court found for the claimant, and a divided Virginia Supreme Court affirmed. Id. at 400. The differences between the majority and dissenting opinions say a great deal about how judges' predispositions can affect the characterization of the facts. The court's language merits quotation at length: There is in the record very much more testimony, equally strong, explicit, unimpeached, and uncontradicted, attesting the life-long, avowed, and unwavering solicitude and purpose of this isolated old man to nourish tenderly while he lived, and to provide for amply at his death, his devoted and faithful daughter Bettie, the only light of his long life, and the only love which quickened the emotions of his introverted and self-centered soul .... . . . [T]he avowed and constant object of Mr. Thomas' life, labor, and love was solicitude and provision for his daughter Bettie ... [T] here is not one scintilla of proof in the record that, through all the years of his life, and in all the references he ever made to his intended disposition of his property, he ever had in his heart or mind a purpose to provide particularly for any other than his cherished child, to whom he was bound by the strongest ties of nature and affection; to whom he owed the undivided obligation of a father; and whose whole tenor of life, as shown by the record in this case, from her birth to the moment of his death, was an unvarying demonstration of dutiful devotion and filial confidence and affection.</page><page sequence="54">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1929 III. THEORETICAL RESPONSES TO THE REVOLUTION IN CONSIDERATION The case law regarding gifts throws a stark light onto the workings of the classical theory of consideration, and onto classical theorizing of pri- vate law more generally. While classical scholars succeeded in formulat- ing widely accepted rules, for instance regarding the enforceability of gifts and gift promises, concrete cases with similar facts still revealed a wide range of possible solutions. This was true not only in cases lying near problematic borderlines, such as gratuitous business undertakings, but also in what theoretically should have been the easy cases, i.e., promises to make gifts. The varying solutions in concrete cases, in turn, Id. at 391-92. The majority opinion relates the testimony of friends of the deceased, showing his intention to leave everything to his daughter and nothing to his estranged distant relations, and of the eyewitness to the gift, the claimant's companion, Fannie Coles. The court characterizes Coles' testimony as "clear, consistent, convincing, and uncontradicted," and "consistent throughout ... natural, reasonable, and most probable," and mentions her "triple armor of truth" in the face of "protracted and pertinacious cross- examination." Id. at 394. The dissenting opinion rests ostensibly on a point of law regarding the applicability of a Virginia statute on gifts to the case at hand. But the dissenting judge cannot abide the trial court's determination or the majority's characterization of the facts. Instead, he describes what almost appears to be a different set of circumstances: As appears from the opinion of the majority of the court, this is a suit to enforce against the administrator of a dead man's estate an alleged gift of the whole estate, amounting to over $200,000, which alleged gift is claimed to have been made by the decedent in disregard of all of his heirs and distributees,-his next of kin,-a few minutes before his death, to a colored woman living in his house, who claims to be the result of illicit intercourse with a colored slave woman. Id. at 400 (Lacy, J., dissenting). After discussing the application of the statute to the case, the dissenting judge adds his view of the evidence, which is clearly the motivating factor in the dissent: I do not mean to concede that all that is testified to appears to me to be credible. It is an alleged gift of everything the donor possessed. This is the claim. Who was the donor? An infirm, sick man, advanced in years. At his bedside was the alleged donee, a colored married woman, acknowledged to be his child by the donor, no longer young. At her elbow, another colored woman, which latter is the sole witness to prove the gift of this large estate, who, with much detail, recites the circumstances of the gift. Id. at 404 (Lacy, J., dissenting). The dissent goes on to list circumstances supposedly inconsistent with the gift, though there is no attempt to justify suspicion of the gift through the evidence detailed by the majority. Id. Most striking here is how the racial hostility of Judge Lacy is expressed not only rhetorically but also through his recharacterization of the facts. The stark contrast between the opinions shows the obvious force of judges' predispositions influencing a decision and suggests that the same kinds of predispositions affect the decisions of jurors, trial judges, and appellate judges in more subtle ways in the plethora of cases where the relationships between donors and donees diverge from the typical. A suggestive example is De Puy v. Stevens, where the donor and donee were both women, and the donee told the donor, upon receiving the gift, "They will talk after this," and the donor replied "What do you care? You are all right." 55 N.Y.S. 810, 813 (App. Div. 1899). The court, reversing the trial court's validation of the gift, noted that other cases with similar facts recognized valid gifts upon the same acts, but distinguishes those cases by noting that the gifts there were between husband and wife. Id. at 814-15.</page><page sequence="55">1930 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 were difficult to reconcile with any single account of the justifications for the stated rules. The revolution in consideration was conceptual. Its successes on the conceptual plain, however, did not translate into straightforward changes on the level of the outcome of the cases. Thus, as we saw in the previous Part, the theoretical proposition that gifts required delivery to be valid (viewed as an extension of the principle that gratuitous promises, without more, were unenforceable) was elevated in status. Theorists assumed it to be the starting point for the discussion of gifts. And in the case law, the idea developed from a frequently heard but still contested proposi- tion before the time of the classical writers into a foundational principle of the law of gifts, repeated mantra-like, even in cases whose results un- dermined its functioning. The generation of theorists that followed the classical writers was not oblivious to the gaps between the articulations of rules and the decisions of courts. Indeed, the acute awareness of this problem was the motiva- tion for most private law theory in the postclassical period. The re- sponses generally followed one of two paths, though they had important overlapping elements. One path was to attempt the reform of existing doctrine, ranging from suggestions for direct judicial variation of doc- trine, to proposals for revising doctrine in the framework of the Restate- ment of Contracts, to ideas for legislation to correct the failures or ex- cesses of contract doctrine. The responses taking the other path were more subtle, but eventually had a deeper impact on American legal thought generally, reorienting the theoretical discussion of contract (and private law generally) away from its focus on the rules and their deriva- tions from first principles, and toward a pragmatic elaboration of policy justifications for the existing rules, or alternative ones. A. Reforming Classical Doctrine Attempts at reform of consideration doctrine are familiar, in that they have occupied much of twentieth-century discussion over contract. It would be tedious to attempt an exhaustive review here. Instead, it will suffice to mention a few of the leading efforts, and to highlight the as- pects of classical contract thinking they leave intact. With the competing goals of variety and economy in mind, it is worth considering three at- tempts at reforming the rules of consideration: one a sweeping success, one an equivocal success, and the last, an apparent failure followed by creeping partial successes. The first example revolves around the rights of third party benefi- ciaries to a contract: As the question was often phrased at the time, from whom must the consideration move? The classical statement of the rules received clear articulation in Langdell's Summary. Langdell adopted the English rule, mandating that consideration must move from the prom- isee and would create rights only between the contracting parties, as a</page><page sequence="56">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1931 necessary logical extension of the definition of consideration itself.151 The classical position was attacked on many grounds, and by the 1920's most American jurisdictions had rejected the English rule. The first Re- statement of Contracts (1932) jettisoned the original classical position, allowing what it called the "donee beneficiary" to recover in most situa- tions.152 The "striking departure ... from the English authorities"'53 was justified both by the weight of authority in American courts, and by the commercial inconvenience caused by the alternative doctrine.154 A less complete success can be seen in what became one of the most famous conflicts over the rules of contractual liability, the question of promissory estoppel. The issue has been much discussed and needs little elaboration here. It is enough to note that the classical theory of consid- eration was a restrictive theory that attempted to limit enforceability to promises explicitly bargained for. The critique of the restrictive position has been widespread and ongoing, and received official recognition in section 90 of the Restatement. The success, however, was only partial. The language of the section does not purport to make reliance into a full- fledged alternative to bargain consideration, instead relegating promis- sory estoppel situations to what one writer has called "the purgatory of 'Contracts Without Consideration.' "155 Again, the change was based on a combination of case law authority and policy argument. But even on its own terms, the section did not go as far in establishing reliance based liability as some theorists desired.156 151.

See James Baird Co. v. Gimbel Bros., Inc., 64 F.2d 344, 345-46 (2d Cir. 1933). That this was not the intention of the reporters of the Restatement is clear from the comments to the section (then section 88, to become section 90 in the official version) when it was proposed, which deal with, inter alia, promises not to foreclose mortgages, licenses to use real estate, licenses between manufacturers and distributors for the exclusive right to sell a product, gratuitous bailment, and waivers in contracts for the sale of goods.

The commentators discuss reliance based liability in a gratuitous bailment (actually a case of agency collateral to bailment), and note that the court in one case quoted Professor Parsons: "If a person makes a gratuitous promise, and then enters upon the performance of it, he is held to a full execution of all he has undertaken."

The rule covered several issues ranging from the mutuality of obligation, to the validity of illusory promises, to the validity of modifications of existing contractual relations. Critics charged that the rule, while often declared by the courts, was not required by the logic of contracts and that when applied, it more often caused mischief than solved problems.157 Initially, the voice of the contract establishment dug in its heels with respect to the rule on mutuality.158 Over the course of continue: "This quotation from Professor Parsons goes far beyond Section 88 [later ? 90], and if literally taken goes beyond anything that can be accepted."

Commentaries provide an explanation in context: One of the advisers, Professor Oliphant, questions the soundness of Section 78 [? 80 in the official version]. He is of the opinion that there is no logical foundation for the rule there stated. He regards the decisions on voidable promises not as exceptions to the rule, Section 78, but as a contradiction of it.... To the other advisers the rule stated in Section 78 seems unquestionable law; and the Reporter has expressed his opinion not only to this effect but also to the point that the rule is a necessary logical consequence of the idea that value must be given in exchange for a promise-an idea which lies at the root of the whole doctrine of consideration.</page><page sequence="58">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1933 the century, reformers managed to chip away at the rule piecemeal, though it is still nominally an accepted part of contract doctrine.159 These attempts at reform of consideration doctrine are representa- tive of the dozens that have constituted the history of the doctrine in the twentieth century. The major milestones are Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, each of which relaxed the doctrine in several areas of application.160 But just as important as the changes these reforms have brought to contract is what they have left unchallenged. With very few exceptions, the focus has been expanding and securing promissory liability. Even the proponents of reliance have generally been concerned with reliance on promises, rather than, say, duties arising out of relationships.161 Indeed, the calls for re- form of consideration doctrine, and even of contract more generally, are so often phrased in terms of the expansion of promissory liability that it becomes difficult to imagine any other source of liability in contract. In that sense, the reforms of consideration doctrine become part of the en- trenchment of the most important aspect of the classical revolution, which was to center contractual liability around promise. B. Reorienting Theory: From Rules toJustifications Despite popular caricatures of Christopher Columbus Langdell, there was never a time, even at the height of classical legal theory, when theorists were concerned exclusively with the logical derivations of legal rules and completely indifferent to the social justifications of rules and A.L.I., Commentaries No. 2, supra note 155, at 8. 159. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts ? 73 (1981). In an assessment of the decline of the rule, Professor Eisenberg writes: The modern emergence of the doctrine of unconscionability has stripped the legal-duty rule of what little justification it once had. Even courts that believe themselves obliged to follow the rule characterize it as "technical," regard it with "disfavor," and find it to be supported by "neither rhyme nor reason." The rule has been riddled with inconsistent exceptions, repudiated by judicial decisions in several states, repudiated as to contracts for the sale of goods by the Uniform Commercial Code, and effectively repudiated as to written contracts by statutes in several major jurisdictions. The time has come to drop the legal-duty rule and substitute in its place a careful review of bargains involving the performance of a preexisting contractual duty, to determine whether they are unconscionable.

Whether we adopt Felix Cohen's pejorative label of "transcendental non- sense"163 to describe classical legal academics' work or use Cardozo's more neutral reference to the "method of philosophy" and the "method of history"164 is not critical. Whatever label we use to describe it, the im- portant thing for my purposes is to note that the dominant mode of legal academic writing in the classical period concentrated heavily on detailed elaboration of the rules, and heightened attention to the problems of consistency among them. The preferred method for ensuring consis- tency was to erect strict boundaries between different fields, like contract, tort, and quasi-contract, and to attempt to have the rules flow from a small number of first principles, which had a definitional quality.'65 From the first decades of the twentieth century, and with increasing momentum through the 1940's, the style of legal reasoning employed in the academy shifted. Again, it makes little difference whether we adopt Cohen's "functional approach,"166 Cardozo's "method of sociology,"167 Pound's "sociological jurisprudence,"168 or "legal realism" to describe the new style. The important thing is to recognize that the focus of academic attention shifted from elaboration of and argumentation over the formu- lation of the rules themselves to the elaboration of pragmatic policy justi- fications, either for existing rules or for their alternatives. At certain points, there was almost no inclination to support any particular rule choice: The entire focus was on working out the underlying objectives and justifications of rules generally. The idea was that laying bare the objectives that rules could serve would allow judges to engage in more conscious and better informed decisionmaking, with the goal of social welfare never far from the forefront. The most influential example of this style of work in the field of con- sideration theory is Lon Fuller's Consideration and Form.169 In that article, 162.

Fuller's real contribution was to conduct the same kind of tradeoff analysis with regard to the substantive societal func- tions of the doctrine.172 However, a functional analysis of the role of the formality of delivery in gifts, by Philip Mechem, had appeared fifteen years earlier.173 Mechem's article is characterized by a combination of approaches. On the one hand, he articulates the reasons for the require- ment of formality of delivery: It alerts the donor to the seriousness of the action-thus reducing the danger of non-deliberative gift giving-and it affords prima facie evidence of the transaction having occurred in fact.174 On the other hand, Mechem devotes nearly one hundred pages of analy- sis to specific types of gift transfers, and to the operation of the rules of delivery regarding each one.175 In the same year that Consideration and Form appeared, Ashbel Gul- liver, the Dean of Yale Law School, co-authored, with his research assis- tant Catherine Tilson, a landmark article entitled Classification of Gratui- tous Transfers.176 That article went beyond Mechem's functional analysis in the same way that Fuller had gone beyond the question of considera- tion as a formality. The conceptual starting point for Gulliver and Til- son's article is the indeterminacy of the rules regarding gifts. For in- stance, regarding the rules that distinguish inter vivos from testamentary transfers, they write: "In numerous cases, therefore, the validity of an attempted disposition is dependent on its being classified as inter vivos rather than testamentary. The doctrinal test supposed to determine this choice is extremely flexible and can be manipulated almost at will by the courts."177 With the inadequacy of the rules in mind, the authors raise 170.

Following the usual philosophical description, the transfer is said to be inter vivos if an interest passes during the lifetime of the transferor, but</page><page sequence="61">1936 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 the level of abstraction, detailing functions the rules should perform.178 And the functions, in turn, are to be interpreted in light of the overriding objective governing this aspect of the law: One fundamental proposition is that, under a legal system recognizing the individualistic institution of private property and granting to the owner the power to determine his succes- sors in ownership, the general philosophy of the courts should favor giving effect to an intentional exercise of that power. This is commonplace enough, but it needs constant emphasis, for it may be obscured or neglected in inordinate preoccupation with detail or dialectic. A court absorbed in purely doctrinal argu- ments may lose sight of the important and desirable objective of sanctioning what the transferor wanted to do, even though it is convinced that he wanted to do it.179 The contribution of Gulliver and Tilson's article lies primarily in the way the discussion of rules is given an explicit context. By foregrounding the seemingly obvious but often unmentioned overriding goal of respecting individual intent in the disposition of property, the authors provide the background against which the rules can be developed, interpreted, and applied. Fuller and Gulliver were part of a wave of scholarship that presented a twofold challenge to classical contract theory: First, it showed that even widely accepted rules gave judges too much latitude to afford certainty, implying that the attention lavished on the elaboration of rules by the classics was misplaced; and second, it articulated underlying reasons that would justify the rules (or alternatives to them), in the hope that such underlyingjustifications could better orient the interpretation and appli- testamentary if no interest passes until at or after his death. But the postulated "interest" is entirely abstract in character. It has no necessary relationship to the physical possession or economic enjoyment of the property, since a right to future possession and enjoyment may be, and frequently is, held to be a present interest.... [T]he test is not per se determinative in the more marginal cases. It has achieved respectability as the verbal clothing of the result; but the compelling precedent will be the actual decision on similar facts, not judicial reiteration of this vague and abstract criterion. Id. 178. They suggest that the requirement of formality in gratuitous transfers serves three functions: the "ritual function," geared toward impressing the transferor with the significance of the act and justifying the conclusion that the acts were deliberately intended to be operative; the "evidentiary function," geared toward ensuring the reliability of the proof of the gift; and the "protective function," safeguarding against undue influence or other forms of imposition. Id. at 3-5. 179. Id. at 2. Again, the continuation is pertinent: If this objective is primary, the requirements of execution, which concern only the form of the transfer-what the transferor or others must do to make it legally effective-seem justifiable only as implements for its accomplishment, and should be so interpreted by the courts in these cases. They surely should not be revered as ends in themselves, enthroning formality over frustrated intent.

When looking for the un- derlying justification for the doctrine, the purpose served by considera- tion could be viewed in a number of ways: The most influential way was as a test of when it is useful for the legal system to intervene in disputes, raising the question of whether the interaction between the parties is "productive" and therefore worthy of the effort of enforcement.183 The critique of this view is primarily that it relies on a false intuition that gra- tuitous promises are unproductive, whereas in fact there is nothing to support such an intuition and much to refute it.184 180. For examples, see infra note 209. 181. See, e.g., Benjamin F. Boyer, Promissory Estoppel: Principle from Precedents (pts. 1 &amp; 2), 50 Mich. L.

Monahan, Note, Gratuitous Undertakings: Liability of Promisor for Nonfeasance, 9 Cornell L.Q. 54, 54-57 (1923) (supporting recovery for damage arising from nonfeasance by a gratuitous undertaker). 182. Boyer's articles on promissory estoppel are illustrative. On the one hand, he draws some of his most important examples from cases of gratuitous bailment and from issues of waiver and related relinquishing of rights. Boyer, Principle from Precedents (pt. 1), supra note 181, at 644. These examples could have generated the attempt to formulate a theory of liability based on a working relationship (however that relationship comes about), rather than on what is often a fictional element in them, promise. However, the entire framework for discussion is centered on promises, and on affording enforcement to promises that are not simply bargain transactions. Id. at 643; see also Shattuck, supra note 181, at 909-14 (arguing that conceptual boundaries obscure the fact that some gratuitous promises are enforced, but neglecting the possibility that liability might be based on something other than promise). For hints (but little more than hints) that liability in contract may at times be based on something other than promise, see Llewellyn, Complexity of Consideration, supra note 46, at 778-79. 183. Fuller is often cited for this proposition and its economic resonance. The passage alluded to is his citation, in Consideration and Form, of Bufnoir: "While an exchange of goods is a transaction which conduces to the production of wealth and the division of labor, a gift is, in Bufnoir's words, a 'sterile transmission.'"

This strain of thinking was championed by Llewellyn, and explains why he concen- trated on the elements of consideration doctrine that are most directly related to preventing duress or unfair advantage, particularly in situations involving the modification of ongoing relationships.185 The weakness (and perhaps the interesting part) of this view is that it runs counter to one of the basic components of consideration theory-the rule that ade- quacy of consideration is not to be evaluated. This rule seems to imply that consideration doctrine is not to be used to police the fairness of exchange, and indeed that anything that crosses the threshold of ex- change is presumptively free from examination as to fairness. Considera- tion, then, "be it never so small," is precisely the factor that allows a par- ticular exchange to escape scrutiny.186 This seeming contradiction is not fatal, either to the doctrine or to the view that consideration is about ensuring fairness. It does, however, require an acknowledgment of the gratuitous promises); Simpson, supra note 81, at 34-35 (noting the importance of gifts as a mode of transferring wealth). 185. In his Foreword to a symposium on consideration, Llewellyn wrote: No man can follow either the 'equivalency' phases or the 'bargain' aspects down into their meaning, without tangling with the line which runs from duress through undue inequality of bargaining position on into too great inequality of what seems to have been intended as a bargain and not as a gift ....

Rev. 863, 871-75 (1941) (arguing that various uses of consideration doctrine are technical means of preserving fairness, and that explicit recognition of the principle would improve theory and help guide courts); Karl N. Llewellyn, What Price Contract?-An Essay in Perspective, 40 Yale L.J. 704, 741-44 (1941) (discussing the difficulties of consideration, particularly in reference to modification of agreements and the tendency of the doctrine to develop in the direction of relieving weaker bargainers). A recent provocative account of the history of contract has taken these kinds of claims further, arguing that most of the important doctrines within the field of contract are actually means to examine the distribution of wealth among the contracting parties, and in effect to ensure an equitable distribution. See James Gordley, Enforcing Promises, 83 Cal. L. Rev. 547, 613-14 (1995). 186. See 1 Williston 1st ed., supra note 25, ? 115 (quoting Sturlyn v. Albany, Cro. Eliz. 67). Williston's discussion of the adequacy of consideration is telling, because it at first upholds the doctrine, but then discusses many cases where the distinction between an examination of adequacy and an examination of the very presence of a bargain is hard to uphold: Sometimes a consideration of one dollar or other small sum is paid or alleged to have been paid in return for a promise to give or do something of considerable value. There seems no reason to depart in such a case from the general rule that adequacy of consideration will not be regarded, though an inquiry whether the dollar was really bargained for as the consideration, will always be pertinent; for where a promise of value is stated to have been made for a small money consideration, there is often reason to doubt whether a bargain to exchange the sum mentioned for the promise was really intended by the parties.

They assume that the question for which consideration offers the answer is, which promises should the law enforce? But when the historical view is added, we can see that one purpose of consideration, as we know it, is to install the question of promise (and enforceable promise) as the center of contract. IV. CURRENT SCHOLARSHIP ON GIFTS AND CONSIDERATION A. The Debate over Societal Implications of Doctrine Articles like Fuller's and Gulliver and Tilson's form the theoretical backdrop to the surge in writing on gifts and consideration over the last decade.188 The latest writing on gifts makes a significant shift from the style of writing, reaching its peak in the 1940s, that concentrated on the functional justification of the rules. The change is characterized by shift- ing the weight of the discussion from the relatively narrow policyjustifica- tion of the requirements of formality to the broader societal implications 187. In his symposium introduction, Llewellyn wrote: What all this comes to, is that "the field" [of consideration] is bound, for a while, to mean different things to every man who tries to get under its surface. It is no wonder that philosophers exploring it have been unable to find any single policy-theory on which "the" doctrine rested. There is more wonder that there has not come a more adequately emphatic recognition that this is not for one reason, but for two. It is not only because "consideration" expresses a considerable number of policies, often at odds and not worked out into full harmony. It is, even more, because there is no single doctrine or body of doctrine to be found either under or near the label. Llewellyn, Complexity of Consideration, supra note 46, at 779. 188.

My argument in this Part will be that despite the inclination to consider the societal implica- tions of the law of gifts and consideration, most of the current scholar- ship misses its larger significance because of the way the very distinction between enforceable and unenforceable promises limits vision of the wider context. Two contributions to the literature deserve special attention here be- cause of their importance in framing the current discussion over gifts and consideration. The first is Jane Baron's Gifts, Bargains, and Form, pub- lished in 1989. Baron's article sets out to challenge the doctrines that posit additional formal requirements to the enforceability of gifts, as op- posed to bargains, and then to challenge the dominance of the valuation of exchange at the expense of recognizing the worth of gifts and noncommodity capital more generally.189 The attack on the require- ments comes from several angles. On the one hand, Baron questions the historical pedigree of the functional justification of the requirements, suggesting that the justifications are products of the early twentieth cen- tury.190 She goes on to question the assumptions that animate those justi- fications, and, relying on social science evidence, argues that "the func- tionalist account is simplistic and misleading."191 With these critiques of the formal bases for denying enforcement to gifts in place, Baron turns to the substantive distinction between gifts and bargains, arguing that the distinction is not sound, and that in any case there is reason to reject the conception of gifts as inherently unimportant.192 She concludes by com- bining the various channels of attack and making a case for the abandon- ment of formal requirements for the enforcement of gift promises.193 189. Baron, supra note 82, at 198-201. Drawing on Margaret Radin, Baron writes: [I]t is not entirely clear why the expectations of gift-exchange should be any less important for being non-economic. Wealth consists of more than commodities. Objects can be valuable not just as means of producing additional material rewards but because "they are part of the way we constitute ourselves as continuing personal entities in the world."

Her conclusion is worth quotation at some length: [T]here is a case to be made for abandoning the formal rules that presently govern donative transfers. They do not come to us new; they come freighted with a baggage of justification that may prevent us from according to gifts the social and emotional significance non-lawyers have seen in them. They are associated, ideologically, with questionable distinctions between giving and bargaining and equally questionable assumptions about how individuals do or ought to behave in either variety of exchange. Whether we can retain the rules without also retaining the distinctions and assumptions that have grown up around them is an open question; until it is resolved, there is something to be said for abandoning them all.</page><page sequence="66">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1941 An interesting and rather direct contrast to Baron's article is Melvin Eisenberg's 1997 article, The World of Contract and the World of Gft.194 Ei- senberg revisits his first attempt to justify the donative promise princi- ple,195 reaching a similar normative conclusion for significantly different reasons. If at first Eisenberg favored nonenforcement of donative promises for essentially negative reasons (i.e., that the legal system was not well equipped to deal with the problems they raised, especially ques- tions of proof and deliberativeness), his recent discussion proposes a pos- itive, if counterintuitive, explanation: Our social world is richer, accord- ing to Eisenberg, when donative promises remain outside the scope of legal intervention. He writes: The world of gift is a world of our better selves, in which affec- tive values like love, friendship, affection, gratitude, and com- radeship are the prime motivating forces. These values are too important to be enforced by law and would be undermined if the enforcement of simple, affective donative promises were to be mandated by the law. It is just because these values are usu- ally missing from the more impoverished world of contract that the law must play a central role in that world.'96 Eisenberg reaches this conclusion by presenting the world of contract as one driven by alienated and impersonal values, reducible for the most One thing is certain. The goals of the law of donative transfers are far less clear than they are often made to appear. The law is outwardly committed to the effectuation of individual intent with respect to gifts as well as contracts. Yet it appears to value market exchanges, which are perceived to create wealth, over gifts, which are perceived merely to redistribute wealth. The law's relatively low regard for gifts makes it difficult to carry out its commitment to them. Given this confusion, it is not surprising that, despite its ostensible commitment to gifts, the law adopts intent-defeating requirements for donative transfers. Id. at 202-03. 194. Eisenberg, World of Contract, supra note 35. 195. In Donative Promises, published in 1979, Eisenberg argued that while there are substantive reasons for enforcing simple donative promises, the principle of nonenforcement is justified because the process-based problems of enforcement (problems of proof and deliberativeness) outweigh the substantive advantages. Eisenberg, Donative Promises, supra note 188, at 2-6. 196. Eisenberg, World of Contract, supra note 35, at 849. This view is a direct contrast to Baron's account, which on the same issues offers the following complaint: The conventional understanding of consideration helps create a dichotomy between gifts and bargains by treating them as transfers that are different both in kind and in importance. It teaches that because gift transfers are socially uncommon and economically insignificant, they warrant less legal attention than bargains.... When the accounts of the functions of consideration and of form are combined, they send a single message. Gifts are marginal. Socially uncommon, economically unimportant, morally unworthy, gifts can claim little on their own behalf. The weakness of their claim justifies the law in treating them with only the greatest reluctance and suspicion. Baron, supra note 82, at 188-89.</page><page sequence="67">1942 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 part to commodities and prices. The world of gift, on the other hand, characterized by affective considerations, should be protected from com- modification.197 The counterintuitive aspect of Eisenberg's position is that he sets out to protect the world of gift, arguing that such protection must come not by direct enforcement of its values, but rather through nonenforcement of transactions in the gift world, which can then remain pure of the alienated forces of legal intervention. The roots of such a position are already present, as an undeveloped kernel, in Fuller's Consideration and Form.198 After discussing reasons for imposing liability and mentioning the costs of enforcement, Fuller moves on to consider a "less tangible" cost: "There is a real need for a field of human intercourse freed from legal restraints, for a field where men may without liability withdraw assurances they have once given. Every time a new type of promise is made enforceable, we reduce the area of this field."199 But Eisenberg develops the insight into a far-reaching positive principle. The legal enforcement of contracts has an impoverishing, alienating element, and some parts of human intercourse should remain shielded from its negative influence.200 At this point, we can compare directly Eisenberg's and Baron's ac- counts of the implications of the law of donative transfers. Both Eisen- berg and Baron are concerned about the role of law in commodifying society.201 But their views of how commodification happens are opposed: 197. Eisenberg follows Margeret Radin in his use of the term. See Eisenberg, World of Contract, supra note 35, at 847-48 (quoting at length from Margaret Jane Radin, Market-Inalienability, 100 Harv. L. Rev. 1849, 1907-08 (1987)). 198. Fuller, supra note 169, at 813. 199. Id. (footnote omitted). Fuller asserts that this need is "not merely spiritual" but also necessary to encourage commerce. Id. Thus, his idea is not based on a division into the world of gift and the world of contract, but more generally into realms of enforceability (possible coercion) and nonenforceability (freedom). According to Fuller, the flexibility of nonenforceability in the negotiation stage can serve as encouragement for people to enter into binding business relationships. Id. 200. See Eisenberg, World of Contract, supra note 35, at 848. Eisenberg elaborates: [M]aking simple, affective donative promises enforceable would have the effect of commodifying the gift relationship. Under an enforceability regime, it could never be clear to the promisee, or even to the promisor, whether a donative promise that was made in a spirit of love, friendship, affection, or the like, was also performed for those reasons, or instead was performed to discharge a legal obligation or avoid a lawsuit.... In short, legal enforcement of simple, affective donative promises would move the commodity rather than the relationship to the forefront, would essentially convert the gift promise into a cash equivalent, and would submerge the affective relationship that the gift was intended to totemize. Id. 201. This concern distinguishes them from some theorists of gifts, notably those devoted to economic analysis, for whom a reduction to the commodified aspects of gift giving offers a powerful heuristic mechanism with which to evaluate legal rules. See, e.g., Eric Posner, supra note 188, at 568 (arguing that law and economics provides a more promising methodology for investigating law than law and sociology); see also Kull, supra note 184, at 50-51, 59-64 (arguing that gratuitous promises have sufficient social utility to</page><page sequence="68">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1943 Baron views the legal system as valorizing contractual wealth production at the expense of gifts, viewed by the system as nonproductive. According to Baron's account, disparaging gifts is part of a process through which commodities come to be viewed as the only form of wealth.202 Eisenberg, on the other hand, views legal intervention and the threat of intervention as commodifying agents. Thus, he concludes that to the extent that gifts can be protected from interaction with the mechanisms of legal enforce- ment, they preserve a sphere untouched by the commodified values that reign in the realm of contract.203 Baron's and Eisenberg's positions on the question of commodification are representative of the current schol- arly debate over gifts. Baron and Eisenberg agree on the goal: to reduce or at least limit the spread of commodification. They also agree that the crucial question for the law in this regard is where the line between en- forceable and nonenforceable promises will be drawn. They disagree pri- marily about where to draw that line.204 B. The Limitations of the Current Debate An analogous division characterizes most of the scholarly debate. While the writing on gifts is diverse, it shares a basic structure with the contributions made by Baron and Eisenberg. A range of normative con- cerns is presented as riding on the drawing of lines between enforceable and nonenforceable promises.205 The most common normative theme merit enforcement, without explicitly using economic analysis methodology). Much of the current literature on gifts shares some concern about commodification. See, e.g., Leslie, supra note 188, at 624-27 (critiquing both Eisenberg's and Posner's arguments against enforcement of gratuitous promises made within the context of interpersonal relationships); Rose, Giving, Trading, supra note 116, at 312-17 (asserting that exchange systems could never have been started without an element of gift preceding exchange relations, and that contract law permits parties to make that initial gift "with confidence at the outset of exchange relations"); Schroeder, supra note 188, at 883-98 (discussing common misperceptions as to the role of commodification in interrelationships). 202. Baron, supra note 82, at 158. 203. Eisenberg, World of Contract, supra note 35, at 847-49. 204. Eisenberg sums up the centrality of the question: As contract law moves toward enforcing all commercial promises, even those that appear gratuitous, the major issue raised by the doctrine of consideration becomes whether and to what extent gratuitous noncommercial promises- donative promises-should be enforced. Accordingly, just as in classical contract law the basic fault line in consideration ran at the boundary between bargain promises and gratuitous promises, so in modern contract law the basic fault line in consideration runs at the boundary between commercial promises and donative promises. Id. at 833. 205. The structure could be played out among various pairs (or larger groups) of scholars. An example from the most recent writing on gifts (two articles that appeared in 1999) would be a comparison between Leslie, supra note 188, and Schroeder, supra note 188. Both are interested in nurturing healthy relationships among individuals, and see enforcement of promises as a central locus of legal involvement in such a process. They differ because of what they believe about relationships: Schroeder argues that gift relations are based on domination and a lack of recognition of equality and so should be</page><page sequence="69">1944 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 recurring in the gift literature is the enhancement of autonomy that more liberal promise enforcement would afford,206 but other concerns range from economically measured welfare207 all the way to (believe it or not) love.208 Thus, the common theme of the current literature on gifts is the attempt to effect changes in the social world by changing doctrine, or more specifically, by adjusting the level of enforceability of promises. viewed with suspicion by the law. Id. at 870. Leslie, on the other hand, argues that like contracts, gifts are (often) part of a set of working relationships implying a great deal of unbargained-for reciprocity, and in such cases should be accorded legal protection. Leslie, supra note 188, at 553-55. Neither Schroeder nor Leslie is primarily interested in incentives, but their analyses imply that legal rules send messages that have societal implications for the development of relationships. An analogous contrast could be played out between Kull, supra note 184, and Eric Posner, supra note 188: Both are interested in overall welfare, a part of which is the autonomy of the actors. Posner argues that overall welfare is enhanced by rules that limit enforceability of certain gratuitous promises, Eric Posner, supra note 188, at 608, while Kull reaches the opposite conclusion, primarily because his view of welfare is linked more tightly with respect for autonomy conceived as the freedom to make bad choices, Kull, supra note 184, at 61. 206. See, e.g., Baron, supra note 82, at 202 ("The law is outwardly committed to the effectuation of individual intent with respect to gifts as well as contracts. . . . The law's relatively low regard for gifts makes it difficult to carry out its commitment to them."); see also id. at 158-61 (arguing that the use of intent-defeating formalities in an area of law ostensibly committed to the effectuation of intent expresses an underlying ambivalence about the value of gifts); Farnsworth, supra note 188, at 366-72 (arguing that expansions of enforcement of gratuitous promises are based on a relaxation of paternalism in traditional rules of consideration, and that relaxing paternalism expands the application of the intention principle); Kull, supra note 184, at 51 ("[I]t is the values associated with private autonomy-the presumptive desirability of rules enabling individuals to make secure arrangements within the scope of social affairs left to voluntary action-that form the heart of the affirmative case for enforcing gratuitous promises."). 207. Compare, e.g., Eric Posner, supra note 188, at 608-09 (proposing a hierarchy of enforceability based on social utility of different kinds of promises, and arguing that courts should not routinely enforce gratuitous promises), with Kull, supra note 184, at 55-58 (proposing that enforceability of gratuitous promises will enhance the net social gain from beneficial reliance). 208. Schroeder, supra note 188, at 870 (arguing that law's limited recognition of gratuitous promises is justified because "gift does not merely compare unfavorably with contract in accomplishing the goal of mutual recognition and freedom, it can actually be destructive of this goal-causing domination and restriction"). Schroeder elaborates: [I]nsofar as contract creates a minimal degree of recognizability and equality between subjects, it creates the minimum conditions for the achievement of more satisfying relationships such as the loving relationship sometimes achieved in the modern companionable family characterized by particular altruism, and the loyal relationship of citizenship sometimes achieved in the modern constitutional state characterized by universal altruism. Both of these institutions are based on equality.... The imperfect mutuality and equality of contract is an imperfect step in this process. Gift, in contrast, is not merely the failure to achieve perfect mutuality and equality in practice, it is one-sided and hierarchical by its very nature. Consequently, insofar as the modern rule of law in the constitutional state is based on an ideal of equality and autonomy, there is an inherent logic in the law's privileging of contractual relations and suspicion of gift. Id. at 903; see also id. at 870-73 (depicting, in a section titled "Contract as Love," the meeting of the minds in a contract of equals as a "moment of love").</page><page sequence="70">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1945 This common theme should be contrasted with the earlier work on gifts and consideration. For classical thinkers, the task was simply to make doctrine out of what was perceived to be a relatively disorganized mass of often conflicting precedents. For functionalist scholars, the goal was to change doctrine by clarifying its underlying justifications, while the result- ing changes in the social world were left for the most part implicit. For the current generation of gift-consideration theorists, the direct focus is the impact in the social world that changes in doctrine should have. The first problem with this attitude of current scholarship is that it exaggerates the potential impact of legal doctrine, and the directness of that impact. In fact, the impact of doctrine is questionable even in its purported field of application: appellate adjudication. Over the course of the century, attempts to evaluate doctrine through a close reading of case law have revealed that the rules emerge riddled with exceptions that threaten to swallow the rules themselves.209 Moreover, even when the rules themselves are left unchallenged, they leave judges wide latitude to decide cases according to an ad hoc sense of justice and propriety.210 Further, the specific character of gift litigation shows that the typical play- ers, nearly all one-shot litigants, are particularly resistant to including le- gal rules in their incentive structure.211 I do not mean that doctrine has no impact anywhere. I do want to suggest, however, that the impact of a 209. For some of the leading examples of such analyses, see, e.g., Arthur L. Corbin, Offer and Acceptance, and Some of the Resulting Legal Relations, 26 Yale LJ. 169, 173-78 (1917) (discussing exceptions to the rule that a contract must be binding on both parties or be binding on neither); Pound, supra note 50, at 668-70 (discussing exceptions to rule against enforcement of "voluntary," i.e., gratuitous, contracts); George P. Costigan, Jr., Implied-in-Fact Contracts and Mutual Assent, 33 Harv. L. Rev. 376, 381-95 (1920) (discussing many types of implied contracts and eventually acknowledging that there are still other possibilities); Walter Wheeler Cook, The Present Status of the "Lack of Mutuality" Rule, 36 Yale LJ. 897, 902-03 (1927) (listing eight exceptions to the rule requiring that to be enforceable, contracts must have been mutually enforceable at some point in the past); Fuller &amp; Perdue, supra note 35 (pt. 1), at 73 ("In distinguishing between the reliance and the expectation interests we encounter not so much a shifting line of division as a miscellaneous group of cases which seem equally happy in either category."); K.N. Llewellyn, On Our Case-Law of Contract: Offer and Acceptance (pt. 1), 48 Yale LJ. 1, 1 (1938) (suggesting that theory of contract formation had been "overwhelmed by its own qualifications"); Boyer, Principle from Precedents, supra note 181, at 494-95 (summarizing conditions under which promissory estoppel has been applied); Farber &amp; Matheson, supra note 156, at 907-24 (suggesting that, contrary to received wisdom, reliance is not the key to understanding promissory estoppel doctrine); Leslie, supra note 188, at 591 ("Academics view the undue influence doctrine [of wills] as the judicial equivalent of silly putty."). Many of the analyses in this style have proposed new groupings of the cases in order to offer alternative justifications that would rationalize the decisions. With some level of predictability, however, most of the alternative justifications would probably be just as susceptible to the kind of exposure to contradiction the analysts engaged in with regard to the initial rule structure. 210. This is the heavy-handed lesson of Part II, supra. 211. I do not mean to suggest that this is a willful position. It is simply that potential gift litigants are unlikely to consider legal rules when structuring their relationships. Melanie Leslie explains:</page><page sequence="71">1946 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 particular rule is less direct than assumed in the literature. The theoreti- cal discussion over where to draw the line between enforceable and unen- forceable promises has never directly governed the decision in the cases where it was relevant. Even if it did, most of the potential litigants are not in touch with the system to the extent that the decisions would affect behavior ex ante, making concerns (about either commodification or utility) seem misplaced. Participants in the current debate over gifts have too much in com- mon with the boy searching for a lost coin in the light of a street lamp. When asked, the boy acknowledges that he dropped the coin a few yards away, but that it still makes sense to search under the lamp, because the light is better there. So it is with the debate over the enforceability of donative promises. The participants acknowledge the malleability of the rules, but persist in looking for the social impact of doctrine as an exten- sion of the rules themselves. The impact, like the coin, exists, but the theorists are looking for it too close at hand. And yet, paradoxically, perhaps they are also looking too far away. The scholars involved in the debate focus on explicit normative prescrip- tions, which eventually are to be adopted or rejected by a lawmaker. The lawmaker, in turn, is supposed to evaluate the justification proposed by the theorist, and, if it is persuasive, act on it. What the theorists seem to ignore is the impact of the shape of the debate itself. In other words, by concentrating on the debate's conclusions, in the form of a set of norma- tive prescriptions, scholars tend to efface the possible impact of the bulk of their own activity-the process of argumentation over the rules, justifi- cations, and fact situations relevant to a particular problem. In fact, the initial characterization of the problem is one of the most significant as- pects of the endeavor. In this respect, scholars whose "positions" cover the entire spectrum of current gift-consideration theory are actually united in a common project. Whether they support enforcement or re- ject enforcement, attempt to combat commodification or see it as the basis of rationality, they are joined by the structure of the discourse, which revolves around the question of whether donative promises should be enforced.212 Even if courts consciously attempted to encourage reliance by family members, their efforts would have little effect because family members are even less likely than commercial actors to consult statutes and judicial decisions in shaping their relationships with parents, children, and spouses. Accordingly, many of the insights contained in recent scholarship on gratuitous promises are inapplicable to promises made in the family realm because these insights rely on the assumption that the particular legal rule will influence whether and to what extent family members will make implicit arrangements and whether to honor the implied terms of those agreements. Leslie, supra note 188, at 619-20. 212. More generally, this is the question of where the line between enforceable and unenforceable promises should be drawn. This is precisely the question that classical</page><page sequence="72">2001 ] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1947 In what follows, then, I will try to assess the impact of the frame of the debate. Before doing so, however, it is worthwhile to take a slightly broader view of the context. Over the course of the century, the focus of debates over consideration seems to have shifted significantly, from the elaboration of the rules themselves, to the underlying justifications for the rules, and on to the social significance of a preference for some justi- fications and some rules over others. But despite these shifts, a deeper similarity persists, and in fact characterizes the entire modern discussion of consideration. That similarity lies in the retention of the central ani- mating question: What promises should the law enforce? In the long view, a century of discussion about consideration can be seen as the crea- tion and maintenance of a rhetoric, one of whose effects is to shape the way lawyers envision problems of obligation among people in relationships. V. RECAPITULATION AND SPECULATION Thus far, I have argued that the current scholarly debate over gifts and consideration is a direct outgrowth of the classical revolution in con- tract thinking. Classical theorists placed promise at the center of their vision of contract, replacing a conception of contract that relied heavily on patterns of typical relationships, the content of which was societally imposed. Generations of contract scholars since the classical theorists (realists and functionalists from the thirties onwards, and modern schol- ars over the last twenty years) successfully challenged the classical formu- lation of the rules, and have effected a major shift in the acceptable style of justification of those rules. However, they left the framework for the discussion intact: For the past hundred years, the question of considera- tion has been concerned with which promises the law should enforce, and the current debate on gifts has not challenged that. At the same time, the various answers proposed by theorists to this question do not actually determine the outcomes of many cases. My contention is that the real effects of the debate over gifts and consideration are doubly dis- placed: First, they stem not from the various answers different theorists have proposed, but rather from the framework of the debate itself, or, if you will, from the question; second, they are not felt on the plane of the formation of contracts, where the rules ostensibly apply. In order to assess the implications of contract theory centered around promise and consideration, it will be useful to expand briefly on the possible meaning of the theoretical shift for the classical scholars who pioneered it. Their vision of contract may be contrasted to several other ideas through which the obligations of relationship could be regulated or managed, which can be characterized as parallel tracks of distinguishing contract from other forms of regulation. The first of these parallel tracks contract theorists managed to place at the center of their new conception of contract at the end of the nineteenth century. See supra Part I.</page><page sequence="73">1948 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 is the distinction between contract and status; the second, between a con- tract economy and an economy of gift exchange; and the third, between a system of regulation concentrating on the formation of obligation and one concentrating on its contents. Each of these deserves some attention. A. Contract Versus Status On one level, defining contract around promise accomplished a fun- damental goal of distinguishing contract from status. As long as contract was viewed as the law governing more or less standardized relationships whose contents were implied by law or otherwise imposed by society,213 it was a concept perilously close to status. The connection with status was viewed as both dangerous and regressive. Enough has been written about contract and status so that little needs to be added here, but a specifica- tion of the context may be useful. For writers before the classical theo- rists, contract and status were closely related concepts, sharing the basic characteristic of relying on societally imposed duties within a relation- ship. The shift to promise, and with it to party control over the content of obligations, was viewed as an evolutionary advance of individual auton- omy. But the classical theorists' determination to distinguish contract from status was not based simply on a mindless slavishness toward Henry Maine's oft-quoted aphorism that "the movement of the progressive soci- eties has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract."214 It is true that the attempt to purge status from the law of contract was part of a rhetorical strategy to limit the imposition of standardized duties that formed the bulk of the economic regulation of the period. But classical scholars were working in an historical context where the association of status with slavery and the limitation of women's (primarily married wo- men's) rights was relatively fresh in legal consciousness. Thus, the classi- cal rejection of status is complex, and perhaps much more easily defensi- ble than the same maneuver in succeeding generations.215 213. Recall Parsons's discussion.

Economy of Contract Versus Economy of Gift Exchange A second track in the creation of a promise based regime of contract is the distinction between a contractual economy and an economy of gift exchange. Economies based on gift exchange have been discussed exten- sively by anthropologists since the beginning of the twentieth century, but the concept was probably completely foreign to classical legal theorists. I therefore use the concept not to describe what classical legal theorists (or any other legal scholars) were actually thinking about the regime of con- tract they were creating, but to illuminate the effects of a rhetoric of promise based exchange. The economies of gift exchange analyzed by anthropologists existed in communities where there were no state institu- tions. Individuals or entire social groups (tribes) would make gifts to other individuals or groups, who were obligated by custom to reciprocate with larger gifts.216 The economy of the United States in the late nineteenth century did not resemble such an arrangement, but there are some salient points of comparison. Many of the working relationships that governed people's lives, then as now, were relationships that implied reciprocal behavior. However, only a small part of that reciprocity was bargained over explic- itly. For classical theorists, an important part of the reconceptualization of consideration consisted in purging contract of its unbargained-for ele- ments, by denying enforcement to obligations undertaken without ex- plicit bargaining. I will return to the rhetorical effects of distinguishing a bargain-exchange economy from a gift economy momentarily, but for now, it is worth noting a difference on this point between classical theo- rists and the generations of scholars that followed them. As shown above, for classical theorists the dividing line between enforceable and nonen- forceable promises "ran at the boundary between bargain promises and gratuitous promises,"217 that is, whatever was not explicitly bargained for. Modern theorists, on the other hand, draw the line at the donative prom- ise, that is, the unrelied-on noncommercial promise of a gift. For the classical theorist, then, the question of consideration was a question about economic organization and regulation, in a way that it is not for the modern gift theorist. But in this sense, the economic features that classical scholars were purging from contract make the comparison to the gift exchange economy relevant. 216. For the classic analysis of gift exchange in the anthropological literature, see Marcel Mauss, The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies (W.D. Halls trans., 1990) (1925); see also Marshall Sahlins, Stone Age Economics 149-275 (1972) (outlining a sociology of gift exchange, noting that it is a mechanism for circulating goods as well as a system for defining and maintaining social status). 217.

Formation Versus Content The third track in the creation of the promise centered regime of contract is the shift in attention from the content of contractual obliga- tions to the formation of obligations. Preclassical contract theory de- voted most of its energies to the content of obligations among various parties to standardized relationships. It devoted very little attention to offer and acceptance-questions surrounding the formation of contrac- tual obligations.218 Classical theory radically realigned the priorities, making questions of formation absolutely central to the scheme of con- tract generally. Until recently, modern contract theory was similarly ob- sessed with issues of formation,219 and the current wave of writing on gifts extends this preoccupation. Current writers' arguments that the law of formation, and specifically the demarcation of the line between enforcea- ble and unenforceable promises, will have direct social effects, represent an elaboration and deepening of the view that formation is the central issue of contract law. However, I would suggest that the focus is misplaced. In fact, the rhetoric of promise enforcement exerts its most significant effects else- where, by generating a widely agreed upon and even assumed framework for the delineation of the content of contractual obligations. The height- ened attention to formation through promise, and the unquestioned as- sumption that the parties' obligations flow from promises that formed the contract, draw decisionmakers toward those promises as the sole source of the parties' obligations. Thus, it is not the location of the line between the enforceable and unenforceable that matters; instead, it is the rhetori- cal framework (regardless of where the line is actually drawn) that leads decisionmakers to accept promise as the font from which obligation flows, obscuring the role of societally imposed obligations on contractual partners. The effect of the framework created by the debate over which promises should be enforced is felt, then, in the attitude of deci- sionmakers toward the content of contractual obligation, rather than in its purported locus of application, the formation of the contract. D. Convergences In conclusion, I will venture to speculate on how these parallel tracks of distinction, inherited from the classical revolution in consideration 218. Kevin Teevan points out that until the nineteenth century, "there were still no rules of offer and acceptance." In fact, "there was no concern about when a contract was formed-the parties either emerged from face-to-face negotiations with an agreement or they didn't. There was little discussion in the cases about whether a promise was revocable but rather whether a promise was actionable short of reliance." Kevin M. Teevan, A History of the Anglo-American Common Law of Contract 175, 177 (1990). 219. The recent flood of writing on default rules in contract is something of an antidote to this obsession. See, e.g., Symposium, Default Rules and Contractual Consent, 3 S. Cal. Interdisc. L.J. 1 (1993).</page><page sequence="76">2001 ] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1951 doctrine, in fact intersect to inflect contract thinking.220 There are at least three areas of convergence of the three differentiations outlined above. The view of contract engendered by the distinctions generates idealized images of spheres of human activity, of the judicial role, and finally, of the individual. It matters little whether anyone is willing to defend the idealizations as an accurate depiction of society: No one may be willing to do so, and no such defense is necessary. The important thing is that the idealizations function by creating general background understandings of social life that profoundly affect how decisionmakers interpret situations and approach problems. 1. Spheres of Activity: The Market. - The rejection of status and gift exchange, and the attention to formation rather than content, are part of a reimagination of the market as a distinct sphere of activity. Throughout the nineteenth century, the image of the market and the image of con- tract were undergoing a related transformation. The market, once un- derstood as heavily regulated, was increasingly being imagined as "free." Contract, once understood as informed by state mandated duties among the parties, was increasingly being understood as a realm of private law- making. Together, these images support the common perception about what a system of private ordering amounts to.221 Classical theorists cre- ated the legal framework embodying such understandings out of the de- tails of doctrine, without explicitly adopting any social theory about the market or private ordering.222 But the rhetorical power of "freedom of contract" relies directly on the conception of contract as a realm of indi- vidual control of obligation, and that conception relies in turn on classi- cal reformulations of doctrine. Again, the whole is larger than the sum of its parts: It is not the outcome of the conflicts regarding particular rules 220. I invoke this paradox intentionally. The different levels of distinction seem to be unrelated issues, but their overall thrust is to push the rhetoric of contract in the same direction. In that sense, they are like parallel forces whose effects intersect, and are in turn strengthened by that intersection. One way of thinking about this is through a psychoanalytical analogy, saying that the point of intersection is overdetermined. See J. Laplanche &amp; J.-B. Pontalis, The Language of Psycho-Analysis 292-93 (Donald Nicholson- Smith trans., W.W. Norton 1973) (1967). 221. Michael Trebilcock provides one articulation of what the system is: In the case of a market economy, production and consumption decisions are decentralized and depend on the myriad decisions of individual producers and consumers, acting in furtherance of individual preferences and incentives, thus minimizing the role played by social conventions or status in traditional societies and centralized information gathering and processing and coercion in command economies. Michael J. Trebilcock, The Limits of Freedom of Contract 2 (1993). 222. Indeed, when drawn into the realm of social theory, classical scholars were likely to reject philosophical articulations about a necessary connection between the limitation of regulation and freedom. See Samuel Williston, Freedom of Contract, 6 Cornell L.Q. 365, 365-72 (1921) (rejecting the argument that individual freedom requires a will theory of contract and the limitation of regulation thought to flow from it).</page><page sequence="77">1952 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 that is central,223 but rather the creation of a framework of rules that puts the focus on individual choice instead of societally imposed obliga- tions.224 Rules of formation and excuses may be relaxed, promissory es- toppel may be recognized as a substitute for consideration, consideration itself may withdraw from the question of enforcing commercial promises, but none of these changes alters the basic framework articulated by classi- cal contract law. And that framework is central in supporting the image of the market as the realm of free individual action.225 2. Judicial Role. - The second area of convergence of the distinc- tions created by classical contract theory, closely related to the reimagina- tion of the market, is the conception of the judicial role. It is not my intention, this late in the day, to advance any substantiated theory of the judicial role, or even of the connection between classical contract doc- trine and the judicial role.226 I have a much more modest goal at this stage, which is to point out an obvious but constantly forgotten preten- sion of the classical contract framework. To the extent that classical scholars succeeded in maintaining the three distinctions presented above,227 they seemed to be making a case for the idea thatjudges merely facilitated, and did not regulate; that they enforced obligations freely un- 223. As shown above, classical theorists disagreed among themselves about the right answers to particular doctrinal conflicts, and changes in particular rules have been legion since their time. See supra text accompanying notes 53-62. 224. In a recent article, Richard Epstein defends laissez-faire against its critics, arguing that laissez-faire has no "intimate connection [with] the formal doctrines of contract." Richard A. Epstein, Contracts Small and Contract Large: Contract Law Through the Lens of Laissez-Faire, in The Fall and Rise of Freedom of Contract 25, 26 (F.H. Buckley ed., 1999). Epstein is right that the outcomes of particular conflicts over rules can vary within a system of laissez-faire, but by analyzing particular rules in isolation, he seriously misses the potential effects of a structure of rules as a whole. See id. at 35-58. 225. The flip side of the articulation of the market sphere is the bounding off of a family sphere, where relations are hierarchical and not based on consent, but which is characterized by values such as love and trust. For a critique of the effects of such a division into spheres, see Frances E. Olsen, The Family and the Market: A Study of Ideology and Legal Reform, 96 Harv. L. Rev. 1497, 1563-69 (1983). Support for the division into spheres as a safeguard against the commodification of important values is expressed by Eisenberg, who seems to argue that if the alienated world of legal enforcement is allowed to enter the bastion of trust (the family), the values that characterize it will be in jeopardy, and may not survive. Eisenberg, World of Contract, supra note 35, at 847-49. Critics of the position rightly maintain that rather than preserving those values by fencing them off in some purified realm, it makes sense to advocate their adoption and strengthening wherever they happen to be appropriate, including at times in the business world. See Robert W. Gordon, Unfreezing Legal Reality: Critical Approaches to Law, 15 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 194, 214-17 (1987); Rose, Giving Some Back, supra note 188, at 373-75; Rose, Giving, Trading, supra note 116, at 313-17. 226. Duncan Kennedy has revisited this question repeatedly over the last quarter century. For a recent detailed effort, see Duncan Kennedy, A Critique of Adjudication: Fin de Siecle 82-92, 202-12 (1997). 227. Favoring contract over status (or customary relationship), contractual economy over an economy of gift exchange, and questions of formation over those of content of obligation.</page><page sequence="78">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1953 dertaken by the parties, and did not impose obligations whose sources lay elsewhere. This at once contributes to and is informed by the vision of the market as a "free" realm, where "private lawmakers" can design their own duties.228 The conception of the judicial passivity that flows from the distinctions is not a logical necessity, but the rhetorical connection is strong.229 Again, none of the particular rules of consideration need sur- vive to leave the rhetorical image of the judge as facilitator in place: It is the framework that performs the labor of making this image plausible. 3. The Calculating Individual Subject. - Finally, the third area of con- vergence is the creation of an ideal image of the contracting individual. The combination of distinctions outlined above is part of a rejection of the complexity of relational patterns, in which obligations were often un- dertaken implicitly without direct and explicit bargaining over the value of reciprocal obligations. Reciprocity was part of the pattern, but it was not necessarily strictly defined or bargained over. People continued, and continue now, to undertake such obligations, and judges have never with- drawn completely from enforcing and policing such relationships. Classi- cal theorists, however, attempted to purge such complexity from the ide- alized vision of contracting. Gratuitous undertakings are the key example. Classical scholars could not deny the existence of gratuitous undertakings, usually assumed in the course of commercial dealings. They did, however, define them out of contract law because of the diffi- culties in ascertaining the precise elements of exchange that they en- tailed.230 Thus, part of the classical project was the advancement of an image of the economy in which participants made strictly rational choices based on bargained-for exchange. Only such transactions as fit the ideal image would be accorded the privilege of legal enforcement.231 The de- 228. These phrases are evocative of the private ordering paradigm, and while they resonate as if they refer to the will theory of contract, they are defensible without resort to it as well. One could easily imagine such support from libertarians, economists, or even liberals who had abandoned the will theory, including classical theorists like Williston or later theorists like Fuller. For an explanation of the connection between will theory and the various phases in American contract theory, see Kennedy, Will Theory, supra note 172, at 115-17, 126-35. 229. How many times has the maxim "judges will not make contracts for the parties" been invoked when judges refused to apply a norm of fairness? It makes no difference, from my perspective, that judges often still apply fairness norms, circumventing this rhetorical retort to their activity. The fact is that on the plane of argument, the ability to resort to such a slogan has taken on significant persuasive force. Mark Petit, discussing the rhetorical power of certain arguments in contract discourse, has said: The practical significance of the definitional debate is, as I have suggested earlier, the rhetorical power of the concept of freedom. Basing an argument on freedom is like playing an ace in a high-card-wins card game. Few cards in the deck can match it, and no card beats it. Mark Petit, Jr., Freedom, Freedom of Contract, and the "Rise and Fall," 79 B.U. L. Rev. 263, 280 (1999). 230. See supra text accompanying notes 70-77. 231. It would be a mistake to assume that this idealization is limited to classical scholars. It motivates important scholarly contributions from Fuller's conception of the</page><page sequence="79">1954 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101:1876 nial of gratuitous undertakings is thus analogically equivalent to a denial of the image of the economy of gift exchange, where the basis of ex- change was uncertain and unverifiable. Commenting on the significance of the distinction between these two images of the economy, sociologist Pierre Bourdieu offers an analysis worth quoting at some length: Among the consequences of the process through which the economic field was constituted as such, one of the most perni- cious, from the point of view of knowledge, is the tacit accept- ance of a certain number of principles of di-vision, the emer- gence of which is correlative with the social construction of the economic field as a separate field (on the basis of the axiom "business is business"), as the opposition between passions and interests .... The gift economy, in contrast to the economy where equivalent values are exchanged, is based on a denial of the eco- nomic (in the narrow sense), a refusal of the logic of the max- imization of economic profit, i.e., of the spirit of calculation and the exclusive pursuit of material (as opposed to symbolic) inter- est, a refusal which is inscribed in the objectivity of institutions and in dispositions.... ... The possibility that then opens up of subjecting every kind of activity to the logic of calculation ("in business there's no room for sentiment") tends to legitimate this, so to speak, official cynicism that is particularly flaunted in law (for example, with contracts providing for the most pessimistic and disreputa- ble eventualities) and in economic theory (which, at the begin- ning, helped to create this economy, just as jurists' treatises on the State helped to create the State). This economy... leads to the legitimation of the use of calculation even in the most sa- cred areas (the prayer wheel) and the generalization of the cal- culating disposition, the perfect antithesis of the generous disposi- tion, which comes hand in hand with the development of an economic and social order characterized, as Weber puts it, by calculability and predictability.232 "Contractual Archetype" through Eisenberg's idea of separate worlds of contract and gift. See Fuller, supra note 169, at 815; Eisenberg, World of Contract, supra note 35, at 847-49. 232. Pierre Bourdieu, Marginalia-Some Additional Notes on the Gift, in The Logic of The Gift: Toward an Ethic of Generosity 231, 234-35 (Alan D. Schrift ed., Richard Nice trans., 1997). Elsewhere, Bourdieu offers a more general account of what the spirit of calculability amounts to: Economism recognizes no other form of interest than that which capitalism has produced, through a kind of real operation of abstraction, by setting up a universe of relations between man and man based, as Marx says, on "callous cash payment" and more generally by favouring the creation of relatively autonomous fields, capable of establishing their own axiomatics (through the fundamental tautology "business is business", on which "the economy" is based). It can therefore find no place in its analyses, still less in its calculations, for any form of "non-economic" interest. It is as if economic calculation had been able to appropriate the territory objectively assigned to the remorseless logic of what</page><page sequence="80">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1955 Bourdieu, of course, is writing about a much earlier stage in the transfor- mation of economic life. But the transformation is not singular: Like many of a culture's formative events, its fate is to be repeated in new contexts. It should not be surprising, therefore, that Bourdieu's words sound as if they could be describing the unwitting effects of classical con- tract theory in turning gifts into such a problematic category. The prob- lem with gifts for classical theory, on this view, is that they imply an indi- vidual who is not subject to a law of preservation of capital. In other words, gifts are seen as one-sided transfers of goods, within a system that can only recognize the individuals that make up the system as maximiz- ers.233 As such, they should not be willing to give up something for noth- ing. Therefore, in the absence of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the theory would like to presume against gifts, which are seen as evidence of an irrationality of action. But such a view is based on a knowing denial: Every observer of the system realizes that everyone makes gifts. Some are rationalized by describing them as part of a wider system of exchange (gifts for occasions, birthdays, weddings, etc.), and some by reference to a system of wealth preservation within a family structure (gifts, especially of real estate, to children). But the actual use of gifts is much wider, includ- ing gifts by the most rational of individuals, the "quintessential economic man,"234 the corporation.235 Corporations routinely make gifts to em- ployees, to clients, to potential clients, and lately most significantly, to political candidates or parties. Gifts are the oil that keeps the property regime lubricated and running, where particularized exchange is a mov- ing part, liable to be eroded without such lubrication. Why then, does the system adhere to its denial regarding the place of gifts, by pushing them out of the category of enforceability? The answer, or a reformula- tion of the question, lies in the system's investment in the idealization of the individual, as someone whose actions are calculating, and calculable. Marx calls "naked self-interest", only by relinquishing an island of the "sacred", miraculously spared by the "icy waters of egoistic calculation", the refuge of what has no price because it has too much or too little. But, above all, it can make nothing of universes that have not performed such a dissociation and so have, as it were, an economy in itself and not for itself. Pierre Bourdieu, The Logic of Practice 113 (Richard Nice trans., 1990) (1980). 233. A straightforward articulation of this idea comes from one of its enthusiastic proponents: It is true that all individuals differ in natural endowments, in personal ambitions, in social roles, and in institutional expectations. But there is one thing that each of them wants and wants just because each is an A or a B: more. . . . This characteristic of wanting more is universal. It applies with equal force to both greedy and rapacious firms and self-interested individuals. Richard A. Epstein, Simple Rules for a Complex World 75 (1995). 234. Gregory A.

Modern con- tract doctrine has reformed most of the rules that seemed extreme in their idealization of the calculating or bargaining individual. But the cal- culating subject is a product of the framework that supported those rules, not of the individual rules by themselves, and the framework still grounds contract discourse. CONCLUSION: AGAINST A METAPHYSICS OF CONTRACT AS PROMISE It is widely accepted, within legal academia and outside it, that con- tract law is about enforcing promises.237 That acceptance is the first mea- sure of the success of the classical revolution in contract thinking. More than positing a new definition of contract, the classical revolution was so sweeping as to generate a reinterpretation of the history of contract.238 Based on an understanding instilled in every student of contract since the late nineteenth century, we have all been trained to read the history of contract backwards, as the often misunderstood but finally perfected art of enforcing promises. It has become nearly impossible to read the his- tory of contract without initially conceiving of contract as an issue of en- forcing promises, whence the necessity of dividing promises into the en- forceable and unenforceable kinds. In this sense, the classical thinkers established a metaphysics of contract, reasoning that earlier conceptions of contract were primitive, unperfected, incomplete, but that the real ba- sis of contract was eternal. 236. Indeed, even some law and economics scholars appear to be showing signs of abandoning this idealization as the basis of their analyses. See Christine Jolls, Cass R. Sunstein &amp; Richard Thaler, A Behavioral Approach to Law and Economics, 50 Stan. L. Rev. 1471, 1473-75 (1998) (discussing the ways economists' assumptions must be relaxed in order to make economic analysis of the law more useful). 237. One clear indication stems from definitions: Pollock's definition, supra text accompanying note 69, became the basis for the most traditional and widely accepted American definitions of contract. See Restatement of Contracts ? 1 (1932) ("A contract is a promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty."); Restatement (Second) of Contracts ? 1 (1981) (same); 1 Williston 1st ed., supra note 25, ? 1 ("A contract is a promise, or set of promises, to which the law attaches legal obligation."). 238. Grant Gilmore famously commented that classical scholars, primary among them Holmes, Langdell, and Williston, had to perform "major surgery" on the cases in order to arrive at their general theory of contract, and he offered competing readings of several leading cases to justify his viewpoint. See Gilmore, supra note 58, at 24. Gilmore's history and theory have become objects of routine disparagement, but Gilmore's first calling was literary criticism, and his insights into the Nietzschean mode by which the classical interpretation of contract became dominant, and its violence in ousting previously popular interpretations of contract, remain salient. By subjecting the cases to a rereading, and by emphasizing how controversial the classical interpretations and classifications of the cases were when they appeared, Gilmore reminds us of the creative power of classical theorizing.</page><page sequence="82">2001] THE GIFT BEYOND THE GRAVE 1957 My claim in this Article has not been that all such views are based on a misunderstanding. Indeed, contract is a conception, an intellectual construct: It is primarily what people believe it to be. The popular belief is not wrong. But there may be better beliefs available, if someone has the impulse to look. This Article does not seek to establish an alternative metaphysics of contract. It does, however, suggest that it would be more useful to think about contract as a framework for cooperation, the central element of which is the set of relationships whose terms are potentially regulated by the state.239 This conception is both a better account of judicial practice, and a way to improve on that practice by ridding it of those commitments that have the effect of limiting contract's fairness- promoting, or redistributive potential.240 Contract is a conception, and thus, it may be reconceived, or reimagined. A prod to our imagination, and a reminder that the current conception is neither timeless nor tran- scendent, is the fact that only one hundred fifty years ago, contract was conceived of quite differently. The transformation of contract is tied to economic and social changes too complex to have been considered here, but its technical doctrinal manifestation is visible in the work of classical theorists. My claim here has been that what classical consideration theory undertook piecemeal, it achieved wholesale. The rhetorical framework that made enforcing promises into the centerpiece of contract retains its power today, and perhaps is the major factor limiting contract's trans- formative potential. 239. One of the important parts of such a view of contract would be some account of how potential regulation works, not only when the potential is exercised, but also when it remains in the shadows, since the refusal of the state to exercise power over a given relationship allows whoever wields power within the relationship to violate the relationship's norms with impunity. 240. At least one scholar has made the case that the best reading of the history of contract should place the fairness of distribution at its center, while retaining the focus on promise enforcement. See Gordley, supra note 185, at 548 (arguing that American court decisions regarding consideration, promissory reliance, and offer and acceptance turn on the effect of the transaction on the distribution of wealth between the parties, with the fairness of the transaction being paramount).</page></plain_text>
