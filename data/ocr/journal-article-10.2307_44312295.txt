<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christianity and Literature Vol. 43, No. 2 (Winter 1994) Symbol, Idol, and Belief in Dmitrii Merezhkovskii's The Death of the Gods Glenn A. Davis In an essay published in 1893 titled "On the Reasons for the Decline and on the New Trends in Contemporary Russian Literature" ("O prichinakh"), Dmitrii Merezhkovskii argued that the final decades of the nineteenth century had seen a significant decline in the quality of Russian literature as a result of the forces of positivism then pervasive in Russian educated society. In order to revive Russian literature and thought, he appealed to his fellow writers to look to symbolism, ideal- ism, and spiritual awareness for ways to go beyond the nominalism which had limited the Russian world to the natural and social. Merezhkovskii and others who contributed to this cultural renascence at the turn of the century reawakened a spiritual, and specifically Christ- ian, dimension within Russia, a dimension that had effectively been closed to educated Russia for many years (see Zernov 87). Merezhkovskii attempted to develop further his religious and liter- ary ideas in his trilogy of historical novels titled Christ and Antichrist, which was published between 1896 and 1905. The first part, The Death of the Gods: Julian the Apostate (1896), is an attempt to stimulate inter- est in religion by foregrounding the issues that had challenged ancient paganism and nascent Christianity in the fourth century.1 Studies of Merezhkovskii have correctly concentrated on the philosophy of his- tory put forth in the novel, that being the attempt to work out the dialectical relationship between paganism, representing the truth of the flesh, and Christianity, representing the truth of the soul.2 But no matter how strongly the philosophy of history is stated in the novel and analyzed in works of criticism (Nikolai Berdiaev has suggested that these novels "are a vehicle for Merezhkovskii's ideological schemes" [224]), we must not forget the importance Merezhkovskii placed on symbol and belief. It is the thesis of this article that the writer's attempt to revive the elements of symbol and belief, both intricately bound in The Death of the Gods, is undermined by those ideological schemes. 151</page><page sequence="2">152 Glenn A. Davis I The Death of the Gods was written in 1893-94 when Merezhkovskii was making a serious study of the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome. While exploring the ancients, the Russian author found special histori- cal significance in the figure of Julian, emperor of Byzantium from 361 to 363, who had led a pagan reaction against Christianity. For Merezhkovskii the interest lay in the dialectical play within Julian of the historical tension between paganism and Christianity, a theme which at the end of the nineteenth century seemed significant for the destiny of the Russian nation, at that time fighting its own battles of belief (Stammler 126). The Death of the Gods recreates Julian's struggle to choose between the dying paganism of the ancients and an increas- ingly powerful and influential Christianity. Although at first the young emperor accepts the spiritualism of the new Christian religion, he re- jects its asceticism, its denial of beauty and its scorn for the material world. For Julian Christianity exemplifies the faith of slaves obsessed with suffering and death. He concludes that only a neopaganism, with its life-affirming vision, can release humanity from the tension of earthly existence between the antithetical poles of flesh and spirit. As studies have demonstrated, Merezhkovskii's interpretation of Julian was greatly influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche's thought; Julian is the world-historical figure who would transcend the historical epoch through the will to power in order to revive worldly human existence and stimulate the "grand epoch-making shift in moral consciousness" (Clowes 126) .3 But what is significant for us here is the fact that Merezhkovskii was particularly struck by Nietzsche's observation that all art - beauty in particular - is anathema to Christianity. As Nietzsche put it, In truth, nothing could be more opposed to the purely aesthetic inter- pretation and justification of the world which are taught in this book than the Christian teaching, which is, and wants to be, only moral and which relegates art, every art, to the realm of lies-, with its absolute stan- dards, beginning with the truthfulness of God, it negates, judges, and damns art. Behind this mode of thought and valuation, which must be hostile to art if it is at all genuine, I never failed to sense a hostility to life - a furious, vengeful antipathy to life itself: for all of life is based on semblance, art, deception, points of view, and the necessity of perspec- tives and error. (23) The dialectical struggle within the protagonist Julian is not simply a struggle between competing religious faiths; it is also a struggle be- tween competing aesthetic viewpoints. In other words, the rift be-</page><page sequence="3">Merezhkovskii's The Death of the Gods 153 tween paganism and Christianity is threshed out in the aesthetic cate- gories of symbol and idol. In the end Julian fails as Merezhkovskii's agent of spiritual regeneration because the full blossoming of the Nietzschean aspects of the self effectively closes him off from the tran- scendent dimensions attached to the symbolic image. Merezhkovskii's Julian is an idolater who battles the non-literal. The Death of the Gods presents the inherent conflict between "literalism" and the literary trope of symbol, which demands recognition of the transcendent through a suspension of disbelief. A discussion of literalism and symbolism must be viewed against the background of the nature of belief. Daniel M. McVeigh has recently written that "none of us sees with the eyes of God, only darkly in im- ages and figures. Truth comes to us incompletely and symbolically, held up before eyes strained in the sun, and there will always be some- one who deems our oasis just another mirage" (152). The philosopher Eric Voegelin similarly referred to cognitio fidei, "knowledge in the manner of faith, through trust in the language that opens up the heights and depths of existence through analogies" (Webb 62). Symbolic lan- guage, as an instrument of faith and belief, encourages interaction be- tween literature and theology and makes them "cousins" (McVeigh 153). Given the nature of language and the functions of tropes, both theol- ogy and literature may claim "literalism" as a common enemy, which, as T. R. Wright has shown, leads either to absurdity or to idolatry (13- 20). Symbol and metaphor require the reader's surrendering to the trope in order for the reader to understand symbolic and metaphoric significance.4 Merezhkovskii directly addresses the nature of symbolic language, religion, and belief in his writings, many of which helped spawn a new religious renaissance in Russia. His article "On the Reasons for the Decline" is generally recognized as the first major statement on behalf of Russian symbolism. The article includes important analyses which find and emphasize deep religious understanding in Russian literature, but more importantly it puts forth the primary tenets of a new literary aesthetic founded upon a spiritual awareness. The blame for much of the debasement and corruption of Russian literature and culture is put squarely on the artist's dependence on positivism, which renders real- ity no larger than the language used to express that reality. Merezhkovskii offers that there is always something beyond "things as they are": "The idea of such symbolic characters [e.g., Don Quixote, Hamlet] cannot be related by any words, for words only define and limit thought, and symbols express the limitless part of thought." Merezhkovskii goes on to assert that the function of the symbol is to affect the sensitivity of the reader (or viewer), and that the symbol "acts</page><page sequence="4">154 Glenn A. Davis more strongly on the heart than what is expressed by words" ("O prichinakh" 249). He approvingly quotes the famous line from F. I. Tiutchev's poem "Silentium": "The thought uttered is a lie" ("Mysl' izrechennaia est' lozh'"). Central to Merezhkovskii's concept of the symbol is beauty, and, working within the Kantian tradition, he frees beauty from any prior moral conceptualizations by emphasizing the formal essence of the symbol: "The beauty of the image cannot be false and that is why it cannot be immoral. Only deformity, only banality in art, is immoral" ("O prichinakh" 235-36). In The Death of the Gods this claim for the special role of beauty rests squarely on the pagan side of the religious equation. This idea, owing much to Nietzsche, understands the Christ- ian attitude toward beauty as deleterious. The point further under- scores the complex role of beauty in Merezhkovskii's ideology, which proposes a reconciliation or synthesis between paganism and Christ- ianity. The knotty problem of beauty in Christian aesthetics has re- cently been explored by Jaroslav Pelikan: As the iconoclasts saw with great clarity, the Beautiful was (and is) the most subtle and the most dangerous of the triad [of Beauty, the True, and the Good]: the dangers of identifying the Holy with the True (intel- lectualism) and with the Good (moralism) have manifested themselves repeatedly in the history of Judaism and Christianity, but it is notewor- thy that both the Second Commandment itself and the message of the Hebrew prophets singled out the identification of the Holy with the Beautiful as the special temptation to sin. The formulation of an aes- thetic that came to terms with the reality of this temptation called for philosophical and theological sophistication. (94) How Merezhkovskii attempts to reconcile the pagan concept of beauty without committing the sin of idolatry is an important, though subtle, issue in The Death of the Gods. The question of the nature of the symbol, indeed of the literary act itself, was important for the development of literary theory in Russia during the period of symbolism. The inquiry into literary theory in the Eastern Orthodox tradition has been pursued by Steven Cassedy, who traces the discussion of the nature of the image and its significance to the period of iconoclasm in the eighth century. St. John of Damascus, as Cassedy points out, reconciled the "not-human" of the Trinity with anthropomorphic rendering by reasoning that one venerates the image or icon not as God but as the image of God incarnate. Just as God "emptied" himself of His divinity to take the form of man in His Son in an act of humiliation or kenosis, so the artistic image too is an act of kenosis. The image or symbol is the seeing of "'the invisible made visible through the visible representation'" (103).5</page><page sequence="5">Merezhkovskii's The Death of the Gods 155 The argument justifying the creation of sacred objects by human hands proved victorious within the Church four centuries after the reign of Emperor Julian. Nevertheless, this eighth-century conflict over the nature of the artistic representation of sacred objects and the conflict between symbolism and idolatry are significant for our understanding of Merezhkovskii's The Death of the Gods, precisely because Julian re- jects the iconoclasm of the Christians who, as depicted in the novel, view all sacred images as literal representations or idols. On the other hand, the Christians see Julian's restoration of pagan images as idolatry as well, not simply because the pagan images represent false gods but, more importanfly, because they represent "the vain attempt of the hu- man worshiper to cross the gulf by pretending that an artistic, histori- cal image mounted on the wall or held in the hand was in fact a cosmic and metaphysical image with some genuine affinity to the First Prin- ciple of the universe."6 Much of Emperor Julian's rejection of Christianity rests on that religion's putative iconoclasm. Merezhkovskii's protagonist emphati- cally states (as did Nietzsche) that it is the Christians who are the true idolaters and destroyers of beauty. Addressing the accusation of idola- try, Julian states: Idol! That is your word. What kind of imbeciles do you take us for, if you think that we worship the very matter of our gods, the copper, the stone, the wood. All your preachers wish to convince themselves, us, and others of this. But it is a lie. We honor not the dead stone, nor the metal, nor the wood, but the soul, the living soul of beauty in our gods, in our representations of the purest divine beauty. It is not we who are the idolaters, but you, devouring each other like wild beasts because of an "iota"; you, who kiss the rot of the bones of criminals punished for breaking the Roman laws It is the limit of madness and infamy that the descendants of the Hellenes, having read Plato and Homer, rush (where? Oh abomination!) to an outcast tribe, a tribe almost extermi- nated by Vespasian and Titus, in order to deify a dead Israelite! . . . And you still dare to accuse us of idolatry! (327-28)7 Merezhkovskii's Julian attempts to deny idolatry by working to restore and affirm belief in physical representations of symbolic truths open to a reality larger than themselves. However, he does not successfully impart in the restoration of those artistic representations the transcen- dent elements that must accompany symbol, for symbolism and tran- scendent belief are undermined by Julian's quest for knowledge of ulti- mate reality. The figure of Julian, instead of clarifying Merezhkovskii's position on the nature of religious symbolism, complicates it. The novel itself, through the complex relationship between paganism and Christianity,</page><page sequence="6">156 Glenn A. Davis works to deny Julian an aesthetic victory, as in the end he is closed off from symbolic transcendence. A conflict arises between the political aims of symbol and metaphor and their religious and aesthetic values.8 Julian's difficult struggle in the novel includes not simply overcoming the moral consciousness of his day in a Nietzschean fashion, but also remaining open to the transcendent. Analysis of The Death of the Gods reveals that the victory over moral consciousness effectively closes Julian off from a transcendent symbolic rendering of existence. As Julian develops as a character in the novel, he becomes more and more pre- occupied with his apotheosis as the "man-god," the first step toward which is the denunciation of transcendence (see Walsh 22). II The essential bond between symbol and belief unfolds early in the novel. In the scene under discussion, Julian is converted nominally from Christianity to paganism; through a symbolic agent, a statue of Aphrodite, the reader recognizes the conversion as an act of surrender, as a leap of faith: While leaning against the wall Julian timidly raised his eyes, held his breath and froze. It was she Under the open sky, in the midst of the temple, just new-born of the sea-foam, stood cold, white Aphrodite Anadyomene in all her unashamed nakedness She came down towards him, nearer, nearer. . . . Her slender white arms wound around his neck. The child gave himself up to the passionless embraces with a passionless smile; the cold of the marble ran through to the depths of his heart This divine embrace bore no resemblance to the sickly passionate, heavy, burning embraces of Amaryllis. His soul freed itself from earthly love. It was the final peace, similar to an ambrosial night of Homer, similar to the sweet rest of the dead. (33-34)s As the ancient god comforts his disturbed soul, Julian responds: "Aphrodite! Aphrodite! thou shalt be my everlasting love!" (46). Julian's sudden infatuation with the statue sets in motion his trans- formation from youthful Christian faith toward neopagan worship of the earthy and physically beautiful. Yet here the reader sees the devel- opment of Julian's struggle between transcendent beauty located be- yond the material of the statue and the very physical material of the statue itself. Although the lack of warmth in Aphrodite's embrace is favorably compared with the "sickly passionate" embraces of the hu- man Amaryllis elsewhere in the novel, here Julian reaches for the tran- scendent, for the ideal of beauty, but his imagination is held back. Amaryllis's embrace of the flesh sickens him, but the coldness of the</page><page sequence="7">Merezhkovskii's The Death of the Gods 157 marble fails to release the idea of beauty from its physical manifesta- tion. For Julian there is no "in-between"; peace comes only through an escape from earthly existence. The intoxication with Aphrodite's beauty initiates the conflict in the novel between mere physical appearance of the image and the symbolic idea situated beyond the image. Here the symbolic is cold and lifeless, whereas the warmth of the earth is under- stood in a literal sense. Young Julian, tutored in Christian myth and symbolism, strains to harmonize the decidedly moral interpretations of myths and symbols with his ideal of pagan beauty pointing beyond the moral. The question of literalism, or the truth of the earth, is raised again by Arsinoé, who like Julian is searching for a reconciliation of the two truths. When Julian first sees Arsinoé, he is struck by the beauty of her athletic form. He engages what he believes are the Christian views of the flesh as a temptation to sin: Now he watched directly and eagerly the girl hurling the disk, no longer ashamed and feeling that it would not be proper or wise to be ashamed. She walked back several steps, inclined her body forward, and having put forth her left leg and her right arm with the disk, she swung with a powerful movement - and threw the metal circle so high that it shone in the rising sun, and in falling struck the foot of a distant pillar with a sound. It seemed to Julian that before him was an ancient Phidias statue of marble. (90-91) Through the narrator we see that Julian is attempting to abandon the Christian view that literal nakedness represents sinful temptations of the flesh. Reference to "shame" suggests that Julian, while reaching for the amoral ideal, recognizes an inner weakness as he attempts to step beyond Christian moral constraints. In fact, notwithstanding his desires, Julian does not often go beyond good and evil. His show of leniency at Christian transgressions against the pagan gods is interpreted by many of his supporters as a show of weakness. On the other hand, his one great step beyond moral con- sciousness is the singularly most ugly scene in the novel: the rape of his virgin wife. This scene is his attempt to exorcise the Christian spirit from his soul and to grasp hold of the powers of the flesh. But divorced from moral consciousness and moral transcendence, the scene denies any ideal of the beautiful. Julian's fight to go beyond literal interpretation is further demon- strated with reference to a Christian crucifix. As he recalls in a dream the murders of his family members, the crucifix appears as an object representing not a truth beyond words but rather the bloodshed of his family:</page><page sequence="8">158 Glenn A. Davis And the legions force all three to kiss the cross held in Eusebius's hands, and to take an oath to the new Emperor. Julian remembers the great enameled cross of cypress-wood depicting the Savior. Visible below, on the denk, old wood, were traces of fresh blood, which had stained the hands of the murderer holding the cross. (12) The blood on the cross does not symbolize that of his Savior; rather, it is the literal representation of the blood of his murdered family. Julian's personal experiences prevent him from accepting the smell of blood as the smell of the Rome that he wishes to revive, as another character in the novel earnestly advocates ("Without blood there is no joy, no great- ness on earth. The smell of blood is the smell of Rome" [252]). Julian does not go beyond the literal interpretation of the flesh. Consequently, he defines Christianity as a religion of literal death and weak submis- siveness. This literalism restricts the transcendence required of any religious and literary experience. Julian's inability to perceive the symbolic nature of religions flattens his character, limiting it to ideological development. This void is best illustrated by his deafness to oral poetry. Aesthetics for him is a boring subject. He insists that "the orator should be more concerned with the context [soderzhatiie] of speech" (100) than with the style or beauty of the words. Arsinoé agrees with him that rhetoric is ruinous. Her as- sessment that both Christian asceticism and pagan decay have pre- vented the birth of a new world arouses in Julian the quest for power and gnosis, the quest for deification of the self. By comparing the two appearances before Julian of ideal beauty, the reader may notice how they affect him in different ways. Aphrodite, the object of a prosopopoeiac act, convinces Julian that beauty is nei- ther immoral nor untruthful, as the Christians fear, but is worthy in its own right. Arsinoé, the woman turned statue, reawakens in Julian the dilemma of the Christian moral viewpoint: is he to feel shame in beauty? The image represents the tension between amoral beauty as the ideal and beauty as a temptation to sin. Julian states that he is not tempted in the Christian meaning of the word; however, he is tempted by the pagan belief in the free spirit of the ego as an escape from the tension. Arsinoe's appearance is significant because she sends Julian down a different path. Before their meeting Julian believes in transcendent symbols and in ideals like beauty, but afterwards he turns toward the pursuit of power. His goal shifts as Arsinoé implores him to embrace the ego, to seek transformation, to become a god. Reminding him that he must not fear hatred, deception, and ambition, she plays the sybil prophesying his glory in the will to power. Their physical embrace signals an unexpected effect: it diverts Julian from the symbolic, the transcendent and mysterious, toward an understanding and acceptance</page><page sequence="9">Merezhkovskii's The Death of the Gods 159 of the will to power with all its foundations in the unambiguous and immanent. This change in Julian's character parallels the changes in Merezhkovskii's development as a religious thinker, as pointed out by Bernice Glatzer Rosenthal: The years 1894- 1896 mark the highest point of Nietzsche's influence on Merezhkovsky. He exalted the Nietzschean values of courage, pride, and earthly beauty, and mocked Christian asceticism and humility. . . . Deliberately turning his back on those "other worlds" of symbolism that had not led him to a new faith, determined to forget the "mystery in all things," the "eternal darkness and horror," he set about overcom- ing the "fear of life" (and of death) that had enveloped him since child- hood. He would strive for earthly joy instead. ("Stages" 73) Merezhkovskii's quest for a new symbolic literature is derailed in The Death of the Gods because Julian cannot accept the realm of mystery inherent in symbolism.10 The author himself finds uncertainty episte- mologically difficult, and this is transferred to his literary creation. The figure of Arsinoé acts as the catalyst in the novel, steering Julian away from the ideal of beauty which has no value beyond itself to the quest for truth embodied in the individual's will to power. Julian is moti- vated by the pursuit of a single truth; he does not foresee the synthesis of the dual truths of Christianity and paganism. He sees these two religions only as competitors with no hope of synthesis. The tragedy is found in the novel's philosophy of historical progress: the ancient gods are passing away, yet Julian can neither accept the new nor usher in the resurrection of the old. The ancient world is seen only through memory. Paganism simply stimulates the remembrance of a past which cannot be renewed in the continuum of the present. Since there is no longer a reality beyond the pagan object, the old paganism can assert itself through Julian only as an ideology of the naked will to power. Julian is forced to concede the limitations of his pagan views and his lack of imagination: "Remembrance has more power over my soul than hope" (208). The quest for the symbolic representation of ideal beauty, therefore, becomes distorted and succumbs to a utilitarian interpretation in the novel. This is underscored by Arsinoe's proposal that she and Julian form an alliance of her beauty and his power. Arsinoé knows that the ego must assert itself; Julian desires to know but is hindered by his constant fear of the unknown, of the "mysteries, which are everywhere" (183). He denounces the Christians as idolaters yet has difficulty going beyond the arbitrariness of pagan "signs" and embracing a universal symbolism. Paganism does not release Julian from this fear as much as it closes his universe off from transcendence. Religious belief, albeit</page><page sequence="10">160 Glenn A. Davis pagan belief, is not an expression of the truth of the soul; rather, it is a release from the tension of existence, from the not-knowing. Ill Throughout the first half of The Death of the Gods the struggle be- tween the two world views of paganism and Christianity unfolds. As religions both demand the suspension of disbelief expressed through the medium of transcendent language. Merezhkovskii's Julian is not equipped to respond to the challenge for two seemingly paradoxical reasons. First, while he is troubled by the literal representations (the crucifix, Arsinoé), he fears even more the mystery of being. Second, he hopes not for the truth of the flesh but rather for flight from earthly existence. Julian's only escape is to become the "Antichrist," which he is declared to be at the end of the first half of the novel. From that point on the novel unveils a more ideologically conscious Julian who forsakes the mystery of being by striving to embody historical progress as immanent design. The novel's argument for an immanent historical structure and the protagonist's self-posturing as the Antichrist effec- tively close him off from the realm of the transcendent. The second half of the novel documents the journey to go beyond good and evil and to secure the transition from iniquity to light, from the realm of mystery to the realm of absolute truth found within the self. This grasp- ing after knowledge does not leave room for belief in the transcendent. The self becomes the ground for all things. Early in the novel the seeds of this revolt are planted by Iamblicus, who insists that Julian must have either strong enough faith to say that "He is" or enough strength of will to rebel and say "He is not." In order for Julian to succeed, Iamblicus instructs him to renounce all existence and even the utterance of existence. Only then can he be reabsorbed into the Godhead. Iamblicus preaches a dualism that places the mate- rial in direct opposition to the spiritual, accommodating the ideology of the work. "Renounce all that exists, all that is, - and yonder, in the abyss of abysses, in the depths of unspoken darkness, as in the light, you shall find Him. Give Him your friends, family, country, heaven, earth, yourself, and your reason as well. Then you will no longer see the lightf;] you yourself shall be light" (53). Iamblicus's sermon expli- cates the tension between material and spirit put forth in the novel, and his conclusion that one must choose either one or the other comes to fruition in Julian's imagination. Both Iamblicus and Julian deny the experience of involvement in a field of vertical reality as demanded by religious symbolism (see Webb 60). Iamblicus condemns all existence and its representations, includ-</page><page sequence="11">Merezhkovskii's The Death of the Gods i6l ing language, as idolatry. He calls for Julian to "affirm nothing," for His likeness cannot be represented: "He is the negation of the world, the negation of your thought" (53). Only when Julian has completely re- nounced all existence and language will he be reabsorbed into the Godhead. Iamblicus's teachings are significant because they fill Julian with the will to power while negating the nonliteral dimension intrinsic to symbolic language. Iamblicus empties Julian of the "in-betweenness" of symbolic know- ledge by insisting that he renounce the body or renounce the spirit. Yet Julian cannot simply dismiss the "burden of the body" or renounce language and state that "He is"; rather, Julian desires truth and its lit- eral representation. He desires to go beyond symbolization and to embody the object. He implores Iamblicus to utter the truths of divine existence by giving them literal, linguistic representation: Then Julian cried aloud, and his voice rang in the silence of the night like a cry of mortal pain - "But who then is He? Who is He? Why does He not answer when we call? What is His name? I wish to know Him, to hear Him, to see Him! Why does He run from my thought? Where is He?" (53) Julian cannot allow the earthly pursuit of knowledge and power to crumble away. He demands that meaning be fixed and that ideas, concepts, and beings be properly named. In the tension between the dialectical opposites of the pure spirit and the pure flesh as presented in the novel, the quest to know forces him to reject religious transcen- dence. His faith in the spirit is not strong enough to renounce the flesh and to affirm, as Iamblicus advises, that "He is"; rather, the novel is the story of how Juliím acquires the strength to say "He is not" and to affirm the will to power of the self as god. The will to power grows in Julian to the point that he can no longer accept the transcendent nature of a reality beyond objects. Having rejected as a youth the God of the Galileans, Julian as emperor rejects the gods of the pagans. His final actions commit the sin of the prosopopoeiac act by taking a metaphor literally and transforming him- self into the symbol or sign emptied of all transcendence: I swear by the eternal joy, locked here, in my heart, I renounce you, as you have renounced me! I abandon you as you have abandoned me, blessed, impotent ones! I am alone against you, phantom Olympians. [I am like unto you, but not your equal, because I am a man and you are only gods! . . . Long, long has my heart aspired to this deliverance; and now I break our alliance, laugh at my superstitious terrors, at your child- ish oracles. 1 was living like a slave, and I might have died a slave! I understand that I am stronger them the gods, because, vowed to death,</page><page sequence="12">162 Glenn A. Davis I have conquered death! No melancholy, no fear, no victims, no prayer! All that is past. . . . Mine be the cloudless sky in which you have dwelt till now, and from which you have died, to give place to man-gods!] (308)" Julian's self-transformation into the man-god kills all transcendence as he renounces the gods and their realm. Heinrich A. Stammler has suggested that there is an element of the gnostic impulse in this, that there is an effort to obtain a definite knowl- edge as the means for the attainment of certain salvation within history (129).12 Transcendence leaves Julian apprehensive. His claim is to- ward certainty within the historical realm; his desire is to stand above all by harnessing the historical process. The quest for certainty and the knowledge of historical immanence deny the religious function of lan- guage, the idea that knowledge and experience are articulated only indirectly, often by means of symbol and metaphor. Self-deification expedites the escape from ambiguity and doubt. Julian's final scene in the novel reveals the extent to which his quest for power has left him open to untruth. As he leads his imperial troops to war, he declares that he will oppose the oracles since there is noth- ing "more divine than the will of man" (297). The power of the ego and the tug of self-divinity compel Julian to denounce fear ("Humans are afraid, not gods" [314]). But this self-divinization destroys him as he leaves himself open to deception. A Persian spy, Artaban, recognizes the extent of Julian's conceit and easily deceives him with flattery: "'It is terrifying, yet sweet to look into your eyes,' continued Artaban. 'Here your face is like the face of a god. No one else knows this. I, I alone know who you are'" (315). Julian's will to power leaves him weaker and vulnerable to false adulation. He rejoices as his troops grow increas- ingly terrified, and he insists that only through terror may they conquer and become god-like as he is. In this world there is no room for both gods and humans; there is no room for divine mysteries. In his final days Julian unexpectedly encounters Arsinoé who deliv- ers the message of the synthesis of the two truths, of Hellenic and Christian: Did not the sages of the Hellenic world come close to what He spoke about? Those, who in the desert torment their flesh and soul, they are far from the gentle Son of Mary. He loved children and freedom, the joy of feasts, and the white lilies. He loved life, Julian! Only we have left Him, have become confused and our souls have become darkened. They all call you Apostate. But they themselves are the Apostates. (324) Arsinoé concludes that a synthesis between the two realms is still pos-</page><page sequence="13">Merezhkovskii's The Death of the Gods i63 sible, but only if the followers of "historical Christianity" recognize that they have distorted Christ's meaning.13 Having reexamined the Christ- ian view of life, Arsinoé has determined that it must be the purpose of the artist to fashion the new symbols of the synthesis. In the final scene of the novel she is carving a wax figure, representing the recon- ciliation of the Dionysian "inexorable and terrible" with Christian "mercy and meekness." Is this artistic work not a contradiction? Will it be understood? she is asked. According to Arsinoé, the character who has accepted the mystery of existence, these questions are not pertinent. It is her statue and the mystery of the image, not Julian's will to power, which embody Merezhkovskii's idea that "symbols express the limit- less part of thought." In this article I have attempted to analyze symbolism and belief in Merezhkovskii's The Death of the Gods. Commenting on the ideologi- cal purpose of the novel, C. Harold Bedford suggests that the writer wanted "to show the clash of Christianity and paganism in the past, to reveal why attempts at reconciliation were failures, and ultimately to provide an arena wherein [he] could thresh out the problem for himself and then present his panacea for it" (65). Yet, as I have attempted to show, this ideological design thwarted the author's attempts to revive symbolic literature. The Emperor Julian, as the personification of the Nietzschean will to power, is effectively closed off from symbolic un- derstanding because his desire for a single truth outweighs the tension of the plurality of truths put forth in the novel. Julian cannot, as Arsinoé does at the end, simply shrug his shoulders and accept the mystery of living in the "in-between." His overwhelming fear of the unknown compels him to seek escape from mundane existence by becoming the man-god. As Edith W. Clowes has concluded, Merezhkovskii's "myth appears pointedly unmystic and even positivist in its epic, historicist bent and its obvious concern for historical fact He sees in events a pattern and a play of superhuman forces that can be rationally known, understood, and predicted" (123). Writing in the latter years of the nineteenth century, Merezhkovskii saw in Julian the representation of an historical figure whose spiritual struggle could prove instructive in Russia's own spiritless times. But despite the fact that Merezhkovskii's works would directly support and promote a religious revival in Russian arts and letters, he himself al- ways remained distant from the Church, an institution which he saw as inhabiting a completely different world. As Zinaida Gippius stated, "We [the Merezhkovskiis and the Church] belonged in truth to different camps We seemed to represent two distinct cultures" (qtd. Zernov 95-96). This was due significantly to the fact that the writer believed</page><page sequence="14">164 Glenn A. Davis that the Church, or what he termed "historic Christianity/' had sepa- rated earth from heaven, flesh from spirit, and had accepted only the divine aspect of Christ. like Emperor Julian, Merezhkovskii through- out his life sought the absolute religious truth. That quest, however, did not successfully accommodate the symbolism upon which his writ- ings were constructed. At first what he believed he had found in Julian, the superman, was the solution to the duality. But a reading of The Death of the Gods demonstrates that the triumph of the Nietzschean ideal proved to be an incomplete answer, for it closed the world off from symbolic transcendence. Lubbock, Texas NOTES Tarts two and three of Christ and Antichrist are The Resurrection of the Gods: Leonardo da Vinci (1901) and Antichrist: Peter and Alexis (1905). 2See the works of Clowes, Rosenthal, and Stammler. 3Rosenthal in Dmitri Sergeevich Merezhkovsky and the Silver Age (62) notes that Merezhkovskii had originally titled the novel Julian the Outcast (Julian Otverzhennyi). At that time (1890s) he did not see Julian as being apostate ( otstupnik ). Only later, after becoming more critical of Nietzsche, would Merezhkovskii change the title (and expurgate the text). 4As Lash has argued, If we are to apprehend the truth which metaphor expresses, we must first deny its literal truth" (129). Recently Miller has ex- pounded upon the limitations of any literalist reading. Through his analysis of the Pygmalion myth and its trope of prosopoeia, the metaphoric enlivening of something that is dead or inanimate, he concludes that the taking of a figure of speech literally is laden with guilt and error, precisely because it is art conceal- ing its art (8). 5Cassedy is quoting Simeon the Great. Although he does not discuss Merezhkovskii, Cassedy does flesh out the theological roots of the literary theo- ries of several of Merezhkovskii's symbolist contemporaries, including Vladimir Solov'ev and Andrei Belyi. 6This definition of idolatry is found in Pelikan (91). 7A11 quotations from The Death of the Gods are taken from the 1973 reprint of the work. Translations are my own, although I have referred to the Trench translation throughout. 8Clowes's analysis approaches what I am suggesting when she writes that Julian's neopaganism is a "tired reenactment of past grandeur" and that "for all its grimness, Christian art has greater power and moral weight in the novel" (125). 9This scene is actually based on a real event in Julian's life. According to Smith, the conversion took place circa 354 in the city of New Ilium, the site of ancient Troy (97). By Julian's own account it was indeed his gazing upon the ancient pagan statues which prompted his conversion.</page><page sequence="15">Merezhkovskii's The Death of the Gods i65 10Wright defines symbolism as "a rebellion against the limitations of nine- teenth-century positivism and its denial of the realm of mystery" (149). uThis extended passage within brackets was excised from the edition of the novel contained in the 1914 collected works ( Polnoe sobranie sochinenii). It is included in Trench's translation (364) published in 1901. 12"Gnostic" here is limited to the meaning of "knowledge with a claim to certainty." The ancient gnostics tended toward the apolitical and rejected life in this world in favor of escape from it However, there is a sense of continuity between ancient gnostic faith and modern political ideologies - namely, "the common feature of a claim to absolute knowledge in the form of gnosis and to power deriving from that knowledge" (Webb 201).
