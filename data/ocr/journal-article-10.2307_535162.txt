<plain_text><page sequence="1">LEWIS SPENCE, An Introduction to Mythology. New York, Moffat, Yard, &amp; Co., 1921. THE elementary student of mythology has been looking for a brief sum- mary of theories relating to the science. Mr. Spence, after giving the ne- cessary definitions for " myth," "mythology," "folk-lore," "folk-tale," and "legend," gives a brief resume of the theories of myth-critics, from Xeno- phanes (fl. 540-500 B.C.) to the more modern investigators, Gomme, Hart- land, Harris, and Elliot Smith. But to the American student especially, it has been a keen disappointment to find, after careful search, not a single reference to the American school of mythologists. This is the more sur- prising, since Spence professes to embrace the eclectic system of myth- elucidation, and declaims, "Let no method, linguistic, solar, anthropologi- cal, dominate our conclusions, but let none be absent from our counsels." Furthermore, the author apparently has not made use of the more recent and abundant myth-material published by the American Folk-Lore Society,</page><page sequence="2">Reviews. 333 the American Museum of Natural History, the Bureau of American Eth- nology, the Field Museum of Chicago, the University of California, and others. At any rate, certain inaccuracies--such as classifying Yetl as the thunder-bird of the Tlingit (Athaspascan), regarding the Chinook as representative of the Northwest coast, and attempting to define "the American myth-system" - might have been avoided had he considered some of these sources; for, even though he ignores the American theorists, perhaps because he feels investigations of particular mythologies to be of less value than comparative works, he might with profit peruse the original tales, and derive at least a feeling for the myth-areas of North America, especially when attempting comparative tables for classification. He does not pretend that these tables are exhaustive, and they need not be; but we object to the errors in the few instances he has used. In general, Mr. Spence is indefinite as to sources. Even in his chapter on " Written Sources of Myth," it is not quite clear whether he includes available written sources, or whether he means literature in the narrower sense; i.e., mythology writ- ten and worked over into a unified composition. If the latter interpreta- tion is to be assumed, he may be correct in classifying Charles G. Leland's " Kuloskap the Master" with the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Popol Vuh, etc.; but if he intends to give a guide to the North American myths in their original forms, he has chosen a recorder whose bane it is "that the pride of some one theory is strong in him," and a mythological record strongly flavored with sophistication and notably inexact. However, had he appended a bibli- ography, - which is indispensable, particularly for an elementary book, - his meaning would be clear, and this criticism undeserved. Since Spence defines mythology as "the study of a primitive or early form of religion while it was a living faith," his main thesis centres about the evolution of the gods, types of deity, man's relation to the supernatural and to the life after death, and ritual. He concludes that man endowed the gods with such qualities as he desired in them (e.g., when man became ethical and moral, his gods took on these attributes); that the gods which were solar, animistic, or economistic became departmental in type (e.g., corn-spirit or maize-spirit, sun-spirit, etc., - grain or sun personified, - took on sanctified human characters as well as superhuman powers); that the religious evolution of man, as evidenced by creation myths, has followed similar lines in all parts of the habitable globe; that the notion of paradise and punishment is greatly affected, not only by the natural environment of a people, but also by the ethical ideas which they have evolved; and, finally, that myth which is an outgrowth of ritual is purely secondary, but that primary ritual myth must have preceded ritual. We shall not attempt to discuss the first, second, and fourth of these conclusions; but we venture a suggestion regarding the unity of religious evolution. Resemblances in creation myths in regions excessively remote may point to unity of religious development; but it is not conclusive to base an argument upon such an insignificant portion of a subject as inclusive as religion, when it has been detached from the rest of its setting. For example, the idea of a god finding himself in a primeval abyss is common to some North American Indians and to the Hebrews. The San Carlos Apache creator, finding himself so placed, made the earth by removing some of the cuticle from his breast and kneading it; the Hebrew god, by the</page><page sequence="3">334 Journal of American Folk-Lore. spoken word. In spite of the similarity of the original placing of the gods, the rest of the myth is totally divergent. If religious evolution is unified, we might expect approximately the same fundamentals in these two widely separated areas; but we find nature-worship among the Apache, and mono- theistic anthropomorphism among the Hebrews. We have here an argu- ment for the study of religion or mythology in toto, also for the detailed study of particular mythologies. With reference to precedence of ritual or myth, we propose a question: How could man create an elaborate and detailed myth, such as those which accompany the Pawnee bundle rituals or the Blackfoot sun-dance, out of occurrences which never came within the limits of his experience? This question must be answered satisfactorily before myth-priority can be es- tablished. It seems to me it would be more reasonable to regard myth and ritual, not as cause and effect, but as phenomena growing simultane- ously with reciprocal influence. From what has been said, it may be deduced, then, that Spence uses the comparative method, and that re-enforced by not too many or exhaustive examples, and not particularly limited by a knowledge of facts. Refer- ences to African, Polynesian, and Australian myths are very brief. We have a feeling, too, that his discussions trail off into vagueness or nothing- ness just when we expect him to make a point. The discussion of Wind- Gods is an example, as is the chapter on "Various Classes of Myth." The volume is an attempt to review mythic science from its beginnings to the present time. The author has succeeded in giving a summary of some theories; in presenting a list of definitions some of which, particularly those for myth and folk-tale, cannot be universally accepted; in classifying deities within the bounds of his definition; and in giving a superficial smat- tering of some of the mythic systems of the world. He has omitted much source material and theory that might alter his conclusions; has general- ized from limited information; and has neglected the portion of his work which would prove most helpful to the student of mythic science, namely, a bibliography.
