As much as this  essay examines the wide range of scholarly interests surrounding Maus, it also  highlights the problem of repetitive concentration on certain themes that domi- nates and restricts discussion on the text. Th is overview of Maus criticism thus  not only provides a useful summary of the studies currently available, but also  serves as a suggestive guide for future scholars in their attempts to broaden and  enrich the fi eld with an eye on expanding the critical discourse. Th e growing popularity of the study of the graphic narrative as a critical liter- ary exercise is visible in both university classrooms and many other academic  venues. As evidence of this, at least three literary journals,1 plus this special  Jewish comics issue of Shofar, have devoted issues to graphic narratives. Scott  McCloud, one of the leading critics in comics studies, was a keynote speaker  at the 2008 International Conference on Narrative.

Indeed, Maus has proven to be a seminal text in graphic  narrative studies and has been taught in many undergraduate and graduate  courses worldwide. More than twenty years since its publication, Maus con- tinues to draw much scholarly attention, including the two most recent critical  pieces by Paul Eakin3 and Tal Bruttmann4 in 2009. Th is enthusiasm for Maus  is likely to continue with the upcoming publication of Meta Maus, a book with  a DVD about the making of Maus. Th e critical success of Meta Maus, how- ever, will largely depend on how eff ectively this project reshapes and further  reinforces one’s reading of Spiegelman’s graphic text. Th e critical space Maus occupies in graphic narrative criticism is crucial  not only because it had won a 1992 Pulitzer Prize—specifi cally, for Special  Awards and Citations–Letters—but also because it is so richly textured, both  at the formal and thematic levels. As the confusion surrounding the genre  placement of Maus suggests—is it a memoir, a testimony, or an autobiogra- phy?—its constructed hybridity becomes a central question. Maus is about a  Holocaust survivor, Vladek, who lived through the concentration camps at  Auschwitz and is still bound by what he witnessed and experienced. But it  is also about a survivor of another sort, Vladek’s son, Artie, who struggles to  fi nd his way into his father’s Holocaust memory that has become a signifi - cant part of the family history. Artie, as a second-generation survivor of the  Holocaust, is burdened with the fallout of the historical event while not hav- ing encountered it fi rsthand. As much as Maus is about a representation of  the Holocaust, it is also about a story of one family whose image is refl ected  through this historical representation. Th e text is a historical document based  on testimony and facts, but it is also an autobiographical creation of the author,  who artistically projects himself onto one of the narrators, Artie, in the text.  Most interestingly, however, Maus interweaves all these thematic complexities  within a hybrid form of the visual and the verbal. Although the scholarly dis- course on Maus over the past eighteen years does reveal a wide range of critical  interests, a strong (and almost repetitive) concentration on certain themes— 3“Eye and I: Negotiating Distance in Eyewitness Narrative,” Journal of Literature and  the History of Ideas, Vol. 7, No. 2 (2009): 201–212. 4“Th e Holocaust through Comic Books,” in Aukje Kluge and Benn E.

More  specifi cally, Maus criticism is sorely lacking in substantial examinations on is- sues surrounding gender, race, religion, and critical pedagogy.7 Scholars, thus,  need to pay more attention to ways of re-discovering the text through these  underdeveloped or overlooked critical approaches. Alternatively, however,  some of the critics who have written on Maus attempt innovations through  the intersections of more than one theme—e.g., trauma, postmemory, and  generational studies; postmemory and photography; ethics of representation  and postmodernism; postmemory, gender, and postmodernism. Such inter- sectional moves toward the text shed deeper light on the thematic hybridity  and complexities of Maus. Another interesting trend to be found in Maus criticism is the extensive  attention paid to Artie, a second-generation survivor, who recounts Vladek’s  own Holocaust testimony as a self-refl exive fi rst-person narrator. Quite a few  studies focusing on postmemory, posthistory, generational transmission, and  ethics of Holocaust representation equally locate Artie at the center of critical  discussions by refl ecting the subject matters on Artie’s postmemory, as op- posed to Vladek’s memory, and Artie’s story-retelling, as opposed to Vladek’s  storytelling. Although it is valuable to explore how history and memory are  passed on to the next generation, it is surprising that little critical attention  has been paid to Vladek’s self-refl exivity as a means of bearing witness and  5See Marianne Hirsch, “Th e Generation of Postmemory,” Poetics Today, Vol. 29, No. 1  (2008): 103–128. Hirsch, who coined the term “postmemory” in the early 1990s, describes  it as a “structure of inter-and trans-generational transmission of traumatic knowledge and  experience” (p. 106). Scholars writing about trauma and generational transmission in Maus  frequently reference Hirsch’s term. 6See James E. Young, “Th e Holocaust as Vicarious Past: Art Spiegelman’s Maus and  Afterimages of History,” Critical Inquiry, Vol. 24, No. 3 (1998): 66–100. Young defi nes  “posthistory” as contextualized within the present temporal frame having a continuing force  to reshape present conditions. Th e Holocaust in Maus as posthistory, for instance, is con- temporaneous in Artie and Vladek’s today and infl uences their present selves. 7Th ere are, however, two notable examples of the teaching of Maus. Monica Wood in  12 Multicultural Novels: Reading and Teaching Strategies (Portland, ME: J. Weston Walch,  1997) introduces Art Spiegelman’s Maus as an ideal teaching tool for exposing students “to  the story of the Holocaust, but also for showing them the breathtaking power of storytell- ing” (p. 86). Jeff  Adams also studies Speigelman’s Maus as a pedagogical tool for recounting  social trauma along with works by Nakazawa and Sebald in “Th e Pedagogy of the Image  Texts,” Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education, Vol. 29, No. 1 (2008): 35–49.

Th e tedious repetitions  and recycling of the same thematic approaches may be hard to avoid in Maus  scholarship, yet critics need to free themselves from the already established  critical discourse and look at the graphic novel anew. Th e time is right for  scholars to draw more attention to some of the underdeveloped readings of  Maus, and what can be relearned and rediscovered from Vladek’s fi rsthand  storytelling of the historical event. Th is bibliographic essay serves as a broad  survey of Maus criticism based on ten thematic categories. It examines and  reevaluates the body of Maus scholarship, articulating trends and tendencies,  with an eye on expanding the critical discourse.  Trauma, Postmemory, and Generational Transmission  Trauma, postmemory, and generational transmission of the Holocaust are  the three topics that intersect most frequently in Maus criticism. Michael  Rothberg,8 for example, raises questions about postmodern representations  of the Holocaust trauma and history, and he does so within the framework of  Hirsch’s notions of postmemory, expanded to include culture at large. Roth- berg’s chapter initially suggests that there is a potentially obscene quality to  “making images and ultimately commodities out of the Holocaust.”9 However,  he points to Spiegelman’s use of serialization, direct address, and subversion  of genres to support his claim that the author reinserts the Holocaust into the  political domain by highlighting its necessary “imbrications into the [today’s]  public sphere and in commodity production.”10 Rothberg’s take on the formal  qualities of Maus eff ectively brings together issues of representation both at  the aesthetic and thematic levels, and he makes clear the challenges and formal  complexities surrounding Holocaust representation. Th e critical discourse focusing on trauma, postmemory, and generational  transmission often aims to reevaluate the impact that the Holocaust has upon  the second generation of the historical event. Th is approach, as Martia Grim- wood11 emphasizes in her study on the second Holocaust generation, suggests  8Michael Rothberg. “Reading Jewish: Philip Roth, Art Spiegelman, and Holocaust  Postmemory,” in Traumatic Realism: Th e Demands of Holocaust Representation (Minneapo- lis: University of Minnesota Press, 2000), pp. 187–220.  9Rothberg, “Reading Jewish,” p. 188. 10Rothberg, “Reading Jewish,” p. 206. 11Marita Grimwood, “Th e Graphic Memoir: Art Spiegelman’s Maus: A Survivor’s  Tale,” in Holocaust Literature of the Second Generation (New York: Palgrave MacMillan,  2007), pp. 63–82.

Marianne Hirsch12 in her 2008 article takes a similar approach  to depictions of the Holocaust and its impact on the present time. More spe- cifi cally, she examines the role of photography in Holocaust representations as  a medium for “inter-and trans-generational transmission of traumatic knowl- edge and experience.”13 Hirsch especially highlights the symbolic and mimetic  power of photography and the past that it captures. In her discussion on the  use of intercalated family photos in Maus, for instance, Hirsch contends that  the pictures of Artie’s diseased mother, his brother Richieu (whom he has  never met), and Vladek in his concentration camp uniform indicate that the  Holocaust is not merely an historical event with fi gures from an unfamiliar  past. More important, she adds, it is Artie’s present desire for safety, belonging,  and familial continuity that are unsettled in his postmemory, and the symbolic  and mimetic dimensions of the photographs allude to this threat.  Autobiography Autobiographical readings are common in Maus criticism. Most critics pay  attention to the ways in which the author mediates—formally and thematical- ly—the interplay between Vladek’s fi rst-person testimony and Artie’s self-re- fl exive fi rst-person narration to create his own autobiographical self.14 Victoria  Elmwood,15 for instance, explicates the presence of the author in the text by  contextualizing the novel through Art Spiegelman, exploring the construction  of his autobiographical self as connected to Vladek’s Holocaust memory. She is  12Ever since coining the term “postmemory” in the early 1990s, Hirsch has specifi - cally examined how photography contributes to the construction of postmemory.

As evidence of this, she  illustrates the various ways Artie as the author constantly revises and reinter- prets the experience that Vladek tells. Th rough Artie’s reshaping of Vladek’s  testimony, his father’s Holocaust experience is incorporated into Artie’s “post- Holocaust” experience and thereby intensifi ed by the sense of isolation and  loss within his family. Elmwood concludes by highlighting Spiegelman’s suc- cess in creating a space for himself in the family through postmemory, and  argues that this space becomes a site for his artistic “projection, investment,  and creation.”17 Th is space where Spiegelman projects, invests, and (re)creates  his father’s stories and those he himself gathers through photos, interviews,  and dairies facilitates not only the creation of his autobiographical self, but his  artistic experiments as a comics artist as well. Much as does Elmwood, Candida Rifkind18 particularizes the type of au- tobiography that Maus depicts through the concepts of trauma, postmemory,  and generational transmission. Primarily, Rifkind focuses on the dynamics  in the father and son relationship and highlights the collaboration between  Vladek and Artie as it relates to the construction of Spiegelman’s autobio- graphical self. What this intergenerational collaboration ultimately encour- ages, Rifkind adds, is the reconciliations between the father and son, past and  present, and public and private, which taken together call for the productive  portrayal of the Holocaust within the present. Rifkind is especially eloquent  in explaining how the “collaborative tensions” created by the “emotional en- tanglement” between Vladek and Artie blur the two narrations, and instead  construct layers of narratives that are transgressive and fl uid.19 Th is multi-lay- ered structure, in turn, produces the multiple selves of Art Spiegelman—e.g.,  the Holocaust historian, the artist, and the son—in the text. Rifkind’s work  also provides a useful narratological reading of the text, especially because she  devotes a great deal of her discussion to the ways in which the generational  16Elmwood, “‘Happy, Happy, Ever After,’” p. 691. 17Elmwood, “‘Happy, Happy, Ever After,’” p. 694. 18Candida Rifkind, “Drawn from Memory: Comics Artists and Intergenerational  Auto/biography,” Canadian Review of American Studies, Vol. 38, No. 3 (2008): 399–427. 19Rifkind, “Drawn from Memory,” p. 402.

History/Posthistory Maus, as a graphic narrative inspired by and/or based on the Holocaust, in- evitably faces critical questions regarding how to justify and validate fi ctional  representations of factual history.20 Th e critical conversation on Maus, how- ever, productively emerges within and against this complexity of historical  representation, as critics have explored various ways to reshape and reevalu- ate the Holocaust in Maus through its intersections with personal memories  in a form of Hirsch’s “postmemory.” For example, James E. Young reexamines  Spiegelman’s use of graphic narrative in Maus and praises it as a medium that  challenges the redemptory potential of historical interpretation.21 Young’s  project primarily focuses on clarifying and re-conceptualizing the Holocaust  in Maus as history under the present condition, rather than an event that hap- pened in the past. Th is re-understanding of the Holocaust is informed mainly  by the “comix”22 medium that eff ectively portrays Artie’s relation to his father’s  history. In short, this narrative choice invites Artie to explore the alienating  gap between the experiential knowledge of the fi rst generation and the sec- ondhand discovery of the later generation through a constructed spatiality  and temporality. As Maus, through its formal elements, openly experiments  with the discrepancy between history and its present interpretation within  a textual space, the Holocaust serves as a means by which to recapture past  events within the present temporal frame as “posthistory” without compro- mising or redeeming what had happened. Historical representation in Maus,  then, provides room for Artie to articulate his relationship to the Holocaust  as mediated through his father’s memory, something reinterpreted within his  own present time and space. 20Th e Ethics of History (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 2004), edited  by David Carr, Th omas Flynn, and Rudolf Makkreel, provides an excellent overview on the  ethical issues involved in the literary representation of history. 21James E. Young, “Th e Holocaust as Vicarious Past: Art Spiegelman’s Maus and Af- terimages of History,” Critical Inquiry, Vol. 24, No. 3 (1998): 66–100.  22In his essay, James E. Young uses this term to emphasize the “commixture” of image  and narrative in Maus. Th is is slightly diff erent from, although related to, the use of “comix”  when referring to the underground (and at times violent and sexually explicit) comic books  of the late 1960s and 1970s. Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies RET RA CTE D </page> <page sequence="9">  A Bibliographic Essay ♦ 153 Michael Staub,23 on the other hand, proposes to relocate Maus in the  same lineage as Zora Neal Hurston’s Mules and Men and other books of re- membering by focusing on its orality, a narrative mode representative of cer- tain ethnic groups’ experiences and perspectives. Staub problematizes the Ho- locaust’s frequent inclusion in offi  cial history, and asserts that the Holocaust  as offi  cial event marginalizes and even denies individual memories central to  Maus.24 For instance, he examines the Holocaust in its relation to the family  history to which Artie hopes to relate, and he acknowledges Vladek’s personal  voice as the valid representation of the historical event that Vladek, as an in- dividual, went through. Staub ultimately argues that Maus is really about an  understanding of what it means to have a Jewish identity in a post-Auschwitz  age through one man’s unique Holocaust experience. However, Staub hardly  elaborates on, or even complicates, what he means by “Jewish identity” and  the unique “Jewish experience” that Vladek’s voice revives. Also, his discussion  does not contextualize Artie’s role as a second narrator who collaborates with  Vladek’s storytelling, and thus Staub fails to fully discuss the text as a whole.  As a consequence, he weakens his own arguments surrounding orality as a  central creative force in Maus. Amy Hungerford25 places Maus within a larger cultural project to contest  Berel Lang’s argument about literary representation of history as a violation of  facts and a mechanism that silences what happened in the past. Interestingly,  however, even though Hungerford refuses to treat Maus as a mere refl ection of  historical facts, her discussion foregrounds the use of documents and records  to which Spiegelman refers. In other words, she follows the conventional way  historians explore history to construct her own argument. For instance, Hun- gerford takes on an archival research on the cultural and historical contexts  within which Maus is situated. She argues that Spiegelman’s drawing of the  Holocaust through some of the deliberate graphic options in these particular  contexts shows how closely the text is committed to the historical facts of the  Shoah. Specifi cally, Hungerford discusses the representation of Jews as mice,  23Michael E.

She also pays close attention to the occasional  use of photographs in Maus and explains, in an argument similar to that of  Marianne Hirsch, that this use of photographs adds a sense of realism—while  also mitigating against fi ctionality—that the cartoony fi gures of the text seem  to lack. Hungerford further highlights the type of family history that Spiegel- man portrays to better understand the larger picture of the Maus project. She  ultimately draws a seemingly simple yet neat conclusion that the creation of  Maus itself was inspired by family history, not merely by the author’s creativ- ity and imagination. As a consequence, Hungerford succeeds in extending the  notion of offi  cial history to the individual/familial level, thereby complement- ing James E. Young’s earlier work on the relations of history, the present, and  personal memory that together frame the concept of posthistory. Ethics of Representation A member of the second Holocaust generation, Artie assumes a central role  in presenting the historical event in Maus. Not only does he listen to Vladek’s  fi rsthand storytelling, but he also mediates the narrative as he understands it  in the course of the text. Th is particular mode of representation used in Maus  evokes questions of ethics. Most critics, however, complicate and enrich these  issues surrounding ethics by focusing on the trauma generationally transmit- ted to Artie and its impact on his understanding of his and Vladek’s lives.  Emily Budick,26 on the other hand, critically accuses Artie of what she calls  a “forced confession.” She characterizes as confrontational the narrative rela- tionship between Artie and Vladek and points to Vladek’s reluctance to share  his private memory, which the tension between Artie’s and Vladek’s narrations  illustrates. Budick argues that Artie violates his promise to keep Vladek’s tes- timony personal by turning Vladek’s private memory into a public text. She  thus contends that Vladek is “re-traumatized” by Artie’s violation. Th e core  of Budick’s criticism lies in the unresolved past within this confrontational  tension between the older and younger generations. Nevertheless, Budick vali- dates Artie’s “violation” and “failure” to some degree in her concluding remarks  and suggests that it is not the fi xed truth of reality that today’s Holocaust rep- resentation reveals, but rather, the condition by which “we process our knowl- edge of whatever reality we possess.”27  26Emily Budick, “Forced Confessions: Th e Case of Art Spiegelman’s Maus,” Proof- texts, Vol. 21, No. 3 (2001): 379–98.  27Budick, “Forced Confessions,” p. 396.

In her book  devoted to the work of Th omas Pynchon, Walter Abish, Don DeLillo, and  Art Spiegelman, Orban studies what she calls an “ethical turn” elaborated in  their work. Th e chapter on Maus introduces the concept of monster/mon- strosity to allude to Spiegelman’s anthropomorphic metaphor as well as the  simultaneous appeal and repulsion of both his text and his subject matter.  Orban argues, similarly to many other critics, that Maus’ apparent ethical  violations are in fact self-refl exive foregrounding maneuvers. She also gives  a lengthy analysis and pays special attention to the question of responsibility,  or as she puts it, the “emphasis on [today’s] response [to the past memories] as  responsibility.”29 Th is emphasis, she argues, complicates, if not undermines, the  work of memory as a solitary project. Critics like Gillian Banner and Richard Glejzer diff erentiate Spiegelman’s  project in Maus from a simple mirror refl ection of history and highlight its  unique storytelling mode, graphic narrative. Most importantly, both Banner  and Glejzer aim to reevaluate the ethical dimensions of the text within this  formal context. For example, Banner30 seems primarily concerned with dem- onstrating the challenges Spiegelman faces given his historical distance from  the Holocaust itself, as well as the ways in which the narrative structure, the  medium, and the relationships between characters make Spiegelman’s narra- tive comparable to, or at least as worthy of attention as, survivor testimonies.  Glejzer,31 on the other hand, draws on Jacques Lacan, Dominick LaCapra, and  James E. Young to refl ect on the inescapability of the forgotten in memory.  He suggests that Maus thematizes the diff erence between testimony as telling  and witnessing as seeing, and that comics as a medium visualizes the interplay  between the two, while at the same time acknowledging that “in the face of  testimony . . . the original trauma of seeing insists.”32  28Katalin Orban, “‘Mauschwitz’: Monsters, Memory, and Testimony,” in Ethical Di- versions: Post-Holocaust Narratives of Pynchon, Abish, DeLillo, and Spiegelman (New York:  Routledge, 2005), pp. 35–74. 29Orban, “‘Mauschwitz,’” p. 69. 30Gillian Banner, “Art Spiegelman,” in Holocaust Literature: Schulz, Levi, Spiegelman,  and the Memory of the Off ence (London:Valentine Mitchell, 2000), pp. 23–45. 31Richard Glejzer, “Maus and the Epistemology of Witness,” in Michael Bernard- Donals and Richard Glejzer, eds., Witnessing the Disaster: Essays on Representation and the  Holocaust (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2003), pp. 125–139. 32Glejzer, “Maus and the Epistemology of Witness,” p. 137.

For instance, he explores the use of mimesis  both at the levels of content—Artie’s approach toward Vladek’s trauma with  his own mimetic affi  nity—and form—the mice-and-cats representation of  the Holocaust as a distancing mechanism that cautions against the stereotyp- ing of certain ethnic groups. Huyssen posits that this mimetic approach to  the novel evokes self-refl exivity and ironies, consequently guiding the reader  beyond a reductive mirror refl ection of the past. Huyssen also asserts that  through the use of mimesis, Maus proposes multi-dimensional ways to refl ect  on the re-representation of the Holocaust. Th e mimetic approach to the his- torical events in Maus, he adds, negates construction of the Holocaust canon  based on any limiting aesthetic categories. In concluding his remarks, Huys- sen argues that mimesis in Maus acknowledges and celebrates the productive  distance privileged by today’s re-interpretation of the Holocaust. Postmodernism Th e postmodern approach to Maus examines how the text, with its formal  and thematic innovations, suggests new ways of reading the Holocaust within  the context of self-refl exivity and metafi ctionality. Daniel Schwarz, in his 1999  article, “Th e Comic Grotesque of Spiegelman’s Maus,”34 is one of the earliest  critics using this postmodern frame. In this piece, Schwarz identifi es Maus as  a postmodern text that, in its use of playful and innovative discourse, breaks  with many traditional forms of Holocaust narratives. Schwarz’s most consis- tent claim seems to be an implicit response to questions he poses in his book’s  introduction. He posits there that modernism is uncomfortably aligned with  Nazi language, and in classifying Spiegelman’s text as postmodern, he suggests  that it provides an alternative to more conventional narrative forms. His chap- ter on Maus in particular—interestingly grouped in the “Fantasy” section of the  book as opposed to the sections “Memoirs,” “Realism,” or “Myth, Parable, and  Fable”—details the ways some of Maus’ most striking images eff ect in readers  33Andreas Huyssen, “Of Mice and Mimesis: Reading Spiegelman with Adorno,” New  German Critique, Vol. 81, No. 3 (2000): 65–82.  34Daniel Schwarz, “Th e Comic Grotesque of Spiegelman’s Maus,” in Imagining the Ho- locaust (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1999), pp. 287–302.

Arlene Wilner36 takes a similar approach to the postmodern impulse in  Maus. Specifi cally, she is concerned with how the postmodern formal experi- ments in Maus make more vivid the diffi  culties and complexities of Holocaust  representations. She extensively examines such elements as the text’s seven  ironic juxtapositions and tensions among the characters, its visual illustra- tions, and its panel displays to illuminate the formal strategies of Maus that  challenge any totalizing vision or meaning making of offi  cial history. Wilner  argues that internal consistency and logic are present despite the repeated dis- junctions and tensions at the formal level. Th e postmodern tendency empha- sizes construction through destruction, or formation through the very form- lessness of a text. She adds that comics’ unique form refuses to restrict the  Holocaust within any narrowly defi ned logic of narrative structure. Wilner  is astute in pointing out Spiegelman’s deliberate formal choices in construct- ing his storyworld which mitigate any constraints imposed by the discrepancy  between the Holocaust past and present. Postmodern readings of Maus also  deal with questions of politics when thinking of the Holocaust. For example,  Eric Berlatsky37 addresses what he describes as the problems of representa- tion based on memory, especially for oppressed people in the postmodern era.  He argues that Spiegelman’s work affi  rms the political necessity of personal  memory, in the face of institutional records and Holocaust deniers. However,  he also points out how the author wishes to destabilize memory’s authority  in light of its troubled relationship to both referentiality and power, drawing  on theorizations of history from such critics as Michel de Certeau, Michel  Foucault, and Linda Hutcheon. Berlatsky insists that rather than attempting  to resolve these tensions between personal memory and institutional records  and authorities, Spiegelman foregrounds them through metafi ctional self-re- fl exiveness, and that he seems ultimately unsure of the political utility of his  own text. 35Schwarz, “Th e Comic Grotesque,” p. 302. 36Arlene Fish Wilner, “Happy, Happy Ever After: Story and History in Art Spie- gelman’s Maus,” in Deborah Geis, ed., Considering Maus:Approaches to Art Spiegelman’s  “Survivor’s Tale,” (Birmingham: University of Alabama Press, 2003), pp. 105–21. 37Eric Berlatsky, “Memory as Forgetting: Th e Problem of the Postmodern in Kun- dera’s Th e Book of Laughter and Forgetting and Spiegelman’s Maus,” Cultural Critique, Vol.  55, No. 1 (2003): 101–51.

Hillary Chute’s postmodern argument, in this regard, is  worth noting.38 Citing such critics as Fredric Jameson and Susan Friedman,  Chute stresses that the narrative medium in Maus deserves more attention in  its own right, especially because the spatial features, such as panel arrangement  and gutters, allow Spiegelman to present fl uid temporalities in depicting the  Holocaust within the present temporal frame. What is especially postmodern  about the making of Maus, Chute argues, is how the comics form in Maus  destabilizes the static, and binary-based, temporal structure between past and  present. She concludes that the graphic narrative in Maus makes possible the  “postmodern politics” which refuses “telos and closure.”39  Narratology Narratological readings of Maus are some of the most recent additions to the  scholarship. Th is approach is most interested in how the formal aspects of the  text, the system and construction of the storyworld, further highlights and  complicates the thematics of Maus. Erin McGlothlin,40 for instance, takes a  close look at the interplay between diff erent temporalities within the text by  examining the multi-layered narrative structure embodied in the discourse  between Artie and Vladek. In her essay she explicates the distinction between  story and discourse and focuses on the concept of metalepses.41 More specifi - cally, McGlothlin explains that Maus contains three narrative strands: story  (Vladek’s Holocaust experience), discourse (his retelling of that experience  to Artie), and narrating (Artie’s reshaping of Vladek’s story, and the problems  that occur in a process of framing it into a form of visual narrative). However,  the diff erences among these distinct narrative strands dissolve when Maus is  read in its totality. Th e consequence, she adds, is blurred temporal boundaries  and fl uid transgressions of space within the narrative world.

She argues with critic Hillel Halkin’s assessment that the graphic novel is too  limiting a form for the subject matter in Maus, and she builds on Will Eisner’s  theorization of the medium. Specifi cally, Ewert points to the unique narra- tive functions of the visual elements in Spiegelman’s books: narrative economy  (effi  ciency/use of space) and subtlety (subnarratives); metonymic techniques  (e.g., the use of swastika, chimneys, Stars of David, number tattoos, and the  Red Cross); framing and foregrounding negotiation of verbal/textual tempo- ralities; and issues of unreliability and narrative control. Th e result is a claim  both for the power of visual narrative in Spiegelman’s text and for the sig- nifi cance of narratology in expanding our awareness of and attention to such  visual elements.  Photography and Art  Since the publication of Maus, there has been consistent scholarly interest in  the use of photography in the text and its juxtaposition with cartoony fi gures  and animal imagery. Marianne Hirsch, as previously discussed, is one of the  leading critics invested with this fi eld of criticism. She has specifi cally argued  that the photographs of the diseased fi gures creates in Maus an intercalation,  or a space for postmemory. Andrea Liss is also concerned with this use of  photography in Holocaust representations and its artistic eff ects on public  reception. In her comparative work of Christian Boltanski’s Memorials and  Art Speigelman’s Maus,45 she explores ways to situate personal history within  42McGlothlin, “No Time Like the Present,” p. 194. 43See also McGlothin’s “When Time Stands Still: Traumatic Immediacy and Narra- tive Organization in Art Spiegelman’s Maus and In the Shadow of No Towers,” in Samantha  Baskind and Ranen Omer-Sherman, eds., Th e Jewish Graphic Novel: Critical Approaches  (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2008), pp. 94–110. 44Jeanne Ewert, “Art Spiegelman’s Maus and Graphic Narrative,” in Marie-Laure Ryan,  ed., Narrative Across Media: Th e Languages of Storytelling (Lincoln: University of Nebraska  Press, 2004), pp. 178–94. 45Andrea Liss, “Between Trauma and Nostalgia: Christian Boltanski’s Memorials and  Art Spiegelman’s Maus,” in Trespassing through Shadows: Memory, Photography, and the Ho- locaust (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1998), pp. 39–68.

More specifi cally, she compares and contrasts Boltanski’s photographic  representation of Holocaust victims, exhibited in various art museums, and  Spiegelman’s illustration of Jews, Nazis, and Poles as animals in Maus to shed  light on the artistic recapturing of the subject matter. Th e use of art in both  cases, Liss asserts, challenges and further complicates the divisions between  history and aesthetics, as well as between the public and private. She also  points out that Spiegelman’s approach to the Holocaust, in comics form and  with animal imagery, transforms the historical specifi city into artistic/fi ctional  representation of the Shoah, consequently making the offi  cial history more  accessible to the public. While Boltanski’s photo exhibition of the Holocaust  personalizes the memory of the historical event with heightened realism and  intimacy, Spiegelman’s animal illustrations have an opposite eff ect: it resists  identifi cation with the Holocaust by erasing any particular ethnic characteris- tics and stereotypes. Th is, in turn, makes history more accessible to a broader  audience.46 Liss ultimately contends that the artistic representation of the Ho- locaust—either photographic or pictorial—alters traumatic memory of the  historical event into a shared history of Humanities, evoking even more telling  and lasting eff ects on the viewers. Miles Orvell47 aims to examine Maus as a part of the author’s career experi- ments as a comics artist. In his comparative study of Jay Cantor’s Krazy Kat: A  Novel in Five Panels and Spiegelman’s Maus, Orvell argues that their common  “vitality” of the hybridized form of the visual and verbal, along with the posi- tioning of the subject matter within the historical and psychological contexts,  creates a unique space in the literary marketplace. Specifi cally regarding Maus,  Orvell locates the novel within the larger context of Speigelman’s career and  shows how the content and form of the text refl ect Spiegelman’s artistic evolu- tion toward a middle ground, where the author brings together the opposite  poles of low and high culture. He starts his discussion with Spiegelman’s ac- tive involvement with the underground comix movement of 1960s and 1970s  (low art). He then examines Spiegelman’s founding of the avant-garde comics  46See also Judith Goldstein’s “Realism without a Human Face,” in Margaret Cohen  and Christopher Prendergast, eds., Spectacles of Realism: Body, Gender and Genre (Min- neapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1995), pp. 66–89. 47Miles Orvell, “Writing Posthistorically: Krazy Kat, Maus, and the Contemporary  Fiction Cartoon,” American Literary History, Vol. 4, No. 1 (1992): 110–28.

Finally, Orvell highlights the completion of the Maus project that, ac- cording to his argument, rests in the space between low and high art, especially  with its appeal to both the cartoony images and the world of historical/psy- chological complexity, and thereby gains “a broader based audience.”49 Orvell’s  project of reading Maus within the context of the Spiegelman’s career as a  whole is interesting and worthwhile. However, his distinction between low  and high art is rather out-dated and even arbitrary. Gender Even though few critics have substantively discussed the construction of gen- der in Maus, Nancy Miller50 has nonetheless given this topic considerable at- tention. Her gender-based reading approaches Maus as an autobiographical  text that reinforces the vision of an autobiographical self “connected to a signif- icant other,”51 a tradition widely adopted in many female-authored autobiog- raphies. Miller argues that Spiegelman sets out to tell his father’s story so that  he may ultimately tell his own, which is closely connected and subordinated to  Vladek’s. Miller’s understanding of Maus nicely relates to the history of wom- en’s autobiography, which she examines extensively in her article. Miller ex- plains how, in the tradition of women’s autobiography, the (female) self is often  defi ned as a member of an oppressed social group and identifi ed through her  relationships with privileged others. Spiegelman’s self-portrayal (as Artie) and  his relationships to both his father and Anja, the silenced mother, is reminis- cent of most female-authored autobiographies. Yet, despite her obvious intent  to examine Maus through the silence of the absent mother—thereby situating  it within the tradition of women’s autobiography—Miller ends up discussing  Spiegelman’s storytelling mainly through its connection to Vladek’s story. Th is  brings the reader back to the father-son relationship that many other scholars  have likewise examined. As a consequence, Anja’s silence is neglected despite  Miller’s attempt to foreground it. 48Spiegelman founded Raw with his wife Francoise Mouly. It was also intended as an  art object and was printed on oversize paper in high quality color. It was sold in bookstores  and newsstands rather than in comics stores. 49Orvell, “Writing Posthistorically,” p. 111. 50Nancy Miller, “Representing Others: Gender and Subject of Autobiography,” Diff er- ences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies, Vol. 6, No.1 (1994): 1–28. 51Miller, “Representing Others,” p. 4.

In her contribution to Maus scholarship, Marilyn  Reizbaum52 starts with praise for Spiegelman’s innovative answer to Adorno’s  challenge regarding the impossibility of poetry after Auschwitz. She then goes  on to criticize the issues of self-representation and Jewish identity that arise  in Spiegelman’s work. She proposes that there is an implicit historical concept  of Jewishness in Maus; moreover, it is the one imposed by external categoriza- tions. Reizbaum goes to some length, citing Dori Laub and Shoshana Felman,  to explain the confl icting urge toward and impossibility of witnessing the Ho- locaust, and she relates this to what she sees as Spiegelman’s disguise. Still, she  remains steadfast in her critique, especially when she juxtaposes Maus with a  1993 New Yorker cover by Spiegelman himself.53 Her conclusion is succinctly  stated thus: “Maus reinforces a stereotype, whereas Spiegelman’s New Yorker  image undoes the historical type by localizing it.”54 She questions the greater  reception and the acceptance for Spiegelman’s stereotypes, and she contextual- izes this by discussing the various types of self-representation found among  American and Israeli Jews. Andrew Gordon’s55 approach to Jewish identity is specifi cally focused  within a context of a Jewish father-and-son relationship. Gordon starts his  discussion by briefl y summarizing literary illustrations of Jewish fathers. Th e  fathers in Jewish American fi ction, he examines, often have been portrayed  as pitifully ineff ectual and timid. However, the fathers in Spiegelman’s Maus  and Philip Roth’s Patrimony are diff erent, and Gordon calls each a “mensch.”  Particularly regarding Maus, Gordon considers Vladek a central fi gure of the  novel and investigates the “monumental contradictions”56 in Vladek’s charac- 52Marilyn Reizbaum, “Surviving on Cat and Maus: Art Spiegelman’s Holocaust Tale,”  in Laurence Silberstein, ed., Mapping Jewish Identities (New York: New York University  Press, 2000), pp. 122–44. 53Th is cover illustration of the New Yorker shows Jewish American male and African  American female lovers kissing each other in their very traditional and stereotypical ethnic  attires. 54Reizbaum, “Surviving on Cat and Maus,” p. 128. 55Andrew Gordon, “Philip Roth’s Patrimony and Art Spiegelman’s Maus: Jewish Sons  Remembering Th eir Fathers,” Philip Roth Studies, Vol. 1, No. 1 (2005): 53–66. 56Gordon, “Philip Roth’s Patrimony and Art Spiegelman’s Maus,” p. 58.

As much as Vladek is a survivor, a successful businessman, and a family  man with tremendous courage, he also suff ers from a character disorder and  consequently harasses those closest to him. Th is analysis of Vladek leads Gor- don to suggest that despite some of the negative traits in Vladek’s character,  one can neither hate nor be too judgmental of him, largely due to do the very  stereotypical portrait of Vladek as an old immigrant Jewish father “who speaks  broken English with a Yiddish accent” and struggles within his relationship  with the “neurotic intellectual Jewish American son.”57 Gordon concludes by  asserting that while the fathers in these works are “exposed” and “betrayed”  by their sons, it is what the Jewish American sons have to do “to survive the  survivors.”58 Gordon’s attempt to focalize Jewish identity through the paternal  relationship and the psychological and emotional dimensions involved in it is  both thoughtful and touching. Use of English Even if Vladek’s broken and accented language is often referenced by critics  interested in Jewish identity, there are hardly any studies that pay substantial  attention to the use of English in its own right and examine its multiple func- tions. One critic who does so is Alan Rosen. He examines the use of English  in Maus as he symbolically relates the chosen language to the impossibility  of the Holocaust representation.59 He discusses how English functions as a  means for Vladek’s survival in diff erent situations and at diff erent levels. Rosen  fi rst makes a distinction between the use of English before the liberation and  after the liberation. In Auschwitz, where English is foreign, it functions as a  language of romance (his fi rst encounter with Anja) and survival (in a few oc- casions, Vladek is exempted from the gas chamber due to his ability to speak  and write in English). After the liberation, however, living where English is the  native language, Vladek strives to retell his Holocaust trauma through broken  and unfi tting English. Rosen concludes that Vladek’s use of improper English  after Auschwitz represents the impossibility of (verbally) reviving the Holo- caust memory. He ultimately argues that the use of English as represented on  two diff erent levels—one celebrated as a language of survival and the other chal- 57Gordon, “Philip Roth’s Patrimony and Art Spiegelman’s Maus,” p. 59. 58Gordon, “Philip Roth’s Patrimony and Art Spiegelman’s Maus,” p. 60. 59Alan Rosen, “Th e Language of Survival: English as Metaphor in Art Spiegelman’s  Maus,” Prooftexts, Vol. 15, No.3 (1995): 249–63.

Writing about the Holocaust, one of the most shameful events in history,  has been an overwhelming challenge to writers because of its emotional bag- gage and a sense of responsibility that never seems to be satisfactorily fulfi lled.  Art Spiegelman also confesses his own diffi  culties and challenges in writing  the historical event in his own work: “I feel so inadequate trying to reconstruct  a reality that was worse than my darkest dreams. . . . I mean there’s so much to  understand or visualize. I mean, reality is too complex for comics. . . . So much  has to be left out or distorted.”60 Critics have been welcoming Spiegelman’s at- tempt to “reconstruct a reality” with a wide range of scholarly interests. How- ever, as this bibliographic essay demonstrates, there are still gaps to be fi lled in  Maus scholarship, including those on such issues as gender, narrative form, the  use of English, and critical pedagogy. It is my hope that this overview of Maus  criticism will not only provide a useful summary of the studies currently avail- able, but also serve as a suggestive guide for future scholars in their attempts to  broaden and enrich the fi eld.  60Spiegelman, Maus II, p. 16.
