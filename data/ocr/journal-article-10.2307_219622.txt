<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 537 class is merely asserted rather than explained. The second chapter, which promises to deal with "Capitalism, Underdevelopment and the State," simply re- hashes and serves up the well-known succession of paradigms of development theory: modernization, dependency theory and world-systems analysis, followed by capsule versions of selected Africanist contributions to the underdevelopment debate (Ake, Amin, Leys, Warren, et al.). Chapter 3 ("The Accumulation Program of Nigerian Military Regimes"), which should be pivotal, reads like a freshman's synthesis of well known economic histories of Nigeria. "The Accumulationist State" of Chapter 4 amounts to (very dated) case studies of Volkswagen of Nigeria (VON) and the Nigerian Steel Development Agency (NSDA). To be sure, these studies do reveal important historical aspects of the partnership between the state and capital, both transnational and national; but they do not even begin to address a theory of state accumulation. Chapter 5, on labor control, grossly overestimates the power and potential of the organized working class and its political-economic organizations before focussing on the military government's statutes and subsidiary regulations pertaining to industrial relations as a way of addressing this complex and important topic. The sixth chapter deals with "The Management of Accumulation" principally by describing state economic policies and revenue flows. And the final brief chapter at least attempts-though too superficially-to bring together the concepts of state, accumulation, and peripheral capitalism. This book conjures up a bleak, abstract, and non-specific world without historical actors, concrete policies, or actual sequences of events. The quality of its prose, like the level of its analysis, shifts constantly-presumably reflecting different times of writing or different literatures being discussed. Its $45.00 price tag makes it a questionable investment for Nigeria specialists in the West, and puts it quite out of reach of all but the most affluent Nigerians. WILLIAM D. GRAF University of Guelph SAHARA. International review of prehistory and history of the Sahara. Chief editor Alfred Muzzolini. No. 2 November 1989. Volume II of the multi-disciplinary journal Sahara has increased the number of pages over Volume I by about 25 percent and has added three new departments. Of these, "Pre-Islamic Documents" is merely announced by the editor as an invitation to potential contributors to submit photographs with a brief description of certain types of monuments or of objects found in archaeological excavations which have been customarily labeled "pre-Islamic." The distinction betwee. this class of document and those appropriate for the already existing department of "Prehistoric documents" is not clear. "Writings" is announced by the editor with the appointment of Lionel Galand to direct this department. Galand's statement of purpose outlines the matters to be covered, but this issue does not have a contribution under this rubric. To be welcomed are photos and/or sketches of inscriptions on rock or</page><page sequence="2">538 BOOK REVIEWS other surfaces, discussions of them or of earlier published accounts of such "writings," of which there are three categories: tifinagh (in which the language is known to be Tuareg); libique (found outside the Tuareg country and distinguishable by certain characteristics from tifinagh); and other inscriptions that don't fit these two groups, including some in the Canary Islands. The third new department may have been initiated by the contributor, Patrick Munson, who submitted a critique of a publication by Augustin Holl. It is published neither as a review nor as an article but comes under "Debates." This new department is to be welcomed but one could quibble that this is not a debate in the usual sense. Munson makes stringent criticism of the interpretation put forward by Holl in a 1986 publication on the neolithic economy and society of Dhar Tichit, which differs from one he had earlier proposed. There is no response in this volume from Holl, who however has an article here that carries forward his argumentation in regard to the Tichitt escarpment prehistory. There are eight articles in this issue, with four in English, three in French, and one in Italian. Classification by discipline is not a simple matter because jurisdictional boundaries of disciplines overlap, e.g. archaeologists may include rock art and some other topics as coming within the purview of their field, and en revanche specialists in the study of rock art refer to archaeological literature for context. This caveat noted, three are archaeological, two are on rock art, two are botanical, and one deals with fish bones recovered from Holocene environments. Graham Connah and S.J. Freeth report that there was no local stone in the prehistoric sites on the lagoonal clay savanna near Lake Chad, which creates a "commodity problem" for the inhabitants. Identifying the sources of stone of which implements had been made indicated transport from more than 70 kms and even as much as "at least 200 kms." Edged-tools needed different quality mineral than grindstones. There was some change in preferred sources "over time," but it was possible to determine the sources most exploited. Peter L. Shinnie, excavator of Meroe, gives further discussion to the influence of this center on the Central Sudan with attention to the site of Jebel Moya which seems to have been contemporary with Meroe. Burials there may be of a transhumant people somewhat influenced by Meroitic culture. Alfred Muzzolini discusses a previously unpublished site of rock art in northern Tassili and decides that the previously accepted chronology, which postulated that the Round Heads are entirely earlier than the Bovidian phase, is dubious. August Holl chooses one of three interpretations of the archaeological remains on the Tichitt escarpment in Mauritania and thence proceeds to try to build a "generative model integrating different kinds of interaction between changing environmental patterns and the dynamics of the social systems." One of the interpretations he throws out, in favor of his own, is that of Munson. Inasmuch as Munson has in this very volume attempted to demolish Holl's interpretation, acceptance of this extension will have to await the eventual decision on the "Debate." Wim van Neer investigated Holocene fish remains from the Sahara to contribute to the study of palaeohydrology of the Sahara. In dry periods, fish survive in a "refugium" from which in wetter periods migrations can occur where a water connection exists. He concludes there were such fish migrations thru</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 539 watercourses no longer active today. The specific fish bones found along the Wadi Howar indicate that it once flowed into the Nile. This connection is confirmed by satellite photos. A former water connection between Adrar des Iforhas and the Niger river via the wadi Tilemsi is indicated by fish remains (but apparently not by satellite photos?). Some of the fish bones were found on neolithic sites. Jack Harlan assembles evidence of the importance of wild grass seeds in Saharan and Sudanic diets, not just as something to fall back on in times of food scarcity but as valued at any time. Such seeds were probably harvested since the Epipaleolithic. Three of these were ultimately domesticated. J.-L. Le Quellec reports a rock site discovered in northern Fezzan characterized by depictions of bovines but with a few schematic chariots, as well as large "Ethiopian" fauna, a horse and feline motif, and some anthropomorphic engravings, some of which may be masked or possibly are theromorphs. Vanni Beltrami attacks the problem of Cyranaican silfium, a plant mentioned in classical writings but now extinct, which was used medicinally. Plants still living in Saharan oases which resemble descriptions or images of silfium were examined. The problem is considered in the context of trade, north- south, and east-west. In addition there are three Brief Notes, two brief Documents of Rock Art, ten book reviews, and notices of conferences held or to be held and other matters of interest to readers oriented to the scope of this journal. Inasmuch as one-quarter of the articles are on rock art, to which also a department of brief notices is also devoted, and recognizing that the editor is a prominent specialist in this field, one may expect that this is the place to look for developments in this field. It is a field that is becoming better oganized in associations to promote communication between researchers within Africa and between this region and other continents. The interpretation of any historical import in particular examples of rock art requires awareness of the potential pertinence of data from many disciplines. The importance of these "documents" has long been recognized but the utilization for prehistory and history have been until now limited; the appearance of this journal will, it is to be hoped, serve the increasing number of scholars turning to this type of material and permit them to elucidate for other historians what is contained therein. This journal is physically attractive, and is well illustrated with both color and black-and-white photos, drawings, and maps. The eight-by-eleven-inch size of the publication makes possible illustrations of a size appropriate to the subject and to clarity. There are a couple of shortcomings in this generally excellent production: Harlan's text, p. 73, cites Munson, 1976, but no such reference is given in the bibliography. The absent reference is probably Munson's contribution to a volume edited by Harlan (!), but the lacuna is unfortunate. On page 112, Figs. 1 and 2 are mentioned in the text, but the photos on page 111 are not numbered. The maps on pages 62 and 63 have the captions that should go with the tables on pages 64 and 65, and even when properly placed are not as informative as they might be. Van Neer's map on page 63 indicates the sites discussed by numbers, but other cartograhic information has to be deduced; presumably one type of hatching indicates higher elevations and another type depressions, or basins, and the unnumbered dots are other known sites of fish remains not discussed here.</page><page sequence="4">540 BOOK REVIEWS The editor, or his assistants, could extract more adequate captions from contributors when necessary and be careful that labels are correctly attached. Subscription to this excellent periodical is 20,000 Italian Lira (ca. $15.00) per copy, payable to Pyramids, snc. Secunda Strada 2, San Felice, 20090 Segrate (Milano) Italia. But articles and communications should be sent to the editor, Alfred Muzzolini, 7 rue J. de Resseguier, 31000 Toulouse (France). Articles are accepted in English, French, and Italian and should have the author's summary in his own language and, if possible, in the other two (if not, the editorial staff will provide them). Other contributions need not have either summary or translations. DANIEL F. MCCALL Boston University POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT IN AFRICAN STATES 1960-1985. Edited by Peter Duignan and Robert H. Jackson. Stanford, California: Hoover Institution Press, 1986. Pp. 442. $36.95 cloth, $20.95 paper. In this edited volume, funded by a special grant from the Hoover Institution Research Projects Committee, the contributors were invited to consider the formal structure of government at the time of independence in sub-Saharan Africa and to trace changes that have occurred since then. Specifically, they were asked to deal with state machinery, the civil service, parastatals, defense and police forces, party structure and political opposition, and trade unions. The volume does not deal in depth with economics, but refers to economic questions as they affect politics and government. Peter Duignan and Robert H. Jackson have brought together an authoritative array of scholars. Crawford Young writes on Zaire and the Cameroon, Victor Levine on the states of former French West Africa, Christopher Clapham on the Horn of Africa, and Thomas H. Henriksen on Lusophone Africa. Even though there is a wealth of data and some good insights, this is a difficult book to review. The individual chapters are worthwhile, but the book is flawed by the ideological underpinnings in the Introduction written by Peter Duignan and by some of the ideas in the chapter on South Africa by Duignan and L.H. Gann. For example, writing on the failings of African leadership, Duignan sweepingly dismisses real achievements in the post-independence period. Since independence African peoples-both rulers and ruled- have widely been inclined to disregard both public morality and democratic rights. Many of Africa's leaders and their parties or clients have proved to be ineffectual, overly ethnic in orientation, and corrupt. The military rulers have seldom been an improvement. All too often, African rulers have behaved as if public goods were private property. Friends, relatives, and clients have received appointments, favors, and high salaries to the detriment of the common good (p. 25).</page></plain_text>
