<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bernini and Ovid: Expanding the Concept of Metamorphosis ANN THOMAS WILKINS Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598-1680) was influenced by a number of contemporary and an- cient sources--including Ovid's Metamorphoses-and inspired by the very concept of chang- ing forms. Two examples of the sculptor's early mythological works considered are the Apollo and Daphne, the most comprehensive demonstration of Ovid's influence in theme and concept, and the Neptune and Triton, in which we can observe perhaps the most subtle metamorphosis created by Bernini. From the front view the fleeting suggestion of an entire dolphin can be seen, with Neptune's foot forming the tail and the swirling end of his cloak suggesting the head. The spontaneous and unexpected appearance of this dol- phin is Ovidian in concept, and the defiance of logic witnessed when a leg and a flying cloth suddenly form a leaping dolphin is likened thematically to the Metamorphoses, which recounts example after example of improbable happenings and appearances. Even the gods must be baffled By richness of change and becoming, By the anguish of answered prayer ... George Garrett, "Virtuosity"--contemplating Bernini's Apollo and Daphne or centuries Ovid's Metamorphoses, the most complete and enchanting surviving guide to ancient myth, has offered challenging themes to patrons, painters, and sculptors. It has long been recognized that the Italian Baroque sculptor Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598-1680) was among the artists most profoundly inspired by the Augustan poet. The issue of literary and artistic sources for Bernini's works is enormously com- In its original form, this paper was presented at the Fourth Meeting of the International Society for the Classical Tradition (ISCT) in Tiibingen, Germany, July 29--August 2, 1998. I initially explored the topic in a paper titled "Ovid Metamorphosed: The Challenge of the Metamorphoses for Italian Artists of the Fifteenth to Seventeenth Centuries." This paper was given at the Western Pennsylvania Symposium on World Literatures (dedicated to Ovid) at Duquesne University on April 8, 1997 in collaboration with David G. Wilkins, Professor of the History of Art and Architecture at the University of Pittsburgh. I am grateful for his continued support and suggestions.

Bernini was surrounded by admired examples of ancient art in Rome and by a literary circle exceptionally well-read in both Augustan and contemporary literature. The intellectual climate of seventeenth-century Rome seems to have fostered scholarly and creative interpretations of ancient literature and art within the context of contem- porary philosophical, political, theological, and artistic terms. Furthermore, the con- cept of the paragone must have encouraged creativity and technical skill at the same time that it encouraged both the union and the rivalry between literature and art. Interest in Ovidian poetry was hardly a new phenomenon in the seventeenth century; moralizing interpretations of the Augustan poet had been common beginning in the twelfth century, and interest in the poet continued into the Renaissance and well beyond.1 Frequent utilization of Ovidian themes in the visual arts and literature has Schmidt (Tiibingen) for their helpful comments following my presentation at the ISCT conference. I also thank Wolfgang Haase, Gunther Heilbrunn, Stephen Newmyer, Katherine Wilkins, and Rebecca Wilkins for their support and comments, Daniel Nolting for his help with the computer-enhanced illustration, Jerry Clack and Larry Gaichas for their support, and Michael Skor for his assistance.--For the above motto from Garrett's "Virtuosity" see his For a Bitter Season: New and Selected Poems (Columbia, MO, 1967), 11. 1. Nigel Llewellyn ("Illustrating Ovid," in Ovid Renewed: Ovidian Influences on Literature and Art from the Middle Ages to the Twentieth Century, ed. C. Martindale [Cambridge, 1988], 151- 66) refers to the use of Ovidian mythological subject matter from the Roman period onward (156) and states that the Metamorphoses was, until the last part of the eighteenth century, a major source, along with the Bible, Homer, and Vergil, for the visual arts (151 ff.). The familiarity of many of the tales appealed to patrons, and Ovidian themes were instructive as well as decorative. On the role of the Metamorphoses and the Fasti in the Renaissance, see Paul Barolsky ("As in Ovid, So in Renaissance Art," Renaissance Quarterly 51 [1998], 451-74), who maintains that "Ovid pervades the visual culture of the Renaissance" (451). See Willem F. Lash ("Ovid," The Dictionary of Art 23 [New York, 1996], 679-81) for a general discussion of the Ovide moralist (an anonymous poem composed c. 1316-28), Christian interpretations of Ovid, the significance of illustrated editions of Ovid, the use of Ovidian subjects as villa and palace decoration, and Ovidian subjects for such painters as Giulio Romano, Titian, Giorgione, and Poussin. For further study of the reception of Ovid in the visual arts and literature from the Middle Ages well into the Modem period, see the following publications of collected articles of the Mannheim- and Jena-based research project of the "Ikonographische Repertorien zur Rezeption des antiken Mythos in Europa": Die Rezeption der Metamorphosen des Ovid in der Neuzeit: Der antike Mythos in Text und Bild, ed.

Hans-Jiirgen Horn and Hermann Walter, Wolfenbiitteler Forschungen 75 (Wiesbaden, 1997). Specific articles in the above works, while not directly relevant to Ovid's influence on Bernini, are indicative of the far-reaching effects of Ovid's Metamor- phoses upon the visual arts. See, for instance, Francesca Cappelletti ("L'utilizzazione allegorica dei miti tratti dalle Metamorfosi di Ovidio nella pittura e nell'emblematica fra '500 e '600," in Die Allegorese des antiken Mythos, 229-252) and Carmen Ravanelli Guidotti ("Le Metamor- fosi 'Vulgari' d'Ovidio sulla Maolica Italiana," in Die Rezeption der Metamorphosen des Ovid in der Neuzeit, 85-97).

In creating the sculp- ture which represents Aeneas's flight from Troy, for example, was Bernini influenced first by Ovid's tale, by Ugo di Carpi's 1518 woodcut depicting the same myth, or by yet other literary or visual sources?2 And which source had the greatest influence? When Bernini was inspired by a Graeco-Roman sculpture, was a particular aspect of the form or technique more important to him than the representation of the theme? When he incorporated ancient art or literature into his own work, was he depicting an ancient subject for its own sake or was he using it for a more sophisticated intellectual end? Given the richness of his intellectual environment,3 the goal of reducing Bernini's influences to a direct one-to-one formula is surely too simplistic. At their best, Bemini's works brilliantly fuse elements from various literary and artistic sources. It is my intent to re-examine observations previously made pertaining to classical influence upon Bernini's early narrative works and to suggest a more comprehensive understanding of ancient, and particularly Ovidian, influence upon the sculptor. I will argue that Bernini was influenced by a number of ancient and contemporary literary and visual sources, not the least of which, of course, are the tales in Ovid's Metamor- phoses, and that he was inspired by the very concept of metamorphosis that provides a common thread in Ovid's epic. Ovid's poem is a unique work in which he drew upon Greek and Roman sources and wove together wondrous tales of transformation, love, gods, heroes, and mortals. The poet begins his work with a statement of purpose: In nova fert animus mutatas dicereformas corpora: di, coeptis (nam vos mutastis et illas) aspirate meis, primaque ab origine mundi ad mea perpetuum deducite tempora carmen! My mind is set to tell of forms changed into new bodies. Gods, for you have made these changes, inspire my undertakings and lead my continuous song from the world's very beginning into the present time.4 His plan, then, was to write (in continuous verse) about metamorphosis, old forms changed into new. Each change is essentially a separate story; thus the epic's unity is in the theme of change, not in the events narrated.5 Furthermore, there is continuity 2. Charles Avery (Bernini, Genius of the Baroque [Boston, 1997]) notes Ugo's print as a possible visual source (460). 3. One assumes, for instance, that Bernini and his contemporaries were well versed in many literary works and in their influences upon each other. See, for example, James Mirollo, The Poet of the Marvelous, Giambattista Marino (New York, 1963), especially his discussion of Marino's imitation of the works of Petrarch (181-5). See also Jan L. de Jong ("Ovidian Fantasies. Pictorial Variations on the Story of Mars, Venus and Vulcan," in Die Rezeption der Metamorphosen des Ovid in der Neuzeit, 11-172), who notes that many artists knew the Meta- morphoses not from the Ovidian Latin, but from Italian versions that had been adapted or translated from the original (161 f.) 4. Adapted from the Loeb Classical Library translation by Frank Justus Miller (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1946), 3. 5. G. Karl Galinsky (Ovid's Metamorphoses, An Introduction to the Basic Aspects [Berkeley, 1975]) discusses various aspects of the poet's theme of metamorphosis (including its frequent</page><page sequence="4">386 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Winter 2000 between the states of the individual who is changed--in other words, before and after metamorphosis.6 Daphne, for instance, does not disappear as an entity; she has be- come the laurel tree, and as such her beauty remains.7 Story follows upon story; myths of change familiar to us and to their seventeenth-century audience flow to- gether in Ovid's continuous song of transformation. Representations of mythical themes found in Ovid's epic abounded in Bernini's Rome; visual, poetic, and even musical versions of the Apollo and Daphne, Pluto and Persephone, and other myths were produced with frequency. Painters and sculptors before Bernini, of course, had already addressed the problem of rendering successful visual representations of myth-representations intended to rival and even surpass the tales expressed in words, not merely to illustrate them. Titian, Cellini, and Giambologna are among the Italian artists who sought to interpret and incorporate rather than simply represent ancient myths.8 In the tradition of visual artists involved in the self-conscious struggle with the Ovidian texts, Bernini developed his own ap- proach to the problem of representing transformation in stone, producing works that themselves are examples of what could be called multiple metamorphoses.9 The suggestion that a sculptor could be inspired not only by myths of transforma- tion but also by the concept of change has recently been applied to Michelangelo.1o Paul Barolsky argues that although Michelangelo shows little interest in Ovid's themes from the Metamorphoses,11 he incorporates in his sculptures Ovid's concept of change. In Barolsky's discussion of Michelangelo's non finiti (sculptures that for reasons still uncertain were left unfinished), he cites Ovid's Deucalion and Pyrrha tale, in which stones are transformed into humans: "a certain likeness to the human form, indeed, could be seen, still not very clear, but such as statues just begun out of marble have, subordination to the theme of love) in the context of Augustan Rome. Leonard Barkan (The Gods made Flesh, Metamorphosis and the Pursuit of Paganism [New Haven, 19861, especially pp. 19-93) refers to what he understands as the paradox of the poem: "it proves the natural world magical and the magical world natural" (19). 6. See Joseph Solodow, The World of Ovid's Metamorphoses (Chapel Hill, 1988), 175. See also Brooks Otis, Ovid as an Epic Poet (Cambridge, 1966), 45 ff. and Harold Skulsky, Metamorpho- sis, The Mind in Exile (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1981), especially Chapter 2 ("Ovid's Epic Metamorphosis as Metaphysical Doubt," 24-61). 7. Galinsky maintains that although the physical aspects of individuals may change, "their quintessential substance lives on" (45). 8. See the following for evidence of intensive interest in mythological subjects in the sixteenth century: Erwin Panofsky, Problems in Titian Mostly Iconographic (London, 1969); John Pope- Hennessy, Cellini (New York, 1985); and Charles Avery, Giambologna: The Complete Sculpture (Oxford, 1987). Panofsky, in his chapter on Titian and Ovid, speaks of Titian's "inner affin- ity" with Ovid, which allowed him to "interpret Ovid's texts... with minute attention to detail and in a spirit of uninhibited inventiveness" (140). 9. I used the term "multiple metamorphoses" in my 1997 presentation at Duquesne University (see introductory note). Barolsky's use of this term (with reference to a poem by Lorenzo, "As in Ovid, So in Renaissance Art," 457) is independent from mine. For the idea see also Elizabeth Vinestock, "Ovid metamorphosed: Ovidian techniques transposed in Baif's L'Hippocrkne," Renaissance Studies 13 (1999), 63-72. 10. See Paul Barolsky, "Florentine Metamorphoses of Ovid," Arion 6.1 (1998), 9-31. 11. Barolsky ("Florentine Metamorphoses") maintains that Michelangelo's poetry "is scarcely Ovidian and in his sculpture and painting Ovid is never to be found" (14).</page><page sequence="5">Wilkins 387 not sharply defined, and very like roughly blocked-out images."12 In relating the Ovidian passage to Michelangelo's relief of The Battle of the Lapiths and the Centaurs, Barolsky argues that the work has not been left unfinished as generally thought but is, rather, an example of Ovidian transformation-in this case of stone in the process of being changed into the likeness of humans.13 The process of transformation is re- vealed in the portions of stone left rough and formless. Bernini, however, unlike his Florentine predecessor, was captivated by Ovidian themes. His Apollo and Daphne (figure 1), as the most comprehensive demonstration of Ovid's influence in both theme and concept, is an appropriate starting point for this discussion.14 Mimicking the Ovidian narrative in stone and exemplifying the concept of change by both direct and subtle means, it offered a seventeenth-century observer metamorphoses on several different levels. Ovid's text suggests that by the time Apollo reaches Daphne, her river-god father has answered her plea for help and is beginning to transform her into a laurel tree. In Berini's sculpture, this metamorphosis is shown in process: Apollo's hand touches the bark which has begun to encompass her, and with some confusion he gazes stupe- fied as Daphne's hands and hair sprout branches and leaves. Bernini's sculpture also explores and expresses the emotional transformation of the two participants. Daphne's fear is expressed in her open-mouthed scream as she is transformed from human form into a mute and rooted tree.15 Apollo, on the other hand, wavers between ardor and realization, in transition from joy to confusion. Ovid's tale gradually unfolds to ob- servers walking by the sculpture: as fingers become branches, hair turns into leaves, 12. Barolsky, ibid., 12 f. 13. Barolsky, ibid., 13. See his discussion of other sculptures by Michelangelo as well (15 ff.). Scholarly debate has long addressed the issue of the non finiti. Teddy Brunius ("Michelangelo's non finito," in Per Bjurstrom et al., Contributions to the History and Theory of Art, Figura NS. 6 [Uppsala, 1967], 29-67) discusses varying opinions regarding the sculptor's intentions, citing works such as Das Unvollendete als kiinstlerische Form.

See Brunius 31 and 59 ff. for further bibliography and 34 regarding Michelangelo's biographers, Giorgio Vasari and Ascanio Condivi. According to Barolsky, Condivi (whose veracity is questioned) main- tained that Michelangelo intentionally left areas of roughly worked stone in order to indi- cate the difficulties involved in the transition from rock to fully delineated figure. For discussion of sixteenth-century art theory, see David Summers, Michelangelo and the Lan- guage of Art (Princeton, NJ, 1981). 14. For the most recent detailed discussion and extensive bibliography regarding this and other Bernini sculptures considered here, see the important papers in Anna Coliva and Sebastian Schuitze (curators), Bernini Scultore: La Nascith del Barocco in Casa Borghese (Rome, 1998). For basic studies on the Apollo and Daphne, see also Peter Anselm Riedl, Gian Lorenzo Bernini: Apoll und Daphne (Stuttgart, 1960), and Apollo e Dafne del Bernini nella Galleria Borghese, ed. Kristina Herrmann Fiore (Milan, 1997). 15. The narrative progresses from the chase to Daphne's fear (indicated by her scream, which observers are able to see briefly before her eyes come into view), and finally to Apollo's confusion as he grasps and sees bark, leaves, and branches. There is a point at which the heads are no longer visible; foliage disguises god and nymph, and the transformation is understood as complete. This view, however, can only be seen if the sculpture is not placed against a wall.

Furthermore, Bemrnini's portrayal of the pursued and the pursuer suggests the natural context the myth demands. Much of the environment is created, as it were, by the narrative as formulated by Bernini's figures: the leafy laurel tree, in the process of its formation, establishes the wooded scene of the chase, and rocks at Apollo's feet further define the setting while at the same time negating the geometric or molded base typical of many Renaissance sculptures.16 The representation is, in fact, unquestionably similar to the text of the myth found in Ovid's Metamorphoses: ... nudabant corpora venti, obviaque adversas vibrabantflamina vestes, et levis inpulsos retro dabat aura capillos,.... vix precefinita torpor gravis occupat artus, mollia cinguntur tenui praecordia libro, in frondem crines, in ramos bracchia crescunt, pes modo tam velox pigris radicibus haeret, ora cacumen habet: remanet nitor unus in illa. (527-9; 548-52. The full reference is Book I, 452-567) The wind exposed her body, the opposing breezes made her clothes move, and a light breeze made her hair fly behind her.... When her prayer was barely finished, a down-dragging numbness seized her limbs, and her soft sides were surrounded with thin bark. Her hair was changed to leaves, her arms to branches. Her feet, recently so swift, grew fast in sluggish roots, and her head was now a tree's top. Her gleaming beauty alone remained.7 The close relationships between poem and sculpture, often noted,'8 strongly suggest that this specific ancient Roman text served as a challenge for the seventeenth-century sculptor. I suggest further that the impact of Ovid's Metamorphoses on this and other sculptures was more extensive and not always so direct. Another poem--itself dependent upon Ovid--has been cited as a literary source for Bernini's Apollo and Daphne: "Dafne," from the Egloghe Boscherecce by Giovanni Battista Marino, was published in 1620, just two years before Bernini began his work on this theme.19 More than half of the poem (lines 17-113) is dedicated to Apollo's 16. In his discussion of Bernini's "un bel composto" conception of the visual arts, Irving Lavin (Bernini and the Unity of the Visual Arts [New York, 1980]) states that "Bernini's works virtually from the outset create a startling sense of environment. We can almost see the sylvan glade where Apollo captures Daphne...." (19). In similar fashion, environments can be seen in other mythological groups as well: the addition of Cerberus in the Pluto and Persephone sites the action as taking place in the Underworld, and the shell on which the god stands in the Neptune and Triton helps create the aquatic context. 17.

This poem was not the only</page><page sequence="8">390 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Winter 2000 frustration at Daphne's flight, her rejection of him, and her ultimate form as a laurel tree--aspects of the tale that Bernini emphasizes as well. This source, contemporary with the sculptor, reveals the complexity of studying artistic precedents: ancient myth as represented by Ovid influenced a seventeenth-century Italian poet, and both an- cient and contemporary versions seem to have played a role in the genesis of Bernini's sculpture. Visual sources have also been noted for the Apollo and Daphne.20 Perhaps the best- known ancient representation of the god in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was the Apollo Belvedere. In the Vatican collections since 1503, this work is now identi- fied as a second-century CE marble copy of a fourth-century BCE Greek bronze origi- nal.21 Bernini's Apollo brings his predecessor to life: the head, the outstretched arms with the left raised higher than the right, and the position of the legs, with the right foot planted on the ground and the left leg stretching behind, are clearly reminiscent of and inspired by the antique work. Another kind of metamorphosis is thus sug- gested, one in which a famous ancient sculpture has been revivified and is placed within a narrative context.22 The ancient standing Apollo becomes Bernini's Apollo, who runs in pursuit of Daphne. Bernini has restored physical and emotional life to an ancient representation of the god; 23 the Belvedere statue is incorporated into the narra- tive described by Ovid and Marino. Sixteenth- and earlier seventeenth-century sculp- ture and painting as well may also be reflected in Bernini's work; the rear view of Apollo, for instance, has been noted as being close to the pose of Acis in Annibale Carracci's Polyphemus and Acis.24 Marino work that pertains to Apollo and Daphne; among other pieces he composed a sonnet ("Trasformazione di Dafne in Lauro," 1614).

See Avery 56 ff. for discussion of Bernini's visual sources, ancient and contemporary. 21. For discussion of the Apollo Belvedere and its appearance as Berini would have viewed it, which is different from today's condition, see Phyllis Pray Bober and Ruth Rubinstein, Renaissance Artists and Antique Sculpture (New York, 1986), 71 f., and Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, Taste and the Antique (New Haven, 1981), 148 ff. 22. The Apollo Belvedere now is lacking portions of both arms. As documented by Bober, after the sculpture was installed in the Cortile del Belvedere, the right arm was replaced by Montorsoli in 1532-2 and both hands restored (28). Montorsoli's additions were removed by Guido Galli in 1924-5 (see Georg Daltrop, "The Apollo Belvedere," in The Vatican Collec- tions. The Papacy and Art [exhibition catalogue; New York, 1982], 63). Thus Bernini's Apollo resembles Montorsoli's restoration more closely than that of Galli. 23. Vasari understood the Apollo Belvedere as "providing the lessons of ease and grace in rendering the human figure" to such artists as Leonardo and Michelangelo (Preface to part I of the Lives as referred to by Bober [71]; see Giorgio Vasari, Le vite de' piu eccellenti pittori ed architettori, ed. Gaetano Milanesi, vol. IV [Firenze, 1906; repr. ib. 1998], 10). 24. Kenseth 195.

Yet the sculpture's observers could not have grasped this unfolding narrative at first sight; they needed to walk by the group in order to comprehend it.25 Observation from one point would not have allowed viewers to see in Bernini's sculp- ture the unfolding story of change as narrated by Ovid and Marino. The experience of a seventeenth-century visitor viewing the sculpture was differ- ent from our own. Now situated inappropriately in the middle of a room in the Villa Borghese, the Apollo and Daphne was originally placed against the room's west wall next to an entrance.26 This placement meant that a visitor would first have seen Apollo from behind;2 Daphne would have been virtually invisible and the narrative tantaliz- ing but still ambiguous. As the visitor walked gradually around the sculpture, the nymph would have begun to appear and the development of the narrative would have been slowly perceived.28 Indeed, it can be argued that the sculptor was choreo- graphing the observer's perception and realization of the story. This experience of the sequential development of the narrative would have related the sculpture even more intimately to Ovid's and Marino's texts, since narrative, whether heard or read, is always experienced over time; the parallelism between the two would have been more evident and Bernini's inventive genius even more apparent.29 The further idea that Bernini's sculpture represents the metamorphosis of poetic texts into marble is important; solid, unyielding stone has taken on the quality of fluid narrative. In creating this work, it seems likely that Bernini was participating in one of the great intellectual debates of the period, the paragone.3a The term itself is under- Meth del Cinquecento. II Caso della Farnesina," in Die Rezeption der Metamorphosen des Ovid in der Neuzeit, 115-128. 25. Wittkower maintains that even though Bernini did not accept the multiple views apparent in Mannerist sculpture, he "did not return to the Renaissance limitations dictated by the block-form..." (15). 26. None of the three statues executed for Scipione Borghese's villa--the Apollo and Daphne, the David, and the Pluto and Persephone-was intended to be freestanding. For a detailed discus- sion of the placement of the sculptures, see Kenseth 193 ff. Kenseth disagrees with Hibbard, who places the Apollo and Daphne against the east wall (53 f.). According to Kenseth, early guidebooks to the Villa Borghese by Jacomo Manilli (1650) and Domenico Montelatici (1700) clarify the placements of the sculptures. For these texts, see Kenseth 202 ff. See A. Gonzilez- Palacios, "La stanza di Apollo e Dafne in the Villa Borghese," The Burlington Magazine 137 (1995), 529-49. 27. Kenseth points out that Cardinal Borghese, Bernini's patron, collected sculpture and paint- ings which represented sensual subjects. The ancient sculpture of a Hermaphrodite, for instance, also has "a most provocative rear view" (195). Thus, the initial rear view of Apollo was not unique. 28. Kenseth 195. See Avery 63 regarding the configuration of the sculpture in its room: Apollo and Daphne would have appeared to be running toward the window, which was the strongest light source. 29. In addition to poetic and visual versions of the Apollo and Daphne myth, a dramatic cantata contemporary with Bernini was composed by Claudio Monteverdi. The Lamento di Apollo, c. 1620, reinforces the prevalence of and familiarity with mythological themes in Rome, at least among intellectuals.

See also Rudolf Preimesberger, "Themes from Art Theory in the Early Works of</page><page sequence="10">392 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Winter 2000 stood as "comparison," but in the Renaissance it had come to encompass the rivalry between poetry and the visual arts over which was superior, as well as the contest between painting and sculpture over which was the more subtle or "poetic" art. In the latter, sculpture generally lost to painting. I suggest that in the Apollo and Daphne (and in some of his other early works as well) Bernini set out to demonstrate that sculpture is as good, if not better, than painting at expressing the poetic. Admittedly difficult to render in sculpture, the por- trayal of Daphne's metamorphosis had been the subject of earlier engravings and paintings such as that of Antonio Pollaiuolo (London, National Gallery).31 An impor- tant difference between poetry and the visual arts is that while the poet can develop a story over a period of time, the painter or sculptor is usually restricted to depicting a single moment.32 We might argue, however, that Bernini's sculpture rivals poetry in the manner in which it represents the sequential development of the story and--in a sense-that it surpasses poetry in that the sculptural medium can more successfully represent the illusion of bark and leaves.M3 In part Bernini rivals poetry by comman- deering what was considered to be one of its great virtues-the ability to develop a narrative over time. In the Apollo and Daphne I would suggest that the intimate connec- tion between text and sculpture evolved at least in part because Bernini set out to rival Ovid at his own game. As is the case with many works from the Renaissance, Baroque, and other peri- ods, the finished product has to be understood as the result of a collaboration between artist and patron. The Apollo and Daphne was commissioned by Cardinal Scipione Borghese in 1622 and installed in his villa.- Scipione was a major figure in Roman intellectual circles, and the Villa Borghese, with its large park and extensive collection of antiquities and contemporary works, was an important site for artistic and intellec- tual activity.3 Whether it was he who proposed the challenging theme of Apollo and Daphne or the sculptor who suggested it is unknown.

These works were to be admired for</page><page sequence="11">Wilkins 393 The religious vocation of Bernini's patron suggests yet another level of metamor- phosis for this sculpture (as well as for some of the other mythological works): the transformation of Graeco-Roman themes to express Christian morality. Barberini wrote a Latin distich, inscribed on the base of the Apollo and Daphne, which connects the Ovidian theme with contemporary morality: quisquis amans sequitur fugitivae gaudiaformae fronde manus implet baccas seu carpit amaras the lover who would fleeting beauty clasp plucks bitter fruit; dry leaves are all he'll grasp.6 Baldinucci, Bernini's seventeenth-century biographer,37 suggests that this distich would have rendered Daphne "less offensive to the eyes of a chaste spectator."38 The well- known myth, then, becomes a warning, a statement of Chastity's victory over Passion that offers a distinctly Christian message. Bernini's early training and the possible influences that directed him to Augustan sources and to the Ovidian concept of change must be considered. Bernini may well have encountered Ovidian and other texts when still a youth.39 Born in Naples in 1598, Gianlorenzo Bernini was approximately eleven years old when his father, the sculptor Pietro Bemini, brought him to Rome and presented him as a prodigy to Pope Paul V Borghese. Baldinucci tells us that the pope was impressed with the boy's potential and asked Cardinal Maffeo Barberini-who in addition to his other activities was a poet writing in Latin-to care for him. After 1623, when Barberini was elected Pope Urban VIII, he became one of Bernini's most important patrons.40 It was most likely from Maffeo Barberini or the members of his circle that Bernini gained an under- standing of the literary works that would inspire a number of his sculptures. Indeed, their technical mastery (138). See A. Gonzilez-Palacios, 529-49 and the articles pertaining to the "Stanza di Apollo e Dafne" in Apollo e Dafne del Bernini nella Galleria Borghese).

David Wilkins has suggested to me that, since the Apollo and Daphne narration appears early in Ovid's text, Bernini may have come upon it while a youth practicing his Latin and that the challenge of representing such a complex and compelling theme may have perco- lated in the artist's imagination over a number of years. 40.

Also important for Bernini's development were the collections of antiquities in the Vatican and the Borghese; the latter included both the Apollo Belvedere and the ancient marble Gladiator said to have inspired Bernini's David.42 Domenico Bernini, the sculptor's son, states in his account of his father's education that the young Bernini gave attention to the study of ancient sculptures as well as to the Vatican frescoes by Raphael, Michelangelo, and Giulio Romano.43 Furthermore, Bernini is known to have been a "restorer" of antiquities, repairing and disguising the damage suffered by the Barberini Faun (now in the Glyptothek, Munich), the Ares Ludovisi (Museo delle Terme, Rome), and the Borghese Hermaphrodite (Paris, Louvre)." Before the science of archaeology was established, collectors pre- ferred their antiques complete and not "broken"; the resulting "restorations" satisfied them and provided sculptors with a source of additional income. In contrast to current views of this kind of restoration, the practice was well accepted in the seventeenth century. The process of restoration, however, was more intellectual than merely piec- ing together the ancient and the modem; the challenge was not so much to create, but to attempt to recreate what had been lost.45 The work now widely accepted as Bernini's earliest surviving sculpture, The Goat Amalthea Nursing the Infant Zeus with a Faun, reflects ancient (Hellenistic) sculpture in the treatment of marble.46 It is possible that with this piece the boy Bernini set out to demonstrate his ability to rival (or better) antiquity by producing a work that could pass as an antique.4 Although of uncertain date, The Goat Amalthea was possibly 41. Rudolf Preimesberger discusses the sculptor's intellectual milieu (2 ff.). He identifies Barberini as the young sculptor's "intellectual mentor" who saw that Bernini was educated in art theory through debates, exchanges of letters, and workshop experience which taught him rules of proportions and other matters. 42. The Gladiator had been discovered in 1611 and was in the collection at least by 1613 (Haskell and Penny 211). Also included in the Borghese collections were the Borghese Hermaphrodite, the Centaur with Cupid, Silenus with Infant Bacchus, and the Dying Seneca, all of which are currently in the Louvre. (As noted by Haskell and Penny, most of the Borghese antiquities were purchased by Napoleon Bonaparte, Prince Camillo Borghese's brother-in-law [179]). The Marcus Curtius Flinging Himself into the Gulf, a fragment that is thought to have been greatly restored by Pietro Berini in 1617, was also in the collection (Haskell and Penny 192). See C. Gasparri, "Bernini e l'antico.

For instance, Bernini added a mattress to the Hermaphrodite in approximately 1620, thus providing a naturalistic base for the reclining figure. 46. Avery discusses Bernini's treatment of the goat's coat and the blank eyes as being deliber- ately reminiscent of Hellenistic sculpture (20). 47. Already he may have been testing himself using the benchmark established earlier by Vasari, who in his Lives of the Artists compared Michelangelo to ancient artists: "If it were</page><page sequence="13">Wilkins 395 Fig. 2: Bernini, Pluto and Persephone.

[Michelangelo's paintings] beside the most famous Greek or Roman paintings, they would be held in even greater esteem and more highly honoured than his sculptures, which appear superior to all those of the ancients" (Preface to Part Three of Giorgio Vasari, The Lives of the Artists, trans. Julia Conaway Bondanella [Oxford, 1991], 282; Le vite, ed. Milanesi, vol. IV, 13-14). Vasari tells an anecdote meant to demonstrate how Michelangelo rivaled antique sculptors: "... Michelangelo returned to Florence and carved a little figure of Saint John in marble ... and then with another piece of marble he immedi- ately began to carve a life-size figure of a sleeping Cupid. When this was completed, Baldassare del Milanese showed it as a beautiful piece of work to Pierfrancesco, who agreed with Baldassare's judgement and declared to Michaelangelo: 'If you buried it, I am con- vinced it would pass as an ancient work, and if you sent it to Rome treated so that it</page><page sequence="14">396 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Winter 2000 executed when Bernini was eleven years old, at approximately the same time he met Pope Paul V and Maffeo Barberini.u The patron is not known with certainty, but the sculpture is documented in the Villa collection as early as 1629, suggesting ownership, if not patronage, by Scipione Borghese. The literary sources for this unusual subject are not dear. There are several an- cient references to Amalthea in the form of a nymph or a goat nursing the infant Jupiter,49 but the sculpture does not directly correspond to any of them. The fact that this group has also been understood as representing a goat and the infant Bacchus reveals the difficulty of interpreting this subject.50 Bernini's Pluto and Persephone (1621-22; figure 2), a mythological group executed before the Apollo and Daphne (which may have been commissioned to replace it), was commissioned by Scipione Borghese. Originally intended for the Villa Borghese, it was ultimately presented by Scipione to Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi.51 There are two possible Ovidian sources for this sculpture, which represents Demeter's daughter be- ing abducted by the God of the Underworld. In neither case, however, are the corre- spondences between sculpture and text as close as in the Apollo and Daphne. In the Metamorphoses, as in Bernini's sculpture, the god is dearly abducting the terrified young woman, who calls out for help: appeared old, you would earn much more than by selling it here.' It is said that Michelangelo treated it in such a way that it appeared to be ancient, nor is this astonishing, since he had the genius to do this and more" (423 = Le vite, ed. Milanesi, vol. VII, 147 ff.). 48. According to Wittkower, the sculpture was listed as anonymous in Villa Borghese sources "from Manilli (1650) to Nibby (1838)" (231). On Bernini's visual inspiration for this piece, which may have included Hellenistic and Roman sculptures as well as his father's work, see Hibbard 25.

Preimesberger in Bernini Scultore, 38-51, regarding identification and other issues, such as political connotations. Avery notes that the subject of the suckling goat is a varia- tion on the well-known Roman theme of the she-wolf and Romulus and Remus (19), and David Wilkins has suggested to me that Amalthea's own offspring, Pan, may be repre- sented here. As noted in Irene Earls, Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary (New York, 1987), antique representations of Amalthea as a goat include a painting said to be from the Domus Aurea (Rome) in which infants (possibly Zeus and Hera) are carried on her back, and a marble relief in the Capitoline Museum (Rome) from the second century CE in which Amalthea is standing on a rock offering her udder to the infant while a goddess sits at her side (583). 51. The Pluto and Persephone, Apollo and Daphne, and David were all sculpted during the brief papacy of Gregory XV. When the Pluto and Persephone was completed, Borghese did not install it in his villa as intended but instead presented it to the Cardinal, nephew of the recently-elected Pope Gregory XV. See Hibbard 45 ff. and Matthias Winner ("Bernini the Sculptor and the Classical Heritage in his Early Years: Praxiteles', Bernini's, and Lanfranco's Pluto and Proserpina," Roimisches Jahrbuch far Kunstgeschichte 22 [1985], 191-208) regarding confirmation of the presentation to Ludovisi by payment records. The statue remained in the Villa Ludovisi until 1908, when it was purchased by the state and installed in the Galleria Borghese.</page><page sequence="15">Wilkins 397 paene simul visa est dilectaque raptaque Diti: usque adeo est properatus amor. dea territa maesto et matrem et comites, sed matrem saepius, ore clamat, et ut summa vestem laniarat ab ora, collectiflores tunicis cecidere remissis, tantaque simplicitas puerilibus adfuit annis, . . . (V, 395-400) ... almost simultaneously was she seen and loved and carried away by the god: so precipitate was his love. The terrified girl called sadly for her mother and companions, but more often for her mother. And since she had torn her clothing at its upper edge, the flowers which she had gathered fell out of her loosened tunic; so much innocence was in her youthful years.52 The lengthy version in Ovid's Fasti focuses upon Demeter's grief precipitated by her daughter's abduction. Here, as in the Metamorphoses, flowers figure prominently and Persephone's robe is torn.s3 ipsa crocos tenues liliaque alba legit. carpendi studio paulatim longius itur, et dominam casu nulla secuta comes. hanc videt et visam patruus velociter aufert. regnaque caeruleis in sua portat equis. illa quidem clamabat "io, carissima mater, auferor!" ipsa suos abscideratque sinus: panditur interea Diti via, namque diurnum lumen inadsueti vix patiuntur equi. (IV, 442-450) Persephone herself picked dainty crocuses and white lilies. Intent on gath- ering, she, little by little, strayed far away, and by chance none of her companions followed her. Her father's brother saw her, and no sooner did he see her than he swiftly carried her away with his dusky horses into his own realm. She cried out, "Dearest mother, I'm being carried away!" and she tore her robe. Meantime a road is opened up for the god; for his horses are unaccustomed to the daylight.T4 But unlike the Metamorphoses, the Fasti depicts Pluto carrying Persephone with his horses which thunder into the underworld. While Bernini follows his Ovidian sources in portraying the violent abduction and Persephone's fear and screams, Cerberus, who does not appear in Ovid's versions, is a prominent third member of the pictorial composition: siting the event at the threshold of the Underworld, he also performs a supportive function for the marble group. Absent in Bernini's version are the horses and the flowers, which are prominent in the Ovidian narratives as a rationale for 52. Adapted from the Loeb Classical Library translation, 265, 267. 53.

Among them are ancient sar- cophagi which depict the tale, the Punishment of Niobe (Florence, Uffizi; the head seems to have influenced Persephone's face), Giambologna's The Rape of the Sabine Woman (Florence, Loggia dei Lanzi), and other works portraying two struggling figures.' This particular theme of abduction, which seems to have been frequently por- trayed visually, in poetry, and even in music,57 may also have had a topical signifi- cance. The Borghese palace was located in the vicinity of the Tarentum-a shrine which once held an altar to Pluto, Persephone, and her mother. Scipione Borghese evidently took possession of this palace after the sudden death of his uncle, Paul V, in January 1621;s8 perhaps this ancient theme of death and resurrection was intended to establish a deliberate modem parallel between shrine and palace, pagan myth and Christian patron.59 Pluto and Persephone is similar to the Apollo group in Ovidian theme and multiple metamorphoses-among them marble into flesh, hair, and tears.6 Both the myth and 55. The absence of flowers seems at odds with the distich written by Maffeo Barberini for the original base: "quisquis humi pronusflores legis, inspice saevi / me Ditis ad domum rapi" ("you, who leaning near the ground pick flowers, look on me being carried away to the home of savage Dis"). See Pietro da Barga in Bernini Scultore, 184-203, here 190. 56. Avery 48 ff. See Bober and Rubinstein 56 f. regarding the frequent appearance of this theme on Roman sarcophagi and other funerary relief sculptures.

See Winner 197 regarding "the renewing power of the bereft family tree of the Borghese" as seen also in Lanfranco's ceiling fresco, begun in 1624. Note that as is the case with the Apollo and Daphne, this group's current display differs from the one originally intended. Similar to Bernini's representation of the Apollo and Daphne myth, the abduction to the underworld would also have gradually appeared to the viewer. See Avery 48 ff. for discussion of the similarity of the Pluto and Persephone to the Aeneas group in the representation "of a figure supporting another in mid-air." 60.

Once again the chaste maiden tries to escape a passionate lover, this time only to become his bride in the underworld. Persephone represents and symbolizes the passage from the world of the living to that of the dead. Like Apollo and Daphne, the Aeneas, Anchises, and Ascanius (figure 3), the earliest large-scale sculptural group (1618) connected with Gianlorenzo Bemini,61 demonstrates the synthesis of antique and contemporary sources and ideology into a single work. Here the Trojan hero Aeneas, carrying his aged father with his young son at his side, presses onward toward his goal.62 The literary sources believed to have inspired Bernini, including Vergil's Aeneid, Ovid's Metamorphoses, and an historical elegy written by Maffeo Barberini,63 are complex and seem to reflect the influence of Barberini himself. Barberini's elegy may help explain the choice of theme, for he relates Aeneas and the empire he founded to the rule of the Roman Church in the seventeenth century. In addition, we may have here a play on the name of the patron, for "Scipione" can be understood as "a staff to lean on."64 Just as Aeneas himself was the physical support for his father, so might this metaphor refer to the support the youthful Scipione pro- vided for his uncle, Paul V. Already in this early mythological group the principle of multiple metamorphoses is evident: literary texts are combined and rendered in stone, and ancient Roman ideals are revealed to have a Christian message.6s Antique and contemporary visual sources can also be identified for this sculptural group. An ancient Augustan statue of the same subject once in the Forum of Augustus could well have influenced Bernini's work; although the ancient sculpture did not survive, it was known through renderings on ancient coinage and through a mention in Ovid's Fasti.66 In antiquity, the theme of the three generations had been both alle- gorical and narrative: the specific myth of Aeneas departing the devastated city of from the myth of Persephone into that of Pygmalion. Bernini's magical representation of fingers on flesh recalls Ovid's narration of Pygmalion's caressing the body of the statue (Metamorphoses 10. 258). 61. Baldinucci implies that Pietro Bernini was involved in this work, the first commissioned by Cardinal Scipione Borghese. See Avery 43. 62.

Furthermore, a contemporary model for Bernini's Aeneas may have been Michelangelo's figure of the Risen Christ (1518-21, Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome).6, Although the figures of Aeneas and Christ are not exact mirror images, their stances, arm positions, and lowered glances are similar.69 The possibility that Bernini intended to represent an allegorical precedent for the establishment of the Christian church in Rome suggests that his choice of model was not solely aesthetic. Bernini's Neptune and Triton (figure 4) provides further indication of multiple metamorphoses in his early mythological works. The figural group, commissioned in 1620 by Cardinal Alessandro Damascenti-Peretti Montalto, was the focal point for a large fish pond in the garden of the Villa Montalto on the Viminal.70 The tradition of the sculptural fountain had been long established by this time.71 Jacopo della Quercia, Donatello, and Verocchio were among the early Renaissance sculptors who designed bronze and marble figures for fountains, and Mannerist sculp- tors such as Giambologna and Ammanati produced large-scale fountains depicting Neptune, a rather obvious divinity to place in an aquatic context.2 At times humor was incorporated into fountain design, as seen in some works in the Boboli Garden of Florence.73 The large oval pool known as the Peschiera or Peschierone, over which Berini's marble group was placed, had been designed four decades earlier, in 1579-81, by Domenico Fontana.74 The pond with its three cascades had been cut into the side of 67.

The pond and collection of antiques have been dismantled, but fortunately a print reveals its appearance with Bernini's Neptune and Triton in place.75 Bernini's sculpture seems to have been mounted sideways to the pool, showing water spouting from the conch and the god in silhouette-with the dramatic effect of the god's trident seem- ingly in motion, about to strike the earth. The ancient literary sources have usually been identified as passages from Ovid and Vergil that describe specific moments: when Neptune bids Triton to blow on the shell and recall the waves, and when together they free the ships lodged on the rocks.76 Vergil's Neptune speaks in anger before calming the waters: [Neptunus] dehinc talia fatur: .... quos ego-sed motos praestat componerefluctus; post mihi non simili poena commissa luetis. maturate fugam regique haec dicite vestro: non illi imperium pelagi saevumque tridentem, sed mihi sorte datum. tenet ille immania saxa, vestras, Eure, domos; illa se iactet in aula Aeolus et clauso ventorum carcere regnet."

Cymothoe simul et Triton adnixus acuto detrudunt navis scopulo; levat ipse tridenti et vastas aperit syrtis et temperat aequor atque rotis summas levibus perlabitur undas. So Neptune speaks: .... "Whom I-but no, let me first calm the restless waves; you will pay--another time- with different penalties for your crimes. Go away now, and tell your king [Aeolus] these things: that not to him has destiny allotted the dominion of the sea and the fierce trident, but to me. The enormous rocks are his-your home, East Wind. Let Aeolus be lord of all that lies in that hall and rule in that enclosed prison of the winds." 75.

Sir Joshua Reynolds, the painter, purchased it that year and took it with him to England. At his death in 1792, it was sold to Charles Pelham, Lord Yarborough, who kept it in Walpole House, Chelsea. In 1906 it was moved to Brocklesby Park, Lincolnshire, and it is from there the Victoria and Albert Museum acquired the work in 1950 (132).

Together, then, Cymothoe and Triton, thrusting, dislodge the ships from jagged crags. But now the god himself takes up his trident to lift them, and he clears a channel across the vast sandbank. He stills the sea and glides along the waters on light wheels. (Vergil, Aeneid I, 133 ff.)7 Ovid's Neptune calms the seas and calls upon Triton: nec maris ira manet, positoque tricuspide telo mulcet aquas rector pelagi supraque profundum exstantem atque umeros innato murice tectum caeruleum Tritona vocat conchaeque sonanti inspirare iubetfluctusque etflumina signo iam revocare dato. The anger of the sea subsides, when the sea's ruler lays by his three-pronged spear and calms the waves; and calling sea-green Triton, showing above the deep, his shoulders overgrown with shell-fish, he orders him to blow into his loud-resounding conch, and by that signal to recall the floods and streams. (Metamorphoses I, 330-35)78 In the above accounts, Neptune stills the seas and brings calm and order with the help of Triton, who blows his conch in the Ovidian passage. These Augustan passages portray different flood stories, however: Vergil is narrating the storm endured by Aeneas on his voyage from Troy, while Ovid tells of the flood, caused by divine anger at humankind, which Deucalion survives. Furthermore, in the Vergilian passage Tri- ton aids Neptune by dislodging the ships, not by blowing on the conch to recall the waters. Although it does not include reference to Triton, another passage from Ovid's narration of this great deluge seems even more appropriate for a fountain, for it describes how Neptune causes water to pour forth rather than to become calm: Ipse tridente suo terramin percussit, at illa intremuit motuque vias patefecit aquarum. exspatiata ruunt per apertosflumina campos . . . .... silvasque tenent delphines et altis incursant ramis agitataque robora pulsant. (Metamorphoses I, 283-285; 302-303) 77. Adapted from the translation by Allen Mandelbaum (Berkeley, 1971; repr. Toronto and New York, 1981), 6. 78.

The rivers overleaping all bounds flood the open plains.... Dolphins invade the woods, brushing against the high branches, and shake the oak-trees as they knock against them.. ...79 Bernini's group does not correspond completely to any of the three passages; perhaps here the sculptor combined the various Augustan sources, the result being an amalgam intended to capture the god's power rather than the representation of a particular incident. While the god's windswept hair and cloak as well as the determi- nation he displays suggest the storm in the Vergilian passage, the inclusion of Triton recalls the flood's end.8 Furthermore, one can hardly consider Ovid's version of the Deucalion myth without making the parallel with the Old Testament version of a similar theme: divine anger at mankind results in a flood which destroys all but those few chosen to re-populate the earth-Noah and Deucalion. Again we see how Bernini effects a union of pagan myth and Christian message.81 As seems to be consistent with Bernini's practice, here too he probably made use of both visual and literary sources. Sixteenth-century representations of the ancient subject which would have been available to him include Stoldo Lorenzi's bronze Nep- tune in the Boboli Gardens in Florence.82 As we imagine the Neptune and Triton in situ we can observe yet another type of metamorphosis created by Bernini. From most views the god's cloak billows out and is 79. Adapted from the Loeb Classical Library translation, 23. William Collier suggests this pas- sage as a source, maintaining that receding waters "would have been a strange theme for a fountain and pool. Are we to expect them to dry up at any moment?" (439). 80. Sebastian Schtitze in Bernini Scultore, 170-79, suggests that perhaps the composition ex- presses two moments in time, one after the other: while Neptune is seen to call forth the water, already we see Triton signaling the flood's end. He maintains that in a single sculp- tural work we can understand divine anger as well as approaching calm. 81. Schiitze discusses the intentional nature of this allusion to Genesis (175) and the symbolism of the waters both rising and ceasing as the trident is struck and the conch blown (175). Collier discusses contemporary papal issues and possible connections with the Neptune and Triton theme as well as possible interpretations of the Barcaccia fountain (as "Ship of the Church") and the Fountain of the Four Rivers (440). 82. See Avery 180 f. regarding this work, which dates from 1565-8. Although Neptune's stance is similar in both works, a narrative context is more clearly suggested in Bernini's work by facial expression and the addition of Triton. See Wittkower (Bernini) 234 f. regarding the influence of engravings. For general information regarding visual and literary representa- tions of Triton (such as "Triton with Dolphins" by Giambologna cast in 1598), see The Oxford Guide to Classical Mythology in the Arts, 1300-1900's, vol. 2, 1038 ff.: "Triton has little mythology... (He is) commonly depicted blowing on a conch shell and frolicking in the waves...." See Avery 180 f. and Hildegard Utz, "Skulpturen und andere Arbeiten des Battista Lorenzi," Metropolitan Museum Journal 7 [1973], 60-1) regarding a representation of Triton blowing a conch shell produced by Battista Lorenzi early in the 1570's and probably known to Bernini, Sergei Androsov and Nina Kosareva ("Catalogue," in Bernini's Rome, Chicago, 1998, 62 f.) regarding a terracotta study for the Neptune and Triton, and Luba Freedman for a history of how Neptune's appearance evolved in the 16th century ("Cinquecento Mythographic Descriptions of Neptune," International Journal of the Classical Tradition 2 [1995/961, 44-53).</page><page sequence="24">406 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Winter 2000 simply a mass of flowing material, but when seen from a frontal view,8 the swirling end of the cloak takes on the form of the head of a leaping dolphin. A complicated drapery swirl forms the eye, and the upturned end of the material clarifies the end of the snout. Ovid's evocative suggestion that dolphins were "romping in the woods" at the beginning of the deluge may well have been Bernini's inspiration for this inclu- sion.&amp;4 From the front view we can even see a fleeting suggestion of an entire dolphin which appears to be leaping behind the god and Triton. The forms of the interlocking anthropomorphic figures help create the complete animal: Triton's left arm is flung behind, grasping Neptune's left leg, and the god's right leg forms the remainder of the dolphin, his foot assuming the shape of the animal's tail. Thus, from the frontal view we see three figures: windblown Neptune, trident in hand, ready to strike, the conch- blowing Triton between the god's legs, and the image of the dolphin uniting them.85 When seen quickly, this composition, with the two anthropomorphic figures and one animal, combines the various elements-god, trident, Triton, shell, and dolphin-as attributes of the god and/or part of the flood narrative. Again, as we have seen in the Apollo and Daphne, a natural environment is created: the marble figures of the god and Triton, their attributes, the shell on which the god is poised, and the water--both still (in the pond) and moving (from the jets)-unite to form a comprehensive whole. The spontaneous and unexpected appearance of the dolphin is itself Ovidian in concept; the dolphin is integrated with Neptune iconographically and in terms of the narrative, and the defiance of logic witnessed when a human leg and a flying cloth suddenly form a leaping dolphin is likened thematically to the Metamorphoses, which recounts example after example of improbable physical happenings and appearances.86 While the dolphin's head has been previously discussed, the image of the entire animal has not to my knowledge been noted. This complete profile, formed of marble that simultaneously represents both cloth and flesh, signals once again Bernini's abil- ity to metamorphose text into stone. The animal presence is a delightful addition and, perhaps, a reference to Ovid's romping dolphins. In addition, the arched form of the dolphin would have mimicked the jets of water that decorated the original fountain. Charles Avery in his recent comprehensive survey of Bernini called the dolphin head "a visual pun, a scherzo."87 Perhaps Bernini is only "playing" with his viewers and "scherzo" is a proper appellation; here Bernini may be following the lighthearted tradition that can be seen in some of the Boboli fountains alluded to previously. I would argue, however, that the transitory appearance of the dolphin has a more profound implication as yet another example of Bernini's almost magical ability to 83. See Avery 180 for a discussion of the frontal view as "the central nodule at the hinge of the shell." Note that spectators do not see this view until they walk around the pond. 84. Note that in Bernini's later Tritone fountain in Piazza Barberini (1642-43), four dolphins support the shell. And, as noted by Androsov and Kosareva ("Catalogue," in Bernini's Rome, 79 f.), there exists a terracotta model of Tritons holding dolphins, possibly intended for Piazza Navona. For discussion of dolphins as symbolizing "princely benefaction," see Hibbard 112. 85. Certainly, considerations other than narrative or symbolic existed: the marble group needed support, for instance. 86. Skulsky discusses the absurdity seen in "tree-perching dolphins, aquatic tigers" (24). 87. For discussion of the orientation of the sculpture, see Avery 180 ff. An important consider- ation for ready observance of the dolphin is the relative position of sculpture and observer.</page><page sequence="25">Wilkins 407 transform one thing into another: text into sculpture and, at the same time, cloth and flesh into animal. This is metamorphosis on yet another level. The fact that the dolphin is not seen at first--and that it appears only fleetingly88--is another example of Berini's understanding of how both narrative and sculpture must be perceived over time. The presence of the dolphin illustrates the complexity of Bernini's sources and his application of multiple metamorphoses. If we do indeed have an Ovidian narrative represented, the dolphin is both part of it and an important attribute of the god. The transitory appearance of the animal form in hard, unyielding stone ultimately pro- vides the most subtle example of change seen in the catalogue of works presented here. In conclusion, it is clear that we can attribute to Bernini the metamorphosis of Ovid's Metamorphoses and of his other sources. Such transformations can be literary or visual, obvious to the learned observer (who comprehends the connection between the sculpture and the literary version of the myth, as in the relationship of his Apollo and Daphne to Ovid's poetic text), or creative and subtle--transitory even-as in the mo- mentary appearance of Neptune's dolphin. For Bernini, representing the dramatic moment of change became an integral part of his creative process and artistic vocabu- lary; how much of this is due to Ovid cannot be demonstrated, but there is no question that the sculptor's approach is consistent with that of the ancient author. It cannot be determined with certainty why Bernini moved away from Graeco- Roman mythical themes. Perhaps this was simply a matter of commission: after Cardi- nal Maffeo Barberini became Pope Urban VIII in August 1623, Bemini was extensively employed at the Vatican. Even in his later religious works, however, metamorphosis remained crucial to Bernini's expression, and it can be argued that Santa Bibiana (S. Bibiana, Rome, 1624-26) and The Ecstasy of St. Teresa (S. Maria della Vittoria, Rome, 1645-52) have more in common with the Apollo and Daphne than is generally thought. The two saints can also be seen as representative of the metamorphoses between the human and the divine. In Bernini's representation, Santa Bibiana's joyful acceptance of her martyrdom suggests her transition from a physical to a spiritual state,89 and the sculptor's floating image of St. Teresa and the angel places the saint midway between earthly and heavenly existence." Lavin argues that the Cornaro chapel is the culmina- tion of the "fusion of the arts" in creating a decorative and psychological environment, 88. See Barkan, who in his discussion of Ovid's Narcissus tale, states that "Metamorphosis, then, is a force that underlies all the motions in the story, and the overriding motion is the transformation of real substance into empty fleeting images" (51). 89. See Wittkower 56 regarding Bernini's work on St. Peter's and the church of S. Bibiana during the summer of 1624 as well as on the saint's joyful acceptance of martyrdom. 90. For discussion of the St. Teresa sculpture, see Irving Lavin, Bernini and the Unity of the Visual Arts, especially 107-124, in which he discusses the Cornaro chapel's "fusion of the arts" (14). Lavin considers Teresa's transverberation as "the point of contact between earth and heaven, between matter and spirit" (113). "The apparently distinct themes Bernini conflated with the transverberation-Teresa's death, her eucharistic levitation, and her mystical mar- riage-are thus profoundly related. Their union made of the Teresa altarpiece an actual embodiment of the ultimate meaning of the liturgy: love, the greatest of Christian virtues, conjoins the invocation of the saint, the sacrifice at the altar and the promise of salvation."</page><page sequence="26">408 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Winter 2000 a development that can be seen has having its origins early in Bernini's career in such works as the Apollo and Daphne and Neptune and Triton. As we have seen, Bernini's mythological sculptures display multiple metamor- phoses as they narrate well-known mythological tales; they change as they are ob- served. Poetry becomes sculpture, words change into marble, ancient sculptures are called to mind, and Graeco-Roman themes are transformed by Christianity. The expe- rience of transformation, both as represented in a work and on the part of the specta- tor, is crucial to the sculptures of Bernini that we have discussed. By its nature, sculp- ture is three dimensional; Bernini has incorporated the fourth dimension-time--and in that fourth dimension he has captured the spirit of Ovid's epic of change. The complexity of Ovid's narrative is matched and even surpassed by Bernini's works, which fuse representation, narrative, reminiscences of antiquity, recollections of earlier works of art and literature, and the almost magical transformation of stone. The boundaries among human, divine, and animal and between life and death, joy and despair, are fluid and ever-changing. We might venture that it was this con- ception of metamorphosis, rendered in poetry so successfully by Ovid, that laid the basis for the masterpieces of one of the greatest Counter-Reformation Baroque artists.</page></plain_text>
