W. Munro , М.Л., D.Sc., Professor of Zoology and Applied Entomology , Imperial College of Science , ш the Chair the chairman : My duty here to-day is to introduce to you the lecturer for this afternoon, Dr. Gooding. As you will already know, Dr. Gooding is Chairman of the Research Committee of the British Beekeepers' Association. That Association is, as its name implies, an association of professional and of amateur beekeepers; their interests are in bees and in beekeeping, and, as has happened in every other form of craft to-day, the beekeepers have found that they must keep abreast of what is known as scientific research. They are exceedingly fortunate in having their Research Committee, and especially fortunate in having as Chairman of it a man of the standing and ability of Dr. Gooding. Now he would insist, quite rightly, that although his profession is that of a medical man, he is, as far as bees are concerned, an amateur. I think it is one of the glories of apiculture, both scientific and practical, that as important contributions have been made to it by amateurs as by professionals. Dr. Gooding is going to tell you something of recent research on bees, and in particular on their behaviour. One of the things that rather worries me about recent trends in the study of the behaviour of insects, is that those of us who profess a knowledge of zoology, and claim to be zoologists, may before very long have to take second place to the so-called electronic physicists. I do not know how far they will push us into the background ; it will not be for long. But what interests me is that, even among my own students, I find those who can make rings round me where electronics is concerned, and I am always hoping that some day they will strike on a biological problem and have to come back to me feeling more humble than they do at the present. I think you will find that Dr. Gooding will show why it is that this new atomic physics is coming in, and I think you will realize that if we are to get much further in the study of the behaviour of bees we shall have to face up to the fact that vibrations and all these other horrid things that make noises must be a part of our study. The following paper , illustrated by lantern slides , was then read: THEPAPER There are two things that most people know about bees, one is that they produce honey and the other is that they sting. It is unfortunate that another activity of the bees, namely pollination, is not more widely known, for it is because of this that bees are of such value to the community. I want to touch 597</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 2ÇTH JUNE 1 95 1 upon these three activities, more particularly from the point of view of the advances in our knowledge of these matters during the last six years. I say the last six years, because it was in 1945 that the last Royal Society of Arts' lecture was given on the subject of bees, when Dr. C. G. Butler took as his subject "The Behaviour of Bees when Foraging". Since 1945 some very remarkable research has been done in Austria by Karl von Frisch1, in which he has shown that the information communicated by bees within the hive is of a very definite and precise character. Not only does the returning forager-bee communicate to other bees in the hive the direction in which forage is to be found, but also its distance from the hive. The method of communication is by means of dances called by von Frisch the "language of bees". Von Frisch used an observation hive and marked bees, and he observed that when one of his marked bees returned to the hive it danced a dance. It would dance round a few cells to the right and then up the diameter and round a few cells to the left and up the diameter, and as it traversed the diameter it waggled its abdomen from side to side. This process was called by von Frisch the "tail-wagging dance". It seemed to be observed by surrounding bees who followed round and got caught up in the dance. Afterwards these bees would fly out of the hive and go to the source of pollen or nectar from which the dancing bee had come. Certain features of this dance have, during the last few years, been brought to light. One feature is that there is almost a linear relationship between the number of tail- wags of the dancing bee and the distance of the forage from the hive. If the forage is within 100 metres from the hive then the rate of tail- wags is 40 times per minute; if г' miles, which is the limit of the foraging bee's journey, then the rate of tail-wags is 8 times per minute. If the forage is to be found over 2 ' miles away the returning forager does not tail-wag at all, and so no further bees travel a greater distance than this from the hive, in search of pollen or nectar. If the distance of the forage from the hive is less than 100 metres, then the round dance is performed. The round dance is a modification of the tail- wagging dance; there is no indication in it of the distance or direction of the forage from the hive. We see, then, that the distance of the forage from the hive is indicated by the number of tail- wags which the dancing bee performs as it traverses the diameter. But the direction of this diameter and its angle to the vertical are also an important factor in the dancing bee's message to the other bees in the hive. If the diameter is directly vertical, then the forage is in the line of the hive to the sun; if the diameter is at an angle to the vertical, then the forage is to be found at that angle from the line joining the hive and the sun. And so it is that not only the distance but also the direction from the hive is indicated by the returning foraging bee, to the other bees in the hive. It might be asked : How does the bee know which is the direction of the sun on a cloudy day? And the answer to this question is one of the most recent and most wonderful of von Frisch's discoveries. It is true that on a thickly References will be found on page 616. 598</page><page sequence="3">29TH JUNE 1 95 1 RECENT RESEARCH ON BEES AND BEEKEEPING overclouded day the bees will stop dancing altogether, but if there is a piece of blue sky to be seen then the bees dance normally. It is well known that the light reflected from the blue sky is partially polarized, that is to say, the light waves vibrate in one plane only. It is also known that the degree of polarization of the blue sky is proportional to the distance of that piece of blue sky from the sun. The greater the angle between that piece of blue sky and the sun the greater the polarization, the nearer to the sun the less the polarization. And so, if bees were sensitive to the degree and angle of polarization of the light from the blue sky, they would be able to know where the sun actually was, although it might be obscured by cloud. And this is exactly what von Frisch was able to show, namely, that bees were sensitive to the degree and angle of polarized light. Figure i. Showing, di agra nmiatica 1 1 y , the angle through which the dancing bee moves , as the polaroid screen above moves through a corresponding angle When bees dance in the darkness of the hive, the vertical direction is, of course, related to gravity. When the same bees dance in the horizontal plane, as, for instance, when their comb is put face uppermost, on the alighting board, then the vertical becomes the actual direction, pointing directly to the forage, from the hive. If, in fact, a comb is put on the horizontal on an alighting board and the returning bee allowed to dance, then, by shining a strong light on the bee and gradually swinging the light round, one is able to swing round the line of direction of the horizontal dance to the same amount as the light is swung round. The bee is obviously orientating her dance to the direction of the bright light just as though it were the sun. If, in addition, the light reaching the bee is polarized, by placing between the light and the bee a polaroid screen, then by 599</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 29TH JUNI*' 1951 Figure 2. A diagrammatic representation of Waterman's experiment with polarized light and the eye of the King Crab. The galvanometer , attached to a single optic nerve , shows a maximum kick as the angle of polarized light is rotated . The eye of the King Crab is, therefore , sensitive to polarized light gradually turning round the polaroid screen, and so altering the plane of polariza- tion, the tail-wagging run of the bee would turn through a corresponding angle also (Figure 1). It would seem, therefore, that the eye of the bee is able to appreciate both the degree of polarization of light that falls upon it, and also the angle of polarization. Von Frisch has shown2 that the degree of accuracy of the appreciation of this angle of polarization is within 3e ; and as the acuity of vision of the bee's eye is only about Io, this means that this appreciation of the polarization reaches nearly to the limits of accuracy of which the bee's eye is, in any case, capable. Confirmation of this work comes from recent researches by Vowles3 on the sense of direction in ants, and by Waterman4 on the eye of Limulus, the "King Crab". As I am primarily dealing with the behaviour of bees, I need not go into this work in detail: suffice it to say that the eyes of ants, like the eyes of bees, are sensitive to the polarization of light, and it seems very probable that these creatures use their ability in this respect to determine the direction in which they are walking. The work on Limulus, the King Crab, is important because it demonstrates a probable mechanism by which the eyes or ommatidia are able to differentiate alterations of the plane of polarization of incident light (Figure 2). It is important also from the fact that the King Crab is the marine equivalent of the land-living scorpion and, as Waterman says, "its recognizable ancestry extends back beyond the Silurian period, more than 300 million years ago". It seems probable, therefore, that this property of the compound eye is a primitive one, and the insects inherit it from their arthropod ancestors, and they have put it to use to aid them in their sense of direction. Bees, then, have an elaborate system of communication within the hive. 600</page><page sequence="5">29TH JUNE 1 95 1 RECENT RESEARCH ON BEES AND BEEKEEPING It is, very largely, a language of dances, and it would seem most probable that there are even more varieties of dance than have been described so far. But, from what we have learnt up to the present, it seems that bees are able to com- municate to one another the distance and the direction in which pollen or nectar are to be found, together with their perfume and abundance. Passing from the sense of sight of the bee and its appreciation of the degree of polarization of the light, together with a recognition of the plane of polarization, it must be mentioned that recently Grant5 in Australia has produced some evidence that bees may be sensitive to infra-red radiation through their sensory pits. Certain it is that bees possess numerous sense pits. These consist of an air space separated from the outside air by a membrane; and the air within this air space will expand when radiation falls upon this membrane and warms up - the air within. This increased air pressure would be transmitted to sensitive nerve endings in the sense pit. Infra-red radiation was used during the war as a means of night navigation, and it now appears that we should take infra-red radiation into account as a means by which bees find their way about. From a bee's sense of vision, and its appreciation of infra-red radiation by sense pits, let us pass to the question of a bee's sense of hearing. The question whether bees can hear or not is a difficult one to answer. Indeed it sets a problem that interested the great François Huber6 as long ago as 1791, at about the time of the French Revolution. Huber, of course, was blind from an early age, but through his friend and servant Bernens he studied the emergence of virgin queens in observation hives. Among other things he became interested in their piping, and he speculated upon the site of production of the piping in the queen's body, and also the function of the piping in the life of the hive. Huber describes the posture of the queen while piping: The new queen occupied all our attention. When she approached the other royal cells, the bees on guard pulled, bit her and chased her away ; they seemed to be greatly irritated against her, and she enjoyed tranquillity only when at a considerable distance from these cells. This proceeding was frequently repeated through the day. She twice emitted the sound ; in doing so she stood her thorax against a comb, and the wings crossed on her back; they were in motion without being unfolded or further opened. Whatever might be the cause of her assuming this attitude, the bees were affected by it; all hung down their heads, and remained motionless. He recognized, also, that queens in queen cells piped, and that they did so with different notes according to their degree of maturity. He thought that perhaps it was by these different notes that the worker bees recognized which queen was the next to hatch out. He says: I have a thousand times asked myself how the bees could so accurately distinguish the age of the queen cells. Undoubtedly I should do better to answer this question by a simple avowal of my ignorance. At the same time I must be permitted to state a conjecture. You will admit that I have not, as some authors, abused the right of giving myself up to hypothesis; may not the humming or sound emitted by the young queens in their cells be one of the methods employed by nature to instruct the bees in the age of their virgin queens. It is certain that the female whose cell is first sealed, is also the first to emit this sound. That in the next cell emits it sooner than the rest, 601</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 2ÇTH JUNE 1 95 1 and so with those immediately subsequent. I do not deny that as their added captivity may continue six days, it is possible that the bees, in this space of time, may forget which has emitted it first; but it is also possible that the queens diversify the sounds, increasing the pitch as they become older, and that the bees can distinguish these variations. Indeed, we ourselves have been able to discern differences in the sounds .... He also took the view that a queen's piping was a note of warning and that the bevy of worker bee guards, when they were confronted with the piping of the queen, crouched down and were temporarily distracted from their duties as guards, thus making easier the attack of the piping queen upon the underlying queen cells and the rival queen contained therein. These views are very interesting but they are, of course, merely speculations on the part of François Huber. Nevertheless, all these reactions presuppose hearing, or at any rate a sense of vibration, on the part of the bees. A sense of vibration, however, does not necessarily constitute a sense of hearing. An animal may be able to detect vibrations in the solid ground without necessarily detecting sound waves through the air, which constitutes hearing. Indeed, it is well known to all beekeepers that bees are sensitive to vibration; for it is only necessary to tap a hive; or to run a mowing machine over the lawn near a hive, to recognize that the bees have a sense of vibration. A sense of hearing, however, consists of the ability to appreciate vibrations in the air, sound waves, and to differentiate the varying frequencies of these sound waves. To determine whether or not bees can hear, it is necessary to find some reaction in the bees which will indicate to the experimenter that the sound has been heard. This is not very easy. One way would be to establish in the bees a conditioned reflex to sound. This would mean that when the reflex had been established and a particular note sounded the bees behaved in a predetermined way. Although this can easily be done with fish, dogs and so on, it is found that it cannot be achieved in bees. It seems impossible in bees to establish a con- ditioned reflex to sound (Weber 1933). This would suggest that bees are deaf. In fact, if you play a loud musical instrument near a stock of bees they will show no sign of recognition or appreciation of the sound. It may be, of course, that the honey bee is deaf and has no sense of hearing at all, and in this connection it is interesting to look at what evidence we have for a sense of hearing in other insects. Some grasshoppers, for instance, appear to have ears on their legs. The grasshopper, as you know, maintains chirping contests in the fields on sunny midsummer days. One male grasshopper will chirp and his rival will chirp in reply, and a contest between rival males may involve as many as five hundred chirps by the rival grasshoppers. Professor von Regen7, of Vienna, was interested to determine whether, in point of fact, this was a sense of hearing in the grasshoppers, or whether it was a case of vibration through the ground. Accordingly, he arranged that one chirping male grasshopper should be placed on a toy balloon, and the rival male grasshopper should be placed on another toy balloon within hearing of the first, and the balloons floated in the air. If the chirping contest still went on in 602</page><page sequence="7">2ÇTH JUNE 195 1 RECENT RESEARCH ON BEES AND BEEKEEPING spite of the grasshoppers being on the balloons, then this could be noth- ing else than a sense of hearing. Von Regen proved that the chirping did in fact go on, on the . balloons, and furthermore, if the ear drum on the leg of the grasshopper was destroyed, by an electric- ally heated needle, then the chirping of one grass- hopper was not heard by the other. What is very interest- ing about this experiment, as applied to the honey bees, is that underneath the ear drum of the grass- hopper is an organ called the chordotonal organ (Figure 3) and this struc- ture is present also in the bee's legs, although bees have no ear drum. Similar Figure 3. Top : chordotonal organ and nerve in hind leg of honey-bee. Bottom : chordotonal organ suspended in Hood chamber , and attached at both ends to hypodermis. Right : single sensory element of chordotonal organ ( after Mclndoo) experiments were conducted by Von Regen with crickets. The reaction here is that the male cricket chirps and the female cricket hops towards him. Von Regen went to the length of arranging for the male cricket to chirp into the receiving end of a telephone, and it was found that the female cricket hopped towards the other end of the telephone. This proved, of course, once again, that there was a sense of hearing in the cricket. In the summers of 1946 and 1947 I thought it might be worth while to repeat some of Von. Regen' s experiments with the telephone and instead of using crickets I used honey bees. As was known to Huber, when the queen pipes the bees crouch down upon the surfaces of the combs. It is this reaction that I thought I would use to determine whether or not worker bees can hear. The question to be answered was - does the reaction prove a sense of hearing, or merely a sense of vibration through the combs ? The piping of the virgin queen consists of six short shrill notes and this piping is most readily observed in a stock that has recently swarmed. It was possible to get a piping queen to pipe into a microphone and a loudspeaker, with an oscillograph in series, was taken fifty yards away to an isolated comb on which were running about many of the worker bees from the same hive. We were able to show conclusively that the reaction of the bees to the sound of the piping queen 603</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 2QTH TUNE IQÇI Figure 4. A foraging bee visiting white clover for nectar , and occasionally visiting the near-by Lady Slipper flowers , sampling the nectar through the microphone and loudspeaker, was exactly similar to the reaction as seen by many beekeepers when they hold a comb in their hands on which the piping queen is to be heard. The oscillograph showed that the frequency of the note emitted by the piping queen varied and the six notes that are produced are each a little lower in frequency than the preceding one. It has never been ascertained exactly how the queen produces this sound. It was considered by Weber (1933) that the sound was produced in the spiracles by a vibration of the valve flaps; on the other hand, Imms (1935) considered that it was a stridulation produced at the sclerites of the wing bases. It will, however, be of interest to remember that the queen's abdomen has six segments, and if she used the valve-like structure over the entrance to the spiracles in each segment as a vibrating mechanism similar to our vocal chords, then it is possible that the piping might be produced in this way. Each segment, acting as a resonator, being a little smaller than the preceding one, would allow the six notes to be of slightly different frequencies. As a result of these and other experiments I feel sure now that bees can hear. The fact that they have not an ear drum is certainly a difficulty, but it may be that the whole of the chitinous surface of the bee acts as a resonating drum to the chordotonal organs in the legs. It has been suggested that perhaps bees are in reality sensitive to vibration of a very high periodicity: indeed, perhaps they are able to perceive ultrasonic vibrations like the bats. I have endeavoured by means of electrical filters in the microphone-loudspeaker circuit to get some evidence on this point but up to the present the evidence is negative. We can say then, I think, that bees can hear sounds which are of biological interest to them, such as the piping of the queen. One further point emerges from work by Vanderplank, quoted by Butler8, that drones appear to be sensitive to sounds of a particular frequency, because if a Galton whistle is blown near a hive and frequencies of some 420 cycles per second produced, numbers of drones will fly out of the hive towards the source of sound. * * H« H« H« I mentioned earlier that Dr. Butler's lecture to the Society in 1945 dealt with 604</page><page sequence="9">гдтн june 1 95 1 regent research on bees and beekeeping the behaviour of bees while foraging, and since then a further insight has been obtained into the behaviour of individual bees working on a crop of mixed flowers. It has been known since the time of Rösch11 that there is a fairly well-defined division of labour within the hive. We know, for instance, that some of the duties within the hive can be equated to the age of the bee, in days, as in Table I : TABLE I. 1-3 days: cleans the cells. 3-6 days: feeds the older brood. 4-10 days: feeds the younger brood. 10-12 days: feeds the queen. 12-18 days: waxmakers. 18-20 days: guards. 21 days onwards: forager. This is, in outline, the division of labour within the hive ; but what is the division of labour outside the hive ? How is the work of pollen gathering, water collection y and nectar collection, etc. divided among the various ages of foragers ? And what is it that determines that one bee shall go out to collect nectar and another to collect pollen? We have gone a little way along the road of elucidating these problems, of recent years. Working with marked bees, and observing an individual bee's progress in a mixed flower garden, Ribbands12 in 1949 showed that bees in the field are continually selecting and choosing their flowers in regard to pollen or nectar collection, and they will remain faithful to one variety of flowers only as long as it yields good dividends in either pollen or nectar (Figure 4). C. G. Butler13 in the last lecture on bees to the Royal Society of Arts in 1945, to which I have referred, described observations which led him to put forward a theory to account for the behaviour of bees while foraging. He took the view that the foragers could be divided into three main classes in regard to their areas of foraging, the "fixed" bees, the "scout" bees and the "wandering" bees.. We got the picture of some foragers having a fixation area, an area of flowers which absorbed the attention of certain bees until either the bees died or the nectar in the blossoms was exhausted. These were the "fixed" bees. The "scout" bees were those which, driven further and further afield, were trying to find an area of blossoms not occupied by "fixed" bees and on which they themselves could fix their attention for foraging. These "scout" bees were thought to be the young bees. And lastly the "wandering" bees that were trying to find a crop,, the direction of which had been communicated to them by the returning forage bees doing the von Frisch dance. The behaviour of bees in the field, on this view was determined very largely by a simple, rigid, total reflex. Upon this theory was based the suggestion that it is better, for pollination r to place batteries of hives in an orchard thus increasing the wandering and scout population, who were mostly responsible for the cross pollination, rather than scattering the hive sites over the orchard. In 1949, however, Ribbands, from a patient study of individual marked bees, took a somewhat different view of the bee's foraging behaviour. According to this worker's observations, the behaviour 6°5</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 2ÇTH JUNE 1 95 1 of the bee while foraging was a good deal less rigid, and was governed by a con- tinuous exercise of choice by the bee. The forager chose the best portions of the best of any alternative crops, and continually compared the new crop with her memory of past crops. From this work we get the picture of the foraging bee, on a foraging trip, mainly confining her attention to one kind of flower, but every now and again, breaking off to sample the nectar or pollen of an adjacent flower. If, indeed, the sugar concentration or abundance of nectar in this second flower is greater than the first, then it may transfer its attentions entirely to this second crop. Flower fidelity is a characteristic of the honey bee, and this is what makes it such a valuable pollinating agent, but it is not absolutely faithful to one kin d of flower. For it was shown by Miss Betts14, analyzing pollen loads, that a mixed load was found in 3 per cent of the specimens examined. It would appear also that foraging bees graduate from pollen gathering to nectar gathering. Indeed, if pollen gathering bees are caught on the alighting board and given an anaesthetic dose of carbon dioxide, then afterwards they will forsake pollen gathering altogether, and will become nectar gatherers subsequently. They will do this in spite of the fact that nectar loads take up to twenty times as long as pollen loads to collect. Nevertheless, it has been found that bees may work pollen crops in the morning and nectar crops in the afternoon, when these begin to yield, and in this the bee is greatly assisted by the time sense which is so well developed in bees. (Beling15). The question of the pollen supply and its importance to bees, has come very much to the front during the last year or two. It used to be thought that a supply of pollen in the brood combs in the winter was undesirable, since it tends to stimulate brood rearing prematurely. This is now known not to be the case. Indeed, it has been shown by Maurizio16, subject to certain conditions, that the length of a bee's foraging life depends on the amount and quality of pollen that it fed upon as a nurse bee. This worker has shown that taking pollen from 26 different plants she was able to divide them up into those pollens which actively stimulated the pharyngeal glands of the nurse bees and those that did not. In most cases those pollens that stimulated the pharyngeal glands of the nurse bees also produced "long-lived" bees. One can divide pollens into those that are active in these respects and those that are inactive or only slightly active, as in Table II : TABLE II. STIMULANT EFFECT OF POLLENS UPON THE PHARYNGEAL GLANDS AND FAT BODY Pollens - inactive or Pollens- active ' sUghtìy active Crocus !

Poppy I 606</page><page sequence="11">2ÇTH JUNE 1 95 1 RECENT RESEARCH ON BEES AND BEEKEEPING Maurizio found that pollen feeding with an active pollen caused a newly emerged bee to develop its pharyngeal glands and fat body, and even in summer to attain a fat body, after a time, of a size equal to that found in winter bees. It was found also that a queenless colony even in summer, because the nurse bees had no brood to feed, took on the long life characteristics of winter bees. If a queen is introduced into such a stock and brood rearing starts again, then the pharyngeal glands of the nurse bees become rapidly exhausted ; so also does the fat body, showing that the protein reserves are being rapidly used up. Thus the bee ages and becomes transformed into a "short-lived" summer- flying bee with exhausted pharyngeal glands and undeveloped fat body. We see, therefore, that pollen collection is of the utmost importance to the well-being of the colony and it is now generally agreed that adequate pollen reserves are essential for a colony to winter satisfactorily, and are even more important than honey reserves in the autumn, since upon the pollen depends the subsequent length of life of the forager bee and the development of the pharyngeal glands. Pollen substitutes have been used a great deal in the United States because of the shortage of natural pollen there in the early part of the year. The question as to whether the bees are able to make use of the protein of pollen substitutes has often been raised. Maurizio found that the pollen substitutes, soya bean flour and dried skimmed milk, were not so efficient as naturally occurring pollens in producing long-lived bees, but they did stimulate the development of the pharyn- geal glands as well as naturally occurring pollen. I mention this recent work of Maurizio at some length, partly because of its basic importance, and partly because it has caused us to alter our ideas about the factors influencing the length of a bee's life. This work suggests that the longevity of bees is determined not entirely, or even primarily, by the enormous amount of work done by bees as foragers, but rather on the pollen consumed by the bee as a nurse bee. Another aspect of pollen collection by bees that has attracted attention during the last year or two, has been the colour of pollen loads. The colour of pollen loads varies even when bees are working the same plants, and several of the factors causing these variations have been suggested in a B.B.K.A. Research Committee's Report by D. Hodges17. The colour of pollen loads is usually different from that of the pollen grains found on the flower itself. This may be partly due to the moistening with honey by the bee of the pollen before packing it into its pollen baskets, or it might be due to the physical packing of the pollen layers and the changes in colour produced by reflection or diffraction of light from the pollen loads themselves. Bee-visits to old blossoms, on the one hand, and to newly opened blossoms on the other, have been found to cause a variation in colour of the pollen loads; as has also damp or dry weather, or the possibility of the admixture of a little soot or rust in the pollen load. Indeed it has been recorded by Reiter18 that the flower of purple loosestrife {Lythrum Salicaria L.) has some anthers that are longer than the others and these have bottle green 607</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 2ÇTH JUNE I951 pollen grains, whereas the shorter anthers on the same flower have primrose- yellow pollen grains. When the bee visits this flower these mixed pollen colours produce a green pollen load which turns brown on keeping for a few hours. It seems, therefore, that no definitive colour chart of pollen load colours can be produced, because of these curious colour variations, within a colour range of pollen loads from the same flower (Figure 5). Wintering, and the best method of wintering bees, are matters on which the opinions of beekeepers differ a great deal. For instance, is it better to winter bees in single-walled hives or double-walled hives; with much packing or little packing, or perhaps none at all? In order to answer some of these questions the B.B.K. A. Research Committee, during the last year or two, has organized a survey of wintering methods used by beekeepers, covering the winters of the years 1947-48 and 1948-49. The number of beekeepers "who took part, and the number of colonies, etc., are shown in Table III : TABLE III.

Unfortunately, however, very few colonies were reported dead, and those that were so reported died from disease or starvation, neither of which causes can be ¡directly ascribed to single- or double-walled hives. We, therefore, are still not able to answer the question; although one interesting fact has come out of this wintering survey. It would seem that the more packing we put on a hive for wintering, the more likely are we to get mouldy combs on the outside of the brood nest; and this is more likely to happen in single-walled hives, if these have a large amount of packing, than in double- walled hives with a similar amount of packing. This point is brought out in Table IV: 608</page><page sequence="13">2QTH JUNE 195 1 RECENT RESEARCH ON BEES AND BEEKEEPING TABLE IV.

This method of wintering bees, viz., with a crownboard only and a vigorous current of through ventilation, is one that is coming into increasingly common use in this country, although it must be admitted that in some other countries, notably Switzerland, this method is not favoured. Of recent years a new method of detecting minute quantities of substances in a mixture, known as paper partition chromatography, has been introduced, and by means of this method a fresh attack has been made upon the varieties of sugars in nectar. Indeed, several new sugars have been found in nectar and their manu- facture by the plant is being worked out. By this method, also, the amino acids19 in different varieties of pollen have been determined, and this may lead to some eluci- dation of the proteins in pollen that cause hay fever. Micro-chemical analysis has also detected, and iso- lated, a substance in royal jelly which is thought to be responsible for the difference between the development of a queen and a worker. The queen larva is fed upon royal jelly containing small F IGURE 5 . A foraging bee packing pollen into its corviculœ whilst hovering over the open poppy flower 609</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 2ÇTH JUNE 1 95 1 amounts of this substance for nine days, until her cell is sealed. This sub- stance is produced by the pharyngeal glands of the nurse bees, and according to Gontarski20 should be fed to a queen larva from the moment the egg is hatched, otherwise intermediate forms between the queen and worker are produced, and the queen is an inferior queen. It was considered by Zander that a worker embryo up to 36 hours old, would develop satisfactorily into a queen if transferred to a queen cell. According to the recent work of Gontarski, however, under these conditions, intermediate forms between queen and worker are produced, affecting such structures as the mandibles, hind legs, sting, tongue and even its behaviour, and these can be detected by the worker bees at an early stage. Gontarski also emphasizes the advantage of using punched cells, and points out that a larva which is to become a queen receives the food specific to a queen larva only after the cell has been altered in shape to become a queen cell. If these findings are confirmed it is clear that queen rearers will have to reconsider their technique, since the practice now, usually, is to graft from a larva up to 36 hours old. While on this subject of queen rearing a word should be said on instrumental insemination of queen bees. This is a technique which is now practised fairly widely although it is not a method for use by the ordinary beekeeper, but should be limited to queen rearers and research stations. One of the difficulties of maintaining a pure strain of queens has always been the control of mating, since normal mating occurs in the air. The earlier workers in this field obtained their spermatozoa from selected drones by a syringe and injected it into the genital passages of the queen. These earlier workers achieved only a partial success for the reason that we now know to be connected with the anatomy of the queen. It was Laidlaw21 who first drew attention to a valve- fold in the vagina of the queen. This valvefold had to be depressed in order that the spermatozoa of the drone could be injected by syringe into the median oviduct of the queen. When this is done a very large percentage of successful inseminations can be achieved. It is not my purpose here to go into details of technique, but suffice it to say that the queen is held in a special glass tube and anaesthetized by means of a flow of C02 passing over her. The vaginal opening of the queen is held open by means of hooks and the valvefold depressed ventrally, the tip of the micro-syringe is then passed over the valvefold into the medium oviduct and 6 to 10 c.mm. of drone semen injected. After the queen has been inseminated, she is taken out of the queen holder and dropped straight into the nucleus from which she was taken, still under the effects of carbon dioxide. In this condition she is less likely to be balled by the bees themselves. The object of the C02 is not only to act as an anaesthetic but it also stimulates the queen to begin laying earlier. For instance, inseminated queens which have been treated with C02 will begin to lay as soon as naturally mated queens, but without C02 80 per cent of the queens will take four weeks or longer to commence to lay (Mackensen22). The effect of the C02 seems, also, to have another property, that is of taking the queen past the urge to fly and mate naturally. It has been found by Thompson that after two 610</page><page sequence="15">2ÇTH JUNE 1 95 1 RECENT RESEARCH ON BEES AND BEEKEEPING applications of C02 there is no need to keep inseminated queens captive with a queen excluder in the hive, since the C02 has caused them to lose their urge to fly on a natural mating flight. A point of interest that has come to light in inseminating queens is that black queens inseminated with semen from yellow drones on the first occasion, and semen from black drones on the second occasion, produce workers of two distinct colours. They all emerge in batches of several hundreds, first one colour and then the other ; which seems to indicate that spermatozoa do not readily mix in the spermatheca, but remain in relatively tightly packed clusters. It may possibly be that the eggs are fertilized en masse in the oviduct and not one at a time as is generally supposed. A queen was inseminated with semen from drones raised by laying workers in worker cells; the brood and workers produced appeared quite normal. Drone-laying queens inseminated instrumentally laid fertile eggs and these produced normal worker bees. The technique of instrumental insemination has brought to light the occurrence of multiple matings in the queen bee. These occur within a day or two of one another. Formerly it was firmly believed that the virgin queen flew from the hive to be mated only once. It was estimated by Cheshire that in the spermatheca of a naturally mated queen there were about five million sperms, and, as the queen was considered to be able to lay about million eggs in her lifetime, the spermatheca! pump of the queen must be capable of discharging on to the egg as small a parcel of sperms as 5-10 at each fertilization. Table V, given below (after Mackensen and Roberts), shows the number of sperms in the spermatheca of the naturally mated and the instrumentally inseminated queens: TABLE V.

This number can only be approached by three or four instrumental inseminations of 2-5 c.mm. of semen each time. As has already been said, instrumental insemination is not for the amateur beekeeper, but its success, during the last year or two, has been of great value in research and is helping queen breeders to overcome one of their major difficulties, the control of the male parentage of queen bees. Each advance, however, brings certain disadvantages of its own in its train, and queen rearers will have to take notice of the phenomenon known as hybrid vigour. This, in short, is the vigour that is lost by continual inbreeding, and which can only be restored by recrossing strains. Indeed, it has been shown that by line breeding of bees by instrumental insemination, i.e. brothers and sisters mating, the fertility of queens is reduced 50 per cent in five generations. That is to say that if 100 workers are produced from 100 eggs in the first generation, after five generations only 50 workers are produced satisfactorily; the others are malformed, ill-deveíoped, or non-viable for some other reason. This is a similar phenomenon to that found in plant breeding experience. In research, instrumental insemination is helping to elucidate many problems of the genetics of bees; problems that have always been complicated by the occurrence of that remarkable phenomenon, parthenogenesis. * * H« * * * In reviewing these several aspects of beekeeping, I have had in mind those topics that have appeared to me to be growing points in our knowledge of the craft. During the last few years we have learned a great deal about the ability of bees to communicate with one another inside the hive. We know more about the senses of bees and their appreciation of the world around them. A broad vista is being opened up in our knowledge of bee behaviour particularly while they are foraging. And the more we learn about the ways of bees, the more do we appreciate the words of Shakespeare in King Henry V : So work the honey bees9 Creatures that by a rule in nature teach The act of order to a peopled kingdom . DISCUSSION MR. John YOXALL : Would Dr. Gooding accord to bees the ability to reason ? the lecturer : In so far as they exercise choice, perhaps so : I have always main- tained that bees, being insects, act merely by instinct ; an instinctive pattern is one that starts from the beginning and goes on to the end, and it cannot be varied. This is a very big subject, and it leads me into a difficulty in view of the fact that I mentioned that bees, foraging in the field, do exercise choice in regard to factors like the con- centration and abundance of sugar. I do not think that that really constitutes intelligence, and you will find in many lower forms of life that there will be an attraction to one form of food because it is more advantageous than another. 612</page><page sequence="17">39TH JUNE 1 95 1 RECENT RESEARCH ON BEES AND BEEKEEPING MR. G. A. taylor : I would like to ask a question on artificial insemination. Is it not a fact that after this has been carried out you cannot keep your queen pure or produce pure bees, because, as we now know, the queen will mate a second and third time, , and probably even more often than that. the lecturer: In cases of artificial insemination the queen is treated with carbon dioxide, and it seems that the effect of the carbon dioxide is that when she is put back again into the nucleus from which she is taken, she does not feel the inclination to go out again and be mated naturally. It has been found that there is absolutely no need to prevent a queen, after one insemination, from flying out again. It is therefore not true to say that you will not be able to keep the strain pure as the queen will probably be mated again ; in fact she will not go out again to mate. Lieut. John F. a. Thompson, R.N.R. : I would like to ask Dr. Gooding a question about the queen bee which was once thought to produce drone eggs, apart from drone mating, from her own unmated effort, while producing workers by the action of drone insemination. Has Dr. Gooding any modification to make on this theory, that the queen has to be inseminated to produce workers but not to produce drones, and that the type of drone follows the queen. тщ: lecturer: Yes, that is a very interesting question. I think all the modern work bears out the view that the drone, the male honey bee, is produced by the queen without the queen being fertilized, with, in fact, half the number of chromosomes in the nucleus of its cells to be found in those of the ordinary worker bee. Here is a male creature that is produced and is viable and is functional without fertilization of thé female egg. When the female egg is fertilized by the male element, then the number of chromosomes becomes double, in the normal way, and a worker bee is produced. I think all the present work on instrumental insemination bears that out, although, of course, this view is many years old. It is borne out, also, by two of the facts that I mentioned during my lecture: one was that a queen that is producing drones, if fertilized artificially, will produce workers ; the other fact is, I think, that worker bees, if they are left queenless for a time, will develop into laying worker bees, and these will only produce drones. If the semen from these drones is used for the artificial insemination of normal queens, normal workers are produced. This bears out the views of days gone by. MR. g. le maistre: I would like to ask Dr. Gooding two questions: one is, has any experimental work been done in regard to the third characteristic of the bee ? He mentioned the two useful ones, the pollination and the honey gathering, and the third was the stinging. It would be very helpful if we had bees that were a little less apt to lose their tempers when one is a little bit careless. I do not know if any work has been done on that. The other question I would like to ask is, has any experimental work been done in regard to temperature control which some Americans have started to talk about? the lecturer: I doubt whether we are really interested in getting a bee that does not sting; I do not think we want that sort of bee, because she could not defend her stores adequately, and I would get even less honey than I get now, if that were the case. But what we are very interested in, and there has been a great deal of work done on this, is the way that susceptibility to bee stings varies, both with different people, and with the same people at different times. I have been particularly interested in this because I have come to the conclusion that it is not just a special protein in the venom of the bee that gives rise to these effects that are so unpleasant, but it is a bee protein as such. There are some people, of course, who swell up violently with one bee sting, and we might call these people susceptible; if you inject a susceptible person with a watery extract of drones - drones that have no sting at all - these people react in 613</page><page sequence="18">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 29TH JUNE 1 95 1 exactly the same way as if they had been stung by a bee. Now that shows that it is the bee protein itself that is the operative thing, and not a special protein in the venom. With regard to temperature control, I do not know anything specially about that. major alan D. simmons : In answer to an earlier question Dr. Gooding said that laying workers produced drones only, but I believe that Mr. Mackensen in America, and Dr. Butler in this country, have had laying workers which produced normal queens which have subsequently produced normal workers. the lecturer: Yes, this does occur, and it occurs more frequently than we used to think. In some strains of bees nearly 50 per cent of the unfertilized eggs turn out to be females. There is a good reason for this: it is a genetic reason, and it is difficult, like all these genetic things, to understand. But we can put it in a nutshell by saying that in these cases there has been a failure of the Reduction Division. I have no doubt that you know what that means. MR. g. a. Taylor : Has Dr. Gooding any information with regard to the spermatozoon entering the egg? It was always believed to enter through the micropyle; but after reading an article in the Microscope , by F. J. Manning, which points out that the sperm is spiked and gains entry through the egg and not through the micropyle, I feel compelled to alter my conclusions. the lecturer : I have no certain information about that, I am afraid. MR. j. L. hurford: Some years ago, when I was in a pleasure steamer in Brighton, I saw on part of the iron structure of the pier, which was wet and slimy, a cast of bees about two yards above the sea level. Could Dr. Gooding give us some idea why they should choose such a place to swarm ? the lecturer : I think I must fall back on the statement that I have just made, that bees have no intelligence ! I think that would answer the question as well as anything, because clearly one has got to be a bee for a bit to know why they do stupid things like that. MR. s. w. everest: Could Dr. Gooding give us any of the latest views about the ventilation of hives in the winter ? the lecturer: The latest view is that the more hives are ventilated in the winter the better. We have tried to get a little evidence on this by making a survey throughout the country (when I say "we" I mean the B.B.K.A. Research Committee) of what beekeepers do when they keep their bees : how many inches of sacking they put on top, whether, in fact, they put any sacking on at all, whether they leave the top open, and so on. I think the point emerges - though this survey method is a very difficult one from which to get any concrete conclusions - that there is a suggestion that the more sacking you put on top of a hive the worse it is for the bees ; that is, the more mouldy combs you will get. It seems too, from the results, that single-walled hives are worse in that one particular than double- walled hives. MR. charles edward reading: We are told, in fact I think it is the case, that if in the winter bees are left without top covering they do not seem to mind, indeed they thrive ; yet if you place a loose quilt on top, or a covering with slight cracks in it, the bees will stick it down, or close them up, with propolis and cut out any possible draught. How are these facts to be reconciled? the lecturer: I do not know quite how to answer that. Bees, in nature, would probably live in a hollow tree; they would line the hollow of that tree with gum, and they would leave open their ventilation hole through which, usually, they get in and out. I do not know that one can really say very much more about it ; you have to be careful in these questions not to be anthropomorphic. I think if I were to try 614</page><page sequence="19">2ÇTH JUNE I95 1 RECENT RESEARCH ON BEES AND BEEKEEPING to give a satisfactory answer to that question, I should find myself thrusting upon the mind of the bee what I want the bee to think. MR. H. j. wadey: May I suggest that the last question was perhaps not framed quite accurately. If a tiny hole, or a series of tiny holes, is left in the covering over the bees the bees will close it, but if the holes are as big as bees, then they will not. The bee seems to like to have holes through which it can pursue its smaller enemies and parasites such as wax moths and earwigs, but it will not tolerate a hole through which other creepy-crawlies can walk, and the bee cannot follow. If the questioner leaves the feed hole of the hive open, or even a much more substantial hole than that, he will find that the bees will not attempt to close it ; it is when people put perforated zinc over the feed hole, with the idea of keeping the bees down and giving them some ventilation, that they close the holes. mrš. HILLIARD : I was particularly interested in Dr. Gooding's account of the use of carbon dioxide as an anaesthetic for artificial insemination because I have wondered what the bees really do when they ball their queen ? I understand they cluster very tightly round her; are they in fact increasing the COa concentration and anaesthetizing her, thus using the most painless method of bringing about her demise ? the lecturer: That is a very ingenious question; I have not thought about it. Carbon dioxide acts as an anaesthetic, which is a thing that most people recover from, I am glad to say. But the queen in the middle of this mass of bees never recovers, as far as I know. From that point of view I would say that the evidence is against her being anaesthetized. mrš. HILLIARD : I am a complete novice, I am about to start beekeeping with my first lot of bees, but I understand that if you rescue a queen when she is in the process of being balled she will be torn by the bees before you can get her out ; one bee sits on the back of her neck and pushes her head down. It is not the act of rescuing her that damages her. Perhaps the C02 content, which must increase in this process, is used before they damage her in any other way. the lecturer: The novice always asks the most difficult question! I think really they damage the queen in pressing round her, which points to her not being just anaesthetized. I do not think it is a question of anaesthetization. MR. h. s. Thompson : We have, I think, nothing but mongrel bees left in this country now; is it possible, in Dr. Gooding's opinion, that we will be able to get back to pure-bred bees by selective breeding ? the lecturer: Yes, I think it is. We have just heard a difficult question from a novice, and now we have another difficult question from somebody who knows more about instrumental insemination than I do myself. But I think it would be a very good thing for beekeeping in this country if we could get back to the original bee that inhabited this island. We have a considerable mixture of bees nowadays, Italians and Dutch, and goodness knows what different kinds, and the old British Black Bee, as it was called, was wiped out, of course, by Isle of Wight disease ; but it was very well adapted to the peculiar climate of this country. I believe there is no reason why you should not line breed and, every now and then, infuse hybrid vigour into that line breeding by a cross ; because, you know, the hybrid vigour comes back at once, whereas it takes five generations of in-breeding to lose 50 per cent of it. MR. G. s. marsh: Dr. Gooding said that the vitality of the strain decreased if you crossed brother and sister ; I would like to know how he arranges such a crossing, assuming that the brother and sister are progeny of the same parent. What I really mean is that it would be almost impossible to have brother and sister alive at the same time, because the genetic type of the bee female is different from that of the male. 6l5</page><page sequence="20">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 2ÇTH JUNE 1 95 1 the lecturer: What I was referring to, of course, was the male and female of the same generation. I quite agree that there are really no brothers and sisters because the drone has no father and has only one grandfather. MR. G. R. M. garratt: Would Dr. Gooding agree that the danger of bringing disease into this country by importing bees is sufficiently great to make this import undesirable ? the lecturer : I would say on the evidence that the answer to that is, no. I thought at one time that probably there was a danger to the bees of this country from the importation of bees. But when one considers the evidence about the health of foreign bees - and the bees are, from some countries, very carefully checked, and have a health certificate which is issued by a body which is quite independent of the exporter - one finds that it is not possible to sustain the argument that disease is being brought into this country by the importation of bees. MRS. M. L. colthurst: Could Dr. Gooding tell us whether any work has been done to discover how bees recognize so very quickly when the queen is with them and when she is not? Two incidents have happened which make me ask. On one occasion I saw a swarm coming from a small hive ; I went to it and listened, and the queen - a virgin queen - within, was making a shrill, frantic, continuous piping - a most exciting noise. The piping stopped suddenly, and the queen - I had been hoping to lift her from the alighting board - shot out, and the bees, which had been circling, began, within about thirty seconds, to cluster on a tree. On another occasion I took the queen from the alighting board of a large stock that was swarming; she came out about two thirds of the way through the swarm - she did not want to come out, apparently, and tried to go back twice but the bees jostled her. I took her off the alighting board and put her in a box in my pocket, and in a few minutes the head of the swarm was pouring back to the hive. The tail of the swarm was not out, and there was a most incredible congestion in front of the hive. It seems to me an extraordinary thing that the bees can recognize the presence or the absence of a queen so quickly even when they are in the air. the lecturer: That is an extraordinarily interesting question. I do not think any work has been done on this. It is a subject which should, of course, be given a lot of careful thought. It was a matter that interested Henri Fabre many years ago ; he also noticed how quickly the bees - in the hive in his case - noticed the absence of the queen. He thought it was through a sense of smell, but I do not know any evidence for this, one way or the other. A vote of thanks to the Lecturer was carried with acclamation ; and , another having been accorded to the Chairman , the meeting terminated . REFERENCES 1. K. von Frisch : Experientia, 1946, p. 1. 2.
