<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Beasts of the Modem Imagination: Darwin, Nietzsche, Kafka, Ernst, &amp; Lawrence. By Margot Norris. Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985. Pp. xiv + 266. $26.50. Margot Norris stalks her subject with erudite vocabulary, critical sophistica- tion, and bristling analyses of a recondite range of sources. She invents new terms (biocentric, disanthropic) to play off against familiar ones (anthropocentric, mis- anthropic), just as she creates a new tradition to challenge previous ones, reveal- ing unexpected affinities between Darwin and the modernists she treats. Norris's book will create difficulties for her readers not only because it draws upon each of the disciplines of science, philosophy, literature, and art, but also because it forces us to think about ourselves in a new way. She makes us aware of the imprisoning act of creating cultural traditions, of subjugating the wild beast in ourselves. Though we glibly acknowledge a post-Darwinian consciousness of our an- cestry, most of us still act as though we had nothing in common with animals. Norris exposes this anthropocentrism by explaining our alienation from biocen- tric works; they seem odd to us, and Norris's interest in them seems idiosyn- cratic. Furthermore, Norris treats experimental works by these authors not gen- erally considered central to their canons (especially Kafka's animal stories and Lawrence's St. Mawr) because in these works they most explicitly and self-reflex- ively attack the anthropomorphic conventions of novelistic representation. Nor- ris argues that precisely in these antimonumental "minor works" do we find the most radical thinking of these authors. Similarly, in her analysis of the "minor" tradition of biocentrism, Norris in fact makes a new and central contribution to the history of ideas. For one thing, she redefines our sense of Darwin, making us see that his writings, especially his recently published notebooks, contain philosophic facets that have not been treated by traditional historians of science. His attack on anthropomorphic form, and the normative thinking it represents, explicitly and fully undermines notions of Platonic unity and teleonomic or mechanical design governing organic mor- phology. We may have too readily accepted these ideas, forgetting what Norris describes as the "imaginative adventure that invaded [Darwin] with a sense of otherness, a spirit of the wild, a feeling of alienation, or at least separation, from culture that allowed him to imagine the seeming impossibilities that became his theory" (p. 33). Norris reflects Darwin's alienation when she defines the key term of biocen- trism in opposition to Hegel's notion of the "other": instead of valuing cultural artifacts that confer status and power, biocentric thinkers value the natural power and fullness of being possessed by animals. Biocentric authors do not feel the lack or insecurity that causes anthropocentric culture to imitate external authority 108 Book Reviews</page><page sequence="2">through idealization. They create, as animals do, out of inherent power and not a need for the status acquired through rhetorical persuasion. But only humans create art, so biocentric art must simultaneously display animalistic vitality and dismantle anthropocentric mimesis. Norris acknowledges the irony of a biocentrism that produces "a most cerebrally convoluted art of multi-layered obliquities and self-destructive feints" (p. 222). At times this creates difficulties; Norris must frequently point out how Kafka and Ernst undermine the very premises of representation upon which their art might at first seem to de- pend. But she gains by her analysis of anti-representational, disanthropic art a new and powerful concept distinguishing biocentrism from the more frequently encountered, anthropomorphic use of "animal imagery." Art that resists culture also resists the mediation of influence, and each of these authors defiantly proclaims his individuality. On the surface, the notion of a biocentric tradition would seem an oxymoron, at best a loose grouping of can- tankerous and reclusive rebels. Yet Norris overcomes this obstacle to create a nexus of ideas clearly shared by these writers and to demonstrate a previously unrecognized development of Darwin's ideas. Norris traces the lines of influence primarily through Nietzsche's reading of Darwin. She uses a Derridean perspective to read both Darwin and Nietzsche as formulating a revolutionary notion of mimesis; nature becomes a textual free- play of signs indicating not intelligence, but the trans-human agents of force and desire. Nietzsche shares with Darwin the radical view of human behavior as governed by irrational, unconscious, vitalistic forces more than intelligence, even though he misreads Darwin as viewing adaptation and the struggle for survival optimistically, in contrast to his own fatalistic view. In tracing the influence of Darwin through Nietzsche to modern artists, Norris significantly extends the possibilities of relating science to literature, going beyond the used of nature as metaphor. The biocentric agenda was "to devise in- tellectual equivalents for the ontological condition of animal life" (p. 225), to speak as animals. They found ways to repeal metaphor by engaging its literal level directly. They make us recognize the repression involved in the substitution of metaphoric meaning for literal image. When Nietzsche speaks of the need to in- gest meat and to know through one's palate what one may safely eat, he literally means meat and not "food for thought" (p. 92). Josephine the mouse, in Kafka's story, learns not to sing and thus enacts Kafka's fatalistic resignation to the failure of representation. By connecting science and literature in this generalized, antirepresentational, antianthropomorphic sense, Norris claims for biocentrism conventions that also derive from other traditions. She analyzes Ernst's mutilated bodies and hybrid forms as revealing a Darwinian undermining of telos in evolution through the disclosure of amorphous and intriguingly sporadic animal structures. But one might question their connection to Darwin. They seem closer to the iconography Book Reviews 109</page><page sequence="3">of medieval art, and they depict fantastic monsters that no theory of atavistic traits or random mutation could conceive. Some of her examples do indeed suggest im- aginative figurations of Darwinian mutations, but Norris extends her category to include other examples that have no animal imagery. Similarly, she explores Kafka's "In the Penal Colony" and "The Hunger Artist" as well as his animal stories. Given the coherence of her arguments, this does not damage the logic of her concept of biocentricity, but it does decrease its specificity. Lawrence and Hemingway give Norris her clearest examples- the one positive, the other negative-of biocentric art. Lawrence presents a horse, St. Mawr, who represents all that the social world rejects and who speaks in a language beyond metaphoric imitation. Hemingway appears to celebrate the power of the bull, in Death in the Afternoon, but in fact celebrates the "science" of bullfighting, the status of the matador, and the aesthetics of the cultural rite. He presents atrocity as performance, unlike Kafka, who presents performance as atrocity. In both the case of Lawrence and that of Hemingway, Norris identifies a clear relationship of human metaphor to the non-metaphoric language of animals, eschewing the ironic presence-through-absence she often claims to find in the works of Kafka and Ernst. Given the problem of defining what all of these thinkers and artists have in common, Norris, in her conclusion, admits to "some blurring of the boundaries between biocentric thought and the more vitalistic elaborations of other modern intellectual movements" (p. 236). She allies biocentrism with, but also distinguishes it from, the positivistic scientific rejection of philosophical idealism in the nineteenth century (for example in Mill, Dewey, and Bergson); the phenomenological emphasis on immediacy of experience (Husserl and Heideg- ger); and the Romantic rejection of bourgeois ideology (Goethe, Herder, Schell- ing, and Schopenhauer). These parallel traditions share some biocentric qualities but lack others. While no final list emerges, Norris does summarize her criteria for biocen- trism: philosophic concerns (an antiidealistic, antirational, antimetaphysical conception of Nature; a self-referential critique of anthropocentrism, a vitalistic equation of life with power and energy rather than with matter, and so on) married to an equally wide range of stylistic strategies (performative prose; devious logic or aggressive polemic; the use of animal or organic metaphors amid perspectival shifts; the text's refusal to seduce, concede, or ingratiate, and so forth). (p. 236) Clearly Norris's "and so on" "and so forth" indicate the partly ragged edges of the tradition. No group of artists united by a zealous commitment to a single purpose (the Futurists or the pre-Raphaelites for example) ever displays total unity among its manifestos and performances. Much less will a group of artists who abjure the social implications of a "tradition." But to fuss about the tightness of the category of biocentrism is to ignore the 110 Book Reviews</page><page sequence="4">power of Norris's book. She makes us aware of our animality and exposes the painful compromises with repressive authority we all accept and continue to en- force, no matter how "liberated." To be a beast in a cage may be the state we in- habit not metaphorically, as we often admit, but literally as well. John Hannay Georgia State University</page></plain_text>
