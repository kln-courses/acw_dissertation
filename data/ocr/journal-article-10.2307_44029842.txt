Chambers Recognizing the "mediated" form of Bowering's poetics enables one to see how his "American" debt to Olson can turn into an investigation of "Olson's debt." - Trent Keough My interpretation of Coetzee's novel and Rich's poem hangs on a crucial sign - an iconic sign which points back toward the physicality of the wreck itself. - Barbara Eckstein Against this Japanese Confucian/Buddhist tension, The Remains of the Day can be seen as a Buddhist critique of Confucianism.... characterized by a unique kind of comedy. - -John Rothfork In The Father, erotic metaphors serve not as "a respite" from the threat of death but as acknowledgment of the intimate consequences of looking at herfather's dying. - Laura E. Tanner Historical visions, of which the fin de siècle trope is one of the more charming, always present themselves as ineluctable. - - Charles Molesworth $7.00 The University of Manitoba</page></plain_text>
