<plain_text><page sequence="1">EMILY DICKINSON* By AUSTIN WARREN I THOMAS Johnson has produced what has long been de sired?a carefully edited and annotated complete text of Emily Dickinson's poems. It fills three large volumes. The format seems, and is, in congruous with the nature of Emily's poems, so characteristi cally and richly short?and, as Johnson remarks, always in re vision shortened, not lengthened. This is not the edition in which to enjoy Emily. I recall the pleasure of reading her in the slender gray volumes of the 1890's. For pleasure, as for edification, Emily should not be read in big tomes, or much of her at a time. Johnson prints 1775 poems. I felt the immediate need to reduce them to three hun dred or less. Many of her poems are exercises, or autobiographi cal notes, or letters in verse, or occasional verses. There are poems which are coy or cute; others which are romantically melodramatic. But the business of the scholar is to publish all the "literary remains," to establish a correct text, to elucidate obscure words or references,?whenever possible, by the citation of opposite passages from his writer's other poems or prose (in Emily's case, there are her own brilliant letters) ; to make possible the study of a poet's development by fixing, with what precision may be pos sible, the dates of composition. These tasks of an editor Johnson has carefully and satisfactorily fulfilled. To do them, it was necessary to have access to Emily Dickinson's original manuscripts,?her penciled jottings, her *The Poems of Emily Dickinson. Including variant readings critically compared with all known manuscripts. Edited by Thomas H. Johnson. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. 1955. 3 vols. $25.00.</page><page sequence="2">566 EMILY DICKINSON worksheets and the little stitched books or "packets" into which at intervals she collected her final or semi-final versions. These "packet" versions provide?when, as for the vast majority of the poems, they are available?the authoritative ttxt^ that of the author's most considered judgment. In the past, Emily Dickinson suffered from two sets of editors. Mrs. Todd could decipher Emily's handwriting; but she and Colonel Higginson, the minor poet and man of letters who be came Emily's half-reluctant mentor, felt the need to amend so far as they could Emily's deviations from normal educated usage ?her provincial words, her use of the subjunctive in subordinate clauses, her "inaccurate55 rhymes. Emily5s niece, Mme. Bianchi, less skilled at the handwriting, latterly difficult, was given to ex ploiting her aunt's strangeness. It used to be thought that Mme. Bianchi, who so shrewdly "discovered55 further poems at market able season, perhaps constructed some of the weaker ones; but this conjecture is tacitly refuted by a study of the originals. In "Notes on the Present Text,55 Johnson exhibits his fidelity to Emily5s spelling (some of it, like "Febuary," is notation of rural New England speech habits), her capitalization, and her punctuation. The latter are capricious. She inclines to capitalize nouns (after the fashion of Carlyle and the German language) ; her capitalization of adjectives cannot be reduced to principle. The dash is almost her exclusive mark of punctuation, exceeding much the latitude allowed to nineteenth century women. It sometimes stands for the comma, sometimes indicates the pause of anticipation or suspense, sometimes might be described as equi valent to the phrasing marks of music. But categories do not suffice. Take No. 344, for example: Twas the old?road?through pain? That unfrequented?one? With many a turn?and thorn? That stops?at heaven?</page><page sequence="3">AUSTIN WARREN 567 This?was the Town?she passed? There?where she?rested?last? Then?stepped more fast? The little tracks?close pressed. The dashes before "through pain," "and thorn," "at heaven," and "last" mark the pauses of suspense and anticipation. Those separating off "That unfrequented one," an appositive, might, in current use, be commas or dashes. Those at the ends of lines 5 and 6 stand for commas or semicolons. But what of the dashes separating "old" and "road," or "unfrequented" and "one," or "This" and "was," "There" and "where"? These seem designed to phrase: in the first two instances, indicating stress on both the adjective and the noun, in the last two, giving the stress of italics to '"This" and "There"; probably the enclosure of "rested" is also to ensure its being stressed. The dash in the eighth line seems intended to emphasize the seeming contradiction between "little" and "close pressed." I analyze this specimen to show both the oddity of Emily's pointing and also the difficulty of repunctuating it in any fashion which does not constitute an interpretation. Johnson says, "Quite properly such 'punctuation' can be omitted in later editions, and the spelling and capitalization regularized, as surely she would have expected had the poems been published in her lifetime." Editions for general reading should undoubtedly "regularize"; but how to treat Emily's punctuation is the difficult point. Apart from her periods, the overall effect of the dashes is either to re produce pauses in her own reading of the poems or to render the clauses and phrases a fluidity of transition lost by a rigid system. The best method I can propose is to omit?after the fashion of some contemporary poetry?all punctuation, or all save that of the period: a method which would not, in any case I can summon up, obscure the comprehension of her poetry. The poems, through no. 1648, are now presented in a chrono logical arrangement?the dating based partly on allusions to</page><page sequence="4">568 EMILY DICKINSON contemporary events, partly on the dates of letters in which they were enclosed, partly on the changes in Emily's handwriting (on which an "expert55 contributes a special essay), partly on the order of the "packets55 in which the final versions were placed, from the earliest packet, assembled in 1858, to the latest in 1872. The packet poems constitute two-thirds of her poetry. Nos. 1649-1775 Johnson does not attempt to date. These poems, for which no autograph copies exist, are printed from transcripts, chiefly those made by Emily's sister-in-law. Though properly put together, at the end of Vol. Ill, their authenticity can scarcely be doubted. They include a few of Emily Dickinson's snake poems and "Elysium is as far as to/The very nearest Room.55 Long ago I worked out my own chart of Emily's poetic de velopment, setting off as "early" the conventional and senti mental pieces, and using as my tests for the mature poems the increasing substitution for rhyme of assonance and consonance and the increasing freshness and precision of language. I pos tulated a consistency of method: expected the poems systematic ally to grow more Dickinsonian. Having achieved her manner, her best style, she could not, I supposed, have turned back to styles not so definitely hers. This theory was too neat. Emily did, to the end, "look back.55 Unlike Mozart and Beethoven and Hopkins and James, she had no "late manner55 so integrally held that she could not, in con science, deviate therefrom. This inconsistency was certainly helped by her ambiguous character of being a poet yet not a publishing poet. She never sharply differentiated between poetry and occasional verse and prose. The prose of her letters is so m?tonymie and metaphoric and cryptic as to be always the prose of a poet and thus to admit the intercalation of verse written as prose. In 1860, Emily wrote "If I shouldn't be alive/When the Robins come" with its admirable "trying/With my granite Lip55 and "How many times these low feet staggered/Only the sol</page><page sequence="5">AUSTIN WARREN 569 dered mouth can tell"; but in the same year she wrote the senti mental piece with its bit of Scots?probably represented for her by Burns?"Poor little Heart!/Did they forget thee?/Then dinna care!" and the balladic repetition of "That scalds me now ?that scalds me now" of no. 193. In 1861, she wrote "There's a certain slant of light" but also "Why?do they shut me out of heaven"?one of her "little girl" pieces. And in "about 1865" she wrote the quatrain, of which I italicize some words: To help our Bleaker parts Salubrious Hours are given Which if they do not fit for Earth Drill Silently for Heaven. She had written "Arrange the heart" and rejected it for "Drill silently"?an improvement both in sparing the "heart" and in giving the double-sensed drill (the martial discipline; the car penter's tool if not then the dentist's also). Yet at the same time she wrote "Let down the Bars, Oh Death," a tritely sentimental sheep-and-shepherd poem. Emily added to her styles without subtracting; and in maturity she wrote a new kind of poetry without relinquishing the liberty of slipping back into her earlier modes, II It used to be said of Emerson that his "bad" rhymes were due to a deficient ear?a theory once and for all disproved by the publication, in the first volume of Rusk's Lettersy of the earliest poems of Emerson, written in perfectly accurate heroic couplets. Even the early Whitman could rhyme and meter acceptably. And Emily's first known verses, written in the early 1850's, de monstrate likewise that her subsequent deviation was purposed. Her "Valentine" poem faithfully rhymes "swain" and "twain," "air" and "fair." But, having said that, I have to add that none</page><page sequence="6">570 EMILY DICKINSON of them would have become known as poets for these "correct55 productions. By intuition, and by relatively conscious theorizing, they had to create new kinds of poetry. Like Whitman, Emily took off from Emerson, whose Poems and Essays she owned and knew; but Whitman took off from Emerson's theory of the poet and his poetic and rhetorical essays; Emily, from Emerson5s own practice as a poet: his short-lined rhyming; his gnomic quatrains and gnomic short poems like "Brahma55; his "Hamatreya." This lineage from Emerson was blended with another line age?that of the hymnal. Several times she quotes Isaac Watts5 hymn beginning, "There is a land of pure delight55: Could we but climb where Moses stood And view the landscape o5er, Nor Jordan5s stream, nor death5s cold flood Should fright us from the shore; and the stanza, with its alternating 4 and 3, remains one of her metrical favorites. She creates a counterpoint or descant on Watts, relaxing the rhyming of lines 1 and 3 and the personal izing of Watts5 congregational pieces: 5Tis not the Dying hurts us so? 5Tis living?hurts us more? But Dying is a different way? A Kind behind the Door . . . Short meter, long meter, common meter?the standard hymn stanzas?are her mold, not to break but to render pliant. Emily's language is her own mixture of provincialisms, stan dard speech of her time, the concrete and the abstract, the words of young people and the theological words of orthodox preachers (e.g., infinite). Her use of language is almost unfailingly medi tated and precise. Worksheet drafts for a few of her poems pro</page><page sequence="7">AUSTIN WARREN 571 vide the list of alternatives from which she chose. In the poem on the Bible (no. 1545), the epithet finally elected?"warbling" ?was chosen out of these possible dissyllables: "typic, hearty, bonnie, breathless, spacious, tropic, warbling, winning, mellow." None of these dissyllables seems inevitable; but warbling?the unpremeditated singing of a bird or a rustic? seems the best candidate. Of a clergyman ("He preached upon 'Breadth' till it argued him narrow") she asserts satrically that Jesus would not know how to "meet so enabled a man," choosing her epithet from "learned, religious, accomplished, discerning, accoutred, estab lished, conclusive." Emily needs a trisyllabic word: but she certainly also distinguished it from "able" : to "enable" is legally, as by authority, to make one what, by nature, he is not: it sug gests the pretentiousness of borrowed righteousness or of learning extraneous to the personality. Previous editions have printed the last stanza of "I never saw a Moor" as I never spoke with God Nor visited in heaven? Yet certain am I of the spot As if the chart were given. Johnson reads, for the conventional "chart," the word "checks," in the colloquial sense of railroad tickets, quoting in adequate support Emily's prose, "My assurance of existence of Heaven is as great as though, having surrendered my checks to the con ductor, I knew that I had arrived there." In no. 391, "A Visitor in Marl," Mme. Bianchi's Unpublished Poems reads "March" for "Marl." Neither here nor when, in a note, he cites Emily's writing of her dead father as "lying in Marl," does Johnson gloss this unusual but accurate word. The "Visitor" is Death; and the word "Marl" means an earthy, crumbling deposit chiefly of clay, mixed with calcium carbonate, or earth (in the sense of clay) : it means the cadaver. These two examples will illustrate</page><page sequence="8">572 EMILY DICKINSON that Emily used the words she meant, and the gain of their resto ration. Ill As Allen T?te long ago remarked, Emily stands, among New Englanders, between Emerson and Hawthorne,?of whom she wrote that he "entices?appalls.55 Her rearing was in Trinitarian Congregationalism?often in New England villages referred to as?in contrast to Unitarian heresy?the Orthodox Church. Un like the rest of her family (some of whom capitulated early, some later), Emily never "joined the church,55 never would fix the content of her belief; but she knew what her neighbors and her pastor believed, and?like Emerson in his attacks on Harvard College?had the personal comfort and poetic license of cherish ing favorite scepticisms without supposing that they would under mine, and hence render impossible of attack, the solid faith of others, the solid force of institutions. She lacks Hawthorne5s sense of sin, and isolation for privacy is hardly an evil to her; the analogy to Hawthorne lies rather in her obsession with death and futurity,?still more the sense of mystery: as in the remark (put on the lips of Holgrave), "I begin to suspect that a man's bewilderment is the measure of his wisdom." Her deepest poems are metaphysical or tragic; her mode of vision symbolist?think ing in analogies. Emerson (whose Essays an early "tutor" gave her) may have flexed her mind, encouraged her speculations and her questionings of orthodoxy; but her mythology remains? what Hawthorne's was and Emerson's never?Biblical and Trini tarian. She is a rebel?but not, like Emerson, a schismatic. A third ancestor comes often to my mind,?Sir Thomas Browne, a writer dear to the 19th century New Englanders, es pecially to the Concord men, and known and cited by Emily. "For prose," she wrote Colonel Higginson, she had "Mr. Rus kin, Sir Thomas Browne, and the Revelations." These are very special kinds of prose certainly; and I don't hesitate to say that</page><page sequence="9">AUSTIN WARREN 573 Emily's poetic style is not only that of some Emerson poems ("The Humble Bee," "Hamatreya," "Mithridates," "Days") but that of Browne's Religio and Christian Morals. Her world view is the Brunonian sense of the natural world, so full of curious objects in the eyes of most men?though, as Browne re marks, he doesn't know how we can call the toad ugly when it was made by the express design of God to assume that shape. Nor is Emily going to simplify the complexity of a God who made the bat. Of the bat, Emily writes (1575): Deputed from what Firmament? Of what Astute Abode? Empowered with what Malignity Auspiciously withheld? To his adroit Creator Ascribe no less the praise? Beneficent, believe me, His Eccentricities. Browne heaps up technical difficulties which beset the accept ance of the Bible and orthodox theology: he delights to list such difficulties as occasioned Bishop Colenso (of Arnoldian memory) the loss of his faith?the statistics of an Ark capable of holding all the creatures said to have entered. Emily's most characteristic difficulties are with the morals of the Bible, especially of the Old Testament,?which in her time and place had not been subjected to the "Higher Criticism." She "knew her Bible" well, the total Bible: it was her prime myth ology. She neither rejects nor accepts it without question and reservation. Its histories are rich and plausible human docu ments; its doctrinal books, like St. Paul's epistles, are testimonials for consideration, propose questions and speculations for her theological sensibility to ponder. She would have been shocked equally by having the Bible treated as negligible, or even as "literature," or by accepting it as an infallible silencer of specu lation.</page><page sequence="10">574 EMILY DICKINSON Her famous "The Bible is an antique volume" was originally written for her nephew Ned and given the title, "Diagnosis of the Bible, by a Boy"; but the boy was not alien to the woman who understood his boredom and his bafflement: the final version is hers. The Bible is an antique Volume? Written by faded Men At the suggestion of Holy Spectres? Sub j ects?Bethlehem? Eden?the ancient Homestead? Satan?the Brigadier? Judas?the Great Defrauder? David?the Troubadour? Sin?a distinguished Precipice Others must resist? Had but the tale a warbling Teller? All the boys would come? Orpheus' Sermon captivated? It did not condemn. The sympathy with Satan and Judas is for rebels against laws they don't understand, or it comes from a feeling that, since sin must needs come into the world, and since the Crucifixion was foretold and necessary, we should not be too hard on the unhappy perpetrators. The mushroom is a "Judas Iscariot" to the rest of Nature. Elsewhere (no. 120) she remarks that there are shocking instances of God's injustice: "Moses wasn't fairly used; Ananias wasn't." But it's temerarious to make such protestations. The same God who made the Lamb made the Lion: He who provided good and suffers the little ones to come unto Him also permits sin and evil?that "where Sin abounded, Grace may much more abound." There have been times in which the pious felt the need to de fend God, to prop Him up,?as though it were our business to support the Rock and Word and Comforter. Emily is too ortho</page><page sequence="11">AUSTIN WARREN 575 dox?i.e., too inclusive?to forget that behind God the Son, Himself sturdy, is God the Father, the Creator of all things and the Abyss of Godhead, unexhausted by what His creatures under stand of His ways: moving in a mysterious way His wonders to perform, and best known not defining Him. Yet in allowing for God's ways not being our ways we mustn't use language equivocally but apply our humanly highest stan dards. Writing on Abraham, Isaac, and God (no. 1317), Emily doesn't hesitate to identify God with "tyranny" and to find the moral of the averted human sacrifice in the reflection that, even with a "Mastiff," "Manners may prevail." The existence of a God Emily never doubts. The "fop, the Carp, the Atheist" value the present moment, yet "their commuted feet/The Tor rents of Eternity/Do all but inundate." The problem of Belief is ever with her. The abdication of Belief Makes the Behavior small? Better an ignis fatuus Than no illume at all. "Belief, it does not fit so/When altered frequently." There must be a Heaven because there certainly are saints on earth; and sanctity argues its survival. But how prove a sky to a mole? uToo much of proof affronts Belief." The turtle won't try to demonstrate to us that he can move?but, when we have turned our backs, he does. "That oblique Belief which we call con jecture"?is the attempt to guess what Heaven is like?to pic ture "What eye hath not seen"?what the "mansions" of Heaven look like. Emily speculates on the state of the dead: whether they know what is happening to us or are too removed; or whether, on the contrary, they are nearer to us for the absence of their bodies. But these are conjectures unanswered by Scrip tures. Straight belief is uncircumstantial ; content to affirm what it cannot map or delineate. And, for Emily, belief is straight.</page><page sequence="12">576 EMILY DICKINSON IV I heartily wish that conjecture about Emily's lovers might cease as unprofitable. Of course her poems are all "fragments of a great confession": of course she wrote out of her life, her life on various levels. But books on who her "lover" was turn at tention from the poems to the poet, and substitute detective work for criticism. Her readers of the 1890's did not require to know what "who" or "whos" gave her insight into love and renunci ation, nor need we. It is when the best of philosophers make blunders not inherent in their systems but extraneous to it?when Berkeley, in his neo Platonic SiriSy advocates the panacea of tar water,?that we legitimately seek a biographical explanation. And when a good poet writes inferior poems we are concerned with the reason for the badness, in order to leave, inviolate, the goodness of the other poems. But the "goodness" is not so to be explained. One must distinguish biography from literary biography, dis tinguish between the study of the empirical person who wrote poems and that undeniable "personality" present in poems which makes them recognizable as written by the same person. What is biographically peculiar to the empirical person is not relevant to the "good poems,55 those intelligible to and valued by com petent readers, which are elucidatory of our own experiences. To be sure, literary criticism can scarcely avoid a psychology of types?as it cannot dispense with a knowledge of the culture in which a poet was reared,?and, certainly, cannot lack a close in timacy with the state of the language from which the poet makes artfully expressive deviations. But biographical studies and culture-history?for those who practice them, ends in themselves ?are to be used by a critic with caution and delicacy. Scholar ship as such restricts a great poet to her own time, place, and em pirical self. Criticism must delicately "clear55 the poems for present use and evaluation?show what is for our time, or, more grandiosely, what is for all times.</page><page sequence="13">AUSTIN WARREN 577 I make these commonplaces of neoclassical and contemporary criticism, conscious that, in what immediately follow, I may seem to diverge from them. There is a "lion in the way" of contemporary readers of Emily?the lion of biography. It has proved impossible not to pursue, to an extent, the facts gathered and the speculations offered by those who have sought to attach Emily's power as a poet of love and death to some single love and renunciation. A widely informed and sensible work is Mrs. Bingham's Emily Dickinsonys Home: Letters of Edward Dickinson and his Family, with Documentation and Comment (1955), which, as commen tary, combines social history with family biography: I would commend specifically the chapters, "The New England Way," "Recreation," "Funerals and Fears," "Dickinson 'Difference.' " The daughter of Mrs. Todd, Emily's first editor, takes in her stride the loves, real or imaginary; and she cites the testimony of Emily's brother, William Austin. A year his sister's senior, Austin was a collector of paintings and enamoured of shrubs, the honorable assumptor of his father's responsibilities to college, town, and family, yet a more flexible and troubled character. Austin, to whom, while he was away from Amherst, Emily wrote copious letters, who, in manhood, lived in the house next door in troubled marriage with "Sister Sue," who was the affectionate brother, seems to me the most competent judge of his sister's personality. What was his judgment of the "lovers"? Asked, after Emily's death, the direct question, "Did she fall in love with the Rev. Mr. Wadsworth?" he thought not. He said that "at different times" Emily "had been devoted to several men." He even went so far as to maintain that she had been several times in love, in her own way. But he denied that because of her devotion to any one man she forsook all others. Emily "reached out eagerly, fervently even, toward anybody who lighted the spark . . ." Wadsworth certainly mattered to Emily; and the time of his</page><page sequence="14">578 EMILY DICKINSON removal from Philadelphia to San Francisco, a distance prohibi tive of prompt access to him by letter, coincides with significant alterations in her life and poetry. Yet this was a fantasy of love, constructed about a man whom she scarcely knew and who was doubtless never aware of her idealization. Her sense for what is real always won out over whatever presented attractive fantasy. There were, I think, many loves in Emily5s life, loves of varying kinds and durations. There were infatuations with Sister Sue and Kate Anthon, perhaps with Helen Hunt Jackson? loves "natural55 enough and permitted by 19th century standards. There was a succession of males to whom she attached her de votion: some of them, like Gould, Humphrey, and Newton, and Colonel Higginson, her "teachers"; some more awesome charac ters. Her father, Edward Dickinson, was a kind of version of God the Father: stern and implacable, yet a tower and rock of strength; mysterious in his ways, but doubtless always acting for the best; the man of moral rigidity who was none the less capable of ringing the church bell as for a fire so that his neighbors emerge from their houses to share a magnificent sunset. Her feeling for her father was, I should guess, dominant. Her "poems about God,55 the "Papa in Heaven," are little girl com pounds of pertness and humility addressed to a powerful and puzzling big man, to Admirable Omnipotence. Her figures psychically distant and impressive?Father, the Rev. Mr. Wads worth, Mr. Bowles, the Editor of the Springfield Republican} were all "Fathers"; and God she made in their image and like ness. It seems archetypally true of Emily to say that God was her Lover. The God whom she reverenced was not the Son, the "Paragon of Chivalry," like her brother Austin and indeed her self, but God the Father, the Lover at once infinitely attractive and infinitely awesome, one partly revealed by the Son and His</page><page sequence="15">AUSTIN WARREN 579 nature, but only partly revealed; finally, the unattainable God. "He who loves God must not expect to be loved in return." All of Emily's lovers were unattainable: either members of her family or women or married men; and they were doubtless loved, in her way, precisely because they were unattainable,?did not, could not, expose, even to herself, the nature of her dedi cation. Emily's life is no riddle. New England had?and has? many maiden ladies like her, and many widows who are like maiden ladies. There are many who have loved unsuccessfully or insuitably?whom fear or pride have kept from the married state; many who have loved "above them," could love in no other way, and who prefer singleness to some democratic union. The father who prefers his daughters not to marry, who needs them at home with him, is matched by the daughter so filial as to prefer the tried arrangement. There is nothing monstrous?or even necessarily thwarted or blighted?about such women. They have their friends and their duties; they can nurture their own sensibilities and spiritualities?grow sharper in consciousness for their economy. Many gradually withdraw from the world as Emily did. The circumference shrinks as friends die or depart; the pattern of life becomes more rigid. But the withdrawal can be gain if there is something to withdraw to. Most spinsters have, like Emily, their brand of humor, their mode of ritual?perhaps even their habitual way of dressing; but what differentiates Emily is that she had her poetry. She need not avert or circumvent woe save by the strategem of poetry. She need not keep her grief to her self; she could give it to consciousness and to paper?could face it by naming it. Many richnesses sustained Emily?among them her sense of "degree," of status, of family. Of "degree" she was positively and negatively aware. When she wasn't a little girl, to be fed a crumb, she was a Queen or an Empress, jewelled and triumph 4</page><page sequence="16">580 EMILY DICKINSON ant on a throne. At once no man was "good enough" for her to marry, and those higher than she were so much higher as to seem out of reach or, in fantasy, grandly, by their election, to lift her to equality. She was a Dickinson, the daughter of a "Squire,55 whose father had been one of the founders of Amherst College, whose brother was, if epigone, the honorable successor to greatness. The bonds between her and her family were such as to sustain her pride. She was not, however she might seem to Boston, a rural poetess or spinster, but a princess. When Colonel Higginson proposed visits to Boston, access to her intellectual and literary "peers55 (Julia Ward Howe, for example, or Mrs. Sargent and her monthly convenings of paper-readers and polite disputants), Emily could not be moved from Amherst. She never came to Higginson: he, and other professed admirers, had to come to her, to her home, where she could set the tone and dictate the ritual. Emerson might leave Concord for the Saturday Club; like,Tho reau, Emily stayed at home. It has often been regretted that she did not, like Whitman, tender her poems to Emerson5s sympathetic inspection rather than to Higginson5s mixture of admiration and critical gentility; but Emerson, despite his elegant courtesy, his mode of listening to others, could not at once be heeded?and dismissed. Emerson was polished "granite55?a master, like Emily herself, and (un like her chosen mentors) a master in a domain too closely im pinging on her own. In reputation "above55 her, she was a poet in-verse such as he but adumbrated. He could not serve in the convenient capacity of Higginson nor incite the terror of for bidden presences. How perceptive, how shrewd to estimate those who would serve, was this New England spinster. She seized upon what she needed, but seizure sufficed: she had no taste for neighbors. V After the fashion of nineteenth century anthologies like</page><page sequence="17">AUSTIN WARREN 581 Bryant's Family Library of Poetry and Song and Emerson's Parnassusy Emily's poems were first published under the head ings, "Life," "Nature," "Love," and "Time and Eternity." But these categories are far from being mutually exclusive; in deed, they cannot be separated in any good poet or verse, and are not in Emily and Emily's,?for a poet thinks analogically, thinks in terms of the interaction and interp?n?tration of these or any other spheres of being. Nature, to Emily, is "Animated." She anthropomorphizes: bobolink, butterfly, rat, and the snake?no stranger to us, doubt less, than our fellows, whom, in turn, we metamorphose from the creatures. Inanimate Nature is also animate, like animal or person or ghostly presence. An awful Tempest mashed the air? The clouds were gaunt, and few A Black?as of a Spectre's Cloak Hid Heaven and Earth from view. Even the machine?the railroad train?is Animated Nature in the poem, one of a brilliant series in which, as in the Old Eng lish Riddle Poems, the object is characterized but never named, conceptualized. Her train is a mythological beast which first, catlike, laps the miles and licks the valleys up and which ends, horselike, by neighing and stopping} "docile and omnipotent/At its own stable door." What moves is living; but death is immobile, and so are its approximations?loss, departures, removals. Superficially, to be sure, Emily is in the line of those village versifiers whose function was to elegize the dead in broadside or for incision on slate or marble gravestones; and many of her poems were either composed, or later made to serve, as tributes to her deceased relatives, friends, Amherst acquaintances, the dis tant admired (Charlotte Bronte and George Eliot). Then, too, she was reared in a period in which poets like Poe, Bryant (who</page><page sequence="18">582 EMILY DICKINSON celebrated death from "Thanatopsis" till his own), anthologies like Cheever's Poets of Americay and newspaper poems, often cut out and preserved in scrapbooks, made the "topic" appear particularly suited to verse. The frequency with which mortuary accounts appeared in her newspaper, the Springfield Republican y prompted Emily to ask a friend in 1853: "Who writes those funny accidents, where railroads meet each other unexpectedly, and gentlemen in factories get their heads cut off quite infor mally?" It was Amherst custom, as it was elsewhere in New Eng land, to visit cemeteries on Sunday afternoons. The local grave yard adjoined the Dickinson orchard on Pleasant Street; and, during her youth, funeral processions passed by the Dickinson house. These circumstances supply a tradition and mollify, if not re move, suspicion of Emily's morbidity. But, if they elucidate, they do not explain Emily's death poems, which are unlike Poe's and unlike Bryant's. To the most cursory scanner, Emily was "much obsessed by Death." "Goings away," departures, whether to geographic dis tances or by felt disloyalties, spacial and psychic separations, absences from us, all disjunctions, can be felt, and were, by Emily, as deaths. In a rather usual pattern of reaction, she wrote her Death poems with a quality of magnitude almost proportioned to, for her, the unimportance of the intimated "person in mind,55 ?the occasion for a poem, not its motive or momentum. Emily5s "white election,55 we know, began around the year 1862. This "white election55: could it not have been Emily5s acceptance of Death, her suicide without suicide? What "facts55 are supposed to explain the "problem of Emily55 point to some one, a Person unacknowlegeable to her consciousness. Her poems suggest compelled flights from impending, threatening conscious ness of that person or persons. How angry we feel when one towards whom we had felt, or protested we did, dies on us. He or she has up and left us. As</page><page sequence="19">AUSTIN WARREN 583 hamed of anger towards the "loved dead"?or those loved who have separated from us, one denies the feeling. Emily's "white election" is not wholly devoid of moral blackmail, consequent guilts?rich pasture for poetry. The poems about death are ranging in kind and tone. One says that Emily's poems about death are sometimes written from the point of view of the observer; in others, she is witnessing her own death by anticipation ("You'll be sorry when I'm dead" or "I want to die"); in others she is contemplating present desti tution by loss ("My life closed twice before its close"). The poems don't have to be in the first person to be self-regarding. On such a night, or such a night, Would anybody care If such a little figure Slipped quiet from its chair? and "Twas the old?road?through pain" and the other poems about the death of a little girl seem, unavoidably, Emily in such postures, quite as much as "If I shouldn't be alive . . ." Of all the poems about death one is temerarious in distinguish ing the observed from the imagined or fictive. "Looking at Death, is Dying" (281) is a maxim to be attended?even though it occurs in a poem not about death but about loss. How can one write about death without having experienced it? For whom the bell tolls, it tolls for the onlooker and is his memento mori. The dead are variously conceived of,?sometimes as in their graves, quiet despite the bustle of the day and of history ("How many times these low feet staggered," "Safe in their alabaster chambers"). "I'm sorry for the dead today," light in tone, lightly pities the sleeping farmers and their wives who "rest" while the festival of haying goes on in the village about them. In another poem, the grave is a cottage where a girl plays at "Keeping house" and prepares "marble tea." And the grave stone is a kind of death-mask for the dead beneath it: it tries to</page><page sequence="20">584 EMILY DICKINSON thank those who gave the robin a "memorial crumb," and tries with "granite lip." Perhaps the most brilliant of the death-in-death poems is "A clock stopped?/Not the Mantel's," a masterpiece in the em ployment of a conceit coterminous with the poem?a definition once proposed for Donne's poem but more accurately applied to such of Emily's as this. Most of what is said fits approximately both sides of the equation; and that intellectual work which is the conceit serves, as we know, to distance the poem. Like a train, a clock may be felt near to animate. In fable, a clock stops when its owner dies; at any event, it measures the clock-time by which men live. The Doctor is a "Shopman," a clock-repairer; but he cannot set the heart's pendulum to swing ing again. To the dead, hours, and minutes and "Seconds," are alike now meaningless. They are meaningless compared with the "Decades"?more than the meter can justify this understatement for "centuries"?the "decades of Arrogance" which separate "Dial life" from the "Degreeless Noon" of Eternity. The "Trinket," the diminutively precious object, has gained the ac crual of "awe"; and the onlooker feels the "arrogance" of the dead? their unconcern for us. This poem appears to take the stance of the onlooker; but does it? It can well be argued that the poet imagines herself at the lofty distance of death, evisages how those others will feel as they watch and witness. In a poem like this the distinction be tween the imagined and the imaginer becomes impossible to fix. In Emily's poems, the referent and its metaphoric referend are often difficult to distinguish. "There's a certain slant of light" is a poem ostensibly about winter afternoons with their "Heavenly Hurt" and their "Seal Despair"; when that winter light goes, "tis like the Distance/ On the look of Death." In this poem "Death" is a metaphor for winter light and at the same time winter light is a metaphor for death: one inclines to say, preponderantly the latter. "I like</page><page sequence="21">AUSTIN WARREN 585 a look of Agony/Because I know it's true" invokes the glazing of the eyes in death; but "Beads upon the Forehead" are invoked by "Anguish"; and the death is not the death of the dead but of the living. "A wounded Deer?leaps highest" in the "Extasy of death" ; yet the next metaphors, the "smitten rock" and the "trampled steel" are not death but, by anthropomorphic transfer, versions of that present anguish of which mirth is the cautious "Mail." "It can't be Dying! It's too Rouge?/The Dead shall go in White" (no. 221) is a poem ostensibly about a sunset, a tra ditional symbol for death; but, by the familiar figure of suggest ing by denying, she has occasion to speak of a kind of death. The reference to white suggests Emily's own habitual garb from this time on. In the Orient, as she may have known, white is the color of lovers who have come through great tribulation and washed their robes (cf. no. 325; Revelation 7:14) and as the color of her "blameless mystery"?-perhaps in contrast to the blame-suspect black veil of Hawthorne's clergyman. White is the color for her kind of death-in-life; and the poem seems dynamized by it, with the sunset metaphor. Suggestion by negation is most powerfully used in "It was not Death, for I stood up," a poem about death-in-life. The state deanimizes the self. The Figures I have seen Set orderly, for Burial Reminded me, of mine? As if my life were shaven, And fitted to a frame, And could not breathe without a key . . . It felt like the stopping of a clock, like frost-frozen ground (deanimizing images) ; but most like chaos?chaos without "even a Report of Land/To justify?Despair." These poems about despair are probably the best poems Emily</page><page sequence="22">586 EMILY DICKINSON ever wrote; but they cannot be taken as her total "message to the world." Reading her work does not induce despair. For her self first, and then for her readers, the very articulation of des pair is effectual movement towards its dispelling. The autonomy of Nature and the "creatures55 constantly arouses her fascinated apprehension of the variety and flexibility of nature. If anger and fear paralyze, "self-reliance55 has its resources unessayed without the felt need: If your Nerve, deny you? Go above your Nerve? He can lean against the Grave, If he fear to swerve? 5Tis so appalling?it exhilarates? So over Horror, it half Captivates? The Soul stares after it, secure? To know the worst, leaves no dread more? Then there are Emily5s poems about immortality, which she both doubted and affirmed?affirmed not only on Bible testi mony but from the argument that as there are saints there must be a Heaven?as there is grandeur, it cannot finally perish. These poems are variously mythic: there is no Biblical warrant for "fleshless lovers55 meeting in Heaven. Whatever Emily5s personal belief?centrally, a belief in belief?her after-death poems are readily translatable into other terms. As God is the resource, within or without, which transcends the resources we thought were our limits, so eternity is a name for ultimate defi nitions of the total personality: Of all the Souls that stand create? I have elected?One? When Sense from Spirit?files away? And Subterfuge?is done? The final sense of Emily5s total achievement is the power of poetry to register and master experience.</page></plain_text>
