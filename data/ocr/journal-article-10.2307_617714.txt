It is not satisfactory simply to characterize Judaism as an anti-iconic religion and construct reasons for this, when practice has so constantly belied such a theory. (Even in the Bible which forbids anthropomorphism or theriomorphism, the prohibition evidently never affected verbal images.) These opening paragraphs show an imperfect understanding of the basic 'sacra- mental' world view not only of Christianity but also, in a way, of its cultural sister, Judaism. But the rest of the introduction is more helpful, and brings out, on Levi- Straussian lines, such common patterns of theme and interpretation as the volume presents. Unfortunately, the opening essay, ' Das Bild des Unsichtbaren. Zu den friihen Christus- bildern ', by M. Barasch, is the least satisfac- tory item in the volume, and it may also have influenced the introduction in the respect just criticized. A disappointing text is matched by poor use of illustrations (including a simple mistake regarding a famous mosaic) and an antiquated bibliography, which fails to reflect how this subject has been revolutionized in the past 30 years. In the other essay on Christian themes, I. P. and C. Culianu study the Ascent of Elijah and the Dormition of Mary in Rumanian folk icons and interestingly suggest that pre- Christian religion has left traces. Certainly, such influences are not infrequent in popular Orthodox and Catholic religion; but the philo- logical arguments need a more up-to-date treatment. As for the legend of the Jew whose hands were cut off and restored, whatever the reasons why this came to be a favourite detail in Balkan icons, it ought to be said clearly that it is explicit in the Greek literary tradition from John of Thessalonica in the early sixth century. The only article on a Jewish theme, by J. Gutmann, on the Judaeo-German custom of embroidering and treasuring cloths used at circumcision, is interesting, but strange as a contribution to a volume on representations of gods. Two articles deal with ancient Near Eastern religion: H. Sauren discusses the dress of gods in Mesopotamian literary and visual docu- ments, identifying the symbolic regalia related especially to planetary deities, while W. Neumer-Pfau discusses the warrior-goddesses who take part in the Gigantomachy on the great frieze of the Pergamon Altar, relating them to the Anatolian cult of the Great Mother. The articles mentioned with special prai , at the beginning are also those which range farthest beyond the Near Eastern and Euro- pean fields. R. M. Berndt is the leading authority on Australian Aboriginal religion, and his article gives a most informative intro- duction to its subject. A. M. Hocquenghem, likewise an authority on the Mochicas of Peru, examines two important iconographic features, the fangs bared by supernatural beings and the serpents, usually attached to their girdles: these symbolize respectively the absolute authority and the immortality of the ancestors, forced labourers; and he left Madagascar under something of a cloud. There is insufficient space to do more than hint at the wide range of new information and valuable insights provided by Stephen Ellis in this study. His style is, unusually for an aca- demic treatise, clear and readable, aspiring at times to elegance. The book has been well pro- duced, with an excellent bibliography and no detectable misprints other than some for- givable misspellings of long and difficult Malagasy names; though some photographs and a few more maps would have been wel- come. Criticisms of the text are few and minor and relate mainly to the introductory chapter where there are occasional doubtful interpreta- tions and areas of vagueness in the treatment of the early history of the Merina people. The only important regret is that the book is directed at specialists on Madagascar, and a detailed knowledge of the historical, geo- graphical, and ethnic background is assumed. In the absence of a more comprehensive intro- ductory chapter and a wider use of explanatory footnotes, the non-expert will have to struggle with an unfamiliar political, social, and cul- tural background made more forbidding by the discouragingly long names of people and places. This is a pity as the book deserves a wide audience and can be read with much profit by students of general colonial history and Third World nationalism. In his introduc- tion, the author expresses the hope that in telling the story of the menalamba he will con- tribute to a wider understanding of Malagasy history. He has amply succeeded in this aim.

The plan of this Annual was briefly described in the review of Vol. I (BSOAS, XLVII, 3, 1984, 608). The papers in Vol. II are again related to a broad theme, but again loosely and with no claim to cover its main aspects. The eight studies gathered here are, however, mainly of a high standard and are well supported by 98 illustrations occupying 60 pages. Three of the contributions, which account for more than half of the volume between them, are abso- lutely authoritative, by masters of their sub- jects: R. M. Berndt on 'Images of God in Aboriginal Australia ', A. M. Hocquenghem on characteristic features of divine beings among the Mochicas of Peru, and H. von Stietencron on the development of myth and iconography in relation to Durga Mahisasuramardini. Since there is not a little to criticize in this volume, let this high praise stand first: it will be expanded below. The introduction, by L. P. van den Bosch, aims to sketch the theme of ' Representations of gods' and indicate how the various essays relate to it. He starts with assertions about attitudes to iconography in Judaism, Chris- tianity and Islam which the reviewer finds highly questionable-partly because of the 243 REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
