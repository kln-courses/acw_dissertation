<plain_text><page sequence="1">HAGERSTROM'S PHILOSOPHY OF LAW JOHN PASSMORE IN what it will be convenient to call "the Scandinavian school" of jurisprudence, Higerstrom is clearly the master. But his leadership is of a somewhat special kind. For all that he wrote a large book on Roman law,' Higerstrom was trained as, and continued to be, a philosopher, not a jurisprudentialist or a sociologist. His essays on law and morals are ancillary to his main purpose: to destroy trans- cendental metaphysics. The epigraphhe chose to head his contribution to Die Philosopihie der Gegenwart in Selbstdarstellungenz was uncom- promising: "Praeterea censeo metaphysicam esse delendam." If, in his published work, he to so considerable a degree concentrated his attention on ethics and jurisprudence, that is because he took them to be a particularly rich source of metaphysical mystery- mongering. Through a study of men's moral and legal ideas, Higerstr6m thought he could bring out the sources, the defects- and even, in a way, the strength-of metaphysical thinking.3 Except for his incursion into Roman law, Higerstr6m has little to say about detailed questions of legal theory.4 But his attack on metaphysics won him many converts, three of whom were to occupy Chairs of Law (Hdgerstrom's own Chair was in Philosophy): in Sweden, Lundstedt and Olivecrona, in Denmark Ross. What is often a mere sketch in Higerstrom is in their writings filled out; to see the full force of his legal philosophy one must turn to A. C. Lundstedt's Legal Thinking Revised (i956), K. Olivecrona's Law as Fact (I939), Alf Ross's Towards a Realistic Jurisprudence (I946).5 Yet the reverse also holds. No one of these latter books is wholly self-contained. To understand them, or effectively to criticize them, one must I Der r5mische Obligationsbegriff im Lichte der allgemeinen riimischen Rechtsanschauung (Vol. I, I927; Vol. II, I94I). 2 Vol. 7, I929, pp. III-59. 3 He applied his general ideas to physical science, however, in his Das Prinzip der Wissenschaft (I908). 4 The essay which relates most closely to a specific point in law is his The Conception of a Declaration of Intention in the Sphere of Private Law, which was first published, in Swedish, in I935, and is reprinted as the fifth essay in Hagerstrdm's Inquiries into the Nature of Laws and Morals (ed. K. Olivecrona, trans. C. D. Broad, I953). Unless the contrary is indicated, my page references to Hagerstrdm are to this volume. 5 Mentioned in this particular order, because Olivecrona was actually a pupil of Lundstedt's. Ross, however, refers in his book only to Hagerstr6m, not to Lundstedt or Olivecrona. I have made little use of Lundstedt's book, partly because it is written in a variety of English so peculiar as to be almost entirely unintelligible. I43</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY constantly return to Higerstr6m; they presume the substantial truth of his subtle and detailed philosophical analyses.i For this reason, the doctrine of the Scandinavian school has rather to be constructed than found; if the present essay is mainly devoted to Higerstrom, it at the same time, and inevitably, interprets Hdgerstr6m through the writing of his disciples-in spite of the obvious dangers in that method of interpretation. Like most Continental philosophers of his generation-he was born in i863 and died in I939-Hagerstr6m began from Kant; his study of Kant led him away from his first love, theology, and into philosophy. He soon developed Kant's theories in an anti-metaphysical direc- tion.2 In particular, he abandoned Kant's distinction between the empirical self-the self of everyday life and of psychology-and that "transcendental" self the existence of which, according to Kant, is presupposed in our moral thinking. Kant was right, Higerstr6m continued to believe, in maintaining that moral rules present them- selves to us as absolute, or categorical, imperatives, which we feel we must obey; his mistake lay in his supposing that any metaphysical consequences flow from this fact. Kant was driven into his "metaphysics of morals" because he saw the inconsistencies in everyday moral thinking, according to which moral rules and moral action belong to the ordinary empirical world, and yet have a queer sort of supernatural or transcen- dental status. If moral rules are to function as absolute imperatives, not just as convenient principles of conduct, then, Kant maintains, they must issue from a transcendental, self-governing self; and moral action if, as is commonly supposed, it is wholly free must proceed from that same self. For every action of the everyday, empirical, self is empirically conditioned. Thus neither moral rules nor moral action can be merely natural facts. I Thus Jerome Hall's recent criticism of the Scandinavian school in his "Reason and Reality in Jurisprudence" (Buffalo Law Review, Vol. 7, No. 3, I958, pp. 372-80) misses its target, just because he has failed to refer back beyond Ross, his principal source, to Hdgerstr6m. Thus, when criticizing Ross, Hall writes that "if disinterested attitudes are wholly factual, there still remains the problem of getting from that existential datum to the realm or 'illusion' of validity" (p. 376), Ross would certainly reply that this problem had already been solved by Hagerstr6m. 2 So far he belonged to the general neo-Kantian movement of his times. He does not explicitly refer to such fellow neo-Kantians as Lange, but he must have felt their influence-and, either independently or through their writings, the influence of British empiricism. The fact remains that the ambit of his thinking is German; British readers may sometimes wonder what the fuss is about because, with their utilitarian tradition, they have rarely taken seriously the distinction between the "normative" and the "factual"-the realm of values and the realm of facts-which runs through so much German ethical and legal philosophy. 144</page><page sequence="3">HAGERSTROM'S PHILOSOPHY OF LAW The dualism Kant perceived in uncritical moral thinking is paralleled, H5,gerstr6m thought, by a dualism within our concep- tions of the law. "Law", writes Ross, "is conceived at the same time as an observable phenomenon in the world of facts, and as a binding norm in the world of morals and rules, at the same time as physical and metaphysical, as empirical and a priori, as real and ideal, as something that exists and something that is valid" (p. ii). Con- fronted with this dualism, and conscious of the inconsistencies it involves, we may be tempted, like Kant, to construct a meta- physical theory as a way of overcoming these inconsistencies. This step was taken by Kelsen, whose Allgemeine Staatslehre (I925), Higerstrom reviewed at length.i In his efforts to achieve consistency Kelsen so metaphysicalizes law that he is quite unable to connect it-except by an arbitrary fiat-with everyday legislative and judicial procedures. The world of legal norms, according to Kelsen, is something quite other than the ordinary world of causal relationships: law knows nothing of what actually produces what, but only of what ought to produce what. But how can we possibly give an account of such a phenomenon as punishment, Hagerstr6m asks, except in terms of our experience of causal relationships? More generally, does not causality enter into all our conceptions of legal transactions? Of legislation, Kelsen wrote: "That which takes place in the act of legislation is the great mystery of law and of the state, and there- fore it is excusable that its essence can be displayed only in inade- quate images."2 Legislation, Kelsen admits, is part of the natural order, and yet it is at the same time the only medium through which the order of norms can reveal itself; the "mystery" lies in its being able to belong to both worlds at once. "One is inevitably reminded", comments Hdgerstrom, "of a mediaeval thinker who discusses the great mystery of the God-man!" (p. 268). When we look clearly at actual legislative processes we see no "mystery", but something quite prosaic, wholly natural: to turn these prosaic processes into a "great mystery" is to pervert the facts in the interest of meta- physical presumptions. "The law", Olivecrona sums up in his criticism of Kelsen, "is a link in the chain of cause and effect. It has therefore a place among the facts of time and space. But then it cannot at the same time belong to another world. The law cannot on the one hand be a fact (which it undoubtedly is) and on the other hand, something outside the chain of cause and effects" (p. I7). ' This review is translated as essay IV (pp. 257-298) in Inquiries. With much of Kelsen's work-and in particular his criticisms of Austin-Hdgerstr6m is in very great sympathy. He parts company with him, however, as soon as Kelsen embarks upon metaphysics. a Hauptprobleme der Staatsrechtslehre (I9 II), p. 105, as translated by Broad in H~gerstrom's Inquiries, p. 268. K I45</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY Dissatisfied, for this sort of reason, with attempts to overthrow the dualism of traditional legal theory by insisting upon the meta- physical nature of law, one may be tempted to turn in the opposite direction: concluding that to talk of "the absolute validity", or "the bindingness", or "the normative character", of law is just an obscure way of referring to certain social facts which can be specified in detail. Roughly speaking, this is the path taken by the American realists. But, Higerstrom objects, there are no social facts the existence of which is strictly equivalent to the "bindingness" of the law. Such facts as "I shall be punished, if I do not do this", "so-and- so commands me to do this", "the judges have decided that people caught acting in this way will be punished" are not, severally or collectively, equivalent to asserting that the law in question has a binding force, or is "valid". Ross puts the point thus: "The aim of a realistic criticism cannot merely be to spirit away the notions of validity. Such a method, which at present has champions in American 'realistic' jurisprudence, does not lead to the goal. It is true that it avoids dualism, but it does not conquer it. It is incapable of delimit- ing the legal phenomenon from other social behaviour" (p. I3). To say that "all we really mean" by asserting that the law is binding on us is that, for example, we run the risk of being punished if we disobey it does not do justice to the way the concept of "bindingness" actually functions in our thinking. So we seem to be in a dilemma. Everyday conceptions of law are wholly inconsistent; they cannot stand up to the criticisms of, on the one side, Kelsen, or, on the other side, the realists. Yet as soon as we try, in search of greater consistency, to identify law either with metaphysical norms or with a set of social facts, everything seems to go wrong: we are at once aware that we have left something out, something which ordinary legal doctrines, however confusedly, had recognized-that law is both a social fact and yet is, in some special sense, taken to be absolutely "binding". The problem, then, is to work out a philosophy of law which avoids inconsistency but does not falsify the facts. "The way out", to quote Ross again, "is not to evade dualism by choosing one of its components but to conquer dualism by showing that, rightly interpreted, it is not an expression of opposite and irreconcilable points of view, but symbolizes different, actual, elements of the legal phenomenon" (p. I3). This way out, it might be replied, had already been taken-by Austin and his followers. For if law is the command of a sovereign whose will we habitually obey, then, first, the existence of a law is a natural, non-metaphysical fact-the law p exists if and only if a sovereign has commanded p -and, secondly, one can understand why laws are felt to be absolutely binding: they are commanded by I46</page><page sequence="5">HAGERSTROM'S PHILOSOPHY OF LAW somebody to whom we habitually offer obedience, somebody we obey, that is, without any calculation of consequences. It is not surprising, then, that Hdgerstrom writes as if legal positivism were the only plausible alternative to his own philosophy of law; he devotes to a criticism of it most of the essays collected in his Inquiries into the Nature of Law and Morals. His argument takes the form of a dilemma. Literally interpreted, he tries to show, legal positivism is wholly implausible; interpreted in any other way, it collapses into metaphysics. Suppose, to take the most general form of the positivist theory, law is defined as "the will of the state". What, then, is "the will of the state"? To this question, Higerstr6m argues, there are three possible answers, none of them at all satisfactory: (i) The "will of the state" is nothing more than the rules of law which hold good in the state. "When it is said that the law contains the will of the state", Kelsen wrote in his Hauptprobleme der Staatsrechtslehre, "this merely means that the law determines the actual circumstances that are to be deemed the actions of the state, those which the state wills" (p. i83). But then it is merely tautologous to say that "rules of law are the will of the state"; this amounts to the quite empty assertion that "rules of law are the rules laid down as law". If this is all that is meant, one should abandon misleading talk about "the will of the state" and consider, simply, the way legal rules function within the state mechanism. (2) To avoid this emptiness, "the will of the state" may be identified with "the general will". Suppose we now try to interpret this expression "the general will" concretely, positively. Then it can only mean, Hagerstrom argues, "what everybody wills". But it is not true of any law that everybody wants it; the citizens of a state, indeed, ordinarily know nothing of most of the laws to which they are subject-and they can scarcely be held to "will" laws of which they are wholly ignorant. So, Hagerstrom concludes, the "general will" cannot be concretely interpreted; it has to be regarded as a queer sort of metaphysical entity, which in behaviour and charac- teristics bears no resemblance to what we ordinarily describe as "willing" and which is related to ordinary legislative processes in a quite unintelligible way. (3) In the hope of being at once informative and non-metaphysical, the positivist may contend that "the will of the state" is an elliptical way of referring to the commands of certain quite specific persons. Those persons are variously identified: sometimes as the sovereign ruler, sometimes as the legislator, sometimes as the judge. Seeking an answer to the question: "Who commands the law?", positivists have fixed the responsibility now at this point, now at that point, in the legal mechanism. But each resting-point, Higerstrom argues, I47</page><page sequence="6">P H I L O S O P H Y has the same defect: the alleged "commander" is himself bound by legal rules; and indeed his ability to affect the course of the law depends precisely on that fact. So law cannot be defined as "what the commander commands". Some persons, Higerstr6m willingly admits, are favourably placed in that "network of positions of power" which constitutes the state. As members of the Cabinet, for example, they may help to determine the sort of proposal which is put before the legislature, and thus, in the long run, they may influence the conduct of judges, policemen, and citizens. The fact remains that the law is by no means identical with what such persons will to be the case; indeed, the very effectiveness of their action depends upon the existence of laws which they did nothing to create-laws which guarantee to them, under specific conditions, the exercise of a certain kind of power. The most that could properly be meant by the assertion that "the law is the will of the state", Hdgerstr6m concludes, is that laws are brought forward and supported by the very same forces which sustain the state. But even then, he thinks, the language of "wills" is objectionable, for it suggests that the heterogeneous forces which sustain the state are each of them a form of will, and this is simply not the case. "Suppose we inquire", Higerstr6m writes, "as to the force which commonly keeps in existence an already existing law. The answer is a medley of all kinds of heterogeneous factors. They include the popular feeling of justice, class-interests, the general inclination to adapt oneself to circumstances, fear of anarchy, lack of organization among the discontented part of the people, and by no means least the inherited custom of observing what is called the law of the land" (p. 39). To construct a "voluntary will" out of such a conglomeration of forces, he concludes, is to indulge in an egregious version of anthropomorphic metaphysics. Similar considerations apply, Higerstr6m suggests, to those other circumstances in which it is customary to invoke the phrase "the will of the state". Suppose we are asked why the judge in a particular case applies customary law or "the spirit of the law" praeter or contra legem. We might reply that in such cases the judge expresses "the real will of the state". But what evidence can there be that this is so-that the judge's decision rather than the relevant legisla- tion expresses "the real will"? In fact, once more, all sorts of con- siderations influence the judge's decision: his notions of justice, his fear of popular disapproval, his interest in bringing about, or pre- venting, certain kinds of social change-perhaps, even, his conviction, however ill-founded, that it is his task to express the real will of the state. To amalgamate this set of influences into a single mythical entity-"the real will"-is at once to be landed in metaphysics; I48</page><page sequence="7">HAGERSTROM'S PHILOSOPHY OF LAW instead of undertaking a genuine, positive, inquiry into the forces which influence the conduct of judges the "real will" theorist stops inquiry with an empty gesture. An even more fundamental objection to legal positivism, Higer- str6m argues, is that it is a serious error, even if a very natural one, to assimilate laws to commands. To make this point, Hagerstrom embarks upon a complex and a detailed investigation into the related notions of a command, an admonition, a threat, a duty, a right. A "command" he defines as an attempt, commonly making use of words, on the part of one person (the commander) to cause another person (the commanded) to act or not to act in a particular way, without offering him any inducement to do so or, more generally, without putting before him any reason for so acting. If inducements are offered, this is a promise or a threat, not a command; if attention is drawn to the value of the act in question, this is advice or admoni- tion. "Shut the door" is a command; "shut the door or I will tell your mother" is a threat; "you will find that if you shut the door, it will be easier for you to work" is a piece of advice; "you ought to develop the habit of shutting the door" is an admonition. A command, he argues, is not equivalent to a judgment, e.g. to a statement of volition. "I want you to go" invites the question "But why?", whereas a command is an attempt to damp down questions or objections. It seeks to create an immediate association "between a feeling of conative impulse and the idea of a certain action" (p. i20) -without any pause for reflection, or hesitation, or doubt. It works successfully only when there exists a special relationship between commander and commanded in the form of a feeling of inferiority, however engendered, which creates in the person commanded a susceptibility to the commands issuing from the being he accepts as his superior. That the sense of duty is somehow related to the feeling of being commanded is strongly suggested, according to Hagerstrom, by the history of ethical theory: ethical theorists have repeatedly argued that doing one's duty consists in obeying commands-whether the commands of God, or of the sovereign, or of conscience, or of one's own will. We experience an inner necessitation, Higerstr6m agrees with Kant, which drives us to perform our duty; and this is by no means identical with the feeling which arises when we act in a certain way in order to avoid unpleasant consequences, or because we believe it is the way of acting which is most likely to conserve, or produce, or exemplify, what we value. We feel impelled to do our duty, irrespective of our independent valuation of the act in question. To this extent, Hagerstrom admits, there is a great resemblance between the state of consciousness experienced by the recipient of a I49</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHY command and the state of consciousness experienced by a person who is influenced by a sense of duty: each experiences a direct conative impulse to act in a particular way.' At the same time, Hagerstrom considers, there is an important difference between the two cases. A pure command-"Shut the door!"-cannot possibly be expressed as a judgment. On the other hand, this is the natural mode in which to formulate a conviction of duty: we say "This action is my duty", or "I am under an obligation to act in this way", where, on the face of it, we are ascribing to the action in question certain objective properties, the property of "being our duty" or "being obligatory". Yet if we go in search of such a property, Higerstr6m argues, we cannot find it; indeed, to assert of something that it "ought-to-be" cannot be identical with asserting that it in fact possesses such-and-such properties. Hagerstrom's conclusion is that the indicative statement: "This action is my duty" is a reflex expression of the conative impulse to perform the action in question; so far, it is comparable with an interjection. The statement does not of course assert that I am experiencing such-and-such an impulse; it merely expresses this impulse. The impulse expresses itself as an ingredient in a judgment, Hagerstrom suggests, because the cognitive side-the contemplation of the act in question-is so prominent in our consciousness that our impulse seeks to be represented within it. (Compare "What a cheerful scene!"., "That book is interesting", "How disgusting to eat snails!", etc.) Since our impulses to act are not merely personal to us-they are common to members of the same social and linguistic group- the expressions to which they give rise come to have all the formal characteristics of genuinely descriptive expressions. I can ask myself, for example, what is implied by the fact that it is my duty to nomin- ate examiners. Thus we can easily believe that such expressions refer to actual properties of acts. The crucial point, for Hdgerstrom, is that when we take an act to be our duty we believe that it is objectively our duty, quite irrespec- tive of the fact that someone has commanded it. No doubt, we may consider it our duty to obey a particular commander; but this, we believe, is not because we are commanded to obey him but because it is objectively our duty to do so. If we inquire into the origins of this belief, to the way in which our inner necessitation arises, we shall certainly find, Hdgerstrom thinks, that in our early years we were commanded by parents, friends, teachers-their commands to a large degree converging-to act in the way we now take to be obligatory; we shall find, too, that we first met with certain of these courses of action as the customs of our community, which we took 1 Compare C. D. Broad: "Hagerstr6m's Account of Sense of Duty and Certain Allied Experiences" (Philosophy, Vol. XVI, No. 97, pp. 99-II3). I50</page><page sequence="9">HAGERSTROM'S PHILOSOPHY OF LAW over in the course of our education. But we do not regard an act as "our duty" until we have shaken it loose from any reference to particular commanders, or to particular customs: until we believe, that is, that the situation which confronts us objectively "calls for" certain action on our part, whatever other people may think about it. We come to regard an action, in other words, as being commanded by its very nature, as distinct from being commanded by so-and-so. And with a belief that the action is quite objectively demanded of us is associated the belief that this demand applies to everybody in our position; so that we feel moral indignation when other people fail to react appropriately. We develop a "sense of justice", which demands reparation when men fail to perform "their duty"-even when their failure has no direct effect on our interests. This transmutation of commands, and of customs, into what Olivecrona calls "independent imperatives" is of immense social importance. So long as a system of government is thought of as working solely with commands, its subjects are always liable to feel that these commands may turn out to be merely whims. But if the law is thought of as objectively binding then the situation changes: the compulsion associated with it is now a righteous compulsion, and the law operates as effectively in the absence of its administrators as in their presence. It is true that the development of such a "moral sense" on the part of their subjects may in some respects limit the activities of the governing groups. They can no longer act in a quite arbitrary way, unless they are prepared to run the risk of stirring up powerful moral feelings. In general terms, all the same, the existence of these feelings helps to make more secure the position of the state. And if a certain consciousness persists that "objective norms" have some resemblance to commands, this can be met by describing them as flowing from "the will of God" or from "the real will of the state". Let us now consider the implications of this general theory of duty for the philosophy of law. In the first place, a law is not a command: a command is addressed by a particular person to a particular person, and laws fulfil neither of these conditions. If a policeman says to me: "Keep off the grass", this is a command; if he utters these words when nobody is present he is not com- manding-although he may be practising how to command. In contrast, a notice reading "Keep off the grass" does not cease to have legal force merely because nobody reads it; nor is its force affected by the fact that no clear answer can be given to the question "Who says so?" Even if the notice adds: "By order: the Town Clerk", it would be absurd to say that the Town Clerk commands us to keep off the grass. Most likely, he does not even know that the notice exists; and if there were for the time being no Town Clerk, the notice would still be legally effective. I5I</page><page sequence="10">P H I L O S O P H Y Equally, laws are not statements. Nobody could insist more strongly than Higerstrom that laws are imperative in their intention. They do not tell us that we must do this or that, but they do tell us what line of conduct we are to adopt if certain circumstances arise: they tell judges how they are to behave in the event that a murderer is found guilty in a court over which they are presiding, they tell policemen how to proceed if they suspect somebody of having committed a burglary, they tell any of us that if we buy a car we are to register it, that if we wish to enter into a contract which will be enforceable at law we must go through such-and-such procedures, that if we wish to leave money to a university such-and-such forms are to be observed. We can express these facts generally, as Olive- crona does, by saying that laws put before us "patterns of conduct". But, of course, any preacher or poet might put before us patterns of conduct. What constitutes the peculiar effectiveness of the patterns promulgated in laws, we might ask, if not that we are commanded to adhere to them? Their effectiveness, Higerstrom would reply, derives from the fact that they have a certain kind of backing; they are supported by force-by executive action. An act is illegal if, and only if, it is liable to punishment; a contract is legally binding if, and only if, the penalties attached to it would be enforced by the court.' Popular thinking reverses the true order of dependence in speaking as if an act is liable to punishment because it is illegal: in fact, the illegality of an act simply consists in its liability to punishment. Illegality, so Higerstrom sums up, is "the behaviour, whether it be omission or positive action, which calls forth a certain reaction in accordance with the rules for coercion which are in general applied and irresistibly carried out as a matter of fact in a human community" (p. 348). The capacity of the law to coerce is not sustained by, just as it does not express, a will or set of wills. It presupposes, in the first place, what Hdgerstrom calls "social instinct"-the fact that "in a certain community the members are inclined, in general independently of all reflection, to follow certain rules of action, whereby co-operation at least for maintenance of life and propagation within the group becomes possible" (p. 350). In particular, the effectiveness of a legal system presupposes that this instinct should be attached to rules of law. Then the man who contemplates illegal action is checked by I Confusion may be caused by the use of the phrase "legally binding" in relation to contracts. To say they are legally binding is different from saying that the law to which they conform is binding upon us. We could, in principle, admit that the contract is a binding one, i.e. is good in law, and yet reject the claims of the law to bind us. The question "does this conform to law?" is a different question from "shall I obey the law?" The second sort of "legal bindingness" is the sort which cannot be reduced to susceptibility to penalty; the first sort can be. 152</page><page sequence="11">HAGERSTROM'S PHILOSOPHY OF LAW his awareness of the effect that the illegality of his action will have in arousing the moral disapproval of others; he is checked, too, by his own internal reaction to the performance of illegal actions. But as well, he knows that his fellow-citizens will regard themselves as possessing certain "rights" which may induce them to set in opera- tion the legal machinery against him. Thus to the influence of his own moral feelings and the moral pressure of the community is added a fear of punishment. Another important factor, particularly at certain stages in the development of legal systems, lies in the association of legal power with supposed supernatural forces. Higerstrom's studies in Roman Law were directed towards revealing the magical elements which are concealed within that Law.' These magical elements persist, he believes, within modern systems of law, but he has less to say about their operation there. One can see clearly enough, however, the magical significance of oath-taking, of donning a black cap, of the archaic and arcane formulae in which legal rules are commonly expressed-to say nothing of the bringing of laws into association with a sovereign ruler who has himself been subjected to the magical ceremony of coronation. These various social, moral, religious forces-not a will, or collection of wills-sustain the legal system. "The legal order", he contends, "whose very existence as a power simply reduces to the fact that certain coercive rules are actually maintained through the positive attitude of the subjects towards them, cannot be a power which stands above its subjects and imperiously issues commands to them" (p. 360). The doctrine of a sovereign will persists, Hagerstrom suggests, because it is felt to be an essential ingredient in the conceptions of guilt and "just punishment". When it can no longer plausibly be maintained that laws express the commands of Jehovah and that men are punished because they violate His commands, these modes of expression are transferred to "the legal order", which is then endowed with quasi-personal characteristics.' Punishment, on this view, is extended to those who are guilty of "offending against the I Of course, it was no news that law, even Roman Law, had grown out of ritualistic practices, but Hagerstr6m thought that these practices exercised an influence at a much later date than was commonly supposed, that they were powerful ingredients within conceptions like ius and dominium. His conception of magic derived from Fraser. By "magic" he means a belief in the power to influence the course of events by means other than natural causality, and especially by the use of special forms of utterance and ritual. Of course Hagerstrdm does not believe that there really are such powers; he is concerned, only, with the belief that there are. 2 The transition, we might say, is from the "And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying" of Leviticus via "Be it enacted by the Queen's most excellent Majesty" to doctrines that "the people" or "the State" command the laws. I53</page><page sequence="12">PHILOSOPHY will of the state". To reject the "will" theory, or to deny that there are objective "rights" and "duties", is felt, therefore, to undermine the entire system of punishment. But fortunately, Hagerstr6m believes, the operations of the legal system can be justified on purely natural as well as on superstitious grounds. "Unjust" punishment, for example, threatens the very nature of law as a method of co-operation. "It is therefore natural", Higerstr6m writes, "that an individual who suffers punishment not enjoined by the penal law should become an object of sympathy, for he is a victim of an act which is itself socially detrimental accord- ing to the general social estimation. The feeling of revolt in such cases will therefore always survive, even if feelings originally pro- duced by superstition should lose their power over men's minds" (p. 366). This doctrine is more fully developed by Lundstedt who, unlike Hdgerstrom, had explicit political objectives-he was an intellectual leader in the Swedish Labour Party. His position can be put thus: historically, law has been largely based upon superstitions, upon metaphysical conceptions. These, no doubt, have gradually been interpreted and developed in a more realistic direction by genera- tions of legislators and judges. But the further development of law as a "mechanism of social welfare' is now hindered by the relics of superstition incorporated in the ordinary conceptions of right, duty, justice. In judging criminals, for example, the idea of "guilt" inter- feres with the processes of punishment-which ought to be based simply on considerations of social utility. "The expressions (natural) justice, wrong, wrongful, lawful, legal right, fault and guilt, should be rejected", he concludes, "and not be retained, even as terms for or labels of certain realities" (p. i6)-in contrast, that is, with expressions like "liability", "owner", "rules of law" which Lundstedt is prepared to continue using, for practical reasons, even although they ordinarily contain metaphysical ingredients. Ross, on the other hand, is uneasy about the doctrine that a legal system can be, and ought to be, based on the ideal of "social welfare", which he regards as a metaphysical notion, an attempt to reinstate the idea of a "governing legal principle".' In Law as Fact Olivecrona presents a full-blown Hobbist theory of society, in which law is "justified" on the sole ground that the only alternative to a legal system is a state of anarchy, in which the native brutality and acquisitiveness of men would make a civilized life impossible. There is an interesting problem at this point, reminiscent of a question which arises within Hume's Treatise. Hume's general line of argument is very like that adopted by the Scandinavian school. I His criticisms appear in a number of Danish essays and books. I know them only through Lundstedt's reply (Legal Thinking Revised, pp. M71-80). '54</page><page sequence="13">HAGERSTROM'S PHILOSOPHY OF LAW Suppose, Hume argues, we take some such philosophical concept as "necessary connection", and ask ourselves what it amounts to in terms of actual experience. Then considering, say, two objects, A and B, which we ordinarily believe to be necessarily connected, the only relevant relation we find to hold between them is constant conjunction; experience reveals no "necessary connection". But mere "constant conjunction" cannot, by itself, account for the fact that when we experience A we feel compelled to expect B. What in fact happens, Hume concludes, is that our experience of constantly conjoined objects gives rise in us to a certain internal feeling-an internal necessity; we then wrongly suppose, by a form of projection, that this necessity objectively connects the constantly conjoined objects. There can be no metaphysical investigation, therefore, into "the nature of necessary connection" although there can be psycho- logical investigations into the origin of our idea of necessary connection.' Olivecrona's discussion of "legal bindingness" proceeds along exactly parallel lines. If we look at the relations holding between citizens and laws, we find no relation except, for example, the fact that the breaking of laws is sometimes followed by punishment. But such relations do not constitute the content of our idea of "legal bindingness". "Legal bindingness", then, can only be an idea in our mind, produced by our social experience but not directly copying any such experience. By "a sort of fiction"-to use Hume's phrase-we ascribe our feeling of being bound to the actual law itself, we think of the law as possessing the property of being intrin- sically obligatory upon us. Since this is an illusion, however, there can be no metaphysical inquiry into the nature of legal bindingness, but only a socio-psychological inquiry into the origin of our idea of it. Now Hume applied this same technique to a large number of every- day beliefs-our belief in personal identity, in external existence and so on-and decided that these were all without exception fictions. The effect, he tells us, was devastating; he could only preserve his equanimity by ignoring his own discoveries and behaving just as other men do-if in a somewhat chastened frame of mind. Suppose, similarly, we agree with the Scandinavians that the power of the law, as we now know it, rests in part on magical beliefs, superstitions, metaphysics. Then if we belong to the optimistic- rationalistic school of thought, the practical conclusion will no doubt be obvious; we shall say, simply, "Well, then, let us remove from the legal system the elements of magic, superstition, metaphysics". This is Lundstedt's approach. But one may wonder-and Hagerstrom seems to have some hesitation on this point-whether the legal I This interpretation of Hume is more fully worked out in my Hume's Intentions (I952). I55</page><page sequence="14">PHILOSOPHY system could survive such a purification; whether in fact a non- magical system could ever be sufficiently powerful to work effectively -or, whether, we might add, "rational reforms" are not likely to produce a reaction towards a less rational system, of the Hitler type. Sir John Pollock once remarked that ritual is to the law as a bottle is to liquor; you cannot drink the bottle, but, equally, you cannot cope with the liquor without the bottle. From our point of view, since we are seeking to understand, rather than to reform, the law, these considerations are perhaps not strictly relevant. But they naturally raise their head. One should at least be clear that from the doctrine that law is partly supported by fictions it does not immedi- ately follow that these fictions ought to be destroyed. (In his lectures, Olivecrona tells us,' Hagerstr6m used to say that man has risen above the level of animals not as animal sapiens but as animal mysticum.) One can raise similar questions in regard to the Scandinavian analysis of "rights". This is really too large a matter to be discussed as a mere addendum to the present paper; but the argument ought to be briefly sketched, if only as a further illustration of the school's analytic method. Their general line of reasoning might be para- phrased as follows: "There is a certain duality in the ordinary conception of a right. The possessor of a right is thought of at once, we might say, as having the legal system on his side, and as having the Universe on his side. Attempting to destroy one side of this dualism, a jurisprudentialist might argue that rights belong entirely to the realm of 'what ought to be', that, for example, men have a 'right' to possess property, even if no legal system has ever recognized this right. Then he will get into difficulties quite parallel to those which arise in giving an objective account of 'duties'. Alternatively he might attempt to be tough-minded, and maintain that to possess a right merely means to be certain of success in any one of a great range of legal actions. But this interpretation quite destroys what seem to be essential features of 'having a right'. We do not, in determining whether someone has 'rights' over certain property, for example, ask ourselves whether he would be sure to win every legal action which could turn on the question of his ownership. Indeed, this is something we could never be at all confident about; the owner might not have enough money to carry through the case, or might employ an incompetent counsel. And to say that he is the rightful owner if he has the right to win such cases-as distinct from actually being sure of success in them-is obviously circular. No doubt a person who has a right may be in a better legal position- in respect of that right-than a person who does not possess the right. But this better position is a consequence of possessing the right, not the meaning of that possession. 1 Preface to Inquiries, p. xxiii. I56</page><page sequence="15">HAGERSTROM'S PHILOSOPHY OF LAW Hagerstrom sums up the position as follows: "We mean both by rightful properties and rightful claims, actual forces, which exist quite apart from our natural powers; forces which belong to another world than that of nature, and which legislation or other forms of law-giving merely liberate. The authority of the state merely lends its help to carry these forms, so far as may be, over into reality. But they exist before such help is given. So we can understand why one fights better if one believes that one has right on one's side. We feel that there are mysterious forces in the background from which we can derive support. Modern jurisprudence, under the sway of the universal demand which is now made upon science, seeks to discover facts corresponding to these supposed natural forces, and it lands in hopeless difficulties because there are no such facts" (p. 5). Now this belief in "rights" is obviously magical, and Hagerstrom, in his studies of Roman Law, particularly emphasizes this side of the matter; he looks carefully at the actual procedures employed, say, in transferring rights over a slave to another person, and brings out the extent to which this formal process is regarded as a transfer of magical powers. The immense strength of Roman private law in contrast with Greek law, he suggests, derived from its reliance on firm magical rules rather than on general moral ideas. Yet, at the same time, belief in "rights", if it can be invigorating, can also be dangerous, for it can easily lead to fanaticism. Within a given community, fanaticism is checked by the coercive power of the legal system, which prohibits self-redress, but in relations between states, where no such coercive power exists, the notion of rights is quite peculiarly dangerous-a point Lundstedt and Olive- crona both emphasize. "The State", Olivecrona writes, "is deemed to vindicate its rights itself . . . it is regarded as entitled to use force to this end . . . no prohibiting imperative is associated with the use of violence in these cases . . . the ideas of right and justice are part and parcel of the armaments of every State" (p. 205). This does not mean that the Scandinavians entirely reject the possibility of a "Law of Nations", if all this means is that states do in general keep to certain rules in their relations with one another. But since this law is not, like internal law, backed by organized and regularized force, we are particularly liable to suppose that it has a metaphysical basis, which endows states with "natural rights". Herein lies the danger of the conception of a "Law of Nations". Our idea of a right, to express the matter summarily, has as its content "an ideal or fictitious power to control an object or to claim an action by another person" (Olivecrona, p. 94). There can, it follows, be no "science of rights" although there can be an inquiry into the origins of the idea and the influence it exerts in society. Does this mean that in the practice of the law the conception of I57</page><page sequence="16">PHILOSOPHY "a right" should be wholly dropped? Lundstedt thinks that it might be, but admits that in practice the step would be a difficult one to take. He puts "rights" in a third group between expressions like "guilt" and "fault", which must, he thinks, be wholly abandoned, and expressions like "liability" which are relatively harmless. Higerstr6m, Olivecrona and Ross-the latter in a quite detailed way-are much more concerned to pick out the realistic from the metaphysical ingredients in the conception of right, as it actually functions in judicial decisions. Ross, for example, examining the traditional distinction between "real" and personal "rights", main- tains that havoc has been created in jurispudence by the notion that real rights are mystical powers over things and personal rights are mystical powers over persons. But then he goes on to attempt a "rational reconstruction"-to use an expression which now has a certain vogue in philosophy-of the two notions, interpreting a "real" right as a right to certain specific objects (e.g. ownership of, or contractual rights to, a certain block of land), and a "personal" right as a right to objects which are not precisely specified, e.g. the right to select goods to the value of ?I,ooo. The importance of such "rational reconstructions", he argues, is that they draw attention to actual distinctions of structure which the law has only vaguely apprehended, and to principles of action with which the law works without being quite sure what it is doing, while removing the incon- sistencies to which metaphysical and mystical notions of "right" give birth. More generally, the conception of a "right" is useful in the practice of the law as a particular mode of expressing legal imperatives. If, for example, a law says that a workman injured in the course of his employment has a right to compensation, it by means of this language lays down patterns of conduct for employers, for judges, for adminis- trative officers. And it does this in a way which helps to damp down possible feelings of opposition; there is now associated with the payment of compensation the mysterious force of "right". Furthermore, just because it is an imaginary power, there is no difficulty in ascribing rights to babies, or lunatics, or juristic persons -and this is very convenient for legal purposes. The conception of "rights", Olivecrona argues, is interpolated between a certain act (say, the giving of a loan) and the action of a judge. What the legislator intends is that when certain actions take place (a refusal to pay back the loan) a judge will know how to determine the case, and administrative officers what subsequent steps to take. That is all that is strictly essential, from a purely executive point of view. But it is customary to speak of the giving of the loan as creating a "right" in the creditor, a right which the law then enforces. This fiction is convenient, because it enables us to i58</page><page sequence="17">HAGERSTROM'S PHILOSOPHY OF LAW talk generally, say, of "property rights"-which may be acquired in a variety of ways but which have, in every case, certain legal consequences. The idea of rights was not introduced into law merely as a method of achieving these convenient results; but they do exist, and, by reference to them, one can "justify", as distinct from explaining the origins of, the use of concepts like "right" in law. In this paper, I have restricted myself, for the most part, to an exposition of the views of the Scandinavian school, or rather, of such of their views as seemed to me central to the understanding of their standpoint. If I have not paused to criticize, this is partly because I have found the task of exposition sufficiently intimidating to absorb my whole attention. But I should also admit to a very considerable degree of sympathy with the views I have been expound- ing and perhaps I have unduly emphasized those aspects of the Scandinavian philosophy of law with which my sympathy is greatest. Like the Scandinavian school, I should lay it down as a pre- liminary requirement for a satisfactory philosophy of law that it should be anti-metaphysical. Yet equally, I should agree with them, the traditional positivistic theories of law do not give a realistic account of legal systems as we actually know them; rather they outline a legal system which they would take to be "ideal", one in which we would know exactly what we were being told to do, who was telling us to do it, and what we were going to get out of obedience and disobedience. But in legal systems as we actually encounter them the first two conditions are certainly not fulfilled: legal state- ments contain vague and metaphysical expressions, they are not commands, and the question of sanctions only arises in special cases. "The Law" floats above us as a system of imperatives, which we explore in detail only when we feel that our "rights" have been infringed (to see whether we have legal redress) or when we are threatened with the possibility of civil or criminal actions. The Scandinavian school take these striking features of our everyday attitudes to the law-which are very different from our attitudes, say, to somebody who is ordering us about-as their starting-point. Yet at the same time they deny that in fact there is a metaphysical entity called "the Law", or that its imperatives are "binding" upon us in some supra-natural sense of that word, or that we have, in virtue of our nature and situation, rights which the law ought to respect. The question, for them, is how these beliefs arise, and what function they play in the maintenance of a legal system. Their position-and it is mine too-is comparable to that of somebody who is quite convinced that religious beliefs are false, but is not prepared to maintain that they arise merely out of a wish I59</page><page sequence="18">PHILOSOPHY for "pie-in-the-sky". Whatever one thinks of the detailed teachings of the Scandinavian school-and I am in no position to judge very many of them-they have, I think, drawn attention to facts of which any satisfactory sociology of law must take account. Another important point in Higerstrom's philosophy of law is his consistently pluralistic approach. Consider the case of judicial decisions. Some philosophers of law have said that the judge, by an exercise in pure deduction, simply interprets the laws of the land, as they apply in a particular case; others that his decisions actually constitute the law. On the one view, he is a deductive mechanism; on the other view, the actual sovereign. Yet neither theory seems to be compatible with the actual procedures of judges. Sometimes they seem directly to "apply the law", at other times to be so inter- preting it as virtually to be making a new law. Any realistic account of the law, then, will have to recognize that amongst the factors influencing judicial decisions the patterns of conduct incorporated in legislative acts, in common law, in precedent, play an important, and sometimes the crucial, role, and yet at the same time that there are always other factors involved-these factors varying in character and strength from place to place and time to time. This means, of course, that there can be no simple straightforward answer to the sort of questions philosophers of law are accustomed to ask: to such questions as "What is the real, or essential, nature of a judicial decision?" One may be able to state in a very general way the kinds of factors which influence judicial decisions; but then will pass on to consider the importance of these factors in various judicial systems, or at different times in the history of a single judicial system, or with different judges in the same system. "Philosophy of law" will consist, simply, in carrying farther the sort of anti-metaphysical analysis in which Hagerstrom has engaged; for the rest, the traditional questions will be replaced by problems in sociology or-for one can inquire into the validity of the inter- pretative methods used by judges-by problems in the logic of law. All this may sound rather dull when it is contrasted with broad speculations about "the purpose of the law", or "the grounds of its validity" or "the essence of legal norms"; but at least it will help us to understand what actually happens in one of the most important areas of human conduct.
