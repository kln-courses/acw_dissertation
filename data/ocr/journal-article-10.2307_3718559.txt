<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME XLVI APRIL 1951 NUMBER 2 ASTROLOGY IN 'THE OWL AND THE NIGHTINGALE' Students of The Owl and the Nightingale are evidently less interested in astrology than was the Owl poet himself. There is either complete silence on the subject or, at the most, a passing reference to it, like that of Dr Hinckley, who writes: 'Judicial astrology, a subject of splendid poetic possibilities, he [sc. the author of The Owl and the Nightingale] dismisses briefly. The Nightingale declares that at any rate the Owl knows nothing about it. The poet's personal attitude was perhaps that others might or might not be able to foretell the future by the stars, but that he himself could not.'1 This article will try to show that the Owl poet may, in fact, have thoroughly exploited the 'splendid poetic possibilities' of astrology in producing what Hinckley regards as 'the finest description of the boding prophecies of the owl that I know of in all literature'.2 An attempt will also be made to show that the arguments used by the Owl in her reply to the Nightingale (11. 1175 ff.) have a close and familiar connexion with astrology. Further, it will be suggested that the alleged astrological allusions in The Owl and the Nightingale may help in fixing a new 'terminus a quo' for the date of composition of the poem. It would be surprising indeed if the author of The Owl and the Nightingale, a poem which 'enshrines in singular fashion the intellectual energies of an age, that marked a new phase in the civilisation of Western Europe',3 had been content to dispose of the whole problem of astrology in some three or four lines (11. 1317-20): Ich habbe iherd &amp; sop hit is. Pe mon mot beo wel storre wis. An wite innop of wucche ]inge kume. So pu seist pat is iwune.4 For the Renaissance of the twelfth century witnessed, among all its manifold intel- lectual activities, a revival of interest in astrology; and this learned superstition, although condemned by St Augustine and by all the philosophers and theologians who followed his lead in later centuries as an impious and fallacious form of divina- tion,5 became a focal point of study and discussion. It is open to doubt whether the patristic opposition to astrology, together with the decline of learning which followed the barbarian invasions, caused astrology virtually to disappear from 'the social and intellectual life of western Europe for eight centuries'.6 But it seems entirely accurate to speak of a revival of interest 1 H.

But Wedel underestimates the philosophical justification of astrology by Boethius in his De Consolatione Philosophiae, and the pervasive influence on the later Middle Ages of the Boethian thesis of the 'co-existence of the fatal series expressed in the stars, divine pro- vidence, and human free will' (L. Thorndike, A History of Magic and Experimental Science 11</page><page sequence="2">162 Astrology in 'The Owl and the Nightingale' in astrology during the twelfth century,' and to attribute this revival largely to the translation of the astrological writings of Ptolemy2 and of the works of the Arab astronomers and astrologers. And when one considers that much of this trans- lating was done by Englishmen,3 and reads of a Jewish astrologer, 'Abraham ibn Ezra, a native of Toledo, spending some time in London in 1158-59',4 it is difficult to believe that John of Salisbury's vigorous refutation of astrology in his Policraticus (c. 1159) was nothing more than a dutiful repetition of St Augustine.5 Admittedly, he follows the lead of the Church Fathers in associating astrology with the magic arts.6 Again, like St Augustine, he is chiefly concerned with combating the alleged astrological acceptance of a fatalistic rule over human events by the stars; any such belief, he maintains, is detrimental to God's sovereignty as well as opposed to the Christian doctrine of man's 'liberum arbitrium'.7 But although John of Salis- bury's attitude towards astrology may be described as 'that of the Church Fathers in mediaeval dress',8 it is incredible that his long and serious refutation of astrology was merely an 'academic discussion' of the subject, divorced from and unprovoked by the contemporary revival of interest in this old enemy of the Church.9 In spite of the traditionally hostile attitude of the Church towards astrology, a Christianized astrology, a blend of old and new elements, steadily gained ground. Owing much to Boethius and gradually reinforced by Ptolemaic astrology, Aris- totelian science and the work of the Arab astrologers, the 'new astrology' was already on the way to establishing itself in England by the end of the twelfth cen- tury. It had to wait until the following century for its final elaboration by the scholastic theologians, but the outline of it is already found in the De Naturis Rerum of Alexander Neckam (1157-1217), the Owl poet's contemporary. Neckam, like Boethius, had no difficulty in reconciling stellar influence, the divine will, and man's (Macmillan, 1923), I, 622). Further, he neglects the evidence, slight though it is, that astrology was very much alive as a practical art during the Dark Ages. 'The Theodosian Code teemed with enactments against Mathematici, meaning, of course, primarily the impostors who calculated nativities and cast horoscopes' (J. Hodgkin, Italy and Her Invaders, 2nd ed. (Oxford, 1896), II, 488). Hodgkin believes that the charge brought against Boethius of 'defiling his con- science with sacrilege' ('sacrilegio me conscien- tiam polluisse') and of 'using the aid of most vile spirits' ('vilissimorum me spirituum praesidia captare')-De Consolatione Philosophiae, Bk. I, Pr. 4-had to do with his interest and belief in astrology. More than four centuries later we find Elfric prefacing his insertion of an account of the planets in the Interrogationes, xxI, with the statement 'I will say now what I kept secret at an earlier occasion because of the evil practice of astrology'-quoted by H. Henel in his edition of AElfric's De Temporibus Anni (E.E.T.S. o.s. 213, 1942), p. 101. 1 See C. H. Haskins, The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century (Harvard, 1928), pp. 316-19. 2 Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos or Quadripartitunm, translated from Arabic into Latin by Plato of Tivoli in 1138. The translation of the Centilo- quium (the hundred astrological aphorisms falsely attributed to Ptolemy) evidently belongs to 1136. 3 Among them being Adelard of Bath, Robert of Chester and Roger of Hereford. In view of the possibility that the word foliot in 1. 868 of The Owl and the Nightingale is a pun on the name of Bishop Foliot, it may be worth pointing out that Roger of Hereford's chief work, the Compotus (1176), is dedicated to Gilbert, who is held to be none other than Gilbert Foliot, Bishop of Here- ford until 1163, and afterwards Bishop of London. See C. H. Haskins, Studies in the History of Mediceval Science (Harvard, 1924), p. 124. 4 Haskins, Studies, p. 128. 5 As Wedel, op. cit. pp. 39-41, seems to be- lieve. St Augustine's sustained attack on astro- logy is to be found in De Civitate Dei, the opening chapters of book v. 6 Policraticus, lib. I, cap. 12; ed. Webb, tom. I, pp. 52-3. 7 Policraticus, lib. II, caps. 19-20; ed. Webb, torn. I, pp. 111-15. 8 Wedel, op. cit. p. 39. 9 A far from academic hostility towards astro- logy in everyday life is evinced by a note found in some of the MSS. of William of Malmesbury's Gesta Pontificum Anglorum (1125), ed. N. E. S. A. Hamilton (Rolls Series, 52), p. 259. This note explains that Girard, Archbishop of York (d. 1108), whom the canons of York refused to bury in the church, was under suspicion of studying in secret the works of the astrologer Julius Firmicus.</page><page sequence="3">'liberum arbitrium animae'. The planets, he says, do not merely adorn the heavens, but exert upon inferiors the influence assigned to them by God. At the same time, God, their creator, is the personal cause of things, and to Him the heavenly bodies owe obedience. Further, there is no question of the stars imposing necessity upon the human will, which remains free.1 A similar attitude towards astrology, showing the same cautious subordination of it to theism, is shared by the astrologers who predicted the disasters that would, they claimed, follow the planetary conjunction of 1186. This conjunction of the planets, they said, signifies such and such dire events 'jussu Dei', 'si Deus voluerit', or 'si Deus aliter non providerit'; and one of them, William of Chester by name, adds that if princes look to themselves, serve God and flee the devil, God will avert the punishment that is imminent.2 These astrological predictions connected with the conjunction of the planets in 1186 illustrate the widespread interest in astrological divination found among English people towards the end of the twelfth century. According to both Benedict of Peterborough and Roger of Hoveden, everyone took the predictions of the astrologers very seriously, and all classes of the community were terrified as the fateful day (16 September 1186) drew near. 'His auditis, fiebat pavor mortis in populo', writes Benedict;3 Roger, at greater length, writes: 'Cum igitur hwec et his similia audisset populus, turbatus est valde, et quanto magis tempus illud pesti- ferum, quod preedixerant praefati astrologi, appropinquaret, tanto magis omnes pariter, clericos et laicos, divites et pauperes, maximus timor invasit, et quam plures illorum in desperationem traxit.'4 The above sketch of astrological developments in England during the twelfth century gives some grounds for believing that the author of The Owl and the Nightingale-alive as he evidently was to the intellectual interests of his day- would probably be conversant with the conflicting attitudes towards astrology expressed by contemporary writers like John of Salisbury and Alexander Neckam. In what follows it may be possible to establish that he was, in fact, keenly interested in astrological predictions and astrological doctrine, as well as to demonstrate that the Nightingale in 11. 1145-74 and later in 11. 1291 ff. suggests something of the traditionally hostile attitude of the Church towards astrology, while the Owl in 11. 1175-1290 suggests the apologist of a Christianized astrology. In making her charge against the Owl in 11. 1145-74 the Nightingale says that men are angry with the Owl, and that they fear and ill-treat her, because she is the bearer of evil tidings who is always announcing some misfortune or other and 1 De Naturis Rerum, bk.

CAWLEY</page><page sequence="4">164 Astrology in 'The Owl and the Nightingale' proclaiming 'futile secrets' ('unwreste rune'). She gives some details of the kinds of misfortune predicted by the Owl, and concludes by invoking against her God's anger and the anger of all respectable folk ('al pat weriep linnene clop'). Something very serious must be implied in this charge of the Nightingale in order to justify her extreme action in invoking God's anger against the Owl, for the prediction of evil would not in itself be a crime warranting excommunication. It will be necessary to discuss later on the Nightingale's subsequent explanation that she has been accusing the Owl of divination by means of sorcery and has cursed her because she is guilty of this abominable crime (11. 1309 ff.). But whatever may be implied in the Nightingale's charge, the fact to be noticed now is that this charge includes a number of specific misfortunes allegedly prophesied by her opponent which are definitely associated with evil stellar influences, and especially with the malign influence of the 'wicked planete, as Saturne or Mars or elles the Tayl of the Dragoun'.l Thus several parallels are to be found between the disasters listed by the Nightingale (11. 1149-60) and by the Owl (11. 1191-1206, 1215-16) and the mis- fortunes attributed to Mars and Saturn as planetary gods in Chaucer's poem The Knight's Tale (11. 1995 if., 2456 ff.).2 The Martian or Saturnian source of these disasters can also be confirmed from Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos.3 Further, there are parallels to be found in the disasters predicted, according to the astrologers Corum- phiza, William of Chester and Pharamella, by the planetary conjunction of the year 1186, in which the evil influence of Mars and Saturn was considered dominant. (A summary of these astrological predictions is given below, since it will be necessary to make several references to them later on.4) 1 Chaucer's Astrolabe, pt. ii, ch. 4. This and other quotations from Chaucer are taken from The Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, ed. F. N. Robinson (Oxford, n.d.). 2 The astrological attributes of Chaucer's Mars and Saturn in The Knight's Tale have been attested beyond all doubt. See, especially, W. C. Curry, Chaucer and the Mediceval Sciences (New York, 1926), pp. 122-30. 3 Edited and translated by F. E. Robbins (Loeb Classics, 1940). 4 Both Benedict of Peterborough and Roger of Hoveden, under the year 1184, give the epistle of an astrologer, Corumphiza by name, who tells of a conjunction of the planets in Libra ('planetse tam superiores quam inferiores convenient in Libra'), which was due to take place in Sep- tember 1186. According to Corumphiza, this conjunction signified, 'jussu Dei', that the countries of Europe would suffer an earthquake of extraordinary destructiveness and a terrific poisonous wind ('ventus vehemens et validis- simus, denigrans aera et feetore corrumpens venenoso'). There would also be strife and sedi- tion in some Western countries: 'In partibus quoque Occidentalibus orietur discordia, fientque seditiones in populo; et erit unus ex iis qui infinitos congregabit exercitus, facietque bellum secus littus aquarum, in quo tanta strages effi- cietur, quod impetus sanguinis effusi adsequa- bitur undis excrescentibus.' Also under the year 1184, Roger of Hoveden adds the astro- logical prophecies of 'Willelmus astrologus, clericus Johannis, constabularii Cestriae', and of the Saracen astrologer, Pharamella of Cordova. William states that the conjunction of the planets will take place on 16 September 1186, and that Mars will be 'dominus horse, Sole oriente, et planetis in locis suis'. After an imposing tech- nical description of the positions of the planets and zodiacal signs on this fateful day, he con- tinues: 'Sed quia Mars in orbe solis comburitur, impeditus et inter duos malos, Saturnum et caudam, obsessus et eorum naturam in se re- tinens, significat ex sui proprietate, tristitias, contentiones, timores, horrenda, interfectiones, substantiarum ablationes. Cauda quoque separa- tiones, detrimenta, pericula, rerum diminutiones.' Pharamella, who is writing to the Bishop of Toledo, is more reassuring in that he refutes the prediction made by 'falsi astrologi de Occidente' of a wind of extraordinary violence and destruc- tiveness. Nevertheless, he has to admit that according to the judgements of Messahala and Alkindi, 'si Deus aliter non providerit, erit vin- demia rara, messes mediocriter sufficientes, strages gladii multa, naufragia plura'. (The pages of Benedict and Roger summarized above have already been referred to on p. 163, n. 2.) It will be noticed that Corumphiza is alone in prophesying an earthquake and a poisonous wind; William and Pharamella content them- selves with less spectacular prophecies.</page><page sequence="5">The parallels which suggest that the Nightingale has evil planetary influences in mind include the following: Wane pu hauest ani3t igrad. Men bop of pe wel sore of drad. (11. 1149-50) These lines find an echo in the chroniclers' account of the general fear inspired by the astrologers' predictions in connexion with the planetary conjunction of 1186. (See p. 163 above.) IDu singst par sum man shal be ded. Euer pu bodest sumne qued. (11. 1151-52) The sentiment ofl. 1151 is found again in 11. 1192 and 1196. We learn from Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos that Saturn and Mars are, above all other planets, the bringers of death through disease or violence.1 IDu singst a3en ei3te lure. (1. 1153) Compare William of Chester's prediction of 'rerum diminutiones'2 and Ptolemy's statement that 'if the planets of the opposite sect overcome the governing places or rise after them, they bring about loss of possessions'.3 Oper pu bodes huses brune. (1. 1155) This line, which is repeated with a variation of wording in 1. 1203, recalls Chaucer's reference to the combustive influence of the planet Mars: 'The shepne brennynge with the blake smoke' (KtT, 1. 2000). Oper ferde of manne. oper p]oues rune. (1. 1156) There are echoes of this line in 11. 1191, 1204 and 1215. The first part of the line is paralleled by 1. 2002 of the KtT, which describes the influence of Mars the pagan god as well as that of Mars the planet: 'The open werre, with woundes al bibledde'. Corumphiza's prediction includes a prophecy of war and bloodshed, and Pharamella of Cordova prophesies 'strages gladii multa'.4 The second part of the line is paral- leled by the word 'Outhees', used with reference to the planetary influence of Mars, in 1. 2012 of the KtT. Chaucer's 'Outhees' is even more closely parallel to the word 'rem' in 1. 1215 of The Owl and the Nightingale. Oper p]u bodest cualm of oreue. (1. 1157) This line is echoed by 1. 1199. Since 'cualm' may have the specific meaning of 'plague' or 'pestilence' here, it is relevant to note that in Chaucer's KtT Saturn says of himself 'My lookyng is the fader of pestilence' (1. 2469), while Tetrabiblos, iv. 9 gives Mars as the planet that 'kills by means of... pestilences'.5 Oper pat londfolc wurp idorue. Oper pat wif lost hire make. Oper pu bodest cheste an sake. (11. 1158-60) With these lines (of which 11. 1159-60 are echoed later by 11. 1193-94) compare William of Chester's statement that Mars signifies 'tristitias, contentiones, timores, 1 Tetrabiblos, iv. 9; ed. Robbins, pp. 429 ff. fact that Chaucer makes Saturn the father of 2 See p. 164, n. 4. These words actually refer to pestilences, while Ptolemy assigns the paternity the evil influence of the Dragon's Tail ('cauda'). of them to Mars, it may be pointed out that the 3 Tetrabiblos, iv. 2; ed. Robbins, pp. 375, 377. distinction between the greater and lesser 'infor- 4 See p. 164, n. 4. tunes' was not consistently maintained. (See 5 Ed. Robbins, pp. 429, 431. In view of the F. N.

CAWLEY</page><page sequence="6">Astrology in 'The Owl and the Nightingale' horrenda, interfectiones', while the Tail signifies 'separationes, detrimenta, peri- cula'.1 A parallel to 1. 1160 may be found in the KtT, 1. 2003, where one detail of the description of Mars's temple is 'Contek, with blody knyf and sharp manace'. Compare also Henryson's 'Mars, the God of Ire, Of strife, debait, and all dissen- sioun' in The Testament of Cresseid (11. 183-4).2 It seems possible that 11. 1159-60 go together, and refer to the quarrels and divorces of married people. If they do, it is relevant to note Ptolemy's statement that the maleficent planets may, in certain aspects, cause marriage to be 'quarrelsome, unpleasant and unprofitable' or even 'cause divorces with abuse and violence'.3 God almi3ti wrpe him wrop. An al pat weriep linnene clop. (11. 1173-74) These lines may have been intended to bring to mind the ancient hostility of the Church towards astrology;4 at any rate, the strong condemnation expressed by them is reminiscent of the condemnation of astrology which St Augustine has made so emphatically in his Confessions, where he speaks of 'those impostors, whom they style astrologers.. .and yet doth Christian and true piety condemn that art'.5 Most of the lines in the Nightingale's charge (11. 1145-74) for which no parallels have been given above are either descriptive in general terms of the evil things predicted by the Owl or refer in concrete terms to the Owl as a bird. The Owl poet is careful to give us occasional reminders that his two disputants are, after all, only birds. He humanizes them, it is true, and their thoughts and feelings are inevitably those of men and women of his own day; but they never quite cease to be an owl and a nightingale. In her reply to the Nightingale's charge, the Owl tartly observes that the Nightin- gale, although unordained, is performing the office of a priest in cursing her. And this curse, she says, is motivated by ancient malice ('alde nipe').6 After that, she not only admits her power to foreknow the occurrence of those misfortunes men- tioned by the Nightingale, but proudly adds others to them. These additional misfortunes, it may be noticed, can equally well be assigned to the evil influence of Mars and Saturn as planetary gods. Ich wot pf hunger of hergonge. (1. 1191) The second part of this line is a variation of the first part of 1. 1156. The first part ('Ich wot of hunger') suggests such parallels as Tetrabiblos, iv. 8, 'If Saturn and Mars control the luminaries... [they] will involve the subject in great dangers... through lack of provisions'7 and Piers Plowman, B. vi, 11. 325-7, 'suche famyn shal aryse, Thorwgh flodes and pourgh foule wederes, frutes shul faille, And so sayde saturne and sent 3ow to warne'. Ich wot 3ef men schule libbe longe. (1. 1192) Compare the note on 1. 1151, of which this line is a variation. Ich wat 3ef wif luste hire make. Ich wat p]ar schal beo ni2p and wrake.

(1. 1205) Compare Tetrabiblos, iv. 9, where certain aspects of Saturn are said to bring death to human beings as 'the victims of shipwreck'.7 Pharamella predicts 'naufragia plura'.8 In Chaucer's KtT, Saturn claims that 'Myn is the drenchyng in the see so wan' (1. 2456).

The C-reading 'smipes' therefore agrees with the J-reading 'smithes'. It is uncertain whether 'smipes' here means 'carpenters' or 'workers in metals'. Hinckley, who takes 1. 1206 as an expansion of 1. 1205, would interpret 'smipes' as 'carpenters, ship-builders', and translate the line as follows: 'I know whether the ship-builders are going to clench (the nails) badly'. Atkins, on the other hand, gives the following translation of the J-reading: 'I know if smiths shall rivet badly, i.e. make defective arms and armour'. But, in any case, both smiths and ship-builders are subjects of Mars, according to whether or not he is 'in aspect with the sun' (Tetrabiblos, iv. 4).3 In Chaucer's KtT, 'the smyth, That forgeth sharpe swerdes on his styth' (11. 2025-6) also belongs to 'Martes divisioun'. Ich wat al of pe tacninge. (1. 1213) 'Tacninge' is usually taken to mean 'symbolism' or 'allegorical interpretation of Scripture',4 with reference presumably to the knowledge of the Gospel which the Owl has laid claim to in 11. 1209-12. This meaning fits the context well enough: the Owl may be saying, in effect, 'I know the hidden meaning of Scripture as well as I know other things concealed from the ordinary person who is not possessed of my gifts'. And, by making this claim for herself, she may be demonstrating not only the range of her learning, but also how devout and lawful her studies are. But another possible meaning of 'tacninge', namely 'betokening', 'presaging',5 would seem to make equally good sense in this context. If 1. 1213 means 'I know all about presaging or prognostication', it would link up quite well with the following and last item in the Owl's list of the misfortunes foreseen by her: 3ef eni mon schal rem abide. Al ich hit wot ear hit itide.6 (11. 1215-16) And it would link up equally well with the preceding lines (1209-12), which refer to the Owl's intimate knowledge of the Gospel. For the Scriptures, with their 'numerous allusions to, prohibitions of, and descriptions of the practice of magic, witchcraft, and astrology, enchantments and exorcisms, divination and interpreta- tion of dreams',7 would be a mine of information for anyone interested in divination and prophecies. Moreover, if the Owl had divination by astrological means especially in mind, both the Old and New Testaments would have provided her with plenty of examples. 'Balaam and his imprecations and enchantments and prediction that a star would come out of Jacob and a scepter out of Israel... the repeated use of the numbers seven and twelve, suggestive of the planets and signs of the zodiac, as in the twelve cakes of showbread and candlestick with seven branches... the wise men who saw Christ's star in the east; Christ's own allusion to the shaking of "the powers of the heavens"...the eclipse of the sun at the time of the crucifixion.' 7 The strong astrological colouring of the afflictions and disasters foreseen by the Owl (11. 1191-1216) suggests that the following lines (1217-32) are meant to be a 1 Hinckley, 'Notes on The Owl and the Nightin- 4 Thus Atkins, op. cit. in his note on this line. gale', p. 98. 5 See N.E.D., Tokening, 1. 2 Grattan and Sykes, op. cit. p. 37, note on 6 See p. 165, note on second part of 1. 1156.

C CAWLEY defence of astrological prognostications against the stock charge that, if true, they were useless since 'it is useless to foresee what must necessarily happen anyway'.1 This is what the Nightingale may have meant by her insulting remark about the Owl's 'unavailing secrets' ('unwreste rune', 1. 1170). Certainly, the words now used by the Owl are strongly reminiscent of Ptolemy's arguments in support of astro- logical prediction. The sentiment of Alfred's aphorism, which the Owl quotes in 11. 1225-6: 3ef pu isihst...he beo icume. His strncpe is him wel neh binume. is found, with reference to astrological divination, in Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos, i. 3: 'foreknowledge accustoms and calms the soul by experience of distant events as though they were present, and prepares it to greet with calm and steadiness what- ever comes.'2 Again, Ptolemy's distinction between troubles which cannot be averted but which may be borne with fortitude if they are foreseen and troubles which may actually be averted if they are foreseen and resisted in good time2 is also found in The Owl and the Nightingale, 11. 1227-32. In these lines the poet gives examples of the two different kinds of trouble: (1) mighty blows are weaker if one is warily on the watch for them, and (2) an arrow will miss its mark if its intended victim sees it fly from the string, for then he can dodge aside and escape it. William of Chester, it may be noticed, emphasizes the usefulness of his astro- logical predictions by pointing out that a remedy is possible: 'ut primates sibi consulant, Deo serviant, daemonem fugiant, ut Dominus eorum poenas avertat imminentes.' 3 L1. 1233-64 of the Owl's reply are devoted to the argument that she is not responsible for the evils she predicts, since foreknowledge of these evils does not involve responsibility for them. Whatever warnings I may give of imminent mis- fortune, she says, it all comes about by God's will: Ah pah ich grede lude an stille. Alhititid purp [sc. jPur3] godes wille. (11. 1255-56) This distinction between foreknowledge and foreordination is equally applicable to the power of God and the power of the stars; for the orthodox theological argument that God's foreknowledge of evil does not make Him the cause of it is easily trans- ferable to the stars, which are subject to His will. It is therefore quite possible that in 11. 1233-64 the Owl poet is replying to the charge of those Christian theologians who condemned astrology for the fatalism they found implicit in it. The Christian philosophers, represented by St Augustine in the fifth century and by John of Salisbury in the twelfth century, attacked astrologers for laying the responsibility for all that happens in this world, including all that is evil, either on the spotless stars or on God their creator. And they condemned the denial of human free will and the slur upon God's immaculate majesty which they held to be corollaries of this astrological fatalism. To an attack of this sort the astrologers could reply that the stars are either signs of God's will, with no power of their own to fashion future 1 Sextus Empiricus, quoted by Wedel, op. cit. avertere, quando naturam earum noverit, ac p. 7. seipsum ante illorum eventum praepare.'

'Potest qui sciens est multos stellarum effectus 169</page><page sequence="10">Astrology in 'The Owl and the Nightingale' events, or, at most, mere executors of His will.1 This being so, the power of the stars, undeniable though it is, is no less compatible with the reality of human free will than God's foreknowledge can be shown to be. In other words, the foreknow- ledge of evil expressed by the stars, and discoverable there by those who are 'star- wise', does not involve responsibility for that evil, any more than God's foreknow- ledge (of which the stars are, in one way or another, an expression) makes Him responsible for the ills that befall mankind. The Owl's example (11. 1237 ff.) of the blind man falling into a ditch-an accident which, she says, she could actually see happen without being in any way responsible for it-is reminiscent of the De Consolatione Philosophiae (Bk. v, Pr. 6): 'For doth thy sight impose any necessity upon those things which thou seest present?' 'No.' 'But the present instant of men may well be compared to that of God in this: that as you see some things in your temporal instant, so He beholdeth all things in His eternal present.... As you, when at one time you see a man walking upon the earth and the sun rising in heaven, although they be both seen at once, yet you discern and judge that the one is voluntary, and the other necessary, so likewise the divine sight beholding all things disturbeth not the quality of things which to Him are present, but in respect of time are yet to come.'2 The Owl's argument that she is no more responsible for things she sees in the future than she need be for things seen by her in the present is evidently one of ancient lineage. This mode of argu- ment, it will be noticed, is also applicable to both God and the stars: just as an earthly creature can see what is happening in the present without being the cause of it, so God, and therefore the stars who obey His will, can behold all things, past, present and future, as a changeless, eternal present without imposing any constraint upon them. The Owl now proceeds, naturally enough, to a moral discourse on the mutability of human wealth and happiness (11. 1265-80). In pointing out that the future is uncertain and fraught with possibilities of disaster, she adds weight to her previous argument that her prophecies of evil are of inestimable benefit to men by putting them on their guard against it. Although her discourse on the transitoriness of happiness and earthly possessions is expressed in aphoristic commonplaces to which proverbial parallels have been found,3 it is none the less possible that behind all this pious moralizing lies the doctrine of the De Consolatione that a man has only himself to blame for the misfortunes that arise from his abject dependence on merely human pleasures and possessions and the fickle happiness they may bring. God is not to blame, nor are the stars that are subject to him: the responsibility for evil rests with man himself. The Owl, who has some reason to feel pleased with herself after delivering this long and learned reply to the Nightingale's charge, now says, in effect, 'You can 1 Cp.

If so, 2 Quoted from the English translation of the one must admire the Owl's skill in adapting the De Consolatione Philosophiae given in the edition story to suit herself! of H. F. Stewart and E. K.

CAWLEY see that all your talk is foolish, for all that you say to shame me goes against you in the end and adds to my honour' (11. 1281-90). Whereupon the Nightingale, who is doubtless dismayed by the thoroughness and competence of the Owl's defence, asks irritably, 'What, are you mad, Owl? This is a strange wisdom ["seolliche wisdome"] you boast of, and you don't know where you get it from, unless it is by witchcraft' (11. 1298-1301). She then says that the Owl had been cursed long ago 'of prestes mupe' for her practice of witchcraft, and that the curse remains in force because she has not given up her evil practices (11. 1302-8). 'I told you this a short while ago, and you asked me in mockery if I had been ordained as priest' (11. 1309-11). She continues: 'I have heard it said- and true it is-that a man must be wise in star-lore to know the inner sources of the coming of any and every event, as thou sayest is true of thee' (11. 1317-20).1 'But what does a wretched thing like you, who do nothing, but look at the stars from afar, know about them?' (11. 1321-2).2 Finally, she insultingly compares the Owl with an ape: just as an ape may look at a book and be none the wiser for it, so the Owl may gaze at the stars, but with as little profit (11. 1325-30). It would be easy enough to accept without question the Nightingale's statement (11. 1309-11) that she has all along been accusing the Owl of witchcraft. But, like her opponent, she is a slippery customer in debate, and it is all too easy for a latter- day reader to be taken in by her 'wrenches'. Some kind of serious accusation must be implied in her original charge (11. 1145-74), it is true; but the fact remains that this charge contains no explicit mention of witchcraft, and that the specific mis- fortunes which she accuses the Owl of prophesying are closely associated with evil stellar influences. If witchcraft is implied in the Nightingale's charge, the Owl has ignored it in her reply; and, after an exultant restatement and amplification of misfortunes predicted by her that are Martian or Saturnian in origin, she proceeds to what can be interpreted as a thoroughgoing defence of astrological doctrine. And although astrology is nowhere openly referred to by the Owl, the probability of this being the subject of her discourse is strengthened by the nature of the Nightingale's rejoinder, in which she so emphatically and derisively denies the Owl's possession of astrological lore. Nevertheless, in spite of appearances to the contrary, the Nightingale's subsequent explanation that she has been accusing the Owl of sorcery may well be an approxi- mation to the truth. For it is quite possible that the Nightingale had made no clear distinction in her mind between astrology and necromancy when she brought her original charge. Her confusion of the two would not be at all surprising since she had patristic authority for regarding astrology as a diabolical form of divination. St Augustine explains away the successes of astrologers by attributing them to the intervention of evil spirits, and denies that they have anything to do with the pretended art of discerning the horoscope.3 Boethius, it will be remembered, came 1 The original lines translated here are quoted 3 De Civitate Dei, lib. v, cap. 7: 'His omnibus above, p. 161.

In the twelfth century, John of Salisbury follows the lead of the Church Fathers in classifying astrology as one of the magic arts.1 The accusation implicit in the Nightingale's original charge may, then, be an ambiguous one, which could refer equally well to astrology or to necromancy. So that when the Owl puts up her successful defence of astrology against the stock charges of uselessness and fatalism, the Nightingale is able to fall back on an overt accusation of sorcery. She is determined to have it one way or the other: as the Owl is eloquent enough to make astrological divination look orthodox and respectable, there is still one thing left for the Nightingale to do-to pour scorn on the Owl's astrological pre- tensions and denounce her as a witch. And in doing this, she may not be unin- fluenced by the example of St Augustine himself, who concludes his long, closely reasoned refutation of astrological doctrine and practice by bluntly asserting that the intervention of evil spirits is responsible for the successful predictions of astro- logers, and not their astrological art, which is non-existent ('quae nulla est ). True, the Nightingale does not go all the way with St Augustine in maintaining that the so-called art of astrology is a complete fraud; but then, her purpose is different from his, and so therefore is her mode of argument. St Augustine is intent on discrediting all astrologers; the Nightingale is concerned only with discrediting one of them-her opponent, the Owl. Consequently, rather than try to refute the learned arguments that the Owl has advanced in support of astrology, it is easier for her to admit the validity of the astrological art as such, but at the same time deny that the Owl knows anything about it. The substance of her thoughts may be summarized as follows: 'A man who is learned in astrology can foretell the future from the stars; but you know nothing about the stars, so it follows that you must get your "strange wisdom" by practising necromancy.' The foregoing interpretation of the discussion between the Nightingale and the Owl in 11. 1145-1330 gives rise to a number of questions. Why, for instance, if the two birds are really discussing astrology, is there no mention of it by name in the Nightingale's original charge (11. 1145-74) or in the Owl's reply (11. 1175-1290), and why do we have to wait so long for the first direct reference to it in 11. 1317-20 of the Nightingale's rejoinder? More than one answer to this question is possible. To begin with, the Nightingale may be held to have a good tactical reason for presenting obscurely the accusation contained in her original charge; it is tempting indeed to credit a skilled debater like the Nightingale with deliberately making this accusation obscure and ambiguous, in the hope that the Owl in her reply will leave herself undefended at some point. This hypothesis is consistent with what happens afterwards. The Owl, it would seem, assumes that her opponent's accusation is really aimed at her practice of astrology, and so she learnedly tries to refute the charge of 'inevitable necessity', which was one of the main heresies imputed to astrologers. But she does not try to defend herself against a possible charge of sorcery. Therefore the Nightingale, quick to seize her opportunity, at once decides to bring an open charge of sorcery and to discriminate between sorcery and astro- logy, as it now suits her purpose to do so. Again, just as the Nightingale has a motive for mystifying her opponent, so the poet too has a motive for mystifying his audience. For, assuming that some of the topical allusions discovered by scholars in the poem are really there, it is evident that the poet intended to suggest 1 Policraticus, lib. I, cap. 12. See above, p. 162, n. 6. 172</page><page sequence="13">A. C. CAWLEY1 more than he says on the surface, and that a good deal of the poem's interest was meant to lie in its tantalizing, half-concealed allusions to contemporary events and currents of thought. Apart from the poet's deliberate attempt to mystify his hearers, there is also the possibility that he did not consider it judicious to make the Owl's defence of the 'new astrology' an overt one, in view of the traditional hostility of the Church towards this 'species impietatis decipula'. But this last explanation seems hardly likely, for by the end of the twelfth century there cannot have been much danger in making an outspoken defence of the new astrological theories, judging by the fact that we find Alexander Neckam openly supporting a Christianized astrology with arguments which are basically similar to those used by the Owl. Is an astrological interpretation of 11. 1145-1330 compatible with any of the allegorical interpretations which have been made of The Owl and the Nightingale? This question cannot be answered adequately without a detailed examination of all the various interpretations that different scholars have made of the theme of the poem, and this is not the place for such an examination. But if the problem of interpreting the poem is reduced to its simplest possible terms, it may be said that the poet has humanized his two birds by utilizing the anthropomorphic traditions associated with them; and that in doing so he has built up and effectively opposed two very different attitudes to life. It is therefore not surprising to find the Owl, with her traditional wisdom, learning and powers of prophecy, interested in astrology and versed in the philosophical doctrines relating to it. Her thoughtful, far-sighted attitude to life goes well with her skill in astrology, the art of 'pondering and calcu- lating the event of things'. Further, her acceptance of a moderate, Christianized astrology would not be inconsistent with her religious and clerical pretensions. On the other hand, there may not appear to be any good reason why the Nightingale should be a mouthpiece of the ancient ecclesiastical hostility towards astrology. And yet it is appropriate enough that the Nightingale, who has no real claim to learning or wisdom or, indeed, to anything more than her native wit, her skill in song, and her full-blooded enjoyment of the passing moment, should be hostile to a learned superstition like astrology, with its unnecessary concern for the future and the evil it may bring. Her native wit would no doubt prompt her to attack the Owl's astrological predictions in an effort to show up her opponent's heretical doctrines and impious meddling with the occult. But it is her want of learning that makes her out-of-date on the subject of astrology and unaware that it can be defended on orthodox and thoroughly respectable grounds. If the alleged astrological allusions in the poem have any validity, it may not be too fanciful to imagine that the struggle between the Nightingale and the Owl reflects something of the enmity between Venus and Saturn that formed part of astrological mythology. The nightingale is traditionally the bird of love; the owl is the traditional prophet of things evil. What better symbols could there be for the astrological attributes of Venus and Saturn? After all, the opposition between the two birds is realized in terms of contemporary interests: it is therefore reasonable to suppose that something of the astrological Venus-Saturn conflict has gone into the making of the poem. The suggestion has already been made in this article that the parallels discernible between the disasters predicted by the Owl and the disasters predicted by the twelfth-century astrologers may, if considered together with other relevant evidence, 173</page><page sequence="14">174 Astrology in 'The Owl and the Nightingale' help to establish the astrological significance of the Owl's predictions. But perhaps it would be justifiable to go further than this, and inquire whether the resemblances between the predictions in the poem and the astrological predictions of William of Chester and Pharamella may establish, not merely the astrological significance of 11. 1145 ff. of The Owl and the Nightingale, but also the possibility that they are a topical allusion to the famous planetary conjunction of 1186. It is incredible that the Owl poet should not have shared in the general excitement caused by the astrological predictions connected with this year. The predictions of evil happenings made by the astrologers on the strength of the dominant positions of Mars and Saturn in the imminent conjunction of the planets must have been well known to him. The Owl, as the traditional prophet of evil, is so obviously a good symbol of the boding astrologer. It seems unlikely, therefore, that the poet would fail to equate the two, or that he would equate them without some reference to the astro- logical predictions connected with the year 1186. If a topical allusion to the planetary conjunction of 1186 is really to be found in the poem, we are given a 'terminus a quo' in the neighbourhood of this year for the date of composition of the poem. The allusion, if such it is, can hardly have been made earlier than 1184, the year under which the predictions of William of Chester and the Saracen astrologers are recorded by the chroniclers Benedict and Roger, so that any dating based on it is bound to corflict with the earlier dates proposed by Dr Hinckley and Dr Huganir.1 It is not, however, irreconcilable with the strong evidence afforded by 1. 1091 of a date subsequent to 1189. The conjunction of the planets in 1186 inspired such strong fear and excitement that it might well have been remembered and talked about for some years after- wards. Indeed, the chronicler Hoveden, who records this astral event so fully, was probably writing 'very soon after the death of his patron Henry II'.2 We may therefore suppose that the Owl poet was capable of alluding to the same event at a date later than 1189. In conclusion, it must be admitted that the speculation indulged in above is entirely dependent on the validity of the main thesis of this article that 11. 1145-1330 of The Owl and the Nightingale are tacitly concerned with astrological predictions and with a defence of astrological doctrine.
