LucE, Editor-in-Charge Fogg Museum of Art, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. NECROLOGY Sir Cecil Harcourt-Smith.- The London Time8s for March 99, 1944, reports the death of this emi- nent archaeologist on March 97, at the age of eighty-four. Born on September 11, 1859, he was educated at Winchester, and in 1879 joined the staff of the British Museum, in the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities, of which he rose to be Keeper in 1904. During that period, he helped to found the Classical Revie'w, and wrote many books and articles on the objects under his care. In 1887 he was temporarily absent on a diplo- matic mission to Persia, and from 1895 to 1897 he was given leave of absence from the Museum to become Director of the British School at Ath- ens. His service to the School was noteworthy- to him is due the founding of its Annual (BSA.) and the beginning of the important excavations at Phylakopi in MIelos. Leaving the British Mu- seum in 1908, he went to the Victoria and Albert Museum, of which he became Director in 1909 (when he was knighted) and continued in that post till 1925. In that year he became Adviser for the Royal Art Collections and in 1928 Surveyor of the Royal Works of Art, a post he held till the death of George V. Sir Cecil became the recipient of many honorary degrees and other honors, both from his own country and other nations-was made a C.V.O. in 1917, and was promoted to K.C.V.O. in 1934. His publications include many in Greek archaeol- ogy. To the older workers in this field he was a much beloved colleague, while the younger justly regarded him as one of the truly great figures and pioneers in the profession. S.B.L. Stanley Casson.- Announcement is made that Lieutenant-Colonel Stanley Casson was killed in action in April, 1944. This well known British archaeologist was born in May, 1889, and after serving with distinction through the First World War, was Assistant Director of the British School at Athens in the years immediately thereafter (1919-1922) and went from there to a post at Oxford. He was well known to Americans, not only through his service in Athens, but as a Visit- ing Professor at Bowdoin College in 1933-34, when he also gave lectures before various Socie- ties of the Archaeological Institute, and read a paper at the General Meeting in Washington in 1933. In 1928-29, he conducted excavations in the Hippodrome at Constantinople. He was the au- thor of many books-to archaeologists perhaps the best known is his completion of the late Guy Dickins' Catalogue of the Acropolis Museum- and during this war had written two others - Greece Against the Axis and Greece and Great Britain. He leaves his widow and one daughter. His death makes a vacancy among archaeologists in his own country which will be hard to fill, and registers his name among the glorious group in our profession who have given their lives for the cause of freedom and decency. S.B.L. William Ledyard Rodgers, Vice-Admiral, U. S. Navy, retired, died after a long illness at the Na- val Medical Center, Bethesda, Md., on May 7, 1944, at the age of eighty-four. Coming of a fam- ily identified with the United States Navy since its inception, he was graduated from the Naval Academy in 1878, and assumed the career of his forefathers, serving on various ships and stations, and rising through the grades until, at the time of the First World War, he was Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet with the rank of Vice-Ad- miral. In 19924 he was retired, having reached the age limit for active service, and after his retire- ment took up research in naval history, his schol- arly book, Greek and Roman Naval Warfare, the work of many years of travel and close study, appearing in 1937 (reviewed by Eugene S. Mc- Cartney in AJA. xlii, 1938, pp. 186-187). This book is of value to archaeologists and historians as being perhaps the only one of its kind in Eng- lish to be written by, and from the point of view of, a professional seaman and naval officer. It was followed by one other book (on mediaeval naval 274</page><page sequence="2">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 275 warfare up to the Battle of Lepanto) and a num- ber of articles on the same and related subjects, all of which were of great originality and interest. His two books were published by the United States Naval Institute, of which he had previ- ously, in 1923-24, been President. He was un- married, and is survived only by a sister. S.B.L. Lacey Davis Caskey, October 22, 1880-May 20, 1944.-In Lacey Caskey the world loses both a distinguished scholar and a most lovable and gifted personality. Born at Honesdale, Pennsyl- vania, the son of the Reverend Taliaferro F. Caskey and Phoebe Lacey, he lived and was edu- cated from 1882 to 1897 at an English school in Dresden, where his father was chaplain, and there he acquired a facility in languages which was to be of great service in his later work. After a bril- liant career at Yale, he went in 1902 to the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, where he was a Fellow and, from 1905 to 1908, Secretary, eventually becoming a member of its Managing Committee. The six years he spent in Greece, broken only by a short period as instructor at Yale, were all-important in shaping his future. Not only did he lay a firm foundation for a pro- found knowledge of Greek art in many phases, but he developed a feeling for its underlying spirit and a sensitiveness to nuances of expression which went far beyond the learning of the pro- fessional archaeologist. His earlier studies were mainly in Greek architecture and Greek building inscriptions. He published a number of articles in this field, and in 1905 undertook a record of the building inscriptions on the Erechtheum, which appear in the book on that building published in 1927 by Gorham P. Stevens and James M. Paton. In 1906, also, he compiled a still unpublished draft of a dictionary of architectural terms used in Greek inscriptions, which was submitted for a prize at the University of Strasbourg and was awarded half the prize. But at the same time he did much work on Greek sculpture and Greek vases, subjects which were to form the major in- terest of his mature years. Meanwhile, in the American and British Schools at Athens he became one of a circle of friends and colleagues whose in- terests and ideals matched his own, among them Sidney Deane, Guy Dickins, and Bert Hill; and in their society, and later in that of J. D. Beazley and of younger men working in the same field, he found invaluable understanding and encourage- ment. In 1908 he was appointed Assistant Curator of Classical Antiquities in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and in 1912 became full Curator. In the Museum centered the main work of his life. His earlier years there were a period of great im- portance in the development of the Museum's classical collections. E. P. Warren and John Marshall in Europe, collaborating with Arthur Fairbanks in Boston, had brought together much notable material; and it was fortunate for the Museum and for students of classical art and ar- chaeology, that to a man of Caskey's learning, per- ception, and taste, fell the business of studying and developing the collection. Thenceforward practically all Caskey's published work was con- cerned with or centered round objects in his de- partment. As a writer he was not prolific. His in- curable modesty always made him doubtful whether what he had to say was worth saying; while his critical faculty made him contemptuous (so far as he was capable of contempt) of magpies masquerading as scholars and of aesthetic out- pourings. But when enthusiasm for an object, a sense of duty, and pressure from colleagues, com- bined to induce him to write, he wrote with great felicity. Words did not come easily, however. Not only had the ideas to be right, but they had to be expressed exactly; so that a short article might be the labor of weeks, until both thought and language had a clarity and precision which were themselves Greek. The worth of his contribution to the study of classical art and archaeology can only be properly assessed by fellow scholars, but a very much wider circle were in his debt for all he did to help them understand classic art. Colleagues working in other fields found in what he wrote something that made the dry bones of scholarship live. He was interested in archaeology, but art was a seri- ious matter. Those who sought his help in the Museum found him almost embarrassingly spend- thrift of time and knowledge on their behalf. The idlest query, either in person or by letter, engaged his full attention; and to help, so far as he could, seekers after knowledge he held one of the most important duties of a curator. But it was in the installation of his department that he perhaps made his greatest contribution to inspiration and general enlightenment. Spot light- ing, startling comparisons, arresting placards, and similar devices to attract and focus attention he regarded with horror, since for him they obscured the essential qualities of any great art. With his- torical sequence as a basis, on the ground that</page><page sequence="3">276 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY works of the same period together create an at- mosphere favorable to understanding each one of them, he relied upon balance and harmony in arrangement and subtle use of color. Pale blue- gray walls helped to bring out the warmth of marble, so that even on a dull day a suggestion of sunshine was present; cases planned in shape and in character of bed and background set off the special quality of the objects they contained; and pedestals and other furniture, in shape, propor- tion, and color all fitted harmoniously into the design. But perhaps Caskey's most notable power was so to isolate and display the finest works in his charge that, without being over-dramatized, they became nodal points in the collection. The result looked so inevitable and so easy to attain, that the setting was forgotten and only the ob- jects remained. Caskey's main enthusiasms were, however, set against a larger background. His modesty and reticence concealed a wide range of interests, especially in literature and the arts. It masked also a rare integrity and firmness of purpose. Circum- stances might put obstacles in the way of right doing, but that did not change what ought to be done. He lived in no ivory tower. The war, for example, distressed him deeply, to the extent of affecting his physical health; and with a knowledge and understanding of Germany far greater than most of us have, he never wavered in believing that no sacrifice was too great to resist totalitarian aggression. Yet those who knew him intimately, and rejoiced most in the sincerity and distinction of his mind, may remember him best by the ex- pression of those characteristics in everyday life - his pleasure in casual conversation, his delight in a garden, his understanding of children, and his enjoyment of a well written detective story. W. G. Constable A brief obituary of Dr. Caskey will also be found in BMFA. xlii, 1944, pp. 37-38. Hans Seger.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 84, reports the death of Dr. Hans Seger, honorary Professor of Prehistoric Archaeology at the Uni- versity of Breslau, and former Director of the Municipal Art Collections, during the autumn of 1943, at the age of seventy-nine. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Winthrop Bequest. - One of the most important events for the study of art and archaeology in America in 1943 was the bequest to the Fogg Museum of Harvard University of the collections of Grenville L. Winthrop. A graduate of Harvard College in the Class of 1886, he had made impor- tant gifts to the Museum during his lifetime. Bull. Fogg Mus. x, pp. 25-71 (Nov. 1943) is entirely devoted to the description and illustration of the more important examples of the collection. Of the objects of the Art of the Far East, there are twelve pages of illustrations without text (cover illustration and pp. 29-39 incl.) and on pp. 69 and 70 are examples of Aztec and Peruvian art. The number begins (pp. 26-28) with an apprecia- tion of the collections, and a tribute to Mr. Win- throp's memory, by EDWARD W. FORBES and PAUL J. SACHS. Besides the groups to be sum- marized separately elsewhere in this Department (the Egyptian and Iranian) other parts of the col- lection are described by JAKOB ROSENBERG (Early Flemish Paintings and Prints, pp. 47-52), AGNES MONGAN (Drawings and Water-Colors, pp. 53-57), and WILLIAM A. JACKSON (Books and Manuscripts, p. 71). Lutzenguetle, Liechtenstein. - The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 67, reports that researches carried out by the Historical Society of the Principality of Liechtenstein have recently unearthed a Stone Age settlement kindred to those discovered near Cazis (Grisons) and Mels (St. Gall). It is the third place of the Alpine Neolithic culture to be dis- covered -a culture quite unknown until recently, and contrary to those of the Swiss lowland, show- ing strong influence of the Michelsberg culture, and of an unknown archetype. Among the new finds, staghorn mountings are totally missing, but a great number of flint utensils have been found. In addition, the Society has made finds of the Late Bronze and Iron Ages. Lycksele, North Sweden.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 61, announces that finds made by peasants in this area seem to belong to a large Stone Age settlement, and are considered to be about four thousand years old. This part of the country, which is very difficult of access, has not yielded very much evidence of settlements of this age, up to this discovery. Csomafa, Transylvania.- At a site where some years ago Roman finds were made, new investiga- tions have been begun by MICHAEL PXRDUCZ Of the University of Szeged, who has located three Stone Age settlements. At the same time and lo- cation, ZOLTAN SZI)KELY has uncovered remains of walls belonging to a hall and outhouses of Roman origin (The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 73). Spanish West Sahara.-In a cave near Rio de</page><page sequence="4">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 977 Oro, JULIO MARTINEZ SANTA OLALLA, Director of Archaeological Excavations, has discovered much Stone Age pottery, as well as very large tumuli of the Berbers, containing granite cham- bers with sarcophagi and vessels for offerings (The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 87). Liineburg.-At Melbeck, near this place, a tomb dating from the end of the Stone Age was discovered in the course of building operations. The tomb equipment included a carved goblet with fine decorations, arrow-heads, a stone hatchet and a knife. The objects are typical for this part of the world (The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 61). Litom&amp;lice (Leitmeritz).- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 71 reports that near this place a large Late Neolithic necropolis has been discovered. Three new tombs have recently been opened, containing characteristic pottery of the corded ceramic type, and ornaments of shell discs and of wolf's teeth. Koloszvar (Cluj).- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 87, reports the progress of excavations con- ducted by the Archaeological Section of the Transylvanian Scientific Institute, under the di- rection of JULIUS LASZL6 and STEFAN MERI. In the main square of the city, evidence was ob- tained of the existence of Neolithic and Bronze Age settlements. These settlements prove that the region was settled much more densely in those times than in the following periods. Ruins of a Roman villa have also been uncovered. These finds enable us to trace the whole history of the colonization of the area. The first human settle- ments date in the later Stone Age; between the prehistoric and the Roman periods there are no traces of human habitation, nor between the Ro- man period and early Hungarian times. Pecs. - The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 64, reports on excavations carried out at Nagyarpad, near this place, by JULIUS TOROK. A settlement of the Early Bronze Age has been discovered- remains of 32 dwelling houses had up to the time of writ- ing been laid bare. Vessels with incised decoration of the so-called textile style and other utensils have been found relatively intact. Furthermore, other objects from the later Bronze Age, and the Hallstatt, La Thne and Roman periods and from the Hungarian Middle Ages indicate that at this site there was an important station on the road connecting the Balkans with the West. In ibid., p. 75, it is announced that the mediaeval walls of Pecs, still well preserved on the north and west sides, have been restored, preserved, and the houses hiding them removed. See also AJA. xlviii, 1944, p. 93. Oslo,-On a rocky wall on the Oslo fiord, under a thick covering of moss, 24 prehistoric drawings of ships have been discovered. The larg- est is 1.80 m. long, and represents a ship with a deck-house like a tent on her stern, while the line of the keel terminates in two beaks decorated with animal heads. Chalbury Camp, Dorset.-In AJ. xxiii, 1943, pp. 98-121, MARGARET WHITLEY presents a sum- mary report of excavations conducted in 1939. The site is an Iron Age hill-fort, stratified above Late Bronze Age material. The Iron Age material may be divided into two phases. The earlier is marked by a post-pole hut of timber, by unde- veloped haematite and situlate pots, and finger- print decorations. To the second phase belongs a round stone hut (diam. 33 ft.) without central roof support or focal hearth. Phase 1 may be dated perhaps during the first half of the fourth century B.C.; phase 2, before the middle of the first cen- tury, by which time the stone hut had ceased to be inhabited. Early Iron Age in England. - The London Times for March 7, 1944, prints an article by SIR CYRIL Fox, Director of the National Museum of Wales, regarding the discovery in 1943, at a point a few miles from Holyhead, Anglesey, of a collection of some 90 objects of bronze and iron, "which touches life and art in Celtic antiquity at more points than any deposit hitherto found in Wales." The objects are now in the National Museum of Wales at Cardiff. The collection includes weapons, parts of vehicles and of harness, gang-chains for captives, currency bars and other things of social and economic interest, and ceremonial and per- sonal objects. They were found imbedded in peat, and were associated with animal bones (horse, ox, pig, sheep and dog). The chronological range is be- tween 100 B.C. and 50 A.D., the most brilliant period of Celtic prehistoric civilization in Britain. Some of the objects are of Irish origin, showing the, continuance of export of metal-work into the Iron Age; the majority, however, are of Lowland British work of Iron Age B and C. The collection is that of a family of chieftains, living at a point accessible to travellers or traders from all parts by land or sea. Some of the objects show evidence of having been repaired in antiquity, but such work is of the roughest type. Of the parts of harness, the bits are the most remarkable; they are all snaffles, suitable for ponies. Some are of bronze-</page><page sequence="5">278 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY coated iron, others of bronze. One of the latter is illustrated, and reveals a design new to Celtic art history in Britain. It was made for use in a two- horse chariot. Other objects are described. The "currency bars" present a problem, as they ap- pear over 100 miles from the grouped pattern of earlier finds; and the gang-chains, still strong enough in 1943 to be used by a tractor to pull motor trucks out of the mud, are of a type previ- ously found only in Kent or Cambridgeshire, and dated in these places shortly before the Claudian conquest. The finds can be explained as belong- ing to a wealthy family or community, which dwelt on the margin of a little Anglesey lake for a century and a half, being especially prosperous between ca. 75 B.C. and 25 A.D. The lake silted up with peat until it is now a bog. The cause of the discarding of these objects may well have been the battle at Mona, described by Tacitus, of Suetonius Paulinus and his legions against the Druids and their following. The discovery and its accompanying article is considered by the Times of sufficient significance to warrant an editorial in the same issue, in which the inferences drawn are ably summarized. Kristianstad, South Sweden. - The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 53, reports that at this place numerous tombs have been found in a hill, that in prehistoric times was surrounded by water. They are sur- rounded by a ring of boulders, in the middle of which a monolith had been set up. One of the tombs contained a bronze needle, three beautiful arrow-heads, several utensils and an ornamented clay urn. Hjoerring, North Jutland.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 73, reports that during ploughing a tomb was discovered, containing ten stone urns with incised decoration, and associated with them a bronze fibula and one of silver. Further investigation has revealed a smelting furnace - only one other has been found in Denmark. New Spanish Institute.--In College Art Jour- nal iii, pp. 24-26, WALTER W. S. COOK announces that the Instituto Amattler de Arte Hispanica has been founded in Barcelona, by Josk GUDIOL, as a -center for research and publication in Spanish art. It already has a collection of 140,000 negatives of works of art, including many objects destroyed in the Spanish Civil War, and more are constantly being added. It is hoped to make this Institute a center for research by Spanish scholars, and pub- lications are being planned. It is also hoped that after the war American students may be given opportunity, through fellowships, to go to Spain to work on their dissertations in these surround- ings, which will be open to the public of every nation. Rome. -Announcement is made in The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 64, that the Palazzo Venezia, the collections of which have not been generally accessible, is to be arranged as a State Museum after the war. Salzburg.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 55, announces the arrangement by the Municipal Museum of an exhibition, in the arcades of the cloister of St. Peter's, giving a survey of the ar- tistic production of the Salzkammergut from pre- historic times up to the Renaissance and Baroque periods. Maribor.-In the citadel the German authori- ties have arranged a Museum of Lower Styria (Untersteirische Museum) with sections of ar- chaeology and folklore. They have changed the name of the city to Marburg. (The Aew Pallas vii, 1943, p. 54). Trent.- According to The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 69, the Archaeological Museum in this city has been destroyed by bombs. EGYPT Saqqara.- ILN. Feb. 26, 1944, pp. 247-249 (9 figs.), gives a report by GuY BRUNTON on the work of the last three years at Saqqara, under the Egyptian Department of Antiquities. It consists of an examination of the pyramid complex of King Unas, the last king of the Fifth Dynasty (ca. 2655-2625 B.c.). There was a temple adjoining the east face of the pyramid, from which a cause- way ran to a lower or "valley'" temple, at the edge of the desert. The principal work was to complete the excavation of this causeway, and to uncover this lower temple. It was found that the founda- tions of the causeway were, in some places, reused blocks from the step-pyramid of King Zoser, of the Third Dynasty. A number of rock-cut tombs of the Fifth Dynasty were also discovered in the course of the work, one of which, of a certain Akhet-hotep, contained 10 wooden statues of dif- ferent sizes, mostly in excellent preservation, and a wooden stele, showing the deceased seated be- fore a table of offerings. Another tomb, of Ptah- iruk, had a series of rock-cut statues in niches, with the coloring well preserved. A third tomb, of Ptah-nefer-her, was interesting, in that its beau- tifully painted decorations were never finished, and showed clearly the way in which the artist</page><page sequence="6">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 279 worked. Part of the causeway is to be recon- structed, so that all the surviving blocks of sculpture can be exhibited in their natural setting, and still be protected from weather. The "valley" temple is still being excavated. The lowest con- struction appears to have been a quay, which the Nile reached during the inundations, behind which is a retaining wall with a terrace, on which the temple was built. On the pavement (to a great extent intact) was found a sarcophagus of green schist, the lid so constructed that it could not be removed by robbers. Water had, however, seeped into the tomb, so that the mummy and its wooden coffin were in a state of decomposition, but the bones were still fairly intact. On the right upper arm was a plain gold band, while on the wrist was a gold wire (which by rights should have been round the neck) on which was a carnelian bead. The most surprising discovery was a belt of heavy gold plate, 4.5 cm. wide, covered with a design of lozenges, worked in tiny beads of different colors, threaded on gold wire. At the back is a gold plate with a slot, in which some appendage had once been attached. The front ends have semicircular terminals, from which run long wires of twisted gold for tying the ends together. At the front lay a rectangular plaque of heavy gold, inlaid with col- ored stones, giving the owner's name, Ptah- shepses, and his titles of "Pasha" and "King's Son." The sarcophagus is of a new type, and the belt is unique among the objects of jewelry in the Cairo Museum. Egyptian Art in Winthrop Bequest. -Dows DUNHAM contributes to Bull. Fogg Mus. x, pp. 40-43 (5 figs.) a brief appreciation of the Egyptian antiquities received by the Fogg Museum from this source. Most important is an Early Ptolemaic fragmentary quartz statuette of an unidentified king, a striking example of its period, and of par- ticular interest because it was never finished, and shows clearly the technique used by the sculptor. Two wooden Anubis figures are of great merit, and are dated at some period subsequent to the Empire. Of the other examples, a head of Ak- henaton is of interest, and also a portrait head of the Nineteenth Dynasty. Of the bronzes, two are selected for publication-a fine Horus hawk, dating somewhere between the Seventeenth and Twenty-fourth Dynasties, and a male figure, with a lion's head and uraeus, also presumably Horus, dating probably in the Saite period. Both are in exceptional preservation. Har-Mosi.-In BMMA. n.s. ii, 1944, pp. 159-163 (6 figs.) NORA E. SCOTT publishes the lute owned by this musician, found by the Metro- politan's Egyptian Expedition, and now in the Cairo Museum. Har-Mose was probably attached to the household of Sen-mfit, the architect of Queen Hat-shepsiit, and the instrument therefore dates about 1490 B.C. It is the earliest evidence of this instrument to be found in Egypt, and the only actual example known-our other evidence for it is in wall-paintings. A careful description of the instrument, which is in excellent preservation, is given. The writer speaks of the fondness of the Egyptians for music, although they had no system of musical notation, so that the melodies were handed down from generation to generation, just as they are today. She also lists the other instru- ments used. Of these the earliest and most popular were the harp, the flute, and the clarinet. Drums were mostly used in military bands, but the tam- bourine was common. About the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty, a number of new instru- ments appear, and it is to this period that the lute belongs. Other popular instruments to be intro- duced were the lyre and the oboe, while the trum- pet first appears at that time in military music. Tomb of Tutankhamen. - The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 80, announces the publication, by the firm of Vroment in Brussels, of a richly illustrated volume commemorating the twentieth anniver- sary of the discovery of this famous tomb, in which the most important Belgian archaeologists have collaborated. Alexandria. -In The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 71, announcement is made that during excava- tions carried out by the Greco-Roman Museum a foundation of marble stairs has been discovered, dating from the Roman period, and leading to the summit of the south slope of the Serapeum, to the point where the so-called "Pompey's Pillar" stands. These may be the stairs mentioned several times in literature of the fourth century A.D. Dur- ing the continuation of the excavations another flight of stairs, at right angles to the first, and ap- parently dating from the time of the Ptolemies, was unearthed. Of this flight, 40 steps had been uncovered up to September, 1943. This staircase may have been vaulted over. (This would appear to be somewhat of an amplification of the ac- count summarized in AJA. xlviii, 1944, p.86.-Ed.) PALESTINE The Jordan Valley.-In Bibl. Archaeologist vi, 1943, pp. 62-67, NELSO~N GLUECK summarizes</page><page sequence="7">280 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY the results of his exploration of the Jordan Valley during the winter and spring of 1942-43. While the statement in Gen. 13:10 that in the time of Lot the valley was a veritable paradise applies primarily to the southern part of the valley, Glueck found that the remark could have been applied equally well to the east side of the northern half of the valley, where there are no less than twelve peren- nial streams, and to part of the western side. Liv- ing conditions are by no means intolerable and numerous ruins point to an extensive occupation from as far back as 3500 B.C. It is now possible to identify all of the Biblical sites located on the east side of the Jordan Valley: Jabesh-gilead= Tell Abu Kharaz and Tell el-Meqbereh; Zaphon = Tell el-Qos; Zarethan= Tell es-Sa'idiyeh; Succoth= Tell Deir 'Alla; Adamah (Adam) = Tell ed-Da- mieh; Beth-nimrah= Tell Bleibil; Abel-shittim= Tell el-Hammam; Beth-haram (or Beth-haran) = Tell Iktanu; Beth-jeshimoth = Tell el-'Azeimeh. All these Biblical sites were built on easily fortified and usually isolated hills, but during the more secure Hellenistic period frequently shifted to more convenient locations in the center of broad plains, taking their names with them, a shift which has frequently led to the erroneous identi- fication of the site of the Biblical towns. Israel's Uniqueness.- The unique character of the Israelite religion is a phenomenon which has long challenged the historian for an explana- tion. A fresh discussion of the problem in the light of recent archaeological and literary investi- gation is presented by G. ERNEST WRIGHT in Bibl. Archaeologist vi, 1943, pp. 1-20. While admit- ting Israel's debt to Canaan in the fields of archi- tecture, literary forms, mythology and sacrificial ritual, and the fact that popular Yahwism differed little from Baalism, Wright emphasizes the point that official Yahwism had a unique character from the very beginning. An examination of the earliest Hebrew literary remains shows that from the very beginning Yahweh tolerated no rivals, had no mythology attached to his person, had no specialized function but was the controller and dis- poser of all things, frowned on images of himself, etc. Whether this primitive Yahwism can be called monotheistic or merely henotheistic is still debatable. But the unique character of Israelite religion antedates the prophets. Synagogues. - While the origin of the syna- gogue as an institution still remains obscure, our knowledge of the structure and decoration of the synagogues of Palestine and Syria from the sec- ond century A.D. on has been greatly increased in recent years through the progress of archaeological research. A convenient summary of this new in- formation is presented by H. G. MAY in Bibl. Archaeologist vii, 1944, pp. 1-20. The most sur- prising feature is the common employment of human, animal and bird forms in decoration in violation of the Second Commandment. In the earlier synagogues the facade faced Jerusalem; in the later ones the apse containing the Ark for the Law faced Jerusalem. The balconies reserved for women may be based on a separation of men and women in the services of the Temple. Numismatics. -A hoard of 341 bronze coins of the fourth century A.D. found in a cave near the village of Yamun in the Jenin District is published by J. BARAMKI in QDAP. xi, 1944, pp. 30-32. Most of the coins are very badly worn, but it has been possible to identify a number representing Constans I, Constantius II, Constantius Gallus, and Julian, and also two specimens with Urbs Roma and one with Constantinopolis. The same article deals with 181 Venetian and Ottoman silver coins, found near the village of Jelame near Jenin. They range in date from the accession of Suleiman the Magnificent in A.D. 1520 to the death of his grandson Murad in 1595. The Venetian coins, however, have a much shorter range, falling within the period lying between the dogeship of Andrea Gritti (1523 ff.) and that of Gerolamo Priuli (1567). The discovery of several of the so-called thick Jewish silver shekels in association with Tyrian shekels from 11/12 to 60/61 A.D. strongly supports the theory that these particular Jewish shekels should be dated to the revolt of 66-70 A.D. (MIL- LAR BURROWS in Bibl. Archaeologist vi, 1943, pp. 37-39). Gaza.-A decree of the Mamluk Sultan and Caliph al-Musta 'In Billah, which is engraved over one of the gates of the Great Mosque at Gaza, is published in full for the first time by L. A. MAYER in QDAP. xi, 1944, pp. 27-29, pl. x. The decree, dated on the eighteenth of Rabi' I, 815 A.H. (=June 28, 1412 A.D.), deals with the aboli- tion of some "illegal" taxes imposed on the inhab- itants of Gaza by Sultan Faraj, the predecessor of al-Musta 'In Billah. New Neolithic Site in Transjordan.-At Sab'a Biyar, northwest of Kilwa, an extensive cemetery has been discovered, the graves being of a type not hitherto found in Transjordan. Two main types of construction were observed: (a) large</page><page sequence="8">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 281 stone slabs set upright all around; (b) the main body of the grave of coursed blocks with large slabs set upright in the entrance. All the graves were orientated due East. Two curious features are associated with some of the graves, viz. the pres- ence of natural limestone nodules, not observed elsewhere in the vicinity, and a group of three stones beside the entrance. Flint implements found on the site are dated provisionally as Neo- lithic (Kilwian) and point to the probable date of the cemetery (A. S. KIRKBRIDE and LANKESTER HARDING in QDAP. xi, 1944, pp. 37-43, plates xI and xII. Imperial Art in Transjordan.- Evidence of the movement towards Romanization, which took place in Transjordan following the annexation of that province by Trajan in A.D. 106, is furnished by the discovery of a large cache of pottery fig- urines and lamps in a cave at Jerash. The absence of anything Semitic or Orientalizing is striking and witnesses to a widespread demand for Classi- cal types. The most interesting of the numerous lamps found are the grayish-black "metallic" ones, with one or more nozzles, clearly copied from bronze originals of the first century A.D. The presence of lamp moulds and spoiled pieces indi- cates that the lamps were made either in the cave itself or near by. Jerash must now be added to the list of lamp manufacturing centers. The figurines are largely copies or adaptations of famous Hel- lenistic works of the fourth century B.C. or later, but the treatment of the busts shows the influence of the Trajanic period. A considerable variety of Aphrodites is represented (J. H. ILIFFE in QDAP. xi, 1944, pp. 1-26, pls. I-Ix). IRAN Reliefs from Persepolis.- The Winthrop col- lection, as received by the Fogg Museum, in- cluded five reliefs from the palace of Darius (591- 485 B.C.) at Persepolis. These are described, and three of them published, by ERIC SCHROEDER in Bull. Fogg Mus. x, pp. 44-45 (3 figs.). Two repre- sent provincials in Median dress bringing offer- ings, and probably came from the stairway of Artaxerxes (359-338 B.C.); two portray heads of the so-called "Immortals," or archers of the Royal Guard, and may well date from the time of Darius himself, while the fifth is a relief of Ahura Mazda, supreme god of the Persians. The writer believes that this may well have been part of the decoration of the Hall of a Hundred Col- umns in the north part of the Persepolis platform, and if so, it is suggested that it is the missing part of the huge jamb of the south doorway. This build- ing is attributed both to Darius and to Xerxes (485-465 B.C.) and as this relief is unfinished, it may be of the time of the latter. There is a brief discussion of the tools used by the sculptors, and of the amount of time required to execute some of the details on the reliefs. Nishapur.-ILN., April 1, 1944, pp. 388-389, prints two pages of illustrations of the Metropoli- tan Museum's excavations at Nishapur in 1938- 1940. Many of these illustrations do not appear to have been published before. Shah-Nama of 1482.- HANNAH E. MCALLIS- TER publishes, in BMMA. n.s. ii, 1943, pp. 126-132 (5 figs.), two miniatures purchased by the Met- ropolitan Museum in 1940, known to come from a manuscript of the great Iranian national epic, the Shah-Nama (completed by Firdausi in 1010 A.D.) the date of which is established by a colophon as corresponding to October, 1482. The manu- script and the miniatures are described; one shows the dying Rustam killing his brother Shag- had, while the second depicts a scene not often illustrated - the vengeance of Alexander the Great on the traitorous slayers of his foe, Darius. At the time this manuscript was completed, Persia was divided between the Turkomans, who held the western part, and the descendants of Timur, who held Khurasan and the Caspian Sea prov- inces. The great figure, Shah Rukh, son of Timur, ruled until 1447, and established the splendor of the court life that persisted into the second half of the century. The peak was reached under Sul- tan Husain Mirza (1468-1506), whose court at Herat was "a magnet for great artists from all over the country," while in western Persia, at Tabriz, the Turkoman Usun Hasan (1466-1478) also established a center of literary and artistic activity. These miniatures are considered to be- long in the western tradition (School of Tabriz). Other examples, in the British Museum, the Met- ropolitan, and the Bibliothlque Nationale are illustrated, and others in various museums and collections are listed, for purposes of comparison. AEGEAN Scripts of Pre-Hellenic Greece.- In Class. Out- look xxi, pp. 72-74, ALICE E. KOBER gives a com- pact and concise account of what is known of writing in Crete and the mainland of Greece, from the results of archaeological discoveries. Al- though as yet these inscriptions cannot be de-</page><page sequence="9">282 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY ciphered, the possible clues to reach a solution are given, and a list of words is added, which appear to be derived, through Greek, from the pre-Hel- lenic language of Crete. The final statement is made that when the ancient Greeks said that "all Cretans are liars," citing as an example, among other things, their claim to the invention of the alphabet, they themselves were in error, and the Cretans were telling the truth. GREECE GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Cult of Athena Pallenis.--ROBERT SCHLAIFER discusses this ancient Attic cult in HarvSt. liv, 1943, pp. 35-67, and the laws relating to it. Our only direct source is a passage in Athenaeus (vi, 234d-235d) which it is necessary to emend in sev- eral places. It is proved that the cult is of great antiquity, going back to the seventh century B.c.; that it was administered by officials called archons, not to be confused with the rulers of the state; that these archons appointed from the adjacent demes, which were apparently a form of league, officials called parasites, whose function it was to select the victims and the barley to be offered in the festival of the goddess, and who had the right of dining from the flesh of the victims and this barley, in conjunction with the old men of the league, and women still living with their first husbands. The cult was agrarian; there is reason to believe that the goddess owned a herd of cattle, and tracts of arable land, which was put out to rent, and from which the lessees had to provide the barley for the festival. The goddess also owned treasure, deposited on the Acropolis, from which money was loaned to the State. Repairs to the temple and to the other sacred buildings were paid for from public funds, administered by the iEpv EirlcmKEvaarTai, under the direction of the King Archon, who also appointed the archons of the cult. The priest of the cult could be, and often was, a woman. In examining the laws as given in Athenaeus, much aid was obtained from inscrip- tional evidence. The article ends with an explana- tion of one of the corrupt readings, and the reason for a very radical emendation, which is followed by a good bibliography. Cyrene.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 70, quotes Mr. Henderson, Secretary of Finance in the British War Office, as having advised the House of Commons that the sites of Cyrene, Apol- lonia, and Ptolemais have not been severely dam- aged as a result of the North African campaign. The officials and custodians of the Cyrene Mu- seum have been retained in office. The Chief Di- rector of the Greek and Roman Museum at Alexandria has visited Cyrene, and will present a detailed report. Accessions by the Louvre. - The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 76, quoting from the Revue des Beaux Arts de France iv, announces that from the Henri de Nanteuil collection the Louvre has ob- tained, partly by bequest and partly on favorable conditions of purchase, a number of valuable small bronzes, principally archaic, and also a group of objects of pre-Classical, Classical, and Hellenistic Greek art, and also a few Etruscan objects. Marathon Race.-In CW. xxxvii, pp. 166-167, WALTER WOODBURN HYDE shows that this race, the great event of the modern Olympic games, was not only not a part of any Greek athletic contest, but that the actual run of Pheidippides from Marathon to Athens is unknown to either Herodotos or the elder Pliny, although both speak of his run to Sparta before the battle, to invoke aid in resisting the Persians. The only reference to the Marathon run is in Lucian. Mod- ern Marathon records are discussed, and the an- cient running races enumerated. Beating Motifs in Greek Dance.-In Class. Outlook xxi, pp. 59-61, LILLIAN B. LAWLER dis- cusses those episodes in Greek dancing where one performer beats another with a stick, the Ar'hov -rrapCXTrlyis. Very little is known or even conjec- tured about what this motif consisted of. The writer examines the literary and archaeological evidence and finds opportunities for such action, among ex- tant Greek plays, in the Suppliants and Eumenides of Aeschylus, the Oedipus Coloneus and Ajax of Sophocles, and the Herakleidae, Iphigeneia in Aulis, and Rhesus of Euripides; but the motif was appar- ently more frequent in the satyr plays, as in the Cy- clops of Euripides, and the Ichneutae of Sophocles there are frequent hints of the beating motif. The contemporary vase-paintings bear this out, as they often represent Satyrs and Maenads swinging their thyrsi against each other. As would be ex- pected, this motif is common in Old Comedy, nearly all of the extant plays of Aristophanes having references to beatings. There is also evi- dence that, through the development of comedy, this motif persisted as late as the time of Justin- ian. Beating and fighting dances were by no means uncommon in the classical period under other names, and peoples in all parts of the world have</page><page sequence="10">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 283 used ceremonial beatings to induce fertility or to ward off evil. Instances of this form of beating are given in Pausanias, and are of early origin, as is proved by an early black-figured vase in the Brit- ish Museum (B 80) showing two men ritually and rhythmically beating each other with clubs. The ceremonial beating in the ritual of Artemis Orthia at Sparta is discussed, as well as an earlier rite in the same cult-the ceremonial punishment of thefts of food from sacred spots. This was re- garded in later times as a dance motif, and it appears on early vases - one in the Louvre and one in the British Museum are cited. This theft motif, too, is often found in the Old Comedy. The con- clusion is reached that the origin of the beating motifs was from two prinmitive concepts - apotro- paic and ritual theft. Plea for Pausanias. - DAVID M. ROBINSON con- tributes a note to CW. xxxvii, pp. 165-166, in which he takes issue with the statements of John Day and others, who claim that Herodes Atticus "exhausted" the quarries on Mt. Pentelikon. He asserts that a correct reading of the passage of Pausanias involved (i, 19, 6) shows that Herodes had certain quarries and that these quarries were largely exhausted, but the fact that marble is still quarried on the mountain shows that all the sources were not exhausted. Ancient Gremlin. - HENRY C. MONTGOMERY contributes a note to Class. Outlook (xxi, p. 68) to show that the mythical occupant of the mound at Olympia called Taraxippos, was often conceived in art as a dwarf-like, surly demon, mounted behind a horseman or charioteer. He is not con- fined to Olympia, but is also found at Corinth and Nemea. "Obviously he was something very like the Gremlin of today, who annoys the modern flying chariot and its driver." ARCHITECTURE The Propylaea.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 64, announces that Professor ORLANDOS, Director of the Reconstruction Office of the present Min- istry of Public Education at Athens, will under- take the restoration of the Propylaea. SCULPTURE The Greek Kouros.- GEORGE W. ELDERKIN contributes a note on this subject to Art in Amer- ica xxxi, 1943, pp. 153-154, taking Miss Richter's recent book as his point of departure. He dis- putes the dependence of early Greek art on that of Egypt, pointing out that of all the statues and statuettes listed by Miss Richter, only four come from the mainland of Asia Minor. "The fact is that the kouros was at home in Greece, and not along the eastern littoral of the Mediterranean." The kouroi listed as from Naucratis he believes were importations from Samos or Aegina, as both places had temples at Naucratis-and these may have been of Argive inspiration indirectly. The Ionians, who can be shown to have had the Orien- tal aversion to the nude in art, could not be the intermediaries in transmitting the kouros from Egypt to Greece. The Metropolitan kouros is the only example in sculpture with a neckband in re- lief, and is further unique in having it tied in front - examples in vase-paintings always have the neckband tied in the back. Other interesting fea- tures, not mentioned in Miss Richter's book are also described, including a kouros at Delphi wear- ing an Etruscan bulla, perhaps from the Treasury of Caere. Greek Sculpture in Cleveland. -In Art in America xxxi, 1943, pp. 113-126 (19 figs.) MAR- GARETE BIEBER calls attention to the excellent specimens of Greek sculpture in the Cleveland Museum of Art. A head of a sphinx is an outstand- ing example of the archaic art of the mid-sixth century B.C. It was found at Soluntum on the north coast of Sicily, and shows Ionic influence. At about the turn of this century (ca. 500 B.C.) belongs a life-size head of a goat, of poros lime- stone, said to have been found on a slope of the Acropolis at Athens ("the only large piece of Attic poros limestone sculpture in this coun- try"). A bronze figure of a bull, dated about 480 B.C., is undoubtedly of Magna Graecia workman- ship, perhaps from Thurii. Next is published a female head of Parian marble, formerly in the Stroganoff collection, a Roman copy of an original of ca. 460 B.C., of the Argive school. Published as a piece of sculpture is a bronze statuette of a youth, originally a mirror-stand, which the writer be- lieves to have been identified with the Greek colony of Locris in Southern Italy. It dates in 480-460 B.C. A life-size statue of an athlete, a Roman copy in Carrara marble of a bronze origi- nal, can be attributed to "the master of the Omphalos Apollo" and is placed about 450 B.C. Of the second half of the fifth century, Cleve- land possesses no examples, but Dr. Bieber pub- lishes a beautiful female head in Buffalo, which she attributes to Alkamenes, to fill in this gap. In good fourth-century work Cleveland is very rich. First, two Attic grave monuments are pub-</page><page sequence="11">284 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY lished, one (fragmentary) of a woman, of the He- geso type, the other a marble lekythos. In con- trast to the repose of these Attic monuments, one from Tarentum is shown, with reliefs of figures in violent pose. Of the school of Praxiteles there is a much damaged torso of the "Hermes of Andros" type. A head of Aphrodite of the Capitoline type is a Hadrianic copy of an early Hellenistic origi- nal. One of the finest pieces in the collection is a portrait head of Alexander the Great, found in Alexandria, dating in the third century B.C. Of this Alexandrian school there are also two delightful heads of girls. From Tarentum comes probably a terracotta figurine of a woman, with a head similar to these, and the hair similarly dressed, dating probably in the second century. A head of a Per- sian, said to come from Alexandria, bears some resemblance to some of the Pergamene reliefs, but Dr. Bieber considers it Alexandrian of the second century, citing a head in the Cairo Museum as a parallel. Finally, a bronze mirror-case with a youth and maiden in high relief, dating in the sec- ond century and recalling Pergamene art, and a bronze statuette of Apollo, a century later, and typifying the eclectic art of the early Roman age, are published. Two Statuettes. - In Art in America xxxii, 1944, pp. 19-25 (5 figs.) VALENTINE MULLER publishes two bronze statuettes in the Walker Gallery at Bowdoin College. One represents a male figure reclining on a couch, and is dated in the early sixth century (580-570) B.C. The custom of reclining at meals appears to have been intro- duced into Greek lands from the Orient, and the statuette is believed to have been made in Eastern Greece, perhaps in Miletus or Ephesus. The sec- ond statuette is of a standing youth, holding an object on his left shoulder with both hands. The garment which he wears is without analogies in Greece, and is of Egyptian type. The youth is therefore identified as a priest of Isis, and the object he carried was the pole of a litter, the cor- responding pole to be held by another figure, to support a cult image. A date early in the Hel- lenistic period, the last third of the third century B.C., is suggested. Female Torso in Louvre. - The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 75, quoting from the Revue des Beaux Arts de France iv, reports on a female torso ac- quired by the Louvre in 1939. It is obviously of the type of the Esquiline Venus in the Conserva- tori Palace in Rome, and while not as well pre- served, is far superior to it in excellence of work- manship. It confirms the generally accepted opinion that both it and the Esquiline sculpture are copies of a Greek original of about 460 B.C. The suggestion is made that the original was not a Venus, but probably an Atalanta, or some other female athlete. Foot of Sarapis.-The discovery of a foot of Sarapis in Athens, the first and only example known there, and the largest to be found any- where, has led STERLING Dow and FRIEDA S. UPSON to collect in Hesperia xiii, 1944, pp. 58-77, the evidence on this curious type of monument, the grotesque, snake-entwined, bust-crowned foot of Sarapis. Only five examples are recorded. Such feet must have been fairly common, as coins testify, but examples in marble large enough to bear as well some sculptured representation of the god were never numerous. All are right feet, all are large, either slightly larger than nature, or twice as large as nature. Four feet are sandalled, one is not. Three feet are surmounted by busts of Sarapis, one by a copy of Bryaxis' whole figure. The Bryaxis type was followed in the heads gen- erally. Harpocrates appears in relief on the sandal, with his finger to his lips, and a cornucopia on the left arm. Apart from the one foot without a san- dal, all have one or two serpents of the cobra spe- cies. The finest example, no. 1 in the discussion, now in Alexandria, is almost certainly Antonine, and the others may well be of that period. Ancient Metal Reliefs.- DOROTHY KENT HILL corrects in Hesperia xiii, 1944, pp. 87-89, a mis- take made in her earlier article on ancient metal reliefs (Hesperia xii, 1943, p. 97), where she at- tributed to Miss Richter and Miss Milne the dis- covery "that the repouss' technique was invented by Pheidias and Polykleitos in the fifth century B.C.," a view which in reality was her own. Actu- ally the technique of the matrix and hammering, found on the silver bowl in the Metropolitan Mu- seum, was so influenced by the all important new technique of the age of Pheidias and Polykleitos, namely repouss6 (as Pliny suggests), that the names of the great artists must be linked with it. The improvement must have been made in the new medium of repouss6 and then applied to the older technique of the matrix to give more plastic form and differentiated planes. Bronze Statuettes from Egypt.-Under this title, DOROTHY KENT HILL, in Art in America xxxi, 1943, pp. 182-194 (6 figs.), publishes a group of bronze statuettes in the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore. These statuettes she considers were the</page><page sequence="12">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 285 product of "methods of mass production" and were made in moulds. The evidence for this is dis- cussed at some length. First to be considered is a group of a pair of twin gods, presumably Castor and Pollux, said to have been found at Abu Homma, Lower Egypt, and called by the writer "the ug- liest object in the Walters Art Gallery." The heads are so made that the wax models could be pulled out of the mould without destroying it, and the suggestion is made that the different parts were made in partial moulds, just as if they were terracotta, and then cast by the cire-perdue proc- ess. A group of two women, purchased in Cairo in 1929, also seems to have been made in the same way. A group of pancratiasts, also from Egypt, is of a type often found; the evidence of the heads shows that moulds were used. A statuette of Zeus, also bought in Cairo, has an elderly head attached to a youthful body, and hands out of proportion to the size of the figure, suggesting that the crafts- man, in carrying out his commission, picked three moulds, none of which corresponded to the others. The un-Greek character of these statuettes is also stressed- although they are unquestionably gen- uine, they are not the sort of thing a Museum would normally purchase. An Aphrodite, also bought in Cairo, illustrates this un-Greek type of workmanship. Although the pose is Classical, the fleshy, realistic body is not. Finally, a small bronze athlete, of uncertain provenance, the authentieity of which has been suspected, is now believed by the writer to belong to this Egyptian school. VASES Groups of Early Black-Figure. -In an article dedicated to the memory of Michael Vlasto, J. D. BEAZLEY classifies groups of early Attic black- figure vases in Hesperia xiii, 1944, pp. 38-57. The period may be thought of as beginning with the establishment of the full black-figure technique in Attica, and ending with the creation, early in the second quarter of the sixth century, of a new and subtle style by Ergotimos and Kleitias and their companions. In the earlier part of the period Attic vases were not much exported, and the material has been largely increased by recent excavations in the Agora, in the Ceramicus, and at Vari. In Beazley's opinion the Nessos Painter is the earliest Attic black-figure artist whose personality is clear. Beginning with the Nessos Painter Beazley assigns vases of this period to the following artists: the Painter of the Aegina Chimaeras, the Gorgon Painter, the Painter of A. M. 69, the Ceramicus Painter, the Anagyrus Painter, the Painter of Ber- lin 1659, the Painter of Eleusis 767, the Painter of the Dresden Lekane, the Komast Group, Sophilos, the Polos Painter, the Swan Group. Vases in each group and those related to each group are care- fully described. INSCRIPTIONS Athenian Decree Concerning Tribute.--B. H. HILL and B. D. MERITT analyze in Hesperia xiii, 1944, pp. 1-15, an early Athenian decree, which may be restored from a fragment of a fifth century Attic inscription found by Gorham P. Stevens in 1938 in the south jamb of the east door- way of the Parthenon and three other pieces of the same inscription recently published as D 7 by Meritt, Wade-Gery, and McGregor in the first volume of The Athenian Tribute Lists. The stone measures 0.82 m. high, 0.20 m. wide, and 0.148 m. thick. The decree makes provision for getting tribute to Athens normally before the Dionysiac festival. Immediately after the festival a report is to be made to the Athenians by the Hellenotamiai and four men are to be sent out to the cities of the empire to give receipts for tribute paid, and to try to collect what is still due. At the beginning of the new year there will still be prosecutions for arrears, and during the new year current tribute and back payments are to be expected. These conditions seem best met in the tribute lists by the records of 448/7, when there was a general desire on the part of the allies to forego their payments after the Peace of Kallias in 449. New Attic Mortgage Inscription. -D. M. ROB- INSON publishes a new Attic mortgage inscription in Hesperia xiii, 1944, pp. 16-21. It was acquired by Robinson from a dealer years ago, and sup- posedly was found in Marousi, northeast of Athens, probably near where IG. ii2, 2670, was unearthed. It is of the small marker or horos type, an irregular fragment of blue Hymettian marble, blackened as though it had come through a fire. The most important contribution of the inscrip- tion is the mention of two important Athmoneans concerned in the mortgage. They are Philokte- mon, father of the more famous Athmonean who was lTIlaeh'riljS TCv vEcpilv in 334/3 B.C., and Theokles, a banker, perhaps mentioned in De- mosthenes' oration for Apollodoros against Nik- ostratos. The inscription must date on epigraph- ical grounds between 350-325 B.c. 'Er~vlKToS.--PAUL MAAs discusses the text of a tablet of the fourth century B.c., coming from</page><page sequence="13">286 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Phalasarna in western Crete (no. 9355, National Museum, Athens) in Hesperia xiii, 1944, pp. 36-37. In this charm tablet different kinds of nonsense appear, the 'EqPEaia ypapparTa, other barbaric groups of letters, Greek words and phrases in no intelligible context, Greek words more or less cor- rupt. The word t-rwVlKTo5 occurring in the inscrip- tion characterizes a remedy administered to the skin by being applied, as opposed to being rubbed in. Proxeny Decree from Ios.- ROBERT SCHLAIFER publishes with photograph in Hesperia xiii, 1944, p. 22, a fragment of a proxeny decree in los, purchased by C. H. Morgan in los in 1936. It is now in the library of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, and may be dated in the third-second century B.C. Inscriptions from Beroea.-J. M. R. COR- MACK discusses in Hesperia xiii, 1944, pp. 23-29, a group of ancient marbles which came to light in the autumn of 1936 in the course of excavations made during tree-planting. The remains consist of marble grave monuments, architectural blocks, pieces of tufa columns, still bearing traces of Roman plaster. The workmen had uncovered part of the circuit wall of Beroea, built in all probability in the third century after Christ, a date supported by the lettering of the inscriptions. Nine inscribed grave monuments are published, the most interesting of which contains an elegiac epigram that throws light on the theatrical pro- fession in Imperial times, since it is the first epi- graphic evidence for the presentation of mimes in Macedonia. Obscure Inscription on Gold Tablet.-CAMP- BELL BONNER in Hesperia xiii, 1944, pp. 30-35, describes an obscure inscription engraved on a thin plate of gold, found in 1852 in the mouth of a skull, which was enclosed in a terracotta urn at the Vigna Codini near the tomb of the Scipios. The inscription perhaps can best be explained as be- longing to an amulet against a danger well known to most Mediterranean peoples, namely the sting of scorpions or bite of snakes. This danger was especially familiar in Egypt, the home of the Sarapis cult, mentioned in the inscription. As the amulet was valuable in life, so it was buried with the dead. ROME GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Poggio Buco.-HarvSt. liv, 1943, pp. 117-119, prints an abstract of a doctoral dissertation by GIACINTO MATTEUCIG on this site, which was the necropolis of Statonia, and is situated twenty-five miles northeast of Vulci. The first systematic excavations were by Mancinelli in 1896-97; of the material found, part is in the Archaeological Museum in Florence, part in Berlin, the contents of one tomb in the University Museum in Phila- delphia, while the bulk, namely the contents of seven tombs, is at the University of California. It is this last material that is the subject of the dissertation. The vases, numbering 300, form a very representative series, ranging from Impasto to Italo-Corinthian. From this pottery the cultural history of the site may be determined. The archaic period (700-550 B.c.) may be divided into three phases-(1) Early, with trench tombs and Impasto and Italo-Geometric wares; (2) Early Orientaliz- ing, with the tombs still trench, but with Proto- Corinthian and Geometric importations and imi- tations; (3) Ripe Orientalizing, with more elab- orate tombs, and Bucchero and Corinthian vases and Italic imitations. These finds prove the close connection and dependence of Statonia on Vulci. Its geographical position made it an important station for the defense of Vulci. The town was fortified with a citadel and a wall with an esti- mated perimeter of 3 km. Fine terracotta revet- ments from its temple suggest its importance in the district. With the beginning of late Proto- Corinthian ware, commercial relations with Greece become increasingly important. Peculiar to Sta- tonia is a very fine impasto technique with geo- metric decorations, which were probably ex- ported through Etruria, at least as far as Chiusi. After the second half of the sixth century, the place, for some reason as yet unknown, suffered a severe decline, and almost entirely faded out of the picture. Rome. -Announcement is made by The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 57, that the Vatican Museums are still accessible, except during the month of August, when they are always closed. No precau- tionary measures have been taken against air raids-on the contrary, precious books and ob- jects of art from Rome, and especially from Ro- man churches, have been deposited in the extra- territorial buildings of Vatican City. In ibid., p. 89, a report is quoted from German sources that an agreement has been reached between the Ger- man occupation authorities and the Vatican that all works of art, manuscripts and the like owned by the Holy See shall be collected by the Germans and handed over to the Vatican. Furthermore, the</page><page sequence="14">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 287 Vatican intends to set up a permanent commission charged with the registration of all the damage caused to churches and church property through- out Europe, this body to be composed of high ecclesiastics. In conrection with these reports, further announcement is made in ibid., p. 92, that a number of precious works of art have been brought to Rome, especially from Frosinone and Monte Cassino, and that Professor Evers of Munich has been entrusted with the direction of the protection of works of art in the parts of Italy occupied by the Germans. Bombing of Rome.- The Tablet (London) for March 11, 1944, translates parts of articles from the Osservatore Romano, regarding damage done to Church property, and in Vatican City, during the air raids on Rome. The results, while re- grettable, are, on the whole, not such as cannot be repaired, and consist largely of a number of broken windows, particularly in the Palace of the Holy Office, St. Peter's Oratory, and San Paolo Fuori Le Mura. Protests by the Vatican authori- ties have been transmitted by the Vatican radio. Poster Politics in Ancient Rome.-E. H. BREW- STER, in CJ. xxxix, pp. 466-483, discusses the use of public places for political announcements in Rome, largely in the period of the Empire. Beginning with the Senatusconsultum de Bacchan- alibus which, inscribed on bronze tablets, was posted throughout Roman territory in Republican times, she follows with comments on the Res Gestae Divi Augusti, as preserved at Ancyra and Pisidian Antioch, the Lyons tablet of Claudius, and the Lex Imperio Vespasiani. She then devotes some space to the political and other inscriptions scratched or painted on the walls of Pompeian buildings, and in conclusion compares this prac- tice of the Romans of poster politics with similar examples in modern Italy, of which she cites a number of specimens. Exile under Roman Emperors. - This subject is discussed by MARY V. BRAGINTON in CJ. xxxix, pp. 391-407. An attempt is made to treat the subject from the point of view of the person exiled. The period covered is that from Augustus to Trajan. The number of exiles whose names are known is not large, and is confined to persons of wealth or influence. Exile was most frequent dur- ing the reigns of Tiberius, Nero, and Domitian. Of the forty-six known to be exiled by Nero, about one-half were political cases. The mildest form was relegation from Rome, or from Rome and Italy, when the exile could choose his own residence. This could be for a term of years, or for life, and property rights were not affected. Severer forms were (a) relegation to a designated place, usually an island, with full property rights; (b) exile to an undesignated place, with loss of citizenship and property; and (c) deportation to an island for life. It is not clear whether these latter deportees were guarded or not. Exiles could receive an allowance for their support from their families, or, when their property was confiscated, the State could allocate an annual income to them from it. Many worked for their living in menial tasks, or continued to practice their regular pro- fessions. In some cases their families went with them into exile. We hear of colonies of exiles at Seriphos, Corsica, and Sardinia, and occasionally of exiles who identified themselves with their new homes and communities. The examples we know best are, of course, Ovid and Seneca. On the accession of a new Emperor he often recalled from banishment those who had been exiled by his predecessor-this is especially true of Caligula, Claudius and, to a lesser extent, Nero. With Nerva and Trajan a new era began. The conclu- sion is reached that Roman exiles had certain ad- vantages over the refugees of today, particularly in the milder cases. Pompeii. - The New Pallas vii, 1943, pp. 69, 84, gives a list of the damage done at Pompeii. The museum was hit, and, according to a statement by AMEDEO MAIURI, a great and valuable part of its contents was destroyed, although it is said that the most valuable objects had been removed. The Macellum, the Temple of Vespasian, the Building of Eumachia and the Lares altar are reported to have been destroyed, to which Maiuri adds the Temple of Jupiter and the portico near the House of Triptoleinos, which have suffered much damage. Damage in Sicily.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 84, summarizes the reports from Sicily, up to November, 1943. In Palermo, the most important monuments are intact, or only slightly damaged. Among the buildings saved are the Cathedral, the church of S. Giovanni degli Eremiti, and the Royal Palace with the Palatine Chapel. The Quattro Canti have been injured, but can be easily restored. The mosaics of Monreale are in- tact. The temples of Segesta and Agrigento are unhurt, but some other remains at Agrigento have suffered injury. The theater at Segesta, and the classical ruins and Cathedral at Syracuse are intact or only slightly damaged.</page><page sequence="15">288 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Urbino.--The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 64, reports that during building operations in the oldest part of the town, the ruins of a Roman theater, hitherto quite unknown, have been dis- covered. Distinct traces of the cavea, built in the Hellenistic manner, and leaning against the hill, with three travertine flights of steps, have been found, as well as fragments of marble columns and other marble building parts, and part of the pavement. Padua.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 53, reports that during excavations in the Piazza 9 Maggio, a section of the Roman road leading to Porta San Lorenzo, where there was a gate in the Roman period, has been unearthed. At the Piazza dei Signori remains of mediaeval walls have been brought to light. Sopron, West Hungary.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, reports several items of interest from this locality. At Fertoerakos, near this place, a sanc- tuary of Mithras, discovered in a cave in 1866, will be preserved and restored, by order of the Bishop of Gytr. A large relief, which has been much damaged, is to be provisionally preserved, while a smaller relief, three votive stelae, and various other objects will be brought back to the sanctuary from the Sopron Museum (p. 52). At Sopron-Banfalva, 20 new tombs, in addition to 33 previously uncovered, have been found, dating from the Arpad period. Many contained minor objects (p. 64). SCULPTURE Roman Sculpture in Cleveland. - In Art in America xxxii, 1944, pp. 65-83 (13 figs.), MAR- GARETE BIEBER continues her studies of ancient sculpture in the Cleveland Museum (see ibid. xxxi, 1943, pp. 113-126). A brief discussion of the un- derlying principles of Roman art is followed by illustrations from the Museum's collection. The writer begins with a Neo-Attic relief of Apollo and Nike, dated in the first century B.C., made by a Greek artist from Pentelic marble, and said to have been found in the theater at Capua, one of five representations of this group known. Another Neo-Attic relief, said to have been found in Corfu, and also of Pentelic marble, shows Hermes and Athena. A group of portrait heads is then dis- cussed, as well as a portrait statue of a statesman in a toga, dated in the Flavian period. Two fe- male heads are identified as Octavia, wife of Nero, and the empress Lucilla (165-169 A.D.). Of the period of Hadrian there is a torso of Apollo, which betrays the return to Greek types, and a small portrait head of the emperor, done before Greek influence became pre-eminent. An ash-urn of the Flavian period, and a splendid sarcophagus of the Hadrianic age are described and illustrated as excellent examples of their types. The latest object in the group is a portrait head in black basalt, probably of a priest of Isis, and dated at the end of the second century A.D. Ostia.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 53, an- nounces the discovery recently of a statue of Mithras in the course of the current excavations, dating from the time of Trajan, and bearing the signature of Kriton of Athens. POTTERY Workshop of Perennius. - CHRISTINE ALEX- ANDER, in BMMA. n.s. ii, 1944, pp. 166-172 (10 figs.), gives a concise and clear resume of the history of Arretine pottery, particularly of its most famous manufacturer, Marcus Perennius Tigranus, who flourished from about 31 B.C. until about 10 A.D. It is supposed that he died about that time, when the concern was taken over by his heir, M. Perennius Bargathes, whose activities ceased during the reign of Tiberius. Shortly after that, Arretine wares degenerated, and the center of activity shifted to Gaul. The best Arretine ware is of the early period, when the signatures of slaves, whose names are almost invariably Greek, appear in conjunction with those of the proprietor. Of the slaves of Perennius, the most famous, per- haps, are Cerdo and Nicephorus. The process of manufacture of the ware is carefully described, and is illustrated by photographs of stamps and molds in the collection of the Metropolitan Mu- seum, which is one of the largest in existence. It is hinted that these craftsmen were greatly in- fluenced by relief designs on silverware, and that the decay of terra sigillata may have been due to the invention of the blowing tube, making glass cheaper for table use. ROMAN BRITAIN Canterbury.-As a result of the air bombard- ment, according to The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 81, comprehensive excavations are being under- taken, with the object of finding remains of the Roman and mediaeval periods, before rebuilding the houses destroyed. Roman Roads.--In AJ. xxiii, 1943, p. 157, I. D. MARGARY gives additional evidence that the drainage ditches on main roads in England were</page><page sequence="16">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 289 84 feet apart and on secondary roads 63 feet apart. Grain-Drying Ovens.-In AJ. xxiii, 1943, pp. 148-153, R. G. GOODCH1LD lists 13 examples of T-shaped corn-drying ovens, found on British sites. Particular attention is given to a well pre- served oven at Atworth, Wilts., with its evidence that the furnace was covered by two stone floors. The grain was placed on the upper floor, which was heated by the smoke and gases which passed between the floors. All these T-shaped ovens seem to belong to the fourth century A.D., or later. Verulamium.-In AJ. xxiii, 1943, p. 148, PHILIP CORDER reports on the discovery of a quern stone of Rhineland lava, the upper surface of which is decorated in low relief. This is, ap- parently, the first decorated quern. EARLY CHRISTIAN AND BYZANTINE Earliest Christian Books.-In early Christian times it was still the fashion to publish works with literary pretensions on rolls of papyrus. Re- cent discoveries of very early New Testament manuscripts have shown, however, that the early Christians had a marked preference for the codex or leaf book of parchment or papyrus, which was used more for commercial and other utilitarian purposes. This shows how greatly the Christians were dominated by practical considerations and how little they were influenced by literary con- servatism. The employment of the leaf book helps to explain the loss of the ending of Mark's Gospel, Luke's omission of Mark 6:44-8:96, the apparent dislocations which spoil the connections in John's Gospel, and the strange combination of three letters of Paul in ii Corinthians (C.C. McCowN in Bibl. Archaeologist vi, 1943, pp. 21-31). Christian Art, Scotland.-In GBA. ser. vi, xxiv, 1943, pp. 257-272 (13 figs.), CECIL L. CURLE and FRANQOISE HENRY give an outline of pre- Romanesque art in Scotland from the fifth to the eleventh centuries. The chief relics are carvings in stone. There are no important architectural remains. It is possible that some good illumina- tion was done, but in this respect the influence of Ireland was very strong. No intelligible in- scriptions exist. The history of Scotland during this period is little known. At its beginning it was inhabited by the Picts, but about A.D. 500, the Scots, who came from Ireland, migrated and ob- tained a foothold. From that time intermittent fighting went on, but in the eighth century the Picts gained supremacy, to lose it to the Scots in 843, when the united kingdom was established. Attempts had been made in the fourth century to convert the Picts to Christianity, without suc- cess. In 565, St. Columba founded the monastery of Iona, the influence of which spread all over Pictish Scotland. There were also missions from the South of England, which for a time were superior in influence to those from Ireland. The Vikings, while they sacked Iona and other mon- asteries, made no permanent settlements in east or south Scotland. To the period of Pictish su- premacy belong a series of engraved boulders and pillars, decorated with symbolic designs, many of which are illustrated. The most surprising achieve- ment of these designs is the rendering of animal forms, which are of real excellence. They go back as early as the sixth century. Later, an Irish artistic infiltration spread from the West over the whole of Scotland. This is shown particularly in metal work, the Scottish character of which is attested by the lavish use of silver, which the Irish very rarely employed. A striking example is the Monymusk reliquary in the Edinburgh Mu- seum, which is of Irish type, but is covered with plates of silver, decorated with medallions of enamel. It is traditionally associated with St. Columba, but probably should be dated not ear- lier than the end of the seventh or beginning of the eighth century. Carved slabs of this period found in Scotland, in contrast to the earlier Pictish monuments, become highly religious in character. Conspicuous is the cross-slab Meigle in Perthshire, with representations on its reverse side of Daniel in the lions' den, and of David tending his flocks. On the other hand, the cross-slab at Golspie in Sutherlandshire has Pictish symbols on its re- verse. The carvings of St. Andrews, consisting of panels forming a sarcophagus, which probably date between 731 and 761, are in many ways quite different from what preceded them. They repre- sent David under varying aspects, and show Oriental influence. Similar influence appears in the cross-slab at Nigg in Ross-shire, where the Oriental effect is even more marked. Another ex- ample is St. Martin's Cross at Iona. In the last two centuries of this period, the Oriental influence disappears, and stone-carving returns to a more simplified technique: Examples are a stone arch near Forteviot, and a cross at Dupplin in Perth- shire, decorated with figures of David. The in- spiration here appears to be English. Thus, before the Romanesque period, influence on Scotland</page><page sequence="17">290 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY came first from Ireland, from which Oriental patterns came in, and finally, after the Viking raids, from England. Pulborough, Sussex.-In AJ. xxiii, 1943, pp. 155-157, E. C. CURWEN reports the discovery of a large lead vessel or cistern with a capacity of about 46 gallons. This is the seventh similar cistern to be found in England, and the second with the Chi-Rho monogram. The purpose and function of these cisterns is still undetermined. Comnenian Portraits. - ERNEST DEWALD iden- tifies in Hesperia xiii, 1944, pp. 78-86, the im- perial portraits in the miniature on the recto of the first folio of the Vatican Psalter (Barb. Gr. 379). The miniature is full page, the upper half of which shows Christ as Pantocrator enthroned in a half-mandorla. Below are three royal per- sonages, a bearded emperor, a young beardless prince, and an empress, wearing their crowns and their ceremonial costumes, and standing on low cushioned platforms. The young prince is receiving special attention from heaven, for an angel touching his crown is flying down towards him directly from the throne of Christ. The miniature seems to represent not only the glorification of an imperial family, but also to emphasize the coro- nation ceremony, and particularly the ceremony in which the young prince is being associated with his father as co-emperor. This is clear from the central position of the prince, his stemma crown (worn only by imperial personages), his regalia, and the special attention he is receiving from the angel. An approximate date for the Barberini Psalter can be reached on the basis of the style of the iconography as well as of the palaeography, i.e. in the latter quarter of the eleventh or even in the early twelfth century. Jerphanion first sug- gested that the miniature might represent Alexius I Comnenus, his wife, Empress Irene, and their young son, John, crowned in 1092 at the age of four. This same conclusion Dewald reached in- dependently on the basis of a careful examination of the history of the period, of two coins and a seal struck at the time of the coronation, and of other portraits of Alexius and Irene which exist. Furthermore, the word EiprljVlK in the inscription on the miniature occurs immediately beside and above the empress. The emperor and his son both wear semi-spherical crowns, a type introduced by the Comnenes and having a special use, as they were an essential feature of imperial dress. The young prince holds not the usual mappa or globe in his left hand, but a book with jewel-studded covers, perhaps this psalter presented on the occa- sion of his coronation. Excavations at Istanbul. - The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 71, reports that during demolition work near the Hippodrome, in 1939, Byzantine stone work with remains of frescoes had been discovered, and proved to be part of the Martyrion of St. Euphemia. From August to December 19492, systematic excavations were undertaken by A. N. SCHNEIDER and RUDOLPH NAUMANN of the Ger- man Archaeological Institute, laying bare the entire building, and uncovering more frescoes. According to Naumann's report (in Forschungen und Fortschritte of July 90 and August 1, 1943) the building was probably erected at the beginning of the fifth century as a Nymphaeum or bath, and at the beginning of the seventh century was rebuilt for its later object. The frescoes date between the end of the eighth and the end of the tenth centuries, and are of historical importance; they represent the life of St. Euphemia. Of four- teen large paintings, eight are nearly intact, the others severely damaged. Remains of other rep- resentations of saints have been found, dating from the eleventh to the fourteenth centuries. MEDIAEVAL Amsterdam.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 72, announces the acquisition by the Rijksmuseum of an extremely rare Carolingian chandelier, .34 m. in height. Muenchen-Gladbach. -During recent air raids the Minster (begun in 979) has been seriously damaged by bombs, and the Town Hall, formerly the abbey, dating in 1663, has collapsed (The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 74). Kolding, East Jutland.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, pp. 71, 73, announces that in the Kolding fiord a huge rudder was recently found, belonging to an early ship. Divers were sent down, and the ship was located lying in a morass, 400 to 500 m. distant from land. She was completely over- turned, had an overall length of ca. 24 m., and was the largest of her kind to be found in Denmark. A closer examination of her hull reveals that she is not a Viking ship, as was at first supposed, but a merchant ship, of a date in the eleventh century A.D., the first merchantman of this epoch to be found in these waters. It is proposed to raise her, under the auspices of the National Museum, but it will not be done till after the war. The rudder, in the meantime, has been temporarily resunk in the morass for preservation.</page><page sequence="18">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 291 Oorschot.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 61, reports that the Boterkerkeje, one of the earliest stone churches in Holland, is to be restored. Its west front, which is still in perfect preservation, is a unique example of Dutch eleventh-century ecclesiastical architecture. Sopron-Banfalva.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 63, gives a brief account of researches carried out by ARPXD BOTTYXN, under the auspices of the Count Teleki Scientific Institute and the Hun- garian National Museum, in the crypt of the Chapel of St. Mary Magdalen near this place. It has been established that it was built in the Romanesque style in the eleventh or twelfth cen- tury. Important mediaeval frescoes were discov- ered, one of which represents the Adoration of the Magi. It is believed that they were painted by Johannes Aquila, who decorated several Hun- garian churches about 1 400. Muenster, Westphalia.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 80, gives a list of buildings damaged or destroyed during recent air raids. Most of the old houses in the town are said to have been de- stroyed, and the Cathedral (1165-1265), the Gothic Lamberti church, the Museum and the University are said to have been gravely damaged, together with other more modern buildings. Tournai.--In The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 91, an account is given of a very remarkable discovery in the Cathedral. The walls of a chapel in the south aisle proved to be entirely decorated with mural paintings, dating in the twelfth century, which had been covered with plaster. The most impressive and best preserved is a Crucifixion. The principal colors employed in these paintings are red and green. This discovery adds to, and supplements, those recently made in the Churches of Saint-Brice and Saint-Quentin of similar murals. Klosterneuburg. - Announcement is made in The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 88, that the restoration of part of the Augustinian convent has been finished. Part of the art treasures were exhibited before being put in a place of safety, especially the Verdun altar and architectural fragments of the Romanesque church, dating in the twelfth century, as well as panels of the fifteenth century. While in a place of safety, some of these objects are to be restored. Moldauthein, Bohemia.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 87, reports that in the cemetery church at Albrechtitz, near this place, frescoes, said to date in the twelfth century, have been discovered, and steps taken to insure their preservation. Bologna.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 60, gives the information that in the air raid of July 24, 1943, the facade and other parts of the early Gothic church of San Francesco were damaged. In the Piazza Galileo, the Gothic sepulchre of Rolandino Passegeri (1300-1305) was hit. Aix-la-Chapelle. -According to German infor- mation, the fourteenth century spires of the Rathaus were destroyed in recent air raids and the roof fell in. The coronation hall has suffered great injury. In the cathedral the Pfalzkapelle has been damaged (The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 56). Verona.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 61, reports that during restoration work in the crypt of San Zeno, a fresco, probably dating in the be- ginning of the fifteenth century, was discovered in the second lunette of the enclosing wall near the altar of Sts. Cosmas and Damianus. The painting is in a good state of preservation, and represents the Mass of St. Martin, showing the saint elevat- ing the host. Later, a second fresco, depicting the Healing of the Sick, was found. Restorations are contemplated. Painting by Joos van Gent.-In BMMA. n.s. ii, 1943, pp. 133-139 (3 figs. and cover illustration) HARRY B. WEHLE publishes a painting by this artist, acquired by the Metropolitan in 1941 from the Blumenthal bequest. The subject is the Adora- tion of the Magi. He begins with an exposition of the importance of Ghent in the mediaeval Netherlands, only rivalled by Bruges. Joos van Gent (van Wassenhove) was admitted to the Guild of St. Luke in 1464. In 1475 we hear of him as in Rome, but we do not know when he left Ghent, and his activities between 1468 and early 1473 are unknown. Vasari tells us that he executed work for the Duke of Urbino in 1473 and 1474. The picture of the Last Supper that he did at that time is still in Urbino, "unless the Germans have removed it." On the basis of this painting, an altarpiece of the Crucifixion, in the Cathedral of St. Bavon at Ghent, is attributed to him. The painting in the Metropolitan is unquestionably by the same hand, and is the only work of this master in the United States. It is said to have formerly belonged to the Dukes of Frias, kept in their Convento de Santa Clara near Burgos. About 1922 it came to Paris, when Mr. Blumen- thal purchased it. Joos remained at Urbino, re- ceived other orders in 1474 and 1475, and his last painting, a portrait of Federigo, Duke of Ur- bino, and his son Guidobaldo, is dated about 1480.</page><page sequence="19">92 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Tilman Riemenschneider.- This sculptor of the Late Gothic Age in Germany is studied by JuSTus BIER in Art in America xxxi, 1943, pp. 172-182 (5 figs.). The known list of his works is not large, but in this article two hitherto unknown monuments are added, those of a Franconian knight, Heinrich Stieber von Buttenheim, and his wife Elizabeth. First in importance of the two is that of Elizabeth, who died in 1507, and lies in the parish church of Buttenheim, where the monuments are still pre- served. Her husband died three weeks later. The monument to Elizabeth shows Riemenschneider's own hand, while her husband's "rates as a work executed under his supervision" and "as a good workshop piece, but nothing more." Originally made as standing wall monuments, they have suffered some minor damages. Riemenschneider had made the monument for Elizabeth's father, who died in 1487, which is doubtless why he was commissioned to make these two, and per- sonally did the monument to her, perhaps because of this family connection. The two monuments are fully described, and compared with other known works of the master. Owing to the two deaths being so close together, both were undoubtedly commissioned at the same time. The composition of the monument to Heinrich seems to be greatly influenced by the engraving of St. George on Foot by Dtirer, which had just been published. London.- Announcement is made by The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 54, that the National Art Col- lections Fund has acquired for the Tower Museum the collection of arms and armor of Norton Hall in Northamptonshire. There are six complete suits of armor, one of which is dated in 1470, and two which date from the sixteenth century, and were obviously made for the Spanish court. Many other interesting items, some of extreme rarity, are included. - Ibid., p. 91, states that through the aid of the same Fund, the Victoria and Albert Museum has acquired a terracotta statuette of St. Michael by Pedro Millin, of a height of 90 cm., dating in the early 1500's, one of the few examples of Spanish Gothic sculpture to be seen outside Spain. RENAISSANCE The Osonas.-To the known works of these painters, who were among the earliest exemplars of the Renaissance in Spain, CHANDLER R. POST, in GBA. ser. vi, xxiv, 1943, pp. 273-282 (12 figs.) adds a number, especially by Rodrigo Osona the younger. Three companion pieces in the Johnson collection in Philadelphia are attributed to him in collaboration with his father, Rodrigo the elder; while by him alone is a pair of panels in the Prado, acquired in 1941, and a painting of Christ Bearing the Cross in a private collection in Palma de Mallorca. A panel of the Nativity in the col- lection of Mrs. Maria Dernburg in New York is regarded as a studio piece by a pupil working under his direction. Italian Quattrocento Sculpture. - GEORG SWAR- ZENSKI continues, in GBA. ser. vi, xxiv, 1943, pp. 283-304 (17 figs.) (see AJA. xlviii, 1944, p. 197) his studies of sculptures in the National Gallery in Washington. The collection of Quattrocento busts is one of the largest in existence. All are portraits. The earlier periods are represented by one small piece, a Madonna from the Kress collec- tion, attributed to Tino da Camaino. Donatello is represented by the Martelli David (from the Widener collection), a polychrome terracotta Ma- donna (from the Mellon) a Laughing Cupid in bronze from the Widener, and two busts of the youthful St. John from the Kress and Mellon. Six works by Desiderio are included, of which four are busts; one of these, formerly called Giovanna d'Albizzi, (Mellon) is executed in wood, canvas and gesso, and is in poor preservation- the other three busts are in marble. That of Marietta Strozzi is unfinished, while that of Isotta da Rimini (Kress) is a masterpiece. A bust of a boy (Mellon) is characteristic of Desiderio's most suc- cessful work. In addition to these busts, there are two reliefs, one of the Madonna (Mellon) and one of St. Jerome (Widener). Antonio Rosellino is represented by two busts and three other sculptures. The busts are of boys, one from the Kress, the other from the Mellon-the former is often called a St. John the Baptist, and is strongly suggestive of Desiderio. A clay statuette of the seated Madonna (Mellon) is "a more personal expression of Rossellino's art." A stucco relief of the Madonna with heads of angels (Kress) is an "obvious" example of his style, while a large marble Madonna relief from the same collection is "a brilliant example" of Florentine Quattrocento sculpture. Of Duccio, a Madonna relief (Mellon) "reveals his unique spirit." There is a large group of works of Mino da Fiesole- perhaps the most interesting is a "superb" pair of allegorical figures (Mellon), which "are the most perfect expression of Mino's personality." Other examples are a Madonna relief from the same collection, a stucco bust of Rinaldo della Luna and a bust of St.</page><page sequence="20">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 293 Catherine of Siena (both Kress) and a bust of Astorgio Manfredi (Widener). In this last bust the signature appears as "Nino" rather than "Mino"-a mistake which also occurs on a bust in Berlin. Two busts by Benedetto da Maiano come from the Kress and Widener collections- that from the Kress, a terracotta male head and shoulders, is an outstanding example. Pollaiuolo is represented by a bronze bust of a warrior (Kress) which is attributed to him on the basis of a similar bust in the Bargello. Of Verrocchio's work there are many outstanding examples. Best of all is the bust of Giuliano Medici (Mellon), while rare for him is a terracotta relief of the Adoration (Kress), an example hitherto unknown. There are Della Robbias, but none of superlative merit. Finally, a statuette of St. Sebastian by Matteo Civitale (Kress) is signalized as typical of this master's work. Turning from the Florentine Quattrocento to the school of Milan, three sculptures are attributed to Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, of which perhaps the finest is the portrait in relief of Filippo Maria Visconti (Kress). Other Milanese sculptures are mentioned, showing the close connection with Venice. The Gallery also has examples of the work of sculptors of Lombard origin, who worked in Southern Italy and Sicily. Finally, mention is made of the marble bust of Giovanni Capponi by Leone Leoni (Kress) as an early Cinquecento masterpiece. Of Cinquecento sculpture, the Mellon collec- tion includes two early statues by Sansovino, a Venus and a Bacchus, both belonging to "the most perfect examples of High Renaissance statu- ary." Another example is an original version of the Mercury of Giovanni da Bologna, the only piece of sculpture in the round by this master in America. Milan.-- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 69, gives an impressive list of churches and public buildings destroyed or damaged in air raids up to Septem- ber 1943. The churches include San Ambrogio, San Nazaro, Santa Babila, San Satiro, San Se- bastiano, San Giorgio, San Fedele, San Antonio, and San Simpliciano. The Cathedral has suffered but slight injuries; some statues have been de- stroyed, most of them damaged, while the win- dows had been removed to safety. Of secular buildings, the Brera was hit, as well as a wing of the Castello Sforzesco, the Archiepiscopal Palace, the Ambrosiana Library, the Palazzo Reale, the Palazzo del Senato, and the Casa Fontana, the oldest house in the city. The terracotta facade of the Ospedale Maggiore is nearly all safe, although the building was hit. The Scala theatre was also hit, but can be restored. Genoa.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, lists the monuments in Genoa damaged, if not destroyed in air raids, up to September 1943. Of interest to readers of this JOURNAL are the churches of Santa Maria di Carignano, and San Siro, both of Renaissance construction, although the latter is an earlier church rebuilt in the Baroque style. Naples.- The New Pallas vii, 1943. pp. 69, 84, gives some information on the losses suffered by Naples in the war. Santa Chiara has gone, but its campanile and cloisters are safe. The cathe- dral, San Martino, and most of the churches and monasteries are intact. The upper story of the Palazzo Reale has suffered much, and the Palazzo d'Angri (1773) and the Palazzo Maddaloni (ca. 1650) have been damaged. The National Museum is intact as far as the building is concerned. Turin. - During the air raids on the city, ac- cording to The New Pallas (vii, 1943, p. 70) the Town Hall, or Palazzo di Citth and the Palazzo Carignano were damaged, if not destroyed; both are of the seventeenth century. Two churches (Carmine and San Giovanni) are also mentioned as having been hit. A New Attribution.-A portrait of a Knight of Malta, from the Blumenthal collection in New York, previously considered an early work of El Greco, is denied him by MARGARETTA SAL- INGER, and quite convincingly attributed to Jacopino del Conte (1510-1598), a painter who today enjoys little reputation, but was greatly esteemed by Vasari (BMMA. n.s. ii, 1944, pp. 164-165, fig.). Attribution to Cranach. - The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 63, tells of a Madonna belonging to the church at Pollin in the Bohemian Forest, which was sent to Prague for restoration. At Prague it was discovered that the same model was used for the Madonna as for the painting of the same subject, known to be by Cranach, in the Cathedral at Breslau.. The same is also true in the case of the Child. The picture is therefore attributed to Cranach, and is of the same period as the Breslau Madonna. Florence.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 64, gives the information that the frescoes by Filip- pino Lippi of the Church of Santa Maria del Carmine are being restored, and when completed, will be put in a place of safety.</page><page sequence="21">294 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY A New Titian.- According to The New Pallas (vii, 1943, p. 63) a painting in a private collection at Savona, representing the Madonna blessing two kneeling figures and surrounded by soaring angels, in front of an architectural background, has been submitted to the opinion of authorities, prior to consideration of a sale. These authorities consider it a late work of Titian, and have sent it to Rome for closer examination. In the mean- time, it has been insured for two million lire. Diane de Poitiers and Jean Cousin.- The Met- ropolitan Museum has recently received as a gift from the children of Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney two of the magnificent tapestries, the design of which is attributed to Jean Cousin, made for the mansion of Diane de Poitiers at Anet. There were eight in the set, four of which, after passing through other hands, are now back at Anet; one is in the Museum of Rouen, and one in a dealer's possession in New York. The two in the Metropolitan, portraying the Drowning of Britomartis, and the Blasphemy of Niobe, are described and published by JOHN GOLDSMITH PHILLIPS in BMMA. n.s., ii, 1943, pp. 109-117 (4 figs.). The subject of each tapestry is described in ten lines of verse, perhaps by Joachim de Bellay. The connection of the myth of Britomartis with the invention of nets and snares by Apollo is well depicted, while Diana arrives on the scene just as Britomartis is about to sink. Of course Diana is a portrait of Diane de Poitiers, and is so identified by the presence of her ciphers and insignia on the goddess's garments, and by the resemblance to her accepted portraits. Jean Cousin, who is believed to be the designer of the tapestries, is the first of his name- a son followed his footsteps. He was a typical product of the Renaissance-a painter of note, a master of the graphic arts, an architect, a sculptor, and a stu- dent of perspective, on which he wrote a book. If living today, he would probably be a scientist or an engineer, for he also has a number of inven- tions to his credit. Other tapestry designs by him are known - one of a set of eight, of scenes from the life of St. Mammas, now in private possession in France, is illustrated for purposes of com- parison. The previous attributions of the (lost) stained glass windows at Anet to Cousin, long disputed and rejected, should now be reconsidered in his favor. The tapestries were probably made in Paris and a date in the last half of the sixteenth century is suggested. Paris. -According to The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 75, the marble statue of the Mater Dolorosa in the Church of St. Paul, ordered in 1586 from the sculptor Germain Pilon by Catherine de Medici, has been restored at the expense of the city under the supervision of the Service des Monuments Historiques. In carrying out the restoration, use was freely made of the clay model in the Louvre. The "Drake Cup." - The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 88, reports that the National Art Collections Fund of England has acquired this object. It is a representation of the globe made in the sixteenth century by the Swiss goldsmith, Abraham Gessner, and is said to have been presented by Queen Eliz- abeth to Sir Francis Drake. Long in a private collection in England, it was sold at auction in 1942, when the Fund purchased it. It has been presented to the city of Plymouth in recognition of her courage during the air raids. Spiral Towers in Europe.-In GBA. ser. vi, xxiv, 1943, pp. 233-948 (15 figs.) WOLFGANG BORN describes Boromini's Church of St. Ivo in Rome (1660) in the courtyard of the present University. The design of its dome is unusual, in combining a number of heterogeneous elements in a common stylistic background. Of interest is the spire above the lantern, which is helical, and characteristic of his "feverish Baroque style." The stepped roof of St. Ivo is patterned after the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, the lantern follows the Round Temple of Baalbek, while the helical spire is taken from the traditional concept of the Tower of Babel. The writer takes up the study of spiral towers, beginning with the Mesopotamian zigurrats, which were ascended by outside stair- ways. Herodotos refers to a "Temple of Bel" at Babylon with a circular flight of stairs. Excava- tions on the site show that the zigurrat was not so built, but was ascended by free-standing staircases, so what Herodotos must have referred to is another structure, now lost. Such writers as the Byzantine Cosmas Indicopleustes and Ben- jamin of Tudela described what they believed to be the Tower of Babel as a spiral tower, and sim- ilar towers have been found in Persia and Mesopo- tamia. Islamic architecture used this principle in the construction of minarets (mosques in Samarra and Cairo are described and illustrated). The writer then discusses the iconography of the Tower of Babel in Europe, illustrating his descrip- tion with numerous examples. Beginning as a square building with outside steps, it eventually became a conical tower with a spiral ramp or staircase. This is perhaps due to a closer contact</page><page sequence="22">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 295 with the Near East in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The illustrations of the Tower of Babel inspired the Augsburg clockmaker Hans Schlott- heim (1547-1625) to use Biblical motifs for decorating a table clock in 1585, now in Dresden, which is surmounted with a helical spire, with an outside ramp. Also in Dresden is another clock by this maker dated in 1602, in the form of the Tower of Babel, represented as hexagonal, stepped, and also crowned with a helical spire. In 1679 the German Jesuit, Athanasius Kircher, founder of the Museo Kircheriano in Rome, pub- lished a book devoted to the restoration of the Tower of Babel, on which he had been working for the previous fifteen years, and in which Baroque influence is felt (an illustration from this book is reproduced). It is believed that Boromini must have known Kircher, and that his design for the spire of St. Ivo was derived from some of the im- plications of the Tower of Babel. It is obvious that Boromini's spire shows a strong resemblance to that of Schlottheim's clock of 1585, and the design may well have been communicated to him by Kircher. Another Baroque church with a spiral spire was San Gregorio at Messina (after 1660) destroyed in the earthquake of 1908, built by Guarino Guarini (1624-1685). Another archi- tect who used the spiral motif was Count Amadeo di Castelmonte (1646-1683; two of his designs re- produced). It persists into the eighteenth century, and was employed in one of Piranesi's engravings. The article ends with the introduction of this motif from Italy into Northern Europe, particularly Scandinavia. FAR EAST London.- The New Pallas vii, 1943, p. 65, mentions an important exhibition of Animals in Chinese Art held in the Berkeley Galleries in London during May and June, 1943. U.S.S.R. The following data continue the translation and summary of the Jubilee volume published in 1942 by the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences in celebration of the twenty-fifth anni- versary of Soviet scholarship. This section of the volume, which was edited by V. P. VOLGIN, E. V. TARLE and A. M. PANKVATOVA, was written by S. V. KISELEV. The footnotes and bibliograph- ical references have been omitted. Siberia. - Considerable attention was focused upon the study of Scytho-Sarmatian monuments in the Sayan-Altai uplands and the Baikal area. It was found there that from its cultural begin- nings in the highly developed Upper Bronze Age ("Karasuk") culture, the population progressed far in its development -attaining great success in agriculture (partly irrigated), in the arts of war and in the applied arts. At the same time, the outward forms of material culture, such as the shape of ornaments and weap- ons, the prevalence of the so-called Scytho- Siberian animal style, were found to be very close to Scythian. Here belong the culture of the "slab burials" on the Selenga River, Tagar cul- ture on the Yenisei, and the Maiemir culture in the Altai. Similar discoveries had previously been made by the Soviet Expeditions to Outer Mon- golia and Tannu Tuva. The Scythian and a series of cultures resembling Scythian had left on the steppes of Eurasia widely distributed traces of a highly homogeneous cultural-historical stage, which resulted in many of the most important developments of Oriental History. Despite a strong Chinese influence demon- strated by P. Kozlov in the tumuli of Noin-Ula in northern Mongolia, the culture of the Huns shows a fundamental affinity to the more ancient culture with Scythian affinities. At the same time the peculiarities of the Hunnic art-such as the ornamentation of the favorite animal struggle scenes by multicolored inlay or incrustation - sug- gest the comparison with Sarmatian art. This is also true of the cultures of other regions in southern Siberia. The finds from this so-called "Tashtyk" Period on the middle course of the Yenisei River, dis- covered during the excavations of the sumptuous burials of tribal leaders, included many artistic carvings related closely to both Hunnic and Sarmatian motifs. In addition, the enormous stone tumuli from the Altai, such as the Pazyryk tumulus, explored by M. P. Griaznov, yielded many objects decorated with effigies of animals and depicting animal battle scenes. The carvings and the applique work in felt and leather were richly colored in the Hunnic-Sarma- tian style. The cultural unity of the steppe popula- tions was as strong at this time as it was during the Scythian Period. The Hunnic-Sarmatian Period was characterized by internal and external con- flicts originating from the gradual breakdown of their primordial unity and their clan organiza- tion. At the same time this was the period during which was formed the contemporary physical type</page><page sequence="23">296 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY of the peoples of Central Asia. This is most clearly demonstrated by the remarkable two-thousand- year-old portrait gallery of mortuary masks from Tashtyk. These plaster casts were taken from the faces of the dead before cremation. The study of the masks shows how the Palaeo-Europoid type, which dominated the Siberian steppes during the Bronze Age is replaced by the new Mongoloid type. During the Hunnic-Sarmatian Period southern Siberia had strong cultural connections with China. Many Chinese objects have been found. Typical were the ceremonial Chinese umbrellas presented to leaders of allied tribes by the Em- perors found in the burials of Tashtykian aris- tocracy. Of particular interest in this connection were the excavations begun in 1941 by L. A. Evtiukhova and V. P. Levasheva near Abakan, of a palace which is of Chinese architecture and roofed with tiles bearing Han inscriptions. The extent of penetration of the southern Si- berian tradition of the Hunnic-Sarmatian art is shown by the recent excavations at Ust Polu near Salekhard, where at the site of a sanctuary were found remarkable carved spoons and combs dec- orated with animal style ornamentation. V. N. Chernetsov's studies reveal that these discoveries shed much light upon the origin of the Ob River Ugrians. During the sixth to the seventh century A.D., the population of southern Siberia had succeeded in creating a powerful state with a highly devel- oped culture, which in many respects served as a model for all nomadic tribes of the more westerly steppes. The Altaian tribes, whose culture has been recently brought to light by the excavations of A. Glukhov, S. Kiselev, and L. Evtiukhova, had in the sixth century formed the extensive Turki State, known as Tug'yu to the Chinese chroniclers. This State, which embraced the area lying between the Great Hingan and Zeravshan, extended from China to the Altai Mountains. The fact that the original Orkhon writing was used by the Turki nobles for mass propaganda, is witness to the relatively high level of their civili- zation. A comparable cultural level was attained by the population of the Baikal area. The investi- gations of the sites of the so-called "Kurumchi Blacksmiths" by the University of Irkutsk have disclosed the fact that in the sixth to the seventh century A.D. the people of the Baikal area were able to smelt cast iron, about nine centuries earlier than in Europe. The monuments of the Kirghiz State on the middle Yenisei show this dread rival of the Orkhon Turks to have been possessed of a very high level of culture. Agricul- tural implements, as well as the weapons, demon- strate their great skill as plowmen and soldiers. Most remarkable are the finds made in the tumuli of the Kirghiz nobles excavated by Evtiukhova at Kopeny on the Yenisei River. Finely embellished golden vessels, hunting scene ornaments on saddle accoutrements, rich harness decorations - all these were distinguished by exquisite artistic taste, and show not only familiarity of Kirghiz artists with the art of China and Iran, but also their ability to get away from sheer imitation of samples, and to create as their basis a highly individual, very realistic style of their own. The finds and inscrip- tions (including epitaphs of various Khans and Begs) from Kopeny depict the internal life of the Kirghiz state, governed by a sybaritic slave-own- ing aristocracy exacting heavy taxes from its subjects. European Russia.- The early middle ages in southern Russia are particularly well represented by the ruins of the Khazar fortress of Sarkel, ini- tiated under the leadership of M. I. Artamonov. The inventories show that the material culture of the Khazar people was not homogeneous, and that it largely consisted of the ancient native Sarmato- Alanic elements, strongly affected by a nomadic culture related to that of the Turki of Siberia. This apparently reflects the ethnic complexity of the Khazar State, which was an advanced base of the Turkish Kaganate on the Volga and in the Caucasus. A great change has also taken place in our knowledge of the rival state of the Khazars, the realm of the Volga Bulgars. Pre-Tartar Bul- garian inventories and even architecture have been identified by A. P. Smirnov from the excava- tions of the ancient Bulgarian city of Suvar and of its necropolis. The Tartar monuments of Bulgar and Suvar had also been studied. Of particular interest was a palatial structure at Bulgar which proved to be the sumptuously decorated Oriental baths, furnished with central heating, running hot and cold water, and a jet fountain. From the study of the complex, Smirnov concludes that this culture was of local origin, having been originated in part by the settled peoples of the Volga area (the makers of the "bast-mat" - rogozhnaia- pottery) and also by the nomadic cattle-breeders belonging to the Sarmatian group of tribes. Ac- cording to Smirnov, to this Bulgarian culture could be attributed the peculiar status of the</page><page sequence="24">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 297 Volga-Kama Region during the Golden Horde Period. The principal monuments of the Golden Horde, including Sarai-Baru, Sarai Berke, Uvek, and many other gorodishches, have been excavated on a large scale, mainly by Saratov archaeologists. The results of the excavations, published only incompletely and in a fragmentary form, yielded very important materials for the study of the urban life, architecture, and city planning of the Golden Horde. Many special investigations, such as the study of the pottery, by A. IU. IAku- bovskii, have shown the great complexity of the culture of the Golden Horde cities. They demon- strate its dependence upon those Oriental and Occidental centers, which had been forced to con- tribute the artists and technicians to create the sumptuous and frequently highly artistic exterior of the centers of Mongol servitude. During the pre-Revolutionary period, the ar- chaeological study of ancient Russia was largely limited to the excavation of the tumuli of the east- ern Slavs. Practically no explorations had been conducted in the ancient Russian cities. The prob- lems of the origin of eastern Slavs were usually dis- cussed without the use of archaeological materials. During the Soviet Period all this was changed. The study of the so-called "Romenskie" goro- dishches and the south Russian hoards of the fifth to the seventh centuries made it possible to pose before archaeologists the problem of the cul.- ture of the Antae and of the relation of the An- taean Union to the Kievan Russia. B. A. Ryba- kov's work has brought to light strong archaeologi- cal evidence supporting the contention that the culture of the Slavic tribes of Kievan Russia was a successor of the culture of the Antae. Conse- quently it became possible to place the formation of the Dnieprovian Slavs in a very remote past. A parallel accumulation of materials on the late Diakovo gorodishches of the Volga-Oka Mesopo- tamia and the early burials of the Vyatichi, Krivichi, and Novgorod Slovens have enabled the archaeological group headed by P. N. Tretiakov to depict the formation of the northeastern Slavic tribes as a local process conditioned by the entire past history of the Volga-Oka populations known by the materials from the Diakovo gorodishches. Another parallel is available in the case of the formation of other peoples of the Volga-Oka basin, the Meri people (Sarskoe gorodishche near Rostov) the Muromians and the Mordovians, all connected with the local population responsible for the Lower Oka and Middle Volga gorodishches of the " Gorodetski" type. Such a solution changes the customary theories of ethnic origins of eastern Europe based largely on philological evidence. It discredits the notion of constant enmity of Slavs with their neighbors, a notion which was created under the influence of historical events and ideas of much later times. Monographic investigations of individual east- ern Slavic tribes became possible as a result of numerous excavations of Slavic tumuli from the eleventh to the fourteenth centuries. Of particular interest are the studies of the Vyatichi by A. V. Artsikhovskii, Radimichi by B. A. Rybakov and Krivichi by P. N. Tretiakov. Many changes have been introduced into the accepted chronologies and definitions dealing with these ethnic group- ings. Most successful, however, were the recent studies of ancient Russian cities. The oldest dwellings and defensive structures, attributed to the eighth or ninth century had been discovered in Kiev, and the dwellings and some craft shops of the Grand Ducal Period have been studied. Archaeological work in Sophia Cathedral disclosed ancient frescoes depicting many historic characters, including the family of Yaroslav the Wise. The burial of Yaroslav had been uncovered and an attempt was made by M. M. Gerasimov to reconstruct, on the basis of the skeletal remains, the physical appearance of the outstanding ruler and lawgiver of ancient Russia. Abundant mate- rials, pertaining in the main to the history of urban culture, had been secured from many smaller ancient cities of Kievan Russia. Of partic- ular interest were such finds as the ancient smith- ies at Vyshgorod, with ceramic forges and iron pigs. Large-scale excavations of Raika near Ber- dichev, which had been completely destroyed in 1258 by Daniil, Prince of Galich, had resulted in an unusual collection of everyday objects of the thirteenth century including many tools of black- smiths, jewellers, armorers, and potters. New valuable data have come to light as a result of the excavations on the territory of the little known South Russian Slavic principality of Tmutarakan. Typically Slavic pottery had been found in the upper strata of the gorodishche at Taman, and similar finds have been made at the Koktebel gorodishche in the Crimea. M. I. Arta- monov's investigations on the Don show that the Don River Valley was an area of intensive Sla- vonic colonization (largely out of Chernigov) dur- ing the eleventh century, and that Tumtarakan</page><page sequence="25">298 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY was not an isolated outpost of the Slavs in the Black Sea area, but that it was territorially con- nected with Russia proper. Large-scale excavations have been conducted in Novgorod by A. V. Artsikhovskii and the Nov- gorod Historical Museum. The excavations have disclosed the very high level of the communal cul- ture of old Novgorod. The city had not only been paved much earlier than the contemporary cities of Western Europe, but it had also anticipated them in having water mains and sewers (beginning with the eleventh century). The majority of the domestic sites excavated in Novgorod belonged to tradesmen. Particularly interesting were the finds from the houses of a shoemaker and a potter. The finds permit complete reconstruction of manufac- tur'ng processes. The excavations at the Torg (old market place) showed the presence of large amounts of seeds of cereals, fruit, berries, and vegetables. This permits us to depict a detailed picture of the fruit and truck garden economy in the suburbs of Novgorod. The cities of northeastern Russia have also been intensively studied. In 1926 V. A. Gorodtsov con- ducted large excavations at the site of old Ryazan, burned down on December 9.3, 1237, by Khan Batu. Many objects, abandoned by the inhabi- tants during the attack came to light, including a complete blacksmith's shop and the shop of a maker of amber ornaments. Analogous materials have been collected from the excavations in Suz- dal and Vladimir. N. I. Voronin excavated Prince Andrew's palace compound at Bogolyubovo. In- vestigating the area around the famous tower with anteroom, Voronin found the remains of cloisters connecting the palace with the tower and the chapel, and also discovered some valuable archi- tectural details in the ancient portion of the church. The finely carved stone ornaments and filigree details of gilded copper permit the recon- struction of the sumptuous and refined decoration of the Bogolyubov palace complex, which in its size exceeded similar edifices of Medieval Europe. The conditions of life in the cities of later feudal periods have also been disclosed. The Kremlins of Tver and Dmitrov, Pronsk gorodishche and old Radonezh near Zagorsk have been excavated by Milonov, and S. A. Tarakanova excavated the rural feudal settlements near Novgorod. A large archaeological task was performed in connection with the digging of the Moscow sub- way. Archaeologists attached to the excavating crews have succeeded not only in determining a complete archaeological cross-section of Moscow, but also in exploring many important sections of the ancient city. Thus, it was possible to recon- struct the fortifications of Zemlianoi Gorod and Belyi Gorod, which had long disappeared, to investigate the towers and walls of Kitaigorod, to solve many problems of historical topography of Moscow, the location of many streets, buildings, churches, and suburban villas. The finds were extremely rich, including costumes of Moscow nobles of the seventeenth and eighteenth cen- turies, weapons, and many every-day objects. A very extensive work on restoring ancient Russian monuments had been performed. Most important of these were the Sophia Cathedral in Kiev, Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod, IUriev Monastery Church in Novgorod, Trinity-Sergius Monastery near Moscow, cathedrals and palaces of Kremlin. A completely new approach to the ancient architecture of Russia has become pos- sible. The same is true of much new data bearing on the history of the ancient Russian art, resulting from the restoration of frescoes, mosaics, and icons in old churches in Kiev, Vladimir, and else- where. Caucasus.- The study of ancient Caucasian cultures was initiated in Soviet Russia by N. MARR, and continued by his students. The Caucasus was one of the oldest centers of metallurgical culture, and held a paramount world position as a bridge between the lands of Western Asia and the Classical Orient on one side and the Aegean Anatolian world and northeastern Africa on the other. Thus, this area has commanded ex- ceptional attention from Soviet scientists. Recent archaeological investigations have embraced a very large area, in North Caucasus, Kabardinia, Ossetia, and in all areas of Trans-Caucasia. The Black Sea littoral (Abkhazia) has also been stud- ied extensively, as well as mountainous Karabakh on the Armenian-Iranian frontier. As a result of intensive recent study the Caucasus appears to have been one of the ancient focal points of culture. The antiquity of Caucasian cultures and tribes was first proven by the discovery of a Neander- thaloid skull near Pyatigorsk, and the Mesolithic site of Ilskaia in North Caucasus. However, from the points of view of history and archaeology, the most interesting periods were the early Metal Ages, the Chalcolithic Period and the so-called Bronze Age. Consequently, much attention was paid by Soviet archaeologists to the investigations</page><page sequence="26">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 299 of the regions which were likely to shed new light upon the problem of the origin and development of metallurgy in the ancient Caucasus. Thus, during 1924-1926 GAIMK excavated Kobyakovo gorodishche near Aksaiskaia in North Caucasus, where the lowest cultural strata were found to contain monuments of two ancient pre-Scythian cultures. These strata contained both metal and stone inventories, which made it possible to at- tribute them to the Chalcolithic Period. More- over, in the second pre-Scythian stratum were found such inventories as flint flakes, flint arrow- heads, pressure-flakers, scrapers, hammers, and both polished and perforated implements. A ham- mer-axe, found in this horizon, was of especial interest. Some of the objects were manufactured of local, shell-containing limestone, which sug- gests the antiquity of a local stone-working craft. Bronze fragments and long-legged crucibles were found in the same stratum, testifying that metal smelting was already practiced in this region of the North Caucasus during the early Chalcolithic Period. It is evident that copper was smelted as well as a low-grade bronze containing a small ad- mixture of tin. There are some considerations which indicate that this local North Caucasian industry was in some degree connected with the ancient metallurgical centers of Western Asia. The pottery from this period is also typical. The vessels restored from fragments were hand- made, wide-mouthed, spherical, flat-bottomed vessels decorated with geometric carved or string- stamped ornament consisting of short lines, fir- tree designs, and chevrons. The anthropomorphic stone figurines were cur- iously reminiscent of the archaic Egyptian ithy- phallic statues of the god Min from Koptos. Fi- nally, of great interest was the distribution of animal remains from Kobyakovo gorodishche. Small horned animals (Capreolus and Ovis) pre- dominated (34% of the bones); Canis was second (27%), Bos domesticus, 15%, and Equus caballus was already known (7.5%). The same traits characterize the finds made in the first pre-Scytbian cultural stratum which also belongs to the period of the first appearance of metal. In addition to the flint pressure-flakers, points and scraper-like implements of quartzite, fragments of copper and bronze objects are found together with crucibles suggesting the local nature of the North Caucasian metallurgy. The sherds were also covered with geometric ornament. With a slight variation, the proportion of genera represented by skeletal materials is identical. All this suggests an exceptionally slow tempo in the development of the North Caucasian culture during the Chalcolithic period, which was also typical of the development of all Caucasian cultures during that period. The classical center of ancient Caucasian bronze metallurgy was the Koban region, located in Ossetia. While many bronzes of the Kobanian Epoch and others of a related type had been found before the Revolution, most of these came from predatory or unsystematic excavations, so that it was impossible to trace the succession of cul- tural strata, to date the finds, and to formulate the historico-archaeological characterization of the Koban culture. During 1935 the excavations in Digoria in North Ossetia by the Historical Museum (Mos- cow) Expedition under the leadership of E. I. Krupnov revealed the remains of a pre-Kobanian culture in Galiati cemetery. Among the typical finds were bronze ornaments and an example of the most archaic classical flexed burial. In the Tagauri area near the Upper Kobani River, Krup- nov found a curious combination of stone and bronze inventories. All these finds indicate the great antiquity of the pre-Kobanian, and partly, Kobanian culture which are obviously intercon- nected not merely territorially. The bronze knife and flint arrowhead from Tagauri have been at- tributed by E. I. Krupnov to the second millen- nium B.C. A Kobanian village site, which was found nearby at Kamunta, yielded a bronze fibula of an extremely rare type. The Digorian excavations were continued through 1937-1938 at Upper Rutkha burial site and resulted in very rich finds (largely bronze) belonging to several stages of the Kobanian culture. In this case also was found the combination of bronze and stone inventories and in addition polished and drilled stone axes, to- gether with bronze weapons and ornaments, and a simultaneous utilization of flint and bronze arrow- heads. Here also were excavated slab-faced, rec- tangular collective burials, and vestiges of partial incineration. All this material will permit the study of roots and stages of Kobanian culture and also will determine obvious connections between the Kobanian monuments and analogous bronze inventories from other archaeological areas of the Caucasus. Thus, a typical Kobani inventory had been found in 1921 in Ordzhonikidze (formerly Vladikavkaz). Objects of Kobanian type had also</page><page sequence="27">300 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY been found in Kabardinia and also (hidden in pots) in Abkhazia. It appears, therefore, that the entire region of the Central Caucasus (Kabardinia, North Ossetia, and Checheno-Ingushetia) is covered with Bronze Age monuments, largely of the Kobanian Epoch. This is, undoubtedly, the location of one of the centers of bronze metallurgy, which had retained its importance well into the Middle Ages (cf. the excavations in the catacomb burial ground near Argun River). Relatively large-scale excavations had been conducted by the North Caucasian Expedition of the Historical Museum of 1939 in Checheno- Ingushetia and Daghestan, notably in the Chechen Mountains and along the shore of the Caspian. Many Bronze Age finds had been made, begin- ning with the second millennium B.C. Of particu- lar interest is a group of monuments contempo- raneous typologically with Kobanian burials from the western Caucasus (first millennium B.C.). Among important objects was a group of stone box burials near Khorochoi, accompanied by fir- tree ornamented pottery, flint arrowheads and bronze ornaments. Of great interest is the image of a two-wheeled cart with spoked wheels, found on the walls of a stone box near Berekei. This not only gives us a picture of an ancient Caucasian vehicle, but also enables us to establish a connec- tion between the ancient cultures of Central Caucasus and Western Asia where the most prim- itive type of chariot had made its first appearance at the end of the fourth millennium in Sumer. [The oldest wheeled vehicle was excavated by the Field Museum-Oxford University Joint Expedi- tion at Kish during March, 1928. This vehicle is attributed to the period about 3,000 B.C.] Finally, a long series of objects (storage pits, querns, pes- tles, flint sickle blades, and bones) gives abundant material for the reconstruction of the economic life of the epoch. Many Megalithic monuments (menhirs and dolmens) have been preserved throughout the Caucasus. This important group also includes Cyclopic structures, particularly fortresses. A large number of these have been discovered, mapped, described, and partly excavated during the past twenty-five years. The problem of com- parative investigation of the Cyclopic and Mega- lithic monuments in the Caucasus had been formulated. Excavations of dolmens had been conducted by B. V. Lunin during 1923-1924 upon the Black Sea littoral of the Caucasus near Krasnoaleksandrov- ski on the Ash River. Here at the corners of one of the dolmens were found polished stone axes, bronze objects, and menhir-like structures. These and other excavations (e.g. of the dolmens at Gelendzhik on the Black Sea) indicate that many of the Caucasian Megalithic monuments should be attributed to the Chalcolithic or even to the Bronze Age. Other important Megalithic studies were made in Abkhazia during 1934 by I. I. Meshchaninov and in 1937 by Soloviev and Lukin. The objects belonged to two cultural strata. The lower stra- tum, much earlier than the upper, belonged to the period of the erection of the dolmen. The upper stratum showed that the burial rites connected with the Megalithic structures had been long in existence. In both strata were found copper and bronze objects, some of which were related to the Kobanian culture, specifically to the inventories from the Digorian burials. Consequently these dolmens may be connected with the monuments from the Kobanian Period. Important archaeological work has also been conducted in Azerbaidzhan, mainly in the moun- tainous Karabakh area, where many monuments were found. These appeared to have been closely connected with the ancient Oriental cultures, and particularly with the Urartu. These finds may shed light upon the extent of the Urartian King- dom, and upon the reciprocal influences between the Caucasian and Urartian cultures. Investiga- tions here show that in the remote past the Urar- tian, and related to them the Japhethic, tribes liv- ing in the Caucasus succeeded in developing a high and original culture and establishing a strong independent state. These Urartian and the re- lated ancient Caucasian cultures were closely connected with the great cultures of the ancient Near East. During 1926 I. I. Meshchaninov found in Ky- zyl-Vank the original painted pottery attributed to the second millennium B.c. Painted pottery from the same period had been found in 1926 by A. Alekperov on Milskaia steppe. In some respects this pottery is closely related to analogous objects found near Borchaly in Georgia; at the same time it shows some connection with the ancient Hittite and Elamitic cultures. Meshchaninov considers this painted pottery from Azerbaidzhan "not an isolated phenomenon, but representative of the Western Asiatic world." To the same group of monuments belong inventories of the white in-</page><page sequence="28">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 301 crusted Rtissler culture discovered in Gandzha Raion. In ornamentation the pottery of this cul- ture is closely related to the Elamite culture of Mussian. At the same site were found bronze and iron objects of the Khaldic Epoch. Thus, these objects may also be closely connected with the culture of ancient Western Asia. Of great importance have been the explorations of the Cyclopean fortresses of Azerbaidzhan, no- tably those conducted by A. Alekperov and I. Dzhafar-Zade. Some of the fortresses "are dated by the oldest written testimony in Trans-Cau- casia of the Khaldic (Urartian) Period." In 1927 were explored the Cyclopean fortresses in the Airum Mountains in Gandzha Raion, Azerbaidz- han. In 1928 Alekperov and Dzhafar-Zade dis- covered in Kalakent Cyclopean masonry in an excellent state of preservation, and it was even possible to reconstruct the ground plan of the fortress characterized by terrace-like remains of surviving walls. Near one of the fortresses were found extensive burial grounds of stone box burials. An analogous stone box with typical Trans-Caucasian Bronze inventory of the Khaldic Period (ninth-seventh century B.c.) had been found in 1995 near Baen. Consequently, this arch- aeological complex was also closely connected with the Urartian epoch and culture. During 1926 Meshchaninov initiated the exca- vations in the mountainous Karabakh and in the Nakhichevan areas. At Khodzhaly, tumuli of five different types have been discovered and exca- vated; a stone tumulus here contained a burial vault constructed of slabs; inventories included bronze objects and 1,500 sardonyx beads. At the same place were found potsherds of a ware with geometric ornament, flakes and an Assyrian bead. All these finds establish a close connection be- tween the Khodzhaly monuments and Assyrian culture. In Kyzyl-Vank, Meshchaninov found remark- able polychrome ware with geometric ornaments, a mortuary chamber constructed of large slabs, obsidian arrowheads, stone agricultural imple- ments, and associated with them bronze and iron objects enabling him to attribute this burial to a lengthy period consisting of Bronze and Iron Ages. During 1938, IA.I Gummel has excavated in Kirkidzhan and Stepanakert. Bronze objects of fine workmanship from Kirkidzhan can be at- tributed to the transition period between the Bronze and Iron Ages, i.e, the beginning of the Urartian State at the beginning of the first mil- lennium B.c. The collective burial in Stepanakert Tumulus No. 103 belongs to an earlier period, probably the second millennium B.c. Other important pre-Urartian and Urartian monuments have been discovered in Armenia. B. B. Piotrovski and L. Zh. Giuzalian have made a thorough study of the Cyclopean fortresses in the northerly and northwestern slopes of Aragats Mountain from 1930-1932. Three groups of mon- uments were established: 1. Small citadels located on hilltops, usually accompanied by unwalled settlements on the sides and at the foot of the hill, and dated in pre-Urar- tian and Urartian Periods. Bronze Age burial grounds were usually found nearby. 2. Fortresses connected with definite cuneiform inscriptions, e.g., Kolagran, Nor-Bayazet, Atam- khan. 3. Fortress type settlements, forming true cit- ies, girded by archaic masonry walls enclosing groups of hills. The finds shed much light upon Khaldic move- ments in Trans-Caucasia, and particularly in Armenia. Of particular interest were such finds as obsidian flakes and implements, bronze objects and typical pottery, all these suggesting that dur- ing the Urartian period Trans-Caucasia was a rich and flourishing area populated by ancient tribes possessed of a highly developed, ancient, and original civilization. A new chapter in the history of the ancient Caucasus was uncovered by B. A. Kuftin's ex- cavations in Georgia. Dzhavakhishvili and A. N. Kalantadze had obtained a variety of finds, rep- resenting a wide range of periods, at the Samtavro burial ground near Mtskheti, where they re- opened work in 1938. The burials ranged from ordinary inhumations (end of second millennium B.C.), urn burials reminiscent of Palestine, and stone box burials. Pottery finds from Samtavro included low, round vessels covered with im- pressed geometric ornamentation and also a most interesting vessel with a bas-relief image of a serpent, which is strongly reminiscent of the "serpent houses " from Beth Shan in Palestine, and was probably intended for ritual use. Ground inhumations were characterized by bronze in- ventories: tweezers, rings, pins, and belts, decor- ated with animal effigies and geometric ornament. Many other important Bronze Age finds have been made elsewhere in Georgia. Thus, in 1930 there were found at Gostibe in Khartlia, Sassireti near Gori, and Anaga in Kakhetia, bronze axes,</page><page sequence="29">302 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY spear points, daggers, short swords, gravers, bridles, bracelets and rings, as well as small bronze animal effigies (bird figurines and the head of a goat). Many of these objects, attributed to the thirteenth century B.C., are closely related to typical Koban inventories. This establishes a close connection between the cultural and metal- lurgical centers of the Central Caucasus and Trans-Caucasia. Important archaeological finds in Georgia were made in Trialeti area (Khram Valley, Tsalka Raion) during the 1936-1940 excavations by B. A. Kuftin. The periods represented range from the Sasanian down to the middle of the second mil- lennium B.C., and, probably, older periods. To such earlier periods belong small flint knives and flint arrowheads. To the later period belong obsidian arrowheads of two types. A characteristic trait of this archaeological complex is the profusion of objects of obsidian and volcanic glass. Many interesting Bronze Age finds have also been made in Tsalka Raion. Thus, in burials at Beshtasheni inventories resembled the finds from the lower level of the Samtavro burial ground, but were apparently much older. Bronze objects included such objects as sickles, bridle pieces with hartshorn bits, dagger blades of Kobanian type, conical helmets, narrow belts, inserted spearheads, globular maces, and a small hammer, closely related to a similar object from Khodzhaly. Many of these objects are of unmistakable Koban type; others probably come from South Caucasian industrial centers. Further finds of great antiquity and interest have been made in the tumuli; there is no doubt that these are closely con- nected with the "basic culture of Western Asia." Of particular interest were such finds: a black- painted, spheroidal cup closely related to the most ancient Caucasian pottery from Kyzyl- Vank. This is also true of the large handleless vessels of hydria type decorated with a wavy- line ornament and bird effigies, which have anal- ogies in the second Elamite type. Rich inventories and many fine samples of jewellers' art were found in the younger group of tumuli. The following objects are typical for these burials: gold or silver drinking cup; gold fixtures from a standard; gold ornaments; large handleless clay vessels of the hydria or pithos types; urns were rarely encountered and included silver dagger blades, bronze spears, obsidian arrowpoints, and pottery decorated with the typical and yet dis- tinctive geometric ornament. The precious metal objects stand quite alone in form, sumptuousness, fine workmanship, very delicate chasing, filigree work and incrustation in precious stones, and are unique samples of the ancient Caucasian jewellers' art. Some of these objects are of exceptional historico-archaeological interest. Such is, for instance, a silver cup, decor- ated with a bas-relief representing a human figure seated on a throne attended by a single file pro- cession of figures-doubtless a ritual scene. Ac- cording to Kuftin, individual details of this scene, costumes, footwear, faces of figures, land- scape, trees, and the effigies of deer, permit this object to be compared with ancient Hittite and Egyptian motifs. Kuftin further points out a con- nection between the Tsalka jewels and the jewelry from the ancient Sumerian cities of Ur and Uruk (beginning of third millennium B.C. or older). Further study of the Tsalka Raion will shed additional light upon this complex problem. At the present time it may be stated that during the second millennium B.C. there existed in the Khram Valley in Georgia an original and highly developed ancient culture closely connected with the other ancient cultures of Asia Minor and northern Mesopotamia. The extensive historico-archaeological work of the last twenty-five years has yielded many valuable scientific discoveries. It is no longer possible to study the monuments of Caucasian antiquity without reference to the historico-cul- tural development of ancient Caucasian peoples. The linguistic vestiges, peculiar word forms and strange, grammatical forms surviving in ancient Caucasian languages enable us to draw definite conclusions pertaining to a Japhetic group - or stage-in the development of a large series of languages. At the same time this material, in connection with the studies of the rich native folklore, of the strong local artistic tradition, and highly developed material culture (e.g. bronze metallurgy), enables us to attempt a comprehen- sive study of the culture of the ancient dwellers in the Caucasus. Finally, it becomes obvious that beginning with the third millennium B.C. the en- tire Caucasian cultural world was closely con- nected with the cultural development of ancient Oriental peoples inhabiting Asia Minor, northern Mesopotamia, Syria, Iran, and during later per- iods, possibly even Egypt. Thus, it appears that the ancient Caucasus with its highly developed and original culture, was a part of a cycle of the great Oriental cultures.</page></plain_text>
