<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPRING 1987 Volume 39, Number 2 VOLKER DURR Personal Identity and The Idea of the Novel: Hegel in Rilke IN LAURENCE STERNE'S extraordinary novel Tristram Shandy (1759-67), the first-person narrator and a royal French commissary engage in a dialogue which reaches its enigmatically sparkling climax in this exchange: -My good friend, quoth I-as sure as I am I-and you are you- And who are you? said he.-Don't puzzle me; said I. (Book VII, chapter 33) As Shandean wit at its best, the innocent question and startling reply engender our immediate appreciation, yet a closer look at The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman reveals that the titular hero's puzzlement about his own identity transcends its seeming light-hearted- ness and constitutes one of the significant themes of the novel. For when we ask the narrator who he really is, we find among a number of simi- larly fashioned and comparably tempered answers this tragicomic one: "Sport of small accidents Tristram Shandy ! that thou art, and ever will be !" Indeed, because his identity has been imperiled since the most rudi- mentary beginnings of his self, the narrator decides to become an un- moved mover who spends the first two books of the novel literally in ovo and takes nearly half the narrative to bring himself-ill-conceived, maimed, and misnamed as he is-into the hostile world. Although Tristram Shandy, having prepared the stage for his own appearance, is a self-made impresario and a prompter of backstage in- trigues, his congenital trouble with the outside world reflects the fore- most concern of the novel since the eighteenth century: the relationship of the self with outer reality. The problem of the protagonist's personal identity, inextricably bound to the nature of the novel itself, remains 97</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE ubiquitous throughout the nineteenth century, finding perhaps its most radical solution in Rainer Maria Rilke's Malte Laurids Brigge (1910). The genre's preoccupation with personal identity is already evident in the titles of early novels, most of which consist of the names of individ- ual figures. And who are they? In contrast to Homeric heroes who are who they are even before the rhapsodist begins to recite the first episode, the protagonists of the novel are undefined and unknown. Everything has yet to be done for them. Undoubtedly Goethe had this very problem in mind when he began Die Wahlverwandtschaf ten (1809) with the hypothetical phrase, "Eduard-so nennen wir einen reichen Baron im besten Mannesalter." Since a name like Eduard or, for that matter, Eugenie Grandet, Oliver Twist, or Malte Laurids Brigge does not mean anything until much of the name-bearer's story has been told, the novel- ist has the task of endowing the chosen name with significance. Hence it is completely in keeping with the nature of the modern novel that the titular hero of Fielding's Tomn Jones (1749) is a foundling with a non- descript name, who has to define and prove himself in the course of the narrated events. Robinson Crusoe (1719), another archetypal work of the genre, deals directly with the same problem, for the protagonist identifies himself by writing his diary. Defoe's traits of Protestant in- dividualism and introspection make Robinson Crusoe the first novel that describes self-reflectively how a common man acquires a distinct iden- tity by shaping his world, and how he ultimately grows into a mythical figure embodying the concepts of isolation and self-reliance. Affirmative as their resolutions are, Robinson Crusoe and Tom Jones nevertheless illustrate the crucial dilemma of every serious traditional novelist. Whereas his aesthetic volition prompts him to create a well- rounded figure, this creative intent is counteracted by social reality, the very constitution of which opposes, as eighteenth-century novelists in- evitably perceived, the individual's aspiration to realize his potential. Thus, Fielding can only lead his narrative to a positive resolution be- cause his hero has neither large wants nor much of an inner life. Defoe displays similar insights. In order to transform his obscure sailor into a figure of real stature, he exiles Robinson from eighteenth-century soci- ety and places him on an uninhabited island. Here, the sheer will to survive forces him to perform the tasks of an epic life. Like Homer's Odysseus, Robinson builds his house with his own hands, tills the soil, and grows and prepares his food. Could there be a more explicit contrast to modern middle-class life where, as Robinson's father states, "men went silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of it"? Although the world of the middle class may, at times, be smooth and comfortable, it is rarely reassuring, for it tends to silence the self's ques- 98</page><page sequence="3">HEGEL IN RILKE tions about the meaning of things. Yet because external reality does undermine the individual's possibilities of realizing himself, the consti- tution of that reality has, at least since Hegel, played a decisive role in reflections on the nature of the novel. Hegel's views on art in general, and the novel in particular, must be seen in the context of the complete edifice of his thought, an edifice built upon the presupposition that the history of mankind is identical with the evolution of the human spirit in art, religion, and philosophy. In this process, which encompasses all that was, is, and will be, the spirit comes to actual consciousness of itself in its freedom, as it ultimately realizes itself as the Absolute, i.e. as Thought which thinks itself. The philosophy of art, then, constitutes the first cornerstone of this all-embracing system; its pendant is theology, and both are subsumed in the philosophy of philosophy. Because Hegel developed his Aesthetics when classical Greek art and literature "tyran- nized" Germany,1 it is only logical that he analyzed the criteria of the novel in juxtaposition with those of its classical antecedent. Like his contemporaries-whether they were Wieland, Goethe, or Schiller- Hegel perceived the modern genre as the sentimental, thoroughly self- conscious, and disadvantaged derivative of the Homeric epic: "Yet what [the novel] lacks is the poetic constitution of the ancient world from which the primary epic arose. The novel, according to its modern definition, indeed presupposes a reality ordered along prosaic princi- ples." Hence it is appropriate that "one of the most common collisions" in the-novel "is the conflict between the poetry of the heart and the opposing prose of conditions."2 It is clear that in Hegel's view the dialectical relationship between consciousness and the corporeal world had dramatically shifted to the disadvantage of the latter: external reality was no longer capable of gratifying the aspirations of the self. This discrepancy caused Hegel to look back to antiquity with nostalgia. According to his own conception of the evolution of the aesthetic con- sciousness (Hegel distinguished between symbolic art, classical art, and romantic art) it was in the second, classical stage that consciousness was able to objectify itself completely in the corporeal. As a result, mind and matter found their perfect union in form-for instance, in the sculptures of the Olympian Gods about which Hegel asserts: "There neither is, nor can there be anything more beautiful."3 In the Greek cosmos, con- sciousness was able to rediscover itself in the tangibly real, because the 1 See Eliza M.

In his luminous epics, Homer describes the daily interaction between gods and men, which endowed man with dignity and gave hin stature. As a permanent theo- dicy, the Homeric world was man's spiritual home where, according to imoira, he reaped what he deserved. It is generally acknowledged that writers in the highly self-conscious tradition of modern European literature, and in the German tradition in particular, have regarded the world of Homer, Aeschylus, and Sopho- cles as a Golden Age. They have sought to recapture its unity and tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to emulate its measured grandeur. Die Aufzeich- nungen des Malte Lactrids Brigge is undoubtedly one of the finest ex- amples of this kind of critical and creative encounter with the classical world. In this novel or "prose-book," as he chose to call it, Rilke amal- gamates various strains of Western literature, as well as figures from European history, and contrasts this modern aesthetic construct with a relic from antiquity, the amphitheater at Orange: Es wurde gespielt. Ein immenses, ein fibermenschliches Drama war im Gange, das Drama dieser gewaltigen Szenenwand, deren senkrechte Gliederung dreifach auf- trat, dr6hnend vor Gr6Be, fast vernichtend und pl6tzlich maBvoll im UbermaB. Ich lieB mich hin vor gliicklicher Bestiirzung. Dieses Ragende da mit der antlitz- haften Ordnung seiner Schatten, mit dem gesammelten Dunkel im Mund, be- grenzt, oben, von des Kranzgesimses gleichlockiger Haartracht: dies war die starke, alles verstellende antikische Maske, hinter der die Welt zum Gesicht zusam- menschoB. Hier, in diesem gro3en, einbezogenen Sitzkreis herrschte ein war- tendes, leeres, saugendes Dasein: alles Geschehen war driiben: G6tter und Schicksal. Und von driiben kam (wenn man hoch aufsah) leicht, fiber den Wand- grad: der ewige Einzug der Himmel. (pp. 921-922) (A play was on. An immense, a superhuman drama was in progress, the drama of that powerful backdrop, the vertical articulation of which appeared, tripartite, resonant with grandeur, annihilating almost, and suddenly measured in its sheer immensity. I sat down with a shock of amazed pleasure. This which towered be- fore me, with its shadows ordered in the semblance of a face, with darkness gathered in the mouth of its centre, bounded, up there, by the symmetrically curl- ing hairdress of the cornice: this was the strong, all-covering antique mask, be- hind which the world condensed into a face. Here, in this great incurved amphi- theatre of seats, there reigned a life of expectancy, void, absorbent: all happening was yonder: gods and destiny; and thence (when one looked, up high) came lightly, over the wall's rim: the eternal entry of the heavens.)

How could the modern mind not be intrigued by the fact that in its superhuman dimensions, the towering structure was "measured" and built on anthropomorphic norms? As the narrator realizes, this tripartite facade was "the strong, all-covering mask, behind which the world condensed into a face." Is the projection of human forms onto all that is, and the permeation of all that happens by human emotions not more than the modern mind can hope to accomplish ? The unity of the classical world rested on the anthropomorphic principle which was also the divine principle, for what were the Olympian Gods if not the quali- ties and attributes of man raised to perfection? It was this essential kin- ship that allowed Rilke to refer to the interaction between men and gods as "the eternal entry of the heavens," i.e. of the gods and fate, onto the stage at Orange where the very drama of being human was once per- formed. Yet the premise of this all-pervasive anthropomorphic principle, the perfect union of mind and matter, could not last, for according to Hegel it is the very nature of consciousness to strive upward out of the corpo- real. Consciousness, which must be restless and inquisitive until it suc- ceeds in returning into itself, broke through the limits of the self-con- tained Greek cosmos to realize itself on a higher level: heaven and earth were sundered. Malte's Aufzeichnungen, which can be read as an illus- tration of the Hegelian evolution of consciousness, depict the end of the unified classical world in a haunting image arising from the musings of a solitary scholar : Nun begreift er momentan die dynamische Bedeutung jener friihen Welteinheit, die etwas wie ein neues, gleichzeitiges Aufnehmen aller menschlichen Arbeit war. Es beirrt ihn nicht, daB jene konsequente Kultur mit ihren gewissermaBen vollzah- ligen Versichtbarungen fiir viele spatere Blicke ein Ganzes zu bilden schien und ein im Ganzen Vergangenes. Zwar ward dort wirklich des Lebens himmlische Hiilfte an die halbrunde Schale des Daseins gepa3t, wie zwei volle Hemispdiren zu einer heilen, goldenen Kugel zusammengehen. Doch dies war kaum geschehen, so empfanden die in ihr eingeschlossenen Geister diese restlose Verwirklichung nur noch als Gleichnis; das massive Gestirn verlor an Gewicht und stieg auf in den Raum, und in seiner goldenen Rundung spiegelte sich zuriickhaltend die Traurig- keit dessen, was noch nicht zu bewiiltigen war. (pp. 928-929) (Now he instantaneously grasps the dynamic significance of that early world- unity, which was something like a new and simultaneous assumption of all human work. It does not trouble him that that consistent civilization, with its almost total visualization, seemed to many later eyes to form a whole, and that whole wholly past. There, it is true, the celestial half of life was really fitted against the half- round bowl of terrestial existence, as two full hemispheres connect to form a per- fect orb of gold. Yet scarcely had this occurred, when the spirits confined within it felt this utter realization to be no more than allegory; the massive star lost weight and rose into space, and in its golden sphere the sadness was reflected, hesitant, of that which could not yet be mastered.) (pp. 201-202) 101</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE What is truly astounding about this passage is, of course, its complete congruence with Hegel's conception of the antique world, its art, and the end of its incomparable unity. Had Rilke really never read Hegel, as the lack of any evidence to this effect suggests ? Yet even if this were so, is it not likely that he had been exposed to Hegel's thought on art and history during his university years in Prague, Munich, and Berlin when Hegelians were manning the lecterns in the humanities? When, for in- stance, he attended the lectures of Kurt Breysig, a member of the Graecophile circle around the poet Stefan George? Or can it be ruled out that he was introduced to the Hegelian system in the salons or the gatherings of intellectuals he frequented? Whereas biographical evi- dence of this kind is desirable, the textual correspondences between the Aesthetics and Malte Laitrids Brigge speak for themselves. In both Rilke and Hegel the reduction of the Olympian Gods to mere allegories signifies the withdrawal of faith from everyday life and the end of the immnediate self-sufficiency of being. It also entails the end of that which Rilke calls the "almost total visualization" of classical cul- ture, since the disembodiment of the corporeal gods, their transfigura- tion into pure spirituality, and their removal into the infinite means that consciousness can no longer manifest itself adequately in the concrete. For Hegel all art on our side of this separation of heaven from earth is romantic art. It has as its content God, the Absolute, or pure conscious- ness. Regarding Hegel's distinction between classical and romantic art, it must be acknowledged that classical art is, aesthetically, the highest kind of art since it unites spiritual content and sensuous embodiment in harmonious accord. If, on the other hand, one considers the aesthetic consciousness as a historical stage in man's increasing awareness of the Absolute, romantic art is unquestionably the higher type, for it "repre- sents" the return of consciousness into itself. The return of conscious- ness into itself necessarily depreciates reality, which assumes the prosaic quality Hegel had recognized as the precondition for the emergence of the novel. For the novelist, this precondition raises a number of questions. How does the depreciation of the external affect a genre that must reflect the very constitution of corporeal and social reality ? How does the novel contend with the fact that now there are two worlds instead of one: the realm of the inner self, which is complete in itself, and that of the outside, which has been reduced to empty actuality? Of course the novel can and does concentrate on the inner life-the great emotions and subtlest stirrings of the soul, self-consciousness, and consciousness of the Abso- 5A comparable Hegelian reverberation, though with the Middle Ages as the exemplary age of unity, is found in the third volume of Hermann Broch's novel Die Schlafvwandler, particularly in the essays V-VIII. 102</page><page sequence="7">HEGEL IN RILKE lute-which distinguishes it most profoundly from the epic, which con- centrates on actions and deeds. Yet, whereas the transfer of all signifi- cant processes to the inner life expands the content of the novel far beyond the possibilities of the epic, tJhe novelist must nevertheless find means of representing his ideas concretely and of visualizing the spiri- tual life of his protagonist. Regarding this problem, Hegel proposes a seemingly paradoxical solution: "But for this very reason romantic art allows externality to again appear on its own account, and in this respect permits each and every matter to enter unhindered into representation. Even flowers, trees, and ordinary household furniture are admitted, and all of them in the natural accidentality of their mere existence." Yet such matter can only enter the novel, as Hegel notes, "when it is pervaded by human sensibility," and expresses "not merely the inner life, but in- ternality or subjectivity itself, which, instead of blending or fusing itself with the outer or material world, appears reconciled only in and with itself. Thus driven to extremity, the inner at this point becomes mani- festation destitute of externality.'"' The fact that romantic or modern art allows every kind of object and event into representation explains two of its most salient characteristics: the banal and the accidental. Both reflect the nature of modern exteri- ority, and they characterize the haphazard obstacles obstructing the paths of novelistic protagonists. At the same time, however, even the banal and accidental can become instruments of revelation, since their value derives from their relationship to the internality of the perceiving subject. This Hegelian claim is convincingly enacted in Hugo von Hof- mannsthal's Lord Chandos Letter (1902), where the author describes his "emptying" himself into insignificant creatures and objects, the en- counters with which provide essentially mystical illuminations, and in the novels of the twentieth century such as Sartre's La Nauske, in which a pebble, a piece of newspaper, and the root of a chestnut are invested with such revelatory power. It is a matter of course that the deprecia- tion of outer reality affects the protagonists of novels who become crea- tures of chance and victims of banality, or, as Tristram Shandy had al- ready observed, "sport (s) of small accidents." Behind them looms the broken promise of an epic life. The nineteenth century novel that displays this condition in a manner as explicit as it is elegiac is George Eliot's Middlemarch (1871-72), a genuine Bildungsromian. The "Prelude" to the novel compares the mod- ern heroine Dorothea Brooke to Saint Theresa, who wanted an "epic life" in order to reconcile "self-despair with the rapturous consciousness of life beyond self." Later-born Theresas, the author explains, cannot succeed in shaping "their thought and deed in noble agreement" since 6 Hegel, Vorlesungen iiber die A4sthetik, Vol. II, p. 140. 103</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE they are "hell)ed b)y no coherent faith and order which would perform the function of knowledge for the ardently willing soul." The prelude to Middleiarch is an epic simile for the novel as a whole. The tenor of the simile--hunger for an epic life beyond self and the quest for reform- advances the major thenmes of the novel, whereas the juxtaposition of the legendary and lmodern quester serves the dual purpose of establish- ing the heroine's ideal identity, and of disclosing the modern dilemma: "a certain spiritual grandeur ill matched with the meanness of oppor- tunity." The dense and banal nmedium of Middlemnarch-Hegel's depre- ciated externality-resists the projections of Dorothea Brooke's ideal self and reduces them to abstract notions. It also explains why some aspects of her personality, such as her shortsightedness and her flighty impetuosity, do not coalesce with its ideal side. The inevitable collision between her large wants and the pettiness of the provincial town shapes her life into a series of disillusioning commitnments and introspective self-assessments. Yet in spite of external adversity, Dorothea Brooke matures into an admirable woman. Admirable in defeat, that is, for her constructive impulses and her energy are broken up and channeled into many small outlets. The course of events restricts the modern quester to a "hidden life," the effects of which on those around her are "incal- culably diffusive." The fate of George Eliot's heroine exemplifies the results of novelistic endeavors to probe the self's possibilities in a contemporary setting. Thus, even the Bildungsroman, the genre which set out to demonstrate that the spiritual needs of the self can be gratified by the offerings of the outside world, grudgingly gives in to the overwhelming forces of the "real." The utopian ending Goethe was forced to graft onto the first five "realistic" books of Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre in order to rescue the titular hero foreshadows the conclusions of subsequent Bildungsromane, all of which fail to overcome the discrepancy between the poetry of the heart and the prosaic constitution of externality. Novels which concen- trate on the inner life of their protagonists, placing them amidst the social conditions of their time, arrive without exception at tragic or cynical resolutions of this conflict. Flaubert's L'Education sentimentale is a case in point. The sham public life of this anti-Bildu ngsroman par excellence disorients the indecisive protagonist, consumes his energies, and disillusions him. Frederic Moreau neither finds a vocation nor ac- quires a character. Instead, the world given him erodes his being, and time-the relentless procurer of disillusionment-hollows him out. The disheartening history of the novel does not lack irony, for while the genre displayed ever greater formal and technical accomplishments, its substantive raison d'8tre as the medium describing the individual's development has become more and more questionable. The individual, 104</page><page sequence="9">HEGEL IN RILKE whom the historical process had freed from religious orthodoxy, eco- nomic and political tutelage of the aristocracy, and class restrictions, was gradually succumbing to the impersonal forces it had unchained in its struggle for self-determination. Thus the individual found himself in a world even less conducive to the realization of his potential. As a conse- quence, the very forces threatening his identity began to replace the names of individuals as the titles of novels: Le Rouge et le Noir, Vanity Fair-A Novel without a Hero, Geld und Geist, Soll und Haben, Mid- dlemiarch, War and Peace, L'Argent, Le Ventre de Paris, Das Schlo/3. If the history of the novel through the nineteenth century supports Hegel's conception of romantic art, Malte Laurids Brigge not only il- lustrates the crucial transition from the classical to the romantic phase, but also dramatizes one of the last stages of the romantic consciousness in a twentieth-century setting. Since this last stage, in which conscious- ness returns into itself, is a period of inwardness, its most appropriate literary medium is a particular kind of poetry: the lyrical mode. This Hegelian contention makes it all the more significant that Rilke, who had begun Malte Laiurids Brigge in the third person, finally decided on a first person narrator speaking in the voice of the modern lyrical self. The simultaneous change to the form of Aufzeichnungen, a vehicle of self-portraiture resembling the literary diary, allowed the lyrical self to concentrate completely on rendering its impressions, inner states, and projections-i.e. to represent itself as if it were Hegel's subjective spirit -without having to translate the contents of consciousness into a con- trived or banal plot. The formal result of Rilke's diary-technique is a kaleidoscopic succession of vignettes which display a chaotic world and the disoriented protagonist seeking to come to terms with himself and his surroundings. The preconditions of the literary diary are isolation, crisis, and the will to art,7 criteria that accurately describe Malte. They also character- ize the protagonists of two subsequent literary diaries: Roquentin in Sartre's novel La Nausde (1938) and, to a lesser extent, Meursault in Camus's L'?tranger (1946). Malte Laurids Brigge and these two later works reverse, if not parody, the nineteenth-century idea that the novel ought to portray an individual's development into a representative per- sonality or a social type, for they are no longer concerned with the tradi- tional notion of personality. Quite the contrary, the protagonist of the Notebooks and the main characters of its successor novels are conceived to unmask society, to un-make themselves, and to give their lives new directions. In this respect, Malte's fate signals the end of the humanist tradition in the European novel.8 7 Albert Griiser, Das literarische Tagebuch (Saarbriicken, 1955), pp. 99-107. s In this context it does not matter whether one thinks of Goethe's definitions of 105</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Malte begins the diary with his arrival in Paris, where he is a for- eigner without acquaintances." He has, moreover, cut his ties with his past, and broken with the values and conventions of his background. Recalling the p1erforation of his father's heart, Malte states: Aber nun war der Jigermeister tot, und nicht er allein. Nun war das Herz durch- bohrt, unser Herz, das Herz unseres Geschlechts. Nun war es vorbei. Das war also das Helmzerbrechen: "Heute Brigge und nimmermehr," sagte etwas in mir. An mein Herz dachte ich nicht. Und als es mir spfiter einfiel, wuite ich zum erstenmal ganz gewifl, dal3 es hierfilr nicht in Betracht kam. Es war ein einzelnes Herz. Es war schon dabei, von Anfang anzufangen. (p. 855) (But now the Master-of-the-Hunt was dead, and not he alone. Now the heart had been pierced, our heart, the heart of our race. Now it was all over. This, then, was the shattering of the helm: "Today Brigge and nevermore," something said with- in me. Of my own heart I did not think. But when it occurred to me later, I knew for the first time quite certainly that for this purpose it did not come into question. It was an individual heart. It was already at its task of beginning from the be- ginning.) (pp. 139-140) His father, Malte recognizes, had wanted certainty: certainty about his own death, and certainty about the end of the dynastic line, for he knew that his only son was in no position to continue the family tradition. With the assertion, "today Brigge and nevermore," Malte leaves behind everything he was by right of the social class into which he had been born. Reduced to his "non-contingent" self, the overwhelming experi- ence of the megalopolis Paris blots out his character traits. Thereafter "personality" or "character" or, for instance, of Balzac's method of building a novelistic figure as formulated by Taine. As the describer of one of the last stages of Hegel's romantic consciousness dramatized in the Notebooks, Malte not only demonstrates the un-making of the traditional notion of the individual personality, but he also shows how his expanded, supra-personal consciousness approximates the Absolute. In this respect he enacts the end of a tradition, for there is, as far as its ideal content is concerned, no way of surpassing Rilke's novel. But if Malte Laurids Brigge constitutes the end of a tradition, it also signals a completely new beginning, i.e. that of the twentieth-century novel. Wilhelm Emrich, Walter Jens, and Ulrich Ffilleborn have emphasized this aspect of the novel in their studies. To be sure, they differ in their accentuation of its problematic aspects, yet all three agree in their claims that it stands at the inception of anti-realist modernism in fiction. Jens's observations stress the new independence of "speaking things"; Em- rich makes the paradoxical claim that Malte is determined by "all that is," although "all that is" does not command the forces of fate; and Fiilleborn, finally, under- lines the seminal significance of the Notebooks as a first-person narrative at the opening of the twentieth century.

Helpless, totally unprepared, and-because of his lack of an identity- utterly exposed to the onslaught of the mechanized pandemonium of Paris with its odious sights, sounds, and smells, the intimate gestures of the social outcasts, the outcries of the abused-"Ah, tais-toi, je ne veux plus"-and the ubiquitous phenomena of death, Malte Laurids Brigge dwindles into even less than a blank sheet of paper: "I sit here," he de- clares, "and am nothing" (p. 28). Remarkable about all these experiences is their accidental nature, which Hegel had perceived as characteristic of modern art. Yet since the accidental has become typical, Malte's experiences are necessary, inevitable, and real; and they conspire to destroy him. Nevertheless, starved for "reality," he opens himself up masochistically to the assault of this alien world which is as vicious as it is banal, and he describes his sensations with a psychological realism that makes it impossible to dis- tinguish between his consciousness and its objects. The prose of these diary entries is as spare and intense as that of Gustave Flaubert's Trois Contes and Charles Baudelaire's Petits Po'ines en prose. Malte Laurids Brigge refers to both authors as exemplary; in the course of the prose- book they emerge as his mentors regarding the subject matter and realistic style of the opening sections of the Aufzeichnungen. Malte's attitude is that of Flaubert-a student of Hegel's works-who ex- pressed his creative approach to empirical reality in a letter of July 8, 1853, to Louise Colet : ". ..for external reality must enter us and almost make us cry out with it, if we are to reproduce it well."'0 This method of apprehending the empirically real, or the actual, re- calls the conviction of certain sectarians that the overcoming of sin requires complete immersion in sin until, oversaturated, the sinner is able to rise above its spell, its initial fascination. Thus reality "must enter us and almost make us cry out with it" so that the artist can repre- sent it accurately and redeem it through form. The kind of reality with which Flaubert is preoccupied turns the vocation of the writer into self- denial since it is, quite like the objects Malte Laurids Brigge encounters, totally inimical: ... j'ai la vie ordinaire en execration. Je m'en suis toujours personnellement &amp;carte autant que j'ai pu. Mais esthetiquement, j'ai voulu, cette fois, et rien que cette fois, la pratiquer au fond.

Therefore I plunged into it heroically, into all its minutiae, accepting everything, telling everything, depicting everything, pretentious as that may sound.) 11 There can be no doubt that Rilke detested ordinary life no less than Flaubert-he did prefer the castles and chateaus of the European aris- tocracy to bourgeois boarding houses-yet in Malte Laurids Brigge he too exposes his protagonist to sordidness and squalor at the risk of annihilation ("accepting everything, telling everything"). For Malte, the encounter with the "Real" is a test he has to stand in order to sur- vive. Therefore he embraces the actual as a necessity and affirms it at the occasion of his reference to Baudelaire's poem "Une Charogne": Es war seine Aufgabe, in diesem Schrecklichen, scheinbar nur Widerwartigen das Seiende zu sehen, das unter allem Seienden gilt.

Es kommt mir vor, als ware das das Entscheidende: ob einer es iiber sich bringt, sich zu dem Aussditzigen zu legen ... Glaube nicht, daB ich hier an Enttiiuschungen leide, im Gegenteil. Es wundert mich manchmal, wie bereit ich alles Erwartete aufgebe fuir das Wirkliche ... (pp. 775-776) (It was his task to see in this terrible thing, seeming to be only repulsive, that existence which is valid among all that exists. Choice or refusal there was none. Do you imagine it was by chance that Flaubert wrote his Saint-Julien-1'Hos- pitalier ? This, it seems to me, is decisive: whether a man can bring himself to lie beside a leper ... But do not imagine I am suffering disappointments here-quite the contrary. I marvel sometimes how readily I give up every thing I expected for reality... ). (pp. 68-69) The indiscriminate acceptance of all that is, which Rilke sees as the premise of Baudelaire's and Flaubert's seminal accomplishments, leads directly back to Hegel's observation that romantic art permits "each and every matter to enter unhindered into representation." At the lower end of Hegel's series of objects such matter consists of household furniture; for Malte Laurids Brigge, who characterizes the "horrible and repul- sive" as "that existence which is valid among all that exists" (p. 67), the actual, which is unspeakably horrible, includes slimy walls, open sewers, and rotting limbs. A festering wound, a carcass, anything and everything is, if one fol- lows Hegel's assertion to its logical conclusion, fit to be the subject of poetry. Accordingly, Flaubert proposes in one of his letters: "Let us extract poetry from wherever we can, for it is present everywhere and 11 Flaubert, letter to Laurent-Pichat of October 2, 1856. 108</page><page sequence="13">HEGEL IN RILKE anywhere.'"'1 On another occasion he writes that poetry is purely sub- jective, 'that in literature there are no such things as beautiful sub- jects ..., one can write about one thing equally well as about any other. The artist must raise everything to a higher level."'" If, indeed, every- thing is suited to be the subject of poetry, it is equally true that nothing is an adequate subject. What matters is the artistic consciousness that wrests transitory and ephemeral phenomena from the flux of actuality and recreates them into revealing images. In order to apprehend the actual, the artist-on whom everything depends-must fling himself into the depreciated corporeal, for only then can reality "enter into us" and "make us cry out with it." As a child, Malte had already experienced such depersonalization when he fell unconscious as the result of con- fronting the mirror. He "lay there like a piece of something among those wrappings, just like a piece of something" (p. 96). In Paris, this sensa- tion repeats itself in his encounters with the social outcasts or "husks of humanity that fate has spewed out" (p. 743). Stuck to walls, lamp-posts, or trickling down alleys, they are almost indistinguishable from their material background, as for instance the old newspaper vendor whose hand is wearing away on the stone coping. Is it surprising that Malte confesses to feeling kinship with these outcasts, while they, in turn, recognize him as one of their own? Like Saint-Julien-l'Hospitalier he perceived them as a task-eine Aufgabe-i.e. as something that has been entrusted to him, for these extreme figures of human misery are real, and in their reality they, too, are part of the Absolute which encom- passes everything. "My God, it struck [Malte] with vehemence, so in- deed you are. There are proofs of your existence." But what is the task of the artist Malte? He himself provides the answer, just after he has declared himself to be "nothing," for "this nothing" suddenly has the intuition that "one has not yet seen, known or said anything real and important," that "despite discoveries and progress, despite culture, religion and world-wisdom, one has remained at the surface of life," and that "the whole history of the world has been misunderstood" (pp. 28-29). In this, then, the isolated foreigner sees his vocation: he must write, and he must begin at the beginning. His resolution to review the interpreted world is tantamount to a decision to re-constitute himself. Thus the Hegelian dialectic of consciousness and the external world is once more set into motion. In order to express its innermost convictions, the lyrical self must of course employ words designating something. Here the difficulties begin, for like Henrik Ibsen whose noble failure as a dramatist he deplores, Malte must find "equivalents among the visible for the inwardly seen" 12 Flaubert, letter to Louise Colet of March 27, 1853. 13 Flaubert, letter to Louise Colet of June 26, 1853. 109</page><page sequence="14">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE (p. 76). Ibsen failed in his efforts to find outward equivalents for his thoughts and feelings-to approximate, in other words, the total visuali- zation that antiquity had accomplished-because life in his day "had withdrawn inward, so deeply that it was scarcely possible to conjecture about it anymore" (pp. 75-76). It is clear that the case of Ibsen illus- trates Hegel's romantic consciousness which surpasses the representa- tional possibilities of the corporeal world. Compared with Ibsen's situa- tion, Malte's predicament is aggravated by the fact that outer reality not only refuses to yield equivalents, but has become an actively hostile force. Therefore Malte reacts to the prose of outward conditions by turning inward, for consciousness can, as Hegel claimed, only be com- pletely itself in itself. After its initial state as mere "soul" and its con- sciousness of itself in empirical objects, the subjective (and aesthetic) spirit is about to reach its final stage. With the imaginative evocation of his personal past, the Notebooks become a toutr de force of Malte's creative intelligence. "I asked for my past," he writes, "and it has come back, and I feel that it is just as diffi- cult as it was before." Difficult? Of course, as it becomes evident that his helplessness in Paris is largely due to the fact that he has not come to terms with the anxieties of his formative years. "Creature of fear and anxieties Malte Laurids Brigge," the Shandean parodist would right- fully say. Yet in the face of the even more harrowing experience of Paris, Malte does eventually express, aesthetisize, and thereby neutralize all that happens to him in the megalopolis. There is still another reason for his turning to his personal past. The feudal setting of his native Den- mark represented a world of individualism and dignity where everyone had, for instance, his own death. It is also a world as wholly past as the whole of antiquity. Nevertheless, by juxtaposing it with the mass- society of Paris and its mass-production of death, the writer Malte demonstrates the mutual exclusiveness and limited validity of these two contrary ways of "life." The principal reason for their obvious incompatibility lies in Malte's act of deleting several hundred years of socio-political development by moving directly from the feudal society of his childhood to one of the major urban centers of the twentieth century. The world he leaves out is, of course, that of the middle-class and the bourgeoisie which had not only generated the traditional novel, but also mediated in history be- tween the aristocratic order and modern mass society. Whether one calls Malte's method das Gesetz der Komnplemnentaritdit or the principle of polarity,14 the result is much the same. His childhood memories and his Parisian experiences cancel each other out. 14 I refer to the study by Ulrich Fiilleborn cited above as well as to Walter Seifert, Das epische Werk Rainer Maria Rilkes (Bonn, 1969). 110</page><page sequence="15">HEGEL IN RILKE In order to begin at the beginning, Malte delves more deeply into the past by regressing into history, legend, and myth from which he recalls personae that at one time or other impressed themselves upon his con- sciousness. He reinterprets these figures as embodiments of the great themes of the Notebooks such as love and death, misery, exaltation, and metamorphosis, and arranges them in series and complementary pairs as well as dialectical polarities. Altogether they combine into a mosaic- like landscape of consciousness which enacts once more the Hegelian evolution of the spirit, and with which the protagonist and quester can also identify. In the process of these reinterpretations and projections, time is inverted and the past becomes Malte's future. In the tapestries of the Lady with the Unicorn the intent of the rein- terpretations becomes transparent. The six Gobelins, which were a gift of a French nobleman to his fiancee, depict a maiden's festive prepara- tions for marriage. In their traditional order, i.e. the order in which they are arranged at the Cluny Museum in Paris, the first tapestry por- trays the lady showing the unicorn its image in a mirror, whereas the last displays a marriage tent. Critics have noted that Rilke changed the sequence of the tapestries, but they have failed to provide convincing explanations for their rearrangement.15 In the Notebooks, the tapestry with the marriage tent is placed fourth, followed by one which, accord- ing to the text, seemingly depicts the lady in mourning. Is Rilke's impli- cation not clear? The marriage will not be consummated, a conjecture confirmed by the last tapestry in Malte Laurids Brigge, which is the first of the traditional sequence: the lady is showing the unicorn its image in a mirror. This scene can be interpreted as innocence reflecting and preserving itself. In the larger context of the A ufzeichnungen it also signifies that consciousness is turning inward or, as Hegel would have it, returning upon itself. "Expectation plays no part" in the final scene, Malte asserts. "Everything is here. Everything forever" (p. 113). The love of the Lady with the Unicorn no longer has any expectations, for it does not involve a "Thou." Like all the unloved lovers Malte in- troduces-Abelone, Bettine, Gaspara Stampa, the Portuguese nun, HeIloise, and Sappho-who outgrew the man they loved and "mourned not for any man who had left [their] embrace empty, but for the one, no longer possible, who had grown equal to [their] love" (p. 202), the Lady with the Unicorn transforms her love into an intransitive, con- tinuous activity, a direction. A verbal modification of Friedrich Schle- gel's "love without an object,"'' Malte's concept of love becomes a 15 See also Egon Olessak, ed., Raicer Maria Rilke-Die Dame mit dem Ein- horn (Frankfurt a.M., 1978). 16 In the chapter "Lehrjahre der Mdinnlichkeit" of Friedrich Schlegel's novel Lucinde (1799) the term still has a negative connotation: "Eine Liebe ohne Gegen- stand brannte in ihm und zerrfittete sein Inneres." 111</page><page sequence="16">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE movement toward pure consciousness, toward the Absolute. The pre- condition of this radical re-orientation is the metamorphosis of the lover into a potentiality whose essence can only realize itself in the quest for the Absolute. Whereas love arrests the beloved in his or her facticity, the act of loving prompts the transcendence of the self. The concepts of metamorphosis and transcendence, which the un- loved lovers personify and enact, unite into the great theme of the Note- books. Its variations are too numerous to be analyzed separately; in- stead, the striking examples of Charles the Bold and Grishka Otrepioff shall serve as illustrations of the idea underlying all of them. Their com- mon bond consists of their respective attempts to outreach their grasp: the Duke of Burgundy coveted the imperial German crown, Otrepioff sought to become Tsar. The similarity between the two fictionalized historical characters does not, however, extend beyond their political ambition and ultimate failure, for as types they represent polarities. Charles the Bold, who was "all his life long one and the same, hard and unalterable as granite" (p. 164), is obviously conceived as a prisoner of his own individuality. Since he was incapable of transcending himself, Malte represents him as a doomed man who did not believe in his mis- sion. In death he was nothing but a duke's somewhat too conspicuous finery: a husk without a face and without "reality." In contrast, the false tsar did not possess an individuality, but was a potentiality with an unlimited belief in himself and his ability to become and to be everything. For this reason, Malte states, Otrepioff made a mistake in summoning the tsarina-mother, for it "lifted him out of the fulness of his inventions; it limited him to a weary imitation; it reduced him to the individual he was not; it made him an imposter" (p. 163). Yet his will to transform himself into that which he desired to be was so strong that for three days after his death his face was still expressing the role he had assumed. Is it not ironical that his executioners pierced through his night-shirt in order to strike "the hard core of a person- ality" (p. 164) ? In the figure of Grishka Otrepioff, Malte shows the self's potential for change, for which he himself had been striving ever since his arrival in Paris. The motif-like phrase, "I am learning to see," which opens the fifth paragraph of the Notebooks, prepares the statement that Malte is "changing" (p. 15). His reinterpretations and projections of the figures with whom he identifies chart his new course. Appropriately, these his- torical figures depersonalized themselves in order to become incarna- tions of transcendent attitudes. Thus Malte, too, divests himself of his personal identity-a conception that has become obsolete in his under- standing of the order of things-to become a comprehensive conscious- ness which encompasses all that is, from the "husks of humanity" to the 112</page><page sequence="17">HEGEL IN RILKE aged women "grown hard, but with a kernel of savoriness which they [keep] hidden"; and from the classical amphitheater at Orange to the Brotherhood of the Passion. Upon gaining the ability of Bettine Brentano to surrender completely to the external world without disintegrating, or the completeness of Charles VI-a synthesis of all historical figures in that he embodies love, misery, and change-Malte Laurids Brigge will become the instru- ment of the absolute spirit, of thought thinking itself: "But there will come a day when my hand will be far from me, and when I bid it write, it will write words I do not mean. The time of that other interpretation will dawn, when not one word will remain upon another . . . But this time I shall be written. I am the impression that will change" (p. 52). Moving even further back into the past, Malte concludes the Note- books with yet another reinterpretation-this time of a mythical figure -which represents the highest metaphorical possibility of his self. For in contrast to the Duino Elegies where, as Erich Heller has shown, everything is and remains internalized, invisible and inexpressible as the fulfillment of a Hegelian prophecy,'7 the Notebooks project such possibilities outward as visible equivalents. The reinterpretation of the parable of the Prodigal Son surely is the boldest creative achievement of the diary. This decisive reassessment has been prepared by the intro- duction of the unloved lovers and by a conjecture regarding Otrepioff : "I am not disinclined to believe that the strength of his transformation lay in his no longer being anybody's son. (This, in the end, is the strength of all young people who have gone away)" (p. 162). Quite fittingly Malte sees the Prodigal Son as one who also left home because he did not want to be loved. And with him Malte completely identifies. The equation of his own development with that of the reinterpreted biblical figure turns the adventures of his consciousness into a paradigm of man's fate in our time. Flung into a hostile world, puzzled, dis- oriented, assaulted, and as isolated in contemporary mass-society as Robinson Crusoe on his uninhabited island, Malte Laurids Brigge is the Prodigal Son of the twentieth century. But in contrast to Robinson, who identifies himself through deeds and grows into a genuine mythical figure, the modern protagonist Malte defines his self by identifying with a myth. Would he be puzzled if Laurence Sterne's commissary asked him who he was ? Undoubtedly! But, then, no royal French commissary of the eighteenth century would be prepared for the Hegelian answer. By telling the biblical parable-and thereby his own parable in the third person-Malte, the modern lyrical self, at last succeeds in ob- jectifying his inwardness. In his version of the parable, moreover, he 17 See Erich Heller, The Artist's Journcy into the Intcrior and Othcr Essays (New York, 1968). 113</page><page sequence="18">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE p1rovides a most subjective interpretation of a communal myth, i.e. of an expression of the "objective spirit," and thus fuses the two kinds of spirit Hegel distinguishes and synthesizes in the Absolute. Hence Malte is finally able to begin his "long love to God" who, however, "was not yet willing." "Quo vadis, Malte Laurids Brigge ?" In Hegel's triadic system of aesthetics, theology, and )philosol)hy Malte has, at the conclusion of the iufzeichnlungen, left the realm of aesthetics and is about to become a Hegelian theologian.
