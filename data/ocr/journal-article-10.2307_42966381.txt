<plain_text><page sequence="1">224 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY Adrian Stokes and the Benignity of Form: Part Two In art the formal elements always bring of themselves a beneficent content: that is why any fear, any misery, any madness, become bearable if they are projected by an aesthetic process. {The Impact of Architecture) 1 though less faisandé in style than, say, The Stones of Rimini , the prose of Smooth and Rough (1951) is often so concentrated that at times it seems almost to leave plain prose quite behind it. I think this is because Stokes' language seeks to enact the union of 'logic' and 'fantasy' that the book values and recommends - the blame for any ensuing 'difficulty' should not be laid at the door of Melanie Klein and psycho-analytic 'jargon'. For Stokes, psycho-analysis was a means of sharpening his aesthetic perceptions, an aid to clarity of discourse, though he was well aware of the way that criticism had often made it a pretext for being confoundingly knowing about the mind. Thus the 'Foreword' to Smooth and Rough , which is a deeply meditative book, has a polemical flourish: As the theories, for instance, put forward by apologists of Sur- realism so strongly suggest, it seems questionable whether anyone connected with the arts has shown himself thoroughly habituated to the climate of psycho-analytic thought.1 Stokes intends no fantastic geologising of the unconscious (an all- too-conscious game) nor any reduction back of art to some psycho- analytical explanation of the artist which discounts form: 'A noisy weapon has been put in the hands of the trite disputant.' His ambi- tion is bolder as well as subtler, to seek for nothing less than a new 'humanism' which, in the book's closing words, 'since the advent of psycho-analysis . . . may begin, very, very slowly, to be effective'. My ears pricked up at that, as at something worth trying to understand though possibly hard of belief. The book begins from a picture of Stokes' war years, as a market gardener in Cornwall and a somewhat pensive functionary of the Home Guard. This focus is not primarily anecdotal: the war, ultimate experience of division and loss, becomes in later allusions as much symbol as event. The vivid evocation of Stokes' war- work in 1 Unless otherwise stated all quotations from Stokes are from The Critical Writings of Adrian Stokes , ed. Lawrence Gowing (Thames and Hudson, 1978).</page><page sequence="2">ADRIAN STOKES: TWO 225 fact serves to impress a feeling that the nightmare war is only a temporary intrusion into the more ancient rhythms of Cornish life. Unlike the sea, the war can only symbolise negative, persecutory fragments of the mind: 'The sporadic tides of war were super- imposed upon ceaselessness. The sea-noise, often only a murmur, threaded those years.' The heavily transient burden of war could thus still lift to divulge another, less stricken bond with the outer world, a no longer submerged 'sense of home': I remember sitting late in the empty St Ives station with a friend, waiting, as we thought, for a train by which his wife might arrive from a cross-country journey. We realized later that no further train would čome that night. We looked out to sea, warm and comfortable. The war was then three days old: we attempted to identify the stars, to transfer to them the fixity which had been lost to the circumstances of living. Galaxies hung over Godrevy light- house, something steadfast, as it were, from the sea (if only because sailors consulted them) as well as from the sky. The immense tale of light-years dwarfed the duration of the nightmare war that lay ahead. Beneath the open sky the future of our own lives moved in the darkness of the waves. But, oh yes, there were the points, the promontories of the bay: it would be as well to write a letter to so-and-so . . . The wry, poignant humour which tempers the thoughtfulness of this seems to be saying: However awful this nightmare disruption is it can only be a disruption because the 'points' of the bay it threatens it cannot destroy; someone, something, will have the last laugh on the uncouthly tragic intrusion. The humour of the resigned letter-writer is a sort of tough faith in things. Railway timetables and aeroplanes are also diminished by an awareness of the 'ageless St Ives generations' among whom the Home Guard Stokes takes up his transient role of watcher of the cliffs and sea. This watching does not mean that he has merely stationed himself for the duration of the war in a kind of natural Ivory Tower, though the natural world of the two-and-a-half acre smallholding that he 'rarely went outside' for six years did offer him a place of positive retreat (as nature probably did Cézanne as well). To conceive of himself as a kind of guárdian of the landscape was less evasion than a way of sustaining the ideal of 'object-otherness' which all his work had served. Perhaps a vocation for humanism could only be conserved during those years by maintaining a certain detachment from the years themselves? What is clear is that Stokes had brought from Italy, currently an enemy power, a gift for belong- ing to the world rather than any feelings of cosmopolitan exile. If his references to the war lack the combatant's note of hatred and com-</page><page sequence="3">226 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY passion it is because he felt, like Lawrence in the Great War, that there could be no scapegoats or heroes in a war which dramatised the contaminations of the entire culture of the 4 Machine- Age'. The war represented a reality it would be death to settle for; it must not be construed as a measure and index of human potential. To think beyond it was to seek reparation of its ultimate 'Romantic agony'. If Italian landscape taught Stokes 'the weight and calm of measured things' London had offered only 'the affliction of endless purlieus and mapless terraces': it had done so 'long before the war or wars'. Thus, the threat of destruction to its older horror of 'Victorian squalor and splendour' mixes shock with the 'psychological relief' of finding that there is 'a decided limit to our national wealth'. It is from this sense of a continuity of horror in both peace and war that Stokes can still contemplate, with undeviating passion and despite the war, the 'ill-starred' Thames at Waterloo Bridge and see its slimy water stir images of the intercourse of stone and water which reflect, like those he had received in Venice, 'the other half of life, the world of sleep and of the incorporated figures that we rock within us, the overlapping, the underlapping, the outside-in'. Yet the noise of London traffic muffles the echoing of our internal objects in the outer world: 'With unexpected dignity a fleck of plaster falls from a villa in St John's Wood. Trees in the villa garden are safely rooted, attentive to the wind. Churned, hoed, snipped by each successive vehicle, our roots remain unknown'. The tone is subtler and more sorrowful than anger, gentle and unreprovingly adamant in its con- viction: it takes aim not just at an external and aesthetic ugliness but at something less avoidable by moral gesturing, an inner spiritual numbness that, uncountered, would leave us no recourse but to 'emptiness and perhaps to ancient grief'. To wax furious about motor cars would, in a way, be to collaborate in the noise by which they distract us from our 'roots'. If there is a prophetic impetus behind Stokes' imagination it issues not in any quest for consolation through prophetic visions of change but in an appeal to a humanness that has been and still, come what may, always is a possible good. He wants to change human nature, that is, only by recovering it. Stokes regards the impoverished stock of corporeal imagery to be gleaned from the modern city as diminishing our prospects of mental health and beauty in one and the same breath. Such a culture parallels the state of those psychotic patients of Melanie Klein's who were unable to think or play symbolically. Klein, whose analytic technique was based on the symbolic reading of the play of her child patients, had departed from Freud in suggesting that the faculty of symbolisation actually precedes and nourishes the capacity for sub- limation. This idea was of central importance to the Stokes whose feeling for the emblematic qualities of 'Quattro Cento' art was very</page><page sequence="4">ADRIAN STOKES: TWO 227 much an expression of needs he found uncatered for by the more meagre iconography of modern art. Smooth and Rough defines this modern disparity of inner and outer as a want of sane and whole body-images, capable of projection outwards by what he calls the 'body-ego'. That is, it is the degree of corporeal richness in the iconography of a work of art, its ability to disclose what is inner as outward form, which determines its capacity for catharsis. An essen- tial (and also Kleinian) characteristic of such catharsis is therefore its grateful recognition of those inner forces it transmutes. They go back, of course, to childhood. To Stokes one of the ironic paradoxes of his parents' Victorian culture lay in its repression or senti- mentalising of the childhood it began by celebrating. For whereas a stifling of the inner child in ourselves will only prolong infantile responses a true adulthood requires its recognition: Ceaseless seas of experience construct the coral mind . . . Children in their play regiment or propitiate the inner figures to which love, hate, guilt and and anxiety refer. We partake of whom and of what we love, of whom we abhor no less. All grief, all joy, are older than their context. Children play out their inner life: the adult acts with concealing grandeur childhood's script. That the child is father to the man does not asperse nor qualify adulthood. The candle of reason, brighter, steadier, longer than heretofore, discloses a nearer and more active darkness: we are ringed by emotion. As sun to sea, something of reason only, a measurement, the foreseen course of the stars, gives surface polish to opaque depths. We are whales who come up to spew into the lovely air of light. How much pure unsolemn pleasure there is in the way that last sentence enacts its twin-faith in reason and fantasy. The buoyant, almost sportive, outcome of the passage's oracular seriousness rules out any manic chant to libido or any Romantic child- worship: it enjoins not some oceanic regression but a free and blithe admission of our former selves to ourselves. Stokes' plea is that we look the psy- chological facts in the face and not romanticise them, for 'the distant and original rough homes of all men's feelings never fail to send their messages, garbled, and even sometimes reversed in transit, and to exert their power upon the palatial colonies'. We keep our hold on these precarious colonies of adulthood only by keeping replenished, from the impulses which planted them, the 'precious top-soil of conscious life'. This process of replenishment is not, of course, conscious in the sense of being cerebral and willed: The corollary to logic is fantasy. Consciousness combines closely the sense of fact and of emotional substitutes or symbols. We</page><page sequence="5">228 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY cannot, through emotional discernment, proceed behind myth which appears, therefore, both to obscure and to represent 'deep' reality. We cannot go beyond myth, beyond art, in wide emotional discernment, to some revealing state that is more precise, more particular, less the product of distortion . . . We are all Sunday painters, subtle naifs bound to childhood and culture. 4 Myth', a psychic imagery that at its source is also corporeal, is the only bridge we can throw between childhood and adulthood, fantasy and fact. Incorporated into art it can make our aesthetic values our human values too, for, rightly, the two kinds of value should be indivisible. In Smooth and Rough Stokes is even less prepared than for- merly to work within the intellectual confines of art criticism: the tone of the book is nearer, in its elated gravity, to religious medita- tion. Characteristically, Stokes couches his high valuation of adulthood in architectural terms: 'conscious life' is not merely a 'thin, ramshackle deck' that is 'planted on top of romantic wildness in the holds', it is a marvellous 'structure above ground, storey upon storey of amplification, of development, of repetition in accordance with the foundation and lie of the land'. It is this structure of con- sciousness, not the unconscious, which is 'unique and individual- ized'. If architecture serves here partly as an analogy for the Kleinian theory of object relations, which sees the child as building up its view of the world from part to whole objects, from the mother taken simply as the breast to the mother taken as whole person, the Kleinian charting of 'storey upon storey of amplification' in our growth to adulthood can also serve as an analogy for the experience offered by great architecture. Classical architecture ('Mother of the Arts') may be thought of as re-making for us an image of the whole mother by the agency of its ' outside character' as an 'ego-defining object'. Since the reparation of the mother through a love that was 'a simple accountancy with the outside world' was preceded by the infant's fantasy attacks on her, architecture will reflect both posi- tions: 'We are grateful to stone buildings for their stubborn material, hacked and hewed but put together carefully, restored in better shape than those pieces that the infant imagined he had chewed or scattered, for which he searched'. In this new 'myth' (to adopt Stokes' own meaning for the word) 'smooth' and 'rough' function not as either/or opposites, as 'carving' and 'modelling' sometimes seemed to, but as complementaries : 'every work of art compounds the two trends'. A sense of 'accentuated otherness' can only be achieved out of creative struggle with the 'versatile interior giants' who keep alive our aggressions. Art is made out of a self-acceptance</page><page sequence="6">ADRIAN STOKES: TWO 229 and in turn offers an opportunity for self-acceptance to its beholder2: Architecturally, we experience the beloved as the provident mother. The building which provokes by its beauty a positive response, resuscitates an early hunger or greed in the disposition of morsels that are smooth with morsels that are rough, or of wall- space with apertures ... it is as if those apertures had been torn in that body by our revengeful teeth so that we experience as a beautiful form, and indeed as indispensable shelter also, the outcome of sadistic attacks, fierce yet smoothed, healed into a source of health which we would take inside us and preserve there unharmed for the source of our goodness: as if also - the apposi- tion though contradictory should cause no surprise - as if the smooth body of the wall-face, or the smooth vacancy within the apertures, were the shining breast, while the mouldings, the pro- jections, the rustications, the tiles, were the head, the feeding nipple of that breast. Such is the return of the mourned mother in all her calm and beauty and magnificance. She was mourned owing to the strength of greed, owing to the wealth of attacks that have been made on her attributes whenever there has been frustration. Greed is excited once more but achieves a guiltless catharsis on this sublimated level. And so, we welcome the appearance or re-appearance of the whole object which by con- tradistinction has helped to unify the ego; the joining, under one head, of love and of apparent neglect which thereby may become less fantastic; the entire object, self-subsistent in opposing attitudes. Perhaps only in Ruskin could we find prose of such liturgical force to carry us from a seemingly ingenious 'as if' to the inevitable 4 And so' of the last sentence: it would be very hard to analyse so heady a mixture of exposition, theorising, idiosyncracy and sheer sung elo- quence and wonder, hard even to say whether or not the faint aroma of embarrassingly earnest hobby-horsedom comes from anything more than a superficial first impression. For all its elusive density the prose is a spontaneous outflow of strong emotion too; the 'mourned mother', restored in art, seems invested in the mysterious, many- sided beneficence of some oriental goddess, the friendly divinity of a rational and humanist worship. The passage is a kind of deliberate fantasy in praise of reason and adulthood. Stokes is returning what he always calls psycho-analytic 'science' to its necessary ground of myth: it is not surprising that, to do so, he has to take a few risks. 2 This acceptance is seen as a product of the influence form has on its psychological content. It would therefore be equally misleading to describe Stokes' position either as 'moral' or 'aesthetic': the two do not make separate categories in his thought.</page><page sequence="7">230 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY I should guess, however, that many readers will find something worked-up and, so to speak, unconvincingly convincing about this fascinating passage, despite the verve and authority it com- municates. Even allowing for the fact that Stokes intends no literal anthropomorphism by phrases like 'the feeding nipple', his argu- ment may appear too self-fulfilling, as if he were using the Kleinian concept of the 'depressive position' to underwrite a knowingness about Form which is, in fact, on a par with that knowingness about the artist's unconscious for which he berates other psycho-analytical critics. The latter, moreover, might object that their kind of concern with how a specific artist creates a specific work of art can better serve an understanding of art as a whole than can general specula- tion about some imaginary, composite, classical building. The bloodstock school of art history - with artist sired out of artist in unremitting sequence - would probably respond in a similar spirit3; Such objections strike me as being finally rather sterile and literal- minded (passing up too many good things in the defence of academic chastity) but I do think that we would be being too indulgent to Stokes if we tried to forget them altogether. He did, perhaps, choose an autobiographical base for Smooth and Rough because it conveniently absolved him from the need to make his argument pragmatic or inductive whilst leaving him freer to generalise. Thus, when he does finally get round to a lyrical coda about particular architects like Palladio and Bramante, he is avowedly impressionistic and makes no attempt to analyse how a 'guiltless sublimation' might have operated in their work. Likewise, the book's illustrations are so pointedly left to speak for themselves that it is difficult to let them do so: they so clearly have to speak for the book they illustrate. The best defence of Smooth and Rough against such criticisms is that they tend to ignore the succinct concentrated literary form of the book because of a demand for the kind of scientific and scholarly spelling out of the argument which never trusts the reader to make his or her own inferences from it. When Stokes does want to test his theories against an extended account of one artist's life and works, as in Michelangelo , he does so with eager- ness. And Smooth and Rough itself is a distillation of countless particular responses to art rather than a shop-window for a priori theorising. Any response to the book which is fuelled by no more than a desire to repel the Kleinian boarding-party from the Temple of Art might easily conclude with an unwitting shelving of those 3 In fact, the two disciplines - both nineteenth-century in their inception - share, in some respects, a common sense of determinism in the intellectual structures they work with. It is a sense Stokes is often ready to resist and even undermine, in both fields.</page><page sequence="8">ADRIAN STOKES: TWO 231 necessary basic questions about the nature of art's effect on us which it is Stokes' distinction to raise with such directness. Stokes' approach to classical architecture in Chapter 6 implicitly assumes that the profoundest artistic experiences offer us the chance of a communal and not just a private, connoisseurly kind of catharsis. The next, and last, chapter - 'The Machine Age' - makes this wider cultural dimension of the aesthetic argument plain by a kind of counterpointing that is deployed throughout Smooth and Rough : it adumbrates the 'romantic' counterpoint to classical build- ings.4 The 'predominantly paranoid' culture created by the machine is swiftly diagnosed in a way that is broadly within the organicist tradition of Ruskin and Morris (though Stokes' wry studiousness shows that things have got too bad for virtuous denunciations to be in order). The machine, unlike the tools of the creative craftsman, predicates at its worst a puppet human boggling weakly at the 'Frankenstein's monster' that has been fashioned to pander to both his 'sense of omnipotent power' and his 'closely allied sense of persecution'.5 A vital part of the consequent loss of the sense of 'object-otherness' is a corresponding loss of that Greek sense of bodily awareness which, for Stokes, grounds all mature ego develop- ment. When classical temperance is set against whole-hogging transcendentalism, the 'Machine- Age' and Romanticism are no longer seen as enemies but as close, if surprising, bed-fellows; both sacrifice the 'cultural stable-point' of a firm 'body-ego' to seek to control Nature through 'omnipotent thinking': 'Thus, though a furious rebel from the Machine, Romantic Movement stands with Industrial Revolution . . . ' This splendidly sweeping insight returns us with wider understanding to those ambivalent feelings Stokes experienced at the prospect of a hostile, Victorian-built London under the threat of thé blitz. If man has created the culture of the machine 'no more from Nature than from himself', then the ultimate gist of Stokes' perplexed dismay at modern London is not only aesthetic but political too, or, rather, aesthetics, rightly taken, are eventually seen to belong within the same sphere as politics. It is form which enables us to hold our experience of our culture in 4 Though it should be added that Stokes never countenances the view that classic art is informed by emotional restraint and austere objectiveness. For instance, 'it is strange how rarely classical building - the Baroque apart - has been viewed from the side of vivid and personal emotion to which, no less than the romantic, it is subject'. {Smooth and Rough. ) 5 There is, however, none of the Luddite in Stokes. He writes about the machine in the hope that it may be better harnessed to human needs, not out of any sort of Ruskinian enmity to it. His dream of a new 'humanism', moreover, entails re-uniting science and art, just as, in his view, they were united in The Renaissance.</page><page sequence="9">232 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY common and Stokes' trust in the beneficence of form is, in its essence, also a plea for a culture that can, like the Greek, enfold us by feelings we hold in common, in which we can recognise ourselves as human beings rather than as the 'demoniac romantic puppets' of machines we ourselves have made. Smooth and Rough only considers art from a personal, autobiographical angle in order to give a sharper witness to the common human needs which art is expected to satisfy: more detailed social/political illustration of its argument would only distract the reader from its fundamental and unswerving political thrust. ii A graphic sense of the immense difficulties with which all creativity is inevitably faced also informs Michelangelo: A Study in the Nature of Art (1955). It is one of Stokes' most moving books, though its subject might well have prompted some dreary roll-call of glory. Stokes is too alive to the pain from which Michelangelo had to construct his greatness to want to belittle him with idolatry. He already had to bite his over-effusive tongue for those grudging, back-handed references in his earlier books which invidiously contrast his art with the truly 'sculptural' art of the fifteenth century and snipe at him as a 'modeller' and 'expressionist' who was the guilty instigator of the Baroque.6 Such rampant value-judgements could fool no-one; it was obvious that calm order like Piero 's could hardly be expected to issue out of the super-charged emotional content of Michelangelo's art and equally clear that such emotions could not be ostracised by criticism from the legitimate content of art. The task of revising his estimate of Michelangelo therefore obliged Stokes to extend further the scope of his own aesthetic. By 1955 one of Stokes' chief preoccupations was with trying tó understand how an authentic formal beauty could be articulated from an emotional content far less rational and more distraught than Piero 's, out of pain, conflict and loss. The terms that sufficed for Piero seemed insufficient for proper appreciation of the different 'nobility', instinct with energy and pathos, of Michelangelo's great heroic nudes. Their creator is commended instead for a psy- chological risk-taking which contrives to win images of coherence 6 No doubt such prejudices reveal Stokes' desire to break free of the emotional striving he associated with Romanticism; they may also owe something to his friendship with Pound.</page><page sequence="10">ADRIAN STOKES: TWO 233 out of an experience of disintegration - the greatness of the Medici Chapel, for instance, is that in achieving this end its allegories also manage to 'keep loss fresh'. In Michelangelo, to sublimate is not to supplant and the wholeness his art discloses is a discovery made possible by inner struggle; the wholeness of Piero 's art (in Stokes' account of it) seems to be as much instilled into it by the previously whole artist as something that painting has enabled him to find. Stokes dwells much on the following aphorism of Michelangelo's, from a letter to Fattucci: 'You will say with truth that I am old and mad: I tell you there is no better approach to sanity and balance than to be mad'. In other words, Stokes celebrates Michelangelo most for things which might previously have struck him as a source of weakness: 'Harried with inner persecution and with melancholy, he remained susceptible and aware to the end: it is the first ground of his greatness'. A reader of The Quattro Cento might well wonder whether it wasn't precisely these things which made Michelangelo's art over-wrought and it is to answer such doubts that Stokes needs to extend his notion of form. Theory has to grow in the direction that great art makes it grow. For Stokes the key to Michelangelo's sense of form lies in the com- plexity of his attitude to his material. The appeal of the marble block is double, an 'image of all-inclusive oneness as well as of individual separateness' Stokes' prejudice against mystical feeling is modified to acknowledge the struggle of Michelangelo's figures to emerge from the stone to which they nevertheless belong, their embodying of a tension between otherness and envelopment that is far more intense than anything in the relief carving of Tempio. Form is now thought of as both setting the good object away from us and inviting us to merge with it, complementing the sense of otherness with a sense of 'kinship with the universe'. At the root of the imagination lies the capacity for love (one hadn't expected to be reminded of Shelley! ) : Art, I believe, as well as love, offers us some share in the oceanic feeling. Yet, with the phantasm of homogeneity, of singleness, the lover experiences in the beloved her singularity: she is the acme of emotive otherness, the essence of object. Now this appreciation of the object's separate sufficiency united to a sense of identity with the pulse of things, prefigures, in my opinion, the sentiments that works of art in general stimulate in us, whatever their subject- matter or their occasion. Art achieves a harmony by taking into account the dis-harmony of its constitutive feelings. Oceanic emotion must be balanced if the artist is not to be plunged into the vortex of subjectivity, and Michelangelo's carving sense of the object's 'self-sufficiency' serves</page><page sequence="11">234 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY to canalise the instinctual id content of his art and to ease its 4 manic trend'. That is, form resolves what, to Stokes, are often negative feel- ings by giving them expression: there is no question of any idealizing repression. It is thus because of (not in spite of) the huge melancholy of the Medici Chapel nudes that, through mourning, they enable Michelangelo to restitute his lost 'good-objects', to translate their interior dimness into outward form. And so, when he quotes Michelangelo's paradoxical boast that 'I liv£ on my death', Stokes Fig. 1. Michelangelo, La Notte , Tomb of Giuliano de' Medici (detail), Medici Chapel, Florence. ascribes a far more precise role in artistic creation to the death instincts than he had when speaking of the feeling as of 'the finality of death' that governs the art of Piero. Such finality is now viewed less as the crown of an austere and silent impersonality and more as a fortunate resolution of the personal: 'the distinctive character of art [is] as self-expression or catharsis'. This does not mean that Stokes had applied a false theory to Piero, however; merely, that ego-psychology helps him to clarify his former belief that true self- expression in art is, because of the nature of form itself, always impersonal. Outside the self, within the artist's material, lie the only means of both self-realisation and self-transcendence.</page><page sequence="12">ADRIAN STOKES: TWO 235 It follows from this idea of a kind of non-Romantic catharsis that Stokes should lay greater emphasis on the quality of heroic release in Michelangelo's art than on his sense of heroic striving. What strikes him in the Adam or the St Sebastian is less their obvious energy than a certain 'lassitude'. The liberating sense of 'encumberment disen- throneď of the David he finds less characteristic than the harder- won Fig. 2.

The word 'enlisted' (like foot-soldiers?) seems revealing. Stokes' stress falls more firmly on the disencumberment than on what is disencumbered; 'naturalistic', in proximity to</page><page sequence="14">ADRIAN STOKES: TWO 237 'idealizing', carries in it some suggestion of the imperfectly natural made whole by Michelangelo's mastery of the nude. This impression is partly confirmed by the way Stokes develops his thought about 'adulthood' from Smooth and Rough in relation to what he sees as the oceanic component of Michelangelo's art: . . . awareness of our own identity has always been based upon the flesh; the outer world of objects was conceived in the first place almost as an extension of our bodies. This early view, of course, bears no resemblance to an adult impression. But art tends to return some of the way back to the sources of feeling and percep- tion. If we could put ourselves at the service of Michelangelo's genius, we should find that he illuminates strongly the compulsion in all art. That 'of course' feels too hurried for the confidence it pretends to whereas 'tends to return some of the way' seems judicially cautious as well as just judicious: it hardly prepares us for the word 'compul- sion'. Stokes seems anxious to attribute a certain spiritual poise to great art, almost as if (though this might be nit-picking) he were just a little afraid that the 'sources of feeling and perception, might still get out of hand and perturb the composed pain of those healing Pietàs. If great art bespeaks a great degree of integration, if the 'adult' view supersedes the child's and, by extension, bad objects are superseded by good ones through successful form, then to what extent can art still permit us the thorough contemplation of the trials in which it has been forged? Is it a sufficient answer to say that great works of art are beneficent 'whatever their subject-matter or their occasion'? One can agree with Stokes that form has a content of its own but this form-content still derives from the emotional content for which the artist has sought a form in the first place. My uncertainty, that is, centres on trying to decide how far Stokes implies that in successful art the form-content not only expresses but transcends its original content. Did the ghost of Roger Fry ever haunt his writing desk? Stokes' interpretation of Michelangelo is far from being simply a matter of psychology and aesthetics; the art is always thought of as representing, above everything else, the peak of the classical tradi- tion, a unique fusion of Florentine expressiveness and plasticity with 'Quattro Cento' outwardness. It was made possible by the fact that the common iconography of the nude, created by artists like Donatello and Poliamolo, lay ready to hand and adequate to the expression of Michelangelo's inner world. Throughout the book Stokes implies that without his inheritance of 'the angry altar of the nude' Michelangelo might have become an expressionist rather than the greatest of classic artists. His achievement, that is, depended on</page><page sequence="15">238 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY Fig. 5. Michelangelo, Rondanini Pietà, Sforza Palace, Milan.</page><page sequence="16">ADRIAN STOKES: TWO 239 an immense cultural good-luck. To Stokes, the contrasting of this good-luck with the 'weakness and confusion of styles' in modern art is inescapable. The symbolic resonance of Michelangelo's art only serves to highlight the barrenness of our own iconography and that resultant self-referential concern with the picture-surface as a thing- in-itself, an almost mystical 'quidditas', which derives from painters like Monet and Seurat. Whereas Michelangelo's compulsions could be taken up into a rich iconography (the Rondandini Pietà, with its self-transforming self-portrait, is a good example), modern art has been increasingly condemned to reliance on 'the iconography of the artist himself'. Catharsis on the scale of Michelangelo's has thus become merely a dream, just as, for Stokes, any possible re-discovery of the nude has too. The implication of this (as it may sound) unsympathetic verdict on modern art is that integration, both on the personal level and in form, is always as much a cultural as an individual achievement. If we assent to this proposition we will be unlikely to resent the fact that Stokes' praise of Michelangelo needs to be seconded by a refusal to mince words about the failings of con- temporary art: both the refusal and the praise come out of an intensely contemporary concern. The wide scope of this concern is made even clearer in the some- what forbiddingly named Greek Culture and the Ego (1 958). The book in fact seeks to define something light and measured rather than some- thing turgid: the Greek value of 'temperance', the 'nothing too much' that Stokes had found earlier in Giorgione and in the con- genial art of Raphael. It is 'temperance' which informs the Greek conception of the body - the nude - with health and sanity, acknowledging primitive 'excess' yet eschewing the 'unqualified vaunting of enveloping states of mind'. Greek art proclaims an Apollonian goal of 'ego-integration'; it is rational and redemptive, never transfixed in inner anguish. 'For, as soon as any experience is translated into art, it becomes bearable'. It was precisely this sense of the beneficence of form itself by which, in Stokes' view, the art of Michelangelo had been shaped. If the assumption that 'any experience' will be made 'bearable' through form seems a shade off- hand it is, I suspect, because Stokes is over-eager to allay any doubts over whether his commitment to 'good-objects' is the upshot of a too great concern with the 'subject-matter' ('experience') of art working to the detriment of 'formal values'; such a concern had, after all, been the Waterloo of many other psycho-analytic critics. This would help to explain why, in Stokes' version of Michelangelo, the most painful images seem to have subsumed their painful content into form rather too smoothly. For instance, in this beautiful description of the Rondandini Pietà:</page><page sequence="17">240 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY Ancient grief and depression calmly occupy the field in virtue of their paraphrase of death: but Michelangelo's Saviour will redeem and carry him: at the very last there is the first love, head by head, mouth at breast, an utterly forlorn contentment that merges gradually with the undivided nature of the final sleep. Here, Stokes seems to be only too willing to admit content - when the content is the right one. It is hard to think of the Pietà without calling more to mind all the strain that had to be traversed in order to arrive at such freedom from straining, the cruelly attenuated brokenness, the continuing pain out of which such 'forlorn content- ment' has come. Part of the beauty of the work is that it seems to cherish its own anguish, to quell any hungering to sublimate it: hence, its absolute honesty about itself. Somehow Stokes' conclud- ing stress on 'the undivided nature of the final sleep' puts that immense labour of catharsis too much into the past tense. It is ironic that such a reservation only suggests itself at all because of the unusually wide beneficence which Stokes attributes to 'Form in Art' and to Michelangelo's command of form in particular. To Stokes, form contains an intrinsic content of its own, beyond design; it gathers in a content to itself and this content is metamorphosed in form from the original, non-formal content it began by being, just as in gestalt psychology something from the perceiver is thought to gather around the image perceived. This content is seen as essentially corporeal - hence Stokes' emphasis on the nude. The ego has the capacity to impute what Stokes calls an 'ego-figure' to form, to externalise its inner world onto the world of objects. This is not merely self-projection since the self is only com- pleted by its objects which, when made whole through formal expres- sion, can be 'perpetually re-introjected'. By its nature form has an integrative role: '. . . an imago of ego-integration is projected and perceived as an object, i.e. this imago comes to us from the external world in the terms of a whole and independent and corporeal- seeming structure'. The phrase is ponderous, the idea crucial; it decisively distinguishes Stokes' aesthetic from that of Roger Fry. The theory can grant a measure of 'impersonality' to form and include the aesthete's 'abstracted interest in structure' whilst at the same time doing far more than Fry did to explain the more general human value that has always been attributed to art. The theory elaborated in Greek Culture and the Ego , in fact, tries to express what had always been one of Stokes' prime beliefs: in the paramount importance to us of our visual sense, of simple non-aesthetic seeing, in the struggle for inner stability. Stokes' concern with the ability of Greek art to project a 'body- image' may seem not to square very well with the fact that, in his</page><page sequence="18">ADRIAN STOKES: TWO 241 work as a whole, there is a notable failure to write at any length on several great painters - Tintoretto, El Greco, Rubens for example - whose 'corporeal' sense is on the whole non-Greek. One conjectures that he tended to regard as unduly manic any enlisting of the body in the expression of passionate or mystical states; similarly, a wish to retain a sense of the perfected balance given to the human form in Greek sculpture may have somewhat blinded him to that more actual celebration of the unpurifiable flesh that is found in Rubens. He always shows greater interest in art which he judges to be the fruit of a successful 'sublimation' than in art where 'sublimation' has either not been sought or has been abortive.7 One indirect confirma- tion of this tendency in Greek Culture and the Ego itself is to be found in the surprisingly small amount of space it gives to Greek Tragedy, despite its concern with 'catharsis'. What little Stokes does say only gives the impression of his having censured Oedipus Tyrannus from his account of Greek culture in order to devote more time to finding equivalents for the accomplished serenity of Oedipus at Colonus. The value of Greek tragedy for Stokes lies mainly in a distanced recogni- tion of Dionysos, 'without the super-abundant aid of mystical identification'. He thinks of tragedy as a 'canalisation of the hyper- manic' - or, it might be objected, an ail-too hubristic effort to keep 'hysterica passio' at bay. Given such blind spots it is inevitable that Stokes' notion of formal beauty should at times seem to entail a sort of edifying constriction as well as a release, as if classic art celebrated only a body divested of its flesh. Yet it would clearly be wrong to suggest that he wants to attribute to humanist art a selective attitude to its subject-matter. His position is rather that form has the property of being able to transmute and surpass any subject-matter, even the grimmest. This idea is worked out in detail in the long- pondered essay called 'Form in Art'. It sees the artist's 'creation of Form' as 'a benign or unifying experience, however dire his subject matter': Pre-Columbian Mexican stone masks often express a powerful sadism or bloodthirstiness : it comes through to us as we look at the masks. It comes through to us, as it was meant to, in terms of the calm, suave yet austere curves that it feeds. No other form of communication is likely to be more expressive of this blood- curdling content, yet the mask does not horrify the aesthete. He is aware, of course, of the blood-thirsty intensity and he perhaps values all the more - but it is obvious that taste will oscillate here a 7 In general, Stokes seems to me to show a marked lack of interest in comedy, irony and the grotesque in art. This perhaps contributes to the sense of a certain thinness of actual experience in the good objects he describes and to a certain inaccessibility to images of extreme emotion, either of pain or joy, in his criticism.</page><page sequence="19">242 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY good deal - the powerful serenity, the spare enclosure, the beauty of the form. Mexican artists discovered an enduring pattern for strong emotions without belittling them, without (manic) protestation. There comes to us the perception of a fructifying object, inanimate though it be.8 The insight is a valuable one and very subtle in the way it keeps 'content' in its aesthetic place without relegating it to no place at all. Nonetheless, Stokes does seem to view the content (of 'blood- thirstiness') in a slightly negative light. His accent falls more on the process of transformation than on what was originally there to be transformed and this has the effect of making the final 'serenity' seem too smoothly achieved. To appear to half-forget the content is rather beside the initial expressive point. In that event, Stokes' ensuing claim, that such art can 'preside over a world more unexpurgated than is usual', loses some of its force. The 'blood- thirstiness' must surely continue to strike us with all its weight as 'bloodthirstiness', though art has offered a means of viewing it for what it is without disorientating us, if the sculptures are to seem both 'unexpurgated' and benignant. If, as Stokes says again and again, 'Form has a content of its own', it does not necessarily follow that that content is the only content art has or the only one which actively moves us.9 Stokes does not subscribe consciously to that kind of idealism but he does sometimes seem to speak rather loftily from the side of the artistic sublimations he describes, as if looking backwards and slightly downwards to the things which the artist has sublimated. One detects a faint whiff of spiritual patronage when he says that the 'integrated ego' in art also 'embraces some inclinations of the primitive ego': it sounds a very firm and paternal sort of embrace, almost as if the pleasure afforded by art partly consists in letting us off emotionally heart-whole. That, at any rate, is the sort of misrepresentation of Stokes' views that one may be provoked into by a book which seems so near to equating Athenian humanism with the nature of art in general - the strong parti pris can temporarily blinker one to the worth of what it celebrates. It is necessary to be half-convinced from the start to really enjoy Greek Culture and the Ego. 8 A Game That Must Be Lost: Collected Papers, introd. Eric Rhode (Carcanet Press, 1973), p. 1 12. ('Form in Art' was first drafted in 1931 and revised several times later.) 9 In Greek Culture and the Ego Stokes' recognition of the non-formal content of art is most apparent not in what he says about particular works of art themselves, which is oddly little, but in his concern with the culture out of which Greek art sprang (including its science). This was partly by way of a counter to what he saw as Freud's over-negative view of the relations between art and culture, viz. 'art offers substitute gratifications for the oldest cultural renunciations . . . and for that reason serves as nothing else to reconcile men to the sacrifices made on behalf of culture. ' ( The Future of an Illusion)</page><page sequence="20">ADRIAN STOKES : TWO 243 III Though Stokes' last books continue to affirm our need for reparation their tone is often grave with a lack of hope. Pessimism about present-day culture was both a cause and a consequence of his search for 'good objects' in art. This is not to attribute the cast of his later thought to embitteredness: his voice remains as life-fostering as ever, in spite of the fact that he saw little prospect of modern culture's ever serving the end of 'ego-integration'. In Three Essays on the Painting of Our Time (1961) modern art is thought of as conducting its experiments in an uneasy cultural limbo whilst architecture, the true 'mother of the arts', has become almost defunct under the successive blows of Gothic Revivalism and modern plasticity. Since about the time of Delacroix, art has 'seemed to be creating culture rather than culture art' and, as a result of the drying-up of the old myths, a sentiment of cultural exile has deepened and congealed into a sense of homelessness. As the iconographical content which had previously served to bind art to culture has decayed or become diluted, so art has more and more appeared as a thing-in-itself. From the mid-nineteenth century there has been a progressive 'isolating of the aesthetic content'. In other words, Stokes is saying that art's capacity for conferring beneficence, which is what he most values art for, has been severely diminished. Yet this very disquiet- ing thought does not lead the late books into mere harping on a black future. In showing what has been lost Stokes is always trying to show what must be regained. He still has his own serenity to impart, and in its most distilled form. The most interesting development in the last books is less their diagnosis of modern culture as schizoid than their new understand- ing of the way feelings Stokes had previously regarded as negative also have a part to play in the creation of the aesthetic 'good object'. For example, the 'compulsive element' in Turner is seen as capable of translation into a source of aesthetic value: 'a successful sublima- tion of obsessional attitudes . . . signifies that some degree of aesthetic (i.e. integrative) employment has been won from tendencies often hosjtile to any integrative role'. {Painting and the Inner World) The expression of such 'tendencies' is felt to be especially widespread in modern art. Following Freud (in Civilisation and its Discontents ), Stokes had dubbed these feelings 'oceanic' when he found them in Michelangelo; the words he now favours are 'envelop- ment', 'incantation' and 'invitation', by all of which he means to refer to that dynamic element in the work of art which carries us out of ourselves and invites us to merge into it. Stokes felt that this experience, which is akin to the mystic's sense of oneness with the</page><page sequence="21">244 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY world, had come to the fore in art since Impressionism. Both Monet and Seurat had been virtuoso exponents of painting which had an 'overall' or 'enveloping' appeal. The change they epitomise goes hand in glove with a 'decay in iconography' and the growing pre- occupation with the 'picture surface' in itself which results from that decay. Stokes calls this new 'non-symbolic' but 'mystical' attitude to the canvas by the name of 'is-ness' (the word is borrowed from Aldous Huxley). He has in mind the way the 'unstoppable super- reality' of abstract artists like Kandinsky and Mondrian contrives to bypass the object altogether (and hence the symbol too) and offer an experience of boundless 'envelopment'. Such a 'boundless, bountiful good' is not, however, adequate to the expression of culture: 'is-ness' and abstraction are self-referential whereas culture is 'one of our most comprehensive symbolic objects'. Thus, artistic form and cultural content, no longer connected through a living iconography, have split, leaving us rapt but bereft, without 'deeply founded symbolism' to 'stabilise culture'. Even an artist as great as Picasso is felt to lack any 'cultural and subsuming style' and has to develop by a brilliant but hand-to-mouth hopping from one individual style to the next, with an apparent absence of self- continuity that would have been inconceivable in a Renaissance giant like Michelangelo. Nevertheless, Stokes still believed that the twentieth century was a 'great age of graphic art' and, indeed, he was increasingly responsive to the incantatory note in its art in his later years. He regards the 'is-ness' at which he demurs as being, in some sense, a true reflection of the 'culture' of the period, precisely because of its non-symbolic character.10 His quarrel, that is, is not so much with modern art itself as with the culture which it has been given to express. It would be misleading not to add that Stokes' keenest interest in modern art goes to its attempts to rectify what he sees as its most unbalancing tendencies. (Such attempts, of course, also help him to identify the general malaise. ) For instance, the extremely suggestive discussion of the Cubists' discovery of collage, in Reflections on the Nude (1967). Collage is seen as an attempt to bring back into art the 'carving' values that affirm its quality of 'object-otherness'. It tries to take on the functions relinquished by an over-plastic and non-tactile modern architecture (Stokes admired Le Corbusier, but not as an architect). In a way, the invention of collage was like a burst of fire from a dug-out, a small dramatic flare-up in a culture where the 'mother of the arts', our basic means of expressing the inner world in terms of the outer, spawned towns whose only hallmark was their 10 See, for example, A Game That Must Be Lost , pp. 156-7: 'Symbolism can never be undone' etc.</page><page sequence="22">ADRIAN STOKES: TWO 245 'harsh hallucinatory quality'. There is a passage in The Invitation in Art (1965) where Stokes, wryly contemplating the hideous gas- ometer at the Oval, speaks passionately of our need to 'rescue man- made objects from bizarredom'. Yet he concedes that the frenzied stylistic experimentation of modern art may, paradoxically, have represented a genuinely outward-facing effort to turn this 'bizarredom' to symbolic uses: I believe that the swift evolution of modern art, and its desire for the shock of the ever new, reveal an attempt to reach a com- promise with our disjointed urban environment, with the illimit- able enveloping quality of the startling chaos around us. Stokes seems to think of the predicament of the modern artist as a kind of Hobson's choice: to try to mirror culture is to risk succumb- ing to its limiting engulfing quality whilst to seek to bring art back into the mainstream of 'carving' values may be to risk turning art away from its culture into some marginal sub-culture of its own making. Coming from a writer who had always seen art as the chief means of cementing the cultural bond, this diagnosis seems a very grim one. It is not, however, made in a spirit of indictment and Stokes is always generously appreciative of the particular master- pieces of modern art. He is the most urbane and affirmative of Jeremiahs, the least doleful. In fact, it is precisely this quality which, in my opinion, makes what he has to say about modern culture especially sobering and gives his voice that composed authority - stringent, unflinching, but never exultant - which is best suited to the clear communication of disquieting home truths. For it is a rare and refreshing thing to find prophecy that has freed itself from the distractions of aggression and denunciation. The main impression left by the late books is not, in fact, of an old man's gloom but of his still-growing zest for life and for what makes art life-giving. As he says, in a moving passage in A Game That Must Be Lost , 'This world is never so beautiful as when we are on the point of leaving it'. One sign of this growing openness to experience in his last years was the way he could branch out beyond the artistic tastes expressed in his earlier books. The fullest discussion of one individual artist in the late books is devoted to Turner, someone he had hardly mentioned before. The essay is very much a matter of self-education, of the critic striving to see beyond his previous bias against 'envelopment' in art. It defines Turner's greatness as a capacity to turn dross into gold, to win health out of disintegration: though he peopled the 'declivities of vast canvases with variegated dolls' - 'part-objects' - Turner could still restitute the overridden object in a uniquely restorative form. Stokes' evocation of late T urner has never been bettered :</page><page sequence="23">246 THE CAMBRIDGF QUARTERLY ... in many, very many, supremely lyrical works, a linking, a co- ordination, an integration, of different degrees of compulsion and different tendencies of the mind were achieved. In the great last period, not only is the world washed clean by light, but humidity is sucked from water, the core of fire from flame, leaving an iridescence through which we witness an object's ceremonious identity: whereupon space and light envelop them and us, cement the world under the aegis of a boat at dawn between Cumaean head-lands, or a yacht that gains the coast. Together with Turner's whirlpool of fire and water we experience beneficence in space. There abound calm scenes that would be sombre or forlorn without the gold, without the agitated pulse and delicacy in so light a key. Beneficence is widely scattered; encompasses from afar. {Painting and the Inner Worlds 1963) In this essay, at least, Stokes could not be accused of playing down the role of the anarchic erotic (id) instincts in the process of 'ego- integration'. The poetic feeling for Turner's lyricism in this passage is the logical issue of a careful study of the grimmer, more twisted Turner whom the lyricism often makes us forget. Stokes values the 'beneficence' of the paintings all the more because it was not easily won (he had valued Michelangelo's sculptures for the same reason). It is, I think, true to say of the last books in general that they celebrate the labour of sublimation almost as much as the achieved sublimation itself. It was this belief in the human capacity for psychic growth which led Stokes, in his last book, to call Rembrandt 'the greatest of artists' even though he sees Rembrandt's painting as radically different from the classical art he had always commended most: Rembrandt, it seems to me, painted the female nude as the sagging repository of jewels and dirt, of fabulous babies and magical faeces despoiled yet later repaired and restored, a body often flaccid and creased yet still the desirable source of a scarred bounty: not the bounty of the perfected, stable breast housed in the temple of the integrated psyche that we possess in the rounded forms of classical art, but riches and drabness joined by the infant's interfering envy, sometimes with the character of an oppressive weight or listlessness left by his thefts. There supervenes, none the less, a noble acceptance of ambivalence in which love shines. {Reflections on the Nude) It is as if the contemplation of Rembrandt's 'scarred bounty' prompts Stokes to admit, if only fleetingly, that there may be limits</page><page sequence="24">ADRIAN STOKES: TWO 247 to the humanness which can be revealed through the order and sanity of 'classical art'. 4 Art of whatever kind bears witness to intact objects even when the subject-matter is disintegration' - Rem- brandt's restored objects may move us even more than those of the Athenians, from having been more deeply rooted in loss. They are supremely satisfying precisely because the very source of the need for form lies in the fact that 'the chaotic is at best only just behind all of us'. In dwelling on Rembrandt's 'noble acceptance of ambivalence in which love shines' what Stokes is doing is to stress the way that the 'Image in Form' can embody, and return us to, the life from which it has been constructed. Similarly, the psycho-analytic language, perhaps off-putting at first, is an earnest of Stokes' refusal to see art as fenced off inside any separate enclosure - either aesthetic or art-historical - of its own. He asks us always to think of great art as affirming the bond of culture and humanness, as a means as well as an end, and a large part of his importance, especially as a writer on modern art, lies in the fact that in speaking of the possibilities of art he speaks about the possibilities of our living. He does this, moreover, whilst always seeing art as art and never as 'literary' or moralising. As he says so disarmingly at the very end of Reflections on the Nude : .'Pictures are not problems'. In his own work, they are never in danger of becoming so. IV Stokes' analysis of transcendental emotion in modern painting led him, in a way, to think beyond art and this trend is even more marked in his specifically psycho-analytic papers, collected posthumously by Eric Rhode in 1973 as A Game That Must Be Lost.u A Game is one of Stokes' profoundest books and any attempt at a potted account of its riches would be like trying to number the trees in a thick wood: it deserves long fréquentation, not flying visits. Yet some cursory indication of its interest is necessary since, in so many ways, the book sums up and distils almost everything Stokes had been trying to say for over forty years. Perhaps the most ubiquitous preoccupation of A Game is with the nature of the death instincts, a theme inherited from the later Freud of Beyond the Pleasure Principle. Many of the papers dwell on what might be called the wisdom of old age, though they are by no means concerned just with the experience of growing old. They meditate on 'resignation' and 'renunciation' in a mood like that of some more 11 Unless otherwise specified, all further quotations are taken from this book.</page><page sequence="25">248 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY buoyant Sophoclean chorus. For example, in the title paper Stokes posits the existence of an 'inner opponent' to the libido, an instinct of 'refusal'. He sees loss and anxiety as the libido's way of fending off this instinct which, itself more serene, preserves an impersonal stance that keeps us from smothering our good objects in our anxiety for them: 'the very richness and variety of the objects about which we are anxious may tend to be reduced, even eliminated, by the anxiety itself'. Anxiety may 'strangle spontaneity' whereas, in appeasing it, the 'refusal' instinct helps to return our good objects to themselves. It is not necessary to be old to learn this lesson of the finite scope of the ego or to grasp the 'close fusion' of Thanatos with Eros: 'in all life-giving and life-preserving responses there is mingled an impulse, however faint, of refusal, in virtue of which no creature needs to be taught about death. The sense of loss and anxiety that arises out of threats, is thereby seen as the libidinal response to an innate refusal.' Yet from this streak of stoic detachment comes the bonus of a freer kind of attachment: 'if we die at the moment of perfect realisation, it will be we who leave a scene which is not itself thereby disturbed'. By allaying Eros the 'refusal' instinct helps to free Eros from its fretfully possessive relation to its objects. What Stokes is trying to picture is, in other words, the reverse of some Apollonian suppression of the id. Being resigned to death is really the best pre- paration for benefiting from life. One of the things these late papers seem to be saying, then, is that, in the words of Shakespeare's Timon, 'Nothing brings me all things'. Stokes' respect for the death instincts is, in some measure, a recogni- tion of the value of what Yeats a little glibly called 'tragic joy'. This suggestion may receive some corroboration from a brief reference to one of Lionel Trilling's essays on Freud, in which he too discusses the role of the death instincts.12 Trilling wrestles with a paradox he finds in Wordsworth and Keats, and finds Nietzsche capitalising upon, the fact that in art we are able to see 'very painful facts with a kind of pleasure'. He argues that Freud's theory of the death instinct is a sign of his 'oneness' with the literary tradition of tragedy: 'For literature has always recorded an impulse of the self to find affirma- tion even in its own extinction, even by its own extinction'. Freud surely helps Stokes to shape a similar paradox into a source of spiritual value, though Stokes does not need to invoke the spirit of American liberal individualism as Trilling does when he writes: . . . when we take into account the age-old impulse of highly developed spirits to incorporate the idea of death into the 12 'Freud: Within and Beyond Cultur Beyond Culture: Essays on ' Literature and Learning ' (Seeker and Warburg, 1966).</page><page sequence="26">ADRIAN STOKES: TWO 249 experience of life, even to make death the criterion of life, we are drawn to the belief that the assertion of the death instinct is the effort of finely tempered minds to affirm the self in an ultimate confrontation of reality. If Stokes eschews that last confrontation in the last metaphysical corral it is because his faith is invested more in art and in the outward world art directs him towards than in any notion of there being an ultimate self for us to test. Art, for him, expresses the self by making manifest our ability to transcend the self, to augment it through symbols. In his paper 'Art and Metapsychology', which addresses the same paradox that Trilling is discussing, he argues that art's 'articulation' of its content can become more important to us than the content itself, however painful that content may be; the kind of 'tragic' self of which Trilling speaks may already be translated into some further serenity by the very act of artistic crea- tion itself.13 Perhaps, in the last analysis, it seems as if Stokes' belief in the beneficence of art makes the experience of tragedy impossible to him. Tragic suffering is something which, by admitting into itself, form takes us beyond. Art, like resignation, reconciles us to reality by other means than staging a 'confrontation' with it. To Stokes, there is nothing enforced or saddened about resigna- tion; it is rather a form of 'temperance' which helps us to accept life. As death approaches, 'a partial neglect of calculated and anxious gain may tend to free more libido for an enjoyment of the moment'. When that moment is prized for itself, unperturbed by the noisy claims of the self, 'the old may rediscover the useless brilliancy of a contemplative moment and, in recognising death, lighten the anxious shadow'. There is something cheerfully unguarded about Stokes' high valuation òf such contemplativeness, a gift for 'acceptance' that shares the Quixotism of civilisation itself when, as he says, it enjoins on us 'the acceptance of substitutes in the place of original objects'. If we look back to Stokes' discussions of Giorgione, long ago, where a contemplative command of 'substitution' was regarded as a fundamental characteristic of art, we will not be sur- prised that he should assert that 'the resigned are somewhat like artists'. His aesthetic had always managed to intertwine, as it were, the libidinal with the taming of Dionysos. The deepest thoughts are often like this, thoughts from youth that have not been pre- sumptuously discarded by age. Stokes can compare resignation with the process of art because by resignation he in no sense means an indifferent quiescence, but 13 'Concerning Art and Metapsychology', International Journal of Psychoanalysis vol. XXVI (1945), 177-9. (A brief paper but a very important one.)</page><page sequence="27">250 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY rather an emotional capacity for 'occasional impersonality', as in our more oceanic experiences of nature, which are the refreshing expression of 'a force in ourselves that refuses complete selfhooď. This force both is, and is not, libidinal: We are our preoccupations, including any preoccupation with not being preoccupied. I cannot myself attribute to this last a wholly Ubidinal and defensive root. The night sky can momentarily reverse in us the ill proportion of affects we encounter: so may silence, all lulling, natural sound. But I believe they promise besides, thus gently, a native part of ourselves that rids us of ourselves, a part that signifies 'to disappear', though the way of it be a swallowing up by immensity or a return to the womb. The deep libidinal way of it. The night sky liberates us 'not so much from feelings of void . . . as by those feelings as well'. In this essay, 'On Being Taken Out of Oneself', Stokes seems to come nearer than ever before to the mystic's notion of losing the self in order to find it, though perhaps that parallel ought not to be stressed. If the experience he describes is clearly in some way 'religious', his tone retains its secular ease and curiosity of spirit, too light and shrewd for pomposity or unction. It is probably better to say that Stokes' last work leaves him face to face with religious emotion, rather than with the experience of it. In 'Psycho-Analysis and our Culture', however, he is at least willing to go outside his usual 'psycho-analytic standpoint' and contemplate with a new sympathy what he sees as the religious need for envelop- ment by 'ideal ' objects : The universal religions are based on conceptions of original negativism and the hope of salvation. Stripped of strained rationalisation, their psychology is somewhat nearer [than that of 'Rationalism'] to the psycho-analytic standpoint. Hence there is a duty, I feel, to defend the poetic elements in the psychology of reli- gion; or, rather, it would be so were we unable to extract from psycho-analytic sources themselves any power that could restore to culture, and more particularly to art, a constructive sense of the transcendental. Religious ritual brings home to Stokes his own culture's dearth of art on the 'communal scale' of the great cathedrals. He has little faith in any future 'creative communion' without the emergence of some as yet undreamed of 'dogma' and less faith than might appear in psycho-analysis itself. Even his faith in the future of art is clouded and (though he remains a steadfast sceptic) seems most brightened by the hope that art may one day have a slim chance of taking over the functions of religion:</page><page sequence="28">ADRIAN STOKES: TWO 251 I distrust religion yet I am aware of respects in which I am fortunate that there are religious people; and churches, cemeteries, processions or church bells that preside, that evoke staves for time. How rarely church bells poison the good sense of the air. There is nothing to worship, much to accept, to contemplate in the common lot, as innocent of final purpose as a work of art. The only worthy symbols for all that is held in common, as well as for every variation of the inner life, are the projections wrought by art. But can ritual utterance be won for our common ground by means of the contemplation, a communal contemplation, of art? I don't often think so. If this is pessimistic only an underlying humanist hope has made it so. Out of the composed expression of a deep cultural doubt Stokes still evokes a sense of the benign re-assuringness of art and, it may be, a flickering glimpse of religious feeling. This is not a melancholy note on which to end. Stokes' final resig- nation reminds us not just of death and loss but, even more poignantly, of life and of the things within us that make for life. He found that thought of death gently yet firmly vivifying, rather in the way Wordsworth did when he wrote that 'a grave is a tranquillising object: resignation in course of time springs up from it as naturally as the wild flowers, besprinkling the turf with which it may be covered' ( Upon Epitaphs /). Stokes' late prose has abundant sinew and poetry but perhaps its most distinctive quality is, in the end, a kind of vital tranquillity which everywhere tunes the special music his ideas make. It is just one of his claims to be considered part of our literature. His life-long meditation on art and on psycho- analysis was, after all, essentially a quite un-specialist meditation upon the experience of being human. I believe that even readers who do not share his particular preoccupations will find that he still has much to say about those we all share. David Gervais</page></plain_text>
