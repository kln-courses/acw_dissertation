<plain_text><page sequence="1">Competing Chinese Names for God: The Chinese Term Question and Its Influence upon Korea Sung-Deuk Oak Abstract This paper discusses the theological discourses of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism on the Chinese terms for God and their influence upon the term question in Korea. The term question in China is important to Korea, not only because the former became the linguistic and theological background of the latter in Sino-centric East Asian culture, and because all Chinese terms were imported to Korea and had competed with Korean Protestant terms, but also because theologies and discourses developed in China were used in the controversy in Korea. The paper discusses four groups: Roman Catholics in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (the Shangdi-Tianzhu Camp and the Tianzhu Camp), British and American Protes tants (the Shangdi Camp and the Shen Camp), British Anglicans (the Tianzhu Camp), and Scottish Presbyterians (the Shangdi-Hananim Camp) in the nineteenth century.

The history of the interminable term controversy in China is important to Korea, not only because the former became the linguistic and theological background of the latter in Sino-centric East Asian culture, and because all Chinese terms were imported to Korea and had competed with Korean Protestant terms for several decades at the turn of the twentieth century, but also because theologies and discourses devel oped during the controversies in China were studied and used by the Protestant missionaries and Korean leaders in Korea before reaching a consensus around 1905. This paper discusses four groups and their theological understanding of Chinese names and terms for God. The first group is Roman Catholics (Matteo Ricci and the Jesuits, Franciscans, and Dominicans) in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The other three are British and American Protestants (the Shangdi Camp and the Shen Camp), British Anglicans (the Tianzhu Camp), and Scottish Presbyterians (the Shangdi-Hananim Camp) in the nineteenth century. It analyzes their theological discourses on the Chinese terms and their influence upon the term question in Korea. As this paper focuses on the Chinese term question, it does not go deeply into the Korean term question. Roman Catholics: From Jesuit Shangdi to Mendicant Tianzhu In China, the first camp of missionaries invented new names for God in order to counteract polytheism. The most widely used method was to combine an adjective prefix with the main word zhu (主 Lord). The use of the word "Lord" came from the traditions of the Jewish Adonai reading of the Tetra grammaton and its Greek translation Kupioç (Lord, master of supreme author ity) in the Septuagint Old Testament and the New Testament. As a result, Nestorians created a new Chinese name, Zhenzhu (眞主 True Lord), in the seventh century; Roman Catholics used Tianzhu (天主 Heavenly Lord) from the seventeenth century on; and Anglicans used both Tianzhu and Shangzhu (上主 Supreme Lord) in the nineteenth and early twentieth century.</page><page sequence="3">Oak • Competing Chinese Names for God 91 The Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci (1552-1610), who arrived in China in 1583 and in 1601 was granted permission to reside in Beijing, accommodated Christianity to classical Confucianism. Initially he employed two existing Chinese names for the Christian God, Shangdi (上帝，Sovereign on High) and Tian (天，Heaven), maintaining that under these names the Chinese had wor shipped the true Heavenly God. Ricci understood original Confucianism as an imperfect ethical theism or a viable natural philosophy that was open to God and compatible with Christianity. He strongly criticized the atheistic elements of Neo-Confucian cosmology and claimed that theism was present in ancient Confucianism. At the same time, he severely criticized polytheistic Daoism and atheistic Buddhism. Ricci adopted Shangdi from the Confucian classics and argued that they connoted Him as a personal deity who watched over both human affairs and the universe. Ricci's second term was Tian, the tran scendental Heaven, which was similar to the Western notion of Providence. Since the term Tian was introduced to Chinese religious culture later than Shangdi, around the beginning of the Zhou dynasty (ca. 1120 BCE), Tian and Shangdi were usea interchangeably in the canonical Confucian classics. How ever, under the influence of Daoism and Buddhism, by the sixteenth century Tian had long taken on the connotation of an impersonal and natural force (Lancashire and Hu 1985, 33-34). Hence, Ricci used the coined term Tianzhu as well as Shangdi in his Tianzhushiyi (天主實義1603).1 Ricci identified the Christian Tianzhu with the Chinese Shangdi of the Confucian classics and Shen (神)with the Spirit (Ricci 1953, 99-100, 125).2 However, Ricci emphasized that the impersonal taiji (太極 supreme ultimate) or li (理 ultimate principle) of Neo-Confucian cosmology could not be the origin of all things and that Tianzhu had nothing to do with the Buddhist sunyata (空 emptiness) or the Daoist wu (無 nothingness) (ibid. 98—99, 106 107).3 By understanding the character tian (heaven) as a compound letter of yi (一 one) and da (大 great)，Ricci added a new monotheistic meaning of "Great One" (unicum magnum) to the Heavenly Lord Tianzhu (ibid. 125).4 The Jesuit adoption of the original Confucian terms represented tneir accom modation to the syncretic spirit of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) and created a Confucian-Christian synthesis (Mungello 1999, 22).</page><page sequence="4">92 Journal of Korean Religions 3/2 • 2012 When the Manchus established the Qing dynasty in 1644, they became less open to foreign influences, though they hired some Jesuits at the court for their scientific knowledge. Manchu ethnocentrism, chauvinism, and xenophobia, combined wkh Confucian Orthodoxy, made the Jesuit method of blending Christianity with Confucianism less tenable among the Chinese literati. In this milieu, the mendicant orders—Dominicans and Franciscans一adopted a con frontational method and gained their constituency among the lower social classes, who were anti-literati and anti-Confucian, in rural areas like Shandong where secret societies like the White Lotus Society were burgeoning. Franciscans prohibited ancestor worship, which they saw as pagan idol worship, promoted the development of confraternities, and organized secret meetings of their followers who were persecuted by the local government (ioid. 24-26). The difference in target audience and constituency led the missionary societies to take different theological approaches to Chinese culture and religions. During the Rites Controversy over the terms for God and the ancestral rite from the middle of the seventeenth century to the early eighteenth century, Dominicans and Franciscans criticized the Jesuit method of syncretic assimila tion to Confucian terms and rituals. When Pope Clement XI banned ancestor worship in 1715, his papal bull Ex Ilia Dei prohibited the use of Shangdi and Tian, religiously and socio-politically charged words, replacing them with Tianzhu.5 The bull prohibited Shangdi because Vatican theologians thought that the Christian God Deus should not be confused with the Chinese Emperor di. In response, Emperor Yongzheng proscribed Roman Catholicism as a heterodox cult in his imperial edict of 1724. Pope Benedict VII's bull Ex Quo Singulari (1742) more completely denounced the Jesuit accommodation to pagan culture. In reaction, the Chinese court banned Christianity. Thus, the first chapter of European Christianity's encounter with Chinese religions came to a close. European cultural pride over East Asian civilization, particularly over the barbarian Manchus, closed the controversy and defeated the Riccian method. The issue of ancestor worship was closely related to that of the term question and Protestants reopened botn issues in the nineteenth century. As the Rites Controversy ended with the victory of the Tianzhu (天主）of the mendicants, the Roman Catholics in Korea used its Korean equivalent i'yonjyu (^ffj universally in vernacular literature, though they occasionally</page><page sequence="5">Oak • Competing Chinese Names for God 93 used Shyangdye (せじ,1)and Shyangjyu (せ夺)• Conservative French missionaries emphasized heroic martyrdom and spirituality under the governmental perse cutions, and did not pay attention to the traditional Korean names for God. They did not use Hanânim (許1d)，for they regarded it as a sky god of supersti tious spirit worship. The Dictionnaire Français-Coréen compiled in 1869 used only T'yônjyu and for the entry "Ciel," the author added that "les payens par respect superstitieuxdissent 斜ゼ” (the pagans say 許1d with superstitious respect) (Férron 2004 (1869)，54). The Dictionnaire Coréen-Français 韓佛字典 (1880) does not mention 許1^ under the entry of “許’’ (Ridel 1880, 77). Tianzhu (天主，T'yônjyu 培夺 or Ch'ônju 趔平）remained the official term for God for Roman Catholicism (天主敎）in Korea throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Nevertheless, after the Vatican II Council, the Korean Roman Catholic Church moved toward indigenization in the term question. When in 1971 and 1977 they made the Union Version of the Korean Bible in coopera tion with Protestants, Anglicans, and Orthodox Christians, they adopted Tianzhu's Korean equivalent, Hanùnim (許:!=■¥). The Roman Catholic Church continued to use Hanunim in their own new version of the Bible, Sônggyong 勺項,published in 2005. Protestants: Dominance and Shangdi over Shen Many Protestant missionaries belonged to the second camp that preferred using the existing names of the divine as a medium to convey a new idea of God. Protestantism, as a religion of the Bible, produced vernacular translations of the Scriptures. Different groups in China had varying ideas, linguistic and theological, on the terms for God. One dominant argument was that Theos (God) should not be translated into Zhu (Lord) because the Lord (kurios) of the Greek NT was equivalent to the tetragrammaton (YHWH).6 According to this argument, Zhenzhu, Tianzhu, and Shangzhu were Chinese equivalents to the Lord, not God. They searched for an alternative and their solution was to adopt the best vernacular name for Godjust as the Greeks had done with Theos and the English with God. Another reason for the Protestant missionaries' movement toward assimilation was their need to differentiate Protestantism from Roman Catholicism, a stigmatized foreign religion in China. One of the</page><page sequence="6">94 Journal of Korean Religions 3/2 ■ 2012 new developments made by (American) Protestant missionaries was their use of Shen as the term for God, which the Roman Catholics had used universally to designate the Spirit. 1)Shangdi Camp and Shen Camp Since Robert Morrison (1782—1834) adopted Shen in his Chinese NT in 1813, Protestant missionaries had used more than twenty Chinese names for God, some borrowed from the Confucian classics and others coined by combining Shen, Tian, Shangdi, or Zhu with other letters.7 But it was not just British and American missionaries who disagreed; Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Anglicans were also unable to find common ground. Protestant missionaries were divided into two major groups—the Shangdi camp (Shangdists) and the Shen camp (Shenites)一at the time the Board of Translators of the Delegates' Version of the New Testament was organized in 1843, and then a third group一 the Tianzhu camp—appeared in the 1870s and 1880s.8 In 1847 and 1848 missionaries produced many dissertations and tracts on the terms. The Board could not reach a consensus and consequently published the union version in two different editions in 1850. The liberal camp interpreted Shangdi (Supreme Ruler) of the Confucian classics as a historical and spiritual equivalent to the God Most High of the Bible, and the Chinese Shen as equiva lent to the Greek daimon and the Latin numen. The conservative camp insisted that Shen was a much more generic term, meaning gods, God, spirit, or soul, and that they could destroy Chinese gods by using the Christian Shen. The issue remained controversial for decades. Most British and European missionaries, William H. Medhurst, William C. Milne, Karl Giitzlaff, John Stronach, George Staunton, James Legge, and others, including Elihu Doty (1809-1864), a graduate of New Brunswick Theological Seminary in New Jersey, supported Shangdi, while most American missionaries, represented by William J. Boone and Elijah C. Bridgman, supported Shen. Accordingly, the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) and the Na tional Bible Society of Scotland (NBSS) printed the Shangdi editions, and the American Bible Society (ABS) the Shen editions. Although the BFBS had a</page><page sequence="7">Oak • Competing Chinese Names for God 95 policy of literal translation, they tolerated the literary and dynamic translation of the Old Testament by the missionaries of the London Missionary Society in 1854. This Delegates' Version (the so-called Wenli Version) of the BFBS and NBSS became much more popular by 1910 than the Bridgman-Culbertson Version of the ABS that was faithful to the literal translation. Because American missionaries occupied most of Japan, the Chinese term Shen and its Japanese equivalent Kami were used in Japan. In contrast, since American missionaries worked mainly wkh the BFBS in Korea, the Shangdi edition of the Chinese Scriptures was distributed in Korea, and Shangdi and its Korean equivalent Hanânim were eventually used in Korean Protestantism. The Shangdi camp in China signaled a new phase through the notion of "original monotheism." The Jesuits had thought that Christianity and ancient Confucianism were complementary and the latter was open to theism. Yet the Protestant Shangdists went a step further and argued that the Shangdi of the Confucian classics was synonymous with the Greek Theos and the Chinese were originally monotheistic, like the Greeks (Legge 1852, 58-59; Doty 1850, 12-3). They believed that Shangdi referred to the monotheistic God, although the ancient Chinese worshipped many lower deities. Their use of Shen for the Spirit had continuity with the Jesuits. In the 1840s, Walter H. Medhurst (1796-1857) of the London Missionary Society argued that Shangdi was the one great Supreme Ruler of Heaven whose dominion, divinity, and virtue could be found in the Chinese classics. In 1847 he wrote a book on the terms Shen and Shangdi as expressed in the Confucian classics, Daoist scriptures, and Buddhist sutras. After the examination of about 800 usages of Shen, he concluded that the word Shen had never referred to the Supreme God in Confucianism; Shen were the expanders and contractors of nature, and they were not gods, but subordinate spirits under Shangdi; and that Shen was usually used as a compound word, guishen (malicious spirits).9 In contrast he insisted that Shangdi in the Confucian and Daoist classics and the Kangxi Dictionary (1716) was the Supreme Ruler of heaven, earth, and sea (Medhurst 1847, 186-191, 246—249, 257-260). Medhurst argued that ancient Chinese attached ruling power to the Heavens, or the Ruler of Heaven and the Sovereign of Earth, "but whenunity and personality are intended to be conveyed, they use the term Supreme Ruler" (ibid. 207). His conclusion was that Shangdi</page><page sequence="8">96 Journal of Korean Religions 3/2 ■ 2012 was the substance (體 ti) of Shen，and Shen was the spiritual function (用 of Shangdi (ibid. 266, 278). He confirmed his view on Shangdi in another long dissertation in 1848, which started with the Confucian ti-yong theory (Medhurst 1848, 15). For Medhurst, Shangdi was synonymous with Tian (Heaven), Tiandi (Ruler of Heaven), and Tianzhu (Lord of Heaven).10 By contrast, Bishop William J. Boone (1811—1874) of the American Protes tant Episcopal Church denied the existence of original monotheism and primi tive revelation in ancient China just as Franciscans and Dominicans had done in the seventeenth century. In 1848, Boone argued that the Chinese were poly theists, they did not know the true God, and therefore the highest being known to them, Shangdi, should be regarded as the chief god of a pantheon. Under these circumstances, he contended that they should not choose the specific proper name Shangdi, but the generic and relative name Shen, just like the Greek NT had not adopted the name of the chief god Zeus but the generic and relative term Theos (Boone 1848, 2-4). Boone, a conservative evangelist, hinted that those who exhorted the Chinese to worship Shangdi were violating the first Commandment. He stated that Christianity could destroy the Chinese polytheistic god shen by using the Christian Shen. In order to support his view, Boone appealed to the interpretation of a French Jesuit Claude de Visdelou (1656-1737), who had insisted that Confucius never affirmed Shangdi as a creator (Boone 1850, 22). Like Visdelou, Boone referred to Zhu Xi's commen taries, which understood creation as an impersonal process beginning with the Great Ultimate (taiji), Principle (//), and Vital Energy (qi). In Korea, H. G. Underwood and his colleagues followed Boone's line and opposed the use of Hanânim in the 1890s because they regarded it as the name of the highest god of the Korean pantheon. Boone's arguments were so forceful that in January 1850 Medhurst and his five colleagues in Shanghai proposed to temporarily use Aloha (Jehovah) when the opinion of missionaries was divided between Shangdi and Shen. This compromise, however, met with no favor from anyone (Boone 1850, 3，17; Williams 1878, 746-747). But the Shenites began to lose their voice owing to the rising academic influence of James Legge of the London Missionary Society, who began the monumental task of translating volumes of Chinese classics in 1841 (more focused work began from 185フ）and completed them a few years</page><page sequence="9">Oak ■ Competing Chinese Names for God 97 before his death in 1897 (Girardot 2002, 40, 49). By 1851, more than one-third of all Protestant missionaries in China had ceased to use Shen and gradually one mission after another abandoned the term never to return to it. 2) James Legge and Shangdi The Victorian missionary James Legge (1815-1897) played a pivotal role in the Chinese term question by advocating two new concepts, Shangdi as a relative term and its original monotheism. He used Shen initially, triumphantly believ ing that the Protestant missionary enterprise was very close to the rapid conver sion of darkest Sinim China (ibid. 44). However, after spending a successful furlough in England with three young Chinese Christian students, from 1848 he redoubled his efforts to master Chinese classical literature. He accepted Medhurst's scholarship on Confucian classics and in 1848 changed his term from Shen to Shangdi, insisting that God was not a generic, but a relative term (Legge 1850, 75). He argued that both God and Shangdi referred not only to the highest God in himself, but to the relationship between himself and all other beings (Legge 1852, 2, 86; Keong 2007, 472). In other words, Shangdi was not only the self-existent and independent Being, but the personal God who created heaven and earth, ruled the world, endowed human beings with good nature, revealed himself to the ancient Chinese, heard their prayers, and was worshipped by the Chinese people. Legge supported Medhurst's idea of Shangdi of the Confucian classics as the Supreme Ruler and Shen as Spirit. However, in 1852, Legge took this a step further by insisting that monotheism, though not a pure monotheism, existed in ancient China, stating that it “is now what it was four thousand years ago," and that the God whom the Chinese worshipped was the same whom Western Christians adored because God had revealed Himself to the Chinese (Legge 1852, 38). He discovered documentary evidence for a form of Shangdi monotheism from Ming imperial worship recorded by the restorationists in the Ta Ming hui-tien (The Collected Statutes of the Great Ming Dynasty, 1511) (ibid. 24-31, 40-42; Pfister 1999, 215). Based on the idea of primitive revelation, Legge believed that monotheism preceded polytheism in China; that Shangdi</page><page sequence="10">98 Journal of Korean Religions 3/2 . 2012 in the Five Confucian classics was a different name of the monotheistic Chris tian God; and that Chinese had never debased the name in history, though they worshipped many other inferior gods and spirits (Legge 1852, 58-59, 113).11 Legge, like Matteo Ricci, depended on the metaphysical interpretation of classical Confucianism and the ritual of the imperial court. In his defense of Shangdi and criticism of the Shenites, Legge naturally re searched the Jesuit-Franciscan debate, especially the writings of Matteo Ricci and Claude de Visdelou, for Boone depended on the interpretation of Visdelou. Most of the first part of James Legge's dissertation, The Notions of the Chinese Concerning God and Spirits (1852), was devoted to the criticism of Visdelou who "was in the habit of writing extravagantly about the Chinese and carica turing their sentiments" (Legge 1852, 64). Legge respected two other Jesuit missionaries—Joseph Henri Marie de Prémare (1666—1736) and Jean-Baptiste Régis (1663-1738)一and used their interpretations of the Confucian classics to refute those of Visdelou (ibid. 69). In 1859, Legge defended Ricci's liberal method of accommodation by saying that, "About the terms I entirely agree with ms opinion, nor do I altogether differ from him about the ritual practices" (Legge 1859, 58). Legge supported the Jesuits' use of Tianzhu for God and Shen for the Spirit, for he thought Shangdi and Tianzhu were synonymous for the Chinese; both were relative terms, ana both were compound terms (Legge 1852, 129-130). But Legge preferred Shangdi to Tianzhu because Tian localized the Lord: when God and Lord came together in the biblical verses, Tianzhu (Heavenly Lord) referred to both; Shangdi (Highest Ruler) corresponded to the general idea of God of the Bible; Shangdi was an indigenous vernacular term; Tianzhu was sealed by Pope Clement XI; and finally the Protestants needed to differentiate themselves from the Roman Catholic Church (ibid. 130—131). Legge rejected Tianzhu as "a Popery invention" from his Protestant freedom. He regarded "Romism" as an exceedingly corrupted form of Chris tianity, which worshipped both the true God and multiple other beings, and insisted that ancient Chinese monotheism, like Roman Catholicism, had corrupted into polytheism, and that it worshipped both monotheistic Shangdi and other spirits (ibid. 32). In his essay entitled "Confucianism in Relation to Christianity" for the General Conference held in Shanghai in 1877, Legge, coming from Oxford,</page><page sequence="11">Oak • Competing Chinese Names for God 99 insisted that the Shangdi of the Confucian classics was the true monotheistic God, that Confucius was a man sent of God, and that Confucianism could be used as a school master to teach the Chinese the knowledge of Christianity (Legge 1877, 11). However, Legge acknowledged that as the Confucian books did not represent the time when the religion of China was purely monotheistic, there had been "from time immemorial, along with the worship of God, a corrupt and depraving admixture of the worship of other beings" (ibid. 4). Legge reiterated his view on the original monotheism of the ancient Chinese in his book The Religions of China, published in 1880. He stated, "Five thou sand years ago the Chinese were monotheists一not henotheists, but monotheists," though he adds that even then there was a constant struggle with nature-worship and divination (Legge 1880, 16). Although the worship of a monotheistic God in Confucianism ‘‘is vitiated by an inferior worsnip paid to a multitude of spirits," he maintained that this did not "amount to polytheism, for those spirits do not receive the divine name’’ (ibid. 254). Many Korean Christians and missionaries in Korea accepted Legge's arguments of the primitive mono theistic Shangdi and understood Hanànim as its equivalent. His book, The Religion of China, exerted a great influence in Korea. When H. G. Underwood published his book on East Asian religions in 1910, he used Legge's book extensively and advocated the primitive monotheism of Korean Hanànim based on Legge's understanding of Shangdi. Anglican Proposal for Tianzhu There was a third camp, the Anglicans, who advocated Tianzhu and had a strong impact on the missions in Korea in the 1890s. The first bishop of the Church of England in China, George Smith, wrote in 1851 that he preferred Tianzhu because numerous Chinese converts had been made by its century and a half usage and Protestants had adopted most other religious nomencla ture of Roman Catholicism (Blodget 1893, 6). In 1864, Robert Samuel Maclay (1824-1907) of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Fuzhou proposed using Tianzhu for God and either Shengshen or Shengling for the Holy Spirit.12 In 1865, Alexander Williamson (1829-1890), agent of the NBSS in Chefoo, wrote</page><page sequence="12">100 Journal of Korean Religions 3/2 • 2012 a paper urging missionaries to adopt Tianzhu as "the only practicable basis of union" for a new Mandarin version. The paper was signed by many veteran missionaries, including Joseph Edkins of the London Missionary Society and W. A. P. Martin of the Presbyterian Church, USA. In 1876, Maclay, who had been transferred to Tokyo in 1873, made the same suggestion, saying that "the Romish missionaries had fought the battle on the term question and settled it with Tianzhu. Why not accept their terms?" (Blodget 1893, 7) Bishop Samuel I. J. Schereschewsky (1831-1906) was its representative translator. He argued that Shangdi was not satisfactory because of its identifi cation with the Jade Emperor or Heaven, and as Shen could be used in the singular or plural, masculine or feminine, it could denote female deities, and so Shen could not be used for a monotheistic religion. His own solution, which he employed in his 1875 OT translation, was to use Tianzhu for Elohim (God), Zhu (Lord) for YHWH, and Shen for (other) gods (Schereschewsky 1888, 34— 35). Personally, he advocated the use of Shangzhu (Supreme Lord), for the Buddhists refer to Indra as Tianzhu, the lord of the thirty-two deva (gods). Moreover, by using Tianzhu, Protestants were liable to be confounded with Roman Catholics. Henry Blodget (1825—1903) of the American Board in Beijing, however, convinced Schereschewsky that Tianzhu was the best term. In 1893, Blodget argued that the entire Christian Church in China一Protestant, Roman Catholics, and Orthodox一should use a uniform term for God. The experience of eighty five years proved that Shen could not distinguish between polytheistic gods and the One God. Shangdi had been associated with the national cult and thus many Catholic and Protestant missionaries regarded Shangdi as just a chief god. Blodget insisted that Christian charity required concessions on the part of the Shangdists to the other larger groups (Blodget 1893, 3-4). He stated that Tianzhu was proper on two counts. Sima Qian's Ershiwushi (Twenty-five Histories) mentioned that the first emperor of the Qin dynasty (221-206 BCE) worshipped eight gods (shen) at the feng and shan sacrifice and one of the gods was Tianzhu. No word in Chinese had more of religious reverence attached to it than the word Tian (Heaven), and Zhu added the personal element (Eber 1999, 227).</page><page sequence="13">Oak ■ Competing Chinese Names for God 101 The Anglican proposal for the union was well accepted by younger mis sionaries in Korea as well as by senior missionaries in China.13 Unlike the Chinese Protestant missions, the Korean traditional vernacular name Hanànim (古！^ Heavenly Being) and the Chinese new name T'yônjyu (S 夺 C. Tianzhu) competed in the Korean Protestant missions in the 1890s.14 Why did many Protestant missionaries in Korea accept Tianzhu? It was because they were influenced by the discourse of the Anglicans in China. H. G. Underwood was a strong supporter of Tianzhu. Like the Shenite Henry Boone in China, he insisted that the Christian God was not a specific name but a generic term. Underwood claimed that because the use of an existing name for the native gods entailed a connection with these gods, a generic term should be selected in order to exclude them; in cases where it was not possible to find such a term, Jehovah should be used (Underwood 1904, 103-104). Then in 1897， Underwood moved toward the use of T'yônjyu (培夺）and Syangjyu (せ寺)， influenced by Henry Blodget's 1893 arguments for the uniform use of Tianzhu in China. Around 1900, Underwood became the only Presbyterian missionary in Korea opposed to the use of Hanànim. Underwood used T'yônjyu in his translation of the Scriptures and tracts, and between 1897 and 1901 he consis tently used Syangjyu in his weekly Kurisudosinmun (The Christian News). He remained in the eye of the storm during the term controversy from 1894 to 1903, and then yielded to the Hanànim camp, just as many missionaries in China yielded to the Shangdi camp. Scottish Presbyterians' Shangdi and Hanànim In the interconnection between the Chinese terms and the Korean terms for God, John Ross (1842-1915) and other Scottish missionaries in Shandong and Manchuria provided the missionaries in Seoul with important theological and linguistic discourses. They used Shangdi in Chinese Christian literature and Hanunim or Hananim (Heavenly One) in Korean Christian literature that they produced from 1877 to 1893. By using both terms and by referring to the contemporary Manchurian and Korean religiosity, they determined the adop tion of Hananim in Korean Scriptures. Here John Ross developed unique</page><page sequence="14">102 Journal of Korean Religions 3/2 ■ 2012 discourses on the original monotheism of Confucianism in ancient China, Daoism in Manchuria, and shamanism in northern Korea. John Ross was sent to Newchwang (Yingkou) in 1872 as the first missionary of the Manchurian Mission of the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland, and he worked among Koreans as well as Chinese in Manchuria until his retirement in 1910.15 Ross's Korean work is well known now.16 After some contacts with Koreans in Manchuria, Ross began to translate the Scriptures into Korean han'gul in 1877, and chose a vernacular name Hanunim (Hananim) as the term for God from his first Korean Gospels of Luke and John in 1882 to the New Testament in 1887 (Ok and Yi 1993, 31-89; 1994,105-106).17 Ross regarded Manchuria and Korea as parts of the larger cultural sphere of North east Asia, and studied the distinctive Korean language, culture, history, and religions, hoping to evangelize in Korea someday in the future.18 This vision was transferred from Alexander Williamson, a senior Scottish missionary in China since 1855 and agent of the National Bible Society of Scotland in Chefoo, Shandong. Williamson persuaded Robert J. Thomas (1839 1866) to visit Korea in 1865 and board the General Sherman as a colporteur of NBSS for the fateful voyage of 1866 to P'yôngyang. In 1867, Williamson visited the Korean Gate in Manchuria, the gateway village and the official market place between Qing China and Chosôn Korea. He distributed Scrip tures and tracts among Korean merchants there, gathered some information about Korea, yet failed to hear about the late Thomas. Williamson yearned for Great Britain and America to open Korea for mission work (Williamson 1870, 179-184, 311). Influenced by Thomas and Williamson, Ross visited the Korean Gate in 1874 and 1876 and found a Korean language teacher, Yi Ûngcn'an. After publishing the Corean Primer for future missionaries to Korea in 1877, Ross and Yi began to translate the Scriptures into Korean and the first drafts of three Gospels were completed by 1878 before Ross left for England on furlough. From 1878 Ross adopted Hanunim as an equivalent of Shangdi. Before going to Scotland, he completed the drafts of History of Corea: Ancient and Modem, and published it in 1879. In the book he argued,</page><page sequence="15">Oak ■ Competing Chinese Names for God 103 The Coreans have one native name, and one borrowed from the Chinese, for the Supreme Being. The former is Hannonim，from hanul, heaven; the latter Shangde. The name Hannonim is so distinguished and so universally used, that there will be no fear, in future translations and preaching, of the unseemly squabbles which occurred long ago among Chinese missionaries on this subject;—even though the Romanists have introduced the name which they employ in China. The idea conveyed by the term Hannonim is much like that of Tienlaoye，the popular Chinese name for the Almighty, the all-present, but invisible One. (Ross 1881a, 355) Ross understood that the etymology of Hanùnim (Hannonim) was hanul (heaven). Hanùnim meant the Heavenly Ruler and thus it was equivalent to the Chinese Shangdi. Ross contended that this term included the meaning of omnipotent, omnipresent, and invisible. On the other hand, John Maclntyre (1837—1905)，who joined Ross in 1875 and became his brother-in-law in 1876, continued the translation work with some Koreans in 1879 (Christie 1934, 78; Grayson 1984，350-352). He used Hananim, as Ross and his Korean helpers had adopted. Maclntyre baptized four Koreans, including Paek Hongjun and Yi Ûngch'an, at the Chinese Church in Newchwang in 1879 (Mclntyre 1880, 14-15; 1880a, 278-279; Ross 1880, 333—334). These were the first Protestant baptisms for Koreans. When Ross retuned to Manchuria from Scotland in 1881 he moved to Shenyang, established a press, and began to publish Korean Christian litera ture. Ross adopted Hanunim in his first two Korean tracts, Yesusônggyomundap (Bible Catechism) and Yesusônggyoyoryông (Introduction to the New Testa ment) in October 1881,19 and the first two Korean Gospels of Luke and John in the spring of 1882.20 From 1883 he then consistently used Hananim in the Korean scriptures. However, there was no change in the meaning in his shift from Hanunim to Hananim. It was just a spelling change. Its meaning remained as "Heavenly One," the Korean equivalent of Shangdi. Like other Scottish missionaries, Ross adopted Shangdi under the influence of Alexander Williamson of the NBSS and possibly James Legge (An 2009, 230-236).21 In adopting Shangdi, however, Ross had a different approach from that of James Legge. Legge depended on documentary evidence, such as</page><page sequence="16">104 Journal of Korean Religions 3/2 ■ 2012 Confucian classics and old court records. Although Ross studied Confucian classics, quoted them in his sermons, and included Confucian classics in the curricula of the mission schools, he had different sources for Shangdi as a term for God and the contemporary Chinese people's understanding of Shangdi. Ross gathered information from his target audience in Manchuria, which consisted of urban merchants and rural farmers, and tried to find the remnants of monotheistic belief in Shangdi. This fieldwork approach was applied to the search for the Korean term for God. As Ross could not enter Korea, his con tact with Koreans was limited to itinerating Korean merchants and the Korean embassies to Beijing via Manchuria. Ross depended on their religiosity and colloquial usage of Hanunim, partly because of the scarcity of available docu ments on Korean religions. On the other hand, his liberal missiology and tolerant attitude toward East Asian religions led him to find and appreciate the Korean people's monotheistic spirituality in practice. In his anthropological approach, Ross found a third source. This was Manchurian Daoism and a Daoist priest in Shenyang who worshipped Shangdi or the Jade Shangdi (玉皇上帝).Through written dialogues on the Gospel of John wdth Ross, the priest argued that the Christian concepts of Dao, Shangdi, light, darkness, and life were similar with those of Daoism, that Daoist Shangdi was also a creator who had no beginning and end, was omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent, and thus supported the concepts of Shangdi and the Heaven of primitive Confucianism, which he thought differed from the li-qi theory of Neo-Confucianism (Ross 1883, 494; 1894, 123-129). Ross thought that the Shangdi of contemporary Manchurian Daoism, the Shangdi of original Confucianism, and the Hanunim (Hananim) of contem porary Korean shamanism were very similar to the Christian God. Ross was determined to use as many vernacular Korean terms in his trans lation as possible, so it was natural for him to adopt the Korean Hanunim instead of the Chinese Shangdi. Ross obtained information about Hanùnim from Yi Ungch'an and other Korean merchants. Ross believed that the em ployment of Hanunim in Korea would not bring along the term controversy as in China, for that term was "so distinguished" from other Korean gods and "so universally used’’ among contemporary Koreans. He was well aware of the term question in China. Yet his choice of Hanùnim was based on many</page><page sequence="17">Oak • Competing Chinese Names for God 105 interviews and tests with ordinary Koreans. In adopting this term for God, Ross took a different approach from that of James Legge, who had depended on the literary Confucian classics and court records. When William E. Griffis (1843-1928) published Corea, the Hermit Nation in New York in 1882, he mentioned the Korean highest God referring to Ross's History of Corea (1879) and James Legge's The Religions of China (1880). Griffis paraphrased Ross's Hanunim as "the King or Emperor of Heaven" and identified him with the Chinese Shangdi, based on Legge's idea of primitive monotheism (Griffis 1882, 327-328). Thus, it was Griffis who linked Ross's Hanunim with Legge's primitive monotheistic Shangdi for the first time.22 As Griffis' Corea, the Hermit Nation became required reading for missionaries going to Korea, and went through nine revised editions in thirty years with the help of missionaries in Korea (Hunt 1980, 54), early Protestant missionaries in Korea must have been aware of the connections between the Korean Hanànim and the Chinese Shangdi. And through this conjunction, they might have studied the Chinese term question, James Legge's arguments, and Ross's reason for using Hananim. But Ross did not need to use the idea of primitive monotheism in his adoption of Hanùnim (Hananim) from 1881 to 1887. He knew that Koreans worshipped multiple gods and spirits of folk religions. But he found the mono theistic Hananim among many gods in Korea. The Shangdists argued that the monotheistic god Shangdi had coexisted with many lower gods in ancient China. By contrast, Ross found that the contemporary Korean monotheistic god Hananim was coexisting with many other gods. After the completion of the first Korean NT in 1887, he reaffirmed that the contemporary Korean Hananim was equivalent to the Chinese Shangdi of the classical texts. He wrote: "The Corean for 'heaven' is hanal, for ‘lord，or ‘prince’ nim, originally Chinese; and Hananim is the term by which Coreans everywhere acknowledge the Ruler above and supreme on earth" (Ross 1887a, 497). One other remarkable form of worship demands notice. In time of great drought mandarins go, not to the temple of Heaven and Earth, but outside, and standing under the great temple of the blue heaven, they look upwards and pray to Hananim for rain. By this term—"Lord of Heaven"一they</page><page sequence="18">106 Journal of Korean Religions 3/2 ■ 2012 always translate the Chinese Shangdi，the Chinese shen being by them always translate Kueishen [sic], the two being invariably combined. From all I have ever heard of the name Hananim I have felt thankful that the Koreans had a term which should prevent the shade of any difficulty regard ing the question which in older times so sadly, and may I add so unseemingly, divided the counsels of good men in China. (Ross 1880, 370) Ross tested Hananim in every way with Koreans and became convinced that the introduction of a foreign term was a serious mistake. At the same time, he rejected the Chinese Shen as the term for God, for it was understood as kwishin ("evil spirits") in Korea. He used sin for gods in John 10:30 ("You are gods.")- And in 1883 he changed the term for the Holy Spirit from Syôngsin to Syôngnyông.23 His refusal to use T'yônjyu served the purpose of differentiat ing Protestantism from Roman Catholicism, which had been persecuted as a vicious religion by the Korean government (Ross 1888, 370). Ross's adoption of the vernacular name for God, Hanunim or Hananim, was closely connected with his translation principle of using the ordinary people's colloquial language, and oi his mission policy of indigenization and the Nevius method. His introduction of Hanunim, a term that is still in use, was a signifi cant theological foundation for the development of the indigenous Korean Protestant Church. He identified the Korean people's contemporary Hanùnim with the biblical Elohim. He did not introduce a foreign god to the Koreans, but taught them that the Christian God had already been working among them. Conclusion The term question was not solved in China. The Shanghai Conferences in 1877, 1890, and 1907 could not resolve the issue. The three terms, Shen, Tianzhu, and Shangdi, coexisted in the 1890s and 1900s. The Chinese Christians pre ferred the Shangdi edition published by the British and Foreign Bible Society. In the first decade of the twentieth century, nearly all Chinese Protestants used the Shangdi edition and the Union Bible in 1919 used Shangdi.24 The Chinese</page><page sequence="19">Oak • Competing Chinese Names for God 107 liked the vernacular name and the idea that their ancient ancestors were monotheists, which was strongly defended by James Legge and other liberal evangelical missionaries and translators. The principle of vernacularism and the idea of primitive monotheism of the liberal Protestant missionaries in China influenced the Protestant missions in Korea. Unlike the Chinese Protestant missions, the Korean traditional vernacular name Hanànim (許1^ Heavenly Being) and the Chinese neologism T'yônjyu (龟夺 C. Tianzhu) competed in the Korean Protestant missions of the 1890s. The former was an indigenous name of Korean folk religions and was adopted by John Ross, who began to translate the Scriptures into Korean in 1878, whereas the latter was a Chinese term, which had the advantage of ecumenical cooperation between evangelical Protestants (Presbyterians and Methodists) with Anglicans.25 After debates over several names between 1893 and 1903, the evangelical Protestant missions decided to adopt Hanànim in the vernacular Korean texts and to use Shangdi m the Chinese texts.26 The Protestant missions in China had engagea in prolonged controversies over the term for God. By contrast, within two decades of their work those missions in Korea came to a consensus for Hanànim, partly because the missionaries in Korea could utilize the studies and controversies of China. An interesting case in Korea is that of Horace G. Underwood. Like Henry Boone in China, Underwood insisted that the Christian Ood was not a specific name but a generic term, and strongly opposed Hanànim. Instead of a tradi tional Korean name, Underwood used a coined Chinese term, T'yônjyu, until 1901. But his arguments borrowed from the Shenites were, like Boone's term Shen in China, doomed to failure. His next theological discourse was borrowed from the Anglicans in the name of ecumenism. But as there were only a small number of Anglican Koreans in Korea, their demand for the T'yônjyu edition was too small for Underwood to urge the Bible Societies to publish such editions. Underwood's position was also undermined by his Korean tracts translated from the Chinese tracts, mostly authored by Griffith John of the London Missionary Society, who used Shangdi as the term for God. In Korea, the vernacular name Hanànim coexisted with its Chinese equivalent Shangdi, for both were adopted based on the invented idea of the original monotheism.</page><page sequence="20">108 Journal of Korean Religions 3/2 ■ 2012 The Protestant term question in China clearly shows that the first genera tion Korea missions were under the strong influence of the China missions. So far, most research on the history of early Korean Protestantism has paid much attention to the trans-Pacific transmission of North American Christianity to Korea. By examining a case of the term question, this paper emphasized the trans-Yellow Sea and Manchurian-Northern Korean interactions between naturalized Chinese Protestant missions and emerging Korean Protestantism. Of course, our main concern should be the third integration, the synthesis of Anglo-American-Sino Christianity with congenial elements of Korean religions, and the Korean agency in this synthesis. But first we need a more in-depth study of the Chinese-Korean synthesis in mission theories, methods, policies, and literature to understand the early Korean Protestant Church as we do the first century of the Roman Catholic Church in Korea. Notes 1 A Chinese Christian, Tin Nico, made an altar without any idols but a panel of two letters, Tianzhu, in the service of God. Ricci accepted the term partly because its pronunciation was similar to that of Latin Deus and Italian Dio. See Ricci (1953), II-3. 2 Initially, Roman Catholics in China used Shen as the term for God. 3 Originally, Buddhists referred to Indra as Tianzhu, the lord of the thirty-two deva (gods). 4 According to Xù Shèn's Shuowen Jiezi (Etymological Dictionary of Chinese Char acters) of the Han dynasty in the second century CE, the etymology of "Tian" was "something most high over a person" (Chu 1958, 32). The oracle script of the Zhou dynasty depicted a person with a large cranium. Anthropomorphic Heaven was said to see, hear and watch over all men (Shih). Ricci's erroneous understanding of "Tian" as a compound of "one" and "great" was accepted by James Legge in 1880 (Legge 1880, 9) and G. Heber Jones in Korea in 1892 (Jones 1892, 332-333). 5 The papal bull ordered the designation of the Spirit (pneuma) as Shen. See Williams (1878), 735.</page><page sequence="21">Oak ■ Competing Chinese Names for God 109 For example, when one used Tianzhu, the Chinese translation of "my Lord and my God" (John 20:28) became "my true Lord and my heavenly Lord." See Legge (1852), 130. They were1)the Shen group:神，眞神，眞活神；2) the Di group:上帝，神天上帝，天上 上帝，眞神上帝，神天大帝，天帝，天皇，主宰，眞宰；3) the Tian group:天，上天，神天， 天父，老天爺；and 4) the Zhu group:天主，神主，眞主，上主，天帝神主.Three favorite names of Protestant missionaries were Shen, Shangdi, and Tian. See Medhurst (1848)，157-159 and Rawlinson (1928)，14. For good summaries of the term question in China, refer to Spelman (1969), Legge (1880), and Eber (1999). The first party used Shangdi for God and Shen for spirit; the second party used Shen for God and ling for spirit; and the third party used Shangdi or Tian for God, shen for gods (false gods), and ling for spirit (S. W. Williams, op. cit, 788). Chang Tsai's dictum, "The negative spirit (kuei) and positive spirit {shen) are the spontaneous activity of the two material forces (yin and yang)^ has become the generally accepted dennition in China. See Chan (1963), 790. To the Chinese (and Koreans), the concept of a supreme god had not been prob lematic because "the pervasive bureaucratic metaphor of Chinese religion" easily acknowledged a top figure. See Jordan (1993), 290. The idea of a pre-Christian supernatural primitive monotheism argued that God had revealed monotheistic religion to humankind, since which time humankind had degenerated into polytheism, totemism, and fetishism, though Christianity was exempt from this degeneration. Maclay was a pioneer Methodist missionary in Cnina from 1847, and then Japan from 1873. Dr. and Mrs. Maclay visited Seoul in June 1884 and obtained royal permission to establish a mission school and hospital. The Board of the translators of the Korean Scriptures decided to use T'yônjyu in 1894. For a history of the term question in the Protestant Church in Korea, see Oak (2002). The United Presbyterian Church of Scotland was formed in 1847 and in 1900 merged with the Free Church of Scotland to form the United Free Church of Scotland. It was the third largest Presbyterian Church in Scotland and stood on its liberal wing. See Grayson (1982) and Oak and Yi, eds. (2004).</page><page sequence="22">110 Journal of Korean Religions 3/2 . 2012 17 In 1883 Ross changed the spelling of Hanunim to Hananim. This was the result of his effort to simplify the phonetic value of which had been pronounced as (a) or (ù), into (a). There was no change in his understanding of the meaning of the name. 18 See Ross (1880, 1881a) and Grayson (1984). 19 Ross's Bible Catechism was revised by Mrs. Mary F. Scranton and published in Seoul in 1892. It was widely used by Methodists and Presbyterians in Seoul. See Hall (1893). 20 Ross's first principle of translation was "an absolute literal translation compatible with the meaning of the passages and the idiom of the Corean language." But his actual translation had to accept many Korean idioms (See J. Ross to William Wright, January 24,1883, in Oak 2004, 63-65). This moderately dynamic equiva lent translation might have been another factor in Ross accepting the indigenous term Hananim. 21 An does not mention the influence of senior Scottish missionaries on Ross. He assumes Ross was influenced by Legge when they met in London in 1879, but Ross had already adopted Hananim as the Korean term for God before meeting Legge. 22 Like James Legge at Oxford, Ross regarded Confucianism as a schoolmaster or handmaid to drive the Chinese to Christ (Ross 1877, 409-411; 1906, 250). Like Legge, Ross thought highly of the Jesuit mission's methods and great success in China and their good influence in Korea. Ross evaluated the Jesuits as "in a sense Protestants" because they acted independently of Rome. Yet he criticized French missionaries in China and Korea who were connected with French military power (Ross 1881a, 291-294). When Ross's book, History of Corea: Ancient and Modern, was published in 1879, Legge quoted its comment on Daoism—"which divides Chinese attention with Buddhism, is almost unknown in Corea" (p. 355)一in his book, The Religions in China (Legge 1880, 230). Legge sent Ross a copy of the Oxford edition of Palmer's The Greek New Testament (1881) and its English edition (RV) as soon as they were published. Ross used them as the basis for his translation of the Korean NT from 1881 to 1887. So the Ross Version became the first trans lation based upon the critical texts of the Revised Version copies of the Greek and English NT (See Ross to William Wright, March 24,1882 &amp; March 28,1889, in Oak 2004, 35,133). Hence, Ross omitted the story of the woman caught in adultery of John 8:1-11 in his Korean Gospel of John of 1882 (See Ross to William Wright, January 24 &amp; July 22 1883 in Oak 2004, 63—65，82-83). But from 1883, Ross inserted these verses at the request of the BFBS, which financially supported Ross's translation and publication. Ross believed that the original religion of the Chinese,</page><page sequence="23">Oak ■ Competing Chinese Names for God 111 though not henotheism, was monotheism like that of the ancient Jews (Ross 1909, 20-21). Later, Ross stated that "there has been no greater Chinese scholar" than Legge (Ross 1916, 59). Thus, we can assume that Ross, influenced by Legge, used Shangdi of the Confucian classics as the Christian monotheistic God (Ross 1906, 247-248; 1916, 91,97), and that Ross's adoption of Hanùnim might have been partly influenced by Legge's idea of primitive monotheism. 23 Thus the Korean Scriptures used Syôngnyông for the Holy Spirit from 1883 to 1893, yet they used Syôngsin from 1895 to 1936. 24 The sales of the Shangdi edition increased rapidly in the 1900s: 38,500 copies (11.6%) in 1894, 299,000 copies (78.9%) in 1908, and 1,708,000 copies (99.7%) in 1913 (Zetzsche 1999a, 88). 25 The following were used as the Korean names for God at this time:許Hanunim, 斜Vg Hanânim,許14ゼ Hananim,尅吾（天主）T'yônjyu,せ句1(上帝）Syangdye, -tl(神） Sin,过ゼ（眞神）Chinsin, (眞神）Ch'amsin,吾（主）Chyu, and せ吾（上主）Syangjyu. 26 In the controversy, Syangdye (C. Shangdi) had been dropped earlier, for it was used in the Chinese Scriptures and literature. The coexistence of the Korean Hanànim, which came from Korean shamanism and was favored by American missionaries, and the Chinese Shangdi, which came from original Confucianism and was favored by British missionaries, revealed that Korean religions and Christianity had distinc tive identities.
