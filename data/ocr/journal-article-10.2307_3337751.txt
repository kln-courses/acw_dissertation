<plain_text><page sequence="1">e x h i b i t i o n p r e v iew ART AND ORACLE Spirit Voices of Africa ALSA GAM MA C urated by Alisa LaGamma, the exhibition "Art and Oracle: Spirit Voices of Africa," opening at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, on April 26 and running through July 30, will include approximately 200 works selectedfrom public and private collections in the United States and abroad. The companion catalogue, Art and Oracle: African Art and Rituals of Divination, is by LaGamma, with an essay by John Pemberton III. Published by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and distributed by Harry N. Abrams, New York (80 pp., 5 b/w and 50 color photos, $19.95 softcover), it illustrates fifty of the most representative works in the exhibition and includes extended commentaries on their significance. Upon the opening of "Art and Oracle," the museum plans to launch an electronic version of the catalogue on its Web site (www.metmuseum.org). It will feature an additional section, organized by the University of the Witwatersrand Art Galleries in Johannesburg, presenting objects from South African museum collections with discussion by South African scholars. Other MMA curatorial departments will also participate in the electronic catalogue, contributing works from other parts of the world that relate to the exhibition theme. The text in this article has been adapted from the catalogue's introductory statement.

Two collaborative exhibitions, one at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and an earlier one at the Museum Rietberg, Zurich, take cross-cultural approaches to exploring the influence of divination on forms of visual expression. "Art and Oracle: Looking into the Future" at the Rietberg (November 14, 1999-February 20, 2000) celebrated divination practices throughout history and the world-from ancient Greece to modem-day Africa. "Art and Oracle: Spirit Voices of Africa" at the Metropolitan draws upon the African com- ponent of the Rietberg exhibition and adds works from American collections. These exhibitions take their inspiration from a 1996 symposium organized by John Pemberton III at Amherst College. Pemberton is the editor of a volume called Insight and Artistry, to be published by the Smithsonian Institution Press, which stems from the pro- ceedings of the Amherst meeting. In 1998 he organized an exhibition at the Mead Art Museum, "The Artist's Eye: The Diviner's Insight," that drew upon the African art col- lection of the late Barry D. Maurer. The treatment of the subject at the Metropolitan is even 52 atrican arts ? spring 2000</page><page sequence="2">more comprehensive, expanding upon the discussion of diviner's implements in the scholarship to present a broader view of this theme within the African art corpus. Throughout history, peoples everywhere have sought the intervention of divine powers to understand their fate. "Art and Oracle" presents African artifacts created to communicate with gods, ancestors, and other spirits in order to obtain insight into human quandaries and thereby offer potential avenues for resolving them. "To divine" means to foretell future events or to discover hidden knowledge by supernatural means. In Africa the efforts to do so are evidenced by objects that display an especial- ly broad range of artistic expression. This exhibition assembles a selection of these from some fifty African cultures. Their designs were usually joint endeavors, combin- ing the skill and creative talent of artists with the expertise of ritual specialists. In some instances this collaboration gave form to divination instruments used by the specialist to tap into otherwise inaccessible knowledge; in others they led to the creation of objects prescribed for use by the diviner's clients. The results range from basic utili- tarian implements to masterpieces that reflect the highest level of execution and inge- nuity. "Art and Oracle" focuses on some of the most imaginative works of African art inspired by the human quest to reach beyond the limits of ordinary experience. spring 2000 ? african arts Left: 1.

Their compelling visual appeal enhanced their effectiveness, for a client perceived their aesthetic merits as a measure of potency and the diviner's standing. Thus diviners have often commissioned works of transcendent artistry to convey their great status, power, and professional competence. Acting on their advice, clients commission objects as well, ranging from personal amulets to sculptures placed on altars. Similarly, attractiveness to the petitioned spirit appears to be a factor in their efficacy. The diviner or suppliant frequently seeks recourse to spiritual entities through dreams or divination rites to learn the most appropriate design elements to be communicated to the artist. Those who gain the services of the most accomplished artists acquire an invaluable asset: a work eloquently embodying cri- teria that makes it especially effective. "Art and Oracle" considers the broader complex of ideas, religious beliefs, and rit- ual practices affecting the creation of divination instruments and the pressing concerns they address. In his contribution to the exhibition catalogue, John Pemberton III has selected the Zande, Luba and Songye, Yaka, Yoruba, and Malagasy models as repre- sentatives of some of the most widespread or distinctive forms of divination in African cultures, and as points of departure for examining the religious and social structures to which they relate. He considers the nature of the concerns and problems that are analyzed through divination, from chronic ailments to marital infidelity, and the spe- cific divination techniques that have been developed to provide people with insight into their current dilemmas and give them direction for future action. Each of the two hundred or so works in the exhibition is examined from its distinct cultural perspective. As a group they reveal the commonalities and contrasts among the different divination methods and the cultures in which they developed. Whatever their relationship to the divination process, all of them appear to have been designed to awak- en the senses to knowledge that is not accessible through ordinary powers of perception. The exhibition is divided into eight cross-cultural categories. The first one, "Oracular Sculpture: Figurative Divination Instruments," features figurative sculptures that served as mediums through which a spirit world might be addressed and a divinity's revela- tions transmitted. Among these are the male and female figures utilized by a Baule diviner (Fig. 1), sublimely elegant expressions of cultural refinement; the powerfully intimidating physical presence and moral authority of a towering Yombe nkisi nkondi fig- ure (Fig. 2); and the indeterminate human silhouette of a shrouded kafigeledjo carving once used in inquiries by Senufo elders (Fig. 3). Irrespective of their culture of origin, these creations embody abstract spiritual forces, serving as transitional sites that allow these ephemeral entities to communicate with the living. This is the primary motivation underlying the patronage of Baule trance diviners and Senufo Sando diviners today, who commission artists to make aesthetically appealing images that flatter and attract the spirit world (Figs. 4-6). Many of these draw inspiration from-and idealize-the human form, which suggests that in these cultures humankind is the ultimate measure of beauty and stands at the center of world views as different as those of the Sherbro of Sierra Leone (Fig. 7) and the Lumbo of Gabon (Fig. 8). Instruments used in the Yoruba divination system known as Ifa are the focus of the section "Visual Metaphors: Ifa Divination Instruments." The objects displayed here enabled diviners to invoke the Yoruba deity of wisdom, Orunmila, and transcribe his insights, while at the same time providing him with offerings of great beauty. Through a rich language of visual metaphors, the artists conveyed their concept of the cosmos and the forces that animate it. Examples include an ordinary gourd inscribed with a diagram of the two hemispheres of Yoruba existence, and a costly ivory vessel sup- ported by human figures, designed to hold the sixteen sacred palm nuts cast by divin- ers during consultations (Fig. 9). Ifa rites provide an avenue of communication between the world of the spirits and that of the living, initiated when the diviner strikes a tapper, iroke Ifa, on the flat surface of a wooden tray, opon Ifa (Fig. 10).

"Dynamic Devices: Kinetic Oraces" considers an array of devices designed to provide revelations through various forms of physical manipulation. A mechanism inside the dou- ble chamber of the Baule oracle known as gbekre records the movements of mice, which are subsequently interpreted as cues to a client's situation. Among the divination instruments developed by Pende diviners and sculptors earlier in this century, njinda, a wild and unset- tling otherworldly apparition, responded to inquiries by leaning from side to side, where- as the flexible accordionlike form of galukoji (Fig. 11) sprang upward when the name of a guilty party was pronounced. Across central Africa, answers to questions posed by divin- ers are indicated through the movements of handheld devices known as friction oraces. Sculptors carve these instruments in a variety of anthropomorphic or zoomorphic repre- sentations that allude to beings endowed with especially acute sensory powers. The dynamic nature of the divination process is further illustrated through the works featured in "Visual Commentaries: Sets of Divination Signs." Each set consists of elemen- tal signs compiled by a diviner to create a universe in miniature. Such divination instru- ments owned by Songye (Fig. 12) and Chokwe diviners incorporate an extensive range of substances: bits of mineral, plant, and animal matter as well as miniature figurative ele- ments carved in various conventionalized motifs, contained in a gourd or basket. A com- parable Shona system uses ivory or wooden dice (hakata) inscribed with four standardized signs that resonate with that culture's larger social and spiritual precepts. When shaken or cast, the components of these divination sets fall into configurations that atrican arts ? spring 2000</page><page sequence="6">)4 03 o o m, C-i Un V1</page><page sequence="7">10.

Peter and Veena Schnell Collection. 58 are regarded as a visual commentary arranged by spiritual forces. The diviner interprets them in terms of their relevance to an individual's concerns. The same organic ingredi- ents used in the sets and whose significance is deciphered by Songye diviners may also be integrated into a power figure (nkishi), the joint effort of a diviner and a sculptor, which functions as an object of symbolic interaction between the diviner and the ancestral realm (Fig. 13). A similar collaboration characterizes Shona artists and diviners, who are pow- erfully linked by their common quest for inspiration from the spirit world. The important role of music as a medium of communication and artistic expression in divination contexts is recognized in "Invoking the Spirits: Musical Devices." The sounds produced by these musical instruments serve as essential catalysts in the div- ination process (Fig. 14). As part of a public theatrical spectacle, a Baule diviner beats a finely carved wooden mallet (Figs. 15,16) against an iron gong during a divination ses- sion and enters a state of trance and then possession, enabling nature spirits to con- tribute their insights. Similarly Senufo diviners invoke spirit entities through a display atrican arts ? spring 2000</page><page sequence="8">combining compelling artifacts and musical overtures. In Yaka society the hollowed fig- ural form of a slitdrum serves as a mouthpiece for the spirit world when it is struck, producing a sound that is regarded as an oracular pronouncement. The works featured in "Emblems of Enlightenment and Power: Diviners' Insignia" provide focal points for exploring the complex identity of the diviner, and his or her exalted status and important social role. The beaded bag in which Yoruba diviners carry their instruments is an emblematic yet highly personalized accessory, emblazoned with dynamic graphic designs (Fig. 17). Like the ivory used for making divination tappers and vessels, beads were a costly material restricted to the elite in Yoruba society. In this context they are used to comment on the diviner's role as a sacred mediator. The power and influence wielded by individuals who occupy this position in Yombe society is suggested by the idealiTPd representation of a diviner's mask, whose height- ened realism and meditative expression inspired confidence in the wearer's powers of perception (Fig. 18).

The Basinjom masquerade, performed along the Cameroon-Nigeria border, employs an antiaesthetic amalgam of carefully selected natural matter that intimidates viewers, endows extraordi- nary powers of perception upon the wearer, and dramatically suggests the arsenal of powers at its command (Fig. 20). This emphasis on harnessing the elements of the natur- al world and on mastering and knowing the properties of its animal and plant life is also reflected in the abstract beauty and harmonious design of a necklace once worn by a Barambo diviner. A comparable emphasis on regalia that features visual allusions to mas- tery of mystical knowledge is seen in "power jewelry" worn by Kongo diviners. A neck- lace with an eyelike mirror, possibly a divination device, is encircled by a fringe of knotted cords that metaphorically refers to its owner's ability to arrest spirit forces (Fig. 21). Then there is a broad range of sculptures prescribed for individual clients. These works, the result of consultations with diviners, are presented in "Empowering the Individual: Diviner's Prescriptions." They are usually highly personalized, created in response to the particular needs of individuals as they arise.

The miniature pendants worn by Nunuma, Nuna, Senufo, Tuysa, Lobi, and Bobo individuals are prescribed by a diviner to shield them from harm (Fig. 25); the iconography of such images is customized so that it relates directly to the identity of the patron. Although little idiosyncratic detail is discernible in the highly reductive, abstract design of Moba shrine figures, they too are closely tied to the well-being of a specific household. The pervasive influence of divination in many African cultures is suggested in the final section, "The Iconography of Divination: Monuments of Divine Inspiration." Though not divination instruments, these works evoke the subject. Many of them sur- vive as impressive visual documents of the quest for insight by individuals now long forgotten. Several were commissioned by African leaders before colonialism, created in response to auguries concerning their particular destinies. The sixteenth-century cast-brass plaque from the kingdom of Benin immortalizes the triumph of an Edo ruler (Fig. 26): on the eve of a conflict with a formidable enemy, King Esigie defied warnings of the bird of prophecy that his army was destined to be defeated. Unequaled in their expressive power, the works in this section eloquently convey to contemporary view- ers the personal aspirations of their royal patrons. The gleaming copper-alloy divination portrait of King Glele (r. 1858-89), in the guise of the armed war god Gu, projects a sense of invulnerability and martial strength at the height of Dahomey's power (Fig. 27). Glele's son Gbehanzin (r. 1889-94), however, inher- ited the kingdom on the eve of its defeat by the French. His consuming preoccupation with keeping that enemy force at bay is reflected in a life-size representation of a surre- alistic creature that fuses fish and human features, commissioned before his exile to Martinique (Fig. 28). Protective bocio such as these two images were prescribed by Fon priests and diviners to promote health and well-being. Another work, a Yoruba carved wooden door by one of Africa's most celebrated artists of the last century, Olowe of Ise, directly evokes divination in its depiction of an Ifa divination tray surrounded by flocks of birds. Its masterly composition and accessible imagery express the central importance of divination as the ultimate avenue to enlightenment in Yoruba society. Drawing on an established visual vocabulary, Olowe combines references to the diviner's primary investigative tool-a divination tray-and metaphysical concepts of life force and per- sonal destiny, suggested by the bird imagery.

The works presented in "Art and Oracle" were designed to capture the attention of the spirit world, whether through the efforts of highly accomplished artists in sculptures that evoke or celebrate spiritual forces or through the application of unrefined organic matter that represents the distillation of a diviner's knowledge. They were created to connect personal concerns to those of higher powers, and thus to benefit from insights that lie beyond the scope of ordinary human perception. As with most religious art, this goal was achieved through images that use the familiar as a point of departure; they are compara- ble to Western Christian representations, such as a medieval triptych or a Renaissance painter's fresco, illustrating the concepts of transubstantiation or resurrection. In explor- ing the nexus of spiritual belief and artistic expression embodied by many distinctive African artistic traditions, "Art and Oracle" illustrates some of the many means by which African cultures seek to transcend the limitations of human knowledge by reaching out for intervention and protection from the realm of the divine.
