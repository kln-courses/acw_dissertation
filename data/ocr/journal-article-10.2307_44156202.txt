The birth story of Buddha is very rich with myths and symbolisms. There are various texts such as Mahapadana Sutta, Mahavastu , Lalitha Vi s tar a, Buddha Charita , Nidana Katha and Abhinishkramana Sutra which provide glimpses of numerous legends about the life of the Buddha. The term Buddha means the 'enlightened', and Buddha is someone who proclaims the truth to the world after enlightenment. In the Buddhist tradition there are as many twenty four Buddhas, and Siddhartha Gautama Buddha is one among them. However, in this paper the term 'Buddha' is used specifically to describe the historic figure of prince Siddhartha. Prediction of the Birth of the Buddha I would like to begin with Bodhisattva Sumedha's story, as the seed of Buddha's birth is sowed in this story. Bodhisattva is someone who takes the pledge to attain enlightenment by practicing the ten paramita or perfections - giving, morality, renunciation, wisdom, energy, patience, truth, resolution, love, and equanimity. Incalculable aeons ago Bodhisattava Sumedha was born at Amaravati in the house of a wealthy brahman. Wealth and material pleasure did not satisfy him, so he renounced the wealth and started living an ascetic life. Later on when he happened to meet Dipankara Buddha, he worshipped him and made a vow at his feet that he would become Buddha someday. Dipankara Buddha also declared that Sumedha would be born as Gautama Buddha. Likewise Sumedha had to take more than five hundred births for practicing the ten perfections to attain enlightenment. The five hundred forty birth stories of the Buddha were mentioned in the Khudaka Nikaya of Sutta Pitaka of Tipitaka known as Jataka story. At last he reached the Tushita heąven and stayed till the last birth as Gautama Buddha. Birth of Buddha The suitable place for his birth was Jambudvipa, i.e. India, and the house chosen was of king Suddhodhana and queen Maya. Suddhodhana</page><page sequence="2">164 IHC : Proceedings , 73rd Session, 2012 was the wisest king of his time and his queen Maya Devi was the pearl among women. It was midsummer full moon night and queen Maya had a very strange dream that four guardians of the quarters took her to the Himalayas, there she took bath in a lake and laid down on a heavenly couch. Then she saw that a white elephant, bearing a white lotus in his trunk, walked thrice round her couch and seemed to touch her right side to enter her womb. The very next day, queen Maya's dream was told to the king Suddhodana and it was interpreted in his court by renowned astrologers and scholars, and they predicted that the king Suddhodana will become the father of a great son very soon. Nearly after ten months the queen Maya expressed her desire to visit her parents' house, and on the way from Kapilvastu to Devadaha, near Lumbini, she delivered a baby standing under the saal tree. At that moment four celestial beings came with golden net to receive the Bodhisattva. When the new born was freed from the hands of human beings, he stood on earth and took seven steps and roared !ike a lion. On this very day seven other beings also came into existence: Bodhi- tree, Yashodhara, four vases of treasure, his elephant, his horse Kantaka, his charioteer Chhana, and Kaludayin, the minister 's son. There were thirty two major marks as well as eighty minor marks on the body of the child, which indicated his future greatness. The birih of Buddha was an occasion of rejoice, so thirty three gods, and sage Asita proceeded to Kapilavastu to see the new born boy. The sage Asita after observing all the major and minor marks on the body of the baby boy predicted that one day the boy would become either a universal monarch or a fully enlightened Buddha. This incident became so popular in later period too that it is nicely and magnificently represented in art and sculpture in India as well as other regions of the world. This above mentioned story is reflected in the Buddhist art and sculptures of Andhradesa, a region presently known as Andhra Pradesh situated in the southern part of ¿he Indian subcontinent. Andhradesa and Buddhist Art The present Andhra Pradesh is one of the regions in India having the maximum number of Buddhist sites.. Especially the Krishna valley witnessed profuse patronage to Buddhism. Numerous Buddhist sites were discovered on the ancient trade routes and the flourishing Krishna- Godavari river valleys. The style and the form of Andhra art were so dominant that it got a separate identity called Amaravati School of Art. E.B. Havell finds its similarity with Ajanta paintings and says that the bas-relief of Amaravati should properly be studied in connection with the fresco paintings of Ajanta.1 Fergusson says that the treatment of</page><page sequence="3">Ancient India 165 Amaravati is original and local.2 A.K. Coomarasw?my says that it is the most voluptuous and most delicate flower of Indian sculpture.3 Stella Kramrisch summarizes, "the wildest transports of joys are alternating with outbursts of violent passion into intensified instance of life."4 S. K. Saraswati says that in Amaravati art the artist tries to express the love of life and the joy of existence. The depiction of female grace and elegance is praiseworthy.5 Aniconism in Buddhist Art When we look at the sculptures of Andhradesa we see the depiction of all the above mentioned stories. However in these art works we do not find the depiction of child Siddhartha. His presence is generally understood with a pair of footprints. Such kind of art is known as aniconic art, as the human figured image of Buddha is absent and his presence is understood with certain symbols. Speculations regarding the reason for not showing anthropomorphic images of Buddha have been a common topic among the scholars. In the beginning scholars like A. Foucher6 explained that it was not in the custom to do so. Foucher supported the Gandhara origin of Buddha's image, so he meant that Indians learnt this art from the Greco-Roman culture. Later on it was referred in the Encyclopedia of Religion that Buddha as a personality was deemed to have passed outside of history altogether at his parinarvana , his presence was instead symbolized by footprints, bodhi tree, and so on.7 Susan L Huntington is of the opinion that it is not the aniconic representation of the Buddha, but rather it is the worship of the sacred Buddhist site.8 Vidya Dehejia subscribes to the view of multiplicity of meanings in early Buddhist art.9 She has used three concepts: icon, index and symbol to describe Buddhist aniconic art.10 Some of the sculptures are briefly discussed here on this particular theme. Description of Sculptures Fig.l. is a very beautiful monoscenic narrative of Dipankara Buddha along with Sumedha which is found from Nagarjunkonda. Monoscenic narrative is a technical term meaning the depiction of a single event in a story.11 This slightly eroded panel is dated 3rd-4th century CE. Fig. 1 : Dipankar Buddha, Nagarjunkonda</page><page sequence="4">166 IHC: Proceedings, 73rd Session, 2012 Here Dipankara Buddha is shown in abhaya mudra with a halo behind his head. Sumedha is shown laying himself in mud to enable Dipankar Buddha walk over his hair comfortably. At this very moment Sumedha made the vow of becoming Buddha someday and got Dipankara Buddha's blessings. One lady is also shown in this panel. She probably was the one from whom Sumedha bought the flower for worshipping and in the last birth she became Yashodhara. In the sequence òf birth scene of Siddharth Gautama Buddha, the first episode is the dream of Maya. It is depicted in the major sites of Andhradesa such as, Amravati, Ghantasala, and Nagarjunkonda. Fig. 2 is the low relief carving from Ghantasala dated 2nd-3rd century CE. In this panel Queen Maya is shown lying on the couch, female attendants are shown sleeping, and four lokapalas or the celestial beings are shown standing at the corners. Here an elephant is also shown entering in Maya's womb. The birth scene in Lumbini (see Fig. 3.) is the most favorite depiction of all the major sites of Andhradesa. Here is the monoscenic narrative from Nandeyapalem. It is dated first century common era. In this depiction the graceful Maya Devi is shown holding a branch of saal tree. Queen Maya is surrounded by her attendants shown in anjuli mudra. Decorated water pot is carved at the lower portion of the panel. Four guardians are shown holding a piece of cloth. Fig. 2. Dream of Maya, Ghantasala Fig. 3. Birth of Buddha, Nandeyapalem They all are wearing turban and decorated with heavy jewelry. The baby Siddharth's presence at the center of the panel is indicated by empty space above which hover a parasol. It's an indexical sign pointing to the presence of the baby. Indexical sign has been described as the physical manifestation of a cause and as a direct pointer to that object, it includes physical traces such as footprints, imprint, cast shadow, etc.12 On the top of the panel devatas and kinnaras are shown hovering over with garlands and flowers.</page><page sequence="5">Ancient India 1 67 Drum friezes from Amaravati (see Fig. 4) presents continuous narratives, which revolve around the birth episode of Buddha. Continuous narratives depict successive events of an episode of a story within a single enframed unit, repeating the figure of the protagonist in the course of the narrative.13 From the left of this drum frieze first frame is shown the Buddha sitting in Tushita heaven before his birth on earth. He is circled by devatas, all are in anjuli mudra. The middle frame is depicting elephant on the top accompanied by a number of devatas dancing and playing with musical instruments. Further right is the depiction of Maya's dream, which has much similarity with the above mentioned Ghantasala's panel. Another panel (see Fig. 5) seems to be the continuation of the just mentioned story. Here in the left portion is the scene of Suddhodana's court, where Maya's dream is getting interpreted. The middle portion is the birth and adoration of the infant Siddhartha. Fig. 4. Initiation of Buddha legend, Amaravati. Courtesy Vidya Dehejia. Fig. 5. Interpretation of Dream, and the birth, Amaravati. Courtesy Vidya Dehejia Another beautiful slab (see Fig. 6) also represents the continuous narratives of the birth of Buddha. This is a much decorated and well preserved dome slab from Nagarjunkonda dated between 3rd-4th century CE. In the central register of this slab is the illustration of birth scene in Lumbini. After giving birth Queen Maya is standing by holding a branch of saal tree. The presence of a water pot in the foreground suggests that first bath is over. Four celestial beings are holding the cloth which has seven infant footprints; this is an indexical trace that Buddha has just taken the seven steps. The lower</page><page sequence="6">168 IHÇ: Proceedings , 73rd Session, 2012 portion of this register is the court scene of King Suddhodana, where Indra and the other devatas have com^ to see the baby. Then the story goes to the upper register, divided into two frames. In the left side the baby is presented to the sakya deity, and to the right is the depiction of sage Asita's prediction abot t the infant. In both of the framed panels the baby's presence is understood with the indexical sign of footprints on the cloth. Fig. 6. Sequence of Birth Scene, Nagarjunkonda Conclusion Andhradesa art can be divided into three stages: pre-Satavahana, Satavahana, and Ikshvaku period. In the pre-Satavahana period we do not find the depiction of birth scene of Buddha. We see the initiation of the depiction of the birth scene of the Buddha from different sites of Andhradesa during the Satavahana period that is 1st century CE, which continued till the Ikshvaku period. In the beginning we also find the monoscenic narrative of the dream of Maya, and the birth scene of the Buddha. However later on from the major sites we start getting the continuous narratives of the birth story. However, we do not find the anthropomorphic depiction of child Siddhartha in the art work. His presence is understood with a pair of footprints on the cloth, and parasol hovering over empty space. Dipankar Buddha's episode is much similar to the Gandhara depiction, as is also found at Nagarjunkonda. Thus, we can say that the Buddhist art of Andhradesa has faithfully depicted all the episodes related to the birth story of the Buddha. NOTESAND REFERENCES 1. E.B.
