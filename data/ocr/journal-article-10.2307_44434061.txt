Ray Buckendale Lectures provide an annual auto- motive engineering lecture dealing with commercial or military ground vehicles for on- or off-road operations. The objective of the Lectures is to provide procedures and data useful in the solution of design problems. The intent is to present the young engineer with up-to-date practical knowledge not generally available in textbooks. The lectures were established in 1954 in memory of L. Ray Buckendąle, 1964 SAE President, by Rockwell-Standard with funds from the Plan for Administration. Foremost among Mr. Buckendale's interests was the desire to develop the latent abilities in young engineers. As he was an authority in the theory and practice of gearing as applied to automotive ve- hicles, it was in this field that he was best able to accomplish this purpose. A special committee selects the topic to be covered each year and the lecturer most qualified to discuss the subject chosen. PRINCIPLES AND DESIGN OF MECHANICAL TRUCK TRANSMISSIONS The paper discusses the function of the diesel truck transmission and gives formulae for the determination of the correct combina- tion of speed and torque necessary to overcome resistance to the motion of the vehicle. Ratio steps are determined and arranged, and design details are given. The capacity of gears, bearings, and multiple countershaft designs are calculated. Ratios for transmission types and shifting are determined. CHARLES M. PERKINS EATON CORP. Charles M.

Papers are judged primarily for their value as new contributions to exist- ing knowledge of the art of such adaptation. One of Harry L. Homing's deep interests was the establish- ment of a broadly cooperative agency devoted to the better mutual adaptation through experimental effort of fuels and internal combustion engines, including the development of an internationally recognized standard for testing fuels. He was a major force in the movement to bring the automotive and pe- troleum industries together to deal with the fuel problem. THE INFLUENCE OF FUEL PROPERTIES ON METERING IN CARBURETORS This paper considers the influence of the properties of gasolines and testing fluids on metering by carburetors. Since the fuel meter- ing is controlled by orifices, the effects of fuel properties on orifice flow are analyzed. The results of an orifice testing program are presented, using the Reynolds number as the primary correlation parameter. The influences of fuel type, fuel temperature, and orifice geometry on the discharge coefficient are discussed, and the effect of a given fuel property change is shown. Experimental values for the variations in fluid properties with fuel type and temperature are presented for commercial gasolines, carburetor testing fluids, and pure hydrocarbons. The variation of carbon-to-hydrogen ratio among gasolines is shown to cause a change in stoićhio metry, which is the equivalent of an error in metering. S. J.

The recipient is invited to present a lecture on an appropriate subject. This is the award for 1970. THE AUTOMOTIVE ENGINE- TODAY AND TOMORROW Automotive engine output and efficiency have greatly improved over the years due to the combined efforts of the automotive and petroleum industries. As compression ratios and octane ratings of fuels have increased, the automotive engineer has been able to give the customer more for his money in either economy or performance, or a combination of both. A brief history of these developments should serve to point to the problems of the future, since octane requirements of the 1971 models have been generally reduced to enable the automobile manufacturer to meet the stringent exhaust emission standards. Since lead antiknocks are the most economical and widely used method of increasing the octane rating of gasoline, their effects on engine parameters such as durability, ORI, and emissions will be compared with lead-free gasolines. The economic impact of the change from the 94 and 100 octane number fuels to a 91 octane lead-free gasoline will be presented. Consideration will be given to the question of how much control from automobiles is really needed to achieve a satisfactory level of ambient air quality. The future of the piston engine, as well as possible substitutes, is discussed in view of the stringent emission controls proposed for 1975 and 1976. A critical review of both the ambient air quality and emission standards indicates the need for revisions and a careful evalua- tion of the cost-benefit ratio, so that the passenger car buyer will not be needlessly penalized with both high initial costs and high operating costs. The potential waste of our national resources must also receive consideration. MAX M. ROENSCH Max M. Roensch began his automotive career at Chrysler Corp. in 1926.

COLWELL MERIT AWARD Recognizing that more than one truly outstanding technical paper may be presented in a given year, there is no restriction in this award on the number of authors who may be honored. Rather, the award is presented to all who have demonstrated, by the quality of their (technical paper, a degree of profession- alism that leaves no cause for criticism. The emphasis in judg- ing for the award lies heavily on the originality of the contri- bution to automotive engineering, as well as on the excellence of presentation. This is in recognition of the necessity for the technical community to establish clear and concise lines of communication. There is no restriction on subject. Arch T. Colwell himself is a prime example of the desire for excellence in development and presentation of technical pa- pers. During his career as vice president of Thompson Prod- ucts Inc. and later in the succeeding TRW Inc. he personally followed the creation of each technical paper developed by the company's engineers to see that it was a credit both to the best talents of the individual and project it represented. The Award which he established aims to encourage this sense of profes- sionalism in the engineering profession.
