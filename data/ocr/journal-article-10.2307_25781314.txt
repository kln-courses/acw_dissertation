<plain_text><page sequence="1">"INTEGRITY IN A SURPLICE": Samuel Beckett's (Post-)Protestant Poetics Sinead Mooney This essay takes as its starting point a remark made by Beckett in a 1932 letter to Thomas McGreevy in which he dubs himself "a dirty low-church P[rotestant] even in poetry, concerned with integrity in a surplice". Here, Beckett seems to be ruefully deriving an aesthetic position from one of the unpalatable givens of the often virulent sectarian rhetoric of the Ireland of the 1930s. I argue that this Irish Protestant sense of marginality and exclusion from a theocratic cultural mainstream provides the bedrock for Beckett's increasingly puritan probing of the quintessential^ Protestant themes of examination of conscience and autobiography and iconoclasm. Jesuitical: 1. Of or pertaining to the Society of Jesus; belonging to the Society of Jesus; Jesuit. 2. Having the character ascribed to the Jesuits; deceitful, dissembling; practising equivocation, prevarication or mental reservation of truth. Often used in sense of "hair-splitting", keenly analytical. (OED) I have a horror of falsehood [...] That is perhaps just where my protestantism lurks. (Andre Gide, Journals, 21 December 1923) On the eighteenth of October 1932, Samuel Beckett wrote to Thomas McGreevy: I don't know why the Jesuitical poem that is an end in itself and justifies all the means should disgust me so much. But it does - again - more and more. I was trying to like Mallarme again the other day and couldn't, because it's Jesuitical poetry, even the Swan and the Herodiade. I suppose I'm a dirty low-church P[rotestant; sic] even in poetry, concerned with integrity in a surplice. The interest in this half-rueful, half-wry avowal is less Beckett's repudiation of the cool and polished rhymes of the French symboliste than in his reiterated and slightly over-emphatic choice of the sectarian rhetoric of the Ireland of his time to indicate an aesthetic stance. In fact, this letter 223</page><page sequence="2">to McGreevy may be the germ of the various versions of the "dirty low church Protestant" phrase which would recur more than once, with this same uneasy insistence, in both Dream of Fair to middling Women and More Pricks Than Kicks, where they apostrophise the Beckett-figure Belacqua: "Distant lights on a dirty night, how he loved them, the dirty low-church Protestant!" (Dream, 227; mptk, 78); also in Dream, the Mandarin accuses Belacqua of being "a penny maneen of a low-down low church Protestant high-brow" (100); and in More Pricks Than Kicks, on the occasion of a joke's being made about the shooting of a parson, the narrator remarks of his character "It was a mercy that Belacqua was a dirty low-down Low Church Protestant high-brow and be able to laugh at this sottish jest" (184). The sardonic flowering forth of this phrase from an apparently throwaway - if engagingly mordant - self-description in a letter written during Beckett's brief and unhappy flirtation with academia at Trinity College Dublin, is a first flickering of the secularised Protestant, or post-Protestant, poetics Beckett would espouse in the stripped, bleakly-lit brand of negative capability which forms his mature writing. The evident edgy enjoyment of the much-hyphenated phrases and much qualified nouns which constitute Beckett's (and Belacqua's) self designations as Protestant speaks volumes about the marginality and what Stephen Gwynn famously called the "spiritual hyphenation" of the residual Church of Ireland population in the newly independent and increasingly theocratic Irish Free State in which this letter was written. Beckett, for his part, though a self-designated disbeliever in what he called in another letter to McGreevy the 'fable convenue" of history,2 is a less hermetic artist than he is typically painted. His writing derives much of its initial impetus, its paradoxically weak strength, from his sharply-felt marginality as an Irish Protestant in a Catholic theocracy and his early contemptuous opposition to its politics of synthetic history and cohesive tradition. Beckett's is an imagination never strongly rooted in Ireland. His early prose, poems and criticism strain up and away, via foreign words and forms, testament to an imagination striving to wean itself from its origin, a faculty striving for detachment though never perhaps achieving it to its own punctilious satisfaction. The self-labelling as Protestant which occurs as both symptom of malaise and aesthetic credo in the McGreevy letters is allied to the postures which make much of Beckett's writing before Watt a difficult and anticlimactic read, when approached from the achieved tone of the trilogy and the signature sparsity of the late prose. This early striving, cluttered allusiveness, which is certainly helplessly self-estranged as well as deliberately modernist-esoteric, its interruption by splenetic gestures of 224</page><page sequence="3">apartness and opposition in relation to any form of collective experience, and its jeering incessant self-commentary: Fool! Do you hope to untangle the knot of God's pain? [...] Melancholy Christ that was a soft one! Oh yes I think that was perhaps just a very little inclined to be rather too self-conscious. (Putnam, 476) are, once refined by distance and the discipline of a grafted tongue, the germs of the distinctive mature Beckett poetic vocabulary. It is this Irish Protestant sense of the marginal and excluded, the spiritually-hyphenated, the less-than-complete assent to an identity, a coercive cultural heritage, a literary tradition perceived as unmediated pressure rather than incitement, which provides, so to speak, the bedrock for Beckett's henceforth increasingly puritan probing of the quintessentially Protestant activities of examination of conscience, autobiography and iconoclasm. What of the other, repudiated, kind of art - that which Beckett designates the "Jesuitical", and to which he consigns the atheist Mallarme? Making a jest to McGreevy of his own palpable earnestness: "I'm not ashamed to stutter like this to you who am used to my wild way of failing to say what I imagine I want to say" - he complains of a kind of writing corresponding with arts of fraud and debauchery on the part of the writing-shed. The moan I have [...] more and more with mine is [...] that it is nearly all frigged up, in terram [....] and not of the spontaneous combustion that threatens its economy, fraudulent manoeuvres to make the cavity do what it can't do - the work of the abscess. I'm in mourning for the integrity of a pendu's emission of semen, what I find in Homer and Dante and Racine and sometimes Rimbaud, the integrity of the eyeball coming down before the brain knows of grit in the wind.3 Taking apart the agitated rhetoric of both these quoted passages, it seems evident that Beckett broadly aligns the low-church Protestant label he somewhat ambivalently embraces with a kind of writing which shuns "fraudulent manoeuvres" and "Jesuitical" casuistry. These he explicitly associates here with an art which he metaphorises sexually, as so often the way in these frequently half-frantic epistolary outpourings to McGreevy, as "frigged up," shammed or counterfeited for effect - a case of the end (the poem) justifying the falsifying, even masturbatory, means used to 225</page><page sequence="4">produce the requisite sexual release. Non-casuistic, "dirty low-church Protestant" art, on the other hand, is also described in somewhat studiedly schoolboy sexual terms, but as necessary, spontaneous, almost Orphic, partaking instead of the instinctive biological exigency of involuntary bodily emissions and reflexes, the ejaculation of the hanged man which will recur two decades later in Waiting for Godot and the reflexive "integrity" of the blinking eye, which reappears in many of the late prose texts. He is anxious about poetry he has written which "although it may be reasonably felicitous in its choice of terms", seem to him willed (his word is construit) and not what he calls, lapsing again into French, facultatif necessitous, unforced. Going on to speak of poems he feels are successful in his terms (notably "Alba" and "Moly", which certainly are the most fully-realised and mature of his poems in English of this time), his incipient low-church Protestant aesthetic, or ethic, is restated even more categorically: I cannot explain to myself very well what they have that distinguishes them from the others, but it is something arborescent or of the sky, not weather, not clouds on wheels; written above an abscess and not out of a cavity, a statement and not a description of heat in the spirit to compensate for pus in the spirit. The very landscape of the poem has to have its own independent anti anthropomorphic actuality and not simply exist to be passed through by the lyric self s pathetic fallacy. Nor can it be mere "clouds on wheels" - painted scenery flats for a play - a scenario a much older Beckett would eviscerate pitilessly in his drama, describing in a letter to the director Alan Schneider his vision of what the Happy Days set should look like: "a pathetic unsuccessful realism, the kind of tawdriness you get in 3rd rate musical or pantomime, that quality of pompier, laughably earnest bad imitation."4 Even amidst the baroque montage of his early writing, an instinctive puritan distrust of artifice, even of art itself, is already evident in the twenty-six year old Beckett, in a way which looks far ahead to the wire-sculpture economy of his late work. Beckett's cluster of early critical essays and reviews, written while he was still a young man yawing uneasily between Dublin, London, Kassel and Paris, in particular the essay "Recent Irish Poetry" suggests the demesure and exaggerated bitterness of a young prophet defiantly proclaiming "the new thing that has happened" with the air of one who knows he will be dishonoured in his own country. Written between May and July 1934 as a Bookman commission - and published pseudonymously, presumably as his "A Case in a Thousand" appeared in the same issue - 226</page><page sequence="5">the piece shows Beckett as protestant in the pure sense of the term, railing with a sort of wild sarcasm against the "flight from self-awareness" which he sees as uniting the poets of the Celtic Revival and their successors, and "in the use of which even beyond the jewels of language they are at one".5 The terms of this argument are familiar to many and have recently been illuminatingly discussed by Patricia Coughlan as a rare example of an Irish modernist manifesto;6 however, the terms in which Beckett shapes his argument have a specific Protestant cast, which has been less frequently noticed. He complains of the short-sighted assumption among "our leading twilighters" that The first condition of any poem is an accredited theme, and that in self perception there is no theme, but at best sufficient vis a tergo to land the practitioner into the correct scenery, where the self is either most happily obliterated or else so improved and enlarged that it can be mistaken for part of the decor. Fleeing from the self-perception Beckett would urge, Irish poetry takes its choice from the "iridescence of themes" at the circumference, which are recited by him like a mocking litany of Twilight saints: "Oisin, Cuchulain, Maeve, Tir-nanog, the Tain Bo Cuailgne, Yoga, the Crone of Beare [sic] - segment after segment of cut-and-dried sanctity and loveliness." This is of course a sneer at Yeats's "Coole and Ballylee, 1931", but the piece nonetheless takes at times a distinctly Yeatsian stance in its excoriation of the majority of Irish poetry since the Revival. There is more than a hint of the scornful huckster imagery of a poem like "September 1913" in Beckett's choice of barb for the poets he dubs "the antiquarians, delivering with the altitudinous complacency of the Victorian Gael the Ossianic goods" and in his particular singling out of Austin Clarke, who would also feature to his detriment four years later in Murphy, as a grocerish poet who commands the "fully licensed stock-in-trade from Aisling to Red Branch Bundling". (In a not dissimilar tone, some twenty years later in the early months of 1958, Beckett, infuriated at the Lord Chamberlain's ordering cuts in Endgame, before it could open in London, refused "to play along any further with these licensing grocers" [Knowlson, 450]). Beckett's puritan insistence on the self as sole theme for art is repelled by a state of affairs which, while not constituting actual censorship of non Celtic writing, nonetheless represented an implacable consensus in which the acceptable themes were given variously resourceful treatments, and in which the felicity - a word which Beckett invariably uses with a certain contempt - or correctness of a work's execution constituted the conspicuous 227</page><page sequence="6">focus of attention for both audience and artist. It is a very Protestant insistence on the right to private judgement and conscience - and on the foregrounding of that conscience as its own subject in art - which motivates Beckett's polemic here. It is of writers such as Beckett that Denis Donoghue is thinking when he writes that "Irish writers sense a rift between experience and meaning, but in reverse: the meaning is premature, already inscribed by a mythology they have no choice to inherit, and the experience is too narrow to be entirely natural and representative" (131). Beckett's abhorrence of the "Sinn Fein" ethos of the Irish collective, his self-confessed "chronic inability to understand [...] a phrase like 'the Irish people'",7 his anxiety at the foisting of an unwanted tradition upon him - an anxiety fed by the arm's length relationship between the residual Protestant minority and the Irish Free State - find their issue in the willed solitude and solipsism of his mature work. Like Shaw, who was symbolically liberated from a similar kind of genteel Irish Protestant youth by the burning of his birth certificate during the shelling of Dublin's government offices, Beckett's escape from the constraints of family, class and nation, gave him the chance both to create himself virtually ex nihilo and to evolve a writing of extreme introversion and puritan self-scrutiny. The real failing of recent Irish poetry, then, where Beckett is concerned, is its subscription to the "Celtic drill of extraversion" - its forsaking of a poetics of self-interrogation for an "extrovert" idealised relationship between "practitioner" and anthropomorphised landscape, the sentimentalised myths of sanctity and loveliness, and the "embroidery" he so excoriates in Yeats. The opposition is not, as one might expect, a mere opposition between Celtic myth and a filthy modern tide for which Beckett acts as hot-headed young spokesman. Looking carefully at his language in this, as in others among his early pieces, Beckett is already - as well as protesting against current poetic trends - advocating a distinctively Protestant poetics, pushing for a poetry of self-perception, "pure interrogation, rhetorical question less the rhetoric" (Disjecta, 91-99) and endorsing - in the first line of his appreciative review of Thomas McGreevy's Poems, written at the same period as his "Recent Irish Poetry" piece, a view that "[a]ll poetry, as discriminated from the various paradigms of prosody, is prayer" (Disjecta, 68-69). Yet again, religious concerns are pressed into acting as aesthetic criteria - what he calls in "Recent Irish Poetry" "a principle of individuation": For prayer may be "good" in Dante's sense on any note between and inclusive of the publican's whinge and the pharisee's tantara. When the changes are made we have the great publican poems (Vita Nuova, Astrophel and Stella, On the Death of Laura, etc.) And the great pharisee poems (Goethe's Prometheus, Carducci's 228</page><page sequence="7">Satan, and the best of our domestic low-church imprecations), to say nothing of their accommodation in a single period such as Milton contrived at the opening of Paradise Lost. (Disjecta, 68) Luke's parable of the pharisee and the publican, one publicly proclaiming his piety, the other murmuring his penitence, act here as the extremes of all poetry, the distinction made apparently more on tone than on the theology of the individual works; McGreevy is situated, as he is in "Recent Irish Poetry", somewhere between the two, user of an "adult mode of prayer" which is "syntonic" to his imagination (the term literally means "in harmony with one's environment"), a mode which Beckett defines as "the unfailing salute to his significant from which the fire is struck and the poem kindled" (Disjecta, 68). This, as well as being one of Beckett's spectral half-allusions - on this occasion to Timon of Athens - goes some way to elucidate (if not reductively explain) the apparent paradox of the self-avowedly atheistic Beckett having frequent critical recourse to religious models as "principle[s] of individuation", as poetics. This is both Beckett writing a perhaps unexpectedly moving and sensitive appreciation of the devout Catholic McGreevy's rapt lyricism, so dissimilar to both his own early esoteric montage and his later bleached nakedness of expression; and the elaboration of a poetics in which writing is prayer struck and kindled from a significant godhead or the poet's idea of such. In this respect, a remark by Ted Hughes in his Afterword to A Choice of Shakespeare's Verse is pertinent. Hughes writes: Poetic imagination is determined finally by the state of negotiation - in a person or in a people - between man and his idea of the creator. This is natural enough, and everything else is naturally enough subordinate to it. How things are between man and his idea of the Divinity determines everything in his life, the quality and connectedness of every feeling and thought, and the meaning of every action. (Hughes, 184-85) This may not be true of all, but it holds true for Beckett, the sheer weight of Christianity in all its rebuking aspects, its simultaneous calls to self denial and self-examination overriding his protestations to Charles Juliet and Tom Driver that Christianity for him was merely a familiar mythology and that religion had for him "no more depth than an old school tie".8 It may be difficult to determine exactly to what significant, what absent Godot or Deus absconditus Beckett's salute is made and his writing kindled, but that his idiom evolved from his own inherited spiritual 229</page><page sequence="8">divisions and obsessions is clear. Certainly closer in spirit to the publican's whinge than the pharisee's tantara, Beckett's writing eschews the jesuitical for the bleakly and strangely impersonal confessional, unprotected by any sleight of persona. His writings are above all misereres or ejaculations - the latter a word Beckett liked for its combination of the physical and the spiritual - of pure necessity, what Krapp calls a "yelp to Providence". In his The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Max Weber writes of the awful uncertainty and loneliness of a religion which, having done away with person-to-person confession, found it had also abolished "the means to a periodical discharge of the emotional sense of sin" (Weber, 106). This is one of the fundamentals behind the deadly repetitions of Beckett's writing, its compulsive tendency to scour and re-scour the same unpromising literary territory. As Hugh Kenner expresses it: "Let him by his previous operations have thoroughly salted some trampled patch of ground, and it is there that in time of frost he will plant his next seed" (Kenner, 25). Bereft of the occasion to "confess" to another, an instance of utterance which it would be presumptuous to dub a self confesses under the goad of a relentless imperative in classic Protestant fashion, but can never be sure of being shriven, and is thus doomed to seemingly endless repetitions of the same non-narrative in ever-decreasing hope of some eventual expiation. It is this "issueless Protestant confrontation with conscience" which forms the core of the unignorable impetus in Beckett's writing to go on, to "blacken a few more pages",9 to fulfil the prescription of the Three Dialogues' preference to an art of the feasible the "expression that there is nothing to express, nothing with which to express, nothing from which to express, no power to express, no desire to express, together with the obligation to express" (Disjecta, 139). Or, as Molloy has it: "Not to want to say, not to know what you want to say, not to be able to say what you think you want to say, and never to stop saying, or hardly ever, that is the thing to keep in mind, even in the heat of composition" (27). This is the DNA pattern, so to speak, of Beckett's imagination - a fiat with regard to which disobedience is unthinkable - rather than any fundamentally self-delighting inventiveness. His writing responds, it seems, like the voice of The Unnamable who is "obliged to speak", to a series of weakly messianic obligations: go on; imagine; remember; repeat: Imagination dead imagine. Imagine a place, that again. Never ask another question. 230</page><page sequence="9">Imagine a place, then someone in it, that again. Crawl out of the frowsy death bed and drag it to a place to die in. (Faux Departs, 271) The timeless imperative, wthout indicative verb or personal pronoun except the implied "you"; feeds an extraordinary sense in late Beckett of each word being wrested by a weak but unthwarted will from a surrounding silence, a sense intensified by the singular appearance of the late prose to the eye of the reader - its Giacommetti starkness and sparseness in large font against a wide margin of white paper, seen perhaps at its most striking in the characteristic look of Les Editions de Minuit. It is striking how often the cattle-goading imperatives obeyed in Beckett's writing coincide with the way in which Beckett himself habitually spoke and wrote about the process of writing. To Charles Juliet, for example, he remarked, "Writing has led me to silence [...] Still, I have to continue. I am facing a cliff, yet I have to move forward. Impossible, isn't it? Still one can move forward. Advance a few miserable millimetres" (Juliet 1988, 17). His recently published correspondence with Alan Schneider, perhaps because Schneider was frequently eager for new Beckett works to direct, is punctuated with an even more restless, even self-accusatory, sense of the necessity, the imperative of writing on. There are frequent references to "stumbling on", "slogging on", "struggling with impossible prose", amidst the "wastes and wilds of self-translation", to his work being "like writing on a pinhead with fading sight and shaking hands", which read eerily as though they have leached into the letters as fallout from his work.10 The letters are often chilling in their casual depiction of the sheer personal cost of Beckett's writing, their amplification of the intuition the reader has of the toil with which each word of, say, the spare late prose has been ground out against an engulfing silence. There is no sprezzatura here, none of the self-delighting ease and facility Beckett found so suspicious in early Yeats; the voice is extorted, as are the voices of the tortured beings of How It Is, commands there can be no gainsaying: "Yes, those imperatives were quite explicit and even detailed until, having set me in motion at last, they began to falter, then went silent, leaving me there like a fool who neither knows where he is going or why he is going there" (Molloy, 79-80). Whether by the blow of a can-opener, a interrogating light, or a voice in the dark which commands a supine figure to imagine, Beckett's almost Augustinian monologues tighten around the speaking instance: You may say that it is all in my head and indeed sometimes it seems to me I am in a head and that these eight, no, six, planes that enclose me are of solid bone... 231</page><page sequence="10">Fortunately it is not so much an affair of eyelids, but as it were the soul that must be veiled, that soul denied in vain, vigilant, anxious, turning in its cage as in a lantern, in the night without haven or craft. (Malone Dies, 203) The extent to which a poet can find his voice through and in his native dialect of course varies greatly, though Beckett is perhaps particularly distinguished by the extent to which his writing leans out beyond the plumb of both his native English and his adopted French. It is precisely this two way pull, from the impersonally eloquent metres of a French somewhere between argot and Racine, to a more weighted and entrammelled Hiberno English, that lies behind Beckett's distinctive voice, a voice that inclines to plainness, to puritanism, but yields to the drift and suggestion of a rhythm, that begins to declare but evolves towards introspection. Beckett's infinitely, spectrally suggestive nakedness of style is also bedded, as has frequently been observed, in the sonorous plainness of the King James Bible, particularly the grimmer Psalms which muse on the brevity of human existence in terms not dissimilar to Waiting for Godot - and the faded grandeur of the somewhat lugubrious hymns sung in Tullow Church of Ireland - Abide with me, Now the day is over and the like, ironically appropriate to the post-independence evening of this residual community. On this subject, Seamus Heaney has written of the way in which his Northern Catholic childhood "bedd[ed] the ear with a kind of linguistic hardcore that could be built on some day", consisting of the "gorgeous and inane phraseology of the catechism; or [...] the litany of the Blessed Virgin that was part of the enforced poetry in our household" (Heany 1980, 45). Heaney's mature writing is obedient to this "enforced poetry", swimming with the current of its originary music, while Beckett's, on the other hand, instead of surrendering to his donne, hurls itself against it with an intent which, when not actually smashing apart or eviscerating, is stripping down, impoverishing, baring. As early as his much-quoted letter to Axel Kaun, written in 1937, his tone is militantly heretical towards the word which he images as sacred icon. Much of the letter partakes of a typically early-modernist demolition drive towards a language contemptuously perceived as "official" (a term which deepens in sarcasm when one remembers the contemporary attempts at the revival of Irish as "official" language of Ireland), and as ostentatiously old-fashioned, a capitalised Grammar and Style almost personified as 19th century caricatures, "irrelevant as a Victorian bathing suit or the imperturbability of a true gentleman" {Disjecta, 171). The solution to such stultifying anachronism lies in its "efficient misuse", to "bore one hole after 232</page><page sequence="11">another in it" on the way to dismantling it for good and all. However, as the tone of the letter heightens, so does a creeping tendency to view the word as religious object, at first in a series of rhetorical questions: "Is there something paralysingly holy in the vicious nature of the word [...]? Is there any reason why that terrible materiality of the word surface should not be capable of being dissolved?" But the most significant sentence of the letter is its final one: "Only from time to time I have the consolation, as now, of sinning willy-nilly against a foreign language, as I should love to do with full knowledge and intent against my own - and as I shall do - Deo juvante." Here Beckett, writing in distancing German, announces his literary ambitions as a kind of literary iconoclasm, a deliberate "sinning" against the sacredness of language - he draws on the Christian vocabulary of mortal sin, as a sin which requires full knowledge and intent. As matters stand, he is necessarily making accidental solecisms in a foreign language, accidentally sinning against German, so to speak, and meditating pleasurably on the possibility of deliberately mounting a similar attack on his native language. "Official English" would be, of course the language to be profaned for the Protestant Beckett, in a way that would not be conceivable for his Catholic contemporaries, even had they the same icon smashing desires, for the simple reason that for pre-Vatican II Catholics, the linguistic holy of holies would have indisputably been Latin, a language which is always satisfactorily already dead to Beckett's ear. French, then, becomes a weapon with which to smash the iconic status of his native English. Neither is the vocabulary of sin a mere young man's whim; in the early 1960s Beckett referred to a phrase in Textes pour rien as "a very hazardous tournure which no Frenchman would commit" (Cohn, 613). The iconoclasm of Beckett's imagination is evident even in the fulsome, well-read verbosity of his early writing, in its immature squaring up to Joyce's legacy, its gleeful dismantling of cliche, and its excitable tilting at narrative norms, its wilful untidiness, its deliberately unsuccessful realism. With hindsight, however, it is difficult to escape the impression that the visible Sturm und Drang of this frequently exultant breaking of the rules retains too much of the apprentice, the schoolboy thumbing his nose at authority, as his early poems evoke a sense of facile "frigged-up" despairs. It is only in the stripped-down, unsublime (negatively sublime?) writing of the post-war years that the elements of split and secularised Protestantism, to date more inherent in his fiercely polemic criticism than in his writing, come to the fore. It has been remarked that Beckett's stages, stripped of unnecessary artifice or ornament, resemble low-church altars, their lack of props which might indicate a mode of action or behaviour 233</page><page sequence="12">indicative of a puritan scepticism about images and image-making (Kiberd, 458). Yet his postwar prose is a still more striking statement of the necessity for the individual soul to go naked before the godhead, casting off what little of its Yeatsian "embroideries" remain to it, in a literalisation of the gnomic addendum to Watt: "No symbols where none intended." If Beckett's drama is saturated with a deep reservation about play-acting, or suspicion of the ethics of impersonation, which his plays carry, paradoxically, into the very heart of the theatre - so that in the performance of a Beckett play a very real revenge is being visited upon its actors for the crime of being actors in the first place - then his prose reveals even more nakedly its unconcealed aggressive intent towards the whole notion of mimesis. Watt, with its indebtedness to the thin, exhausted and exhaustive English of the "Ithaca" episode of Ulysses, makes a quiet but devastating mockery of any possible "receivedness" of meaning in the passages which treat of the visit of the Galls. Watt himself operates a pedantic, endlessly elaborated iconoclasm, rehearsing the iconic incident in his head until it has "developed a purely plastic content and gradually lost, in the nice presence of its light, its sound, its impacts and its rhythm, all meaning, even the most literal". Its relegation to an event of "great formal brilliance and indeterminable purport" enacts both a point-blank renegade refusal in miniature of the premature and consensual nature of meaning for the post Revival Irish writer and, more significantly in terms of Beckett's own writing, ushers in the era of Beckett's mature French apostasy from what he calls in his letter to Axel Kaun the "sacred game" of literature (Disjecta, 173). A TLS review of Lessness from 1970 is not untypical of critical disappointment with the residual forms of late Beckett and exhibits a marked nostalgia for the novel: Since Comment c'est and Play, nothing substantial has come from Samuel Beckett, nothing except dramaticules and fragments. He has seemed intent not only on eliminating almost everything from his images, as though in search of an immaculate of nothing, but also on abandoning every area in which his fertile talents threatened to flourish. (TLS, 1970) Beckett's mature fiction often reads like an exercise in doing without, in the wartime rationing and austerity he willingly faced, rather than stay in neutral Ireland; it is the reverse of opulent. One of its key terms is "aporia", from the Greek a- and poros, the prefix indicating negation attached to a word which means a pathway, passage, or more specifically, in the neuter 234</page><page sequence="13">plural, provisions for a journey. Thus, much of Beckett's mature prose, with its weakly dogged emphasis on the necessity of stumbling forward against the cliff-face, of wresting one more impossible word out of the engulfing silence, hinges on aporia in the sense of "being without provisions for a journey". A logical extension of the dilemma of the young Irish Protestant writer, with no credit lodged in the bank of national experience of a new and philistine regime, this literary bankruptcy or insolvency plots its impossible tapering trajectory by cultivating a language of ideally impoverished meanings and references. The end result of this is of course the almost hermetic language of a text like Worstward Ho, which takes to its ultimate conclusion the desire to preserve oneself from induction into a community of forcibly shared meanings, and, instead, to keep words as the hermetic playthings of an immaculate solipsism. The flickers of fear and horror in Worstward Ho are essentially the same as those expressed decades before in Endgame: "We're not beginning to mean something?" - a fear of infection with sense, of accumulation into coherence, of suppressed vestiges of verbal richness re-emerging. We are left, in the late works, above all in texts like Lessness and Ping, with what has been called a kind of "frozen verbal sculpture" (Wicker, 71), patterns of fundamental sounds in which words have simply become sparse, penurious objects in a vacuum, the mere bare bones of communication. While the early fiction tells its sardonically self-conscious stories, the middle fiction can only muse upon its own dubious genesis, and the late prose does not even purport to tell a story, but merely "rattles its own language" (Federman, 330), only at long intervals offering even a reductio ad absurdum of narrative, as for instance in Worstward Ho's minimal progression from "somehow on" to "nohow on". Puritan scepticism about imagery has ground all down to a nonetheless sumptuous minimalism, ritually purged the writing of everything but its own relentless concreteness.
