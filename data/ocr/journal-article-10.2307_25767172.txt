It remains challenging, however, to distinguish gendered job status (affected by family composition and other personal characteristics) from sex-linked biological differences influencing physiological response to workplace physical hazards. Methods We examined the effects of hourly (blue collar) status on incident hypertension among men and women, using health claims data for 14 618 white- and blue-collar aluminium manufacturing employees in eight US states. To explore gender differences in job status, we developed sex-stratified propensity score models identifying key socioeconomic predictors of hourly status for men and women. To examine the effects of hourly employment on hypertension risk, after adjusting for gender differences in job status, we applied time weighted logistic regression models, stratified by propensity score, with additional adjustment for socioeconomic confounders. Results Family structure (partnership, parity) influenced job status for both sexes; single mothers were more likely to hold hourly jobs (OR 2.02; 95% Cl 1.37 to 2.97) and partnered men with children less likely (OR 0.68; 95% Cl 0.56 to 0.83). Education, age at hire and race influenced job status for both sexes. The effect of hourly status on hypertension was significant only among women predicted to be hourly (OR 1.78; 95% Cl 1.34 to 2.35). Conclusions Our results indicate significant risks of hypertension associated with hourly status for women, possibly exacerbated by sociodemographic factors predicting hourly status (eg, single parenthood, low education). Greater attention to gender differences in job status, and finer exploration of sex-linked biological differences influencing responsivity to workplace exposures, is warranted. INTRODUCTION Studies have reported greater cardiovascular health risks associated with blue-collar manufacturing work for women than for men.1-3 It remains unknown, however, whether this risk is attribut able to gender differences in the types of jobs normally assigned to men and women (eg, owing to cultural expectations, family responsibilities) or to sex-linked biological differences in response to physical hazards. This distinction between sex (ie, biological differences by chromosomal complement, including reproductive organs and hormonal com position) and gender (ie, socially-derived roles and behaviours)4 is crucial for accurately disaggregating What this paper adds Multiple studies have reported elevated health risks for women performing blue-collar manufacturing work; however, it remains unknown what proportion of these elevated risks is due to differences between men and women in job status, or to differences in susceptibility to workplace exposures. Application of a propensity score method enabled some distinction to be made between gendered job status and biological biological differences in health response to manufacturing work. After adjustment for sociodemographic confounding, we found that hourly (blue-collar) status predicted hypertension onset among women, particulariy among those more likely to be hourly. Our results suggest that women may have stronger risks associated with blue-collar work. Our results suggest that further exploration of work-related exposures and susceptibilities, which may differ between men and women, is warranted and that there may be some heightened susceptibility among lower-SES workers, predicted to be hourly. their related health risks and designing effective interventions.5-7 Gender differences in job status are well docu mented.8 Men and women differ, on average, in job related chemical exposures,9 ergonomic demands10 and psychosocial stressors.11 Family roles influence employment decisions and women's greater average domestic task burden12 may affect fatigue, non-occupational stress,13 14 response to workplace stressors, and return to work following illness or injury.15-17 Further, the same workplace or job may be experienced differently by women and men; differences in anthropomorphic measurements and work equipment designed for male bodies can increase women's task burden,18-20 and women are more likely to experience harassment, discrimina tion21 22 or low job control.11 23 Gender and sex are tightly intertwined and therefore difficult to distinguish in epidemiological data. Several frame works have been developed towards disentangling these effects,24 and nascent methods from gender analysis allow for some (albeit imperfect) differen tiation of social and biological risks.7 Women comprise a very small proportion of blue collar workers but are overly represented in low grade jobs25 26 and earn less than men doing the 16 Occup Environ Med 2011;68:16-23. doi: 10.1136/oem.2009.049908</page><page sequence="2">Original article same job. This gendered stratification of work is important because low job grade has been linked to heart disease,27 hypertension28 and injury.29 30 Most research on the health effects of job status31 has focused on predominantly male, white-collar populations,32 and it remains unclear whether job status operates similarly among women or blue-collar workers. Finally, lower-grade and manufacturing work is associated with a wide range of chemical, physical and psychosocial stressors, thus the specific aspects of low-grade work which contribute to adverse health events will vary by age, gender and setting 33 We compared the effects of hourly (blue-collar) status on hypertension using health claims data for 14618 male and female white- and blue-collar aluminium manufacturing employees across eight US states. In a prior analysis, we observed elevated hypertension risks with hourly status, after adjustment for socioeconomic status (SES),34 and observed stronger effects among women than men. Elevated risks were also observed with low job grade, more prevalent among hourly women than men. Here, we further examine differences in work-related risk between men and women by using propensity scores to better adjust for gendered job status in manufacturing work. Notably, however, the method does not distinguish sex related differences in response to workplace hazards from gender-related differences operating after hire (eg, workplace harassment or discrimination). Nor does this approach inher ently adjust for gender differences in the types of job performed within blue- and white-collar groups. To examine gender influences in job status, we developed sex stratified propensity score models. In these models, job status (hourly vs salaried) is predicted as a function of pre-hire socio demographic characteristics and personal life factors (eg, marital status, parity), which may differentially influence men's and women's employment decisions and job status. We identified men and women more likely to hold hourly (blue-collar) versus salaried (white-collar) jobs. Propensity-stratified time-weighted logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were then used to examine sex-specific risks associated with hourly status, with further multivariate adjustment for SES and other risk factors. METHODS Study population We examined the health and employment records for all male and female hourly (mainly production) and salaried (production supervisors and administrative) personnel in 11 US Alcoa aluminium manufacturing plants who were actively employed full-time as of 1 January 2000. Eligibility was restricted to 14 618 workers with at least one medical insurance claim during the 7-year period from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2002, retaining 98% of employees. Gender or job status differences in the likelihood of using their own or a partner's health insurance could bias results, but only minimally given that 98% of our cohort showed some medical claim in our dataset. Incident cases of hypertension in medical claims data We examined hypertension onset as a risk factor for stroke and ischaemic heart disease (IHD)35 and a broad indicator of systemic illness. To identify incident hypertension, we excluded subjects with IHD-related claims prior to the first hypertension diagnosis, and required 2 years without any hypertension or heart disease claim; follow-up thus begins on the later of 1 January 1998 or 2 years after hire date. Follow-up ends on the earliest of 31 December 2002, date of job termination or employee's 65th birthday (when Medicare coverage begins), for up to 5 years. Incident cases were defined by two or more diagnoses following 2 disease-free years, previously validated by medical record review.36 Date of onset was defined as date of initial diagnosis in a face-to-face medical encounter of hypertensive disease classified as ICD-9 codes 401 through 405. Eighty one potential cases with new-onset IHD (ICD-9 codes 410 through 414) prior to the first observed hypertension diagnosis during follow-up were also excluded. As the claims file contains claims for 98% of employees, and because of the high quality coverage offered, consistent across all job grades, we may assume that most employee families use this as their primary coverage, and that few employees with poor adherence in hypertension care would be missed by the 2-year wash-out. Our use of medical claims data for this cohort is detailed elsewhere.37 Because family composition may differently affect men's and women's employment decisions and job status, we also searched medical claims files for evidence of whether each employee had a partner or dependent children. Partners were identified by any claim coded 'spouse' linked to the employee's ID. Dependent children were identified by any claim (coded 'dependent') with a birthdate indicating age less than 18 years. Other data sources Demographic characteristics (sex, date of birth, race/ethnicity, education) and employment characteristics (hourly/salaried status, job grade, dates of hire and job termination, plant loca tion) were obtained from human resource files (PeopleSoft). As these characteristics changed little over follow-up, we used the characteristics of the job held on 1 January 2000, the mid-point of follow-up. Age on this date was centred and transformed to reduce collinearity between higher order terms (age2, age3), adjusting for non-linear age effects. Smoking behaviours, height and weight were identified from on-site health examination records for 2001?2002. Income data were available from Social Security electronic wage reporting forms (W-2 records), but only for 2002-2004. W-2 data exclude income from non-company sources but are highly accurate, as these records are reported to the government for tax purposes. Mean annual income for each employee was calculated excluding income-years below US$20000 (an imperfect indi cator of part-time status for that year(s)), and divided into tertiles. Notably, some higher-wage part-time employees may be retained, possibly differentially retaining women (eg, secre taries). Income for persons leaving full-time work before 2002 is classified as unknown. W-2 income may misrepresent total family income, especially for women, although sex-stratified propensity and hypertension models should minimise this bias. Job grade, with two separate 2?30 scales for hourly and salaried staff, is uniformly used by all company locations to discriminate jobs by experience, skill level, seniority and prestige (ie, hourly jobs above 23 typically require technical skill, for example electrician or maintenance mechanic). Tenure (years on the job) was calculated for 1 January 2000, the centre of follow up, using hire date from human resource files. Notably, tenure may also indicate secular changes and generational attitudes towards gendered work roles, as there are very few long-tenure hourly women. Analytical approach In this longitudinal study, we modelled cumulative incidence of hypertension as a function of hourly status and employment duration, adjusting for sociodemographic factors. We aimed to Occup Environ Med 2011;68:16-23. doi:10.1136/oem.2009.049908 17</page><page sequence="3">Original article adjust for confounding by pre-hire characteristics, particularly factors differently influencing job status by gender, to better compare the health risks of hourly work for women and men. To this end, we used a two-stage analytical approach wherein we first modelled the sex-specific likelihood of holding an hourly job, based on pre-hire characteristics, producing the subject specific probability (propensity score). We then stratified by propensity (more or less than 0.50), and fit multivariable regression models to separately estimate the probability of hypertension onset for men and for women. Propensity score analyses We created separate models to predict men's and women's individual propensity scores; the propensity score is an individ ual's probability of being exposed (here, hourly) given observed pre-exposure (here, pre-hire) characteristics.38 39 To reduce confounding by socioeconomic factors, we examine hyperten sion risks within propensity strata, among workers with similar likelihoods of hourly status, given pre-existing characteristics. Propensity scores were calculated using logistic regression, esti mating each employee's propensity score as a function of part nership, parity, age, education, height and race/ethnicity. Job grade, income, smoking and body mass index (BMI) were not included in propensity models, as these may be consequences, rather than antecedents, of job status (further examined in sensitivity analyses). Propensity model fits were assessed by the c statistic,40 which assesses the model's ability to correctly discriminate binary outcomes. Using this method, we identified subjects more likely to hold hourly or salaried jobs, improving our socioeconomic adjustment beyond that afforded by multivariable analysis. Due to possible residual confounding within the wide propensity bands, we retained all potential confounders in multivariable models for hypertension. Multivariable models for hypertension To estimate the effects of hourly status on hypertension, we fit time-weighted logistic regression to model cumulative inci dence.41 We opted for this approach, rather than Cox models, because of the relatively short follow-up (maximum of 5.0 years: 7.0 years minus 2.0 year washout for incidence), little variation in follow-up across subjects (70% contributed 5.0 years), and the time-invariant primary exposure of interest (hourly vs salary status). Cumulative incidence was calculated as the proportion of newly diagnosed cases during follow-up. We report adjusted ORs, in logistic models stratified by propensity scores. We retained all observations with complete data on the continuous variables of interest in both propensity and multivariate models. Sensitivity analyses We examined the sensitivity of results to perturbations in our analytical methods. Internal cross-validation was performed by dropping observations sequentially, and comparing model fits to identify influential observations. We examined alternative case criteria, using number of visits as a surrogate for illness severity; case criteria were varied from one to five hypertension-related visits. We validated propensity and hypertension models for robust ness to adjustment for plant, and exclusion of two plants with only salaried positions. We also evaluated the impact of specific confounders, including income, measured after onset in some cases, and percentage of hourly women at each plant. In propen sity models, we tested the effect of including BMI and smoking, which might be both predictors and consequences of job status. Due to significant missing data for smoking, education and BMI7 each was examined as a binary variable with an 'unknown' category allowing us to retain those individuals in our analyses. For BMI, the only continuous variable among these, a sensitivity analysis was performed retaining only those individuals with known BMI. Finally, Cox proportional hazard models were developed to corroborate the significant effect of hourly status, stratified by sex and predicted job status. Cox models provide rigorous adjustment for confounding by age, by using age as the time metric in the hazard function. To verify the underlying assumption of proportional hazards, we examined survival functions; although these functions did not confirm propor tional hazards, authors have shown that violation of the assumption does not render hazard ratios invalid for relatively large sample sizes.42 Statistical analyses were performed using SAS v 9.1. Propen sity and hypertension models were fit using Proc Logistic. Cox proportional hazard models were developed using Proc PHReg. All research involving data on human subjects was performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Yale School of Medicine. RESULTS We examined job status and hypertension onset among 14618 employees in 11 plants in eight US states (Indiana, Iowa, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas). Women comprised 8.4% (n=793) of hourly and 36% (n=1223) of salaried workers. Our cohort is largely male (86%), Caucasian (86%) and hourly (69%). On average, employees were 46.3 years old (SD 9.1 years) at the middle of follow-up and employed for 17.3 years (SD 11.3 years). Age did not differ significantly by sex or job status. Salaried women averaged 43.0 years of age (SD 8.8), while hourly women averaged 44.4 years of age (SD 8.9). Salaried men averaged 45.6 year of age (SD 8.4), while hourly men averaged 47.1 years of age (SD 9.2). Overall, 1580 cases of incident hypertension (10.7%) occurred during follow-up, with a higher incidence among hourly than salaried workers (11.9% vs 8.4%), and among men than women overall (11.2% vs 8.1%). Male and female hourly employees had comparable incidence (11.9%), compared to 5.6% among salaried females and 9.5% among salaried males. Cohort demographics are detailed in table 1. In simple sex-stratified logistic regression models, adjusted only for age (table 2), we found that hourly status, age, tenure, above-median BMI, low- or medium-tertile income, African American race and prior smoking predicted higher risk for men. Hispanic ethnicity and job grade were protective. Effects of hourly status, tenure, income, African-American race and prior smoking were stronger among women. Including all covariates in sex-stratified multivariable models (table 3), hourly status predicted hypertension only among women. In multivariable models across the full cohort (n=14618), hourly status increased hypertension risk (adj OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.20) (model not shown). Stratifying by sex, we found that hourly status more strongly increased risk among the 2016 women (adj OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.39 to 2.02) than among the 12 602 men (adj OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11) (models not shown); the interaction of sex and hourly/salaried status was highly significant (p&lt;0.0001). Importantly, however, this model does not account for broad differences between men and women in overall likelihood of hourly status or in those factors which differently affect their employment decisions and job status. 18 Occup Environ Med 2011;68:16-23. doi:10.1136/oem.2009.049908</page><page sequence="4">Original article Table 1 Cohort demographics by sex in 11 plants Male Female Hourly Salaried Hourly (n = 9280) (n = 3322) (n = 793) Mean (SD) Mean (SD) Mean (SD) Salaried (n = 1223) Mean (SD) Income (median income) Tenure (years on the job) BMI Job grade Education Race/ethnicity Smoking Hypertension Heart disease Less than high school More than high school Unknown Caucasian African-American Hispanic Other/unknown Current Prior Never Unknown 46.7 50685 49201 18.4 30.0 12.4 N 4133 1306 3841 7942 875 410 53 1623 1412 2021 4224 1101 392 (9.0) (11389) (11.8) (5.2)* (8.3) (%) (44.5) (14.1) (41.4) (85.6) (9.4) (4.4) (0.6) (17.5) (15.2) (21.8) (45.5) (11.9) (4.2) 45.6 95025 75883 16.7 29.2 14.8 N 405 751 2166 2979 166 107 70 209 287 610 2216 316 106 (8.4) (134791) (10.2) (5.0)* (5.7) (%) (12.2) (22.6) (65.2) (89.7) (5.0) (3.2) (2.1) (6.3) (8.6) (18.4) (66.7) (9.5) (3.2) 44.4 45707 45025 12.1 29.9 7.3 N 337 138 318 569 188 27 9 169 85 198 341 94 16 (8.9) (10385) (9.1) (6.0) (5.7) (%) (42.5) (17.4) (40.1) (71.8) (23.7) (3.4) (1.1) (21.3) (10.7) (25.0) (43.0) (11.9) (2.0) 43.0 67436 55134 13.5 26.5 11.0 N 104 185 934 1068 109 28 18 43 55 196 929 69 12 (8.8) (47581) (9.3) (5.7) (4.6) (%) (8.5) (15.1) (76.4) (87.3) (8.9) (2.3) (1.5) (3.5) (4.5) (16.0) (76.0) (5.6) (1.0) *BMI distribution is based on the 54% of all hourly and 41% of salaried personnel with non-missing data; missing BMI was not significantly associated with other covariates.

Propensity score models To better account for gender in job status, we fit sex-stratified logistic models estimating each individual7s probability of being hourly based on known pre-hire characteristics: family structure (partnership, parity), height, age at hire, sex, education and race/ ethnicity (table 4). High c statistics indicated good model fit, especially for women (c=0.88 vs 0.82) even after including height, which significantly predicted job status only among men. Male single parents were more likely to be hourly. Men with a partner and child were more likely to be salaried, as were taller men. Older age at hire, lower education and African-American race increased men's likelihood of hourly status. For women, single parenthood strongly increased the likelihood of hourly status, although partnership alone conferred no significant effect. Older, less educated and African-American women were more likely to be hourly. Hourly men's scores are right-skewed; most hourly men were highly likely to be hourly. Salaried men's scores indicated that about 30% were highly unlikely to be hourly, although about half had scores predicting hourly status (propensity (Pr)&gt;0.5). Hourly women's propensity scores were less skewed than hourly men's, although most were predicted to be hourly.

Job grade effects on hypertension While men in our cohort were more likely to be hourly both hourly and salaried women were more likely to hold a low-grade job. Hourly women's median job grade was 6 (mean 7.3, SD 5.7) versus 10 for hourly men (mean 12.4, SD 8.3). For salaried women, their median job grade was 10 (mean 10.9, SD 4.6) versus 15 for salaried men (mean 14.8, SD 5.7). Women's job grade distributions were left-skewed, with very few hourly or salaried women above grade 18. Although higher job grade generally reduced the risk of hypertension for women, those in the highest grades had very high relative risks. However, due to the small number of women in high job grades, imbalanced job grade distributions by sex, and apparent non-linear effects of job grade on hypertension, job grade was not explored further in this analysis. Sensitivity analyses Regression diagnostics did not indicate any influential observa tions in final logistic models, using one-at-a-time exclusion of observations. Varying the case definition, we consistently found elevated hypertension risks with hourly status only for women, which increased with more stringent case criteria. For the least stringent criteria (one hypertension-related visit, 15.9% inci dence), the OR was 1.97 (95% Cl 1.54 to 2.52) among women predicted to be hourly. For the most stringent criteria (five or more claims, 6.4% incidence), the OR among women predicted to be hourly was 2.70 (95% Cl 1.77 to 4.12). There was no association between hourly status and hypertension, using any case criteria among men in either propensity group. If greater case stringency indicates greater illness severity, these results suggest that hourly status among women is related not only to greater likelihood of onset but also to greater illness severity. We examined the robustness of results to exclusion of cova riates with problematic measurement (eg, income), finding no influence on risk estimates. Likewise, including BMI and smoking in the propensity models, rather than the disease models, did not alter propensity distributions or hypertension risks. Nor did excluding the two salaried-only plants in models adjusted for plant location or adjusting for percentage of female hourly workers by plant, affect the results. Finally, results were consistent between logistic and using Cox proportional hazards models, where hourly status consistently conferred elevated hazard ratios only among women predicted to be hourly (HR 1.426; p=0.006) (model not shown). DISCUSSION Our results indicate that job status is influenced by family characteristics for both women and men. Single parents, espe cially women, were more likely to be hourly; partnered men with children were more likely to be salaried, as were taller men. Older age at hire, lower education and African-American race increased the likelihood of hourly status for both women and men. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors predicting job status, hourly work increased hypertension risks solely among women predicted to be hourly, an effect which increased with more stringent case criteria. Our results suggest that manufacturing work may increase women's risks beyond socioeconomic confounding and gendered job status. Possible explanations include different physiological responses to workplace hazards (chemical, physical or psycho social) or gender differences in the manufacturing environment experience, as women remain a small minority of manufacturing workers. Further investigation of sex and gender differences in task burden, susceptibility, job status and social experiences at work, including gender discrimination or harassment, is warranted. Our main result of stronger adverse health effects of hourly (blue-collar) work among women corroborates other studies.1-3 To date, it has been unclear, however, whether these greater risks were attributable to sex-linked biological differences (eg, body size, hormonal composition), gender differences (eg, workplace discrimination) or some interplay thereof. We have distinguished some gender and sex effects, using sex-stratified Occup Environ Med 2011;68:16-23. doi:10.1136/oem.2009.049908 21</page><page sequence="7">Original article propensity models predicting job status. Residual confounding, however, remains possible, and many gendered factors beyond job status may influence differential responses to hourly work. For example, one may hypothesise that more 'masculine7 women (perhaps by physiological attributes, such as body size) may self-select into hourly jobs. We find some support for this hypothesis, as we observed slightly (but not significantly) greater height and BMI, on average, among hourly than salaried women. Our results raise important questions about how manufacturing work may differently affect men and women. Without measures of workplace physical and chemical expo sures, we can not explore differential sex-related responses to specific chemical exposures. Nor can we evaluate differential sex related patterns related to non-chemical hazards, such as ill fitting protective equipment, or to task burden. Equally plausible are gender-based hypotheses; women in manufacturing envi ronments may lack support or equal advancement opportunity, experience greater harassment or discrimination on the job, or have family demands which alter response to workplace expo sures via aggregate stress exposures or cumulative effects. Importantly, the heightened effects observed among women with sociodemographic characteristics predicting hourly status (eg, lower education) suggest an interaction between SES and job-related exposures, that is, increased susceptibility among women with lower SES. Limitations Epidemiological research using health claims data raises several challenges.37 Most of the structural deficiencies in the data used for this study, however, should drive effects towards the null. For example, claims may be missing for persons with multiple insurance plans, leading to outcome misclassification and lower observed incidence, which, if non-differential by work status, may alter relative risks. However, if, for example, salaried workers are more likely to have other insurance and thereby more missed diagnoses, then bias away from the null may result. Outcome misclassification may also differ by gender, if tradi tional families rely on the husband's income or insurance, resulting in more missed diagnoses among married women, producing bias away from the null. Such under-reporting should be very minimal, however, as 98% of employees show at least one medical claim during follow-up, and the company provides exhaustive medical coverage for families at all job grades. Among blue-collar workers, we expect a healthy-worker effect due to selective hiring of relatively healthy individuals.43 In studies restricted to active workers, such as ours, we also expect healthy worker survivor bias to weaken associations, as employees affected by chronic disease are more likely to termi nate employment, leaving a less-susceptible population still employed. Even in an analysis based on internal comparisons, the relative risks are likely biased downward 44 Income data were available only for 2002 through 2004, after disease onset in some cases, posing directionality problems. We also lack total household income, which may differentially predict men's and women's SES. Future follow-up of this cohort will enable us to observe the prospective effects of income on health. Finally, the 11 plants included here did not provide adequate variability for multi-level modelling, and our one plant-level covariate of interest (percentage of female blue-collar workers), varied relatively little by plant. Future analyses will include more plants, and will apply multi-level techniques to examine inter actions between individual- and plant-level covariates. Strengths These limitations do not detract from our central finding: hourly status increased hypertension risks solely among women predicted to be hourly after adjusting for pre-hire factors. Lower SES, predictive of hourly status, may indicate greater suscepti bility among female workers. Our dataset allowed examination of risk factors differentially influencing women's and men's job status and health. We were also uniquely able to compare data for blue- and white-collar workers in the same locations and with the same employer, whereby all workers are provided with identical health benefits and provider networks. These characteristics of the data allowed better distinction between health effects related to cumulative on-the-job exposures and those related to pre-existing factors which predict job status, for both men and women. CONCLUSIONS We found that female workers showed a greater likelihood of hypertension onset with hourly (blue-collar) status than did male workers, after adjustment for confounding using propen sity stratification and multivariable analysis. This effect was stronger among women with sociodemographic characteristics predictive of hourly status, suggesting greater susceptibility among lower-SES women. Propensity modelling revealed that job status was signifi cantly influenced by family characteristics for both women and men. Single parents, especially women, were more likely to be hourly; partnered men with children were more likely to be salaried. By allowing sociodemographic characteristics and family structure to differently predict employment for men and women, this application of propensity stratification improved our adjustment for confounding. As a result, the method allows some distinction between gendered factors influencing job status and sex-differing biological response to workplace hazards.
