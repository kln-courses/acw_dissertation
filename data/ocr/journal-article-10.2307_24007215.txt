<plain_text><page sequence="1">C. MISCELLANEA JUSTIN MARTYR ON MONOTHEISM AND HERESY by Dr. A. DAVIDS Sambeek Among the so-called Apologists of the second century Justin must be considered the most remarkable. Besides his two Apologies, instructive for his use of Greek philosophical and religious thinking, he also left an extensive, though incomplete Dialogue with the Jew Trypho, which contains all the arguments a Christian of the Early Church could use when vindicating the exclusiveness of his faith against the erroneous Jewish rehgion.1 All three works date probably from the years 150-160 A.D. Had Justin's lost works, mainly his Syntagma or Book against all the Heresies, been preserved, then we should also have the first Christian account of that third main theme of Early Christian apologetics. Since Justin composed his Syntagma before the First Apology—he refers to it in ch. 26— it is only to be expected that elements of it may be present in his preserved works. Justin was consistent on many topics, as can be verified by comparing the Apologies with the Dialogue, and it would be most surprising had he changed his opinion on heresies to any great extent. Tertullian calls Justin philosophus et martyr (Adv. Val. 5.1) Each title, in fact, illustrates an important aspect of Justin as a theologian. He is a fervent adherent of the Christian faith, the teaching and traditions of which he continuously puts forward in his writings, comparing and connecting them with notions of the philosophy of his time.2 1 Greek texts quoted without further indication are taken from the edition by E. J. Goodspeed, Die altesten Apologeten, Texte mit kurzen Ein leitungen, Göttingen 1914 (Apol. II is called there Appendix). For the Dialogue I generally used the English translation of A.

Gnosticism, too, had increased in the first half of the second century. It is through Justin as her spokesman that the Church engaged upon violent polemics, mainly against Marcion, which were soon to be followed by the anti-Gnostic works of Hegesippus and Irenaeus. Justin's stand against the phenomenon of heresies and the arguments he uses against these are generally nöt treated with the attention they deserve.3 To polytheistic paganism as well as to the idolatrous Jews Justin opposes Christian monotheism which, once established, is again attacked by heretical doctrines. An attempt must be made to find out which leading forces Justin saw at work behind these deviations. First, sorae general preliminary remarks must be made on Justin's understanding of God, of evil and of daemons; next his view of heresies will be dealt with. I Justin finds no difficulty in identifying God the Creator with the Demiurge of Plato's Timaeus.

DAVIDS everything out of shapeless matter for the sake of men".4 The idea of God's goodness, of His creation out of the a^opcpo? uXyj and the anthropocentric design of creation 5 are, even when set forward by Greek philosophers, to be taken as "Christian" doctrine. With the Hellenistic Jewish Apologists bef ore him Justin shares the view that Plato found his theories in the books of Moses,6 which, as Justin repeatedly says in the Dialogue, are now "Christian books", because their real meaning has been disclosed to the Christians. Besides, Justin explains the fact that some Truth can be discerned even in the pre-Christian world by his theory of the Logos spermatikos: great men, especially Socrates, were able to recognize the Truth at least in part.7 In Aftol. I, 59, 1 Justin explicitly states that creation as Plato teaches it (to euïslv, ÜAtjv afxopcpov oüaav crrpéijiavTa xóv Oeov KÓcrjxov Troirjaai) has already been taught in the first verses of the Bible; later, he identifies the Christian Sunday as the first day of creation and the day of the Lord's Resurrection,8 thus connecting in a short formula (ó Qsoc, tö ctxótoc; xat ttjv uXrjv Tpé^a^) Platonic and biblical language, the last being represented by the insertion of the darkness of Gen. 1, 2. Plato's world-soul is rendered without much explanation as the creating Logos and Son of God. The quotation, allegedly from Plato's Timaeus, "He (the Demiurge) placed him in the universe 4 Apol.

The idea that all things exist for the sake of men was shared by Stoics and Christians, as appears from Origen's reply to Celsus' criticism of the Christian doctrine that God made all things for man. Origen stresses that Stoics believe the same thing (Orig., C. Cels. IV, 74). 6 See J.

Another instance of the un problematic juxtaposition of philosophy and revelation is Justin's explanation of the cryptic words of Plato's (?) Second Letter Ta 8è Tprra Ttept to TpiTov 10 as referring to the spirit of God mentioned in Gen. 1,2. Since the Demiurge and the world-soul of the Timaeus are preserved m the Christian doctrine as Creator and divine Logos respectively, one may ask whether Justin would have any interest in explaining the other gods of the Timaeus, such as the heavenly bodies (Tim. 37-40) and "the other daimones", the mythical gods (Tim. 40 d-41 a). H. Wey has pointed out that Apol. II, 5,2 offers a solution to this problem.11 There Justin writes: "When God made the universe and put all earthly things under man's dominion, and arranged the heavenly bodies (tgc oüpavia aToi^eïa) for the increase of fruits and the change of seasons, and decreed a divine law for these, which He apparently also created for man's sake, He appointed His angels, whom He placed over mankind to look after men and all things under heaven". The juxtaposition of the heavenly bodies (though in the Timaeus not called atoi^eldc) and angels does remind one of Plato who certainly believed in "good spirits" (daemons) protecting and assisting man; 12 the concern for man, the emphasis on npóvoia, and the law given to the heavenly bodies are both Platonic and Stoic. Justin has no further explanation for the cTTor/eïa, but he continues by giving details on the angels, apparently to be identified with the "other daimones" of Tim. 40 d: "But the angels transgressed this order (ra^ic,), feil into sin with 9 Apol.

As for the &amp;XK01 Satjiovei; mentioned in Tim. 40 d after the "visible gods" who are the celestial bodies (in so far as these are ensouled living beings), they are said to be "descendants of gods". Plato is referring here to the anthropomorphic gods of traditional religion and is speaking about them with a touch of irony, combined with a certain polite respect.</page><page sequence="5">214 DR. A. DAVIDS women and begot children who are the so-called daemons (Satjjiove?)" {A-pol. II, 5,3). Here Justin is following an interpretation of the myth as recorded in Gen. 6, 1-4, where the children of the sons of God (the Codex Alexandrinus of the Septuagint reads "the angels of God") and the daughters of men are called giants, whereas Justin calls them daemons.13 The distinction between angels and the daemons, begotten by them, as present in Apol. II, 5, is not maintained elsewhere. In the Apologies, Justin speaks mostly of Scaji-ove^, often characterized as tpaüAoi or xaxot; in fact, he does not know of good daemons at all, thus distinguishing himself from contemporary Greek philosophical and religious notions. In the Dialogue he ordinarily uses the words ayyeXoL and Saifióvia, because he is speaking to Jews. In Tim. 40 d, Satfiovei; stands for Ösol, and this, together with a series of biblical texts, brings Justin to the identification of the daemons with the heathen gods. The most important Old Testa ment text, often quóted by Justin in this context is that of Ps. 95,5: otl TtavTet; ol öeoi. xüv è0v&lt;5v Saifióvia.14 For the Christian, the daemons are nothing more than fallen angels. They call the leader of the evil daemons Serpent (Öcpit;), Satan (aotTocva*;) and Devil (StocPoAot;, Apol. I, 28, 1, with reference to Apoc. 20, 2). On the (bad) angels and their sons, the daemons, as two generations (Apol. II, 5), Justin does not insist. God is without any xaxta {Apol. I, 6, r; cf. 8,2). His creation is a good one, and angels and men have been granted the gift of free will. Like other Christian writers of his day, Justin never 13 Also Philo reads in Gen. 6, 2 ol ócyy£^ol t°u Öeoü instead of ot ulo! tou 0£oG. After quoting the verse he continues: oü? aXXot 91X000901. Saifjiovat;, aYYÉXoui; Mcoua7i&lt;; eïwOev ovo^aCctv. But Philo is not the source of Justin's daemonology. In Hellenistic Judaism the theme was very popular and treated extensively esp. in 1 Henoch 6 ff. See W. Bousset-H. Gressmann, Die Religion des Juden tums im spalhellenistischen Zeitalter (Handbuch zum N.T., 21), Tübingen 4ig66, 331 ff. According to 1 Hen. 16, 1 "evil spirits" come forth from the giants, whereas Justin has daemons instead of giants. Tertullian in his reference to this myth is more explicit; he mentions, for instance, Satanas, princeps huius mali generis (Apol. 22, 2). In 1 Hen. 6, 3 the leader of the bad angels is called Semjasa, but Satanas is mentioned in 54, 6. 14 In Dial. 55, 2: ot 0eoi tgw ÈQvcöv, voju^ójiEvot 0sot, EtScoXa Satjxovtcov Etaïv, aXX' oü 0£ot. EtSuXa is taken from 1 Chron. 16, 26; cf. also Apol. I, 41; Dial. 73, 2. Elsewhere, Justin quotes the text without the etScoXa.</page><page sequence="6">JUSTIN MARTYR ON MONOTHEISM AND HERESY 215 stops emphasising this.15 In his Apologies, he contrasts the essential freedom of choice with the Stoic determinism which does not leave any room for an actual liberty of human action. Justin deals with liberty especially in a small section (ch. 43 and 44) of the long and central part of A-pol. I (ch. 30-53). In ch. 30, he gives a survey of what he wants to discuss: he wishes to prove that Christ is really, and not only apparently, the Son of God; His miracles are divine acts and not merely magie tricks. The proof (a-roSei^) of it is: We actually see happening what has been foretold in the Old Testament (a term which Justin does not use), and this of necessity leads to conviction and to believing those who predicted these things (toi&lt;; 7tpo(pY]Teuoucri 7rpiv 7] yevécröai xai' avayxYjv Trei.Qó(jLCVOi). It is only to be expected that Justin, when he comes to speak of the final goal of Christian teaching, the a&lt;p0apena (ch. 42, end), has to defend himself against the argument that "whatever takes place must necessarily do so by force of destiny" (xa0' d(j.apfiiv?)c avayxTfiv 43, 1). In his argumentation against the Stoic doctrine of predestination, which destroys man's freedom of choice (to è&lt;p' 7j[xïv and Ttpoaipetji? èXsuOépa) and does not take seriously the distinction bet ween apeTT] and xaxia, Justin stresses two things: Firstly, for Christians "predestination" can only mean "that those who choose the good shall merit rewards, just as those who prefer the contrary shall have appropriate punishments" (43,7), and, secondly, that this doctrine of final retribution reveals God's care for man, who, thereby, is urged to "reflection and remembrance" (44,11). Besides the short quotation of the com mandment to Adam, "Behold, before thy face are good and evil, choose the good" (cf. Deut. 30, 15-19 and Gen. 2,17), Justin adduces Is. 1,16-20 which is a call to repentance and ends thus: "And if you be willing and will hearken to me, you shall eat the good things of the land; but if you will not hear me, the sword shall devour you (. . .)", which "devouring sword" according to Justin is to be understood as "the fire of which those who choose to do evil shall be made the prey" (44,5). Plato had learnt this same truth from Moses; from Plato's treatment (at the end of the Republic) of the problem of the soul's immortality and the myth 15 On the insistence of the Apologists on free will see Geffcken, Zwei griechische Apologeten ] also in Melito, Hom. on the Passion, 48; Theophilus of Antiochia, Ad Autol.

The quotations given by Justin show that he is more interested in advocating a morally good life, than in facing up to the problem of predestination. He passes over God's foreknowledge of the future deeds of all men rather quickly (44,11). In Apol. II Justin returns to this problem. He mentions the criticism of "so-called philosophers", according to which the Christian doctrine on retribution is merely bluff (xó[X7roi.) intended to frighten people.16 Here Justin may have in mind his enemy Crescens, who in Apol. II, 3,1 is said to be a iptAotJ/ócpoi; and cpLAoxófiTcot; instead of cptXocrótpo^. In the Dialogue the problems of evil, free will and retribution are more explicitly connected with the existence of Satan, whose fall from God must have taken place with the seduction of Adam and Eve, and with that of his (fallen) angels. But Justin does not enter into the details of the fall, and never speaks of a defection of Satan before the creation of man. The most explicit text is: 09EC1)c,, TreuóvTot; Tcxcöaiv fxeyaXyjv Sta to arcoTTXavrjuat tyjv Eüav.17 Characteristic of Satan is his Apostasy. Justin explains Scnrava? ("a name made up from the action he performed") as a "hebrew and syriac" composition of craxa = doioa-ratT)? and va&lt;; =0911; (.Dial. 103, 5).18 He is as ó tt)&lt;; &lt;xvofita&lt;; av0pamo&lt;; (Dial. 32, 4), and ó (XTcoCTTaoóai; avOpwrco;; (Dial. 110, 2) to be identified with Antichrist, called in 2 Thess. 2,3 ó av0pwn:o&lt;; rrj&lt;; avopüoa; (or apiapxtac;). It is by using their free will in the wrong way that angels and men, both endowed with free will etc; StxaioTcpa^tav, fall into sin (Dial. 88,5; 102,4). Retribution will follow for both angels and men in conformity with their choice. At the end of the Dialogue, Justin again deals with the problem of predetermination and solves the difficulty by insisting on God's foreknowledge more exten sively than in Apol. I: "But if the word of God foretells that 16 Origen, too, reacts against Celsus' criticism that the Christians "invent terrors" (C. Cels. III, 16). 17 In Dial. 112, 3 the serpent is called θηρίον, Sc' ου ή παράβασις και παρακοή τήν αρχήν ελαβε; cf. ΙΟΟ, 4: ή &lt;*πο τ0^ οφεως παρακοή. Goodenough, The Theology, ρ. 228 says cautiously "The activity of the Serpent began with Eve". See also Puech, Les Apologistes grecs, p. 119 f., and Wey, Die Funk tionen, p. 24 ff. 18 Cf. Irenaeus, Adv. haer. V, 21, 2: Satana enim verbum hebraicum apostatam significat; also in Iren., Dem. 16.</page><page sequence="8">JUSTIN MARTYR ON MONOTHEISM AND HERESY 217 assuredly such persons, both angels and men, are to be punished, He said this beforehand because he already knew that they would become unchangeably evil; not however because God made them so".19 God has nothing to do with evil, he is free from it and did not create it. Evil is not an ontological reality apart from the Creator and existing before the creation of man; it is neither created nor desired by God. For man, xaxia consists in following an evil force, Satan, and "becoming like him". This power has constituted itself, by its own choice, as such. In Apol. II, 5, having summarized the myth of the sins of angels with human beings, Justin touches on how the fallen angels and daemons act among mankind. "Moreover, they subsequently enslaved the human race to themselves, partly by magie writings, partly by the terror and the torments which they inflicted upon them, and partly by instructing them in the use of sacrifices, incense-offerings and drink-offerings, which they need after having been enslaved to their lustful passions;20 and among men they sowed (cf. Mt. 13,39) rnurder, war, adultery, all sort of licentiousness, and every kind of evil" [Apol. II, 5, 3.4). In Apol. I, 5 Justin gives other details of the deceit of the daemons, who are the ultimate origin of the wicked rumours against the Christians, and of the persecution of wise men like Socrates, and of the Christians.21 The daemons heard what the prophets proclaimed and copied it in order to conceal the truth and to try to withdraw men from God and bind them to themselves. Among their tools are: the imitation of the Christian sacraments, their impact upon 19 Dial. 141, 2: εί δέ ό λόγος του θεοϋ προμηνύει πάντως τινάς και αγγέλους και άνθρώπους κολασθήσεσθαι μέλλοντας, διότι προεγίνωσκεν αύτούς άμεταβλήτως γενησομένους πονηρούς, προεϊπε ταϋτα, άλλ' οΰχ, δτι αύτούς ό θεός τοιούτους έποίησεν. 20 . . δια διδαχής θυμάτων και θυμιαμάτων και σπονδών, ών ενδεείς γεγόνασι μετά τό πάθεσι επιθυμιών δουλωθήναι (Apol. II, 5, 4)· The use of διδαχή here may be surprising, but the sentence forms an intentional contrast to Apol. I, 13, I : άθεοι μεν ουν ώς ουκ έσμέν, τον δημιουργόν τούδε τοϋ παντός σεβόμενοι, άνενδεή αιμάτων και σπονδών και θυμιαμάτων, ώς έδιδάχθημεν, . . . (cf. Ps. 50, 18). According to Apol. I, 12, 5 the daemons ask for θύματα και θεραπείας. 21 The texts on the destructive power of the daemons have been collected and discussed by F. Andres, Die Engellehre der griechischen Apologeten des zweiten Jahrhunderts und ihr Verhaltnis zur griechisch-römischen Damonologie (Forschungen zur christl. Lit. und Dogmengesch. XII, 3), Paderborn 1914; see also his Art. Daimon, PW Suppl. 3, 267-322; and Wey, Die Funktionen.</page><page sequence="9">218 DR A. DAVIDS the formation of mythology, their influence through magie, the idolatry and immorality they pursue, and the inspiration of disas trous laws in human society. Thus it is said that having heard the prophets announce the coming of Christ and the punishment of evil men, they spread the myths about sons begotten by Zeus "believing that they could bring men to the point of considering these prophecies about Christ as marvellous tales (TepaxoAoyia), not different from the myths as recorded by the poets" (Apol. I, 54,2). Although Justin says on one occasion that the evil daemons have enlisted the aid of the "naturally wicked lust in every man which draws him variously to all manner (of vice)" 22, and although he mentions xcoda, in which bad men take pleasure (e.g. Apol. I, 5,3), still evil and sin are more often said to be caused by the activity of Satan and the daemons. Towards the end oiApol. II evil is brought up in order to illustrate the manoeuvring of the daemons against the Christians. Justin relates briefly the story of Prodicus about "The Choice of Heracles" : Heracles meets 'Ape-r/) and Kaxta, both in the form of women (Xenophon, Mem. II, 1, 21 ff.). As Heracles was popular among the Cynics, Justin likes to introducé this hero: Crescens, attacked by Justin in Apol. II, was a Cynic philosopher {Apol. II, 3,7). Justin comments: Kcoua covers her own bad actions as it were with a screen (TtpópXr)|i.a) by putting on what in reality belongs to 'ApeTT] and imitates what is incorruptible; she enslaves the earthly-minded among men and covers 'Apzx-q with her own evil habits.23 This counterfeiting and mimicry is typical of the daemons' actions: through their calumnious reports about the Christians they cover the Christian doctrines with a garment (TCpl(3Xy)fj.a) of deceit; truth is being concealed. Justin says this in ch. 13, 1, 22 Apol. I, ίο, 6: τήν έν έκάστω κακήν προς πάντα και ποικίλην φύσει έπι θυμίαν. 23 Apol. II, II, 7: ή Υ^Ρ κακ^α&lt; πρόβλημα έαυτής των πράξεων τά προσόντα τη άρετή και όντως δντα καλά δια μιμήσεως άφθάρτων περιβαλλομένη (. . .), δουλαγωγεΐ τους χαμαιπετείς των ανθρώπων, τά προσόντα αύτη φαϋλα τή αρετή περιθεϊσα. 24 Apol. II, 13, 1; Justin laughs at the daemons' behaviour: και γάρ έγώ, μαθών περίβλημα πονηρόν εις άποστροφήν των άλλων άνθρώπων περιτεθειμένον υπό των φαύλων δαιμόνων τοις Χριστιανών θείοις διδάγμασι, και ψευδολογου μένων ταύτα και του περιβλήματος κατεγέλασα και της παρά τοις πολλοίς δόξης. In fact, the whole passage of ch. 11-13 is a word-play on words from the root βαλ-. The word-play with διάβολος is evident. Justin likes using the Cynic σπουδαιογέλοιον, see particularly Apol. II, 3, 1: Crescens is φιλόψοφος and φιλόκομπος rather than a real φιλόσοφος.</page><page sequence="10">JUSTIN MARTYR ON MONOTHEISM AND HERKSY 219 using partly the same terminology as for the imposture of Kaxia.24 This designation of the activity of the daemons reminds one of the falsehood of heretics, and the deceitful spirits and doctrines of daimonia behind them, as expressed in i Tim. 4,1, where apostasy at the end of time is predicted.25 But Justin does not speak in this context about heretical apostasy, only about daemons as authors of evil and especially as originators of the persecutions. In the Early Church, however, both persecutions and heresies were considered as apocalyptic events. II Redemption through Christ, who appeared as the whole Logos, whereas before only seeds of the Logos had been active in mankind, consists in renouncing polytheism and the daemons, or Satan.26 Although God destroyed "the powers and the authorities (cf. Eph. 6,12 and Col. 2,15) with a complete destruction by means of Him who became liable to suffering according to His will" 27, the daemons or fallen angels are still active during the interval between the two Parousiai. Their cunning is directed now towards the inspiration of heretical doctrines. The term aclpzaic, is used by Justin in the pejorative sense for Jewish and Christian sects exclusively, never for the Greek philo sophical schools.28 Each different heresy has it sown name, which is 25 Tim. 4, 1. 2 : τό δέ πνεϋμα ρητώς λέγει οτι έν ύστέροις καιροΐς άποστήσονταί τίνες της πίστεως, προσέχοντες πνεύμασιν πλάνοις και διδασκαλίαις δαιμονίων, έν ύποκρίσει ψευδολόγων (. . .). Justin hints at this text in Dial. 35, 2 against the heretics; and in Dial. 7, 3 the "old man" says of the miracles of the pseudo prophets: δπερ οί από τοϋ πλάνου και ακαθάρτου πνεύματος έμπιπλάμενοι ψευδοπροφήται ουτε εποίησαν ουτε ποιοϋσι, άλλα δυνάμεις τινάς ένεργεϊν είς κατάπληξιν των ανθρώπων τολμώσι και τά της πλάνης πνεύματα και δαιμόνια δοξολογοϋσι. 28 On redemption see Goodenough, o.c., ρ. 250 ff. 27 Dial. 41, 1, but in a paraenetic context of liturgical prayer. 28 In Dial. 62, 3 and 80, 4 Justin refers to αϊρεσις as a Jewish sect. Ac cording to Dial. 17, 1 and 108, 2 the Christians were called in Jewish anti Christian propaganda αίρεσις άθεος. For αί'ρεσις as a Christian sect see the title of Justin's Syntagma: Σύνταγμα κατά πασών τών γεγενημένων αιρέσεων συντεταγμένον (Apol. I, 26, 8) and the logion έσονται σχίσματα και αιρέσεις in Dial. 35- 3- referred to in Dial. 51, 2 : έν τώ μεταξύ της παρουσίας αύτοΰ χρόνω, ώς προέφην, γενήσεσθαι αιρέσεις (acc. to Otto; Goodspeed follows the ms. with ιερείς) και ψευδοπροφήτας έπί τω ονόματι αύτοϋ προεμήνυσε (sc. Χριστός). In Dial. 80, 3 Justin calls the heretics αίρεσιώται, a term not used before him.

DAVIDS something new in Christian literature and marks the beginning of Christian heresiology. For the Jews, this was already an ancient custom. In Dial. 80,4 Justin mentions as Jewish heresies: Sadducees, Genistae, Meristae, Galilaeans, Hellenians, Pharisees and Baptists 29, and applies to them, with apologies, a sentence from the Old Testament which dominates the whole Dialogue and is directed against the Jews in general as well as against Jewish and Christian sects: "though calied Jews and children of Abraham, and acknow ledging God with their lips, as God Himself has cried aloud, yet their heart is far from Him" [Dial. 80,4). Justin refers here to Is. 29,13, as quoted by Jesus in his controversy with the Pharisees and scribes (Mt. 15, 8.9/Mc. 7,6.7).30 Against the Christian heresies this text is hinted at in Dial. 80,3, where Justin in his reaction against false doctrines says: ού γαρ άνθρώποις μάλλον ή άνθρωπίνοις διδάγμασιν αίροΰμαι άκολουθειν, άλλα θεω και τοις παρ' εκείνου διδάγμασιν; in Dial. 35,2 the text of Is. 29,13 is also used but part of it is replaced by a reminiscence of 1 Tim. 4,1: και έκ του τοιούτους είναι άνδρας, όμολογοΰντας έαυτούς είναι Χριστιανούς και τον σταυρωθέντα Ίησουν όμολογεΐν και κύριον και Χριστόν, και μή τά έκείνου διδάγματα διδάσκοντας άλλά τά άπο των της πλάνης πνευμάτων, ήμεΐς, οί της αληθινής Ίησοϋ Χρίστου και καθαράς διδασκαλίας μαθηταί (·■·)· For the Christian sects Justin has two lists: In Apol. 26 (and again in ch. 56.58) he deals with Simon Magus, Menander and Marcion; in Dial. 35,6 he enumerates: Marcianoi (probably Mar cionites)31, Valentimans, Basilidians, and Satornilians; in the 29 See on these sects Μ. Black, The Patristic Accounts of Jewish Sectarianism, Buil. of John Rylands Library 41 (1959) 285-303; 011 the Meristae: D. Gershenson-G. Quispel, "Meristae", Vig. Chr. 12 (1958) 19-26. 30 In the Septuagint, Is. 29, 13 runs thus και εΐπεν κύριος" Εγγίζει μοι ό λαός οΰτος τοις χείλεσιν αύτών ·πμώσίν με, ή δέ καρδία αυτών πόρρω απέχει άπ' έμοϋ, μάτην δέ σέβονται με διδάσκοντες εντάλματα ανθρώπων και διδασκαλίας. In Dial. 78, 11 Justin's text comes close to this form, but in Dial. 140, 2 for example he follows the tradition as it appears in Mt. 15, 8-9/Mk. 7, 6.7. 31 See for example A. Hilgenfeld, Die Ketzergeschichte des Urchristentums urkundlich dargestelll, Leipzig 1884 (reprint Darmstadt 1963), p. 28; A. v. Harnack, Mardon. Das Evangelium vom fremden Gott.

The two catalogues show that Justin, when speaking of Christian heresies, is referring exclusively to Gnostic sects, Marcion's teaching included. It must be noted too that both chapters, Apol. I, 26 and Dial. 35 are side-tracks in Justin's two works. Obviously, he is trying to drag in something of what he said about heresies in his Syntagma. After having dealt with polytheism in general, its variations and the immorality of the pagan gods, Justin stresses in Apol. I, 26 the idea that heresy is a serious assault on monotheism: "also after Christ's ascension into heaven the daemons put forward (προεβάλλοντο) certain men who claimed to be gods" (26,1). With Justin's πρόβλημα/περίβλημα-theory in mind, one must conclude that heresies, in his eyes, also form part of the daemonic design of counterrevelation and mimicry. The link with polytheism is even more obvious in ch. 56, where Justin, when introducing Simon and Menander, refers to his earlier statements (ch. 54) about the daemonic imitation of revelation: Bef ore the coming of Christ the daemons, by spreading the myths about the "sons of Zeus" (the verb προβάλλομαι occurs in 54,2), "thinking that they would be able to make men believe that the story about Christ was of the same kind as the stories told by the poets", had tried to prevent belief in the prophets who foretold Christ's coming — Dionysus, for example was a Son of Zeus, and Bellerophon as cended to heaven on the horse Pegasus ... — ; but after His incarnation, observing that people everywhere believe and expect Him, they put forward (προεβάλλοντο) others, viz the heresiarchs. Earlier, in ch. 26, Justin had spoken of Simon Magus 32 and Menander his disciple, both from Samaria. Simon is thus considered as the immediate forerunner of (at least Menander's) Gnosticism. Simon and Menander form a kind of unit, for both together are treated again in ch. 56, while ch. 58 deals separately with Marcion, who was third in ch. 26. The claim to be a god best fits Simon. In 26,3 Simon is said to have been adored by nearly all Samaritans and even by some people abroad as ό πρώτος θεός; in Rome, too, 32 In Dial. 120, 6 Justin calls him fiayot;. See on Simon and Menander H. G. Kippenberg, Garizim und Synagoge.

DAVIDS he was honoured as a god, as is proved by the inscription on his statue there: SIMONI DEO SANCTO (26,2)—at least Justin thought it to be a statue of Simon Magus; in reality only a statue dedicated to the god Semo Sancus Deus Fidius is known. In ch. 56 Justin speaks again of Simon's statue and asks the emperor to destroy it; although ch. 58 (about Marcion) does not follow on this immediately, its conclusion seems nevertheless to hint once more at the statue: the daemons try to rivet men to earthly things and idols. Idols, says Justin elsewhere, are only called gods (cf. Apol. I, 9,2), and it is a feature of the daemons, those pseudo gods, to be called among men by the name each of them has bestowed upon himself (Apol. I, 5,2; II, 5,6). In another passage, Justin says that the Samaritans consider Simon as "god above every principality and authority and power".33 Helena, whose former licentious profession is recalled, is Simon's companion and is called his Ttpcó-rr) ewoia (26,3). This too shows Simon and Helena as very close to the daemons; syncretistic speculations liked to represent Athena as the 7tpwT7] ëwoia of Zeus (cf. Apol. I, 64, 5).34 Menander is said to have "still now" some followers. He teaches that the resurrection has already taken place (26,4). Of both Simon and Menander, Justin stresses that they stood under the power of the daemons and were skilled in magie.35 The daemonic :!3 Dial. 120, 6: about Simon, öv θεον υπεράνω πάσης άρχής και εξουσίας και δυνάμεως είναι λέγουσι (sc. the Samaritans). Α. L. Williams omits θεόν in his translation. In Dial. 120, 6 Justin refers to Apol. I. 34 On Athena as ή τοϋ Διός σύνεσις, which is found for example in the Stoic handbook of allegorical interpretation of mythology by Cornutus, see C. J. de Vogel, Greek Philosophy III, nr. 1326 b, the explanation given in small print under the text of Albinus. The reader will find there references to Philo, to Yarro ap. St. Augustine, De civ. Dei VII, 28 and to Seneca, Epist. 65, 7. Irenaeus and subsequent heresiologists give more details about Simon, ex quo universae haereses substiterunt (Adv. haer. I, 23, 2). See Hilgenfeld, o.c., p. 172 ff. Irenaeus mentions for instance statues of Simon and Helena, adored as Jupiter and Minerva (Adv. haer. I, 23, 4). 35 Apol. I, 26, 1: Simon performed miracles in Rome at the time of the emperor Claudius: διά της τών ενεργούντων δαιμόνων τέχνης δυνάμεις ποιήσας μαγικάς. About Menander: οίστρηθέντα και αύτόν ύπό τών δαιμόνων (26, 4). according to the text preserved by Eusebius, Hist. eccl. III, 26, 3; see Schmid, Die Textüberlieferung, p. 100, where can be added: 1) Also Eusebius' δαιμόνων is a better reading than δαιμονίων of the Justin-ms. Justin himself speaks in Apol. I and II only of δαίμων; in Apol. I, 5, 3 and II, 10, 5, however, he quotes from Plato, Apol. 24 b: Socrates is accused of having introduced καινά δαιμόνια; in Apol. I, 41, I he quotes from Ps. 95 (see above, note 14).</page><page sequence="14">JUSTIN MARTYR ON MONOTHEISM AND HERESY 223 inspiration of false teachers in general is emphatically expressed in Dial. 82,3: πολλοί γαρ άθεα και βλάσφημα και άδικα έν ονόματι αύτοΰ παραχαράσσοντες έδίδαξαν και τά άπο του ακαθάρτου πνεύματος διαβόλου έμβαλλόμενα ταϊς διανοίαις αύτών έδίδαξαν και διδάσκουσι μέχρι νυν. (In Dial. 69,1 Justin uses παραποιέω for the activity of the devil.) Justin undoubtedly has Simon Magus in mind when he interprets "the power of Damascus and the spoiis of Samaria" from Is. 8,4 36 as the power of the devil, "for the magicians (μάγοι, cf. Mt. 2,1), who had been carried off as spoil for all kinds of evil actions, which were wrought in them by that daemon, by coming and worshipping Christ are shown to have departed from that power (δύναμις) which had taken them as spoil, which (power) the word signified to us in a veiled form as dwelling in Damascus. And that selfsame power, as being sinful and wicked, he rightly calls Samaria in parable" [Dial. 78,9.10). Justin may even be thinking here particularly of the title δύναμις μεγάλη given to Simon according to Acts 8,10, and reappearing as such from Irenaeus onwards.37 In any case, the devil, Simon and Samaria belong together, and the tradition that holds Simon to be the father of all heresies preserves this view. After Simon-Menander Justin introducés Marcion, still alive and active at the time. Apol. I was written, and enjoying considerable influence throughout the whole world (Apol. I, 26,5). He brings his followers to "Blasphemy" with his doctrine of another, better God (άλλος θεός, μείζων) besides the Creator.38 Blasphemy, here used in connection with Marcion in particular, characterizes heretics in general elsewhere {Dial. 35,5; 80,3.4). His disciples believe him to be "the sole possessor of truth" and "laugh at us", but have no άπόδειξις for their doctrines (Apol. I, 58,2). Harnack, In the Dial. he usually writes δαιμόνι,ον, which is more biblical. 2) οΐστρηθέντα (Eusebius; the Justin-ms. has ένεργηθέντα) is used in Apol. I, 25, 1 to denote the sexual passion of Persephone and Aphrodite for Adonis. 36 Is. 8, 4 quoted in Dial. 77, 2: "For, before the child knows how to call father or mother, he shall take the power (δύναμιν) of Damascus and the spoils (σκύλα) of Samaria in the presence of the king of the Assyrians". Tertullian, Adv. Mare. III, 12. 13; Adv. Jud. 9, 1 ff. also uses this text. On the parallels with Justin see Prigent, Justin, p. 199 ff. 37 Irenaeus, Adv. haer. I, 23, 1: Simon as sublimissima virtus. 38 Apol. I, 58, 1 adds besides άλλος θεός also ετερος υιός, sc. besides Christ.</page><page sequence="15">224 DR. Α. DAVIDS in his book on Marcion (p. 8*), says of this passage39: "Verzicht auf die 'apostolische' Tradition, Verzicht auf den Altersbeweis; daher 'άπόδειξιν μηδεμίαν περί ών λέγουσιν εχοντες' und 'άλόγως' ", but in his Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte, he sees in both expressions the Marcionite rejection of an apologetic-rationalistic theology. With άπόδει,ξις I think that Justin has in mind the Marcionite "Verzicht auf den Altersbeweis", for, as Marcion rejects the Old Testament, he has of necessity no proof for his statements, since for Justin άπόδειξις consists in proving the truth by showing that it has been predicted in the Old Testament; άλόγως means "devoidof (all) logos, havingno part in the truth". The "Blasphemy" of Marcion, assisted by the daemons 40, consists in the fact that he preached two gods, a Demiurge, God of the Law, the Old Tes tament and the Jews, and a higher God, exclusively the God of Love, revealed by Christ. Justin does not, however, denounce this theory as a strict ontological dualism, opposing the two Gods as good and evil principles.41 Neither does Justin say that Marcion proclaimed himself divine; it is the "Blasphemy", in a way a return to the ancient heathen polytheism, that he attacks so violently. Occasional remarks such as those on the youth of Jesus (Apol. I. 31,7; 35,2) which for Marcion was simply irrelevant, or on the Resurrection of the body (Dial. 80,4), a thesis rejected by Marcion, cannot be interpreted with certainty as being exclusively anti Marcionite. In any case Docetism, combatted by Justin when he deals with the Virgin Birth of Christ, was not a view held by Marcion alone. However a strong anti-Marcionite bias may be 39 Apol. I, 58, 2: άπόδειξιν μηδεμίαν περί. ών λέγουσιν εχοντες, άλλα άλόγως ώς ύπό λύκου άρνες συνηρπασμένοι βορά των άθεων δογμάτων και δαιμόνων γίνονται. The expression ώς ύπί&gt; λύκου άρνες . . . could perhaps be a reference to the logion of Mt. 7, 15, par., where the pseudo-prophets are called λύκοι άρπαγες. Rhodo {ap. Eusebius, Hist. eccl. V, 13, 3) calls Marcion "the Pontic wolf". 40 Apol. I, 26, 5: δια της των δαιμόνων συλλήψεως. Polycarp of Smyrna's retort on Marcion illustrates this (Irenaeus, Adv. haer. III, 3, 4; Greek ap. Eusebius, Hist. eccl. IV, 14, 7): "Sure I recognize you; I recognize you as the firstborn of Satan". The same expression is used for docetic heretics in Polyp., Phil. 7, 1. 41 For the contradictory statements about Marcion's "dualism" in an cient Christian literature and modern criticism see E. C. Blackman, Marcion and his Influence, London 1948, p. 66 ff.; U. Bianchi, Marcion: théologien biblique ou docteur gnostique, in Vig. Chr. 21 (1967) 141-149; J. G.

Chr. 26 (1972) 53-59.</page><page sequence="16">JUSTIN MARTYR ON MONOTHEISM AND HERESY 225 recognized at the beginning of the Dialogue, immediately after the introduction. Justin asks his Jewish interlocutors, if, besides the serious charges against the Christians regarding the observance of the Law, circumcision and the keeping of the Sabbath, they also suspect the Christians of Thyestian meals and Oedipodean inter course. The Jew Trypho rejects the unworthy tittle-tattle about the Christians and wants first a debate on the significance of the Law, because "though you set your hopes on a man that was crucified, you yet hope to obtain some good from God, though you do not keep His commandments" (Dial. 10,3). Justin, how ever, starts his exposé thus: "There will never be any other God (άλλος θεός), Trypho, and there never was from ali eternity (. . .) save He who made and established this universe (πλήν του ποιήσαντος και δι,ατάξαντος τόδε το παν). Nor do we consider that we have one God, and you another, but Him only who brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt (. . .), nor have we set our hopes on any other (for there is none), but only on Him on whom you also have set yours, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob" (11,1). Justin sees it as his task to prove that the God of the Old Testament is not different from the God of the Christians, although Trypho had not put the problem in this anti-Marcionite way; Trypho had only remarked on the hope that Christians set on the crucified Jesus. Besides, neither of the two interlocutors mentions Christ's divinity explicitly: Trypho does not attack belief in it, Justin does not affirm it. The text becomes clear if one assumes that Justin first of all wants to exclude any hint of Marcionism.42 Justin concludes his considerations on Simon, Menander and Marcion in Apol. I, 26 with three remarks. First, he compares heresies with philosophy; secondly, he does not know if they practise licentiousness and cannibalism but it is surprising that they are not persecuted by the Roman authorities even for their 42 In Dial. 50, 1; 55, 1; 56 the question of άλλος θεος παρά τον ποιητήν των δλων returns. — It should be noted that, notwithstanding the gap that exists at first sight between Jewish thinking and Marcion's anti-Jewish and anti-Marcionite polemics can go hand in hand, as is also clear from Tertul lian's works Adv. Jud. and Adv. Mare. See G. Quispel, De bronnen van Tertullianus' Adversus Marcionem, Leiden 1943, and Prigent, Justin, p. 138 ff. In Adv. Mare. III, 16, 3 Tertullian calls the Jews partiarii erroris (Marcionis).</page><page sequence="17">226 DR. Α. DAVIDS doctrines.43 Thirdly, he refers to his Syntagma, which he is able to send to the emperor too. The first of these remarks is for our purpose the most important, and must be dealt with in most detail. Justin wants to explain how all followers of the heresiarchs — each with his own doctrine — can be called "Christians". It is, he says, as with the Greek philosophers who, although they do not share the same doctrines, nevertheless share the name philos ophy.44 The same idea has been expressed earlier in the A-pol., as Justin himself points out: και γάρ τοι φιλοσοφίας ονομα και σχήμα, επιγράφονται τίνες, ο'ί ούδέν άξιον της υποσχέσεως πράττουσι· γινώσκετε δ' οτι και οΐ τα εναντία δοξάσαντες και δογματίσαντες των παλαιών τω ένί ονόματι προσαγορεύονται φιλόσοφοι (Apol. I, 4. 8) 1 and: καθόλου μεν ουν κάκεΐνο όμολογοΰμεν, οτι δν τρόπον οί έν "Ελλησι τά αύτοΐς αρεστά δογματίσαντες (these last words correspond to the meaning of αίρεσις as "choice" and "school", but Justin does not use the word in this sense) έκ παντός τω ένί ονόματι φιλοσοφίας προσαγορεύονται, καίπερ των δογμάτων εναντίων δντων, ούτως και των έν βαρβάροις γενομένων και δοξάντων σοφών τό έπικατηγορούμενον ονομα κοινόν έστι· Χριστιανοί γάρ πάντες προσαγορεύονται [Apol. I, 7, 3) — βάρβαροι meaning here the non-Greeks among whom the Logos became man (cf. Apol. I, 5,4), and who have access to divine wisdom. Among these are men who have really become wise as well as those who merely seemed to be wise, viz the heretics (γενομένων και δοξάντων σοφών). Justin opposes the Christian σοφία of the βάρβαροι to the merely human wisdom of the Greek philosophers. This can be illustrated by Apol. I, 60,11: παρ' ήμΐν ούν έστι ταϋτα άκοΰσαι και μαθεΐν παρά τών ούδέ τούς χαρακτήρας τών στοιχείων επισταμένων, ιδιωτών μεν και βαρβάρων τό φθέγμα (Cf. Acts 4,13)1 σοφών δέ και πιστών τόν νουν όντων, και πηρών και χήρων τινών τάς όψεις· ώς συνεϊναι ού σοφία ανθρωπεία ταϋτα γεγονέναι, άλλά δυνάμει θεοΰ λέγεσθαι (Cf. I Cor. 2, 3"5)- According to J. Η. Waszink 45 οί βάρβαροι in Apol. I, 5,4 and 7,3 is equivalent to 43 In this context it is important to note that Apol. I, 16, 14 must be understood as a request for persecution of the heretics. 44 Apol. I, 26, 6: πάντες οί άπό τούτων (sc. the heresiarchs) ορμώμενοι, ώς εφημεν {Apol. I, 4. 8; but mainly 7, 3), Χριστιανοί καλούνται, δν τρόπον και ού κοινών δντων τών δογμάτων τοις φιλοσόφοις τό έπικαλούμενον ονομα της φιλοσοφίας κοινόν έστιν.

If the above interpretation of I, 7,3 (with γενομένων και δοξάντων σοφών) is correct, βάρβαροι there stands for more than the Jews (and Samaritans) alone, because Marcion, one of the heretics known to Justin, is in fact from Pontus. Justin further develops this correspondence between heresies and the various philosophical schools in his Dialogue, the relevant texts of which have been discussed by J. C. M. van Winden in his valuable commentary on'the introduction to the Dialogue. 46 Concerning the different heresies Justin states in Dial. 35,4-6: "There are (. . .), and have been (. . .), many who have taught others to say and to do things godless and blasphemous, coming up in the name of Jesus (cf. Mt. 24,5); and they are called by us according the name of the men from whom each doctrine and teaching started. (5) For some in one way and some in another teach men to blaspheme the Maker of the universe and the Christ that was prophesied by Him as about to come, and the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. With none of whom do we hold communion, who know that they are godless and impious and unrighteous and lawless, and instead of worshipping Jesus acknowledge Him only in name. (6) And they call themselves Christians just like the heathens inscribe the name of the god upon their idols made by hands, and take part in lawless and godless rites. And some of them are called Marcianoi, and some Valentinians, and some Basilidians, and some Saturnilians, and others by other names, each being named from the originator of the doctrine, just as also each of those who think they are philosophers, as I said already in the beginning [Dial. 2,2) thinks it right to bear the name of the father of that system".47 Justin demoiselle Christine Mohrmann, Utrecht-Anvers 1963, p. 41-56, 49. For Justin's argument see also Irenaeus, quoted among other texts by Otto, Corpus Apologetarum Christianorum, I (Jena ρ. 162 f.: Hanc fidem qui sine litteris crediderunt, quantum ad sermonem nostrum, barbari sunt: quantum autem ad sententiam et consuetudinem et conservationem, propter fidem perquam sapientissimi sunt [Adv. haer. III, 4, 2). 48 J C. M. van Winden, An Early Christian Philosopher, p. 42 ff. Schmid, Die Textüberlieferung, p. 94 f., in contrast to Pfattich's commentary on Justin, rejects a relating of Apol. I, 26, 6 with Dial. 2, 2, but does not give clear reasons. 47 Dial. 35, 4-6: εΐσίν ούν και έγένοντο (...) πολλοί οί άθεα και βλάσφημα λέγειν και πράττειν έδίδαξαν, έν ονόματι τοϋ Ίησοϋ προσελθόντες (Cf.

DAVIDS reasons as follows: Christ has foretold that at the end of the age many pseudo-prophets, pseudo-Christs and pseudo-apostles will appear. Justin has just quoted some important logia of Jesus in Dial. 35,3.48 Many such men, heretics, have already appeared or are active now. We call them according to the name of the heresiarchs, but they call themselves Christians.49 Dial. 35,5 is a parenthesis that combines the "Blasphemy" against the Creator and Christ, which in Justin's eyes is a particular feature of Marcion's doctrine 50, with the theme of the "God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob", known already from the beginning of the Dialogue. If one takes Dial. 35,6 separately, the reasoning there is: they call themselves Christians, but in reality they are not; they are Mar cianoi, etc. For both elements of this statement Justin offers comparisons. For they call themselves Christians he refers to the idols and establishes a relation between heresies and the daemons. The heretics are pseudo-Christians, whereas the statues of the heathen deities are, as can be noted from their inscriptions, only called gods; in reality they are merely material forms of the daemons and images of the pseudo-gods.51 Of course, Justin will also be ποιητήν τών όλων και τον ύπ' αύτοϋ προφητευόμενον έλεύσεσθαι Χριστόν και τον θεόν 'Αβραάμ και 'Ισαάκ και 'Ιακώβ διδάσκουσα' ών ούδενί κοινωνοϋμεν, οί γνωρίζοντες άθέους και. ασεβείς και άδικους και άνομους αυτούς ύπάρχοντας, και άντί τοΰ τον Ίησοϋν σέβειν ονόματι μόνον δμολογεϊν.

They combine elements of Mt., esp. Mt. 7, 15; 24, 5.11.24. In addition. Justin quotes the logion noted above in n. 28. 49 Van Winden, An Early Christian Philosopher, p. 43, understands Dial. 35, 6 differently: the heretics "call themselves" Marcianoi, etc. "each one calling himself . . .".

I. For the second element: in reality they are not Christians; they are Marcianoi, etc. Justin draws a parallel with the different philosophical schools, and refers to the introduction of the Dialogue, where he has ex plained his view on philosophy: "Philosophy is really the greatest and most honourable thing man can possess. It alone brings us to and unites us with God, and truly sacred are those who apply themselves to philosophy. What philosophy really is and why it was sent down (κατεπέμφθη) to men have escaped the masses. Otherwise there would be no Platonists, Stoics, Peripatetics, Theoreticians and Pythagoreans. For philosophy is one science (μιας ούσης ταύτης επιστήμης)". (Then Justin explains how philos ophy has become a many-headed monster, πολύκρανος.) "Those who were first (οΐ πρώτοι) came in contact with philosophy and thus became famous. Their successors (ot επειτα) followed them blindly without any search for truth; they were simply impressed by their predecessors' perseverance and self-discipline and by the unusual quality of their sayings. They believed that what each had learnt from his teacher was true. They (αύτοί) handed these and similar doctrines on to others (οί επειτα) and were like wise named after the father of the system" (Dial. 2, 1.2).52 It has been recognized that the source of Justin's statement here about primordial philosophy is Posidonius' Protrepticus 53, but Van Winden stresses the fact that Justin gave the Posidonian terminology another content. Since Justin has in mind the founders 52 Translation in Van Winden, o.c., p. 42, but the last words there are: "They handed these doctrines on to others and were named after the father of the system by their adherents". The Greek text reads: (συνέβη) είτα και αυτούς, τοις έπειτα παραδόντας τοιαύτα άττα και άλλα τούτοις προσεοικότα, τοΰτο κληθηναι τούνομα, όπερ έκαλεϊτο ό πατήρ του λόγου. 53 See Van Winden, l.c.} with reference to N.

Joly, Chris tianisme et philosophie. Etudes sur Justin et les Apologistes grecs du deuxième siècle, Brussels 1973, has criticized the posidonian origin of Justin's passage. He calls Hyldahl's thesis "un des (derniers?) avatars du panposidonisme, si typique de l'érudition allemande" (p. 24), and notes this difference be tween Posidonius and Justin: "Posidonius nous parle d'une Urphilosophie mais non d'une décadence de la philosophie, alors que Justin parle d'une décadence de la philosophie, mais non d'une Urphilosophie". On ne peut établir entre les deux auteurs la moindre filiation raisonnable" (p. 26). In this context, Joly points at Antiochus of Ascalon as an important source for Justin's affirmations (p. 34 ff.).</page><page sequence="21">230 DR. Α. DAVIDS of the different philosophical schools, "his 'first men' are only relatively first", but "in Posidonius' view there is nobody earlier than the 'wise men' " (p. 44). For Justin, real, primordial philos ophy is the revelation of the Old Testament. Before all the so called philosophers and much earlier than they lived the prophets, who "alone saw the truth and announced it to mankind" (Dial. 7,1). Elsewhere, Justin offers a slight variation on this theme of primordiality, by calling the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob the "first of all men to engage upon the inquiry about God" (Apol. I, 63,17), but he is led to this formulation by the revelation to Moses in Exod. 3,14-15, quoted in the context as: Έγώ είμι ό ών, ό θεός 'Αβραάμ και ό θεός 'Ισαάκ και ό θεός 'Ιακώβ και ό θεός των πατέρων σου. In Apol. I, the comparison between heresies and the different philosophical schools ends with the affirmation that one should not be misled by the fact that people with such different opinions are all called Christians — just as the existence of different philo sophical schools does not prevent all philosophers from being called "philosophers" —; among the "Christians" there are heretics who should be punished. In the Dialogue Justin proceeds to explain that it is not right that heretics should use the name "Christians"; they have their own names, always derived from a heresiarch. But the correspondence between heresies and philosophical schools should not be pushed too far. Common to both philosophical schools and heresies is the fact that they deviated from Truth. Of the philosophical schools listed by Justin in Dial. 2,1, only the Platonists and the Pythagoreans are called after the founder of the respective philosophies, whereas of the heresies mentioned in Dial. 35,6 all forms are derived from heresiarchs.54 More important however, is another difference. All philosophers, the founders of the schools included, fall under "the so-called philosophers".55 Among the philosophers there were some who taught "atheism" 54 Illustrative for Justin's view are Hegesippus ap. Eusebius, Hist. eccl. IV, 22, 5: ... ψευδόχρι,στοι, ψευδοπροφηται, ψευδοαπόστολοι, οίτινες έμέρισαν τήν ενωσιν της έκκλησίας. And Clement of Alexandria, Strom. VII, 17, 108: των δ' αιρέσεων at μέν άπό ονόματος προσαγορεύονται, ώς ή άπο Ούαλεντίνου και Μαρκίωνος και Βασιλείδου, καν τήν Ματθίου αΰχώσι προσάγεσθαι δόξαν' μίαν γάρ ή πάντων γέγονε των αποστόλων ώσπερ διδασκαλία, ούτως δε και ή παράδοσις. But, Clement continues, there are also heresies called after a geographical name, a nation, etc.; he mentions twelve heresies in all. 55 Cf. Van Winden, p. 44 and p. 112.</page><page sequence="22">JUSTIN MARTYR ON MONOTHEISM AND HERESY 231 {Apol. I, 4,9), but also some good ones, Socrates in particular, or Heraclitus, or Plato, who saw Truth dimly 56 on account of the "seeds of Truth" (σπέρματα άληθείας, Apol. I, 44,10) in them. On the other hand, Justin does not make such exceptions for the heretics. They are all closely connected with the free defection of Satan from God. Α fragment, possibly from Justin's Syntagma and copied already by Irenaeus, illustrates this quite clearly: "Truly has Justin remarked: That bef ore the Lord's.appearance Satan never dared to blaspheme God, inasmuch as he did not yet know his own sentence, because it was contained in parables and allegories', but that after the Lord's appearance, when he had clearly ascertained from the words of Christ and His Apostles that eternal fire has been prepared for him as he apostatized from God of his own free will, and likewise for all who unrepentant continue in the apostasy, he nova blasphemes, by means of such men, the Lord who brings judgment (upon him) as being already condemned, and imputes the guilt of his apostasy to his Maker, not to his own voluntary disposition. Just as it is with those who break the laws, when punishment overtakes them: they throw the blame upon those who frame the laws, but not upon themselves".57 It is not difficult to recognize the anti-Marcionite bias of this fragment. "Blasphemy" is according to Apol. I Marcion's sin, directed overtly against God himself. In Irenaeus the context is strongly anti-Marcionite, though not exclusively so: Qui ergo blasphemant Demiurgum — 56 Apol. II, 13, 5: οί γάρ συγγραφείς πάντες διά της ένούσης έμφύτου τοϋ λόγου σποράς άμυδρώς έδύναντο όράν τά δντα J. Daniélou, Message évangélique et culture hellénistique au IIe et IIIe siècles (Histoire des doctrines chrétiennes avant Nicée, II, Coll. Bibliothèque de Théologie), Paris 1961, p. 50, n. 2 points out that the expression, also used by Clement of Alexandria (Strom. I, 16, 80, 5}, is of Platonic origin and refers to Albinus, Did. 27, 4. Elsewhere, Justin says οΰκ άκριβώς (Apol. I, 54, 4; cf. 44, 10; 60, 5). 57 Translation in the Ante-Nicene Fathers, I (New York 1905), p. 555. The Latin text has been preserved by Irenaeus in his passage on the Anti christ or diabolica apostasia (Adv. haer. V, 25, I), Adv. haer. V, 26, 2; the Greek original by Eusebius only partly, Hist. eccl. IV, 18, 9, but entirely by the Catenae (J. A. Cramer, Catenae Graecorum Patrum in Novum Testamen tum VIII, Oxford 1840, reprint Hildesheim 1967, p. 81 f.)—Another Justi nian fragment quoted by Irenaeus, Adv. haer. IV, 6,2 (cf. also Eusebius, Hist. eccl. IV, 18, 9) is said by Irenaeus to come from Justin's Syntagma against Marcion, which might be identical with Justin's Syntagma against all the Heresies.—I give here the text as printed by Otto, Corpus III, p. 252-254 :</page><page sequence="23">232 DR. Α. DAVIDS vel ipsis verbis et manifeste quemadmodum qui a Marcione sunt, vel secundum eversionem sententiae quemadmodum qui a Valentino sunt et omnes qui falso dicuntur esse Gnostici —, organa Satanae ab omnibus Deum colentibus cognoscantur esse, per quos Satanas nunc et non ante ausus est maledicere Deo, qui ignem aeternum praeparavit omni apostasiae (Adv. haer. V, 26,2). This is, except for the explanation vel ipsis verbis . . . esse Gnostici strong Justinian language. Justin must have spoken about Marcion in the text preceding the fragment and may have mentioned other heretics: the words "by means of such men" (hia. των τοιούτων άνθρώπων) introducé the heretics too abruptly. The heretical Apostasy is closely associated with Satan's free defection from God; it seems also that through Marcion Satan tries to present God as the cause of evil, although nowhere else does Justin speak clearly of Marcion as teaching both an "evil" and a "good God". The here^ies are the last, hopeless attempt of the devil against God. Justin says elsewhere, that before Christ, the devils, or Satan, had knowledge of the punishment which will be inflicted upon evil men (Apol. I, 54,2), and that after Christ, unmasked, they hate Truth still more (cf. Apol. II, 8). But the fragment adds that they did not know clearly of their final condemnation as the final crushing of their apostasy. When speaking of the parables and allegories of the Old Testament, Justin may have had in mind the prophet Daniël, but also other biblical texts which he quoted elsewhere. The categorical words of Christ and the Apostles, which he refers to are the description of the Last Judgment in Mt. 25,31-46, where the Son of Man condems those at his left hand with the words "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels" (Mt. 25,41). On several occasions, as we have noted, Justin speaks of followers of Satan, whether angels or men; in the fragment, Justin concentrates on heretics and, therefore, does not even mention the angels. The words of the προ μέν της του κυρίου παρουσίας ούδέποτε έτόλμησεν ό σατανάς βλασφημήσαι τον θεόν, άτε μηδέπω είδώς αύτοϋ τήν κατάκρισιν, διά τό έν παραβολαΐς και άλληγορίαις κεΐσθαι.

When Justin sees heresies as the final outburst of daemonic action, he is only bearing witness to the theology of the Early Church, according to which the end of the world was at hand and already prepared for by persecutions and heresies. Indeed, Christ has foretold both; thinking of Christ's words on the end of time (esp. Mt. 24), he says: "For He (the Lord) said that we must be slain and hated for His name's sake, and that many false prophets and false Christs would come forward in His name, and would lead many astray" (Dial. 82, 2). Justin constantly fits the problem of heresies into this view of the world and its end. The chapter on heresies Dial. 35 is particularly illustrative: at the beginning Justin says that the existence of heresies makes Christians "more faithful and stronger in the hope that was announced by Him (Jesus Christ)", and at the end confesses to praying "both for you and for all others who are at enmity with us, that you may repent with us, and not blaspheme (cf. Is. 52,5) Christ Jesus (. . .), and by believing in Him you may be saved in that second advent which is to take place in glory, and may not be condemned by Him to the fire".58 Justin's vindication of monotheism is closely related to his anti-Gnostic and, above all, anti-Marcionite attitude. The Greek polytheistic world is explained as a host of daemons, identical with the fallen angels, besieging the truth of revelation. Satan, whose name is explained as Apostate and Serpent, is the leader of this hostile world. Evil originates from the free will of Satan, the fallen angels and men; it cannot be imputed to the Creator. Justin is silent about a pre-cosmic fall. It is a common ancient Christian belief that heresies, together 58 No Christian author before Justin displays his anti-Jewish feelings so openly. On Justin's intolerance see further details in Joly (note 53), p. 155 ff.: Le ,,doux" Justin.</page><page sequence="25">234 DR. A. DAVIDS with persecutions, are apocalyptic signs of the end of time, which is approaching. Equally well testified is the conception of heresy as daemonic conceit. But Justin is the first to deal (in Apol. I, 26.56.58) with heresies separately and chronologically: from Simon Magus and Menander (even treated "genealogically", Menander being the disciple of Simon) to Marcion. Justin is also the first to record several Gnostic heresies by name (Dial. 35). Regarding the different names and the various doctrines, Justin compares heresies with the different philosophical schools, but he does not think of heresiarchs as deriving their teaching from a special philosophical system of doctrine. Heresiarchs are put forward by Satan as his final protest against and alternative to the Christian doctrine which after Christ has reached the whole world. All daemonic apostasy will be crushed and condemned at the Last Judgment. Only a few chapters of Justin's extant works deal with the problem of heresies. But, as a fragment preserved by Irenaeus and the Catenae shows, elsewhere too Justin 59 has presented heresies as Satan's final attempt to obstruct the work of God. Through heresies Satan diredly 'blasphemes' the Creator and tries to draw mankind away from monotheism. 59 Also in the missing portion between Dial. 74, 3 and 4. Justin may have spoken of daemons and idolatry, as he has quoted there from Deut. 31. Dial. 74, 3 preserved the end of the quotation, viz. Deut. 31, 16-18 about punishment for the Jews who have turned to "other gods".</page></plain_text>
