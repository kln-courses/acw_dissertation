<plain_text><page sequence="1">Notorious freethinkers and democrats INER DEMPSEY finds the 1790s spirit of radical inquiry alive in 19th-century Belfast HISTORICALLY, ALL FORMS of orthodox thinking tend towards ossification. Progress in both ideas and institutions has thus tended to occur only after orthodoxy has been challenged by a critical and inquiring mind. This usually means that the challenger has to pay the social penalties of dissent, from vilification through censorship and persecution to, in extreme cases, the ultimate sacrifice. We can see aspects of this process in the career of Thomas Paine. It is difficult for us to appreciate fully how great an impact Paine had on the world in his day, and his influence in Belfast and elsewhere in Ireland was profound. Through the wide dissemination of the Rights of Man and its eager reception by a populace seeking radical social and political reform in the 1790s, Paine can be viewed as one of the ideological architects of the 'Athens of the North'. His ideas, democratic to the core, anticipated much of what we take for granted today, including public education for all, state pensions and maternity benefits. Yet Paine was reviled, in the most abusive language, as some sort of atheistic monster (in fact, he was a deist) intent solely on the destruction of a divinely-ordained order of things. Even as late as 1901, the orthodox view of Paine was expressed by Rev James Woods, in NuttalPs Encyclopedia: "a notorious free thinker and democrat". As we know, the spirit which animated the cultural and intellectual life of Belfast during the closing years of the 18th century was severely repressed, and a period which seemed to offer so much hope ended in comprehensive social and political disaster. But the repression by authority did not entirely smother that spirit. Indeed, it remained obdu rately alive, finding expression in a variety of societies which sprang up during the 19th century and which, interestingly, reflected growing class divisions as commerce and industry flourished and the city pros pered. The intellectual energy which had formerly been expended on social and political issues was redirected into other, apparently less con tentious, channels. One of these channels was scientific study of the past?the very distant past. Despite opposition from churchmen, geologists were 8</page><page sequence="2">making headway in proving that the earth was considerably older than Archbishop Ussher's creation date of 4004 BC, and antiquarians were unearthing the 'rude stone implements' of prehistoric man, necessitat ing a revision of conventional ideas about the past. As the century wore on, the greatest challenge to orthodoxy?and the most significant stimu lus to free thought?came from this unlikely quarter. As with the radical political and social challenge ofthe 1790s, Belfast was to play a promi nent role in this scientific challenge. In geology, archaeology and anthropology, the re-examination of received ideas and the search for new methods of understanding the origins ofthe human race and the development of ancient cultures was, little by little, undermining the notion mat the Bible provided all the answers for all time (though it should be pointed out that it was never the avowed aim of science to repudiate the Christian faith). This process, however, was to set the stage for another battle in the age-old war between freedom and authority. The opening salvo came in the year 1859, revered in Ulster as the 'Year of Grace'. The publication that year of Darwin's The Origin of Species brought religion into direct conflict with science. The acrimo nious verbal duel at Oxford the following year between Huxley and Bishop Wilberforce was to set the tone for much of what followed. During the 1860s in Belfast, the debate was initially conducted in a more decorous fashion. Described by Rev (later Canon) William Mcll waine of St George's, a well-known defender of orthodoxy, as a "remarkable treatise" by one ofthe "ablest advocates" ofthe Darwinian theory, Joseph John Murphy's paper to the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society was generally well received. Mcllwaine, in his role as president ofthe Belfast Naturalists' Field Club, was responding to Murphy's paper by examining the Darwinian theory under the title 'The Continuity of Creation'. While he commended Murphy's paper in terms of its matter and "the spirit which pervaded it", he dissented from its conclusions and went on to claim for Moses "the character of a historian in recording the fact" of creation, urging the Field Club to adopt the "Mosiac account ofthe origin ofthe world in preference to the Darwinian hypothesis". Such polite exchanges were not to last. By 1874, the gloves were off. That year the British Association for the Advancement of Science held its annual meeting in Belfast. Professor John Tyndall, Carlow-born, largely self-educated, a friend of Huxley and one of the leading physi cists of the day, opened the proceedings as president with a paper entitled 'The Origin of Things?anthropomorphic ^|fi?^jL view'. It was to become notorious. An emotional ^^^m\ polemic ensued that lasted for years. In the words of o S^jmk[ ^ the Belfast News Letter, it "burst like a storm over the te^^^m^ ? waters of the intellectual life of Ulster and stirred them i \| \|?l/i E to their depths." Tyndall's statements had "provoked ^Mm the keenest discussion and evoked considerable feel- ^^Spr ing. While the man of science hailed them as the ^s?^ utterances of one seeking the truth, the theologian branded them as an attack on all that is sacred and Divine." The News Letter's retrospect hoped that there would be "a greater independence of thought and a union of all classes in Ireland in the peaceful pursuit of science." It was a somewhat forlorn hope. Tyndall had implied that science did not seek any fixed and final account of things. New evidence in all fields was rapidly expanding the boundaries of knowledge and rendering much of the hitherto accepted knowledge invalid. This march of science was not to be halted. He claimed for science "unrestricted rights of search" and bluntly told his audience: ... I thought you ought to know the environment which, with or without your consent, is rapidly surrounding you, and in relation to which some adjustment on your part may be necessary ... The following Sunday, in Protestant churches all over Belfast, sermons of denunciation were preached to their flocks and the Catholic bishops issued a long pastoral of condemnation. None was more vociferous than the acerbic Rev Mcllwaine. Giving his presidential address to the Belfast Naturalists' Field Club, in November that year, he described Tyndall's address as "... the tocsin of a religious and scientific warfare which spread from Belfast as a centre to all parts of the world." It was a " ... bold assertion of not only mate rialistic but even atheistic principles ..." and "an attack on the funda mentals of Christianity." Orthodoxy, however, could only fight a rearguard action. By 1889, it had lost ground. The difference in tone and attitude between clergy and laity is apparent in the presidential address of Hugh Robinson to the Field Club. Reviewing the progress of science since its formation in 1863, he said: The question which has undoubtedly engrossed most of the attention of science since that time has been that of evolution... Our club was formed at a time when the arguments pro and con waxed fast and furious and, as year by year since the matter has been investigated, the strong feelings on either side have toned down; Deductions based on insufficient premises have been abandoned, and investigators have settled down to the even tenor of their ways. While we may hesitate to give our adhesion to many of the propositions laid down, we cannot deny the fact that the promulgation of this theory has led to a vast increase in the spirit of inquiry [my emphasis] and that the study of natural science received a greater impulse than it ever received before. In asserting this, Robinson was recognising that, while there was much that was still a matter for conjecture (in itself a validation of the sceptical approach), declamation could not usurp the place of systematic inves tigation. Empirical knowledge was gradually being unshackled from the trammels of religious dogmatism. Coupled with a commitment to basic social agreement, free thought? that humanitarian spirit of open and honest inquiry, a continuous critical examination of ideas?is the best antidote to an irrational faith in obsolete systems and outmoded ways of thinking. What was good enough for 'me da' is NOT good enough for me. I want to see a unity of culture and politics adequate to the present, not the past; a unity in which all can participate and which seeks to expand rather than limit different forms of thought and belief; a unity in which 'civil and religious liberty for all' is a truly meaningful, living concept. Because it begins from a position of self-questioning and self-doubt, free thinking represents a valid and positive attitude for the 1990s and beyond. Personal, rather than national, self-determination should be its objective. By such means, we may be able to fulfil some of the promises of the past?rather than being doomed to repeat its mistakes?and begin to cultivate an imaginative understanding of others that could lead to a more tolerant and decent society.
