<plain_text><page sequence="1">Two Polynesian repatriation enigmas at the Smithsonian Institution Adrienne L. Kaeppler Smithsonian Institution The Smithsonian brass patu: an object with multiple identities Some of the first scientific fieldwork in the Pacific was carried out by the officers and scientists aboard HMS Endeavour, under the command of James Cook. One of the scientists to travel on Cook's first voyage (1768-71), sent to observe the transit of Venus in Tahiti, was young Joseph Banks. A member of the landed gentry, Banks was especially interested in botany, but also collected ethnographic artifacts. Besides visiting Tahiti and other islands in central Polynesia, the voyage also travelled to the land now known as New Zealand. While in New Zealand Joseph Banks acquired a basalt hand weapon, called patu onewa, from one of the important Maori men, which he took back with him to England. Banks then planned to travel on Cook's next voyage to the Pacific, and had forty brass replicas of his patu made to give as gifts to the Maori. These brass patu were made in the brass foundry of Eleanor Gyles in London in 1772. They were then engraved with his name (Jos Banks), the date (1772) and his family's 'shield of arms' by Thomas Orpin, also in London. After a disagreement concerning his accommodation on the ship, Banks did not travel on the second voyage. However, it is thought that before Cook's third voyage, Banks gave some of the brass patu to Charles Clerke, Commander of Cook's companion ship, to use as gifts or trade items. During this voyage, Cook's ships stopped in various places on the north-west coast of America, and a few of these brass patu were given or exchanged to native Americans. One of these brass patu was exchanged between native Americans, and eventually traveled inland to Umatilla, Oregon. In the 1890s it became part of the collection of Helen Kane Kunzie, who sold it to the Smithsonian Institution in 1897 (Figure 1). This brass patu, now in the Anthropology Department of the Smithsonian Institution, has had an exciting social life, and has acquired several identities during the past two centuries. As it is a replica of a Maori traditional object, it has a Maori association. As it was made in England, it has an English association - and more specifically, it has a known original owner, Sir Joseph Banks. It was traded among native Americans, acquiring along the way a native American association. Finally, its 108 years residence in the Smithsonian Institution has given it a Smithsonian association as a treasured object with a varied past. The locations of only six of these brass patu are known. Four are in museums in England,1 one is in a private collection, and then there is the Smithsonian example - which is the only one known in the United States. 152 Journal of Museum Ethnography 17 (2005)</page><page sequence="2">Two Polynesian repatriation enigmas at the Smithsonian Institution Figure 1. The Banks brass patu in the Smithsonian Institution (Al 7 4002). The National Museum of the American Indian Act of 1989, amended 1996, requires the Smithsonian Institution to inventory and identify the tribal origins of all native American human remains and funerary objects in its possession. In compliance with this law, the Smithsonian Repatriation Office initiated the documentation of possible funerary objects potentially affiliated with the Umatilla in response to a larger request for repatriation by various tribes in the Plateau region. Included among the potential funerary objects was the brass patu, which for repatriation inventory and assessment had been moved to a different area of the Smithsonian storage building. I was looking for the patu for a different reason, and not being able to find it in its usual storage place, was told by our collections management staff that it was among the materials from Umatilla that were being considered for repatriation and that a consultation visit from the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation was planned for July 2001. I was surprised and concerned that a New Zealand Maori/English object was being considered for repatriation to the Umatilla. I informed the repatriation staff of its significance and explained that anything associated with Cook's voyages has acquired a kind of sacred mana in the Pacific. After my explanation of its Pacific importance they asked me to explain this to the visitors from Umatilla, which I did. Journal of Museum Ethnography 1 7 (2005) 153</page><page sequence="3">Advienne L. Kaeppler The Umatilla visitors did not know about such objects or their significance, nevertheless the Umatilla asked for its repatriation. When I found that our Repatriation Office would be offering thQpatu to the Umatilla, I tried to understand the reasoning behind this offer. As an ethnologist, to me the primary association is with the Maori, secondly with the English, and thirdly with the Umatilla. However, according to repatriation policy, the primary association is with the last American Indian owner and other previous associations have no standing. The primary evidence that repatriation takes into consideration is the information given by the person from whom the Smithsonian received the object. In this case, this is the list of objects that the collector, Helen Kunzie, wished to sell to the Smithsonian. In her list, Mrs Kunzie designates the majority of her collection to 'Umatilla graves', including the patu. It is well known that nineteenth-century collectors kept very poor records for specific objects, but in discussing Mrs Kunzie's collection in the 1 889 Annual Report of the Smithsonian, Reverend Myron Eells noted that she had 'many valuable articles' from a cemetery near the Umatilla Landing, and specifically mentions a metate that came from this area. He does not mention the patu.2 However, an article published by a James Wickersham claims that the patu came from 'an ancient grave ... on the Columbia river bluffs opposite Umatilla, in Klickitat County, Washington' (Wickersham 1895). As Kunzie and Wickersham give the patu two different provenances, I question both of them. Was the patu really in a grave? If so, what grave? How old was this grave? What does 'ancient' mean? Only the last question can be answered from the historical evidence. As will be seen, by 'ancient' Wickersham meant pre-European. The article by Wickersham contains compelling and important information, which I feel is of equal, or more, value in determining the history of the patu than Mrs Kunzie's vague reference to 'Umatilla graves'. However, according to repatriation regulations, Wickersham's article, and its embedded theory, is only a secondary source. Here are some complexities that derive from Wickersham's article. Wickersham claimed that the patu came from an 'ancient grave', by which, it will be shown below, he meant pre-European. But, if it came from a grave, the grave cannot be pre-European. The patu could not have been collected on the coast before 1778 (when Cook's ships called during the third voyage) and at least two ship captains - James Colnett in 1787 and John Meares 1788-9 - saw brass patu on the north-west coast (Colnett 1797; Meares 1790). It would have taken some trading time to get a patu from the north-west coast, where it was first traded from Cook's ship, to a site along the Columbia River, which is considerably inland at the far eastern confluence of the states of Washington and Oregon with Idaho, and was an area of trade, interaction and gambling. And, since the patu was in the private collection of Mrs Helen Kane Kunzie by 1895, when she attempted to sell her collection to the Smithsonian, it was only in North America for 117 years and could not have been in a pre-European grave. Why is this important? Because Wickersham's designation of the patu to an 'ancient grave' was an effort to authenticate the object as indigenous Native American in order to prove a theory. 154 Journal of Museum Ethnography 17 (2005)</page><page sequence="4">Two Polynesian repatriation enigmas at the Smithsonian Institution Kunzie had other unusual objects in her collection, such as grinding stones and calendar stones that were noted 'no other known'. In order to be given an indigenous 'Native American authenticity' such objects needed to have come from graves, and especially 'ancient graves'. The list sent by Mrs Kunzie was probably made in order to try to sell the collection to the Smithsonian, which can be seen from phrases in her list, such as, that specific objects 'are unrepresented in Smithsonian collection'. Mrs Kunzie knew about Wickersham's article, where he says that the patu came from an ancient grave, as she cites it in her letter to the Smithsonian in which she offers her collection for sale. The reason that Wickersham wanted the patu to come from an 'ancient grave' is even more interesting. He was attempting to prove his theory that 'the bronze of Mexico reached the Columbia river. . .' and that a Mexican object called a 'Macana' was of the same shape as objects from Colorado, Columbia river [e.g. the patu] and northward' (Wickersham 1895: 75). Thus, his attributed provenance of the patu to an 'ancient grave' in Washington, 'opposite Umatilla' would give credence to his theory. Wickersham also theorized that this patu indicated that this weapon type went from the north-west coast to Polynesia. Furthermore, Mr Thomas Wilson of the Smithsonian, who advocated the purchase of the patu, wanted it because he, too, was postulating migration and communication between Polynesians and the north-west coast of America. Wilson noted in the accession papers, These are the patu-patu which are said to be indiginous [sic] to that country... [and] If any one of these objects was indiginous [sic] to that country and made or used by its aborigines, it opens up the entire question of migration from Polynesia and the northwest coast . . . and if they shall be established as indiginos [sic] no scientist can lightly set aside the theory of migration or communication between the two countries until he shall have examined successfully and thoroughly the proposition proposed by these implements. If there is any evidence to be furnished by the similarity of industrial objects or weapons in two distant countries which would be satisfactory^] it seems to me these are. They obviously did not know (or chose to ignore) about the Cook-voyage connection to the patu. All of this ambiguity suggests that the 'ancient grave' provenance may have simply been an elaboration invented by Wickersham to add value to a rare object that would prove his theory (and to make his own collection of similar-style weapons more valuable). The attribution of the patu to a pre-European grave would establish its authenticity as an indigenous Native American object, thereby proving the theory of Wickersham and making it more valuable to Kunzie (who wanted to sell her collection for the enormous sum of $10,000 in the 1890s). This object is not indigenous; nevertheless the speculative theory that is embedded in its attribution to an 'ancient grave' is irrelevant to repatriation regulations. Journal of Museum Ethnography 1 7 (2005) 155</page><page sequence="5">Advienne L. Kaeppler Repatriation case-workers rule on a so-called 'preponderance of evidence' and on finding a 'cultural affiliation'. 'Affiliation' here relates to the last indigenous person who had 'possession or control'. Although Eric Hollinger (a member of the Smithsonian repatriation staff) notes in a 2003 paper, 'the determination of cultural affiliation can be one of the most complicated and potentially frustrating steps in the repatriation process', affiliation is usually attributed to the last American Indian thought to have owned it, in this case an Umatilla. Any other cultural associations are irrelevant, and reasonable doubt is not taken into consideration by repatriation law. For affiliation purposes, an object's life history is unimportant, and it does not matter if an object is of historical significance. According to repatriation rules, cultural affiliation is defined as shared group identity. From what I have recounted about the history of this patu, I do not see a 'shared group identity' with the Umatilla. It seems to me that more compelling cultural associations are with the New Zealand Maori (whose artefact-type it represents) and the Englishman Joseph Banks (who had it made). As an ethnologist, it seems that the repatriation of 'unassociated funerary remains' must be a continual dilemma for NAGPRA. In this case, if the patu did come from a grave, we do not have any specific information about it, and Kunzie and Wickersham give it two different localities. Further, if it was in a grave site, this does not mean that it was buried with a Native American. It could have been a grave of a European (which would have been possible), it could have been dropped in a grave site, indeed, it could have been used to dig a grave. If it were from a grave, it would have been because it was a possession of an individual (an individual of whom we have no knowledge). I do not see a shared group identity. When the Umatilla representatives visited the Smithsonian, they did not know what it was. Nevertheless, it is only the affiliation derived from an object's supposed funerary association that is recognized by repatriation legislation.3 It is known from historic records that such patu were not highly regarded by their Native American owners on the north-west coast. Colnett, who saw a patu in possession of a Tsimshian chief, concluded that 'it seemed to be of no great value among them' (Colnett 1787, cited in Burgess and Billick 2004). Meares recorded an incident in which a Nootka chief attempted to give three such patu back to the Europeans, but the Europeans gave them back again to the Nootka. Meares gave them back because he was against collecting anything from Native Americans except furs. He notes in a letter to Douglas, 'it is my particular desire, that not even a curiosity be purchased on the coast of America, and as few as possible at the Sandwich Islands, such an intercourse only tending to gratify an idle and vain whim, at the expense of the infant commerce now about to be established' (Meares 1790: appendix II). There is no physical evidence that this object was ever in a grave; if it had been, one might expect it to be physically altered from its nearly pristine state. Brass, however, does not corrode easily, and its condition is similar to other copper-alloy objects found in archaeological sites. Part of the inscription of the coat of arms is now illegible, but this is consistent with wear already noticed by Meares in the 1780s. Meares noted, 'On one of them [the three patu] the engraving was not so 156 Journal of Museum Ethnography 17 (2005)</page><page sequence="6">Two Polynesian repatriation enigmas at the Smithsonian Institution much injured as to prevent the whole of it from being very intelligible; on the others, the part of these distinct marks was worn out' (Meares 1790: 133). Not being able to read the inscription can be associated with use-wear rather than resulting from being in an archaeological site. It seems to me that important evidence that should be considered is the evidence of another collector trying to prove a theory by claiming that the patu was indigenous Native American. I am not convinced that it was a funerary object and, as it is not associated with human remains, there is no evidence that it was intentionally placed with a burial. (Although intentionality is a requirement in the definition of 'funerary objects', this is automatically inferred if there is a grave attribution - even for unassociated funerary objects.) There is also the possibility this object was associated with a trading or living site rather than a grave. Although burials of Native Americans in the area did include European goods, such as brass buttons, glass trade beads, tubular beads and pendants made from copper-based metal sheeting, and 'consisted largely of trade good used for purposes of ornamentation' (Phebus 1978: 142; Stapp 1984: 22), such things as patu are not part of a known 'death rite or ceremony of a culture' (as required in the legislation).4 Here is the enigma. Although the evidence does not show an association with a specific grave, or that it had been intentionally placed with a specific burial; and the information that it came from an Umatilla grave may have been invented to prove a theory, and the patu is of cultural and historical significance to many more people - the repatriation rules still require that it should be offered for repatriation, which it has been. I am hopeful that the Umatilla, after reading this additional information, will consider that there are doubts about the patu's attribution to a grave. More importantly, it is hoped that the Umatilla will recognize that this object, because of its multiple identities, is important to other cultures as well as the Umatilla. Its association with Captain Cook makes it a symbolic link between the English, the New Zealand Maori and the people of the north-west coast, and gives this patu important historic and cultural significance to the United States and to the wider world. Its arrival in the Pacific north-west marked the beginning of a time of dramatic change for the Umatilla and other tribes of the region, and makes reference to the era of exploration that, for better or for worse, transformed the world. Through this patu the Umatilla have an opportunity to tell the story of their own culture change, as well as of the impact of Cook's expeditions on the world. Hopefully, the Umatilla will not choose to rebury this important object, but instead will work with the Smithsonian in seeking alternatives that will preserve this object and continue to educate future generations about the culture and history associated with it and an intriguing story of eighteenth-century globalization, of which the Umatilla were a part. The physical remains of the Fijian 'VendovP (Veidovi) When Charles Wilkes set sail into the Pacific in 1838 he, like Cook before him, was looking for new discoveries - and he even made some. The stated purposes and Journal of Museum Ethnography 1 7 (2005) 157</page><page sequence="7">Adrienne L. Kaeppler vision of Wilkes and his patrons were surprisingly similar to those of Captain Cook - that is, to explore the South Polar Sea to find out if land or a continent existed there, to provide charts for safer navigation, to extend the boundaries of science and to promote trade. There was, however, a subtext: it was also meant to be an expedition for 'national glory'. The United States government, born in 1776, was 62 years young, and patriotic citizens were eager to have their country recognized as a naval power, as well as to show the scientific world that American science had come of age. The United States Exploring Expedition (US Ex Ex), as it was called, like the voyages of Cook, also succeeded - but unlike Cook's voyages, Wilkes and the accomplishments of his expedition are little known. The US Exploring Expedition of 1838^12 under Lt. Charles Wilkes was the first international hydrographie and scientific survey to be undertaken by the young US Government. It was also the last major expedition to be carried out under sail in wooden ships, and is often described as an expedition of 'iron men and wooden ships'. Expedition members surveyed 300 islands, drafted 200 maps and charts, mapped 800 miles of the Oregon coast, confirmed the existence of Antarctica as a continent and collected vast quantities of natural and cultural history specimens. At the time the Expedition returned there was no US National Museum and many of the objects went temporarily into the National Institute located at the US Patent Office.5 Human remains collected on the voyage made their way to the Army Medical Museum. One of the stories that connects the United States Exploring Expedition, the Army Medical Museum and, ultimately, the Smithsonian Institution is that of the Fijian Chief, Ratu (or Ro) Veidovi. Some years before the US Ex Ex, in 1834, a number of Americans from the ship Charles Doggett had been killed by Fijians after a deal had been negotiated for the people of the island of Kadavu to collect bêche- de-mer (a sea slug) and to provide a place for smoking it before it was taken to the markets of China. Apparently the workers were clubbed to death by the Fijians and cannibalism was suspected, and Chief Veidovi was implicated in this event. When Wilkes heard this story some six years later, he was determined to find the perpetrator and to render justice for the ten American sailors. Wilkes, aboard the flagship Vincennes, left orders for Captain Hudson, aboard the companion ship Peacock, to capture the leader responsible for these acts, who was suspected to be Chief Veidovi. When Veidovi was first met by members of the expedition, he wished to have his picture drawn by one of the expedition's artists. A. T. Agate depicted Veidovi in a side view (Figure 2) to illustrate his head, which 'was dressed in the most elaborate and extravagant fashion of Rewa' (Wilkes 1845: vol. 3, 120). Some days later, one of the Fijian Chiefs and his entourage were held hostage on the Peacock until the perpetrator, Veidovi, surrendered. A half-brother, Ngaraningiou, agreed to deliver Veidovi to Captain Hudson - at least partly to dispose of his hated rival. Veidovi confessed to the crime, and Wilkes had him transferred to the Vincennes, and decided to punish Veidovi by taking him to the US as a prisoner. At first Veidovi was allowed little freedom, but he was befriended by Benjamin Vanderford, one of the ship's mates, who spoke a Fijian language. Eventually 158 Journal of Museum Ethnography 17 (2005)</page><page sequence="8">Two Polynesian repatriation enigmas at the Smithsonian Institution Figure 2. 'Vendovi ' Woodcut by R. H. Pease from a sketch made by A. T. Agate (Wilkes 1845: vol. 3, 120). Veidovi received permission to move freely around the ship, and he soon became popular with the crew. When the ships arrived in what is now Pierce County, in Washington state, Veidovi took part in a parade on July 4, 1841, to celebrate America's independence, dressed in traditional Fijian style. (The explorers named Vendovi Island in Puget Sound in honor of the Fijian chief.) Unfortunately, his friend Vanderford died, and Veidovi fell into melancholy and developed a lingering cold. A few hours after the expedition arrived back in New York, Veidovi was taken to hospital, where he died. In the Naval Hospital a death mask was taken. The skull became part of their Medical Museum, and rest of the body was buried in the cemetery of the Naval Hospital (and subsequently moved to a Veterans Affairs Cemetery on Long Island [Cyprus Hill National Cemetery]). In 1862 Veidovi's skull came to the Smithsonian, with part of the Wilkes Collection, on the closing of the National Institute for the Promotion of Science, and then was transferred to the Army Medical Museum (located on the National Mall in Washington, DC) in 1869. In 1898 it was Journal of Museum Ethnography 1 7 (2005) 159</page><page sequence="9">Advienne L. Kaeppler transferred back to the Smithsonian, along with all of the anatomical physical anthropology collections of the Army Medical Museum. In 1978 T. Dale Stewart published a paper on Veidovi's skull, in which he examined it in relation to Melanesian and Polynesian physical anthropological studies. He concluded that the skull's 'cranial measurements tend to approach closer to the means of the Polynesian sample than to those of the Melanesian sample' (1978: 211) and that Veidovi's 'skull is Polynesian both in nose shape and head shape' (1978: 212). For several years Veidovi's skull was part of an exhibit on physical anthropology at the Smithsonian's Natural History Museum. This exhibition hall was organized by T. Dale Stewart, and Veidovi's skull was part of 'Section 4, Varieties of Modern Man', which illustrated that modern man originally came to the Pacific Islands from south-east Asia (Stewart 1971: 19). In the 1980s, Adi Lala Lady Mara, the Roko Tui Dreketi, and direct descendant of Chief Veidovi came to visit me at the Smithsonian. I told her about the skull of Veidovi, related its history to her, and took her to see the exhibition in which the skull appeared. Adi Lala was very interested in the story and in seeing the skull in the exhibition. I told her about the policy of the Anthropology Department, that if we have remains of a known or named individual, we offer these remains back to their lineal descendants. Adi Lala was not interested in having the skull returned to Fiji, and was happy to have it remain on exhibit. In 1989 an article about Veidovi appeared in the Inflight Magazine of Air Pacific. Picking up on this opportunity, the US State Department requested that Veidovi's remains be returned to Fiji as a political gesture of respect and friendship. In October of 1990 Adi Lala again visited the Smithsonian and met with the Director of the National Museum of Natural History, Dr Frank Talbot. She made no formal claim to have the skull returned to Fiji, and indicated that it was an honour to herself and the people of Fiji to have her ancestor, a great chief and historical personality of Fiji, present and curated by the United States National Museum. Again, in 1992, the US State Department, in conjunction with the Department of Defence, contacted the Anthropology Department and requested that the skull be turned over to them. There was, however, no formal letter of request from Lady Mara, nor from the representative tribal group, to indicate any knowledge of, or support for, the State Department's initiative. I telephoned Adi Lala, on vacation in London, and she requested that no action be taken until she returned to Fiji. No request has ever been made. Nevertheless, at the urging of the then Deputy Chair of the Department of Anthropology, the director of the museum agreed to give the skull to the State Department. Dr David Hunt and I met with the Fijian Ambassador and Dr William Rodriquez III (Chief Deputy Medical Examiner of Special Investigations, of the Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner), and the skull was turned over to them with the agreement that the postcranial remains would be disinterred from the cemetery in Long Island, so that his complete skeletal remains would be sent to Fiji. After some months, Dr Rodriguez's report noted that 'after lengthy investigations, including two excavations at the reported grave site of Figian [sic] 160 Journal of Museum Ethnography 17 (2005)</page><page sequence="10">Two Polynesian repatriation enigmas at the Smithsonian Institution Chief Vendovi, no postcranial remains were discovered. In view of the lack of postcranial remains the Figian [sic] government has instructed me on behalf of the US State Department to return the skull of Chief Vendovi to the collections at the Smithsonian' (letter dated 8 December 1993). Since 1993 Chief Veidovi's skull has again been living peacefully at the Smithsonian. Here is the enigma, and hopefully a lesson. Human skeletal remains have a wide variety of emotional and educational values, which differ from society to society. When a political group or a political entity, such as the State Department, want to use human remains to advance their agendas, this violates the cultural trust that anthropologists hope to create between native communities and museums. When a direct descendant of an individual does not think it is appropriate to repatriate human remains, we should listen to this individual and not try to advance a political agenda from the outside. Further, because of the well-publicised repatriation cases in the United States, the North American perspective on repatriation of human remains and cultural objects has come to be seen as 'universal'. This is unfortunate, as other cultures see museum collections and repatriation in quite different ways. Acknowledgements I wish to thank Jeremy Coote of the Pitt Rivers Museum for information on the manufacture of the brass patu; and Laurie Burgess, William Billeck and Eric Hollinger for background information on the archaeology of south-east Washington and north-east Oregon, and for helping me to understand the repatriation regulations. I also wish to thank David Hunt, collections manager for physical anthropology, for his meticulous records of the transactions associated with Vendovi. Notes 1 . Two are in the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford University; one is in the Museum of London; and one is in the British Museum, which at present is displayed in the 'Enlightenment' exhibition. 2. Eells does mention a war club that came from Umatilla Landing that was 22 inches long (Eells 1889: 288). This cannot be the patu, which is 14 inches long. 3. In the paper by Eric Hollinger on 'The logistics of determining cultural affiliations in the repatriation process', he implies that objects can have their own cultural affiliation, but only the last one is taken into consideration. According to NAGPRA, the cultural affiliation of an object is related to the human remains in a grave in which the object was found. In this case we do not know a specific grave, and there are no associated human remains, thus it is difficult for me to see that the patu is culturally affiliated with the Umatilla. We do know that it has cultural associations with the Maori and the English. A further question on cultural affiliation that would be of ethnographic interest: if Chief Sitting Bull's gun is found in an Iroquois grave, with whom is the cultural affiliation? Would Chief Sitting Bull's descendants insist on their cultural affiliation, in spite of what the Iroquois might claim?
