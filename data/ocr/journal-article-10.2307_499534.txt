<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SITE OF AKROPOTAMOS AND THE NEOLITHIC PERIOD OF MACEDONIA THE excavation at Akropotamos in the valley of Nea Pieria was conducted in the summer of 1938 by Washington University of St. Louis under the auspices of the Greek Archaeological Society and with the collaboration of Mr. George Bakalakis, ephor of antiquities of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace.' The valley of Nea Pieria, cut off from the rest of eastern Macedonia by the Pangaion mountains and from the sea by the long and low Symbolon range, remained unknown archaeologically until the summer of 1938. In the course of our exploration of eastern Macedonia during that summer we noted a number of mounds of prehistoric type in the valley of Nea Pieria and one of these we tested by excavation.2 It is located almost at the center of the valley and at the beginning of one of its many natural exits to the sea- coast. The site occupies the top of the hill of St. George, which is a very short dis- tance to the southwest of the modern village of Ak- ropotamos.3 The location, with its commanding posi- tion over the surrounding pasture land and its many springs, was ideal for the establishment of a prehis- toric center. The top of the hill, com- posed of two distinct ter- . . .. . . .. . MNi USEi FIG. 1.- THE MOUND OF AKROPOTAMOS races spreading gently on either side of its highest point, was occupied in neolithic times (fig. 1). In both terraces an undisturbed neolithic deposit was found im- mediately below the present surface of the soil, while a good many sherds were to be seen even before the excavation on the surface and slopes of the hill. The neolithic deposit of the north terrace was the deeper, averaging 95 cm. at its northeastern end. That of the southern terrace averaged 45 cm. in depth throughout its extent. Our efforts were naturally concentrated on the northern terrace, where a broad trench 3.50 m. in width and 20 m. in length was dug across its northeastern end. 1Cf. Praktika 1938, pp. 103-111. To Chancellor George R. Throop of Washington University, to Professor Eugene Tavenner and to the members of the Committee on the "Wulfing Fund" we wish to express our gratitude for the funds which made possible this work. It is needless to mention our indebt- edness to Mr. Bakalakis, whose energy and work have forcibly brought Eastern Macedonia to the attention of the scholarly world. 2 A second site, that of Polystylo in the plain of Philippi, was also investigated, but its contents and the final publication of the material from Akropotamos will be presented in a special study. For Poly- stylo, cf. Praktika 1938, pp. 109-111 and below, figures 6, 7-10 and 8, 4-5; 1N, 15-17. 3 Known until recently as Bobliani.

MYLONAS The results obtained in this trench were verified by three soundings, made on the eastern and western sides of the terrace. Four more trial pits, 2 x 2 min., were dug in different parts of the southern terrace. The only architectural remains uncovered in our trenches belong to a small clay structure, very badly preserved but apparently of rectangular shape, the clay walls of which were darkened with smoke and hardened with fire. Its exact nature could not be determined, but it seemed to us that it was part of a hearth, or of an oven, similar to those discovered by Tsountas at Dimini and Sesklo.4 The pottery discovered, however, is plentiful and consists entirely of sherds and in- cludes monochrome, incised and patterned wares. Of these the patterned wares are the most interesting and can be divided into five distinct varieties, differentiated by their color-scheme and their patterns. A. To the first variety belong sherds with an elaborate curvilinear and rectilinear decoration, painted in a black to brown color on the polished red surface of the clay (fig. 2, 1-7). Spirals, spiraliform, rhomboid and trapezoidal elements are especially used in the decoration of this ware, which is the characteristic patterned pottery of the northern terrace and which seems to have been produced in large quantities at the time when the settlement was abandoned. B. Pottery bearing a decoration applied in a black to brown color on a creamish- white ground will form our second variety (figs. 2, 8-10; 3, 5-7). The ground color was produced by a slip and the common elements of the decoration are spirals and especially arcs filled with solid color and placed in a zonal and metope-like ar- rangement. C. The third variety is made up of sherds which could be called "three-color ware." The curvilinear decoration of this variety is carried out in red, is outlined in black and is applied on a buff ground. A comparatively small amount of this ware was found at Akropotamos. D. Sherds with a curvilinear and spiral decoration painted in black color, often matt, on the red or buff ground of the vase, belong to our fourth variety (fig. 3, 8- 10). The fabric is coarse and the firing is often inadequate. The decoration is not so elaborate and as a rule is carried out in a careless way. E. The final variety includes sherds bearing rectilinear decoration as a rule and painted in a brilliant black to brown paint on a creamish-buff polished surface (fig. 3, 1-4). Technically, this is the best patterned ware produced at the site and it is the characteristic painted pottery of the lowest layer of the deposit in the north terrace, although it is represented by a few sherds in the finds from the surface level even. These five varieties of patterned ware from the site of Akropotamos present a rich assortment of decorative elements, some of which are known from other sites, others are new, and most are treated in a novel way. The rhomboids, for example, connected or forming the center of a decorative pattern, are among the older geometric ele- SAIt rpoicYroplKCaL KpoTr6XoEli Alypxviou KCxi a EaKovU, Athens, 1908, pp. 51, 60, 61, especially 90 and 104-106.

MYLONAS ments painted by the neolithic potters of Greece.' Usually they are hatched, but in many examples from Akropotamos we find them filled with solid color (fig. 4, 4-6). This delight in solid color is seen in another common pattern, the triangle suspended from its base and flanked by circles filled with solid color (fig. 2, 3). However, tri- angles with the interior hatched or lined are also common and apparently antedate those filled with color 6 (fig. 4, 3). An intermediary stage is represented in our figure 4, 2. The reverse of the solid painted circle, i.e. a circle or circular area reserved in the color of the clay, appears on sherds found in the surface layer (figs. 2, 6; 4, 11). Perhaps more interesting is the combination of two triangles connected at their apex, again filled with solid color (fig. 2, 2). The resulting pattern from this combination of triangular elements is interesting and resembles the so-called "butterfly" pattern which we find again on the mainland in the Middle Helladic Period and on matt- painted pottery. It seems that on the mainland we have the early elements from which the butterfly could have developed and perhaps we do not need to look to Crete for its origin.7 Spirals and spiraliform patterns are very common and on one sherd (fig. 5, 4) two spirals are attached to a common vertical stem, producing a pattern reminiscent of formalized plant patterns of a much later period I and of the spiral decoration found on a sherd from the neolithic settlement of Olynthos.' The ornaments discussed thus far are common to the first and fourth varieties of our patterned ware. The arc, arranged serially or alternately along a line, is exten- sively used for the decoration of our second variety. Although we find the concentric arc used occasionally, as we find it used occasionally on other mainland sites,1o as a rule, the arcs of our ware are filled with solid color and form a very pleasant (decora- tion (figs. 3, 5, 6; 4, 9, 10). Attention should be directed to pattern no. 2, figure 5, which recalls the egg and dart moulding and finds a parallel in the graphite decora- tion on a black-polished sherd from Olynthos.1i Also to the rectilinear patterns ex- hibited on the sherds of our fifth variety (figs. 3, 1-4; 5, 6-9) and especially to their lining and the pendant small lines which recall very strongly similar decorative I Dimini and Sesklo, pl. 7, 1-2; G.

A, following page 88) and on a sherd from Tsani Maghula of the same style (A3b, Prehistoric Thessaly, fig. 84, c, e). I Series of triangles filled with solid color, however, are not unusual in the earlier "red-on-light" ware, in which they are found usually along the inside of the rim: cf. Dimini and Sesklo pl. 7, 3b; Carl W. Blegen, Prosymna, Cambridge, 1937, ii, fig. 623, 1; Prehistoric Thessaly, fig. 97f and fig. 83a, where the triangles are painted in "white-on-red." 7Soteriades, op. cit., fig. 13. In Crete this pattern appears in the Early Minoan period: cf. Sir Arthur Evans, PM. i, fig. 926. It is to be noticed, however, that we have this pattern on neolithic vases from Chaeroneia, painted in the "red-on-white" style (Soteriades, op. cit., fig. 9 and Prehistoric Thessaly, fig. 1492a). Perhaps we have the same pattern in "red-on-white" on a sherd from Tsani Maghula, Prehistoric Thessaly, fig. 83, 1. 8 PM. iv, fig. 301; E. Pfuhl, MuZ. iii, figs. 105, 108, etc. 9 G. E.

MYLONAS elements found in the patterned ware of the Early Helladic Period.12 We have al- ready remarked that this ware was produced throughout the period during which the settlement was occupied and it seems that its decoration was being elaborated and developed in the long years of its life. Our stratigraphic evidence seems to indicate that its earlier years are marked by strictly rectilinear motifs (fig. 3, 1-4); its latest stage by the addition of spiral and spiraliform patterns, usually as pend- ants, to its rectilinear compositions (fig. 5, 8). We may note finally the "filling-in" ornament of figure 5, 3, as it recalls the X-shaped motif which appears in the same r6le in Middle Helladic and later times." The arrangement of these elements on the surface of the vases which they decorated cannot be definitely determined from our sherds, but they give the impression of belonging to compositions which lacked in continuity and were made up of different related and unrelated patterns placed side by side until the surface to be decorated was covered. This is especially true for our first, second and fourth varieties. Better organized compositions seem to characterize the ware of our fifth variety. The incised ware comes almost entirely from the northern terrace and the most characteristic belongs to small legged vases (fig. 6). The workmanship is crude, the pieces are badly fired and usually left in the color of the clay. Only one example presents a black-polished surface (fig. 6, 6). The ornament is made up of compara- tively few decorative elements: zigzags, parallel and angular lines and stamped circles on the angular corners of the body of the vase and on either side of the legs -an arrangement suggestive of an animal form. Compositions carried out both in color and in incision are very rare, but we have at least one good example of it, and this provides another parallel to an Olynthian specimen."4 Of the great quantity of monochrome ware - crude, plain, and burnished - the most interesting is the black-polished pottery found in abundance in the lower half meter of the deposit of the north terrace and in the filling of the south terrace. It is of excellent workmanship and presents a glassy black outer surface, which is some- times rippled. The color through the biscuit fades from black in its outer section to dark grey, to grey and to reddish brown in its inner section and often the inner surface of the ware is of various shades of grey and of reddish-brown color. The black color fades into red and a reddish-buff hue on the exterior face of certain vases with an angular shoulder, in a manner known from the black-polished ware of Olyn- thos.1 It should be noted that such black-polished ware was found in the lowest layer of both terraces, along with patterned ware of our fifth variety. With this ware should be included sherds which bear a decoration in graphite. Unfortunately, no complete vases were discovered, nor could any be pieced to- gether from the sherds found. But a good many of these sherds are so characteristic that they make possible the restoration of the most common shapes. Common shapes of the plain and coarse ware are deep bowls, similar to some found at Olynthos. Characteristic shapes of the patterned ware of our first and second varieties are very 12 Carl W.

The rims of these bowls are often thinner than the sides and rounded, but sometimes are flat and incurved (fig. 7, 1). Small lugs, mostly unperforated, are common on the sides of these bowls (fig. 7, 4); sometimes they are placed on the rim and then this is made flat and incurving. The decoration is commonly applied both on the exterior and interior surface of these bowls, but sometimes the interior decoration is limited to a broad band around the rim. Wide bowls on a high stand are peculiar to our second variety. Deeper bowls, 5 7 8 9 FIG. 7.-PROFILES OF AKROPOTAMOS VASES handled cups and jugs with or without handles (fig. 7, 3 and 6) are common to the first four varieties. Characteristic shapes of our fifth variety, with rectilinear decoration, are jugs with a short neck and flat ribbon handle starting a little below the neck and ending on the shoulder, below which the body bends in sharply towards the flat base (fig. 3, 3-4). The neck is offset from the rest, especially by painted parallel lines. Also smaller jugs, similar in shape to the above, but with flat ribbon handles starting from the rim and ending on the shoulder (fig. 3, !2) We must mention finally a miniature cup standing on a tall base which was found complete. The pottery found in the two terraces of our site seems to indicate that the southern terrace was occupied first and then the northern. The latter was abandoned while the first variety of our patterned ware was in its fullest development. The stone celts uncovered at Akropotamos are numerous (fig. 8, 7-11, 13, 14, 18,</page><page sequence="9">AKROPOTAMOS AND THE NEOLITHIC PERIOD OF MACEDONIA 565 20) and include examples of three types, B, F and BF, as distinguished at Olynthos and as established by Tsountas in Thessaly.16 It is to be noted that no example of type A, which we believe includes the earlier celts of the mainland, has been found at Akropotamos. Sample no. 11 apparently is half of a "split celt."'7 With the stone tools from the site we may mention a fragment of a marble bowl, found in the deposit of the north terrace. Three clay figurines were also found, none of which is entirely complete (fig. 8, 1-3). They exhibit, as usual, an incised linear decoration and at least one of them is steatopygous in nature. Nos. 1 and 3 belong to the standing type, no. 12 is of the seated variety. Two triangular lugs, placed high on the buttocks, would support the figurine in its sitting posture. The Akropotamos figurines are similar to those found at Dikeli Tash and at Olynthos.8 However, the clay representation of a human foot, illustrated in figure 8, 6, is unique as far as I know. It is covered with a curvilinear decoration in bright brown to black color, and has a suspension hole at the back of the heel. This suspension hole and the size of the object (about 3.5 cm. in extreme length) would indicate that it was perhaps used as an amulet. Such amulets in the shape of the human form or parts of it are very rare in the Neolithic Period. Pend- ants, perhaps amulets, of stone, clay and bone (especially of boars' teeth) are very common,19 but they are not in the shape of the human body or parts of it and the only other anthropomorphic amulet thus far uncovered is a stone figurine, 4.3 cm. in height, perforated at the waist, from the settlement of Sesklo in Thessaly.20 On the other hand, such amulets in the shape of a human foot were very common in the Early Helladic Period.21 Whether there is any relation between the Early Helladic and the Neolithic amulets in the form of a human foot cannot be determined at present, but the similarity is worth noting. Objects made of bone include a number of pins, needles, borers, polishers and a few pieces of wild boars' teeth, perforated for suspension. They could be illustrated very well by similar material which was found at Olynthos.22 A quantity of bones 16 Dimini and Sesklo, pp. 307-319; Prehistoric Thessaly, pp. 923-24; G. E.

Representations of human heads in clay or stone were found in Thes- saly, of course, but they were to be inserted in torsos made of a different material, are not perforated for suspension and as far as we know were not used as amulets: cf. Prehistoric Thessaly, fig. Q5. A stone figur- ine, 4.7 cm. in length as preserved, perforated at the waist for suspension, was found at Malthi, but it is not certain whether it was used as an amulet or as a cult figure (Valmin, op. cit., p. 339 and pl. I, 2). 21 Such amulets are known from Haghios Kosmas, Zygouries, Koumasa, Palaikastro, Haghia Triada, Platanos and Marathokephalon; C. W. Blegen, Zygouries, 1928, p. 197 and pl. XX, 3; G. E.

MYLONAS belonging to small animals, apparently goats, sheep and swine, were also found in the deposits examined. Remains of a settlement, belonging perhaps to the fourth century B.C., and of its cemetery were found on the western slope of the hill and beyond it to the northwest, and the ruins of a Byzantine church dedicated to St. George were partially cleared on its eastern slope,23 but no remains of any kind later than the Neolithic Period were found on the two terraces which form the top of the hill. This proves that the top of the hill of St. George was abandoned either at the end of the Neolithic Period or sometime during its progress and that since then it was never re-inhabited. Our exploratory excavation on and around the hill of St. George of Akropotamos revealed remains belonging to the 14th century, perhaps, of our era, to the fourth century B.C. and to the Neolithic Period. Of these the neolithic remains, so briefly and tentatively outlined above, are the most important, because they add consider- ably to our knowledge of prehistoric Macedonia and because they have opened up to investigation another section of that district. Until the summer of 1938 only one site of eastern Macedonia, that of Dikeli Tash, and another of western Thrace, that of Komotini, were tested by excavation, but unfortunately their finds remain un- published.24 To place the neolithic remains of Akropotamos in their rightful place we must compare them first with similar finds from other mainland sites. It has perhaps be- come apparent from the description of the patterned pottery that it presents close similarities to Thessalian wares of the Second Neolithic Period and especially to the varieties known as "Dimini Wares." Our first and second groups can cer- tainly be placed under the B3aU2 and the B3a3 Thessalian varieties, and the use of a creamish-white slip in the B3a3 group and in our second variety is striking. The three-colored ware finds a parallel in the B3y from Thessaly.25 Our fifth variety, with the rectilinear patterns, cannot be exactly equated with any single Thessalian group, but it exhibits characteristics common to the B38 wares. In both the patterns are "linear, comprising triangles, belts of parallel lines in zigzags, and wavy lines," and the jugs with handles seem to be common to both. (Our jug could be compared with one from Tsangli).26 The matt quality of the color, usual in Thessalian ware, is not to be found in that from Akropotamos and the broad painted bands of Tsangli are not used by our potters. The group of parallel lines arranged in angular zigzags, characteristic of our ware, could be compared with similar patterns of the B33 variety and of the earlier A3a and A3b wares.27 The filling in of the space between two paral- 23 Praktika, 1938, pp. 106-109. 24 Cf.

Perhaps it will be further substantiated when this type of pottery from Akropotamos is studied more completely. The parallel lines or dots which are suspended from the line painted around the neck of the jugs, and which recall so strongly a similar arrangement on Early Helladic patterned wares, could have developed perhaps from a wavy line similar to that seen on the Tsangli jug, or even from the toothed (or flame) patterns characteristic to the A3b wares.29 The decora- tive elements exhibited in the other four varieties are similar to what is found on Dimini pottery and their arrangement seems to correspond to the haphazard group- ing of patterns so aptly analyzed by Professor Wace.0 A We should further note that the open bowl with lugs and a flat or ringed base is the characteristic shape in both areas. The black-polished ware of Akropotamos corresponds to the black wares from Thessaly, where its existence goes back to the First Neolithic Period 31 and the angu- lar profiles of this ware are to be seen in the bowls from Larissa, published by Grund- man.32 The characteristic shape of the incised ware from Akropotamos is that of a small legged vase and of course such vases are known from Thessaly. It is perhaps interesting to note that in Thessaly such small legged vases were in use in the First Neolithic Period, but all the earlier examples are either undecorated or are covered with a painted decoration. The known examples belonging to the period of the "Di- mini ware" are covered with an incised decoration."&lt; Even so, all the Akropotamos examples which were found with the patterned ware of our first and second varieties, especially, which are very close to the "Dimini wares," are covered with an incised decoration. The figurines from Akropotamos, with their flat torsos and slovenly workmanship, correspond to those found in Thessaly and belonging to the Second Neolithic Period.34 The celts of both areas are almost identical; only the Thessalian 28 Prehistoric Thessaly, pl.

Perhaps we can see the beginning of this type of accessory decoration in A3b sherds from Tsani Maghula (Prehistoric Thessaly, fig. 85, a) and in the solid triangles arranged along the rim of A3b bowls. The use of internal parallel lines filling in linear patterns on the wares of the Dimini varieties is too well known to require special references, but we should like to draw attention to the sherds illustrated by Tsountas in Dimini and Sesklo, pl. 26, 4 and to his pls. 25, 4; 28, 2 and 29, 7, where a group of parallel lines is used as accessory decoration. 30 "Thessaly and Tripolje," ESA. ix, p. 125. 31 Prehistoric Thessaly, p. 15. 32 AM. lvii, 1932, Beilage XXIV.

Their small size and capacity will, of course, equate them with the Thessalian examples, which seem to be of quadrangular shapes and supported on four legs. At Olynthos both the triangular and quadrangular shapes are represented: Olynthus i, figs. 62 and 63 and p. 41. 3 Especially cf. Dimini and Sesklo, pls. 34, 35, 36.

MYLONAS celt type A 11 is not represented at Akropotamos. The fragment of a marble bowl from the Macedonian site finds its parallel in the example from Larissa discovered by Grundman.36 Unfortunately we have no architectural remains at Akropotamos which we could compare with those found in Thessaly, but we have already noted that the fragmentary clay structure at our site is similar to examples used as hearths or ovens at Dimini and Sesklo and that on those sites some of the simpler houses have en- tirely disappeared and their existence is indicated only by the remains of their hearths. This may be the situation at Akropotamos also, where only the remains of what seems to be a hearth have been found thus far. We believe that our discussion has brought forward the strong affinities which exist between the remains uncovered at Akropotamos and those known from Thessaly. Of course, parallels are available from the neolithic area to the south of Thessaly, but we believe that for the present the Thessalian affinities will be sufficient to place our site among the neolithic sites of the mainland of Greece. The affinities of the site of Akropotamos with other Macedonian sites must now be examined. Our description of the remains from Akropotamos has already dis- closed the close similarities existing between them and the discoveries made at the site of Olynthos by Professor Robinson. The black-polished pottery, with its tendency to become multicolored, and its grey inner surface; the black-polished ware with graph- ite decoration; the black-on-red patterned ware with spiraliform elements (our varieties A and D); the small legged vases with incised decoration and the miniature cup find good parallels in various specimens discovered at Olynthos.31 The shapes of the coarse, plain, incised and patterned wares and the many vases with handles present similarities equally strong.38 Our clay figurines with flat torsos and incised decoration are paralleled by an Olynthian example, and the celts from Akropotamos correspond very closely to those found at Olynthos.31 The quality of the foundations of Olynthian houses could be taken to illustrate the ephemeral character of the Akropotamos structures.4" The similarities noticed in every cultural phase leave no doubt that the two sites belong to the same general neolithic group, and lead to the conclusion that the culture represented at Olynthos is now found beyond the Strymon river to the east. The black-polished ware from Polystylo and its patterned and incised varieties seem to indicate that even in the plain of Philippi traces exist of that culture, the limits of which will be determined only by additional excavations. Consequently, the conclusion reached by Heurtley in his recent book that "the country east of the Struma is differently orientated and goes rather with Bulgaria" seems now to be premature.4 The site of Haghios Mamas has been proved by Heurtley to be related to Olynthos and consequently it will be related to our site also. We must notice, however, that at Haghios Mamas some "white-on-black" ware was found and this is unknown to 35 Dimini and Sesklo, p. 312 and figs. 238 and 239. 36 Op. cit., Beilage XXII. 37Mylonas, Olynthus i, pl.

Kritsana ware, however, seems to be nearer than any other neolithic painted ware to the characteristic "white-on- black" pottery of Vardina,44 which can be placed at the very end of the series of our neolithic Macedonian pottery. This tentative conclusion is strengthened by the stratigraphy obtained at the two sites. Kritsana ware was found with Early Bronze Age remains and the same seems to be true at Vardina.45 In fact only recently has the neolithic character of the pottery from that site been recognized, not because of the evidence obtained at Vardina, but because of the similarities presented by its pottery to its neolithic predecessors. The black-polished pottery will form the bond which connects the sites of Akro- potamos and of Servia in the Haliakmon Valley. The site of Servia is the most im- portant neolithic site excavated thus far in western Macedonia and on its remains Heurtley has based his conclusions about the origin of the neolithic culture of that part of Macedonia which lies to the west of the Strymon,46 but which must now be extended even to that part which stretches to the east of the river. At Servia both the First and the Second Neolithic Periods of the Mainland are represented. The remains of Akropotamos have no affinities with those belonging to the First Period and must be compared only with the finds from the Second. The black-polished ware is to be found on both sites, but the beaded and grooved varieties of Servia ware are unknown at Akropotamos. In the few patterned sherds represented in Heurtley's figures 15 and 16, and apparently related to the Dimini ware of Thessaly, we may find parallels for our first and fourth varieties. However, the "grey-on-grey" ware and the incised ware with designs made by "'discontinuous strokes and stabs,''47 which are characteristic of the second period at Servia, are not to be found at the site of Akropotamos. The same is true of the "varnished ware," which at Servia presumably was produced during the closing years of the Neolithic Period. It should also be noted that the "white-on-black" style which is found at Servia is entirely lacking at Akropotamos, while the jugs with the rectilinear patterns characteristic of the latter are not to be found in the former. From the point of view of decorative elements and fabric the fifth variety of patterned ware from Akropotamos could be 42 BSA. xxix, 1927-19928, pp. 118-155; Prehistoric Macedonia, pp. 1-8, 109, 157-158. 4 Prehistoric Macedonia, p. 109 and pp. 17-22, 158-161. l Heurtley, op. cit., p. 70, believes that the "Vardina curvilinear style is paralleled by the dark-on- red painted style of Kritsana" and that "the two techniques were in fact interchangeable at will." I cannot follow him in this statement and from the material published in his book this cannot be proved. For the time being and until I have a chance to see the material from the sites concerned once more, I can only accept the statement made above. Heurtley, however, goes further, on p. 110, and includes the pottery of Olynthos in his parallels, without mentioning his evidence for this equation; I find it impossible to accept this conclusion. 45 Ibid., p. 35. In the diagram on the same page the E. B. Age is not indicated, nor are its remains, with the exception of a copper pin, included in his catalogue. 46 Ibid., pp. 43-56, 135-151. 7 Ibid., figs. 8-10.</page><page sequence="14">570 GEORGE E. MYLONAS compared with the Servia "grey-on-grey"; the excellent technical quality, the strictly rectilinear and rather orderly decoration, the bands of zigzags, are common elements to both and even the "lining," which is so characteristic of the Akropo- tamos variety, is to be found at least on one sherd of Servia ware.48 Such decorative elements, however, are to be found in the earlier "red-on-white" and "white-on- red" wares and their appearance at Akropotamos and at Servia may indicate only a derivation from a common source. The difference in shapes and color-scheme will make the equation of these two wares very difficult, if not impossible. On the other hand, the characteristic incised ware of Akropotamos does not find a parallel at Servia and the "waisted celts" so typical of the latter site are not in evidence at the former. A comparison of the remains available from the two sites has proved, we believe, that important differences exist between them. These differences become more sig- nificant because of the similarities which the remains of Akropotamos present to those from Olynthos and from Thessaly. The similarities noted between the Akro- potamos and Olynthos finds indicate that the two sites belong to the same general neolithic culture. Heurtley has maintained that Olynthos, as well as all the sites of Macedonia, are "offshoots of Servia" and that their culture is directly derived from that of Servia.49 If we follow his conclusion, we must accept Akropotamos as another center established by the roving settlers from Servia. But then how can we account for the cultural differences noticed between the two sites? To explain the differences existing between the remains of Servia and those of the sites of the Chalcidice espe- cially, Heurtley has maintained that the late neolithic culture at Servia exhibits "two phases." The first of these is represented only at Servia and includes whatever has not been found on other Macedonian sites, i.e., the "grey-on-grey" and the pe- culiar incised ware of Servia which are characterized by "an absence of bases and of handles." The second "phase" was brought about by the development of various "local styles" in each of the many settlements of Macedonia, "offshoots of Servia." These styles, "differing from place to place," are "all ultimately dependent on aesthetic conceptions which the first settlers at Servia brought with them," and are characterized by "curvilinear decoration, the development of bases and handles and of new forms." At Servia itself in this second phase we find "a simple painted style, varnish instead of polished slip, angular profiles and curvilinear incised orna- ments." 99 This convenient explanation must now be stretched to cover the remains of Akropotamos, since they are related to those from Olynthos. We doubt that Heurtley's theory explains the differences existing between the wares of Servia and the rest of neolithic Macedonia. But even if we assumed that it did explain these differences and consequently the differences existing between the Servia and the Akropotamos remains, how could we account for the similarities existing between the finds from our site and those from the Thessalian sites of the second period? Heurtley refuses to accept any influence of Thessalian II wares on the later neolithic pottery of Servia and consequently we cannot derive the Thessalian affinities through Servia. It will indeed be strange to accept the theory that the potters of Akropotamos, though coming from Servia, abandoned the types with which they 48 Heurtley, op. cit., fig. 10a. 49 Ibid., pp. 77, 109, 128. 50 Ibid., p. 77.</page><page sequence="15">AKROPOTAMOS AND THE NEOLITHIC PERIOD OF MACEDONIA 571 were familiar at their home-site and developed a "local style" which is so different from the Servia style, but so similar to Thessalian! Heurtley has attributed the similarities existing between Thessaly and Macedonia to the "inherent Danubian tendencies" of the Danubian people who settled Servia first and then moved from there in two directions, to the south to Thessaly and to the east to central Mace- donia and the Chalcidice.S1 The settlers who came to Thessaly, finding in that dis- trict a flourishing production of patterned ware, recalled their Danubian traditions and adding its elements to those existing, brought about the Dimini style.52 But the settlers who moved to the east did not find such a culture in the areas in which they established themselves and one is justified in wondering what brought about the re-appearance of the "inherent Danubian tendencies" which lay dormant for such a long time and which were never revived at Servia, the focal point of this wide expan- sion, although the potters of that site are represented as constantly experimenting and discovering new varieties of ware. And, again, how could these artistic elements be remembered by later generations who were brought up in a different ceramic tradition which was in progress during the first phase of the Second Neolithic Period, the length of which is undetermined, but which has to be long enough to account for the development of so many varieties of wares at Servia? 61 Since they took with them into Thessaly their "grey-on-grey" ware, why did they not do the same when they moved to the east? It seems to me that potters who continued to produce the traditional black-polished pottery would naturally continue to produce the "grey- on-grey" patterned ware, rather than invent a "dark-on-red" style. We may further note another rather strange phenomenon. At Akropotamos these supposed settlers, equipped with "inherent Danubian tendencies," developed a painted pottery which is very similar to that which in Thessaly resulted from the combination of elements existing in that district in early neolithic times and of others brought by supposed Danubian settlers from Servia.54 And yet at Akropotamos we do not find the earlier Thessalian elements which play an important r6le in the creation and development of the later patterned ware. Regardless of all these problems which are raised by Heurt- ley's theory of origins and which seem to find no answer in it, it seems to me that any such theory must first be established on definite evidence, rather than on abstract "inherent traditions" and on prehistoric "aesthetic conceptions." If we turn to the evidence on which was based the division into two phases of the Late Neolithic Period of Macedonia we shall find that the existing evidence does not 51 Heurtley, op. cit., pp. 116-117. 52 The spiral in the Dimini ware could perhaps be attributed to the influence of these Danubian settlers (cf. A. J. B. Wace, op. cit., p. 197). 53 It should be noted that at Olynthos, at least, these settlers lived for awhile before they started pro- ducing their painted ware and this will make even longer the period during which the Danubian tend- encies lay dormant. For the experiments and successes of the Servia potters, cf. Prehistoric Macedonia, pp. 67-70. Heurtley suggests (p. 127) that the first phase lasted for only fifty years, but this is a guess, as he admits, not based on any evidence. 54 Cf. A. J. B. Wace, op. cit., p. 127. The motives of the earlier neolithic ware "all in a way foreshadow the patterns of Dimini except for the spiral." It should also be noticed that the supposed settlers from Servia stopped making celts of the "waisted" type when they came into the Chalcidice, while their relatives in the home-site continued to produce them even in the Early Bronze Age (cf. Prehistoric Macedonia, p. 86).</page><page sequence="16">5792 GEORGE E. MYLONAS justify such a division." Usually a division of that kind must be based on the evi- dence obtained from the remains of many sites and certainly of well-stratified sites. In the case of Macedonia the division was derived from only one site, from Servia, and from its uncertain stratification. The late neolithic filling at Servia averaged 1.30 m. in depth and of this "the upper part contained also Early Bronze pottery." Which part of this filling belongs to the first and which to the second phase is not indicated, nor how deep was the "upper part." The level of the occupation imme- diately following the destruction of the early neolithic settlement, the depth of which remains unknown, "was disturbed and not very productive" in the series of pits marked by the letter "F." Apparently the level was disturbed in the series of pits marked by the letter "D," since the "stratigraphic equation between the two series of pits (F, D) was close." This was followed by the "level of the last occupa- tion" which "lay close to the surface." How deep this level was is not specified, but we must remember that "Early Bronze Age people were also present on the mound" and that, consequently, their remains must be included in this level, since it lies close to the surface. Besides, the surface level does not seem to have been undisturbed, because the "varnished ware, plain or with incised ornament, is found in the surface metre, and though the stratification is confused, it must belong to a rather later phase of the Late Neolithic Age." 56 I doubt that this stratigraphic evidence can support any division of the period into phases, and any such division must await further evidence. We must note briefly another problem presented by the Macedonian "white-on- black" ware, which was produced at Servia, but was not found at Akropotamos. This patterned ware is especially represented at the site of Vardina and its curvilin- ear style is considered by Heurtley as the counterpart of the "dark-on-red" ware from Kritsana and from Olynthos. According to him, "the two techniques were in fact interchangeable at will," because one sherd from Saratse bears on the outside a "white-on-black" and on the inside a "dark-on-red" decoration." In connection with this statement, which will transform the "white-on-black" ware into the bond which binds together the painted pottery of neolithic Macedonia, we may advance the following remarks. 1). Kritsana is a later site than Olynthos, established perhaps after the site of Olynthos was abandoned by its neolithic inhabitants. Consequently, any similarities existing between its pottery and that of Vardina will not be con- clusive evidence for the wares from Olynthos. 2). The sherd from Saratse may indi- cate that the two techniques were interchangeable at some time, but that time may or may not be in the Neolithic Period. This sherd was found either in "an unstrati- fied context," or on the "surface" (it is not stated which) in a site where "no neo- lithic occupation was discovered . . . the earliest Bronze Age settlements lying in every case immediately above the virgin soil." 58 This may indicate that the tech- 11 It seems as if whatever is not found on the other Macedonian sites but is common at Servia is con- sidered characteristic of the first phase, and whatever is left over is placed in the second. 56 The stratigraphic evidence for Servia is taken from Prehistoric Macedonia, pp. 43-55. 17 Op. cit., pp. 70, 75, 110. It is to be noted that Heurtley begins with Kritsana and Vardina ware and later (110) includes Olynthos in his equation. 58 Op. cit., p. 929. It should also be noted that Heurtley has concluded (p. 110) that the earliest settlement of Saratse was later than the first Early Bronze Age settlement at Kritsana; consequently,</page><page sequence="17">AKROPOTAMOS AND THE NEOLITHIC PERIOD OF MACEDONIA 573 niques were interchangeable, but not in the Neolithic Period. 3). The position of the "white-on-black" pottery in the series of Macedonian neolithic wares is not as yet established. We have noted that such ware was not found at Olynthos, or at Akropo- tamos. It was found at Haghios Mamas, at Servia and at Vardina.A9 At Haghios Mamas eleven pieces were discovered, but their relative position in the filling was not indicated in the publication of the site, and it is uncertain whether they were found in purely neolithic, or in a mixed context, or in the deposit formed at the time when the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age people lived together in the same village. Furthermore, such ware was found in the Early Bronze Age filling.60 No arguments could be based on the rectilinear character of the decoration, because this is found with curvilinear at Vardina. The small size of the sherds representing this pottery will make it impossible to distinguish an earlier and a later phase in its development by means of shapes.61 This evidence is paralleled at Servia, where the Early Bronze Age and the Late Neolithic Period overlap and where, furthermore, the stratigraphy is not certain but seems to be confused. Our only real evidence for this ware comes from Vardina, where it was found in great quantity. On that site vases with "curved outlines," as well as vases "with angular profiles," were found decorated with curvilinear or rectilinear elements, or with a combination of both.62 This seems to indicate that these shapes and decorative elements were used contemporaneously and from the evidence (stratigraphic and otherwise) obtained at Vardina it will be impossible to determine a progressive de- velopment of the one from the other. The earliest stratum at Vardina, in which this ware was found, belonged to the Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages. What part of it belonged to each of these ages is left undetermined, but a copper pin discovered at the site is stated to belong to the "latter half of the (Early Bronze) period." From this we can infer that the site was still inhabited in the "second half," as it was in the first half, of the Early Bronze Age. The date of this age for Central Macedonia is not definitely fixed, but Heurtley believes that its beginning must "be placed nearer ?2500 than 2000" and its end before 1700 B.c. At any rate, it seems certain that it had a fairly long life. This should be represented by a deposit of some depth. But the first stratum has a depth of only 1.50 m., it belongs both to the Neolithic and the Early Bronze Ages, and furthermore, it "seems to represent the debris of a the distance between the first settlement of Saratse and the last settlement at Olynthos becomes con- siderably greater. The Early Bronze Age villages are placed in the following chronological sequence: Kritsana; later Haghios Mamas and Molyvopyrgho; even later Saratse and Kilindir. 59 In this discussion we consider only the sites which were scientifically explored. For such sherds from Sedes, cf. L. Rey, "Observations sur les premieres habitats de la Macedoine," BCH xli-xliii, 1917-1919, ii, pl. XIII, 4, 8, 11. These should be compared with the incised sherds from the same site, ibid., pl. XIII, 1 2, 3. It could be suggested that the "white-on-black" technique was developed when the neolithic makers of the black-polished wares came into contact with the Early Bronze Age producers of incised ware and resulted from a combination of the elements of the two wares. Certainly the incised decoration after some use of the ware could suggest the white paint, and it is remarkable that such "white-on-black" has been found thus far in settlements in which the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age cultures overlap. 60 BSA. xxix, 1927-1928, pp. 122-130, 1392, fig. 8, 10; Prehistoric Macedonia, p. 83. 61 Most of the sherds seem to belong to rims and naturally they will not indicate the character of other structural parts: whether, for instance, the vases had a rounded or flat bottom, etc. 62 Prehistoric Macedonia, p. 70.</page><page sequence="18">574 GEORGE E. MYLONAS single settlement." 63 These considerations can lead only to one conclusion, that the neolithic remains discovered at Vardina must be almost contemporary with its Early Bronze Age remains, and consequently the "white-on-black" ware from Vardina must be placed at the end of the Neolithic Period and at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. To this evidence from Vardina we may now add: A). That the ware thus far has been found on sites on which the Neolithic Period and the Early Bronze Age over- lapped (i.e., at Servia and at Haghios Mamas besides Vardina) and in an undeter- mined relationship to the other wares. B). That at Haghios Mamas, at least, it was produced even in the Early Bronze Age. C). That the ware was not found in purely Neolithic sites, such as those of Olynthos and of Akropotamos, one of which, at least, was accepted by Heurtley as belonging to the culture represented by the finds of Haghios Mamas, and the other, excavated after Heurtley's work was completed, proved so by its affinities to Olynthos. Consequently, we believe that, at least for the time being, the position of this "white-on-black" ware must remain undetermined and until its position in the series of Macedonian ware is fixed, no conclusions can be based on this ware. Our discussion of the differences existing between the remains of Akropotamnos and those of Servia has resulted, we believe, in the two following general conclusions: A). For the time being these differences cannot be explained adequately. B). The theory of the origin of the Macedonian Neolithic culture propounded by Heurtley cannot ex- plain these differences, nor can it be proved correct by the evidence available to date. More sites with undisturbed stratification must be excavated fully in Mace- donia before any general conclusions of relationships and origins can be drawn.64 Our comparison of the finds from Akropotamos with those from other Macedonian sites has indicated their strong affinities and leads us to maintain that our site be- longs to the same general neolithic culture which is represented by the remains of the sites of the Chalcidice especially. The affinities of Akropotamos and the Thessalian sites have also been noted. Their explanation, however, is delegated to the future, when more sites in Macedonia will have been excavated and when, as it is hoped, the Macedonian Neolithic culture will be better known. Again, the comparison of our finds with those from sites beyond Macedonia will not be attempted, since at the 63 Ibid., p. 70, for shapes and decorative elements; p. 33 for a discussion of Vardina's stratigraphy; p. 88 for the copper pin; pp. 126-127 for the chronology. It should be noted that the depth of the fill- ing of the Late Bronze Age at Vardina amounts to 3.50 m. and represents a length of time of about 450 years. The deposit of 1.50 m. of the first stratum would have required approximately 200 years to form on the basis of the later evidence. These 200 years will represent the Early Bronze Age and the Neolithic Period together and this, considering the chronological limits accepted for the former, will be explained only by the overlapping of these two periods and cultures. Of course, figuring out dates and length of occupations by means of the depth of the filling is not a scientific and a correct procedure, but it is used here only for the suggestion which it carries. 4 Neolithic remains are known from other Macedonian sites: from Aivatli (BSA. xxiii, 1918-1919, pp. 13-15); Goumenitsa (Rey, op. cit., ii, pl. II, 6); Kapoutzides (Rey, op. cit., i. pp. 91-6); Sedes (Rey, op. cit., p. 201); Karaman (BSA. xxvi, 1923-1925, pp. 36-37); Armenoehori (Prehistoric Macedonia, p. 151 and also pp. 151-157); (cf. G. E. Mylonas, 'H VEOl01Ku -trwoX v 'EAA~St. pp. 92-101). But since a good many of them are chance finds and the rest were discovered in excavations conducted by military authorities, their evidence is doubtful and cannot be depended upon, at least in the present stage of our knowledge of prehistoric Macedonia.</page><page sequence="19">AKROPOTAMOS AND THE NEOLITHIC PERIOD OF MACEDONIA 575 present stage of our knowledge such comparisons will scarcely result in definite conclusions.65 It remains now to consider the date of the settlement of Akropotamos. The re- mains of our site can be placed only within very broad chronological limits. There is no doubt that the settlement on the hill of St. George near the modern village of Akropotamos belongs to the Neolithic Period. The similarities noticed between its pottery, especially, and the Thessalian wares of the Dimini varieties, should place our site within the limits of the Second Neolithic Period of Greece.66 On the other hand, its affinities with the Olynthian remains will indicate that the two sites are roughly contemporary.67 No Early Bronze Age remains were found at Akropotamos and it is not certain whether the site was abandoned at the end of the Neolithic Pe- riod or during its progress. Consequently, the evidence obtained at our site cannot help to solve the problem of the length of the Neolithic Period of Macedonia and, as a matter of fact, no such evidence is obtainable from any other excavated site. No Bronze Age remains were found at Olynthos and it could be assumed at will that the site was or was not abandoned before the period actually came to a close.6" At Hag- hios Mamas the neolithic remains were followed by those of the Bronze Age, but it remains uncertain whether the beginning of the neolithic deposit of that site marks the beginning of the Neolithic Period in the Chalcidice, whether its settlement antedates that of Olynthos, or is much later. Heurtley, indeed, has maintained that the settling of Haghios Mamas preceded that of Olynthos, because at "Haghios Ma- mas a few sherds recall the Early Neolithic Thessalian" style.69 I do not think that this evidence is conclusive and the comparative depth of the deposits of the two sites, 65 I should like to explain the Thessalian affinities as indicating the direction from which the new elements of the Dimini culture were derived, but having already indulged too much and perhaps un- successfully in the speculative field of ethnographic and cultural derivations I have come to realize that our knowledge is too limited for such excursions. I subscribe fully to the statement made recently by Professor Wace: "When the archaeology of the Greek Mainland in the Neolithic Age is much better known than at present, then we might venture to comparisons with the culture of its neighbors" (op. cit., p. 132). For comparisons of Macedonian and Danubian finds, cf. the very pertinent remarks of Heurtley in Prehistoric Macedonia, p. 114, and his imposing list of common elements in the two dis- tricts (pp. 114-117). 66 Cf. Dimini and Sesklo, pp. 361-366; Prehistoric Thessaly, pp. 9235-9239; Wace, "Thessaly and Tripolje," ESA. ix, p. 131; MvXAcovs, op. cit., pp. 151-153; H. D. Hansen, Early Civilization in Thessaly, pp. 75-76. 67 Olynthus i, pp. 95-96. 68 Heurtley, op. cit., p. 10, note 1, states: "At the time of excavation Dr. Mylonas showed me a few E. B. sherds, which, if I remember rightly, he said were found at the top of the Neolithic deposit." On this recollection partly he bases his conclusions of the length of the Neolithic Period of the Chal- cidice. However, I never showed Mr. Heurtley any Early Bronze Age sherds from Olynthos. If such were found, and had been identified by Heurtley as his statement implies, I would have included them in the final publication of the neolithic remains of that site. The lack of such material forced me to put forward the suggestion stated in my book Olynthus i, p. 97. 69 Prehistoric Macedonia, p. 109. A comparison of the depth of the filling of the two sites should be very instructive. The filling at Olynthus averaged 1.90 m. in depth and was purely neolithic; the filling at Haghios Mamas averaged only 1 meter in depth. And then Heurtley on p. 109 uses the stratification of Olynthos to determine the order of the foundation of the settlements in the Chalcidice. If Haghios Mamas is the earlier site, its stratification must determine the serial sequence. There is no way even to know whether the evidence as to the patterned ware obtained on these two sites agrees. It should be remembered that Haghios Mamas is a very large site, that it has been tested only by Heurtley and that it should be thoroughly excavated before any final claims for its contribution to our knowledge of neolithic Macedonia are made.</page><page sequence="20">576 GEORGE E. MYLONAS the existence of the "white-on-black" ware and the undetermined appearance of the patterned wares at Haghios Mamas, on the one hand, and on the other, the lack of any Bronze Age remains at Olynthos, seem to indicate that the opposite is true, that the site of Olynthos was settled first and then that of Haghios Mamas. The settle- ment of Servia is the only other site which offers any indication as to the length of the Neolithic Period in the Haliakmon valley, because there the neolithic remains are succeeded by those of the Early Bronze Age. However, its evidence must be cor- roborated by evidence from other sites before it can be stretched to cover a district so complex as that of Macedonia; especially since Heurtley's theory of the derivation of the neolithic culture of Macedonia from that of Servia does not seem to agree with the facts as known to date.70 Heurtley has suggested that the Neolithic Period of Macedonia was a very short one, because the neolithic deposits of its sites, with the exception of Olynthos, are thin.7" This may be so, but before this suggestion is accepted as a fact, it must be established that a good many, if not all, the neolithic deposits of Macedonia are shallow. That this may not be the case is indicated by the deposit of the site of Polystylo in the valley of Philippi, which has a depth of two to four meters.72 We may, therefore, conclude that the length of the Neolithic Period of Macedonia cannot as yet be determined and place with all due reserve its phase, illustrated by the remains of Olynthos, Haghios Mamas and Akropotamos, within the chronological limits of the Second Neolithic Period of the Mainland. This very broad and tentative conclusion perhaps is not so very satisfactory, but it is imposed by the paucity of the material evidence which has been uncovered thus far. More sites must be excavated thoroughly, both in Macedonia and in the neigh- boring regions, before we can hope to have a conclusive picture of Macedonia of the Neolithic Period and of its racial and cultural relations and affinities. Meanwhile, the work at Akropotamos has added one more neolithic site to the very few explored thus far, has opened up a new district to research, has helped, we hope, to place the study of the Neolithic Period of Macedonia on a sounder basis, and has added sub- stantially to the material on which ultimately will rest our definite knowledge of the prehistory of that important section of the Hellenic world. GEORGE E. MYLONAS WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, SAINT Louis 70 It should be noted that at Servia the First Neolithic Period is also represented. Whether this pe- riod will be found to be represented in other Macedonian sites of course cannot be determined before- hand. Heurtley believes that Servia alone was inhabited in that period, but patterned sherds of the "red-on-white" style were also found at Aivatli (BSA. xxiii, 1918-1919, p. 15. Cf. Prehistoric Mace- donia, p. 64 and p. 75, note 1, where an effort is made to place them in the Late Neolithic Period, al- though "technically these sherds might be Early Neolithic") and at Sedes (Rey, op. cit., ii, p. 201; cf. also MuAcovaS, op. cit., pp. 93-94). 71 Prehistoric Macedonia, p. 1927. It should be noted that until 1938 only three neolithic sites in Mace- donia were excavated: Olynthos, Haghios Mamas and Servia. 72 Mylonas-Bakalakis, Praktika 1938, p. 110.</page></plain_text>
