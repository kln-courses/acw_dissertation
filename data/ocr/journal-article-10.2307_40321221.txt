<plain_text><page sequence="1">Response T. L. SHORT Abstract: This response to my seven critics is organized under five topics: 1. The books scope and approach; 2. Physicalism, idealism, anthro- pomorphism; 3. Final causation; 4. Peirces development; 5. Signs, objects, interpretan ts. No ground is ceded, but I have found the interchange clarifying and hope that the reader will find it so, too. Keywords: C.S. Peircey Semeioticy Teleology, Intentionality, Naturalism. I thank my critics for their generous praise and for their invariably interesting and use- ful criticisms. One advantage of having so many critics is that there is more criticism than I can answer in this space, giving me an excuse to choose those remarks that I can respond to most effectively. My failure to respond to one or another objection made by one or another critic should not be taken to imply either denial of its importance or (Heaven forefend) agreement with it. Another advantage is that I can cite one critic in answer to another, since they agree with one another no more than they agree with me. They are of one mind that I have gone wrong, but of different minds about where I have gone wrong. But I will not avail myself of this latter advantage, as I like to say things myself. Rather than respond to each author seriatim, I will address seriatim some of the topics they have raised. Some- times, the same topic was raised in different ways by different authors. /. The Book's Scope and Approach Some authors complain of my omitting or scanting one or another item of importance. It would be easy to confess that the title of the book is at fault, as Bergman suggests, for &amp;e TRANSACTIONS OF THE CHARLES S. PEIRCE SOCIETY Vol. 43, No. 4 ©2007 ,,- 663 ,,-</page><page sequence="2">t/3 promising a more "inclusive" treatment of Peirces theory of signs than I ¿h provide. No one volume could cover every aspect of that theory. But that O easy way out risks veiling a fundamental issue. For I do claim to have pre- •- ' sented Peirce s theory, or rather one possible reconstruction of it, in its f""1 fundamentals, albeit not in all its ramifications. What I take to be rami- ^ fications, Bergman, Liszka, and perhaps others take to be fundamental. ^ Bergman cites a text in which Peirce says that we should begin with ^ human communication and abstract the concept of sign from it: that ^~j would seem to mandate an approach opposite to that which I have fol- */J lowed. Liszka rightly insists on the primacy of rhetoric in Peirces view of , semeiotic, and that might seem also to support the view that we should begin with human communication. I certainly agree that human thought, inquiry, and communication are the places where the theory of signs becomes most interesting, com- plicated, and potentially illuminating. Even on my own view, that is what it is all for. After all, the major theme of the book is that Peirce's semeiotic provides a naturalistic but non-reductive account of human mentality in all its dimensions. And yet I have begun with and have stressed the most primitive, ergo, non-human, forms of sign-interpre- tation, namely, non-conscious yet end-directed animal responses to stimuli. It is almost as if I were pushing a crude behaviorism. Why this perversity? Might there be some method in my madness? Before addressing that issue, I must point out respects in which the book is more comprehensive than some of my critics seem to think. After much laying of groundwork, I offer definitions, in Ch.6, of "interpretation", "sign", and "significance" (in that order: the order is crucial), not exactly in Peirces words but as my best shot at formulating concepts he formulated again and again, in different ways, and never to his own final satisfaction. I was careful, or tried to be, to make those definitions broad enough to cover the wide spectrum of signs, signifi- cance, and interpretation that Peirce's theory covers, including not only animal behavior but also scientific inquiry, moral judgment, and works of art. That breadth is explicitly claimed, and I should think that such phenomena as communication, political debate, and art criticism are included by implication. Naturally, there was not room to develop all of those topics. However, in the concluding three chapters, I discuss some aspects of the application of this theory to human language and its uses, to thought and mind, and to scientific inquiry. Art and moral judg- ment are touched upon here and there in passing, and especially with reference to what Peirce called "emotional interpretants." Indeed, a the- sis I advance is that emotional interpretants, by virtue of their being interpretants, are subject to correction much as "logical" (i.e., intellec- tual) interpretants are, and, hence, that objectivity is as much a feature of moral judgment and art criticism as it is of scientific inquiry. I am therefore at a loss to account for Pape r s assertion that my idea of phi- 664 r</page><page sequence="3">losophy "boils down" to an understanding of semeiosis and the human ^ mind "only insofar as it functions in the search for knowledge" and that ^ I neglect "practical, moral reasoning," etc. It might be germane in this § connection to note that, in Ch.12, I argue that Peirces philosophy of n science, though it anticipated Quines "naturalized epistemology," is * superior to the latter precisely in respect to recognizing that the cogni- H tive values that inform science are themselves subject to change (as, his- P1 torically, they have changed) and that some such changes can be &lt;£&gt; defended as objectively right. The natural sciences would not be objec- o tive if some judgments of value could not be made objectively. h Liszkas complaint is easier to understand. He is right that Peirce made semeiotic to embrace critic (or logic as that is usually understood today: the study of valid inference) and rhetoric, as well as grammar (or the study of signs themselves). Furthermore, it follows both from Peirce's pragmatism and from his holism (not a term he himself employed) that, of these three departments of semeiotic, rhetoric should occupy the primary position, without reference to which noth- ing in critic or grammar can be understood. For sign-interpretation and inference occur in a context, which is the use these processes have; we cannot understand what those processes are, without reference to their use. And the study of the use of signs is rhetoric. But one of the oddi- ties of Peirce's writings on signs is that he says (or seems to say) little about rhetoric, other than that it is important. Outside of those writ- ings, he treats one department of rhetoric - that concerning how best to inquire, or methodeutic - extensively. His economics of research, his ethics of terminology, his definition of science as a communal enter- prise vanquishing egotism, and much else belong to methodeutic. "For- mal rhetoric," Liszka says, "was concerned primarily with the practice of inquiry itself." But, as Ch.12 and much of Ch.10 are devoted to exactly that topic, it is odd that Liszka complains that "Short deals lit- tle with it." Now, I must confess that, when I wrote the book, I had not thought the matter through in quite the way that I am now thinking it through in response to Liszka. So here is what I now think I should have said then, but didn't. Within Peirce s semeiotic writings, it is his complex the- ory of the interpretant that is his rhetoric. The interpretant is the effect of a sign qua sign; it is the use, or the beginning of the use, that inter- preters make of signs; and, in the case of those signs that are produced purposefully, that is, in order to signify, the interpretant the sign is intended to produce is precisely that to which rhetoric in its classical sense (doubtless narrower than Peirces concept) applies. Pragmatism - in semeiotic terms, the doctrine that habit-changes are the ultimate form of intellectual interpretants - is part of Peirces rhetorical theory. If all of that is correct, then Peirce did treat rhetoric extensively in his semeiotic writings and in other writings. And the book I have perpetrated is ,,-</page><page sequence="4">c/3 almost entirely concerned with rhetoric. For, in it, I identify significance Z with potential interpretation (more exactly, with grounded inter- O pretability or what Peirce named the "immediate interpretan t"), where ►-1 interpretation is always for some purpose. (Max Fisch expressed the È""1 same view when he said that the key concept of semeiotic is not that of ^ sign but is that of semeiosis, that is, the action of signs, viz., their inter- ^ pretation: Fisch 1986, Ch.17.) And thus my discussion of the grammar ^ of signs is limited primarily to but two chapters out of twelve - those, ^ Chs.8 and 9, on sign taxonomy. The rest is rhetorical theory. I wish I had *j said so. r I have no similar regret as to critic. For I said clearly and, I think, reasonably, that I would not discuss Peirce s accounts of abduction and the other forms of inference, since his contributions to those topics have already been extensively examined in the literature. Most obvi- ously, his elaborate contributions to the formal logic of deductive infer- ence could not have been discussed in a book already overburdened. Those contributions, too, have an extensive secondary literature, though still inadequate: Putnam 1990, Ch.18 and Sowa 2007 show that Peirce s importance to the development of modern logic has been vastly underrated. But that was not my topic, with one exception. The theory of signs depends on Peirce s phaneroscopy, which depends on his algebra of relations. And therefore I do discuss the algebra of relations, Pape to the contrary, though only so far as is necessary to my purpose. Let us return, then, to the question whether concepts adequate to the analysis of human communication should have occupied a larger and more fundamental place in my narrative. Peirce said that we should abstract or generalize from the signs most familiar to us. But abstract what features? Generalize how far? That depends on what it is that we want semeiotic to explain. Synechism is Peirces doctrine that human mentality is continuous with the rest of nature; it is the denial of Carte- sian dualism. I have taken his theory of signs to bear a large part of the argument of his Synechism. Now, if we took all signs to be ones pro- duced in acts of communication, wherein one agent intends to produce an interpretative response in another agent, then semeiotic phenomena would extend but little way down the animal kingdom, and medical symptoms, clues, evidence, and all the various stimuli to which animals respond could not be counted as signs. And then semeiotic would not help us to explain how capacities for communication developed in the first place: it would include nothing simpler out of which those higher functions could have developed. The generalization must therefore go very far from the production and interpretation of signs in communi- cation; it must go at least as far as I have taken it (others, the biosemi- oticians, think it should be taken further yet). But should my text have reproduced that process of generalization? gg, Aristotle distinguished the path of discovery from the path of knowl-</page><page sequence="5">edge (systematic exposition). To begin with human communication ff and generalize from there is, in semeiotic, the first path; that path is ^ presupposed by the second, which I have taken. I have worked from the 3 bottom up, systematically. I see no reason why I should have tried also n to reproduce Peirces path of discovery. * H 2. Physicalismy Idealism, Anthropomorphism P The preceding two paragraphs are not enough to dispense with &lt;g Bergmans objection. For they pertain only to generalization. There's o still a question whether I have abstracted more drastically than Peirce h intended. Even with respect to natural signs, such as symptoms and stimuli, he may have retained some of the features lesser minds suppose are unique to human communication. Ransdell, not in this symposium but in other writings (1976, 1977), has argued that Peirces conception of a signs object (that which it signifies) is abstracted from the idea of a speaker, one who utters words. The object is the utterer, generalized. But in what sense do objects "utter" the signs that signify them? Rans- dell does not suggest that every object is a conscious agent who utters signs intentionally. But he does maintain that all signs are produced in order to be interpreted. How so? Surely a disease does not produce symptoms in order to draw attention to itself. Ransdell and I agree in a ideological reading of Peirces semeiotic, but I limit purposefulness to sign-interpretation and do not agree that sign-production is in every instance end-directed. I have cited Ransdell in order to illustrate the question of anthropomorphism that Bergman has raised. The question is not only whether one should be anthropomorphic but is also: how far should anthropomorphism be taken? As to the primary question, whether 'tis nobler in the mind to be anthropomorphic, Bergman quotes a passage in which Peirce s anthro- pomorphism appears as a rejection of Kant's affirmation of "things in themselves," beyond human ken. If that is what anthropomorphism is, then it provides no guide to inquiry; for inquiry is limited a fortiori to what we can know. Another possibility, however, is one that I mention somewhere in the book, though not calling it anthropomorphism, viz., that Peirce resuscitated the Presocratic doctrine that "like is known by like." For, on that view, whatever we know bears some resemblance to the knowledge we harbor of it. Knower and known have a common ontology. For example, in Peirces view, our knowledge of laws of nature consists, ultimately, in the habits of action and expectation in which our symbolic representations of those laws are interpretable. And habits, like laws of nature, are conditional in nature, subjunctively and counterfactually (or, as Peirce was wont to say, they entail "would- be's"). So, in terms of Peirces phaneroscopic categories, ontologically interpreted, laws and our knowledge of them are both 3rds. And, simi- larly, lsts are known by lsts and 2nds by 2nds. But, as this doctrine is ,.</page><page sequence="6">oo also meant to apply universally, it, too, provides no guide to inquiry. It Z does not tell us to be anthropomorphic in some respect in which we O could fail to be anthropomorphic. A third possibility is that it is in the |- ' interest of Synechism that we are to proceed anthropomorphically, r""1 namely, by reading as much as possible of human mentality into nonhu- ^ man nature. That is a guide to inquiry, but one difficult to follow safely. ^ We are back to the question, how far may we go, anthropomorphically? ^ Go too far, and you start talking nonsense, attributing thought and ^ purpose to inanimate objects and mechanical processes. Go not far /} enough, and you divorce thought and purpose from nature, precluding r their naturalistic explanation. Peirce s strategy, it seems to me, is the one just illustrated with respect to our knowledge of law. The strategy is to find something very abstract - indeed, a category of relation or rela- tional category - common to mind on the one hand and to nature on the other. Then we can see how, despite their very great difference, (a) mind may have emerged from unthinking nature and (b) the physical world may be known. Human thought is something new in the world, not found among chimpanzees, much less paramecia or spiraling neb- ulae, and yet it is but a special complication of 3rdness, and 3rdness has been an aspect of reality from the beginning. (Objectives (a) and (b) are what in the Preface I claim are the aims of Peirce s semeiotic; they are discussed most in my concluding Chapters 11 and 12, respectively, although the specific theme of explaining what Brentano called "inten- tionality," which I take to be essential to any adequate philosophy of mind, runs through the first six chapters.) Now, Peirce typically expressed these abstract commonalities in mentalistic terms. For example, at one time, in the 1890s, he attributed to nature a universal tendency to become increasingly orderly or law- governed, and he described that in terms that we normally apply only to animals, as a tendency to form habits. He went further, naming it the Law of Mind. Still not satisfied, he called himself an idealist, though qualifying his idealism as "objective" - a qualification that should be pondered more than it has been. (Earlier, he had been an idealist in other senses, initially Kantian.) That is a rhetorical strategy that served to startle his audience, challenging their Cartesian preconception of matter and mind as utterly different. However, as well as being benefi- cially leading, it was disastrously misleading. It has misled many into thinking that Peirce was attributing more of human mentality to nature than he really was, horrifying sober-minded philosophers and over- exciting some of his disciples. I therefore distinguish that rhetorical strategy from his genuine anthropomorphism, and in the book and elsewhere I have adopted the opposite rhetorical strategy of eschewing mentalistic language when not talking about human minds. Bergman is right that I am eager to evade charges of excessive or bad anthropomor- g,g phism and, I would add, to free Peirce from those charges. That is mis-</page><page sequence="7">leading in its own way: it has misled some of my critics, e.g., Pape, into £&gt; thinking that I have rejected Peirce's idealism and espoused a retrograde ►£ physicalism. p Pape understates the importance I accord to a theory of final causal- ° ity: it does not merely "strengthen" Peirce s semeiotic, it is essential to it. • (In the book, Ch.3, 1 , 1 explain why Peirce s architectonic ordering of the H sciences, in which semeiotic precedes metaphysics, is consistent with the P assertion that a metaphysics is essential to semeiotic.) I argue that all sig- j£&gt; nificance is relative to potential interpretation and that all interpretation o is purposeful, that is, directed toward achieving an outcome of some h type. In cases of pure theory or pure art, that outcome is an interpretant that is also a sign; in other cases, the purpose is extra-semeiotical. The purposefiilness of interpretation accounts for the significance of that which is interpretable. In particular, as that which has a purpose may fail its purpose, the purposefiilness of interpretation accounts for the possi- bility that what is signified is not. Because what is signified might not be, significance exemplifies Brentanos idea of intentionality, which he defined as having an "inexistent object," i.e., an object that is an object independently of its existing. Brentano asserted that intentionality is unique to human mentality, but the argument of the book is that sign- interpretation occurs independently of conscious thought and, hence, that Peirce s semeiotic applies to phenomena well beyond human men- tality. Thus it provides for a naturalistic explanation of the mind. But that is possible only if purposefiilness can occur without consciousness. Peirce s doctrine of final causation c.1902 provides a defense of that assumption. For it identifies final causation with selection for types of possible outcome, regardless of whether that selection is conscious. And it does so consistently with modern physics and biology. But more on that in the next section. Now, if final causation were limited to human purposefiilness, then sign-interpretation would be exclusively a function of human mental- ity, and sign theory would not be a vehicle for a naturalistic explanation of mind. I therefore reject utterly Pape s assertion that "An account of final causation and teleology that does not give special attention to the way in which human beings pursue ends and purposes, is seriously defective." On the contrary, such an account would sink the project, as well as being inconsistent with Peirce s own account of final causation. To construct a theory of final causation tailored to the special case of humanity and then apply that theory to all animate life (or, worse yet, as some have done, to plant life, cell life, and cosmology) would be anthropomorphism in the worst sense. Because I am not guilty of gross anthropomorphism, Pape asserts that I attempt to make Peirce's semeiotic consistent with "physicalism in contemporary philosophy of science." I think his idea of contempo- rary philosophy of science is inaccurate; for he later asserts that it could ^ ,~</page><page sequence="8">c/D not accept Peirces pragmatic and social theory of knowledge, whereas, Z in fact, at least since Stephen Toulmin and Thomas Kuhn have written, O if not well before, there has been a great deal of discussion along exactly •- ' those lines. But, yes, many contemporary philosophers, and not only I""1 those who make science their topic, are physicalists in this sense: they ^ think that everything that exists is physical, that the physical is that ^ which obeys the laws of physics (whatever those laws may turn out to ^ be), and that all phenomena are therefore explicable by physics (even if ^ it is often convenient or illuminating to employ other kinds of expla- /} nation, e.g., functional explanations or historical narratives). Now, it r seems to me that Peirce was clearly a physicalist in a sense limited to the first two- thirds of physicalism as just defined. He never asserted the existence of anything not physical,1 or that did not obey the laws of physics, although, far ahead of his time, he supposed that Newton's laws might not apply absolutely, but leave room for chance occurrences, and that other laws, e.g., the Second Law of thermodynamics, are themselves no more than probabilistic. (Surely he would have wel- comed the quantum revolution had he known of it.) But he was not a physicalist in the remaining third of the above definition. Peirce was explicit in his c.1902 account of final causation that, while final causation is unintelligible apart from efficient, i.e., mechan- ical, causation and while nothing that occurs violates such mechanistic laws as do apply, so far as they apply, there nevertheless are aspects of physical processes - processes consisting of physical events that obey the laws of physics - that cannot be explained mechanistically, namely, tendencies that are irreversible or nearly so. The claim is that the expla- nation of such tendencies cannot be reduced to mechanistic explana- tion, i.e., to explanation by the laws of physics. As that is what I maintain, at great length, in the book, it seems to me that I am not guilty of attempting to show that Peirces philosophy is consistent with contemporary physicalism. My aim is not to show that Peirce antici- pated currently fashionable views but, rather, it is to show that con- temporary philosophers still have a great deal to learn from him. Pape, citing an article of 1892, refers to Peirces "idealistic double- aspect theory of the relation of matter and mind." "Double-aspect the- ory" seems to me to fit well the view that I have just said, in the preceding paragraph, that I maintain in the book and attribute to Peirce. The human mind is continuous with those aspects of the phys- ical world that cannot be explained mechanistically. But, as the aspects are double, this theory is not idealism simplicitei. It is, in Peirce s phrase, objective idealism. And yet, Pape is right that I do in the book reject Peirces 1890s for- mulation of this double-aspect theory (though at first he says that I ignore it). The reason I do is two-fold: I do not understand it and Peirce , 70 himself appears to have dropped it. The Law of Mind, that habits tend</page><page sequence="9">to be adopted and to spread in inanimate nature, seems to me unintel- ^ ligible at the cosmological level at which it is meant to be applied. (It is ^o illustrated well by Peirce's examples of crystal growth and streams dig- s ging their beds deeper, but these illustrations presuppose physical laws a and do not explain them.) Peirce brilliantly remarked that the laws of * physics are themselves what most need explaining; but the Law of H Mind seems to me just as mysterious, and one does not solve one mys- P tery by adducing another. In any case, Peirce himself shifted ground &lt;£&gt; later, when he stopped talking about the Law of Mind and wrote in o some detail, though still fragmentarily, about final causation. Final cau- h sation is not a general law of habit-taking and therefore it is not a ver- sion of the Law of Mind. (Peirce said that the mind works by final causation. However, in his view, there is no law of final causation. It is precisely in that way that he distinguished final from efficient causa- tion: the latter is a process defined by its conformity to a law; the for- mer is a process defined by its tendency toward a type of outcome.) Now, it is true that Peirce attempted also to account by final causa- tion for the evolution of law in the universe, a revision of his cosmology of the 1890s. But, persuasive as I find his doctrine of final causation in other employments, I can make no sense of it cosmologically, even on Peirce's own grounds. For his account of final causation is statistical, and statistical explanation presupposes some sort of order, e.g., mecha- nistic, in terms of which we can determine which types of possible out- come are equi-probable, or that in some other way provides statistical reasoning the traction it needs. Pape complains that "Short refuses to consider Peirce's evolutionary cosmology in any serious way and denies its rational cogency." But denying its cogency, if done on the basis of reasons, such as those I have given, is taking it seriously! I do not deny it without argument. By the same token, I reject Papes claim (n.7) that I object to the project of cos- mology in general. Far from it; I am eager to be taught a cosmology that makes sense. I accept completely Peirce's reasons for cosmological spec- ulation and do not deny that some of his speculations may prove in the hands of others to be fecund. Only, I wish not to affirm a speculation that, so far as I can tell, remains persistently airy. 3. Final Causation Liszka ably sketches the breadth of Peirce's teleology and suggests its statistical foundation. He faults me, he says, for not developing that foundation in more detail, especially with reference to the central limit theorem. No doubt he's right (though I do cite Reynolds 2002, which covers that and other relevant matter). However, the central limit theo- rem does not do the whole job by itself and is, I think, of diminishing importance as we ascend teleology's hierarchy. The subject is vexed by changes in Peirce's terminology and the incompleteness of his remarks. .</page><page sequence="10">t/3 At one time, he distinguished "finious" processes from those genuinely Z teleological, but later he seems to have forgotten that distinction. My O treatment of the subject is therefore marked, some might say marred, •- ■ by imposing an order on it that is not wholly justified by Peircean texts. t""1 I shall reproduce that order here, as a framework in which to respond ^ to Liszka and others. ^ The central limit theorem, represented in the famous bell curve, ^ explains forms of order that result directly from a large set or long series ^ of chance occurrences. As Peirce once remarked, disorder is the simplest *J form of order, and that accounts for what might otherwise seem a para- r dox, that entropie disorder is the highly probable, almost inevitable, all- but-irreversible outcome of chance events, on the molecular scale, in systems that are closed thermodynamically. But that tendency toward uniform distribution - say, of gas molecules in an enclosed volume, or of molecules of one liquid stirred into another liquid, or of heat in a gas, liquid, or solid - is what Peirce thought was less than teleological. It was "finious" in the sense of tending, all-but-irreversibly, toward a final type of outcome. But it was very far from the kinds of order that Aristotle had in mind when he used the language that has been translated as "final cause." Far from being a direct consequence of large numbers of chance events, forms of organic order, for example, or of economic/social/polit- ical/moral order, are not inherently probable; they are inherently improbable. Chance, alone, and the central limit theorem do not explain them. Also, they are not final; they are fleeting. (Being fleeting is not the same as being reversible, since decay, death, and destruction are not growth reversed; the process is different and does not bring an organism or a society back to an earlier state, e.g., of infancy.) The importance of finious processes - for Peirces purpose as I understand it - is that their explanation is the first instance of a form of explanation that is not mechanistic. That explanation is so unexcep- tionable, and so obviously consistent with mechanistic laws, which, indeed, it presupposes, that it has usually been supposed to be mecha- nistic. Such is the power of the mechanicalist prejudice. However, one of Peirces most important discoveries is that the explanation of the Sec- ond Law of thermodynamics belongs to a class of statistical, non-mech- anistic explanations which include also Darwin's explanation by natural selection and teleological explanations. These are three quite different kinds of explanation, but they are alike in explaining processes that are irreversible or nearly so (call these processes anisotropic) and in doing so without invoking any law of anisotropy. Instead of by law, anisotropic processes are explained by the types of outcome toward which they tend. That is what makes those explanations non-mecha- nistic, however much mechanistic laws, deterministic or indeterminis- tic, governing the material parts, may be presupposed. 672</page><page sequence="11">There is of course a form of statistical explanation that is mechanis- &amp; tic in the covering-law sense (albeit not all mechanicalists would agree ^ that the covering-law extrapolation retains the key idea of mechanism); 3 Peirce himself contributed to its theory. In such explanations, phenom- n ena are brought under laws that are probabilistic: they are explained by * calculating their probabilities. Quantum mechanics provides the best H illustration, though post-Peircean. The use of the Second Law in statis- P tical mechanics is another example; I mean the use of that law in expla- &lt;*&gt; nation. But the statistical explanation of ùi&amp;t law is different. Here I o must correct Pape, who confuses the use of the Second Law in statisti- h cal explanations of one kind with that same law's explanation, which is statistical in the other sense. The set of equi-probable possible changes of distribution, either of molecules or of random molecular kinetic energies, that would consti- tute a change toward greater entropy, or, at least, not toward less entropy, is, for any sizeable population of molecules in a thermody- namically closed system, vastly more numerous than is its complement, the set of changes that would be toward less entropy. That is so, whether or not the mechanics of individual molecular motions is deter- ministic. In statistical explanations of this kind, the laws assumed do not have to be probabilistic (indeed, initially, the laws were assumed to be Newtonian and deterministic; only later was statistical mechanics reformulated consistently with quantum indeterminacy). The mathe- matics is sophisticated but the gist, very roughly, is that no-loss-of- entropy is a macro-outcome that is a type of micro-outcomes. Because that type includes a preponderance of equi-probable micro-possibili- ties, entropy-growth is all-but-irreversible. That is not a mechanistic explanation, since it is not a law of mechanics that explains the ten- dency. However, in these cases, the types of outcome that explain the tendency do not control the process. The process is finious but not tele- ological. It is a direct product of chance. The case of natural selection is different. It presupposes organic life (a thermodynamically open system) and the mechanisms of reproduc- tion and inheritance of characteristics. The ruling tautology in this case is not the central limit theorem but is the fact that inheritable variations in organic form that confer a reproductive advantage are likely to occur in subsequent generations in increasing proportion relative to less advantageous alternatives. Thus, over time, there is selection of variants for advantageous types of organic form. For example, if greater fleetness of foot would be advantageous to leopards and if a genetic variant leop- ard exists that is fleeter because its legs are longer, then there will be selection, in that population, 0/that alíele, that is, of a genetic disposi- tion toward longer legs. But it is crucial to recognize that the selection is for fleetness. Fleetness is distinct from long legs, since fleetness might 673</page><page sequence="12">c/3 have been increased by other means instead, had the right mutations Z occurred. Fleetness is what is selected-for, long legs is what is selected. O Fleetness is a type of possibility that, under those conditions, explains 1-1 why a gene for longer legs is selected. Here again, the type selected-for È""1 does not control the process and, so, we do not speak of organic evolu- ^ tion as an end-directed or purposeful or teleological process. However, ^ we do say that the features selected exist for a purpose, namely that type ^ of outcome for which they were selected. ^~j Chance occurrences still drive the process, but the forms of organic ^ order that result are not a direct product of chance, via the central limit r theorem. And that is why they are not inherently probable but, rather, are almost infinitely improbable. Specific adaptations cannot be predicted. Among organic features selected for one or another purpose, there are mechanisms that control animal behavior. We therefore say that such behavior has a purpose, namely, that type of outcome for which the mechanisms that control it were selected. It has that purpose whether or not it results in it or even is likely to result in it. However, not all behavior that has a purpose is behavior that we would describe as purposeful. To be purposeful, the behavior must be governed, i.e., be subject to alteration, according to its purpose. Now, in animals, there are mechanisms that vary behavior when it fails to be accompanied by outcomes of a given type, and reduce variation in the presence of such outcomes. Here, we may say that the purpose actually controls the behavior, to some degree. And thus we speak of purposeful behavior, or of acting for a purpose, and not simply of an action's having a purpose. Teleological explanation is explanation in terms of purposes for which an individual (including an individual society, herd, etc.) acts. Con- sciousness is not assumed in all instances of teleological explanation. However, laws of mechanical action do not themselves explain the ten- dency of purposeful behavior toward results of a given type. Such behavior depends on the unpredictable opportunities that chance affords, and its tendency is to be explained by the type for which there is selection, whatever the mechanics of selection may be. Teleological explanation therefore does not reduce to mechanistic explanation. An account of the mechanics of selection is additional to it. Teleological explanation does not follow from the central limit the- orem. Yet, the explanation is still statistical, because chance is still a major factor. Purposeful action is opportunistic and therefore the spe- cific actions taken by one acting purposefully cannot be predicted. The purpose for which an action is performed determines a tendency only. My point is that we cannot reduce all forms of non-mechanistic sta- tistical explanation to a single mathematical principle. But all forms are inherently more intelligible than are mechanistic explanations, just because each depends on one or another statistical tautology. Hence 674</page><page sequence="13">Peirces cosmological interest in explaining mechanistic laws statisti- £J cally, as Maxwell and others had explained the Second Law of classical ¿o thermodynamics statistically. But desire is not always accomplishment. 3 Liszka notes two other cases that this general account of finious n and/or ideological processes must cover. One is the formation of # organic order ab initio. Natural selection is of no help there, as it pre- H supposes organic order and especially reproduction. Stuart Kaufman, P whom Liszka cites, is of course but one of several scientists in the general &lt;s&gt; field of complexity theory who are attempting to account for life's ori- o gins. All agree that life is a thermodynamically open system, as organ- h isms sustain themselves by taking in matter and energy from the environment and (in thermodynamic terms) degrading it: they maintain their low entropy by driving up entropy in their environment, sustain- ing order by creating disorder. But how does it get started? I am more cautious now than I was in earlier writings, including the book under discussion, to describe, in terms that I understand how to apply to more settled forms of explanation, explanations that are still aborning.2 The other case Liszka cites is human self-control. Here we encounter conscious purposefulness, which depends on advanced forms of semeio- sis. One describes or diagrams possibilities and, in light of laws of nature represented in symbols, calculates their likely consequences if actualized. Thus one chooses courses of action that seem best to fit one s purposes. Pape thinks I neglect this topic, but in fact I devote much space to it (Ch.5,7, Ch.l 1,5). Among other things, I attempt to show how human purposefulness has an organic origin, without its being invariably subor- dinate to biological ends - survival preeminently. That is to my mind the weakest part of the book, as it is merely speculative and not very original. But at least it shows how a non-reductive naturalism might be possible. However it happened, the mechanisms of control of behavior that were formed in human evolution permit the adoption of novel purposes, even ones inimical to survival. The adoption can be arbitrary - any type of outcome we represent to ourselves can be adopted. But arbitrary purposes are not sustained for long. Peirce suggested that some types of possibility are more likely to be made purposes (or to remain purposes) than others, just because of the types that they are. Ideas, he said - meaning by "idea" an objective type and not necessarily its subjective grasp only - "have a power of finding or creating their vehicles, and having found them, of conferring on them the ability to transform the face of the earth" (1.217). As in the behavior of the lower animals, only more so, self-control con- sists in control by types of possible outcome. We are free only in subordi- nating ourselves to purposes higher than ourselves. That some general ideas have greater power than others to work themselves out into fact (the language is Peirces: 2.149), helps, with a large admixture of chance, to explain the direction of cultural evolution. 675</page><page sequence="14">^O All of the preceding, and more along those lines, is in the book, and Z therefore I am once again at a loss to explain Pape s complaint that "At O no point Short addresses" questions concerning cultural evolution. (In HH addition to the sections cited above, I spend more space in Ch.12 than t""1 some readers might like on the evolution of scientific ideas and values. ^ That includes a gloss of Peirces essay, "The Fixation of Belief," in which ^ I argue that the concept of truth that he advanced therein is one that he ^ implied is a product of a cultural evolution, still incomplete, in con- ^~¡ tradistinction to the minimalist concept of truth, fixed by ordinary /J usage, that he also presented in that same essay, anticipating a currently , fashionable view.) Oddly enough, in the same section of his remarks, Pape refers to my "misleading" assertion that the preceding account of cultural evolution is Platonic rather than Aristotelian (since it attributes a power to "the type itself, independently of that types being. . .embod- ied"). Well, that assertion is somewhat misleading, since a philosopher imbued with modern science can hardly be expected to be Platonic in all respects. The point is merely that Plato supposed his Forms are pow- erful unembodied whereas Aristotle thought universals could act as final causes only when already embodied. In the remarks quoted above, Peirce attributed a power to unembodied possibilities. Pape says that "Peirce gave a dynamic, Aristotelian account of how purposes develop." But that is wrong, as Aristotle no more than Plato thought that purposes develop. The idea that novel ends could emerge waited upon Darwin. Peirce s pregnant allusions to the development of purpose is Darwinian. However, his account of that development shares something of Plato's idealism. And thus he evaded the conclu- sion that, if purposes change, it must be arbitrarily. Briefly: which pos- sibilities have power to become realized changes with changing conditions, including conditions created by earlier purposeful action; one purpose followed leads to new purposes being adopted or to more specific versions of itself being adopted. Many possibilities are not even definable except in terms of conditions that have actually evolved. The possibility of walking on land presupposes animate life and locomo- tion. The possibility of commercial enterprise presupposes conditions that evolved culturally, hence, through preceding purposeful activity. But, given actual conditions, then it is not arbitrary that one possibility more than another has a power to become realized. I think that Peirce, who began as a Kantian idealist, ended by gravitating toward Platonic idealism - with, of course, differences. 4. Peirce's Development Bergman is right that on my view we must distinguish between distinct theories of signs that Peirce espoused - more precisely, his 1868-9 the- ory of thought-signs and the theory that came to maturity in 1907. Not g_, that I deny that one theory grew out of the other. Not that I deny impor-</page><page sequence="15">tant continuities (Peirces theory was always triadic, embracing sign, &amp; object, interpretant). I do not think, as Hookway alleges I do, that Peirce &gt;% made a "fresh start" in the 1870s. Rather, my view is that a sequence of § major changes, over a period of nearly forty years, resulted in a theory a that had some of the same formal structure as the earlier theory but that • was very different in its conceptions of basic parts of that structure. The H crucial question, however, is not whether growth of the later theory was Í"1 gradual. Rather, it is whether there are fundamental features of the later ^&gt; theory that contradict corresponding features of the earlier theory or, o alternatively, whether all fundamental changes may be seen as elabora- h tions or refinements or additions, all contradictions being minor. What Bergman refers to as, on my telling, "monumental leaps," are what I allege to be three fundamental contradictions of Peirce s earlier by his later theory, each first emerging at a particular date. In that connection, I have to reject Ransdells assertion that my account of Peirces development is "pure fiction" because "based on no textual evidence of a biographical nature" and sometimes "going openly contrary" to such autobiography as there is. Contradictions are contra- dictions. It makes no difference whether they were confessed. Peirce sometimes made much of his changes of mind, but other times, he, like many other theorists, seems to have been reluctant to admit changing his mind. And, as all of his autobiographical remarks were occasional asides, there is no reason to expect to find in his writings a complete account of his own development. The evidence - the only evidence that in any case really matters - is in the theoretical statements them- selves, and my interpretation can only be refuted by showing that what I claim are contradictions are not so. Ransdell insists upon "trust in Peirce's competence." Such trust can sustain our efforts to understand writings often cryptic, but, when we finally essay an interpretation of those writings, it cannot take the place of evidence and argument. Moreover, it is a strange idea of "competence" in a philosopher, espe- cially one of Peirces extreme originality, to suppose that he never, in any serious way, changed his mind. Ransdell finds "especially bothersome" my statement, in an earlier publication, that Peirces mature theory has to be reconstructed from fragments, plus all that is consistent with them from his earlier writings. It is apparently to this passage that he refers when he later implies that in this earlier publication I was guilty of "gratuitous denigration of Peirce s competence." I am baffled by this reaction. After all, it is beyond question that Peirces writings are fragmentary, especially his later writings on signs. It is also evident from Peirce s own words that he himself was never satisfied by any of his formulations of certain key concepts, especially that of sign. Several of us have long been hard at work reconstructing a theory from these fragments - none more so than Ransdell himself. Why, then, he thinks that I have, by this statement and by my own interpretative ,</page><page sequence="16">oo efforts, assumed a priest-like authority, I cannot imagine. At the risk of Z evoking still greater ire, I must disillusion Ransdell about my having, in O the book, "toned. . .down" my account of Peirces development. While |- ' having benefited from Ransdells earlier criticisms in the PEIRCE-L t""1 interchange (see especially Ch.2,nn.9, 1 5), the benefit consisted in sharp- ^ ening-up my argument, not in toning down my conclusion. The above- ^ mentioned passage from the earlier publication is one I still stand by, my ^ failure to reproduce it verbatim in the book notwithstanding. ^ I also have to reject Ransdells assertion that my thesis about Peirce s /J development serves "no useful interpretational purpose." True, it does r not lay any groundwork for later chapters; they can be understood without it. Its function, rather, is to clear away a persistent source of misunderstanding, namely, the conviction that, if we are to understand Peirce, then his earlier and later statements must, with minor excep- tions, all be combined into one system. If I am right that he changed his mind about some fundamental matters, then there is no possibility of completing that project successfully. Perhaps that is why it has not been completed successfully. Happily, Hookway does deny that some of what I say are contradic- tions, really are contradictions, and, so, we may now get down to work. The first of the two issues he raises concerns Peirce s changing treat- ment of realism and nominalism. In my view, Peirce always treated that polarity dialectically; it was never a matter simply of affirming one and denying the other. Also, he persistently read what he took to be pre- suppositions of those respective doctrines into the doctrines them- selves, resulting in definitions of the two that are idiosyncratic though profound. He attributed to each a "theory of reality," the "nominalist" identifying reality with the causes of cognition (i.e., the causes of sensa- tion that are "external" in the sense of not being constituted by thought) and the "realist" identifying reality with the ultimate conclu- sions cognition attains. Each theory seems inadequate by itself. Thus, I do not think that in the Berkeley review he rejected nominalism utterly, though he seemed to. His statement of nominalism was sympathetic. Even earlier, and I think from the first, he wanted to embrace the nom- inalist assertion of individual existence, but to do so without abandon- ing the view that all conception is general. He wanted to agree that sensations inform thought and are caused by individual events not dependent on thought, but to do so without falling into the skeptical view that there are things-in-themselves that we cannot know. His real- ism derived in the first instance from Kant's conception of thought as being general, and yet he implied that Kant's affirmation of a Ding an sich is nominalist. There was never anything simple in Peirce s reading of the history of philosophy. The problem was that he did not find a way successfully to combine ,-~ nominalism and realism until later. His first attempts were patently</page><page sequence="17">unsatisfactory, even self-contradictory. He tried identifying the individ- *P ual with the external limit of the series of cognitions in which it is rep- ¿o resented, but was forced to admit that the external limit, being external, § is unknowable and therefore cannot sensibly be affirmed to be real. He a tried identifying the individual with the potentially infinite sum of gen- # eral characters that could correctly be affirmed of it, but was forced to H admit that a sum of general characters is still general, not singular. Any P1 two individuals will differ in some character, so this doctrine explains j£&gt; individuation, but it does not explain individuality. It does not account o for the spatio-temporal uniqueness of individual existence or for our h apprehension of that existence. In 1 877 and thereafter, Peirce retained the "realist" view of reality, that reality is as it would be represented to be in the final opinion toward which inquiry tends, but he combined that view with an affir- mation of individual existence, independent of thought. Hookway rep- resents well and accurately what my view is of what Peirce s view then became. It is that the final opinion, toward which inquiry tends, will describe in general terms the individual causes "required to explain how the convergence of opinion comes about." The nominalist theory is thus subsumed in the realist theory. (Peirce continued to rail against nominalism, as the root error of all modern thought, but then meant by that term, as Max Fisch has shown (1986, Ch.10), any metaphysics that omits either individuality (existence) or generality (law, continuity, reality) or (adding the first of his three categories) qualitative possibil- ity.) Hookway seems to be saying that, in my view, Peirce first rejected nominalism but later accepted it "without qualification." But subsum- ing it in realism would seem to me to be a qualification of it. (What I say (p.47) is that it in 1877, nominalism was "adopted without the qualification made heretofore, that the individual is real only insofar as it is general." The qualification there alleged to be dropped is on the nature of the individual, not on the doctrine of nominalism.) Why didn't Peirce say in the 1860s and in 1870 what he said in 1 877 and thereafter? Hookway himself states, succinctly, what was the problem with Peirce s early position: "In the 1860s, Peirce held that there were no individuals or singulars, recognizing that all signs are gen- eral in their signification." He could not affirm singularity consistently with his views (a) that there is nothing incognizable and (b) that all thought is general. It is thesis (b) that gave way. Its giving way was fore- shadowed in 1877 but not accomplished until the mid- 1880s, when Peirce identified indexical signs as singular in their mode of significa- tion. (This was connected with the discovery of quantification in for- mal logic, by Peirce and his student, O.H. Mitchell, but I think it preceded rather than followed that discovery.) He continued to main- tain that thought is general in conceptual content, but he supple- mented that view with an addition of signs that are not general. ,</page><page sequence="18">c/3 Indexical signs, he said, are connected to their objects not by general ÍZj rules but by existential relations. Thus, by their means, we can pick out O individuals, whereas symbols, as they signify by convention, custom, HH habit, instinct or other general rule, can only represent general types. i""1 (At about this time, he also spoke of icons as signifying via embodied ^ qualities. This also is general, but not in the same sense as symbolic sig- ^ nification is general: see my Ch.3,5.) To maintain the view that indi- ar viduals are knowable, Peirce had not only to expand his theory of signs ^ but also to develop a corresponding analysis of experience; hence his /J phenomenological or phaneroscopic writings that began c.1885, r though not so named until later, lstness and 2ndness in experience explain iconic and indexical signification, respectively, while 3rdness in experience partly explains and is partly explained by symbolic significa- tion (see my Ch.. 3,6-8). Now, Peirce did use the word "index" earlier, in 1867, for signs that denote individuals (earlier still, he used the word "sign" in that sense). But, as Murray Murphey pointed out, in those early years, Peirce nev- ertheless conceived of such signs as signifying by a general rule or con- ception (Murphey 1961, pp.298-300). And, therefore, his early account just didn't work. For, as Peirce said very clearly in the 1880s, you cannot get to the individual from the general. The first major step toward his later theory of signs was the discovery of the (genuine) index, the index that refers by other than general means. But how do general ideas get predicated of individual objects? The key, I think, is found still later, in the 1900s, in Peirce s concept of the legisign. A legisign is a replicable type. All symbols are legisigns (though not conversely), but a legisigns replicas (or tokens) are indices. As indexical, they can be triggered by an individual event. One who knows how in general to use the word "yellow" and knows in general what uses of that word are intended to convey, is thus prepared to say, "Yellow," on occasions of a general kind; but each such occasion is particular. The occasion may be the occurrence of a sensation (though there must be a context, partly in a persons interests and dispositions, that makes that sensation salient). Thus, the replica of a symbol can denote an individ- ual while characterizing it (accurately or inaccurately) as being of a cer- tain type, namely, the type represented by the symbol replicated.3 So far, I see no difference between my view and Hookway s. Where, then, do we disagree? Before answering that question, I want to point out a respect in which Hookway has oversimplified my view of the development just described. As Hookway says, the classical nominalist view, in Peirces gloss, is that our ideas are "solely determined by the transcendental object" (my emphasis). I certainly do not suppose, as Hookway seems to imply I do, that Peirce ever thought that our ideas can be determined solely by external causes, much less, by ones that are gg unknowable. There must always be a context of general belief and spe-</page><page sequence="19">cial interest. Every discussion by Peirce of perception implies this. It ^ would be ridiculous of any reader of Peirce to suggest otherwise. In par- •■§ ticular, when a symbol is replicated, the general rule that governs use of g that symbol is presupposed; and that rule is bound up with a wealth of a common sense belief, theoretical presuppositions, human interest, and * so on. However, something of the nominalist idea - of solely existential H determination - does remain in Peirce s mature view. For, indexical ref- P erence is not reduced to symbolic meaning. The brute element of j£&gt; 2ndness is not swept up into conceptual generality. Peirce insisted, in o effect, that the nominalist element is not expunged by being subsumed h in realism. That is what distinguished his philosophy from Hegels. There is still an immediate, dynamic connection between sensation and its physical cause, on the one hand, and, on the other, between sensa- tion and some replications of symbols (not every replica is so caused). Only, replication is conditioned by general rules, the acquirement of a language, a cultural inheritance, and a set of general presuppositions - common sense beliefs, theoretical knowledge, and, sometimes, error. And therefore the external cause denoted is also characterized. Indeed, it could not be denoted without being characterized; but, at the same time, characterization could never suffice by itself to produce reference to an individual. Being characterized, the individual can, in fortunate cases, be known. Thus, it is no longer a transcendental object. Hookway s real disagreement with me is over whether this new doc- trine is consistent with Peirce s 1868-9 theory of thought-signs. I main- tain that it is not. For in 1868-9, Peirce asserted, unambiguously, that every sign must be determined by a prior sign of the same object, each such sign being a thought wholly general in content. With the discov- ery of the genuine index and of 2ndness in experience, that proposition was negated. Despite conditioning by language, background knowl- edge, beliefs, interests, and so on, there can be a first sign of an object, one linked to its object existen tially, as one singular to another singular. Such a sign is preceded by other signs, but not by other signs of the same object. In 1901 at 7.198 and in 1903 at 5.115, he explicitly affirmed that in perceptual experience there are first judgments. And that is a contradiction of his earlier view. I think it is a major contra- diction, as it means that Peirce in his mature period could assert that which he was constrained to deny earlier, namely, cognizable individual existence. It also meant that he could affirm that things that exist inde- pendently of the mind are nonetheless knowable. The second issue Hookway raises is, as he indicates, closely related to the foregoing. I have therefore already responded to it in part and can now be brief. Referring to the 1 868-9 doctrine that thought-signs form a continuum, Hookway writes, "Short finds this unsatisfactory because 'if thinking forms a continuum, then there are no individual thoughts,'" He then explains, quite effectively, why thought may very ^</page><page sequence="20">^O well occur in the form of continua. He says that we are led to think of Z thought as consisting of "sequences of discrete or individual thoughts" O by "examples where we go through a conscious process of reasoning" ^ from premises, intermediate steps, and conclusions. But I agree that t""1 thought is in fact continuous. Indeed, in the passage cited, I suggest - ^ apparently, too briefly - that reasoning from premisses to conclusion is ^ continuous, that it is only our representation of it in logical analysis ^ that introduces the fiction that it consists of discrete steps. Logical ^~j analysis can serve a good purpose without representing the actual flow *J of thought. What I find unsatisfactory is not the doctrine of thought's r continuity but the occurrence of that doctrine in the 1868-9 essays. For those essays do take logical analysis to describe the actual process of thought. Each thought-sign is said to be determined by a preceding sign inferentially, as premiss to conclusion, as if in a discrete series. (Much later, in the 1900s, Peirce described his system of existential graphs as providing a "moving picture" of thought, presumably because its diagrams and operations upon them are continuous.) That each thought is determined by a preceding thought, is, I wrote (p.36), "at best an analytic device not to be taken in every respect literally. How, then, should it be taken?" It was with that question that I left the sub- ject. For I do not think that the rest of my argument depends on this one problem being unsolvable, though I myself do not see how it can be solved consistently with the 1868-9 doctrine. Concern, or consternation, over my account of Peirce's development is greatest over my dismissal of the 1867 essay, "On a New List of Cat- egories," as unimportant to his later theory of signs.4 Bergman says that the view (of Ransdell, De Tienne, Houser, and others), that the "New List" is a foundational text, "is difficult to dis- miss lightly, as the 'New List' provides a Kant-style 'derivation' of the basic concepts of the theory of categories. . ." Precisely! The "New List" must be dismissed (but not lightly) as foundational, simply because it is a Kantian transcendental deduction of the categories. For, such a deduction is fundamentally at odds with Peirce's later, phaneroscopic, ergo, empirical and not a priori, derivation of the categories. Peirce did not remain a Kantian; his mature philosophy is profoundly anti-Kant- ian, and anti-foundational, no matter how much Kant's influence remains essential to his thinking, even, or especially, when he is reject- ing Kant's idealism and apriorism. Those who insist that the derivation attempted in 1 867 is one which Peirce continued to assume, either sup- pose or are thereby committed to the proposition that he remained a philosopher who identifies philosophy with a body of truth a priori. But, in addition to explicit rejections of a priori philosophizing that occur here and there, Peirce's architectonic c.1902 makes philosophy to be a "positive", i.e., an empirical, science. Furthermore, to suppose that f~j Peirce remained committed to a transcendental deduction of the cate-</page><page sequence="21">gories is to suppose that he never applied his pragmatic maxim to phi- ff losophy itself, in direct contradiction to the substance of his 1878 essay % on "How to Make Our Ideas Clear." ¡3 There is also the difficulty that the 1 867 derivation presupposes the n adequacy of (what we now call) monadic predicate logic, the inade- * quacy of which Peirce himself exposed three years later in his 1870 H memoir on "The Logic of Relatives" (W2:Ch.39; see also Daniel D. P1 Merrills introduction, W2:xlii-xlviii). One might try to redo the 1867 &lt;£ derivation in terms of polyadic predicate logic, but Peirce himself did o not make any such attempt, ever. His use of the algebra of relations in h his phaneroscopy proceeds on an entirely different basis, and is conjec- tural, without a priori guarantees (I discuss his phaneroscopic method at length, in Ch.3,2-3). This then brings us up against Peirce s repeated affirmations in later years that the "New List" was his "one contribution to philosophy," etc. Ransdell says that I impugn Peirce s competence and ask the reader to take my word against his. The latter charge is false. For it is one who makes assertions without citing evidence or offering reasons that asks to be taken at his word. And I do give reasons for my views. But neither is Peirce s competence impugned, since none - not a single one - of his later praises of that early essay specifies its argument. They are all ambiguous as to what in it he thought important. Thus, in light of the arguments I have made in the book, some of which I have just now repeated, I am free to suggest, as I did in the book, that what he was praising was his discovery of the three relational categories - a discov- ery that paradoxically occurs in the context of assumptions later rejected. It seems to me that those categories are so important, that there is nothing odd in Peirce s praising his own discovery of them, however much he later altered his understanding of them, his use of them, and his justification for their use in philosophy. None of which is to say that the "New List" should not be read. I have never suggested such a thing. Andre De Tienne s long and subtle reading of it, in his 1996 book and subsequent articles, is especially to be recommended. What I do say is that the "New List" does not need to be read in order to understand the mature theory of signs - that, far from being a keystone in the later arch, it was for Peirce a stepping stone to his later philosophy and has been a stumbling block to some of his students, who have been led by it to try to combine Kantian aprior- ism with Peirce's pragmatism. I think it is a case that exemplifies my remark, above, that an examination of Peirce's development helps us to avoid misinterpreting his ideas. 5. Signs, Objects, Interpretants Hilpinen writes, ". . .some things we are inclined to call signs are not signs in Peirce's sense, because they do not seem to have objects." Who ^-</page><page sequence="22">^o are "we"? Hilpinen proceeds to refer to syncategorematic terms as Z objectless signs, but words are not called signs in ordinary English. The O same distinction is made in other languages as well. "John" is Johns HH name, not his sign. If he has a sign, it might be the design on the shield J""1 he carries into battle or other insignia or the mark impressed in wax by ^ his signet ring. Johns saying, "I'm in pain," means that he is in pain, ^ whereas his grimacing is a sign that he is in pain. Words are called signs ^ only when they signify something other than what they mean, as when ^■J Johns saying he is in pain is a sign that he's feeling neglected and wants *J some attention. It is rather in a logical tradition that goes back to Aris- r totle, and to which Peirce contributed, that words are called signs. Logic is a science and if "sign" is to play a major role in that science, then, as Peirce once said (8.332), that word's ordinary scope must be extended and refined so as to make it a natural class of phenomena, i.e., a class of which all and only its members are explained by that science. Now, if Peirce is right that in this scientific sense every sign has an object and if Hilpinen is right that syncategorematic terms have no objects, then it follows that syncategorematic terms are not signs, sci- entifically speaking. It makes no difference whether Peirce at one or another time said otherwise. Like Homer, he may have nodded. There is no problem with his semeiotic in that. However, it is not clear that Hilpinen is using the word "object" in Peirce s sense. It appears that Hilpinen wants an object to be something definite, independently of what signs signify. This definite something must be ontologically respectable. Then we can employ the word "object" meaningfully in our theory of signs. It is a term we can use to explicate signhood. That is why Hilpinen is so alarmed by the sugges- tion that the object signified by a false statement is something, e.g., a state of affairs, that is not. How can that be? How can an object be something that is not? (And even when a state of affairs is, what is it? Suppose that, in fact, Theatetus is sitting. Does that fact exist along side of or in addition to the individual, Theatetus? Does it envelope him, like a cloak?) What sort of weird ontology will the admission of nonex- istent objects, states of affairs, etc. force on us? Suddenly, we find our- selves back in the world of Parmenides (or of Russell and Meinong), and the solution Hilpinen offers is Plato's, in The Sophist, that a false statement represents real objects in its subject and predicate, only it rep- resents them as combined when they are not combined or as not com- bined when they are. There is no object, Theatetus sitting. There is only the individual Theatetus, qualified, or not, by the property of sitting. Of course, there is something right about that, and, so, it is not sur- prising that Hilpinen finds Peircean texts to support this solution to the Parmenidean problem. However, the idea, that the (dynamic) object of a statement is a set of real individuals denoted by the statement's sub- gjw ject-terms, is not the whole of Peirce's theory of statements.</page><page sequence="23">What is a statements immediate object, and what is the relation ^ between that object and its dynamic object(s)? The same questions *§ must be raised about any sign, as Peirce understands "sign". And that is 3 where I think Hilpinen's approach is profoundly un-Peircean. Peirce n made the concept of a signs object internal to sign theory: the entire • structure, sign/object/interpretant, is presupposed in the conception of H each of its three parts. In particular, the immediate object is a ftinction P of the sign that signifies it. Thus, it does not have to be ontologically ^ respectable. That object is exactly whatever a sign signifies. As there are o signs of mythical creatures, impossibilities, and nonexistent facts, so h also, impossibilities, and the like, figure among objects. Talk of impos- sible objects makes Hilpinens skin crawl, but that is only because he supposes that those objects, if we are to talk of them at all, must have some status independent of the signs that signify them. But that is a mistake. For, Hilpinen, too, refers sometimes to what does not exist: he thinks impossible objects are impossible. And, on his own way of look- ing at these matters, he could not account for that sentiment. Let me illustrate the difference between Hilpinens approach and Peirce's with an example that is not a statement but that has the com- plexity of a statement, namely, a command. Peirce said that the object a command signifies is the will of the commander (5.473). The context makes it plain that by the commanders will he did not mean the speakers psychological state but rather the type of action that the speaker wishes to be performed, i.e., that he commands or wills. One who obeys the command by performing the act commanded interprets the command. His action is the interpretant: there may be an interven- ing thought, but it is not necessary that there be one. In this case, the interpretant fulfills (actualizes) the object signified. But not all com- mands are obeyed; the type of action signified might never be actual- ized. Suppose that the command is, "Ground arms!" There are ontologically respectable objects implied in that command: the indi- vidual soldiers addressed, the rifles they presently hold in their hands or on their shoulders, the ground they stand on. But these are not what Peirce said is the object signified by the command. Its object is some- thing that, at the moment the command is issued, was not yet actual. It is interesting in this connection to notice Hilpinens allusion to Peirce's anticipation of Hintikka's game-theoretical semantics. He cites, as "one of Peirce's achievements," his view that propositional connec- tives, quantifiers, and the like, "indicate how the complex categorematic signs in which they are used are related to their objects." Peirce and Hin- tikka, alike, have said that words such as "some" and "all" indicate who, in a debate, has the responsibility for selecting a particular item of which a given description is being asserted (see Hilpinen 1983). "All men are mortal," means, "Take any man you wish: if he is not mortal, then you win," whereas, "Some man is wise," means, "If I can supply an example ^,</page><page sequence="24">c/D of a wise man, then I win." In short, game- theoretical semantics consists ¿h of directions and permissions. And therefore it accords objects like those O of commands to quantifiers. The objects are types of act, in this case 1-1 semeiotic act, viz., those directed to be taken with respect to the inter- J""1 pretation of related signs. Therefore, at least some of the terms Hilpinen ^ calls syncategorematic have objects in Peirces sense. When Hilpinen ^ writes that Peirce s doctrine, that signs have objects, makes all signs to be ^ categorematic, he mistakes what Peirce meant by "object". ^~¡ Hookway, in his contribution to this symposium, advises us to dis- /J tinguish between truisms and their philosophical explication. That is r exactly what I think we need to do here. There is a truism that informs that long tradition of logic in which words are taken to be signs. It springs from the ordinary-language seed-bed of that tradition. A sign in ordinary usage is something that points beyond itself. What it points to or signifies, Peirce named its "object". Sometimes signs are misleading, and the object signified does not exist. Words similarly lead their inter- preters in various ways and sometimes mislead them. Thus, for scien- tific purposes, the word "sign" may be extended to words. And whatever words indicate or name or represent or express or state or command, etc. is their object, i.e., their immediate object. It is of fun- damental importance to the philosophies of language and mind that these objects do not always exist or obtain. In short, they are in Brentanos sense intentional objects. That there are such objects is the truism that is to be explicated. Its mere assertion (a staple of semiotic writing) is not its explication. We look to Peirce s semeiotic for its expli- cation, and are therefore surprised that his use of "immediate object" within that semeiotic merely reproduces the truism. But that is no objection to Peirces theory. For, as indicated earlier, its point is to shift attention to the interpretant, or to the end-directed process of sign-interpretation, i.e., semeiosis. It is in the theory of semeiosis, or {pace Liszka) rhetoric, that we are to find an account of intentionality. Semeiosis determines the variety of objects, existent and nonexistent, that signs in their variety signify. Briefly: the object some- thing is interpreted as signifying (that is, its immediate object) is that, of any ontological category, and whether it obtains or not, which, if it did obtain (within its category, i.e., whatever "obtaining" means in that category), would make that interpretant appropriate to its purpose. (See p. 158 of the book for a more exact formulation.) There are no intentional objects floating around unintended; they are functions of signification. And there are no items, such as thoughts or brain events or words or signs or feelings or blips of consciousness, that in them- selves have intentionality. All of these have intentionality, that is to say, they have immediate or intentional objects, only in the larger context of purposeful activity, actual or potential. On the account I have devel- r q( oped at length in the book, the root of all meaningful talk of non-being</page><page sequence="25">is in the non-mechanical, statistical aspects of physical processes. In ff particular, signifying what is not is to be explained by the purposeful- ►S ness of that behavior, human or animal, conscious or not conscious, 3 cognitive or practical or affective, in which signs are interpreted. a So much for the immediate object. But purposes are not achieved by * wishing. That is why reality matters. It is only in relation to reality that H some objects signified may be said not to be. And hence the need to dis- P tinguish a sign's immediate from its dynamic object. Dynamic objects, &lt;*&gt; as they are not mere functions of signification, must be respectable, o ontologically. At the same time, however, they must be intimately con- h nected to immediate objects. For it is through signs and their immedi- ate objects that we apprehend reality. One leads us to the other. According to the theory of Stahl, Priestly, and others, phlogiston is a substance in combustibles that escapes during combustion; the imme- diate object of "phlogiston" is this substance, which some, for good rea- son, supposed to have negative weight. But there is no such substance. The dynamic object of phlogiston theory is the real nature of combus- tion. For it is in terms of combustion that phlogiston is defined and it is by experiments with combustibles that the phlogiston theory was dis- proved. Combustion was misdescribed in the phlogiston theory. But misdescription is description. In misdescription, there is some true description entailed and/or an indexical component, and these enable us to look again at what was misdescribed and see, perhaps through ingenious experiments, that the description is false. But even when a theory is true, it does not tell you all about its dynamic object. Even in such a case, therefore, we can distinguish a signs dynamic object from its immediate object. The dynamic object is that which can be signified by many different signs, each representing it or picking it out, etc. through a different aspect. Following Peirce closely, I said that the immediate object of a sign is its dynamic object, as represented (accurately or not, and never com- pletely) in that sign. This has caused Hilpinen great pain, who finds the doctrine "almost as puzzling as the doctrine of the trinity." He then pro- ceeds to make the same distinction in much the same way, albeit with reference to the doctrines of Husserl, Meinong, Kit Fine, and others. But there is an important difference, by which he attempts to free his account of theological taint. In each case, he suggests that the immedi- ate object (or its equivalent) is something linguistic, such as a description or a Fregean Sinn. Once again, he is seeking ontological respectability for an entity that he wrongly supposes to exist independently of semeio- sis. When I refer to a person, who had many attributes and experiences of which I am unaware, as "my mother," then that person, with all of those experiences and attributes, is the dynamic object of my words, but only qua my mother is she their immediate object. Hilpinen suggests that the immediate object in this case is "the description itself or its ^g</page><page sequence="26">^o sense." But that is clearly wrong, since the object is my mother, who was 2 neither a description nor a sense. For the same reason, his later identifi- O cation of a "qua object" as "an individual together with a property attrib- HH uted to the individual" - suggesting a set-theoretical account, wherein I""1 an immediate object is an ordered pair, individual, attributed prop- ^ erty&gt; - will not work. My mother was not an ordered pair, in one part ^ an animal and in another part a description - a chimera that only a ^ philosopher could love. ^~¡ Perhaps it will help Hilpinen overcome his theological angst if I now /} suggest that the immediate/dynamic dichotomy might be understood r in terms of the familiar distinction between referential opacity and ref- erential transparency. When reference is opaque, it is the immediate object that figures; when it is transparent, it is the dynamic object. Jones believes that his father is a good man and that his mother's mur- derer is a bad man; he does not know that his father is the murderer. If every statement of what Jones believes involved none but transparent reference to its objects, then his belief about his father could never be specified except as self-contradictory. But it is not. It is merely mis- taken. We, however, can express our own belief about Jones' belief by saying that he believes a bad man to be good. None of this would make sense, if it were not the same individual referred to, in the one case transparently, in the other case opaquely. Opaque reference is not to an entirely different entity. If it were, then Jones' belief would not even be mistaken. I am not yet done with Hilpinen's worries about syncategorematic terms. It seems to me, despite all of the preceding, that they are justi- fied, to a degree, though only in light of a distinction that he does not mention in that context, between legisigns and their replicas, better known as the type/token distinction. But let me first tangle with some other remarks Hilpinen makes, that also pertain to legisigns. He says that he takes conventional signs to be symbols. Peirce, how- ever, did not always do so; he did not do so in his later and more con- sidered passages. All conventional signs are legisigns or their replicas, and all symbols are legisigns, but not all legisigns are symbols and, Peirce said, none of their replicas are symbols. Furthermore, convention does not exhaust the variety of general rules by which legisigns are defined: there are also customs, habits, and instincts, and, hence, there are symbols that are not conventional. A legisign is a symbol when it is governed by a general rule that determines its immediate object. A legisign is not a symbol, but is indexical or iconic, when it is governed by a general rule that does not determine its object directly but, rather, directs the interpreter to one or another aspect of that legisigns replica- tion. One who understands the word, "it" knows how, in any given case, to look to the context to pick out the referent in that case. Thus, CRR "**" *s an m&lt;^ex^ca" legisign because distinct replicas of it can denote dis-</page><page sequence="27">tinct objects. Whereas, each replica of "red" or "horse" denotes the ff same spectrum of color or the same kind of animal (putting aside such &gt;% ambiguities as "red" used to denote a political persuasion and such g complexities as "horse" used to denote a picture of a horse). a Hilpinen says that he finds it convenient to refer to "indexical sym- * bols" and "iconic symbols." But symbolic, indexical, and iconic signif- H icance are grounded, respectively, in three quite different kinds of P1 relation, and therefore no sign can be both an index and a symbol or &lt;£&gt; both an icon and a symbol. A complex symbol may include indices and o a complex index may include symbols (and so on for icons), but the h complex must, as a whole, be just one kind of sign if it is just one sign at all. For example, the pronoun "I" implies a description ("person speaking") and that symbol helps one to pick out the object of any one of its replicas; but those objects still vary from one case to another and can only be picked out by attending to the existential connections of replica to context. So, "I" is an indexical legisign with a symbolic com- ponent. What Hilpinen calls an iconic or indexical symbol is, in Peirce s terms, an iconic or indexical legisign. And, convenience aside, there is a reason for these distinctions. A proper name such as "Risto" is conventional indeed, but it is an indexical legisign, not a symbol. "Risto" does not describe its referent, which is picked out not by description but by an existential relation of name to named, perhaps a causal/historical chain of events. The repli- cas of a symbol signify what they do because of the symbol replicated, but the legisign "Risto" signifies what it does because replicas of it were employed in a baptism or other naming ceremony. If more than one person is named "Risto", then the legisign "Risto" is ambiguous much as the word "red" is ambiguous, and one has to look to the context to see which Risto is being referred to. These reflections bring us to a problem discussed in the book (Ch.8,3): although Peirce sometimes treated replicas merely as occurrences of the sign replicated, he at other times made replicas and legisigns to be distinct, though intimately related, signs. The latter position is reflected in his taxonomy of signs, but the former position seems closer to the truth, as replicas of symbols signify primarily through the symbols replicated, while proper names have no significance except through their replicas. And some indexical legisigns, such as "it" seem to have no significance at all, though their replicas do. The problem about syncategorematic terms that Hilpinen raises seems to me to apply to legisigns only, either indexical or sym- bolic. (Traditionally, syncategorematic terms are not indexical but are symbols, such as "unity" (or "one") and "goodness" (or "good") that are applicable in different categories but only with different significance: what, then, does the symbol itself signify?) Perhaps we shall have to conclude, Peirce to the contrary, that some replicarle types of sign are not themselves signs. As indicated at the beginning of this section, it is ,</page><page sequence="28">c/3 what the science requires of us that matters, and not each and every Z statement Peirce happened to make. O Let us turn, now, to signs, objects, and interp retan ts of another kind |- ' than those we have so far examined. I agree so enthusiastically with so i""1 much of what Kruse has written so well, that my response will be brief ^ and will consist, largely, in insisting that I did not mean what she in ^ some places says or implies that I meant. More importantly, her discus- ^ sion of music, which goes beyond what I have said or could within my *~\ competence say, illustrates very well, I think, the potential use of /J Peirces semeiotic to throw light on difficult but important topics. r Oddly enough, though I agree with most of what Kruse says, I am sticking to my story that music, when pure, is a pure icon - even though that is the focus of her attack. The qualification, "when pure," is not meant to be honorific but merely to exclude music that refers to something outside of itself, such as a military victory, a Biblical event, or even another piece of music that is, as in some of Ives' compositions, quoted. Surely some of the best music written has words, but words keep it from purity. This idea of purity is of no importance, except for the philosophical point, that feeling, e.g., musical feeling, without admixture, can be object, sign, and interpretant, contrary to what is so often assumed in materialist, rationalist, and irrationalist philosophies. That point seems to me to be of fundamental importance, and not only to a philosophy of art; but about that I will not say more here. Kruse writes, ". . .it is an oversimplification to claim, as Short does, that music itself or any particular musical work, is a pure icon. In the first place, emotions do not manifest themselves simpliciter in music. Rather, they are conveyed through the stylistic forms, devices, and ges- tures of musical tradition, as well as through nuances of performance." But stylistic devices and nuances of performance are part of music! They appear in what is heard. In one of his few references to music, Peirce specified "concerted music," and I think he meant thereby music as performed. Compositions are written, normally, to be performed. The importance of nuance - hence, of the performers interpretation - is assumed. It is so, even when the composer does his best to control every nuance of performance. Again, Kruse writes that ". . .a tone, the harmonic support of pitch, and a meter. . .do not signify in and of themselves. Their signification depends on the temporal unfolding of their relations to each other." But of course! Who would suppose that music is a sound contained in an instant? My crude assertion, that the feeling is in the sound, was not meant to be taken that crudely. Indeed, it is qualified by other passages, including some that Kruse quotes. "Consequently," she writes, "'containment' does not adequately express the nature of musical signification, especially since music is by its nature temporal." I fail to get the point here. Surely something can ,q^ be contained within a span of time and only in time. Of course, "con-</page><page sequence="29">tain" is a crude spatial metaphor (most of our talk of the temporal is in £0 spatial metaphors). But it serves to block what Kruse herself agrees ^ would be an error, that the meaning of music is something that lies out- s* side of itself, such as in the composers romantic disappointments n (think of Berlioz) . # But there is more to Kruse s point than that music is stylistically com- H plex and temporally extended. The complexity can be appreciated, she P suggests, only by one who has "some acquaintance with the music's style &lt;£ and form. . ." (and more to that effect, e.g., about the major/minor tonal o system). Well, I could not agree more. People who have not learned how h to listen, do not hear what is there. But there is perhaps a real issue here. Does acquaintance with a style, and learning how to listen to a certain kind of music, bring something to the sound (must I add, complex and extended in time?) that is not there? Or does it rather allow one to hear and to appreciate what is there? That issue can be sharpened this way: Kruse refers to a "convention in Western music of hearing and feeling major keys as 'affirmative'. . .and minor keys as 'dark'. . ." If that is truly a convention, then it assigns a meaning arbitrarily, hence, one that is not in the music itself. But I do not think that that is true. Could one by convention hear the minor key as bright, the major as dark? What is per- haps true is that there have grown up certain conventional ways of lis- tening that often facilitate hearing what is there but that sometimes cause one to miss what is there, to mishear or misinterpret it, and that make one too slow to grasp the stylistically new. To be sure, music is incomplete unperformed and unheard. The music heard is not physical vibrations in the air but is what occurs in human hearing. Thus I agree that "feeling in music is not a static con- dition, but rather a process that emerges in and through performing and listening." One who sits bored and unmoved through a perform- ance of a Bach 'cello suite hears the same sounds as everyone else and yet does not hear the music. But I do not think that that means that an appreciative audience reads something into the sound that is not there. Perhaps we should say that what is there is there only in light of a tra- dition, just as the meaning of any literary work is fixed in part by ear- lier usage of the words used. Then a piece of music would in a way embody its cultural past. In that case, my talk of "sound" becomes too crude indeed. But my suspicion is that that is not true, and that this is a respect in which music differs from literature. The past is present when one appreciates Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring" as a daring departure from tradition. But one who has learned to hear and to be stirred by that music, without knowing how revolutionary it was in 1913, seems to me still to be hearing the music. The one point on which I will venture to correct Kruse concerns her use of the term "logical interpretant." The acquaintance earlier men- tioned comes, she says, "by means of logical interpretants. . .habits of ^</page><page sequence="30">listening. . ." But not all habits are logical interpretan ts, though some logical interpretants are habits. Habits of interpretation are not logical interpretants. If a dog habitually obeys the command, "Roll over!" that is not a logical interpretant; it is a habit of dynamic interpretation. Even a habit of logical interpretation is not itself a logical interpretant. Now, if Kruse really does mean "logical interpretant" here, then she must be suggesting that it is essential to appreciating music to have an intellec- tual understanding of its style or tradition (of the major/minor system, etc.). Certainly such understanding helps. It adds something. But I do not think that Kruse means that it is essential. The non- Western musi- cal traditions, that she cites so effectively, developed without benefit of a formal theory, as did the folk music roots of Western music. Yet those brought up in such a tradition surely appreciate its music more than do Westerners who, even with a formal analysis in hand, are only begin- ning to learn how to listen to it. And, so, I do not think that Kruse means that habits of listening are logical interpretants - in the proper sense of that term. One parting shot, this time at Liszkas remarks on the division of interpretants (he knew this was coming) and on sign classification. I can only repeat what I said in the book, that both of the two major tri- chotomies of interpretant are necessary together, ergo, distinct from one another, if we are to make sense of Peirce s three basic trichotomies of signs. As for my turgid chapters on sign taxonomy, Liszka overstates my conclusion when he says that Peirce s taxonomy is "rather useless." Chaotic, unfinished, deeply incoherent, yes, but useless, no. Its very defects, if we would but work to correct them, point us toward novel insights. Such are the failings of genius. tlshort@earthlink. net REFERENCES De Tienne, Andre, 1996, Lanalytique de la representation chez Peirce, Publications des Facultes Universitaires Saint-Louis (Brussels, Belgium).

Three points must be made here to forestall obvious objections. One is that Peirce like others often used the word 'exist' and its cognates syncategorematically, hence, without implying actuality or existence in any metaphysical sense. Thus one says that there is a square root of 2 or that there is a mythical creature. The sec- ond point is that, in his metaphysics, Peirce defined existence or actuality in terms of his category of 2ndness - the here-and-now that makes for particularity - and distinguished it from reality, which he defined in terms of his category of 3rdness, or that of law, continuity, and generality. Physical laws, for example, are real and constitute the reality of the particular events they govern, but those laws are irre- ducible to those events. In his late essay, "A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God," it is God's reality, not His existence, that is at issue. That may seem to deny physicalism in every respect, but not in light of the third point. The third point is that there is no reality apart from existence. Reality is manifest in its power over what exists or occurs or is actual, i.e., particulars. A supposed law of physics, for example, is not real if actual events do not conform to it. See my Ch. 3,4-10. 2. I must thank Victoria N. Alexander for making me prudent. 3. Denotation is a verbal case of indexical signification, one that replicates a symbol of the type of individual indicated. Not all indices entail characterization of the individual indicated. E.g., pokes in the back or shouts or other effects, such as a weathervane's turning, that draw attention to their causes do not characterize their causes. But such indices are not interpreted except, in human cognition, through replication of symbols or, in animal behavior, through general disposi- tions to respond to indices of given types by behavior of given types. 4. Ransdell suggests that it was his criticism of my earlier essay that led me to include a section on the "New List" in the book, thereby getting myself "in even deeper trouble." But there was no room in the earlier essay to explain why I was ignoring the "New List." In the book here reviewed, there was room. I was not influenced in this regard by Ransdell's criticism.
