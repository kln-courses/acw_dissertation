Austin: Uni- versity of Texas Press, 1972. xxiii + 212 pages. Map. Bibl. $7.50. Reviewed by Talat Sait Halman Professor Muharrem Ergin, a leading scholar of Turkish literary history, has written the following words of praise about The Book of Dede Korkut, the national epic of the Turks: "I recall a statement by Prof. Fuad Kopruilui, the greatest historian of Turkish literature, in one of his lectures: 'If you put all of Turkish literature on one scale of a balance and Dede Korkut on the other scale, Dede Korkut would still weigh heavier.' The Book of Dede Korkut is truly the greatest among the monuments of Turkish literature, first among the master- pieces of the Turkish language." Although such praise seems too lavish and would be dismissed if it came from others rather than these two eminent authorities, the incontrovertible fact is that Dede Korkut stands as a masterwork of Turkish literature-and perhaps as one of the world's most impressive national epics. That this major work, which has an abun- dance of revelations about Turkish literature and culture, has escaped the attention of British and American scholars-despite considerable study of it in German, Russian and Italian-proves once again that "Turkish civilization," among all the major civilizations of the world, remains the least explored in Anglo-American schol- arly circles. The first English translation of The Book of Dede Korkut reduces the gap. Professors Faruk Siimer and Ahmet E. Uysal, both of Ankara University, and Warren S. Walker of Texas Tech, have combined their scholarly resources to give us an excellent edi- tion. This masterwork of Turkish epos and ethos consists of a proem and twelve stories, which can be read individually but are interrelated, being unified by style, characters, historical context, and by Dede Korkut who appears as both narrator and protagonist. Although the present text is a translation of a late sixteenth century transcription, the epic probably dates back to the tenth century. It might have been the work of a single Homeric narrator, but more plausibly it is a collective creation in the best oral tradition of the nomadic Turks. The Book of Dede Korkut, with its action- packed narrative in prose and verse, unfurls a fascinating panorama of Turkish tribal and feudal life-warfare, hunts, festivities, plunders, preternatural phenomena, heroics and love. The socio-political characteristics, cultural val- ues, morals and manners as well as ethno- graphic features it embodies make the epic a rich source for historians, folklorists and an- thropologists. The martial spirit holds sway: some of the battle scenes evoke the best of the Iliad, even though Dede Korkut's descriptions are far more spare and less stirring. Juxtaposed against the basic preoccupations with bravery, victory, defeat and death is a yearning for peace and tranquility. The venerable sage Dede Kor- kut, in addition to his r6le as a legendary hero, serves as the voice of ancient wisdom, moral</page><page sequence="2">82 THE MIDDLE EAST JOURNAL authority, and fervent Islamic faith. Even a cursory glance at the epic in its entirety dem- onstrates that it is a hybrid of pre-Islamic Turkic culture and early Islamic Ottoman fea- tures. The former dominates, however. Nomadic values, ancient mythology with frequent totemic and anthropomorphic references, and shamanis- tic features are such an integral part of the story-lines that the Islamic themes seem, by comparison, almost extraneous (they were probably interpolated long after the full epic had evolved). Among the prevalent concerns of the epic are not only heroism and honor but also social solidarity and justice. The ruler is expected to "feed all the hungry, give clothes to the naked, and pay off the debts of the poor." In the original, The Book of Dede Korkut is more impressive for its lyric formulation than its formal structure. It may lack the grandeur and the grand design of the Odyssey or Beo- wulf, and may fall short of Shahnamzah's res- onance, but it has innumerable passages of dazzling narrative power, and its r esourceful- ness in metaphoric depictions, epithets and lyric devices exerts a cumulative impact on the reader. Dede Korkut is living proof of the earlier maturity and the entrenched traditions of Turkish folk literature. The scholarly edition provided by Professors Siimer, Uysal and Walker is commendable in so many respects that a reviewer suffers pangs of conscience in pointing out flaws and omis- sions. This reviewer's main complaint is about the poetic passages. Although the prose sections faithfully reproduce the fluent, unadorned style of the original and capture the flavor of the unpretentious swift narrative, the verses fall flat. Dede Korkut, in the original, has metrical as well as free verse, and utilizes internal rhymes and end rhymes-occasionally even rhymes at the beginning of lines. Irrespective of what devices are employed, its poetry is superb. The pedestrian approach in this trans- lation is, in this reviewer's opinion, a grave disservice. What we now have is an excellent literal translation; using this, a poet of stature should give us a literary version. The Introduction is generally excellent but short: it whets one's appetite for a lot more. The authors could have extracted substantially more data from the available Dede Korkut scholarship in Turkey and abroad. The reader also wonders why the significance of Dede Korkut in the Anatolian oral tradition and in other Turkic communities-particularly in the Tiirkmen literature of the eighteenth century which produced a major figure like Mahdum Kulu whose work displays a pervasive in- fluence of Dede Korkut, and even in the folk literature of present-day Turkey, in the use made of some Dede Korkut stories by modern authors-has not been stressed in the Intro- duction. The notes, on the whole, are enlightening. The bibliography, although comprehensive, overlooks some significant publications in Ger- man and Russian and unaccountably omits Pertev Naili Boratav's Dede Korkut kitabin- daki tarihi olaylar ve kitabin telif tarihi (Istan- bul: 1958). The Introduction mentions Joachim Hein's German translation of Dede Korkut without citing the title. The full title, Das Buch des Dede Korkut. Ein Nomadenepos aus tiir- kischer Friizeit (Zurich: 1958), should have been included in the bibliography. In conclusion, The Book of Dede Korkut is a major breakthrough in the endeavor to bring the principal works of Turkish culture and literature to the attention of the English- speaking world. A Herculean task has yet to be undertaken to create a better appreciation of the long-neglected civilization of the Turks.
