<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chang Chih-lien WANG CHONG AS A CRITIC The philosopher Wang Chong whom I am going to discuss was born in 27 A.D., two years after the first ruler of the Eastern Han dynasty, Liu Xiu, proclaimed himself emperor. His life coincided with the first four reigns of the Eastern Han, covering Kuang Wu, Ming-di, Zhang-di and the early part of Ho-di. He lived to about 70, the year of his death being uncertain. He was roughly the contemporary of the Roman philosopher Seneca and the historian Tacitus. When he was born, the philosophical poet Lucretius had been dead for about 70 years. It is tempting to make an analogy between the Roman materialist and his Chinese counterpart. And I believe some attempts have in fact been made. But I am afraid a superficial comparison would do injustice to both. The deeper one delves into their system of thought, the more would one be convinced of their difference than of their likeness. I would leave you to judge whether it is justifiable to submit to such a temptation. Lucretius himself seems to be in favour of the comparative method, for in the last lines of the First Book of De rerum natura, Lecretius says: « One thing will grow plain when compared with another, ... so much will things throw light on things ». It is only where Wang Chong and Lucretius illumine each other that I shall draw a few comparisons. The intrinsic merit of great works of philosophy, it seems to 11</page><page sequence="2">me, lies probably in what they can deliver us from forces imaginary or real that are likely to impede a better understanding of the universe and to harm personal as well as social well-being. As Lucretius wished to see mankind freed from the incubus of superstition, from the fear of punishment in after life, and from the havoc of passion, so Wang Chong aspired to dispel the blind belief in a purposive Providence, in demonic spirits and their intervention in human affairs and in unconditional submission to the authority of sages and prophets. Wang Chong is essentially a critic and has been traditionally classified under the school of Eclectics. Summing up the gist of his work, the Lun Heng, Wang Chong declares it can be expressed in these words: « abhorrence of the fantastic and the ridiculous », which reminds us of Voltaire's « écrasez l'infame! ». I shall try to recapture the essence of his philosophy under five headings and devote the concluding part to an analysis of his limitations. (1) Criticism of the ideological interpretation of tien (heaven). One of the cosmological debates among classical Chinese philos- ophers had centred around the explanation given to the concept of Tien. The official ideology proclaimed by the Eastern Han regime followed the idealistic position of Dong Zhong-shu, who had proposed to Emperor Wu to discredit all other schools of thought and make Confucianism the sole arbiter. Tong Zhong-shu asserts that tien is the highest of gods, the father of all creations; it has its own will and possesses all the attributes of the human being who is none other than his own copy. It is capable of love and hate. As the son of tien, the emperor by his good or evil doings may please or displease tien who would mete out rewards or punishments through auspicious or inauspicious portents. If that happens, the emperor should make offerings and sacrifices to gratify or appease the Dispenser. The system of Tong Zhong-shu is further complicated and mystified by his attribu- ting moral qualities to the yin and the yang and the five elements which are all supposed to originate from tien. Wang Chong was bold enough to take issue with Dong Zhong- shu, the dean of the Confucian school of his time. Refuting the anthropomorphistic interpretation of tien, Wang Chong insists on its materiality. He contends that tien as well as di (earth) are nothing but natural substances. After having emerged from the state of chaos, tien and di become separated and have kept a distance allegedly of 12</page><page sequence="3">60,000 //. Among current theories of astronomy Wang Chong adopts the one that describes tien as a boundless ceiling or dome, hanging high above. He believes that tien in its movement releases enormous amount of qi (which has been rendered as vapour, ether or fluid) and it is the combination of qi that produces all organisms. « Tien covers from above and di expands below, so when the qi from below rises and the qi on high descends, all things are naturally created in be- tween ». (On Spontaneity). It is proper to draw an analogy at this moment between Lucretius and Wang Chong. Both consider Heaven and Earth as something material, and as the father and mother of all organisms. Whereas Lucretius explains the diversity of things by the different combinations of atoms, Wang Chong attributes these diversities to the amount and quality of qi that go into the things created. To Lucretius the origin of life is a swarm of very small and volatile atoms breathed in abundantly during life and breathed out at death. To Wang Chong, it is qi that brings life to mortals. But Wang Chong makes the distinction between yin qi and yang qi, the former being responsible for the bones and muscles, the latter for the mind and spirit. Death means the cessation of breath, that is, the breathing out of the qi which returns ultimately to the huge ethereal mass. All things are qi and to qi they return. Thus, both Lucretius and Wang Chong debar the intrusion of the supernatural and the attribution to the Final Cause, i.e., to an invisible power. It is the discarding of these ideas that constitutes a great step towards the liberation of the mind and furthers the progress of science. Once the material nature of Tien is ascertained and the super- natural dispelled, it is easy to argue against the teleology or purpos- iveness of the divine Providence. It is self evident that tien being matter is not possessed of will, desire and feeling. Wang Chong often compares the creation of organisms to the crystallisation and freezing of ice which are beyond all doubt natural processes. A more mundane analogy he likes to draw is between the creation of things and the birth of offsprings. « By the fusion of the qi of tien and di all things of the world are created spontaneously, just as by the mixture of the qi of husband and wife, children are born spontaneously ». (Ibid.). The principle of spontaneity is here stressed in opposition to the principle of teleology. « Man emitting his qi does not intend to beget a child, yet the qi being omitted, the child is born of itself. When tien is 13</page><page sequence="4">moving, it does not desire to produce things thereby, but things are produced of their own accord ». (Ibid.). Wang Chong ridicules those who think that tien produces grain for the purpose of feeding people, and silk and hemp to clothe them. It would be tantamount to saying that cats are created to eat mice and mice to be eaten by cats and the whole of nature to testify to the wisdom of the Creator. According to Wang Chong, it is only because grains can be used to dispel hunger that people eat them, and silk and hemp to protect from cold that people wear them. Lucretius in speaking of bodily organs also affirms that « nothing in our bodies was born in order that we might be able to use it, but the thing born creates its use ». (VT-834-5). But the originality of Wang Chong lies less in his natural philos- ophy, which can be traced to pre-Qin materialists and Taoists, than in his criticism of Dong Zhong-shu's doctrine of sympathetic interaction between tien and man, a corollary of his anthropomorphism. It presumes that human action, good or evil, right or wrong, can be known to tien which is capable of giving appropriate responses. The emperor as the all powerful ruler of man is considered to have received his mandate from tien, as evidenced by the presence of a red sparrow and a white fish, both being auspicious omens sent by tien, when Wen Wang and Wu Wang of Chou arose. But Wang Chong interprets the appearance of these omens as fortuitous if not improbable. As to the popular legend regarding Liu Bang, eventually the Emperor Kao-Tsu, as the son of dragon, Wang Chong dismisses it as simply ridiculous, for if it were true, Liu Bang should have the same nature as a dragon and would have been able to ride the clouds. According to Wang Chong, all things under the sun obey the same natural law: they can only be born of their own species. Kings and nobles being not different in nature from other creatures, there is nothing divine about them. Wang Chong categorically denies the possibility of intercommuni- cation between tien and man. The story goes that Zou Yen who had suffered from an unjust treatment cried to tien for snow in summer, and snow fell from above; that Qi Liang's wife in weeping for her husband against the wall moved the wall to pieces. Wang Chong ex- plodes these legends by homely examples: one can no more reach the water to quench the thirst or extinguish a fire by more wishful thinking. He concedes though that there are cases where some changes in nature do have effects on living things: it very often happens that 14</page><page sequence="5">when it is going to rain, mole crickets and ants move their habitations, earthworms emerge from under the ground, the bowstrings slacken and old diseases become chronic. These are natural phenomena and can be scientifically explained. However, it is altogether a different matter to say that an eclipse, a drought, a swarm of locusts or other visitations are sent by tien to reprimand the emperor or the officials for misgovernment. In refuting this absurd doctrine of reprimand, Wang Chong has again recourse to his favourite principle of the spontaneity of nature. The way or tao of tien, he asserts, is spontaneity, which means no purposive action. If it reprimands, then it acts pur- posively and not spontaneously. Wang Chong takes great pains to analyse and explain as far as his knowledge of natural sciences goes, all the natural phenomena taken or rather mistaken to be visitation of tien - rain, wind, thunder, eclipse, drought, change of climate, locust swarms, etc. He gives five instances to prove empirically that thunder is but a form of fire and has nothing to do with Heaven's anger. He concludes that all these phenomena have their natural causes and regularities independent of human, not to say divine influences. As Lucretius puts it: « nature is free and uncontrolled by proud masters and runs the universe by herself without the aid of gods ». (II, 1090-1). It is interesting to compare the description of thunder given by Lucre- tius and Wang Chong. Both deny that thunder is a visitation by god to punish the « sinners », for the simple reason that most of the victims are innocent. While Lucretius raises a long list of questions to Jupiter, protesting against his unfairness, Wang Chong asks ironically in his special way: « If tien could reprimand the ruler, he must also be able to appoint a wise prince... But it does the contrary: it first creates inferior princes who have neither principle nor virtue, and then reprimands them. Why then does it take all this trouble? ». (On Reprimands). Like Pilate, Wang Chong could not get an answer. But he himself supplies one: « In the text of the six classics and discourses of the sages, every now and then, tien is mentioned in order to reform the tyrannical and frighten the ignorant. They want to make it under- stood that what they say represents not merely their own wish, but also the will of tien. When they speak of tien, it is to the human heart that they are referring and not the empyrean blue. Those phenom- enalist (whose job is to spread superstition) seeing that tien has been spoken of as dens ex machina while calamities so very often happen, have thereby fabricated the theory of reprimands ». (Ibid.). 15</page><page sequence="6">This seems to be a fairly rational explanation, though not the whole truth, of the origin of this absurdity. Wang Chong used to complain that people nowadays do not even believe in the words of sages, but trust in the evil qi which is supposed to produce calamities, and try to make out the intentions of tien thereupon. What Wang Chong really wishes to see is a situation in which the authority of judgment be removed from the fictitious tien to the « saints », and in default of « saints », to the « sages », that is scholars like himself. Anyway, by exploding the artificial link between the human, the natural and the divine, Wang Chong has thus freed humanity from the fear and menace of the unseen hand and allowed the free play of the intellect, i.e. to let « things throw light on things », removing the intervention of any mystical power. The explosure and exploding of Dong Zhong-shu's theory of Providential teleology constitutes one of the main contri- butions of Wang Chong to Chinese philosophy. (2) Criticism of Superstitions. Superstitions are another mysterious force with which the ruling class frightens the people. Current superstitions about the indestruc- tibility of the soul say that the dead become ghosts and can hurt men. Basing on the reality that both the body and spirit are extinguished after death, Wang Chong declares unequivocally: « The dead do not become ghosts: they have no consciousness and cannot injure others ». (On Death). He maintains: « that by which man is born are the y an g qi and the yin qi: the latter produces his bones and flesh, the former the spirit ». (About Ghosts). The y an g qi cannot exist by itself when it leaves the body, and so cannot become ghosts. He adds that: « Man lives by the vital qi. When he dies, this vital qi is extinguished, that which maintains the vital qi is the blood in the arteries. At death the blood in the arteries is exhausted, so the vital qi ceases to work; the body decays, and turns into earth and clay. By what could it become a ghost? ». (On Death). Thus, Wang Chong fundamentally rejects the idea of the indestructibility of the soul. A similar idea is expressed by Lucretius: « You must admit there- fore that when the body has perished, there is an end also of the spirit diffused through it ». (III/798-800). « Death is nothing to us and no concern of ours since the tenure of the mind is mortal ». (Ill/ 862-863). « For death is followed by a far greater dispersal of the 16</page><page sequence="7">seething mass of matter: once the icy breath in life has intervened, there is no more waking ». (III/928-930). Wang Chong's atheism is built upon his interpretation of the relation between body and spirit, which the illustres by an analogy of the relation between the candle and the fire: « No fire in the world could burn quite of itself, how could there be a conscious spirit independent of a body? ». (Ibid.). As fire cannot burn by itself when it leaves the candle, so the spirit cannot exist by itself when it leaves the body. Since the dead cannot become ghosts, why is it that some people claim having seen ghosts? Wang Chong explains: « The ghosts that are in the world are not the spirits of the dead; they are evoked by intense thinking and meditating ». (About Ghosts). To Wang Chong « ghosts » are but illusions of man in his dreams, in sickness or in a frenzy when his mind is confused. This explanation in drawn from actual observations and basically coincides with the ABC of psychology and pathology. Criticism of superstitions is of great significance not only in theory but in practice. For in the Han Dynasty, the emperors, princes and the nobility spent lavishly on funerals. Disgusted by such practice, Wang Chong exclaims: « The dead have no knowledge and sumptuous burials are of no advantage ». (Simplicity of Funerals). Not only are they of no advantage but cause waste and destruction of people's wealth or even lives. He warns: « These expenses impoverish the people, who by their lavishness bring themselves into the greatest straits ». (Ibid.). Another important content of superstitions is the belief that ghosts control man's happiness and misfortune. If one wishes to avoid mis- fortune and secure happiness, one must offer sacrifices and pray to the gods and ghosts by way of giving feasts of wine and meat as gifts or bribery to curry their favour, as practised in the human world. During the reign of Emperor Liu Wiu the divinities of various im- portance to whom sacrifices were offered numbered more than fifteen hundred. Exposing the roots of the superstitious practices, Wang Chong points out: « Those époques in decline usually have faith in ghosts ». (On Exorcism). Superstitions are a mark of a declining society. He says, « Since there are no ghosts and spirits to receive these sacrifices, the intelligent people would have nothing to do with them ». (Ibid.). 17</page><page sequence="8">If by offerings, happiness could be obtained, or by exorcism, mis- fortune could be removed « kings might well use up all the treasures of the world for the celebration of sacrifices to procrastinate the end of their reign, and old men and women of rich families might pray for the happiness to be gained by conjurations with the purpose of obtaining an age surpassing the usual span ». (Ibid.). Actually this can never be done, because by common knowledge and experience, the rulers cannot rule indefinitely and human beings can not live forever. At the same time, Wang Chong refutes the absurdity, prevalent among the ruling class, of attaining immortality by the pursuit of tao and taking the drug of immortality. He argues that: « of all beings with blood in their veins there are none but are born, and of those endowed with life there are none but die. From the fact that they were born, one knows that they must die. Tien and di were not born, therefore they do not die. The yin and the yang were not born, therefore they do not die. Death is the correlate of birth, and birth the counterpart of death. That which has a beginning must have an end, and that which has an end, must necessarily have had a beginning. Only that which is without beginning or end, lives for ever and never dies ». (Taoist Untruths). By this exposition Wang Chong's not only expounds the natural law of life and death but also deals a heavy blow at the fancy of the princes and nobles who vainly attempt to rule the people indefinitely. In the Han dynasty, there was a class of people who practised superstitions as a profession known as phénoménologie ts. They allege that sickness, death or suffering punishment ware all due to offences against certain gods or ghosts. Auspicious days must be chosen for building houses, for change of habitation, for offering sacrifices and for funerals or weddings, and taboos must be avoided. These injunctions put people under restraint and threat by ghosts in their everyday life. Wang Chong wrote many essays in an effort to do away with these superstitions and to free people from mental bondage and win freedom of action. Wang Chong's atheism occupies an outstanding place in the history of philosophy, exerting an important influence on the atheists of the later periods (such as Fan Zhen of the 5th century). (3) Criticism of Confucius, Mencius and the Confucianists. The orthodox philosophy of the Eastern Han Dynasty as crystal- 18</page><page sequence="9">lised in the Po Hu Tung (Comprehensive Discussions in the White Tiger Hall) lists Confucius as a « saint » alongside King Wen, King Wu and Duke Chou. It defines the saint as someone that « can foresee and foretell and are in communication with god; they are born of tien ». Confucius, this « Born Great Saint », exalted by the powerful and influential personnages of the Han Dynasty, had become the inviolable sacred « authority » and his writings a protective talisman for the existing ruling system. In the history of freedom of thought, each new advance necess- arily appears as a sacrilege against things hallowed. Although Wang Chong does not deny the existence of saints and sages, yet to him « saints and sages are only designations implying excellency, virtue, wisdom and genius », they have nothing to do with divinities who are « obscure, diffuse and formless entities ». (The Knowledge of Truth). The two are different in nature. « Saints are not looked upon as divine, nor are divinities held to be saints ». (Ibid.). Neither does he deny Confucius' position as a « saint », but he opposes blind worship and maintains a realistic attitude: what is right is right, what is wrong is wrong; if there is any doubt, bring it up and clarify it. Vulgar scholars spread the notion that « the words of the saints and sages are infallible ». (Criticism on Confucius). In answer to this presumption, Wang Chong comments: « The words of the saints on various occasions are often contradictory, and their writings at different times very often mutually clash. Why can't anyone raise questions? ». (Ibid.). « If questions be asked on things which seem inexplicable, and Confucius be pressed hard, how can this be deemed a violation of the moral laws; and if those who really are able to hand down the holy teachings, impugn the words of Confucius, why must their under- taking be considered unreasonable? ». (Ibid.). In the Eastern Han Dynasty when Confucianism was solely venerated and Confucius was regarded as sacred, it took great courage and boldness to express such critical views. Although Wang Chong 's criticism of Confucius did not touch his basic ideology, yet by exposing the inconsistency between the words ani deeds of Confucius and his many self -con traditions, Wang Chong had shaken to a certain extent the « authority » and « prestige » of the « saint ». For instance, he censured Confucius for bragging about being all of from politics and material pursuits but actually having a craze for official positions; and, being no different from ordinary scholars, 19</page><page sequence="10">« his utterance is very common and unworthy of a superior man ». (Ibid.). To Wang Chong Confucius was not a perfect saint; he was human and not divine. He could not know things before hand. To deify Confucius and exaggerate his wisdom and ability would end in ridiculing him. What Wang Chong wants to discard is not Confucius but the blind submission to every word which Confucius had said. In his essay Censures on Mencius Wang Chong draws a picture of Mencius as a politician and refutes his assertion that « in the course of every five hundred years a true emperor is sure to arise ». Citing historical facts, he criticizes Mencius for « saying something which as no foundation and no proof, and is based merely on wild hypothesis ». (Censures on Mencius). Mencius became depressed when he failed to obtain a high official position. Wang Chong cites this example to show that he is no different from ordinary scholars. Wang Chong not only offends the « sacred » dignity of Confucius but in the realistic spirit of « scrutinizing his doctrine, investigating its meaning, and bringing evidence to ascertain right and wrong » (Criti- cismus on Confucius), he examines the « Five Classics » which Confu- cius had edited and points out that in the classics there are not a few exaggerations and illogical assumptions. He despises the com- mentators of the classics, saying that they « for the most part miss the truth » (Statements Corrected), for the very reason that these scholars regard the annotating of the classics as a way to a career, and as they are anxious for success, they do a sloppy piece of work and give a strained interpretation. Consequently « an unbroken chain of false theories has been handed down and truth has hid her face ». (Ibid.). Wang Chong scathingly denounces those exegetes who either know antiquity but ignore the present, or who are conversant with the present but do not know antiquity ». (Admitting Shortcomings). In Wang Chong's view, both are « unfit thoroughly to argue a point » and « are like dead men ». (On Intelligence). Wang Chong's critical spirit of daring to insult the « Saints and Sages » and despise their authority is admirable in the Han Dynasty when despotism held away in every field. (4) Criticism of the prevailing View of History. The same Dong Zhong-shu who propounds the view of « acting according to the will of tien », propagates the idea of « modelling after 20</page><page sequence="11">the ancient rulers ». He holds that measured by the standard of the « great order » of the ancient times, the later ages lay far behind, the reason being they are « lacking in the ways of antiquity and contrary to the principles of tien ». (« Biography of Tong Chung-shu » in the Han Shu). To then Confucianists, the merits and achievements of ancient kings, their social customs, moral character and even their physical appearance surpass those of the later ages. Such a view of history reflects the tendency of the landlord class toward conservatism and opposition to reform. « Even though the Han period has some real good things, yet those scholars do not mention them; conversely, they fervently believe in every imaginary quality of antiquity ». (The Necessity of Eulogies). Wang Chong firmly opposes the bias of « extolling the past and disparaging the present » and « cherishing the past and decrying the present ». (The Equality of the Ages). Applying his « theory of the vital qi », he expounds that the tien of antiquity is the same tien of later ages. « Tien does not change and its qi has not been altered ». (Ibid.). People of the former and of later generations « all have the principle of Five Virtues in their hearts and at birth are endowed with the same qi ». (Ibid.). Why should one say that the former are « honest and plain in nature » and the latter « unmannerly »? If it is said that the sages are endowed with « harmonious qi » at birth, then both the ancient times and the present have « harmonious qi »; saints cannot be monopolized by antiquity. Actually Yao and Shun were not as perfect as some people say and Jie and Zhou not as bad. There were bad people and bad things in ancient times and good people and good things at present. From this Wang Chong advances his view of the « Equality of the Ages » saying that antiquity is not superior to the later ages and the later ages are not inferior to antiquity. Wang Chong, however, does not stop at this point. He proceeds to compare in a concrete way the ancient times with the present. He finds that many of the legends about Yao and Shun are baseless; they are extravagant, exaggerated and highly coloured reports. He affirms the « exploits and remarkable feats of the Qin and Han periods » and says: « in virtue the great Han is not inferior to Yao and Shun ». (Ibid.). After citing many facts to explain how, with the unification of the country under the Han Dynasty, people of various nationalities mingled, territory expanded, cultivated land enlarged and culture advanced, he says emphatically that the Han excels antiquity ... « the 21</page><page sequence="12">Chou cornes short of the Han ». (Praise of the Han Dynasty) and « the Han ranks above all other ages ». (Further Remarks on the State). Whatever his motive might be in praising the Han era, Wang Chong did supply evidences that argue for the progress of history. (5) Criticism of Idealist Apriorism. One of the important reasons why Wang Chong was able to break through the superstitions about « tien », ghosts, saints and the ancients is that he upholds an empiric theory of knowledge in his criticism of idealism. Wang Chong believes that if one wants to know the nature of things one must let his senses come in contact with the outside world - « ears and eyes are needed in order to ascertain their real character » (The Real Nature of Knowledge) or through his own practice, « that which we daily see and daily do », (Weighing of Talents) or through the indirect experience of men in the past by « availing themselves of all the old and modern literature and plunging into the works of the various schools of thought ». (Simplicity of Funerals). In short, Wang Chong does not believe that there are « Saints who know thousand years of the past and ten thousand of future generations, who know spontaneously without learning and understand of themselves without inquiring ». (The Real Nature of Knowledge). Wang Chong calls it all nonsense what the Book of Prophecies record that Confucius could foresee Qin Shih Huang would die after arriving at Sha-qiu and Dong Zhong-shu would carry confusion into his book. Wang Chong admits that there are different talents, but to most people « knowledge of things come from learning; through learning, one knows things ». He says decisively: « No creature between Heaven and Earth is provided with innate knowledge ». (Ibid.) Thus he rejects idealist apriorism and the theory of born genius. Initial knowledge of a thing must be tested before its genuineness or falseehood can be determined. Wang Chong stresses that there must be «proofs and testimonies to establish the truth». (The Knowledge of Truth). Otherwise, no matter how extravagant your account may be, you cannot win the confidence of people. The myths that saints know things beforehand and that Confucius wrote the Chun-qiu {Spring and Autumn Annals) for the Han era are all examples which cannot stand practical tests. The prophecies manufactured in the name of 22</page><page sequence="13">gods and saints are likewise contrary to the general theory of knowledge. At the same time, he says that to test by perceptual knowledge alone is not reliable, because sometimes the ears and eyes may give « delusive semblances ». For instance, some people claim having seen ghosts or heard ghosts cry. If delusive semblances are taken to determine right or wrong, then one will « fail to find the truth in spite of the plainess of the proofs ». (Simplicity of Funerals). The Mehists believe in ghosts because they « thoughtlessly believe in what they hear and see ». (Ibid.). Wang Chong is of the opinion that « right and wrong are independent of eyes and ears and require the use of the intellect » (Ibid.), which means to make inference through thinking. Paying great attention to the role of thinking and inference, he stresses that one should start from objective fact and gain correct knowledge through judgment and inference: « taking signs and omens to investigate the nature of things, which he comprehends through reasoning ». (The Knowledge of Truth). To judge a person, we should not look at his appearance only; « we should behold his outward appearance and learn to know that which is hidden, and from his inside we measure his outside ». (On the Cunning and Artful). Only thus can we know the nature of things. * * * We have so far dealt with some of the positive aspects of Wang Chong's thought. But he was after all a thinker of the landlord class of 1,900 years ago and it was impossible for him to be freed from the bondage of the then domineering Confucian ideology or to exceed the level of scientific development and knowledge of that age. It is important to know that Wang Chong, belonged to the middle and small landlords class. He expressed strong dissatisfaction with the monopolistic rule of the powerful landlords and opposed the idealist and mystical philosophical system formulated by the school of Dong Zhong-shu. Nevertheless, his ultimate aim was to consolidate the rule of the entire landlord class. From the Lun Hen g we can see that he acquiesced in the « Three Principles and Five Constants » which safeguarded the feudal order. Aside from his doubts about religious authority, he raised no objection to feudal political authority, clan authority and masculine authority of husbands. His criticism of Con- 23</page><page sequence="14">fucius and censures on Mencius are superficial and not fundamental. He praised Confucius in many instances: he frequently quote Con- fucius in an attempt to defend his views by using the authority of the « saints ». He say: « The Literati serve as old embarkments to protect propriety and righteousness »; « if the people do not practise propriety and righteousness, they will overthrow the State and ruin their prince ». (Strictures on Han Fei Tse). Such a view is in essence not so different from Dong Zhung-shu's political opinion. In his natural philosophy, his views on ghosts and his theory of knowledge, Wang Chong, on the whole, maintains a materialist stand. But he attempts explain everything mechanically by his theory of qi and conjectures certain relations which do not exist. For instance, although Wang Chong refutes the consense that « tien » bestows « good omens » on a wise emperor, yet he explains that auspitious omens are the products of the « harmonious qi » which appear at the same time with the wise emperor who is also the product of the « harmonious qi »; so it is with the saints who also fall in with auspicious omens. Thus, though Wang Chong treats the simultaneous appearance of the « wise emperor » and the « omens » as accidental, nevertheless, he recognizes a kind of relation between the two which never exists. Wang Chong's theory of the « phantom portent » is again a strained interpretation. He holds that « the dead do not become ghosts », but presumes that ghosts really exist, only that they are not formed by the dead but are phantom images created by the « yang qi », « disharmonious qi » etc. To him, « the ghost is only an image, with no body: it appears only for an instant and soon extinguishes ». (All About Ghosts). Wang Chong is of the opinion that the phantom could indicate beforehand the decline of a state or misfortune of a man: « when a man is going to die, an unlucky phantom comes forth; when a state is going to perish, an evil portent becomes visible », (Ibid.). Thus subjectively, Wang Chong tries to explain the phenom- enon of ghosts by material causes (the Yang qi); but objectively he lets mysticism slip in by the back door. When Wang Chong uses his « theory of qi » to explain the social phenomena, his idealist view becomes more obvious, the error being most outstanding in his theory of ming, or « destiny ». He is most indignant at the inequality between the rich and the poor in the society, particularly at the powerful landlords having neither integrity nor talent but enjoying high salary and position while the talented and 24</page><page sequence="15">honest people are frustrated and disappointed all their life. He attacks the reactionary concept of blood lineage by exclaiming: « There is no bird which by pedigree is a phoenix; no animal which by species is a unicorn; no man who by ancestry is a saint; and no thing which is deemed consistently a jewel ». (Autobiography). But how should we explain the unreasonable arrangement of society? To this question Wang Chong could not give a correct answer. Instead of looking for an explanation from the society itself, he ascribes it to the working of a mysterious natural force: « Man's success as well as his troubles hang completely upon his destiny ». (On Destiny and Fortune). He repeatedly expounds the view that « destiny » is decided by the qi imbued in the mother's womb and cannot be changed: a person's good or poor health, his prosperity or poverty in life, or even a sudden death, are all predestined at birth. Moreover, he believes in anthroposcopy which shows that different kinds of « destiny » are manifested in man's features. Admittedly, the reason why Wang Chong posits that « original qi » determines destiny is to exclude the « heavenly gods » from human destiny and to show that the princes, nobles and powerful officials are not almighty and that they usurp high positions and enjoy good income not because they have outstanding talents but only because they are « destined » to be so successful. However, such an explanation is not any more progressive than the theory of the « Will of Heaven ». It is an expression of Wang Chong's dissatisfaction with the existing political power and of his helplessness to change this state of injustice. Objectively it provides instead an apology for the privileged position of the powerful. Another feature of Wang Chong's fatalism is his theory of « time » and « circumstance ». He believes that human society, like the world of nature, is controlled by an objective force which has nothing to do with human actions; no emperor or saint can cause the prosperity or decline of the society. Such a view contains a certain positive element in criticizing the absurdity of deifying the « wise emperor » and « saints », and of exaggerating the role of the individual. But what is this objective force any way? Wang Chong puts it this way: « Order and disorder depend on time, and not on government; the tranquillity and the troubles of a State are determined by circumstances, and not by its culture. Neither a wise nor an unwise ruler, neither an en- lightened nor an unenlightened government can be beneficial or deleteri- ous ». (Periods of Government). Here « time » and « circumstances » 25</page><page sequence="16">seem to represent an objective law, but actually these are but inex- plicable mysterious forces not unlike « destiny ».
