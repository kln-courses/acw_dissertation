<plain_text><page sequence="1">Number i Whole Volume XLVII January, 1938 Number 277 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, I936-37* EVERYONE is aware that in France, since the fall of Cousin's eclecticism, there have been no so-called schools of philo- sophy. The Sorbonne, in particular, has even been reproved for no longer teaching, as in former times, a unitary and well-defined doctrine. I do not think that this is a legitimate matter for censure; for truth can be attained, on my view, only by the free convergence of minds, without external authority or discipline. In any case it is a fact that, as it seems to me, scarcely more than three such philo- sophical dogmas can be distinguished in this country, namely: (i) Thomism, which is, though not without dissenting voices, the official philosophy of Catholicism; (2) Positivism, formerly organized as a Church by its founder, but at present divided into .several distinct enough sects; and (3) Dialectical Materialism, the youngest and most homogeneous of these divisions, possibly owing this advantage to the fact that up to the present time it has brought together only a small number of savants and philosophers. Neo-positivism, of Viennese origin, counts in Fragnce numerous sympathizers, but while attaching itself by name to the Cours de philosophic positive, nevertheless diverges widely, on many points, from the doctrine expounded in that work, to say nothing of the Catechisrne positivists, and on such essential points that the author of those works doubtlessly would not care to recognize it as an inheritor of his thought. One must add that among the men who have worked most actively on August Comte, the greater number are not affiliated with positivistic sects. Mention may be made here of Levy-Bruhl, Abel Rey, Gouhier, Delvolve (of whom *Translated from the French by H. R. Smart. I</page><page sequence="2">2 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVII. we have spoken in preceding articles), and of Ducasse, who after having published various studies on this subject, has now in press an important work on intuition in Comte, and is also preparing an edition of unpublished writings of the same author. Of course de Oliveira, a member of the "Conseil de l'Execution testamentaire d'Auguste Comte", gives a regular course on sociological doctrine in conformity with the principles laid down in the Systeme de poli- tique positive. But the "Society of the Friends of Auguste Comte and of his work", which exercises a noteworthy activity, is open to all persons interested in the great philosopher, even though they may not be adepts in his doctrine. Thus in the series of lectures or- ganized by the Society this year under the direction of Edger, one of the leaders of positivism, we find the names of Challaye, Fried- mann, Salzi, and Serrus, who are not closely connected with the movement. Moreover, a few of these men are known to belong to the Marx- ist group, for example, Friedmann, who published last year a well- documented, vigorously thought out work on La crise du progress ' This group has begun publication of a Cours de marxisme,2 with the collaboration of Messrs. Baby, Friedmann, Maublanc and Wal- lon. It has also brought out a second volume of A la lumie're du marxisme3 by Messrs. Cornu, Cuvillier, Lab~renne and Madame Prenant. * In saying that scarcely any 'schools' exist in France any longer, I do not wish to fail to admit that certain recognizable influences exercise themselves on writers of today, though those influences may be various in a single work. Among others, the effect of Bergson's views is always powerful. And a very characteristic example of this is the brilliant work by Maurice Duval, Religion, superstition et criminalite.4 Although dedicated to Levy-Bruhl, it is by no means a study of sociology in his sense of the word,5 but, 'Cf. This REVIEW, January I937, P. 2I. 2Paris, Editions sociales internationales. One may mention also as part of the activity of this group certain other courses of lectures, and Maublanc's appearance before the Societe de Philosophie (Bulletin, November I936) in connection with a very interesting and much discussed communication by Elie Halevy entitled L'Ere des tyrannies, on the authoritarianism common to the Soviet government, Fascist Italy and German National Socialism.

Le'vy-Bruhl, has just appeared, bringing within reach of</page><page sequence="3">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1936-1937 3 as the sub-title indicates, a "philosophical essay on superstitious criminality". Moral eloquence and metaphysical poesy are united in this work by a man who is at once a talented writer, an artist, and a soul in revolt against all the cruelty and mischief inherent in fanaticism. Bergson's basal ideas, the elan vital, creative evolu- tion, the secret and sympathetic unity of beings and the resultant intuitions, the opposition between 'closed' and 'open' religion, are here taken, not as theses to be discussed or confirmed, but as axioms accepted ab initio, after the fashion in which the Cartesians accepted the distinction of the mind from the body. Maurice Du- val's final problem is then this: If the elan vital is good in itself, how can it produce so much evil? By what new expression of this transcendent force, which revealed itself at the origins of civiliza- tion, and which we observe manifesting itself again from time to time in the persons of the great mystics, can humanity surmount the moral folly which mingles with its most elevated sentiments? Many other works may also exhibit the force of the Bergsonian imprint, but in a less striking fashion. Besides this influence, that of Brunschvicg is obviously the most active. But it is the power of a strong, intellectual and moral personality, of a certain cast of mind-and for some, of a certain manner of writing-much more than assent to a set of philosophical conclusions (something that Brunschvicg himself certainly would not desire). The objection will be advanced that he is at present the center of a flourishing idealistic school, and more especially of a "critical idealism". But those who call themselves idealists, and it is true that they are numerous, differ profoundly among themselves in their conceptions of man and of his relation to nature, from the religious spiritual- ism dominating the series La philosophic de l'esprit, or Mieville's already very different work, to the idealism of a Bachelard or that of Mlle. Konczewska. In her profound and learned study on La proble'me de la substance6 the latter defends this concept of sub- stance against her Master, Brunschvicg, and tries to show that in spite of "the decline of materialistic and mechanical forms of intelligibility", it ought to be allowed to remain in use. For it expresses a rational need, no longer to be satisfied in a pre-critical the greater reading public the large and learned works of the author on the mentality of peoples of inferior civilizations (Paris, Gallimard). 6'Paris, J.

XLVII. fashion, but by "the enfranchisement of thought from the forms first imposed upon it by its constant correlation with the organic structure of the human species, with life in the biological sense of the word". And this is, for her, the very essence of idealism. II A true unity manifests itself, however, in French philosophy in two other ways; (i) by centers of discussion or publication, which, without requiring adherence to a single doctrine, nevertheless bring the contributors together; and (2) by a spontaneous convergence of philosophical interest around certain questions. On the first point, there is no need to call to mind the "Union pour la verite" (formerly Union pour l'action morale), dating from the last century, or the "Societe franqaise de philosophic" and the "Societe de psychologie", both in full activity for more than thirty-five years. Their reports of proceedings, this year again, reveal what services they render to the production and exchange of ideas.7 Some time ago several other societies of a similar nature were founded, such as the "Societe d'etudes philosophiques" (Marseilles), directed by Berger, and which publishes each year a bulletin of its works, Les etudes philosophiques;8 the "Socidte Lyonnaise de philosophie", the Societe philosophique de Bor- deaux", the "Societe toulousaine de philosophie", the "Societe languedocienne de philosophic"; and the "Cercle philosophique de l'Ouest" (Rennes); to which the "Societe philosophique de la Cote d'Azur" (Nice), and the "Cercle philosophique lorrain" (Metz) have recently been added. An assembly of representatives of all of these associations has just been held in Paris, and it was decided to form a Central Committee to establish connections be- tween them and organize meetings among their members. Other centers of work, without being exclusively devoted to philosophy, nevertheless contribute to it in a very efficacious fashion; for example, the "Centre de Documentation Sociale de l'Ecole Normale Superieure", whose director is Bougle.

The "Semaines de synthese" organized by this group deal with general questions of all sorts, but particularly with those which are apt to bring savants, his- torians, and philosophers face to face. It began publication, in October I936, of a weekly journal, Science,9 the different sections of which are to be directed by Lucien Febvre, Paul Langevin, Aldo Mieli and Abel Rey. It is hardly necessary to recall that Abel Rey, professor at the Sorbonne, is also Director of the "Institute d'histoire des sciences et des techniques", which for two years has published its works in a fine and abundant review, Thales,10 containing many genuinely philosophical articles. To publish such articles is the definite object of the series Philo- sophie de l'esprit,11 directed by Lavelle and Le Senne. This series has recently been increased by various works. Among them are Le consentement a l'etre by Aime Forest, concerning the act by which the individual, instead of losing himself in appearances, may at- tach himself to the principle of all reality; Vers une cosmologie, fragments philosophiques, by E. Minkowski; and the Essai sur l'activite primitive du moi and La signification du sensible, by G. Nogue, of which we shall speak later on. And Le Senne has him- self also published three articles, one in Italy, the other two in Germany and France respectively (all in French), whose unity of thought is remarkable. They are entitled "Sujet et personnel12 "La relation ideo-existentielle",13 and "L'art est le portrait de la con- science finie".'4 Confronting the object, which opposes conditions to our action, but in a certain measure allows itself to be manipu- lated by us, the mind posits itself as subject; that is to say, simply as consciousness of effort and of an obstacle. But above this con- sciousness rises the person, that is to say, mind in so far as it is transcendent, infinite, inventive, and as a result, conscious of its 9 Paris, Editions Diderot. 10 Paris, Fe'lix Alcan.

"We ought to relinquish our subjectivity indefi- nitely, but for the purpose of enriching our personality more and more." The same hierarchy reappears in aesthetics. True know- ledge of art presupposes knowledge of technique, but art is emotion and sympathy, communication with other persons; and the mis- sion of art is to suggest the ideal and perfect mind by depicting the innumerable countenances in which it expresses itself. And this leads us to understand wherein consists the "ideo-existential rela- tionship"; 'exist' being used here in the active, affective, spiritual sense; and "intimisation" appears as the active principle of mod- ern philosophy in its entirety. The Recherches philosophiques'5 represents a different tendency, although certain articles it contains this year, for example, that by Arnold Reymond on "Verit6, evidence et certitude", reach the conclusion that spiritualism, deprecated so much fifty years ago, is perhaps the only metaphysics from which one may hope for satisfaction. This annual review is directed by a group of young philosophers, among whom one should mention especially Koyre and Puesch, who combine an active curiosity of mind, a love of new ideas, a taste for scientific methods, and great emphasis on documentation in all its forms. The Recherches often invites its contributors to deal with a single question, thus bringing to light its most varied aspects. We shall presently see an example of this, with respect to the idea of time. But there are also included diverse studies, for example, those of Henri Levy-Bruhl, Nogue, Levinas and of several foreign scholars (published in French). A rich bibliography completes the recent work of this group, to which the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences has just accorded a prize on the Dagnan-Bouveret foundation. III Next is an example of the second type of unity, that is to say, a unity of questions upon which are brought to bear, by a truly re- markable convergence of interests, the reflections of numerous French philosophers and some few foreign writers using the French language-concerning space, and (much more fully) time.

The series in which it appears makes it clear that the book is not written for technical readers but for the general cultivated public. Gaston Bachelard adds this year to his previous valuable publica- tions L'experience de l'espace dans la physique contemporaine17 and La dialectique de la duree. 18 The first work is perhaps the one best revealing his varied abilities. In certain respects it is a highly scientific and technical work, in which the author shows his mastery of mathematics by the very simplifications he introduces into his exposition of the uncertainty relations, and of the conditions of localization as the physicist understands them. His analysis leads him to a conclusion opposing what he calls "realism"; i.e., the idea that there exists, on a sufficiently small scale, ultimate bodies possessing properties analogous to those of ordinary objects (in- dividuality, spatial form, indifference to the fact of being, or not being, known) but carried to the extreme. Bachelard easily deals with topological and metrical ideas which seem to others to be pure mathematical abstractions. He finds the most familiar and amusing pictures to express subtle mathematical truths, and to enable us to perceive that "microscopic experience does not reveal a reality but realizes a chance". One must submit to his leadership just as one would trust an Alpinist friend, knowing his locality well, to lead one along picturesque trails, point out the promising vistas on the way, and thus finally to bring one, almost without consciousness of effort, to the summit where all the perspectives are coordinated. All of these characteristics are especially noticeable in the tech- nical analyses upon which rests L'experience de lespace; but the same talent exercises itself somewhat differently in the collection of studies published under the rather enigmatic title, La dialectique de la duree. This is an original book, whose first chapter, "Detente et neant", presents the theme, so to speak, and which indeed de- velops much like a symphony.

XLVII. by basing the continuous on the discontinuous-just as the illusory continuity of perceptible things rests upon swarming corpuscles and quanta-"to arithmetize Bergsonian duration", is to unite the two great philosophical influences of which mention was made above, that of Bergson and that of Brunschvicg, in a sort of fugue wherein two motifs distinguish themselves, rejoin each other, and combine. It is moreover to blend in a superior harmony the thought which would tend towards a pure intellectualism, negative in char- acter, and art, nourishing itself on intuition and feeling. We must also place Paul Valery (of whom this first chapter bears a brilliant epigraph) among those writers whose work has contributed to the production of these savory, spirited reflections, whose unique char- acter is only the more vividly felt when one calls to mind in passing certain of the movements of thought which they prolong or inter- relate. Although the same questions are for the most part involved, an entirely different atmosphere dominates the voluminous work by the Reverend Father Sesmat, which is divided into two parts, Le systenme absolu classique et les movements reels and Les systems privilegies de la physique relativiste.'9 The first part is an historical and critical study; a learned, solid, and lucid exposition of the theories of motion in mechanics and physics to the end of the nineteenth century. It concludes with the idea that these theories all presuppose a privileged reference system, and the author con- nects this system with the divine act of creation. Whatever one may think of this interpretation, the facts themselves are presented in a remarkable fashion, and the most competent men, such as Louis de Broglie and Elie Cartan, have bestowed much praise upon the cor- rectness and clarity of the exposition. The object of the second volume is to examine what becomes of this thesis in Einsteinian physics. Does this physics imply, as is often asserted, that any system is as good as any other, and that any choice made in this respect is only a free decision of the will? The Reverend Father's opinion is that on the contrary even in Relativity theory there are still naturally privileged systems, whose choice is not at all ar- bitrary. But here again, if the conclusion is paradoxical and such 19Two volumes, pp. 69i and 450. Paris, Hermann.

Sesmat is an excellent teacher; without drawing upon previous knowledge other than that of a good student of "elementary mathematics", he explains the more complex formulae to the extent to which this is necessary for a precise understanding of the problems, and with the moderation of a mind seeking before all else for clarity and utility. In the "relativistic" theory in which his work issues we discover the in- fluence of Hamelin's ideas, which were already influential in form- ing the conclusions of the first volume. But these final pages are not at all dogmatic in tone; they are presented only as attempts at interpretation which the future may corroborate or destroy; the author recommends the greatest caution in connection with the terminal inferences of this work-a work so bold in certain of its views. Although Michel Souriau's Le Temps20 constitutes a part of the "Nouvelle Encyclopedie philosophique" published under the gen- eral editorship of Dean Henri Delacroix, one would be greatly mis- taken in anticipating a didactic exposition of the questions con- cerning this matter. It is rather the inverse of such an exposition. To approach this book without a thorough knowledge of the dis- cussions and contemporary theories on time is to run great risks of voyaging in the dark, confused by the abundance of allusions you cannot recognize, by the sprightliness with which the author jumps from one idea to another widely separated from it, and finally by the virtuosity with which he loves sometimes to use words in an unexpected sense, which must be inferred from the context.2' But undertake the reading of it with a mind prepared, and with a good knowledge of the facts, problems, and theories about time, and it will take on an entirely different aspect. It will suggest to you a multitude of points of view, comparisons, and analogies, of 'Paris, Felix Alcan. Souriau is a professor at the University of Nancy. 1 For example, speaking of the necessity of measuring instruments to as- similate the various durations lived through by individuals and peoples, he says: "In order to bring them into agreement, something inhuman must be inserted between them, such as a flow of water, or the balancing of weights, in so far as these processes allow of numerical determination." In French 'inhuman' has meant, until now, only what was contrary to pity, to human civilization. But the author takes care that the following lines correct the false step that a first impression might have induced the' reader to make. I remark upon this stylistic play because it is not peculiar to Souriau, but often enough occurs in the most recent philosophical literature.</page><page sequence="10">IO THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVII. which you doubtless would not otherwise have thought. The "analy- sis by levels", forming the first part of the work, considers the various scales of time, analogous to those of space-astronomical, geological, historical, and practical (with reference to which he gives a curious collection of definitions of time in philosophy); then physiological and psychological time, social time, and ultra- microscopic time. The second part, "La synthese conceptuelle", is dominated by a beautiful picture, that of a flotilla of row boats of all sizes ascending the current of a river; he attaches to this picture a subtle analysis of the relationships between time and causality, and of the means by which one rises above time. The final word is singular; it is a non liquet, which he opposes to any rational prep- aration for the future. For, on the one hand, "between any assigned date, however near it may be, and the present moment, there is room for an overturn of the universal order". And on the other hand, supposing one does not wish to take account of so minute a probability, it still remains that our life, however well we may have organized it, will always end fatally in death. It is, moreover, a very singular characteristic of the great ma- jority of the writings on time to immerse the reader in an atmos- phere of emotions and feelings. Old, semi-conscious traditions tend to converge in this direction. Thus there is the tradition uniting the body to space and the soul to a memory desirous of eternity; and that which makes space the form of material things and time that of 'inner sense'; and perhaps we of the present generation must also recognize here the influence of the Bergsonian opposition between the intelligence, essentially spatial, and the profound life of the soul in pure duration. To this affective tonality of the greater number of studies on time no doubt Lamartine's Le lac also con- tributes, as do also Victor Hugo's Tristesse d'Olympio and Alfred de Musset's Souvenir. The latter, moreover, cloaks under a moving and musical form a perfectly composed philosophical dissertation. Whether the thinker allows his spirituality to be carried along with the current of becoming, or reacts against the passage of all things; whether he conceives of duration as the route of creation, or makes his salvation to consist in grasping the eternal in the very passage of the present, it is always time which serves as the theater for the great movements of conscience and feeling. In what precedes I have mentioned only books. But this question</page><page sequence="11">No. I.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1936-1937 II has also given rise to numerous articles. I shall speak first of one of more than fifty pages, "Paradoxes de la relativity sur le temps", by Edouard Le Roy, published in the Revue philosophique.22 This eminent philosopher and mathematician, always so youthful in spirit, brings to the study of these delicate problems a luminous clarity of thought, and a maturity of reflection, more anxious to discover what unites ideas than what holds them in opposition to each other. In the Recherches philosophiques Rene Poirier resumes his writing on a subject with which he is very familiar. His study, "Temps spirituel et temps materiel", aims at showing how many diverse questions and presuppositions, often unnoticed, lurk behind what is called "the problem of time", and in particular behind the current antithesis between the mobile present, a wholly unique manner of being, and physical space-time. And this whether one consider the latter to be the determination of what occurs by what has been, or to be given in its entirety, like a motionless railroad track connecting all the scenes which the train will pass by in suc- cession. In the same group of studies Kharsowsky reveals the in- compatibility of knowledge, always non-temporal in nature, and the change it resists. Construction of the past, present, and future is a sort of dialectical detour to surmount this antinomy. In an article full of humor and profundity Ruyer examines the ex- perience of cinematographic films whose motion has been reversed. He shows in particular that the world thus reversed subsists in appearance only; causality is not reversed in it, but absolutely de- stroyed. In this manner the tempting idea of a profound reversi- bility concealed in things, of which the irreversibility, on our scale, would be only apparent, is refuted. E. Minkowski, author of the work entitled Le temps vscu resumes its essential themes, altering somewhat certain of their aspects. Deception and regret are orig- inally for "what no longer is"; desire and hope are matters for the future. It is an eRan which of itself needs neither support by any representation nor to know its destination. Past, present, and future have only a factitious homogeneity; at bottom they are three dif- ferent ways of experiencing time.-Klossowsky associates time with aggressiveness, whose relations with sadism and romanticism he notes: Benjamin Constant's Adolphe is used to illustrate this thesis in part. Strauss studies "le mouvement vecu." (What an at- ' January and March, 1937.</page><page sequence="12">I2 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL.

But he studies it as a biologist having little confidence in explanations after the event, which seem to him to destroy everything specific in vital phenomena. The doctrine of the conditioned reflex appears to him to be a delayed echo of Cartesianism, full of difficulties and even of contradictions.23 Dumezil analyses rites, myths, and tales, from the point of view of the idea of time; he cites many facts interesting in themselves, but simply gathers and classifies them, without at- tempting to draw any conclusions therefrom. And two more articles deal with a subject still full of content-time in language. Groethuy- sen considers the forms of narration; Dr. Edouard Pichon the linguistic forms themselves. Pichon, who is a Doctor of the Paris Hospitals (which in France is a most highly esteemed medical title), is a very original personality, and has been seized with a scientific passion for grammar. He wants to approach grammar in an entirely new way, just as a biologist might begin a study of the forms and functions of living beings about which he had been informed neither by direct knowledge, nor by the previous tradi- tion of formulas and rules. He however lays great store, himself, by the logical norms in verbal expression. That this very philo- sophical enterprise should often be a little difficult to follow, be- cause of its originality and the new and sufficiently complicated terminology it involves, must be recognized. But what would be- come of modern philosophy if it allowed itself to become discour- aged by this type of difficulty? IV If the notions of space, and still more of time, have provoked so many reflections, this is not to say that other questions of general philosophy have been abandoned. In the first place we have a posthumous work by Pmile Meyerson, Essais, published by his family and friends in the last months of I936.24 It contains three 23 In two fascicles of the Actualites Scientifiques, "La question de la finality en physique et en biologie", G.

In these two articles he clearly indicates what he wanted to accomplish by his research, namely, to discover by induction what norm governs the activity of human reason, and to avoid, as far as possible, injection into his studies of any considerations on the nature of the world, or even a decision whether this norm is a permanent value, or one dominating only the twenty-five centuries of the culture whereof our age is the issue. Being myself brought into the discussions in these articles, with the author's habitual courtesy, I may not here state my own position, which in any case would take up too much space in relation to the rest of the present article. Permit me, therefore, to direct readers of this Review who may wish to examine this question more care- fully, to a recent study in the Revue philosophique.25 A closely related problem is treated by Francis Mauge in his L'esprit et le reel dans les limites du nombre et de la grandeur.26 He, also, seeks to discover in what consists the activity proper to mind; he, also, thinks that in order to answer this question it is not sufficient either to interrogate one's own consciousness or to proceed dialectically; and he, also, is quite convinced that truth is not conformity of the mind to a ready made reality, but the per- sistent continuance of our intellectual constructions in the flux of our sensory data. Although he devotes his first chapters to an his- torical introduction on the changes which have occurred in mathe- matics, it is as an analysis of the actually existing mathematics that the body of his work develops. He so to speak investigates the anat- omy of the operational processes functioning in our perceptions of number, position, and extension. Their common basis is found in a 25 Lalande's article, "Philosophie de la nature et Philosophie de l'esprit: les Essais d'imile Meyerson," appeared in the September number of the Revue philosophique.

XLVII. play of motor antagonisms, resting, in turn, on the activity of op- posing muscles. This is the source of all quantitive discriminations. The mind, on the contrary, acting as a principle of coordination and unity, recombines these diversities into syntheses, and forms of them more and more complex, better and better ordered, aggregates. Thus identity is not for Mauge, as it is for involutionism, the funda- mental category and focus of intellectual endeavor. Rather there is a harmony, a "mental fusion", which retains diversity as a value throughout the process of organization. However, this work is only the first of a series having for its general title La destinee et le problem du vrai. And specification of this final goal of the series explains the place made by way of anticipation, in this book, which at first appears to be only a mathematical philosophy, for the no- tions of consciousness and liberty. In her Unite et intelligibility27 Emilie Fiszer departs still further from the doctrines of assimilation, and would willingly adopt as a motto the contrary of Plato's dictum: "The like is a thousand times superior to the heterogeneous". She distinguishes two species of monistic philosophy, and successively refutes them. The first is emphatically ontological; it posits unity at the heart of things themselves, as did Parmenides, Spinoza, and Hegel. Carried over into the domain of positive science, it at first encouraged great hopes, and even acquired an apparent triumph by means of the ideas of universal mechanism, and (subsequently) of a necessary evolution uniting all beings. But this illusory triumph was cut short; the difficulties of monism, at first so slight, rapidly became aggravated. In physics it encountered discontinuities, uncertainties, and the irregularties of the quantum theories; in biology explana- tions in terms of evolution, seemingly in a position to envelop the history of the world in a unique and necessary process, have broken down from every point of view, even transformism finding itself strictly limited, within a discontinuous combination of organic equilibriums. Would one be any better off, in admitting that even if there be an element of irrationality in things, the mind nevertheless has as its ideal and task to discover and introduce there either identities (as Meyerson and I myself have maintained, though, as our critic very justly notes, in somewhat different ways), or "Paris, J. Vrin.</page><page sequence="15">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1936-1937 IS some other sort of unity or synthetic organization (of which she takes as examples the doctrines of Emile Lask, Nicolai Hartmann, and Leon Brunschvicg) ? She thinks not. Those who fancy them- selves able to translate 'intelligibility' by 'unity' have taken the wrong road. Real intelligibility involves discrimination rather than assimilation or synthesis. To explain, or to make intelligible, "is to render evident the particular elements distinguishing a concrete being from everything similar to it; it is to know the proper nature, that is to say, the individual character of an entity. It is to trace back all exterior manifestations of the entity to its in- timate nature, to its direct and immediate cause". This is not the place to discuss this vigorous argument for plural- ism, not only as regards the nature of things-assuredly a very plausible position-but also as an ideal of the mind-something more difficult to admit. For if it be true that progress in the sciences indeed imposes upon us many heterogeneities and discontinuities, it may also be asserted that human reason accepts them only as problems to resolve, and reacts against them as much as it can. It is hard to see what sort of a science or even philosophy it would be, which would set itself the task of disclosing the unique in each entity. And one may ask if this ideal, supposing it possible, would not even so derive its value from a twofold assimilation, namely that of the manifestations of a same individuality to or among themselves, and that of the knowing subject to the entity known. This book nevertheless seems to me highly interesting, in that it carries to an extreme a way of thinking that is often hesitant, unacknowledged, or only half conscious of itself. I am thinking of the theories, so frequent in our time, in which the plain superiority of assimilation as an explanatory conception (and, at the limit, the directive value of identity) is replaced by an accommodating ideal of order, organization, or harmony, by which an attempt is made to do justice both to the spiritual desire for 'the same' and to a complacency for 'the other', without plac- ing the first above the second or the second above the first. The same questions are to the fore in the new book, Vers une philosophic de l'esprit ou de la totality28 by a well-known Swiss author, Henri Mieville, although the aim and main part of the ' Lausanne, Edit. des Trois Collines; Paris, Felix Alcan. We mentioned here last year his excellent little book, Nietzsche et la volonte' de puissance.</page><page sequence="16">i6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVII. work are religious in character. It is however a very philosophical religion; and this is precisely what has made the work a great success. A professor at a Swiss university recently informed me that although published only a few months ago the first edition was already exhausted. He explained this rapid circulation in his country by the intimate union, in the book, of a very decided rationalism with a very genuine religious feeling,, detached not only from all orthodoxy, but even from belief in a personal God. In this wise the author has responded to the expectations of many Christian, spiritualistically inclined minds who are troubled by the radical fideisme, the extreme anti-intellectualism, of which Karl Barth, for example, has been an eloquent propagandist. There is nothing dogmatic about the book, which is composed of short paragraphs, without apparent didactic order, separated like Pas- cal's "thoughts", or those of Nietzsche. And these paragraphs often consist of commentaries on sentences, taken as epigraphs, from among half a hundred writers of all kinds. The author addresses himself to the reader; he reproduces the objections or replies he has heard on all sides, and reveals their weak points with pre- cision. The argumentation against authority in matters of belief and dogmatic theology is simple and striking. Whatever is grossly anthropomorphic or immoral in the greater number of so-called religious attitudes he reveals with a vigor which one feels is nour- ished by a passion for goodness, truth, justice, and beauty. He uses bold, cutting words, which make one think of Voltaire, quite as freely against the optimistic apologies of Providence and the partisans of 'whatever is, is right', as against the enemies of reason. But what, according to him, is reason? He admits from the out- set the distinction between constitutive reason and constituted reason, but without making use of these terms, which, for him, I think, would unite this distinction too closely to the involutionistic conception which gave it birth. And I recognize (without ap- proval) that one could indeed make a separation here, holding that constitutive reason corresponds to norms other than the su- periority of 'the same' over 'the other', of what is common, over what differentiates us. Mieville makes this pure and original reason to consist in an ideal of Totality, of Harmony, somewhat as does</page><page sequence="17">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1936-1937 I7 Mauge. He does not radically take sides against the values of assimilation, as does Mlle. Fiszer. There can even be discerned, in his view, the threefold criterion of the agreement of representa- tions with each other, of minds with each other, and of things with the mind; but he refuses to contrast the unity of communion and fraternity with organic unity, the identifying reason with a biomorphic combination of differentiated parts. The mind, he says, is a "function of synthesis and a power of innovation", quite as much as union and likeness of spirits made in God's image. And this God himself combines, in a singularly complex unity which leaves nothing outside itself, "the total, eternal, infinite, Being . . . the All of all beings", with the efforts of men working to create a better order in the world, and to realize an ideal, either by means of science, or by means of justice and peace among peoples. He is at one and the same time living spirit, thought, nature, and Abso- lute; He is above justice and reason, which are only human and limited attributes; but He is present in virtuous and intelligent acts. When Mieville speaks of the Divine he often makes one think of Renan, and of the subtle power with which the latter contrived to unite what apparently were most contrary concepts. But even when he disturbs our philosophical sense of real op- positions and conflicts, we still discern, underlying his thought, an admirably sincere ardor for all that gives conscious beings reason to live and to surmount their separate individualities. V We shall hardly pass beyond the limits of the same territory in reviewing certain recent works in the fields of philosophical psychology and ethics. La psychologie de la croyance et du mysticisme9 by Pierre Janet is a concise factual study, supported both by documents taken from the history of the great mystics, and by normal and medical observations made by the author him- self. The work also contains profound reflections on that con- temporary irrationalism denounced by Mieville, on the idea of miracles, the transformation of sentimental into reasonable belief, the de-individualization demanded by historical and physical Three articles in the Revue de metaphysique et de morale, July and October 1936, April I937.</page><page sequence="18">I8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVII. truth, and on the different strata of intellectual life, and the very different speeds assumed therein by the changes wrought by reason.30 In his Psychologie de la forme 31 Paul Guillaume, basing himself exclusively on observation and experiment, has solidly assembled all the proofs reducing the quasi-mechanical association of elementary states of consciousness to a very secondary and subordinate position. He brings out that the content of the mind, from its simplest to its highest forms, consists almost always in complex and organized aggregates, in schematisms and meta- schematisms, and very rarely in constructions fabricated from their elements. In this respect, this conception goes well beyond that "mental synthesis" which Paulhan had tried in former times to substitute for the illusions of psychological atomism and "the Polyp-like, pictorial mind". On the "mental synthesis" view it was still presumed that thought created the unity, in the obj ects thought, out of whole cloth; whereas there already exist, as Guillaume shows by numerous and precise examples, closely-knit and conjoint physical forms, whose complex unity is neither less autonomous nor less elementary, than those of the parts into which they can be decomposed. From all of these points of view the Psychologie de la forme (and it would be better, as the author remarks, to translate 'Gestalt-theorie' by 'theory of forms') is both a very personal work and a perfectly organized conpendium of the facts most capable of demonstration in support of this conception. Guillaume also examines, impartially and fairly, the objections which have been raised against it. And often, in what is the best way of refuting them, he reveals the limited amount of truth they contain. The movement of thought in geometrical demonstration is explained in a very original fashion as the passage from one structure to another, wherein the same elements present themselves as differ- ently articulated in diverse systems, while the static identity of these elements forms the bond of union between the respective 8'Cf. by the same author Les elements de intelligence, this Review, January 1937, pp. 22-24. 81 Paris, Flammarion.

The problem of expression, so prominent and so complex, is equally illuminated from this point of view, notably with respect to the expressive character which the sounds of a language present by themselves-a phenomenon whose existence had up until now been noted, but without any advance towards an explanation of it. Emile Boutroux wrote in i875: "The aggregate is merely the sum of the details." There we have a principle to which neither con- temporary physics nor contemporary psychology would lend any support. Abrogation of this postulate shatters at the same time the old frameworks of spiritualism and materialism, of empiricism and Kantian rationalism. And one may say as much of the too clear- cut opposition between the psychologies of consciousness and of reaction, and between metaphysics and positivism. This revival of old problems is not less striking in the new work by Ruyer, La conscience et le corps,32 which is also connected with the theory of forms, and shows to what extent the classic divisions of philosophy have ceased to be water-tight. This work will probably mark a date in the changed significance of the old problem of the "relation of mind to body", which has come about by way of Spinozistic parallelism and the "neutral monism" ad- vocated by Mach and James, starting from the idea of the soul as the principle of life in the Phaedo, and progressing to the Cartesian and Bergsonian opposition between consciousness and matter. All of these doctrines are still very much alive; and their ex- ponents vigorously criticize each other. Ruyer adds still more to these criticisms, and sometimes with. singular force. But in each one of them he also recognizes certain aspects of indubitable truth, and these aspects he organizes in a doctrine that one might call a 'reversed epiphenomenalism'. Consciousness, for him, is only another name for structure. The forms are veritable natural beings. And it is of the nature of a true form to appear "to view itself from above", to create a center of perspective differing in no way from thought. 'Of a true form'; for "a form which is only the resultant of a play of elements and does not direct them, or subordinate them to itself, is not a form: it is only an aspect". Instead of saying, with Lachelier, that extension depends on the consciousness of a subject, 82 Paris, Felix Alcan. Nouvelle Encyclopedie philosophique. Cf. his earlier work on the Philosophie de la structure.</page><page sequence="20">20 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVII. one should say that the properties of forms, which are the true natural entities, already contain everything essential to the con- scious subject. The 'gestaltists' he says, have an excellent psychol- ogy, but they forget it when they come to philosophy. They appear no longer to believe in the realism of those forms, whose indepen- dent existence with respect to our knowledge they have so well proven, and they again set about the search for dynamical ex- planations, quite as if structures existed only by means of a juxta- position of their elements. Here we have a fundamental error. The word dynamism is void of meaning; it states a problem, but no more resolves it than the virtus dormitiva explains the effects of opium. The universe of abstract materialism, alone, requires an external order just to be a universe and not a chaos; but a world of struct- ures should appear to itself as both a world of objects and a world of minds. But Ruyer does not restrict himself to this general view. With his customary precision he applies it to the question of cerebral vocalizations, to the theory of reflexes, and to that of adaptation and causality-which in physics just as little as in biology and psychology, is ever of the degenerate and dispersed type interposed, for example, in mechanics and the kinetic theory of gases. "In all real action, at whatever level, there is something which is already, in an elementary sense, reason, end, or value, because all real action is action in accordance with true forms rather than with hypothetical elements." L'essai sur l'activite primitive du moi, followed by La signifi- cation du sensible,33 by Jean Nogue, charge de cours at the Uni- versity, and professor at the Institut francais d'Athenes, reveals a psychogenetic system of philosophy of great elegance both as to form and matter. Unlike Ruyer, he attempts to construct know- ledge from the bottom up, starting with its simple elements, and following, as he says, the method of Descartes, Condillac, and Maine de Biran. He expressly turns aside from any pretense of a dialectic like Hegel's or Hamelin's; but he -knows these thinkers, and at times he even approaches their conception of a necessary generation of mental functions. The idea of effort, with which Maine de Biran's thought conies to an end, does not appear to Nogue to be the most fundamental. 82 vols. Paris, F. Aubier.</page><page sequence="21">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1936-1937 2I All effort presupposes, prior to it, "a presence turned towards an absence", a desire, a need, still ignorant of what is lacking to it. The two first notions, obscurely sensed, must hence be those of support (appui) and surge (elan). The bound and the walk (i.e., a series of rythmical bounds) are at the basis of all our represent- ations, notably those of space and time. A fundamental character- istic of space and time is therefore always to be vectorial, like desire itself. In the case of time there is the unique sense from past to future; in the case of space there is a double sense-from ourselves towards the object of the need, and from the object towards ourselves (e.g., the food seized, drawn near, absorbed). The 'support' and the 'surge' thus contain the requirements of a statics and a dynamics, of determinism and freedom; and their solidarity explains that of duration and extension, of past and future. They also make possible comprehension of the nature of the sensible, or, more exactly, of its signification. Making use of the excellent work of Pradines34 (to whom, incidentally, his work is dedicated), he looks upon sensations as advance guards and directive symptoms of what can satisfy our needs, somewhat as the increasing or decreasing noise advises one that one is approach- ing or moving away from the goal, in the children's game of hunt- ing for the hidden handkerchief. Everything ought thus to appear to us as if centered around our bodies, and that is indeed what happens. The 'object' of common sense and the philosophers is not a grouping of qualities constructed after the event out of elements previously given; in reality it precedes and prescribes the sensible manifestation by means of which we know it. Contigence, liberty et la personnalite humaine,35 by Mlle. Konczewska, whom we have already mentioned above, is an original study of a problem about which it might seem that every- thing had already been said. She vigorously analyses the ideas of contingency and freedom, distinguishing the one from the other, and noting their connections. She examines thoroughly the notion of 'choice' in its relations with consciousness, intelligibility, 84 Pradines, professor of philosophy at Strasbourg University since the return of Alsace to France, has exercised a considerable influence through his teaching. His principal works, we may recall, are the Critique des con- ditions de l'action and the Philosophie de la sensation, an enormous work of personal researches and philosophical synthesis, supported by extensive biological knowledge. 'Paris, J. Vrin.</page><page sequence="22">22 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVII. memory, and activity. And lastly she studies the human being's regeneration through freedom, by means of concrete psychological examples taken especially from the histories of art and religious life. The works of Beethoven are especially analyzed from this point of view. But even exercise of a profession, if it demands decisions and implies responsibilities, may give rise to a develop- ment of the same nature. Religious conversions seem to her to be the most intense, and, as a result, the most demonstrative form of it. Tolstoi, and St. Augustine who is particularly studied, provide interesting illustrations, serving to confirm the cases cited by Raoul Allier, and that of the strange life of Arthur Rimbaud. Voluntary choice is at first a sort of test, unique of its kind, by which an individual consciousness learns to recognize its real and profound preferences. But when it comes to revealing us to ourselves, just as we are, one may say of choice what Descartes said, in another sense, of the free will of indifference: it is only the lowest degree of freedom. Freedom in the full sense of the word is that wherein a being's consciousness, by this grasp of itself, reacts on its own nature, thus manifesting the existence and efficacy of norms superior to primitive individual differences. To examine the possibility of treating these norms scientifically is the object of Gurvitch's little book, Morale theorize et science des moeurs.36 The very title makes it clear that he does not wholly concur in the conclusions of Levy-Bruhl's celebrated work. While following him in the distinction between ethics and a science of customs, and also in the condemnation of a "meta-ethics", Gur- vitch perceives, beside a sociology which describes moral judg- ments and seeks their external conditions, a moral theory con- structed after the fashion of the physical sciences, and based upon analogous data, that is to say, upon moral experience. He renders precise the idea of this experience through the medium of a history of the ethics of the moral sentiments and intuitionist ethics, of theories of value, and of the conceptions of Frederic Rauh and Max Scheler. He derives therefrom a view of individual and collective morality, as a reality sui genesis, manifesting itself in different stages-experience of duties, of values, and of liberty. s Paris, Felix Alcan.</page><page sequence="23">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1934-1937 23 It would be interesting to compare these analyses of moral psy- chology with those of Mlle. Konczewska's book, even though the latter concerns itself with only a part of the facts studied by Gur- vitch. Lastly he summarizes the conditions for an ethics so under- stood, which seems to him not less indispensable to render precise the concepts of a true science of customs than is this science itself to supply the facts upon which theoretical morality may base it- self.37 We have here beginnings of great interest, which arouse hopes for an ethics that will be both positive and truly specific. VI The great number of philosophical works forces me to be very brief in treating of works of an historical character. The year I937, third centenary of the appearance of the Discours de la methode, is Descartes' year. The Revue de metaphysique et de morale devoted its January number entirely to him; the Revue de synthese, its April number; and the Revue philosophique, its July number. A series of brief lectures, on Descartes as phi- losopher, mathematician, physicist, and psychologist, were pre- sented over the radio, through the good offices of the Minister of Education, and will shortly be assembled in book form. Lastly, the Ninth International Congress of Philosophy, which has just ended, after an exceptionally successful meeting under the presidency of E. Brlehier, bore the name of "Congres Descartes", and the topics of the numerous papers were taken either from the history of Cartesianism or from problems which the Cartesian philosophy made the order of the day. Brunschvicg has given us a brief new work, Descartes,38 pre- senting in ninety pages a striking picture of the person and works of the great philosopher, accompanied by many interesting illustra- tions. This study of Descartes is not less pleasing because of the liberty of mind of its author, than because of the originality of its insights. It is a eulogy but not a panegyric. Although Brunschvicg admires and loves profoundly that great mind, he unhesitatingly reveals what he considers to be its lacuna, its weaknesses and " Gurvitch, also, acknowledges his indebtedness to Pradines, among others, for the germinal ideas of his work.

XLVII. errors, notably the facility of imagination by means of which the author of the Principes easily explains everything in mechanistic terms. Very true; but has not that naive confidence in the hypo- theses of structure and motion been the source of all modern research; and did it not arouse the enthusiasm of twentieth cen- tury physicists,39 and disturb the "conventionalism" which seemed to Poincare to afford "a soft pillow" for science? Charles Adam, who collaborated with Tannery in preparing the great edition of Descartes' works, has published a life of Des- cartes,40 making use therein of the erudition which has recently brought new documents to light. And in collaboration with Gerard Milhaud he has been able to put in print the first volume of a general collection of Descartes' Correspondance, revised and greatly augmented. The four following volumes are ready in man- uscript, but publisher's troubles delay their publication.41 The Essais sur Descartes42 by Henri Gouhier is partly a collect- ion of articles, partly unpublished studies. The work is clever, lucid, and very well documented. Especially attractive are the first essay, "Comment Descartes est devenu cartesien", the first chapter of the second essay, "Un homme content", the fourth essay, "Le malin genie et le bon Dieu", and lastly "La philosophic de l'homme concret", an essay containing two original chapters on the political attitude and thought of Descartes. In his study on Les Verites eternelles selon Mlalebranche43 Le Moine accentuates what has for a long time been called "the anti- Cartesianism" of the Cartesian Malebranche, and particularly his opposition to the celebrated paradox that if God had so willed, two and two would make five. Leaving Descartes, and coming nearer to our own time, we may call attention to two very remarkable works by Georges Le Roy, son of our eminent colleague Edouard Le Roy of the Academie des Sciences Morales. The first work, Psychologie de Condillac,44 3 On this point see the pamphlet by Brunschvicg himself, La physique du XXe siecle, which has just been published by Hermann, Paris. 40Descartes, sa vie et son oeuvre, Paris, Boivin.

The second work, on Maine de Biran,45 is of another sort. He attempts to make de Biran better understood; to reconstitute, in the light of works almost all of which are incomplete, the ad- vance of his philosophy to higher levels. Closely related to the ideologists at the beginning of his career, de Biran surmounts their doctrines by discovering the idea of effort and its con- sequences; from there he rises higher to the idea of pure spirit- uality, to the idea of God, but of a God conceived rather than ex- perienced. Finally, "the experience of grace" leads him to final peace, delivers him from his state of physical and moral dis- quietude. This work, which unfolds like a fine drama, and recalls in certain respects Maurice Blondel's Itineraire, is at the same time, in virtue of its rich and solid documentation, a work of scientific history. Centered about Renouvier, and referring to him, several highly interesting works have appeared. Jean Grenier, who is also a most refined literary writer, has interested himself in Lequier, Renou- vier's comrade at the Ecole Polytechnique, and his initiator in philosophical matters." He revivifies this strange figure of a passionate, but rather unorthodox Catholic, tormented by the problems of free will and predestination, who so profoundly in- fluenced the creator of neo-criticism. It is to this latter that Prat, who was his disciple, collaborator, and friend, devotes a fine study, Charles Renouvier, philosophe; sa doctrine, sa vie.47 The great criticist passed the last years of his life in Prat's home, and there he died. Prat was the daily witness of the elaboration of the Phi- loso Ihie analvtiaue de 1'histoire and of the Personalism. considered 4 Paris, Boivin. ' La philosopher de Jules Lequier.

The work is accompanied, in the same volume, by a very useful appendix containing documents heretofore little or not at all known, on the life and thought of Lequier, and also by a collection of unpublished writings of Lequier on La liberty forming a separate volume (Paris, Vrin), which gives much interesting information about the author. 4 Pamiers, France, Labrunie.</page><page sequence="26">26 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVII. by Renouvier to embody the highest expression of his thought. Prat emphasizes especially this last phase of Renouvier's phi- losophy, a spiritualism quite new in relation to the Essais de critique generate. This spiritualism has often been depreciated, in relation to those earlier works, just as happened when Littre separated the two careers of Auguste Comte. Prat, on the contrary, wishes to emphasize the unity and development of Renouvier's thought, in accordance with the Master's oral teachings and conversations. His book also contains unpublished details about Renouvier's reading, his manner of working, and the vivacity of mind which he pre- served to the end, in spite of his bad health. At his death, in I903, Prat found among his papers notes on the dates and facts of his life whose remembrance he wanted to preserve. And Prat cites the essential ones in his book. Whether or not one adopts the point of view Prat wishes to make prevail, against that of Seailles and most historians of philosophy, it will no longer 'be possible to speak of Renouvier without taking account of the ideas and facts pre- sented here. Still following the chronological order, we shall close by calling attention to an excellent work by Mlle. Ganne de Beaucoudrey, La psychologie et la metaphysique des idees-forces chez Fouillee.48 This is a solid, penetrating work, well supported by the texts, and it brings to life again in a very interesting way a philosopher whom many of us had known personally. On a great many points Fouillie was a precursor effaced by more brilliant successors. His theory of "idees-forces", especially, called attention in advance to the com- mon basis of thought and action, which had always previously been opposed to each other; and his doctrine contained all the essential elements of pragmatism, without lapsing into anti-in- tellectualism. Fortune perhaps served him badly in allowing him very early to give up his professorship, through which he exercised an exceptional influence on his students, and to live comfortably on the Riviera, almost continuously occupied with reading and writing, which was his delight. Had he published a smaller num- ber of books and articles, thus allowing his thought, inventive and open to the ideas of others as it was, to mature and clarify itself, 4 Paris, J. Vrin.</page><page sequence="27">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1936-1937 27 perhaps he would have been classed among thinkers of the first rank of the end of the nineteenth century. When it comes to material advantages, the good and the bad so frequently result from each other, that a wise man ought to hesitate before making wishes.
