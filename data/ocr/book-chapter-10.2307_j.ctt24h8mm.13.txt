<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter 11: Synchronic variation: Sydney Basin  11  SYNCHRONIC vARIATION: SYDNEY BASIN ENGRAvED    ART  Introduction This chapter looks at regional stylistic variability in the engraving component. The investigation is  restricted to motif depictions, given that technical variation here is minimal. Analysis was aimed at  identifying whether broad scale patterns could be interpreted culturally, not just environmentally  (McMah 1965). A comparison of these results with those achieved in the shelter art assemblage  is made later (Chapter 12).   There was initial concern that focussing on motif would not investigate style per se, but  mere compositional variety33. Given the overall aim was to analyse the engraving and shelter art  components at a comparable level (despite their technical differences and the variability that these  introduce to motif form), motif taxonomy appeared the most judicious approach to the problem.   Motif has been successfully employed at a regional and localised level, investigating a  range  of  stylistic  questions  (Clegg  1987,  Officer  1984,  Franklin  1984,  Smith  1989).  Sackett  (1990) cites various examples of how the combination of motifs and compositional features may  indicate high levels of ethnically significant patterning (e.g. Glassie 1975, Longacre 1981) and  suggests that ‘themes may well be the [things] that give congruence to isochrestic choices in non- material aspects of cultural life’ (Sackett 1990:41). While this type of classification had not been  previously attempted on an archaeological rock art assemblage, the approach used here tested  Sackett’s proposition. Correspondence Analysis (CA), which seeks patterning in the combination  of variables (motifs) in the data set, was considered an ideal tool for this analysis.    The CA indicated that the region’s engraving assemblage was largely homogeneous (see  below). The results were viewed according to the language boundaries in evidence at white  contact and to major drainage basins within the study area. These contexts provide an explanatory  framework for variation across the region.   The posited style boundary to the south of the region was further investigated. This was  initially  identified by McMah (1965). The Rock Art Project determined  the  likely  location for  this boundary was the Georges River - and that this boundary existed for both art components  (McDonald  1985a,  1990a). This  research  refines  further  the  extent  of  the  stylistic  differences  on either side of this boundary. Style clines are also defined and described elsewhere across the  region. These are manifested as increasing and/or decreasing amounts of homogeneity in localised  areas and varying motif foci.    Engraving sites in different topographic locations were investigated to explore the  possibility of different social contexts for information exchange. Vertical engraving sites around  the estuarine foreshores (in very public locations) were compared with open engraving sites on  the ridgelines (where it is assumed that the audience was more restricted).   The distribution of uncommon motifs is also explored. Rare motifs were thought to have the  best potential to demonstrate the influence of local (or even individual) stylistic traits. Rare motifs  33A qualitative approach to individual motifs (e.g. body proportions, angle of macropod’s tails, orientation of motif  and presence of eyes and other internal features, etc.) may also have revealed stylistic patterning. Given the lack of  success of this approach to demonstrating ethnicity on a limited scale (Smith 1983; and see Clegg 1981), and the  generalised outcome achieved by such an approach at a regional level (Franklin 1984), this additional type of analysis  was not attempted.  terra australis 27 251 </page> <page sequence="2"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange are swamped in large-scale analyses, and it was hoped that this type of analysis would provide  additional stylistic information. Whales, for instance demonstrate a fairly restricted geographic  range. This, however, could be an environmental range as much as a cultural one. Other motifs,  such  as  profile  people,  culture  heroes,  certain  material  objects  and  Complex-non-figuratives  (CXNF’s) were considered to be better gauges of cultural choices. The restricted distribution of  contact motifs is also discussed.  As well as the regionally based quantitative analyses, several geographically restricted  qualitative analyses of motif depiction and preference (Sackett’s ‘compositional features’) were  undertaken. Certain attributes on human figures (particularly gender and items of material culture),  CXNF’s and culture heroes are the focus of this analysis.  Defining a regional style: methodology The aim of these analyses was to provide a statistical description of each art component (i.e.  average assemblage size, motif frequencies etc.) and to determine the amount of variation within  the assemblages on the basis of multivariate analysis. The general approach described here was  used for both art components.    As with most exercises of quantification, logical steps are required to code the data so it  can be read by a computer, analysed and then interpreted. As well as logically ordering the data,  it is necessary to justify the selection of variables as meaningful and relevant to the questions  being asked. The classification and selection process was discussed fully in the original research  (McDonald 1994a: Appendix 1). The procedures followed in quantifying the two art components  can be broadly defined as:   identification of the sample;   selection of variables;   collection (counting) of variables for the sample;   input of counted information into a (computerised) data base;   selection/clumping of variables for analysis;   analysis of data base; and,   interpretation of analysis results. Having  identified  the  sample  (Chapter 5),  the  selection of variables  for analysis proceeded. A  motif classification was applied to both art components (these were fundamentally the same with  addition of several motifs for the more diverse shelter art component) and a taxonomy accounting  for technical variations for the shelter art sites (see McDonald 1994a: Appendix 1). Topographic,  grid reference and site association information for both site types was also collected (see McDonald  1994a: Appendices 5 and 6). Motif Variables While comparability between the two components was an overriding factor in the selection of motif  variables, it was recognised that inherent differences in the two components would necessitate  some variation in the motifs identified and counted.   The motif classification was initially devised for the Rock Art Project, specifically for the  engraved assemblage (McDonald 1985a). The field recording exercises undertaken in subsequent  stages of the Project revealed greater motif variability, particularly in the shelter art component  (McDonald 1987, 1990a) which necessitated two additional motif categories (hands and axes)  for both components, and the addition of two exclusive categories (hand stencil variations and  ‘other’) for the shelter art sample (see Tables 5.1 and 5.3, Chapter 5). terra australis 27 252 </page> <page sequence="3"> Chapter 11: Synchronic variation: Sydney Basin Counting Once the motif and technique classifications had been devised, counting proceeded34. The counted  data was initially recorded on accounting broadsheets. Each site had one column; variables were  recorded by row. As well as counting motif and technique variables, site card information (for  those sites not visited by me) provided the topographic and site association variables. AHIMS  (then NPWS) site identification was used for each site.    All data were analysed on the mainframe computer at the Australian National University.  Analyses Analysis commenced with the motif count information, i.e. the raw data which had been entered  into the computer. This involved the analysis of 27 engraved motif variables.   All data were put through a GENSTAT Correspondence Analysis (Version 3.1), designed  to investigate variance within large multivariate data populations (the multivariate analyses used  were defined and discussed in McDonald 1994a: Appendix 1). This method found that both art  components were largely homogeneous populations, which clustered tightly and showed no  underlying structure. The pattern of distribution, both for variables and sites, was affected largely  by the presence of a few outliers. The analysis was re-run removing the outliers, in an effort to  seek the underlying patterns within the greater data set. This was done a few times, until it became  clear that the method was imposing structure upon the data - in much the same way as a cluster  analysis.  Two further steps were taken in the treatment of the data. This involved clumping the motifs  and converting them to binary data. The motif taxonomies for both components were reduced to  seven variables (Table 11.1).   Converting to binary data was a simple  Table 11.1: engraving Sites. clumped motif process of using presence and absence rather  variables used in correspondence Analysis. than raw count data: if a variable was present  Variable No. Motif/Variable description it received a value of 1; if it was absent its  1 Anthropomorphic value was 0.

The advantage of this technique over  other multivariate tools is that the variables (i.e. motifs) which contribute to these groupings can  be identified. It is not so much the presence of individual motifs which creates the variance, but  the combination of variables (Baxter 1994, Benzecri 1992, Shennan 1988).    To  explore  the  geographic  variability within  this  assemblage,  first  a CA was  run  using  grid location as a factor. This revealed no internal groupings or structure, nor any strong positive  correlation between geography and motif. This result supported the absence of strong patterning  or major divisions within the assemblage.   34All sites including those which had been counted previously (McDonald 1985a) were recounted for this research.  terra australis 27 253 </page> <page sequence="4"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange  The data base for this component is too large for the plot of the site distribution to be  meaningfully interpreted (Figure 11.1). The results were thus replotted using subdivisions of the  data (Table 11.2: see McDonald 1994a: Appendix 7; Figures A7.1 - A7.7). These sub-plots are based  on exactly the same results, but the smaller sample sizes enabled more useful interpretation.   Analysis was undertaken on a variety of  scales. The first  analysis  involved an arbitrary  division of the sites into map sheet provenance. The data were subdivided into eight groups which  could be interpreted broadly on a geographic basis. The resultant groups were unequal in size,  indicating e the geographic biases of the sample (Table 11.2). While being arbitrary in terms of  archaeological context, this division of the data base gave control over north-south and east-west  clines in the data (see Figure 11.2; McDonald 1994a: Appendix 8).  A more detailed subdivision of the region’s data was contemplated, but given concerns  about the relevance of the documented linguistic boundaries (Chapter 3) and obvious sampling  issues (i.e. unequal sample sizes), division of the data into archaeologically meaningful zones was  a vexed question. To investigate possible cultural divisions across the region more closely, several  localised areas (with good sample sizes) were chosen to investigate linguistic boundaries.

The first component accounts for the greatest amount of variance in the data base  (Figure 11.2), and the scree slope plot (Wright 1992) demonstrates that this component describes  considerable structure in the data. Less variance is accounted for by the second component, and  the slope then tails off.  1 0.9 0.8 0.7 figure 11.2: engraving cA results:  0.6 plot of the latent roots indicating  0.5 that the variance in the data set is  0.4 well accounted for by the first two  0.3 0.2 components. 0.1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 While no major internal groupings were identified, certain sites were identified as outliers (Figure  11.1). The plot of the first two co-ordinates (Figure 11.3) reveals that three of the variables (2,  3 and 4) are good discriminators. In the first co-ordinate, marine animals (3) and birds (4) are  negatively correlated, while in the second co-ordinate, birds (3) are negatively correlated with  land animals (2). Thus sites which contain large numbers of bird motifs would have very few  marine depictions, while sites with a large number of land animals would contain small numbers  of bird depictions (and vice versa). Anthropomorphs are relatively weakly positioned on the first  co-ordinate, but have a relatively good discriminating effect on the second co-ordinate. Material  objects, tracks and ‘other’ motifs are poor discriminators being situated close to the origin.  The CA results reveal no evidence for strong or distinctive localised variability across  the region. Certain stylistic clines can be observed in the region’s subdivisions as shown by the  bivariate sub-plots (McDonald 1994a: Appendix 7: A7.1-A7.7) in terms of the distribution and/ or clustering of sites relative to the origin (i.e. X + Y = 0 on the bivariate plot). Sites close to the  origin are poorly discriminated by the axes in question and are stylistically homogenous. Those  site distributed away from the origin are well discriminated by their motif assemblage i.e. are  stylistically differently. ‘Common’ sites fall close to the origin; unique and/or more unusual sites  are located away from the origin. The identification and distribution of outlier sites in localised  areas (according to quadrants on the graph) is the key to investigating thematic variety across the  region.   The bivariate plots  for each group were analysed. The number of sites within a defined  and consistent radius of the origin was noted35, allowing for a calculation of the percentage of  ‘common’ and outlier sites in each area. This was necessary for comparability given the disparate  sample sizes. As the computer generated plots sometimes generated the two axes at different  scales, the radius is sometimes described by an ellipse rather than a circle. The distribution of  the outlier sites according to the four quadrants was also investigated (Figure 11.4). Variations  in the distribution of sites within the quadrants identified different compositional foci across the  region.    The sites in the north-west of the region were found to be relatively heterogeneous. Outlier  sites occurred predominantly (86%) on the positive side of the vertical axis, indicating that they  are more strongly  (and positively) discriminated by  the first component. Sites  in  these groups  contained many tracks (bird and macropod) as well as a definite preference for macropods and other  35This was drawn on each of the bivariate plots as a heuristic device.  terra australis 27 255 </page> <page sequence="6"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange 0.05 land animals, birds and anthropomorphs. 0.04 terrestrial  The large group of sites (234) in  the north-east of the Basin (north of the  0.03 Hawkesbury River) were more heavily  clustered around the origin (45%), while the  0.02 outliers showed a strong tendency (76%) to  be located on the positive side of the vertical  0.01 marine animals axis.

In another major cluster (of 25  sites) each contains a single macropod.    South of the Georges River, there was a marked increase in heterogeneity. South of Port  Hacking (group 8) the sites are well dispersed away from the origin (only 26.5% homogeneity).  These sites contain a predominance of marine depictions and other material objects. Some of  these sites included anthropomorphs; others included terrestrial animals and ‘other’ motifs. The  outlier sites in this group indicate a major difference from preceding groups in subject preference.  When the percentages of homogeneous sites across the region are compared (Figure 11.5), this  patterning is clear.   The most homogeneous assemblages are in the centre of the Sydney Basin (Groups 5 and  3). This homogeneity decreases as you moving north-west and south. Sites to the west of the  central core are also fairly homogeneous.   There was also marked variation in the distribution of outlier sites (compositional focus)  across the region. The emphasis on certain combinations of motifs varies across the region, and it  is the changes in these combinations that characterise the stylistic clines across the region. These  are sometimes explicable in terms of economic/geographic factors (e.g. proximity to the sea). Not  all variations, however, were so easily explained.  language Areas. Searching for boundaries and between-group distinctiveness Five language areas (following Capell 1970) are recognised to have existed within the study area at  European contact (chapter 3). These languages were mutually intelligible, although ethnohistoric  evidence suggests that the locations of neighbouring ‘tribal territories’ were recognised and  respected by the various groups. Anthropological work elsewhere on the continent suggests that  the boundaries between language groups would not have been impenetrable barriers. Such studies  terra australis 27 256 </page> <page sequence="7"> Chapter 11: Synchronic variation: Sydney Basin also suggest that such boundaries may have been fluid over time. The territorial distribution of the  contact languages may not have extended back more than a few generations.  figure 11.5: percentage of homogeneous engraving sites in each analytical Group. Archaeological evidence also casts uncertainty onto the longevity of these boundaries: the cultural  change which occurred  at  around 1,000 years BP  (with  the  introduction of fishhooks  and  the  decrease in the use of rockshelters) may be so significant that the contact language boundaries  are meaningless throughout the full extent of the region’s art’s production (i.e. the last 3-4,000  years).   Capell’s (1970) language group boundaries were major rivers and creeklines. I argue  (following Tindale 1974, Peterson 1976) that the boundary of any group’s range is more likely  to be at the periphery of its economically viable area. Boundaries in topographically dissected  areas (such as the Sydney Basin – as with the Pilbara) are likely to be along ridgelines. The ethno- historically reported use of ridgelines for access routes around the region supports this argument  since it is likely these would have traversed the periphery of any particular group’s territory – not  bisected the centre.   The model proposed in this thesis suggested that stylistic behaviour which reinforces group  distinctiveness should be observable on the basis of drainage basin catchments, with boundaries  between groups along ridgelines and not creeklines. The region was thus subdivided by means of  drainage basins.   Within  the five documented  language areas, 25 drainage basins were defined across  the  region.   As identified earlier, a potential problem with these analyses is the disparate sample sizes  (Table 11.3). This distribution of sites represents in part an archaeological ‘reality’ (Chapter 5),  with decreasing site numbers at the periphery of the Sydney Basin. This may in part reflect the  geological reality, although this has never been quantified. Much of the bias with this component  results from the geographic focus of certain recorders in locations closer to Sydney city (McDonald  1985a). Over 70% of this assemblage was recorded by W.D. Campbell, Fred McCarthy and Ian  Sim means that the distribution of this sample largely reflects their areas of interest and recording  terra australis 27 257 </page> <page sequence="8"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Table 11.3: language areas, codes and sample focus [Sim (1966a) represents the only focus  sizes. in the north-west of the Basin].

Guringai 2 434  Several systematic EIS surveys, in the  Sydney (Eora) 3 32 north and south of the region have revealed  Dharug 4 49 a relatively low number and density of  Tharawal 5 52 engraving sites. Likely explanations for this  could be geological or cultural. In the Mill  Creek valley (south of the Georges River), the  ridgelines on either side of the drainage basin are characterised by shale laterite, some of which  had been extensively mined by the local Municipal Council for road construction (Attenbrow and  Negerevich 1981; McDonald 1990b). Systematic survey here (covering c. 45 sq km) revealed  only one engraving site.   In the north of the region, the Mangrove Creek valley, both in its upper catchment and  its middle reaches around Warre Warren Creek, has been systematically sampled over an area  of approximately 200 sq km (Attenbrow 1981, McDonald 1988a). Engraving sites here were  relatively few (n=4: 3% of recorded sites) although large numbers of suitable rock surfaces were  located and inspected. These results are in stark contrast with those achieved at Maroota south of  the Hawkesbury River in the central-west of the Basin, where 12 engraving sites were located in  one square kilometre (McDonald 1986a).    A correlation of sample size with  language area and motif categories was made (Figure  11.6), to determine whether patterning in these analyses results from sampling inequities (James  1993).  450 figure 11.6: Bivariate plot of  400 sample size and number of  350 300 motifs recorded per sample  250 area.

Further, the Guringai  sites were subdivided into random 50 and 100 site samples, for the comparison of assemblage  composition (and CA results) according to language area. These different steps indicate that the  unavoidable sampling inequities in the data base do not appear to produce significant interpretive  issues.   Motif Assemblage Differences across the Basin Before analysing the CA results, basic assemblage details were investigated for each of the  language areas. The division of the sites into language area was based on Capell’s (1970) defined  boundaries (see Figure 3.1).    terra australis 27 258 Sample size (No of siites) </page> <page sequence="9"> Chapter 11: Synchronic variation: Sydney Basin Darkingung This area had 2,127 motifs (1,803 recognisable) from 137 sites. Two of the region’s four largest  sites (&gt;100 motifs) are found in this area, and average site size is 15.5 motifs/site. The motif focus  here is on tracks (bird, human and roo’s respectively). The macropod is the next most common  motif. Whale motifs are not represented in this assemblage.   Men  are  the  most  commonly  depicted  human  figures,  followed  by  non-gendered  anthropomorphs. Profile depictions are quite common. Relatively few (six only) culture heroes are  found here. Boomerangs are the most commonly depicted material culture items (Figure 11.7).  Darug This inland area has less of a focus on tracks than its more northerly counterpart. Mundoes and  bird tracks still figure strongly, but macropods and land animals represent a large component of  this assemblage  (Figure 11.8). Human figures are again  focused on males, and here  there  is a  greater emphasis on profile figures than non-gendered anthropomorphs. Three culture heroes (at  two sites) are located in this area. The average site size here is eight motifs/site.  Guringai This sample is located on the coast and represents the largest sample in the region. The 434 sites  in this area produced 4,699 motifs. The average site size is 11 motifs/site. The other two sites with  &gt;100 motifs are located in this language area.  To examine the effect of sample size, two random sub-samples were generated (one with 50;  the other with 100 sites) to see what effect this may have on the results (Figure 11.9). All three  histograms reveal the same focus on mundoes and fish, followed by macropods, other land animals  and men. While the peaks and troughs of these graphs vary slightly according to sample size, the  results are basically the same. Only the sample of 50 resulted in a reduction of motif variables (roo  tracks and contact motifs). These were two of the least common motif types in the total sample.  While this sample is located on the coast, its motif focus is not entirely explicable in terms of  environment (cf. the Sydney group).  Sydney (Eora) This language group is located on the coast, south of Port Jackson and north of the Georges River.  This has the smallest sample size (due partly to the focus of European settlement, but also because  the Cumberland Plain comprises a large proportion of this area).   The 32 sites in this area produced 245 motifs (an average of eight motifs/site). The motif  focus in this area is on fish (46%), with whales and other marine animals also common (Figure  11.10). The reduced motif classification here possibly is a result of sample size. Tharawal This area is also located on the coastal strip, but south of the Georges River. A sample here again  was small with 245 motifs recorded at 51 sites. The assemblage sizes here (on average) are the  smallest recorded in the Basin (5 motifs/site). There is a focus on marine depictions (30.7%), but  the most commonly depicted motifs are men and non-gendered anthropomorphs (20.3% in total).  Macropods and land animals are also common, while mundoes are the most frequently depicted  tracks (Figure 11.11).  terra australis 27 259 </page> <page sequence="10"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange figure 11.7: darkingung language Area. motif Assemblage. figure 11.8: darug language Area. motif Assemblage. terra australis 27 260 </page> <page sequence="11"> Chapter 11: Synchronic variation: Sydney Basin figure 11.9: Guringai language Area. motif assemblage. terra australis 27 261 </page> <page sequence="12"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange figure 11.10: Sydney  (Eora) Area: Motif  Assemblage.  figure 11.11: Tharawal  Area: motif Assemblage.  Summary Site size and motif focus vary across the region. While some of these trends are environmental;  i.e. more fish and marine depictions on the coast and higher proportions of land animals inland,  there are other foci which cannot be explained so simply. There are varying proportions of animal  and human tracks in different parts of the region, and a dominance of human figures in coastal  sites south of the Georges River:   The Darkingung sites are generally large with several very large sites found along access  routes. The density of sites appears lower than in other areas although average assemblage size is  higher. The motif focus is on kangaroo, bird and human tracks and macropods.  The average Darug site size is roughly half that found in the Darkingung language area.  Macropods and other land animals dominate this assemblage, but tracks appear less important.   The Guringai area has the largest number of sites and seems to represent the region’s  core engraving assemblage. Average site size is larger than Darug but smaller than Darkingung.  Dominant motifs are mundoes and fish, followed by macropods, other land animals, and men.   Only a few sites have been recorded from the Eora area, and these are relatively small. The  motif focus here is on fish, mundoes, whales and other marine animals.   The Tharawal engraving assemblages are the smallest on average. The focus here is on  men, other marine depictions, and fish, followed by macropods and other land animals.  terra australis 27 262 </page> <page sequence="13"> Chapter 11: Synchronic variation: Sydney Basin correspondence Analysis and language Areas While trends in the motif assemblages across the Basin are quite clear, the CA results help  determine compositional differences and foci in the different areas, and to demonstrate internal  variability in the regional assemblage. The language areas were analysed as were drainage basins.  This work also tested several of Capell’s boundaries along creeklines.  Drainage Basins A total of 25 drainage basins were defined across the region (Figure 11.12; Table 11.4). These  vary considerably in size and very large drainage areas have been defined for areas with low site  numbers (e.g. Blue Mountains and Colo). Not all basins have engraving sites; some contain only  shelter art sites (chapter 12).   Because of the disparate sample sizes, language boundaries and drainage basin boundaries  were investigated in three locations with good sample sizes of both site types. These analyses  tested the possibility of language boundaries and explored the degree of intra-language area  patterning. The areas tested were:  1) Drainage basins 1, 5 and 6 within the Darkingung language area, north of the Hawkesbury  River (107 sites);  2) Drainage basins 10-13 to test east-west patterning across the purported Guringai/Darug  language boundary, south of the Hawkesbury River (316 sites);   and,     3) Drainage basins 18 – 21 to test east-west patterning across the purported Tharawal/ Darug language boundary, south of the Georges River (51 sites). In the first two of these areas, extensive rock art recording work has been completed (Gunn 1979;  McCarthy (see references); McDonald 1986a, 1987, 1988a, 1990a; Sim 1963a, b, 1966a, b; Smith  1983; Vinnicombe 1980) as were the four excavations completed for this research. The third area  has been studied in more detail by other researchers (Officer 1984, Sefton 1988, SPG 1974) and  although a smaller sample, this was seen as a useful test area south of the Georges River style  boundary. CA according to drainage basins This analysis viewed sites according to language areas and drainage basins36 (Figure 11.12). The  seven clumped motif classes were again used here (i.e. ‘anthropomorphs’ include men, women,  non-gendered and profile anthropomorphic figures and culture heroes). Detail on thematic focus  results from re-inspection of the site recordings. 1) Darkingung language group (drainage basins 1, 5 and 6).  This group of 107 sites is located north of the Hawkesbury River and includes the major drainage  basins of the Macdonald River and Mangrove Creek. The Upper Macdonald and Central  Macdonald groups were divided at the Bala Range, a geographic barrier at the centre of the valley.  Drainage Basin 4 was excluded here as it contained only one site (although now see Taçon et al.  2005, 2006).   36All plots are based on the same CA results which are sorted according to location (language area, drainage basin,  etc.). The plots have a manually drawn circle or ellipse (depending on the scale of the axes) indicating the arbitrary  cut-off for the homogenous ‘zone’. This procedure provides a visual aid in the interpretation of the bivariate plots.  NB.

Both  banks of this estuarine waterway were surveyed during the Rock Art Project (McDonald 1990b).  Vertical engravings were located on both banks of this creek, and the art on both sides (within 40m  distance and 10m elevation) was observed to be very similar. This analysis tested the Berowra  Creek boundary and found that the sites on either site of the creek do demonstrate differences.  terra australis 27 266 </page> <page sequence="17"> Chapter 11: Synchronic variation: Sydney Basin DaruG       Outliers       Core: 35% 18.2%  45.5%                      13.6%  22.7% GurinGai       Outliers       Core: 45% 27%  19%                        16%  38% The 34 Darug sites are less homogeneous than the 182 Guringai sites.

Bivariate plot of cA Scores. Conclusions The Darkingung and Guringai language areas have the most homogenous engraving assemblages,  followed by the engraved Darug assemblage. The engravings in the Tharawal language area are  the least homogenous.   Internal variations across the Darkingung language area are relatively small. The upper and  central Macdonald River sites are similar in terms of homogeneity and outlier focus (tracks). These  sites are, however, different from the Mangrove Creek sites: which are slightly less homogenous  and have a focus on terrestrial animals.   The Darug sites are more heterogeneous than either the Darkingung or the Guringai sites.  Capell’s language boundary along Berowra Creek is supported by this analysis. There are marked  differences in the levels of variability, and dissimilar motif preferences.   The Guringai area is relatively homogenous, but there is still evidence for localised  variability here. The Cowan sites are less homogenous than those from the Pittwater sample.  The drainage basin analysis in this central part of the region demonstrates a clinal increase in  variability as one moves west away from the coast.   The Mangrove Creek sites appear to be most like the Darug sites. Both groups are less  homogenous than the Darkingung and Guringai sites generally. All three sets of sites, however,  have different motif foci.   The Tharawal sites are markedly dissimilar to all other language groups. The sites are  considerably more heterogeneous and the outlier foci are different. Comparison of two drainage  basins with reasonable samples within this language area suggests differences between coastal  and more inland sub-groups. While having different outlier foci, these two groups demonstrate  the most variance of all groups analysed.    These  analyses  demonstrate  a  complex  network  of  stylistic  variability  as  defined  by  engraved motif preference across the region. Several contact language boundaries are supported  terra australis 27 271 </page> <page sequence="22"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange by these analyses: the east-west Guringai-Darug boundary and the northern Tharawal boundary.  Sites within the Darkingung language area, however, show some variability: with sites from  Mangrove Creek more like those from the Darug language area.   This patterning is discussed after compositional features and the distribution of rare motifs  are described.  ridge top versus vertical engraving sites This research has identified a number of vertical engraving sites around the foreshores of Broken  Bay and its main estuarine tributaries (Figure 11.19). The ethnohistoric literature indicates that  this zone as a highly public one, and the sort of location where stylistic bounding behaviour is  likely to be demonstrated (Wiessner 1990).   On the ridgelines and plateaux above these waterways are vast numbers of open engraving  sites. The art sites at the bottom of cliffs and steep hillslopes provide a different social context  from the open engraving sites on the less (economically) productive plateaux above. The sites  close to the estuarine resources would have been accessed either by canoe or on foot around the  foreshore (Figure 11.20, Figure 11.21).  figure 11.19: Two examples of vertical  engraving sites from Berowra creek  (top) and Cowan Creek (bottom). Note  the complexity of composition and  shared line designs.  Many of the ridgelines around the region are documented access routes (e.g. the Boree Track,  Kulnura Ridge). Sites in these locations will provide a different kind of information, one which  promotes social cohesion. Any sites which had ritual significance are also  likely  to have been  located away from the main centres of subsistence economy in any particular social group’s  territory.  Analysis was undertaken in the Guringai language area (Cowan and Berowra drainage  basins), comparing the ridgetop, hillside and valley bottom engraving sites. This area was selected  because of the large sample of engraving sites generally, and because many vertical engraving  sites have been found here too. Motifs were compared (Figure 11.22), and the CA results were  re-sorted to determine the varying degrees of homogeneity of these locations. Hillside sites were  included as these locations include a high number of the engraving sites.  There are 78 sites in ridgetop locations in this area. The average site size is 12 motifs/site.  The average distance to permanent drinking water from these sites is 570m. The predominant  motif in these locations is the mundoe  (c.35%),  followed  by  fish  (15%)  and  men  (8%).  terra australis 27 272 </page> <page sequence="23"> Chapter 11: Synchronic variation: Sydney Basin Figure 11.20: Smith’s Creek, Ku-Ring-Gai Chase National Park.

In the 63 hillslope sites the predominant motif is the fish (15%) followed by mundoes (12.5%),  other land animals (9%), men and boomerangs (c.8%), macropods and shields (c.7%). The average  distance to permanent drinking water from these sites is 460m.   There are 14 vertical engraving sites and these are generally smaller assemblages (av.  7.5 motifs/site). The average distance to drinking water from these sites is greater than from  either of the other locations, for, while these are located next to the water’s edge, Berowra and  Cowan Creeks are saline and tidal. Fish motifs predominate (35%) in these locations, followed  by macropods (15%). Missing motif classes include culture heroes, circles and contact motifs.  Mundoes are present in a very small number of these sites (c.2%).   The differences in motif preferences on ridgetop and hill side locations are quite striking  and cannot be explained in terms of sampling (Figure 11.22). The CA results reinforce engraving  site differences in these landscapes (Figure 11.23).  ridgetops       Outliers       Core: 45% 26.2%  21.4%                     9.5%  42.9% terra australis 27 274 </page> <page sequence="25"> Chapter 11: Synchronic variation: Sydney Basin This group is quite homogeneous, with its outlier focus in quadrant C.

The sites on the ridgetops and hillslopes are more homogenous than those around the  water’s edge. While there are demonstrated differences in degrees of homogeneity, however, the  outlier foci in these three locations are very similar. In other words, the graphic vocabulary of  people operating in these different landscapes, is the same. This result is as would be expected  within the one language area and suggests that these sites being used by the same group(s) of  people in a range of different social or information contexts.  rare motifs Rare and unique motifs were analysed to establish their geographic distributions. It was hoped  that this type of investigation would elucidate localised stylistic traits. Analysis concentrated on  non-economic motifs in an effort to reduce environmental influences.   The analysis of how many times an individual motif occurred at any engraving site in the  region demonstrated some interesting results (Table 11.5; Figure 11.24).    The motifs which occur at  the most sites  in  the  region are fish and macropods  (c.35%)  followed by men and other land animals. Mundoes – while the most numerous engraved motif in  the region - are only present at 22% of engraving sites. This result indicates that certain motifs are  concentrated in a few sites - while other motifs are more widely dispersed (relatively fewer motifs  are placed on many more sites).  This analysis focussed on concentrated rare motifs (i.e. ones  which are relatively rare and which occur on few sites), and on dispersed motifs (i.e. relatively  rare but fairly widely distributed).    The distribution of these motifs was plotted (Figure 11.25 to Figure 11.28), the percentages  of sites with each motif type were calculated by language area (Table 11.6). These results were  compared with the percentage results for each language area so that relative significance could be  determined. To test the statistical significance of these differences, an approximate randomisation  method (Noreen 1989, Wright 1991) was used on the figures (see Table 11.7).  terra australis 27 275 </page> <page sequence="26"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange figure 11.23: cA  bivariate plots according  to topographic location.

This will be discussed further below. composition Difference in composition were explored to provide further evidence of the types of cultural and/ or stylistic choices (Sackett 1990) being made across the region. Shields and culture heroes were  selected for this analysis.   Shields Previous archaeological analyses of shield designs have demonstrated stylistic patterning  explicable in terms of trade and overall alliance systems (Dickens 1992, Hatte 1992; Morwood  1987). Local ethnohistoric evidence suggested that this motif type may provide ethnically- sensitive patterning, with commentators stating that the coastal peoples from around Sydney  and further north carried distinctively patterned shields (Bellinghausen and Rossiyisky in Barratt  1981; Enright 1900; Threlkeld in Gunson 1974). It was hoped that patterning in shield design  distributions may indicate an interrelatedness of contact around the region.    Threlkeld described the construction of the region’s wooden shields from around the Lake  Macquarie area (Awabakal/Guringai language areas). These were: three feet long by eighteen inches ... lozenge shaped, pointed at top and bottom, and pigeon  breasted  rather  than  flat.  ...  The  shields  are  always  painted  with  white  pipeclay  and  are  generally ornamented with a St George’s Cross, formed by two bands two or three inches  wide, one vertical the other horizontal, coloured red ... [Gunson 1974:68].  Rossiyisky describes the wooden shields from the Sydney area similarly, although observing  that ‘they are daubed with various red and white figures’ [(in) Barratt 1981:23, emphasis mine].  Bellinghausen’s description confirms  the  colour usage as  ‘dry white  colouring  substance over  which was painted red stripes’ (in Barratt 1981:41; and see Enright 1900; Cave in Brayshaw  1986).  The engraved shields are fairly rare (232 total: 3% of the assemblage) and they are quite  dispersed (found at 103 sites; 14%). A few sites have concentrations of this motif type: site#  45-3-376 has 23 shields; #45-6-705 has 15 (Figure 11.29). Most sites have one or two shields  (average is 2 shields/site). These motifs are usually found on moderately large sites (average  assemblage size = 22 motifs/site). The shield from one site (#45-6-689) was excluded as the motif  was incomplete. The sample for this analysis came from 102 sites.  terra australis 27 278 </page> <page sequence="29"> Chapter 11: Synchronic variation: Sydney Basin Figure 11.25: Distribution of sites with engraved women and profile people. terra australis 27 279 </page> <page sequence="30"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange figure 11.26: distribution of engraving sites with culture heroes and shield motifs. terra australis 27 280 </page> <page sequence="31"> Chapter 11: Synchronic variation: Sydney Basin figure 11.27: distribution of sites with engraved axe and macropod tracks. terra australis 27 281 </page> <page sequence="32"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Figure 11.28: Distribution of engraving sites with complex-non-figurative and contact  motifs.  terra australis 27 282 </page> <page sequence="33"> Chapter 11: Synchronic variation: Sydney Basin Figure 11.29: Site 575 (NPWS # 45-6-705) with 15 shield motifs and three boomerangs.

Analysis revealed this to be considerably  greater than suggested by Threlkeld’s description. Twenty-six design categories (including  undecorated) were identified (Figure 11.30). The designs consist mainly of horizontal and vertical  line variations. A significant design element is a diamond shaped component at either or both of  the shield’s pointed end(s).   There are several unique varieties (designs 6 A-C) which are variations on design themes  2B and 2C. Two of these appear to be shields punctured by many spears (see Megaw 1993).   The two sites with multiple shield motifs (#’s 45-3-376, 45-6-705) are separated by  considerable distance. One is north of the Hawkesbury River (Mangrove Creek drainage basin),  the other  is  at Mosman  (Middle Harbour drainage basin: Figure 11.31). The Darkingung site  includes only design varieties 1, 2B and 2C. The Guringai site has seven design types (4A, 4D,  4E, 4F, 5B, 5E, and 2C) most of which have the diamond point decorative element at one or both  ends.    First,  sites with only a single design  type present were analysed.  It was hoped  that  this  would facilitate clear focus on localised patterning in the design elements and reduce synchronic  ‘noise’. Threlkeld’s description suggested that the ‘St George cross’ form (2B) would be the most  common. This was not the case. Sites with multiple design types were excluded from this initial  sort. Four major design themes were identified and these account for 62% of the sites with shields  (Table 11.8).  Table 11.8: engraved sites.

Plain shields, as might be expected, are ubiquitous. They occur on both sides of the Hawkesbury  River in Guringai, Darkingung, Darug and Tharawal sites. The distribution of the St George cross  design (2B) was quite restricted. With the exception of one Darkingung site west of Mangrove  Creek (on Flat Rocks Ridge), this design is confined to the Cowan, Pittwater and (particularly)  Middle Harbour drainage basins: all Guringai language areas.  The double (horizontal) cross design (2C) is the most common design in the region. It  occurs at 28 sites (in isolation) and at another 13 sites in combination with a variety of design  forms. It occurs in Guringai, Darkingung and Darug areas.   The design with diamond elements at either end of the shield has a very restricted  distribution. The eleven sites with this design element (in isolation) occur only in the Guringai  area, in the Cowan and Middle Harbour drainage basins.   The two designs which appear to have the most potential for indicating inter- and intra- language contact were the St George (2B) variety and the diamond-end varieties (design types 4  and 5), both of which are restricted predominantly to the Guringai area. Next the distribution of  these design elements in sites with combination shield designs was analysed. Again, a restricted  distribution was found (Table 11.9). More than 90% of the sites with these designs were in the  Guringai area, with the Cowan and Middle Harbour catchments containing 68% of these sites.  Shield designs exhibit highly localised characteristics. The Guringai language area contains  the largest number of shields in the region and exhibits the greatest degree of design variability.  There are localised design traits within this area. Cowan and Middle Harbour catchments  contain the most shields and this is the design focus for both the diamond infill and double-cross  varieties. terra australis 27 284 </page> <page sequence="35"> Chapter 11: Synchronic variation: Sydney Basin   figure 11.31: distribution map of main shield designs.

Culture Heroes At 29 sites across the region there are 36 culture heroes (Table 11.10). This motif differs from  ordinary anthropomorphs on the basis of extreme size (mean length is 5.2m; standard deviation  = 1.4m) and by the amount of infilled decoration. Some of these motifs are therianthropes (Flood  1987; McDonald and Veth 2006b) with animal features including bird’s and/or snake’s heads.  The two main forms of culture hero are the ‘Daramulan’ type (partially or fully in profile) and  the ‘Biaime’ type (in plan, with limbs akimbo). These types were named by McCarthy (1959a;  following Mathews 1904, and see Clegg 1981) and a more recent analysis (Higgs 2003) has  explored attribute variability in these motif forms.  A feature of this motif form suggests its cultural importance - or at least its continuation  of use over time: evidence for multiple episode of engraving. More than half of these motifs  have added features or altered outlines. The Daramulan figures appear particularly susceptible to  change: many having a second leg added, and sometimes an arm or extra penis (Figure 11.33).   These motifs occur amongst a range of assemblage sizes. Some sites are extremely large  (97 motifs), but there are also isolated examples e.g. with only a single culture hero present. The  average size of sites with this motif present is 25.4 motifs/site. The average distance to drinking  water from sites with these motifs is c.500m.   As indicated above, this motif is restricted to the Guringai (75%), Darug (8.3%) and  Darkingung (16.7%) language areas. Almost half of the motifs in the Guringai area are located in  the Cowan drainage basin (Table 11.11).   Most of these motifs occur singly at sites, but are often paired. Some of these pairings  are clearly male/female; others are male/male. Some sites include paired and/or transitional  Daramulan and Biaime types (Figure 11.34).  The Daramulan type is heavily focussed (86%) in the Guringai area, while the Biaime  form is distributed more widely (still 67% Guringai). The two Daramulan-type culture heroes  located outside the Guringai area occur on major engraving sites (Devil’s Rock Maroota, Flat  Rocks Ridge) in places which could be argued are aggregation locales (Conkey 1980) - or at least  on access routes where groups cohesion is being demonstrated.

A similar pattern was demonstrated by the shields. The distribution of these same motifs in  the shelter art component is compared below, to determine whether these patterns hold for both  media. terra australis 27 287 </page> <page sequence="38"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Table 11.11: daramulan and Biaime types, language areas and drainage basins.

This is distinctive only in the south of the Basin, where the previously  identified style boundary of the Georges River is confirmed. In most parts of the region stylistic  variation is clinal. It can be explained in terms of defined language areas, and can also be identified  as localised variability based on drainage basins.   The Darkingung and Guringai language areas have the most homogenous engraving  assemblages closely followed by the Darug. The engravings in the Tharawal area are the least  homogenous. The Guringai sites consistently demonstrate the highest levels of homogeneity, but  also provide evidence for internal variability: the Cowan sites are less homogenous than those  from the Pittwater drainage basin. In this central part of the region there is a clinal increase in  variability as one moves west, away from the coast. terra australis 27 289 </page> <page sequence="40"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange figure 11.34: paired and/or transitional Daramulan and Biaime motifs. note that Daramulan  below (on #45-2-16) has an altered outline also (top; from McCarthy and Hansen 1960:  Figure 1; bottom; from McDonald 1986a: Figures 3 and 8). terra australis 27 290 </page> <page sequence="41"> Chapter 11: Synchronic variation: Sydney Basin  Analysis of the Tharawal sites reveals an assemblage which dissimilar from all others. The  sites are significantly more heterogeneous and the outlier foci indicate a different thematic focus.  Comparison of the two drainage basins with good samples here suggests differences between the  coastal and more inland sub-groups.    The  results  demonstrate  a  complex  network  of  stylistic  variability  as  defined  by motif  preference. In some language areas, sites show levels of internal cohesion. Several of the proposed  language boundaries are supported by these analyses. Berowra Creek could be the boundary  between the Darug and Guringai groups – the art on either sides of this showing varying design  focus. The northern boundary for Tharawal is also supported by these analyses with the identified  style boundary at the Georges River.     The analysis of rare motifs confirms the localised character of engraving themes around  the Basin. Culture heroes are focussed in the western part of the Guringai territory and reveal a  design link with the Darkingung - confirming the CA results.   The study of composition on several rare motifs also revealed design contact between  Guringai, Darkingung and Darug language areas. The source of this contact appears to stem  from the Guringai. Design variability on shield motifs is extraordinarily diverse in the Guringai  area, with both less motifs and a marked decrease in design options being practised outside this  language area. These results will be discussed further in chapter 13.  terra australis 27 291 </page> </plain_text>
