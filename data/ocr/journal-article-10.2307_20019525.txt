PROVIDENCE AND EVIL The last two decades have seen an unprecedented amount of philosophical work on the topics of divine foreknowledge, middle knowledge, and timeless? ness in relation to human freedom. Most of this effort has been directed at logical and metaphysical aspects of these topics - the compatibility of fore? knowledge with free will, the existence of true counterfactuals of freedom and the possibility of middle knowledge, the conceivability and metaphysical possibility of divine timelessness, and so on. Far less attention, in contrast, has been devoted to the broader theological ramifications of these theories. Yet insofar as they are theological theories, they are properly appreciated and indeed fully understood only when placed in the appropriate theological context. It is my aim in this essay to contribute to this latter project by exploring the conceptions of divine providence which emerge from various views con? cerning 'God, time, and knowledge'. I shall identify three main conceptions of providence which emerge as leading contenders, and explore briefly the resources afforded by each theory for the divine providential governance of the world. Then I shall consider each of the three theories in the light of two aspects of divine activity in the world - God's dealings with evil, as con? sidered under the head of theodicy, and the interpersonal relationship be? tween God and human beings, conceived as divine-human dialogue. Why dialogue and theodicy, in preference to other topics that might have been selected ? The theme of divine?human dialogue is in some respects a peculiarly modern conception, informed as it is by Buber's / and Thou and, going farther back, by Kant's insistence on the unique worth of persons as such. It captures in a powerful way the idea that God, himself the supremely personal being, relates personally to human beings in a way that both respects and enhances their personhood. In another sense, of course, the notion of divine-human dialogue is anything but modern, going back as it does to the earliest strata of the Old Testament. Whatever one's final verdict on this notion - I have heard it criticized as ' anthropomorphic ' - its hold on the religious life and imagination of a great many people is sufficient justi? fication for considering it here. It is hardly necessary to argue for the importance of the problem of evil,</page><page sequence="2">92 WILLIAM HASKER which is both the strongest argument against the existence of God and one of the very few topics which can be guaranteed to hold the attention alike of professional philosophers and introductory students. To be sure, much of the recent attention to this topic has been devoted to c defence ' rather than 'theodicy'. But I believe it is becoming increasingly clear that a satisfying response to this problem requires some sort of positive account of God's reasons for permitting the evils which exist in the world.1 My project in this paper is not to construct a theodicy or even primarily to assess those which have already been proposed. Rather, I wish to explore the important ways in which theodicies depend on our general assumptions concerning the nature of divine power and knowledge - concerning, as we may say, the ' resources ' with which God operates in shaping the world to his purposes. A dramatic example of this is found in process theodicy, which succeeds in greatly reducing the extent of God's responsibility for the evil in the world by imposing strong limitations on divine power. The price paid may be a heavy one, but the exoneration of God from complicity in evil is viewed, not unreasonably, as a major strength of process theism. In the present essay I shall not, however, be addressing process theism; rather, my 'three theories' represent approaches consistent with the broad tradition of Christian orthodoxy, understood in terms of the Nicene Creed.2 The three approaches to be considered may be designated as Calvinism, Molinism, and Free Will Theism.3 For each theory, I shall first set out its account of divine power and knowledge as exercised in providential govern? ance, then I shall comment on its resources for dealing with the problem of evil, and finally I shall discuss the theory's stance with regard to divine human dialogue. II. CALVINISM My use of the term ' Calvinism ' is in no way historically exact ; it is meant as a shorthand to embrace all those views which give a fundamentally deterministic account of the divine-human relationship. Thus, my 'Calvin? ists' include not only Calvin, Luther, and Jonathan Edwards, but also Ba?ez, 1 At least, of God's possible reasons ; certainly any theist is well advised to leave open the possibility that God may have other and better reasons for what he does than any we have been able to think of. For an outstanding selection of recent work on the problem, one which I think supports the general? ization given in the text, see Marilyn M. Adams and Robert M. Adams, eds., The Problem of Evil (Oxford : Oxford University Press, 1990). 2 Those who define orthodoxy more narrowly - say, in terms of agreement with a consensus of major medieval theologians - may not be disposed to regard all of my three theories as orthodox. This raises major questions which cannot be pursued here. I do not believe, however, that these more restrictive conceptions have a good claim to the title of Christian orthodoxy - as opposed, for example, to ' high medieval' orthodoxy. 3 For a finely detailed account of the first two of these as they have been discussed in the Roman Catholic context, see Thomas Flint, 'Two Accounts of Providence', in Thomas V. Morris, ed., Divine and Human Action: Essays in the Metaphysics of Theism (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1988), pp. 147-81.</page><page sequence="3">PROVIDENCE AND EVIL 93 Aquinas, and the later Augustine. I would acknowledge, furthermore, that in some (perhaps in all) of these theologians there are elements which seek to qualify the theological determinism I am taking as the hallmark of 'Calvinism', and may even be inconsistent with it. Our focus, then, will be on theological determinism as such and not on the particular ways in which this has worked itself out in the thought of this or that theologian. Clearly, the divine 'resources' for controlling the creation are for Calvinism as great as is logically possible. God can create anything whose existence is logically compatible with his own nature. And inasmuch as God knows both his own intentions to create and the infallible efficacy of those intentions, there is no difficulty whatever in understanding God's compre? hensive and total knowledge of his creation. The majesty of divine sover? eignty thus exhibited has been and remains a central basis for Calvinism's appeal. It is fairly clear, on the other hand, that the problem of accounting for the world's evil represents an area of difficulty for Calvinism - sufficiently so that most of those who place a high priority on the construction of a plausible and satisfying theodicy will not find a Calvinist account of divine providence attractive. Indeed, Calvinism would seem to be threatened by a deep in? coherence in its account specifically of moral evil. God is wholly good; everything which occurs God has willed to occur in preference to any other logically possible state of affairs God might have chosen. And then a just and loving God assumes toward part of what he himself has chosen to create and bring about - namely, sin and moral evil - an attitude of utter, implacable hostility. So, at any rate, the Calvinist must hold - but is such a tale as this even coherent, let alone plausible?4 It may be of interest in this connection to consider Paul Helm's response to Anthony Kenny's claim that if determinism is true God is the author of sin. Consider, for example, Hitler's action in ordering the Holocaust. Is God responsible for this? Helm admits that (8) Any agent who freely and knowingly sets up a deterministic process with a certain outcome must be responsible for that outcome.5 But, Helm continues, a deterministic theist (i.e. a Calvinist) such as Helm 'will hardly have his feathers ruffled by (8) '. He goes on to say, 'Under such a system, that moral evil happened is certainly the responsibility of God, but not the doing of the evil'.6 What can we make of this? God is not responsible for ordering the Holocaust, because God did not order the Holocaust. But God is responsible 4 For some attempts to deal with these issues on the basis of Calvinism, see John S. Feinberg, Theologies and Evil (Washington, D.C. : University Press of America, 1979), and Kathryn Tanner, 'God's Uncon? ditional Efficacy and Human Freedom to do Otherwise' (forthcoming). 5 Paul Helm, Eternal God (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988), p. 162. 6 Ibid.</page><page sequence="4">94 WILLIAM HASKER for Hitler's having ordered the Holocaust, and also for the Holocaust's having occurred, since each of these is the outcome of a deterministic process freely and knowingly set up by God. Just how Helm's answer clears God from the taint of moral evil is nowhere explained by Helm. But in any case, my argument is not that, given Calvinism, God is morally guilty for the world's sins, but rather that, given Calvinism, it is unintelligible to suppose God to be so utterly, implacably opposed to moral evil as the Scriptures represent him as being.7 (Perhaps it's not so much that God is not as good as we had supposed, as that the Holocaust is not as bad as we had supposed.) Calvinists seem not to devote a great deal of theological reflection to the topic of divine-human dialogue; a Calvinist may engage in dialogue with her God but is less likely to write an article about it. And this may not be accidental, for there is reason to suppose that Calvinism leaves us in deep trouble with regard to giving a plausible account of such dialogue. William Alston makes the point sharply : ' Dialogue requires two independent partici? pants, neither of which wholly controls the responses of the other. There is no genuine communication between Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy. '8 He considers the objection that in this example 'the trouble lies in the lack of complexity of one partner, rather than in his total subservience to the other', and so he proposes another example: Consider a 'conversation' between hypnotist and subject, in which the latter is doing nothing but carrying out posthypnotic suggestions... Here the one party, the hyp? notist, really is effectively deciding just what the other says, and the other is as complicated as a human being, in fact is a human being. Here we have as close an analogy to divine omnidetermination as we are likely to find, and the verdict, I suppose, would be clear. This is a charade, not a genuine case of communication.9 Clearly there is far more to be said about the different varieties of Calvinism than I have said here. But insofar as one's philosophical priorities include an effective response to the problem of evil and/or a plausible, intuitively satisfying account of divine-human dialogue, I believe that Calvinism will not present itself as an attractive option. III. MOLINISM Compared with 'Calvinism', my use of 'Molinism' is fairly precise in its historical reference ; it designates the theory of ' middle knowledge ' devel? oped by the sixteenth-century Jesuit theologian Luis de Molina, which is currently enjoying a modest resurgence among analytical philosophers of 7 See for example Romans chs. 1-3. 8 'Divine-Human Dialogue and the Nature of God', in Divine Nature and Human Language (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1989), p. 148. 9 Ibid. p. 149.</page><page sequence="5">PROVIDENCE AND EVIL 95 religion.10 As is well known, Molina's theory hinges on certain propositions currently known as 'counterfactuals of freedom', propositions which specify concerning every actual or possible created free agent11 what that agent would freely choose to do in any possible choice situation12 in which she might find herself. Molinism initially presents itself as an answer to what Freddoso has called the ' source-question ' about foreknowledge, the question ' What is the source of and explanation for the fact that God knows future contingents with certainty?'13 The answer is that God, in consequence of knowing his own creative intentions, knows which free creatures he will create and which choices they will be called upon to make. And in virtue of his knowledge of the relevant counterfactuals of freedom, he also knows which particular choices will be made in each such situation, thus enabling him to know the future in its totality. But while all this is true, Molinism is gravely underestimated if one views it only as an answer to the source-question. On the contrary, Molinism lends itself to an extremely strong view of divine providence; in all likelihood, the strongest view possible if Calvinism is excluded. If human beings are en? dowed with libertarian freedom, then God cannot simply determine by decree what their free choices shall be, as he does according to Calvinism. It would seem plausible that this fact would introduce a degree of contingency, even uncertainty, into God's plan for the world; what he himself will do, and how things will ultimately turn out, will depend on how the human beings (and other free agents, if any) respond to the choices they are offered. The God who creates libertarian free agents, it would seem, must be prepared to take some risks. But Molinism shows how God can entirely avoid taking any risks ; prior14 to his decision to create anything or to place any free agent in a situation where she would make a choice, God knows exactly what choice would be made and so he knows, prior to any decisions of his own concerning his actions in creation and providence, exactly what the consequences would be of his making and carrying out any such decision. In view of this, God is enabled to be 'perfectly provident'; as Freddoso says, 10 The primary source for Molinism is Luis de Molina, On Divine Foreknowledge {Part IV of the Concordia), translated, with introduction and notes, by Alfred J. Freddoso (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1988). 11 There are also said to be 'counterfactuals of divine freedom', specifying what God would do in any situation in which he might make a free decision. But these counterfactuals are quite different in several respects from those with which the theory of middle knowledge is concerned. References herein to counterfactuals of freedom will pertain exclusively to counterfactuals of creaturely freedom. 12 It should be noted that the 'choice situation' is construed to include, not only the external circumstances and the internal character of the agent, but also any divine gracious influences which may be exerted at the time the choice is made. 13 Introduction to Molina, On Divine Foreknowledge, p. 1. The source-question contrasts with the 'reconciliation-question', 'How is this divine foreknowledge to be reconciled with the contingency of what is known through it?' 14 Here and elsewhere, references to what is 'prior' and 'posterior' in the divine will should be understood in terms of explanatory rather than temporal priority.</page><page sequence="6">96 WILLIAM HASKER God, the divine artisan, freely and knowingly plans, orders, and provides for all the effects that constitute His artifact, the created universe with its entire history, and executes His chosen plan by playing an active causal role sufficient to ensure its exact realization. Since God is the perfect artisan, not even the most trivial details escape His providential decrees.15 All this is true of what one might call 'generic' Molinism, but depending on certain additional assumptions one can derive an even stronger notion of divine providential control. The further question to be decided is this: to what extent do we think of God's options as limited by the counterfactuals of freedom describing the actions of his creatures? On the one hand, we might see these counterfactuals as circumscribing the sorts of situations God can obtain - perhaps he would have preferred that Adam and Eve not take the apple, but the ineluctable fact of the matter was that, if offered the apple, they would freely choose to eat it, and this is a situation God had no control over. But the version of Molinism known as Congruism (developed by Francisco Suarez) would dispute this reasoning. God, Suarez held, is capable of offering to humans inducements of grace sufficient to ensure that they will freely choose to do whatever it is that he wants them to do, and the function of counterfactuals of freedom is not to limit the results God is able to obtain but rather to guide God's application of grace to each person, so that grace ' congruous ' to that person's dispositions will lead to a favourable response to God's offer.16 Thus, Congruism holds that God could have arranged things so that Adam and Eve would freely resist temptation but, for reasons best known to himself, God chose instead to create a situation such that, although they could have resisted the temptation they would in fact yield to it and become sinners. One motive for the Congruist doctrine was to enable Suarez to hold a very strong (one might say, ' Calvinistic ' !) doctrine of predestination while still affirming libertarian free will. God does not, Suarez held, predestine persons for eternal life because his middle knowledge informs him that, if offered salvation under such and such circumstances, they would accept. No, God elects and predestines persons for salvation entirely without regard to any merits or personal attributes they might possess, and then he bestows on the elect, and on them only, ' congruous ' grace which will lead them actually to accept salvation.17 The non-elect, on the other hand, receive grace suf 15 Introduction to Molina, On Divine Foreknowledge, p. 3. 16 According to Robert Adams, Suarez assumed that ' for every possible honorable free act of every possible free creature, in any possible outward circumstances, there are some incentives or helps of grace that God could supply, to which the creature would respond favorably though he could have responded unfavorably' ('Middle Knowledge and the Problem of Evil', in The Virtue of Faith (New York: Oxford University Press, 1987), p. 90). To be sure, it will still be true that there are possible worlds God cannot actualize; the worlds, for instance, in which a person fails to receive 'congruous' grace but still responds favourably to God. But the significance of this limitation is much less serious than the limitations imposed on God by counter? factuals of freedom are often supposed to be. 17 See Molina, On Divine Foreknowledge, p. i99n. ; also John A. Mourant, 'Scientia Media and Molinism', Encyclopedia of Philosophy Vol. 7, pp. 338-9.</page><page sequence="7">PROVIDENCE AND EVIL 97 ficient to enable them to be saved (otherwise they would not be responsible for refusing salvation), but the grace is such that God knows infallibly that, if offered grace in that form, they will reject it and be damned. And now I am able to make a recommendation: if you are desirous of maintaining Calvin's doctrines of grace, yet shrink from the rigours of theological determinism, then Congruism is probably your best bet. (I believe, though I cannot argue it here, that Congruism is consistent with all of the traditional 'five points', with the possible exception of limited atone ment.18) And in general, if you wish to maintain a strong doctrine of providence, of the sort described by Freddoso, and yet to uphold libertarian free will, then Molinism is the only game in town. Now it is well known that challenges have been raised against the logical foundations of Molinism; the very existence of true counterfactuals of free dom has been seriously disputed.19 The force and conclusiveness of these objections is a matter of controversy, but I believe that most philosophers who have considered the matter would admit that significant questions exist concerning the logical foundations of the theory.20 On the other hand, the theory is often held, in line with the points made above, to offer great advantages for our understanding of divine providence. In consequence of this, some Christian philosophers are inclined to defend middle knowledge to the last ditch, while others, less firmly persuaded, find themselves in an uncomfortable middle position - unable to affirm the doctrine with a clear logical conscience, yet also unwilling to repudiate a theory which seems so valuable, perhaps almost indispensable, for enabling us to give an account of divine providence. I believe this approach to the matter to be mistaken. While the advantages of the theory of middle knowledge from a certain standpoint cannot be denied, I maintain that on balance it is a detriment rather than a help to an adequate understanding of providence. Specifically I shall argue that with respect both to the problem of evil and to the understanding of divine ` Limited atonement seems to be ruled out, in that a sinner for whom Christ did not die could hardly be said to have received 'sufficient' grace. It is true, furthermore, that Molinists would deny that grace is in any case 'irresistible'. But I should think that many followers of Calvin would settle for the assurance that, while it remains possible for the human subject to resist God's grace, it is nevertheless infallibly guaranteed that the grace will be efficacious. `9 On this see Robert M. Adams, 'Middle Knowledge and the Problem of Evil', American Philosophical Quarterly, xiv (I977), 109-I7, and 'An Anti-Molinist Argument', forthcoming; also William Hasker, 'A Refutation of Middle Knowledge', Jods xx (i986), 545-57, and God, Time, and Knowledge (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, i989), pp. 29-52.

Congruism makes things extremely difficult with regard to the problem of evil. I suggested earlier that the Congruist is nearly as well off as the Calvinist in being able to affirm total sovereign control ; to this must be added that he also is nearly as badly off as the Calvinist in seeking to account for the phenomena of evil. Congruism strikes at the heart of the free will theodicy, whose central contention is that there are some worlds God cannot actualize - including, perhaps, some which would be much more desirable than the actual world - because the counterfactuals of freedom are such that God's free creatures simply would not choose to act as they must for those more desirable worlds to be actual. The Congruist must say, however, that God could 'come very close' to any of these more desirable worlds - could, in fact, achieve worlds that are for most purposes indistinguishable from them -just by a more extensive exercise of his gracious influences on this or that occasion. And given this, the free will theodicy loses most of its force. Even apart from Congruism, Molinism is no boon to the theodicist. To be sure, a number of philosophers seem to assume that middle knowledge is an essential component of the free will defence. But this is a mistake; the free will defence works at least equally well without middle knowledge.21 And as we turn from the logical problem to the evidential problem and theodicy, the extra burden imposed on the theodicist by Molinism becomes evident. One main source of this burden is the extremely tight connection established between God's will and specific instances of evil. Recall Freddoso's words, quoted above: God, the divine artisan, freely and knowingly plans, orders, and provides for all the effects that constitute His artifact, the created universe with its entire history, and executes His chosen plan by playing an active causal role sufficient to ensure its exact realization. Since God is the perfect artisan, not even the most trivial details escape His providential decrees.22 Some of the less trivial details decreed by God include the Holocaust, the 21 Actually, Plantinga introduced the counterfactuals of freedom into his free will defence as a concession to the atheologian - specifically, as a way of understanding Mackie's suggestion that God could have brought about a world in which free agents always freely choose to do what is right. See Alvin Plantinga, 'Self-Profile', in James E. Tomberlin and Peter van Inwagen, eds., Alvin Plantinga, Profiles Volume 5 (Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1985), pp. 47-52. Tom Flint has suggested to me, however, that the free will defence may not work without counter? factuals of freedom. For it may well be that God's essential nature is such that he is extremely reluctant to take risks of any kind; if so, then it may be that, lacking counterfactuals of freedom to guarantee the outcome of his creative activity, God would necessarily have refrained from creating any free beings at all. If this is so, then if there are no true counterfactuals of freedom God's existence is not logically consistent with the existence of moral evil, and the defence fails. I shall leave it to the reader to evaluate the plausibility of this suggestion. The suggestion in any case has important ethical implications; it implies that human beings who are extremely risk-averse (possibly including some Molinists?) are more nearly in the divine likeness than the rest of us. 22 Introduction to Molina, On Divine Foreknowledge, p. 3.</page><page sequence="9">PROVIDENCE AND EVIL 99 killing fields of Cambodia, and Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait - each of them specifically planned, ordered, and provided for by God. God, fully knowing Hitler's counterfactuals and the use he would make of his freedom, specifically chose that he should become leader of the Third Reich and instigator of the Holocaust. Presumably the only recourse for the Molinist theodicist is to assert what Michael Peterson has called 'meticulous provi? dence ' - to claim, in other words, that every single instance of evil which occurs is such that God's permitting either that specific evil or some other equal or greater evil is necessary for some greater good which is better than anything God could have brought about without permitting the evil in question. That this is logically possible cannot be denied - but can it be maintained that it is a plausible reading of our experience ? Does it not, in fact, represent a heavy burden of implausibility for theism to carry? Molinists claim, to be sure, that only the good elements in God's plan are intended by God; the evil occurrences, on the other hand, are only permitted.23 Even if correct, this hardly solves the problem, but I suspect that it is incoherent. If the evils which occur are specifically decreed by God in order to achieve the best possible result, this comes as near as makes no difference to saying that they are accepted by God as means towards his desired end. And to intend the end is to intend the means. There is, to be sure, a way in which Molinism could avoid this result. Sometimes when it is said that God 'brings good out of evil', or that evil occurrences are 'ordered to good', what is implied is not anything as strong as the doctrine of 'meticulous providence' sketched out in the preceding paragraph. What may be intended is simply that in some way or other God arranges things so that some good results from the evil in question, but without the claim that the resulting good is better than the result God could have obtained without permitting the evil. On this view, it need no longer be the case that the evil is chosen by God as a means to the subsequent good, and so the distinction between what God intends and what he permits may be viable after all. But then another question looms, namely why God chose to permit the evil in question, when he could have brought about an even better situation by preventing it? And it does not seem that Molinism has a good answer for this question. So the Molinist is faced with a dilemma at this point : if he maintains a strong doctrine of meticulous providence and the 'non-gratuitousness' of evil, it must be acknowledged that God intends the evil along with the good, whereas without this strong claim he has nothing helpful to say about God's reasons for permitting evil. There is another way, more subtle but far from unimportant, in which Molinism hinders theodicy. One of the claims made in many, perhaps most, theodicies is that certain kinds of evil are important in bringing about the 23 Ibid. 4-2</page><page sequence="10">100 WILLIAM HASKER personal and moral development of human beings. This claim plays an important role in John Hick's 'soul-making theodicy',24 and it is also ap? parent in Eleonore Stump's contention that all undeserved suffering is a benefit (or at least, the best available means to a benefit) for the one who suffers, the benefit in question being primarily that one is drawn to acknowl? edge God and bring one's own will into harmony with God's will.25 Now, there seems to be considerable plausibility in the claim that the evils in question do have these sorts of benefits, at least on occasion. But it is an all too-familiar fact that on many occasions such evils do not produce the desired benefits : some turn to God as a result of suffering, but others are hardened and embittered ; some families rally round a severely handicapped child and achieve a remarkable depth of compassion, but in other cases the strain is too great and leads to the breakup of an otherwise successful home. What one might be inclined to say in some of these cases is that God has done his best for the persons in question but they have simply failed, through their own fault, to benefit from the opportunity. But on Molinist assumptions, the evil is decreed by God in full light of the knowledge that it would be unavailing ; whatever else might justify the evil in question it cannot be justified by God's intention to benefit those persons by it, for what one knows with certainty will never occur one cannot intend to bring about. For Molinism, no evil is justified by intended, as opposed to actual, consequences, for only the actual consequences can have been intended. As we turn to the topic of divine-human dialogue I am constrained to point out that God's way of dealing with human beings, as portrayed by Molinism, comes perilously close to manipulation. What after all is a ma? nipulator, if not a person who knows exactly how to 'push the right buttons' so as to elicit from us the reactions he wants? The manipulator never engages in genuine dialogue, for he never listens in openness to hear and respond to what the dialogue partner will say. But this is Molinism's picture of God. Once again, I cite William Alston : Given that God knows in advance exactly how I will react at each point, can He be said to enter into genuine interpersonal communication with me? Doesn't that require each party to be responding to the other as the dialogue develops, so that each party is actively involved at each stage, confronted at each stage with the task of deciding how to respond to what is proffered by the other at that point?26 Here, however, a qualification is required : what is subversive of dialogue is not merely that the speaker knows what the response will be before it is actually given; rather, the problem is that the foreknown response is the basis for the communication', one speaks not in a 'partnership' with the other, but rather controlling and manipulating the other's responses by one's own carefully 24 See John Hick, Evil and the God of Love, rev. ed. (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1978). 25 Eleonore Stump, 'The Problem of Evil', Faith and Philosophy 11 (1985), 392-423. 26 'Divine-Human Dialogue and the Nature of God', p. 150.</page><page sequence="11">PROVIDENCE AND EVIL IOI calculated moves. Not foreknowledge as such, but rather knowledge of the counterfactuals of freedom, is what corrupts genuine dialogue.27 IV. FREE WILL THEISM The term 'free will theism' is not as established in the literature as are ' Calvinism ' and ' Molinism, ' but of late it has begun to be used to designate a variety of theistic belief which (in contrast to process theism) maintains the classical affirmations of divine power and perfection, but lays greater stress on human freedom than have most traditional versions of theism. For present purposes, free will theism will be taken as holding that God has gifted some of his creatures with libertarian free will, and God's decisions concerning how he will respond to his creatures at each stage of the temporal process are based on what has occurred up until that stage of the process and not on knowledge of free choices which will occur subsequently. This, of course, specifically excludes foreknowledge based on causal determination, as in Calvinism, as well as foreknowledge based on counterfactuals of freedom, as in Molinism. It does not, however, exclude foreknowledge (if such there be) based on God's 'direct awareness' of the actual future events, nor does it exclude God's timeless knowledge of the future (if God is timeless). The definition does not require that God's deci? sions be made as part of the temporal sequence, but rather that whenever they are made, whether temporally or eternally, God's decision to confront a free creature with a particular choice does not rest on prior knowledge of how the creature will respond. Thus, free will theists may include eternalists and proponents of simple foreknowledge, as well as those who ascribe to God only a limited knowledge of the future. Indeed, I would say that eternalists and proponents of simple foreknowledge must, if they are libertarians, be free will theists - for I claim to have shown that both simple foreknowledge and timeless knowledge are useless and irrelevant with respect to God's providential governance of the world.28 But these points will not be reargued here, and for expository purposes it will be simplest to think of the God of free will theism as deciding in time how he will respond to the temporal actions of his free creatures.29 27 Here I must acknowledge that I am seeking to ' understand Alston better than he has understood himself. As Alston views the matter, it is not middle knowledge but rather foreknowledge which incurs the difficulty, and he uses this point in order to argue that divine timelessness is better than temporal foreknowledge from the standpoint of divine-human dialogue ('Divine-Human Dialogue and the Nature of God', pp. 150-61). I believe, nevertheless, that the point made in the text is correct and that the real villain here is middle knowledge. But if the reader is inclined to agree with Alston that foreknowledge as such is incompatible with dialogue, I have little reason to dispute the point. 28 For this see God, Time, and Knowledge, chs. 3, 9. 29 Free will theists among philosophers include J.

The difficulties and obscurities that plague Calvinism and Molinism over this topic simply do not arise. In dealing with the problem of evil, free will theism enjoys the immense advantage over Calvinism that it does not maintain that all the evils which occur are causally determined by God. The advantage it holds over Molinism are more subtle but still, in my opinion, very important. There is, first of all, the point that the free will theist will not say, as the Molinist says, that each instance of evil which occurs is 'planned, ordered, and provided for' by God. God knows, to be sure, that evils will occur, but for the most part he will not have specifically decreed or incorporated into his own prior plan for the world the particular instances of evil which actually occur. And this opens up for us the possibility of attributing to God certain general strategies by which he governs the world, strategies which are, as a whole, ordered for the good of the creation, but whose detailed consequences are not foreseen or intended by God prior to the decision to adopt them.30 So here the dictum that God permits but does not intend the evils receives a natural, unforced interpretation.31 In consequence, one is able to abandon the diffi? cult doctrine of ' meticulous providence' and to admit the presence in God's world of particular evils God's permission of which is not the means of bringing about any greater good, or of preventing any equal or greater evil. I believe that these differences between free will theism and Molinism are extremely helpful as we attempt to compose a strong and plausible reply to the problem of evil. Attacks on free will theism will most likely not be directed at these points, but rather at the general adequacy of this theory. Is the account of divine providential control given here strong enough to secure the interests of view include Clark Pinnock ('God Limits His Knowledge', in David Basinger and Randall Basinger (eds.), Predestination and Free Will: Four Views of Divine Sovereignty and Human Freedom, Downers Grove, 111. : Inter Varsity Press, 1986, and The Grace of God, the Will of Man: A Case for Arminianism, (edited), Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1989), and Richard R. Rice (God's Foreknowledge and Man's Free Will, Minneapolis: Bethany, 1985). John H. Wright, S. J.

(I am indebted to David Burrell for the reference to Wright.) 30 For an approach to theodicy which stresses the notion that God employs such general strategies, see William Hasker, 'Suffering, Soul-Making, and Salvation', International Philosophical Quarterly, xxvm (March 1988), 3-19; for full-blown theodicies embodying this idea, see Austin Farrer, Love Almighty and Ills Unlimited (London: William Collins and Son, 1966), and Michael Peterson, Evil and the Christian God (Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1982). 31 There remains, to be sure, the question why God does not prevent certain especially grievous evils. But I believe this question is far more manageable for the free will theist than for the Molinist.</page><page sequence="13">PROVIDENCE AND EVIL IO? Christian faith? And is God as conceived in free will theism great enough to be the proper object of Christian worship? With regard to the first question, perhaps the most interesting challenge32 is one which asserts that the God of free will theism would not be able to ensure the fulfilment of his plan even in the most general respects. If every single human being has it in her power to accept or reject God's offer of salvation, and if God has no advance knowledge of how a person will respond, then it would be possible for every person without exception to reject salvation - and if this were to occur, there would be no ' people of God ', no Church, and a key element in God's plan would be frustrated. As things actually stand, to be sure, this would appear not to have happened, but it could have happened ; that it has not, is attributable to nothing but ' God's luck'. I would suggest, to begin with, that this objection comes uncomfortably close to saying, 'If my theory is not correct, then God can't run the world properly. ' There are a number of possible responses to this, but for the present I will content myself with two replies. First of all, even if it is admitted to be possible, according to free will theism, for all human beings without exception to reject salvation, still this might be overwhelmingly improbable - so improbable that the risk of such an outcome is negligible. Consider a parallel : according to modern physics, there is a finite probability that all of the oxygen in a room should concentrate itself in a small volume, leaving the rest of the room devoid of oxygen and unable to sustain life. But the probability of this happening is so minute that rational persons can and do disregard the possibility in conducting their lives; I am completely confident that not a single one of my readers goes about with bottled oxygen in order to protect herself in the event of such an occurrence!33 But to the extent that God does depend on ' luck ' for the fulfilment of his plan, it needs to be pointed out that the God of {non-Congruist) Molinism is also dependent on 'luck'. Here, to be sure, the 'luck' confronts God at an earlier point, not in the actual making of a choice by the human being (that is guaranteed by God's knowledge of the counterfactuals of freedom), but rather in the counterfactuals of freedom God is confronted with in the creation situation. These counterfactuals are contingent truths, but their truth is not controlled by God; rather, they are just 'there' and God must make the best of what he finds. It could have been, for example, that all possible free creatures suffer not only (as imagined in the free will defence) from 'transworld depravity' but also from transworld damnation, the prop? erty of being such that, in every world God could actualize in which one exists and is free to make the decision, one freely rejects God's grace and so 32 Another challenge concerns the possibility of accounting for the biblical phenomenon of prophecy without ascribing to God comprehensive knowledge of the future. On this, see God, Time, and Knowledge, pp. 194-6. 33 I am indebted to Fred Suppe for this point, and to Robin Collins for the example.</page><page sequence="14">104 WILLIAM HASKER is damned.34 If things had been like that, God's options as regards creation would have been grim. It may be that under such circumstances God would have created no world at all - or, he might have created a Calvinist world ! In actuality, though, things do not seem to have been that bad - and this is so, whether one is a Molinist or a free will theist. But does free will theism portray God as one who is truly worthy of worship? I believe the answer is Yes - but to see this, we may have to overcome some conceptual ' sets ' engendered by other types of theology. I once wrote, God has complete, detailed, and utterly intimate knowledge of the entirety of the past and the present. He also, of course, knows the inward constitution, tendencies, and powers of each entity in the fullest measure. And, finally he has full knowledge of his own purposes, and of how they may best be carried out. Everything God does is informed by the totality of this knowledge ; the guidance he gives, if he chooses to give it, is wisdom pure and unalloyed... Whatever God needs to do, he has the power to do; whatever he sees is best to do happens forthwith. And if we trust him, we can also trust his purposes, for they culminate in the kingdom of God, which is our happiness and shalom. And now I ask, is this not enough? If God is like this, is he not worthy of our most entire devotion? And if we hesitate to agree to this, is the hesitation because a God so described would truly be unworthy, or is it because of our attachment to a theory?35 About the theories of Calvinism and Molinism enough has been said for the present. But the proponents of those theories might reply as follows : ' It may be that the God of free will theism would not be entirely unworthy of worship. But that really is not good enough - for I presume you adhere to the Anselmian conception of God as the Altogether Perfect Being, the one who is unsurpassable in every respect. And here it is all too evident that the deity as conceived by free will theism falls short. ' Though this may seem superficially plausible, I believe it is mistaken - that God as conceived by free will theism is not less perfect than God as conceived by either Calvinism or Molinism. Interestingly, it is easier to show this as regards Calvinism than as regards Molinism. So far as Calvinism is concerned, it should be sufficient to notice that God as conceived by free will theism is perfectly capable of doing exactly what the Calvinist deity is supposed to have done - namely, of creating a world whose every detail is entirely determined by God's decrees. The free will theist, however, takes a less favourable view concerning the merits of God's having created that sort of world; instead of admiring the conception of an omnidetermining God, he extols the generosity of a God who has brought into existence creatures which, while depending entirely upon God for their existence and all of their powers, nevertheless are capable of exercising those powers in a way which 34 The notion of transworld damnation was introduced by William Craig in '"No Other Name": A Middle Knowledge Perspective on the Exclusivity of Salvation Through Christ', Faith and Philosophy, vi (1989), 172-88. 35 God, Time, and Knowledge, p. 192.</page><page sequence="15">PROVIDENCE AND EVIL IO5 is partly independent of God's will - and thus capable, also, of aligning their wills with the will of the Creator in voluntary obedience and friendship. The free will God is not less but more than the God of Calvinism. In comparison with Molinism, on the other hand, the case is somewhat more complicated. This is because God as conceived by Molinism possesses a kind of knowledge - middle knowledge, including knowledge of the counterfactuals of freedom - which is lacking to God according to both Calvinism and free will theism.36 So it may seem that the possession of this knowledge shows that it is Molinism, rather than either of the other two views, which truly conceives of God as the absolutely perfect being. But of course, this judgement is very much subject to challenge. It is better for God to possess middle knowledge than not, if middle knowledge is logically possible - if, that is, there do exist true counterfactuals of freedom, and if it is logically possible for God to know them. But this is exactly what is in dispute in the arguments, referred to earlier, concerning the logical and metaphysical foundations of Molinism. These arguments will not be reviewed here. But leaving them aside for the present, it is possible to make a point more closely related to the argument of the present paper. For a maximally excellent God will presumably also choose to govern his creation in an excellent manner. So if one can find excellence in the vision of a creation which, wholly dependent every moment on the sustaining and energizing power of its Creator, nevertheless contains beings which possess under God unprogrammed freedom and creativity of their own - if such a case can be made, then it will be possible to claim that the God of free will theism is indeed the being than which nothing greater can be conceived.37 Huntington College, Huntington, IN 46jo$o-i2gg 36 Flint would reject this; he writes, 'Properly understood, Thomism [i.e. Ba?ezism - a subspecies of Calvinism] involves no rejection of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom; on the contrary, the Thomist will insist that there are such truths, and that God knows them' ('Two Accounts of Providence, ' p. 155). I must disagree. Both the Molinist and the Calvinist may hold that God knows propositions which could be expressed by sentences of the form, ' If A were in circumstances C, she would freely do X. ' But the concept of freedom involved is different in the two cases (in one case libertarian, in the other soft determinist) and so the propositions God knows according to Calvinism are not the same as the ones he knows according to Molinism - and only the latter are ' counterfactuals of freedom ' in the sense which is relevant here. In corroboration of this point, note that the Molinist's counterfactuals of freedom are contingent, whereas Flint himself has shown that the corresponding propositions for Calvinism are necessary truths (ibid. p. 164). 37 I am indebted for valuable comments on an earlier version of this paper to Thomas Flint, Alfred Freddoso, Michael Peterson, David Basinger, and to all the participants in the philosophy of religion reading group at Notre Dame.</page></plain_text>
