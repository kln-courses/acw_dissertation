<plain_text><page sequence="1">"She was laughing at their God": Discovering the Goddess Within in Sula The ancient Greeks created gods and goddesses so much in the image of humani- ty, so essentially anthropomorphic, that they represent and even make sacred many aspects of humanity since repressed by the heavy hand of Christianity. Sometimes the Greek goddesses are truly representative of women, but, of course, sometimes they are emblematic of patriarchal fear and loathing of the feminine. Thus even these ancient images must be used with care. When certain of these ancient images and Morrison's images parallel so closely as they often do, they validate one another. (Holloway 52) I n the Western world, the culturally ingrained "patriarchal fear of the feminine" has resulted in an imbalanced society whose members remain numbed and indifferent to life and toward one another. A great sense of despair exhibits itself in the American literary canon, which abounds with writers mourning the loss of some intangible force that might restore meaning to a world decaying into wasteland decade by decade. For many of these writers, that absent force is feminine in nature. At the turn of this century, for example, Henry Adams in The Education noted the absence of the Virgin as a spiritual force in America, a land which worshipped a frighteningly impersonal and non-regenerative godhead, the machine. The title character in Sinclair Lewis's Babbitt dreams of a female deity, a fairy child who can rescue him from modem patriarchal drudgery and meaninglessness. And Thomas Pyncheon's V. relates a similar wild and desperate search for a mysterious woman who is at once Virgin, Venus, and Mother. While these writers mourned the loss of a feminine spiritual center, later writers-women like Gloria Naylor, ntozake shange, and Toni Morrison-began to explore the possibility of discover- ing divinity and meaning from within, of reconnecting to the fem- inine archetype buried deep within the human psyche in order to resurrect a way of seeing and feeling which offers the promise of healing and life to an ailing world. As we near the close of the twentieth century, we are witnessing a reemergence of this femi- nine spiritual force. But unlike the "Virgin" whose loss Adams bemoaned in 1900, for writers like Toni Morrison the deity resur- facing from some collective unconscious yearning is more than just the repressed virgin of Christianity. She is the spirit of the Great Goddess, the archetypal feminine virgin/mother/crone who can provide what traditional patriarchal institutions have failed to provide: reverence for all forms of life. Morrison's novels lend themselves well to interpretation by current femininst archetypal theory. My discussion of Sula, although rooted in Jungian tenets, is filtered through a feminist revisioning of Erich Neumann's discussion of the Great Mother archetype. As Naomi Goldberg and Carol Christ have noted, Michele Pessoni recently earned her doctorate in English at the University of Connecticut. African American Review, Volume 29, Number 3 @ 1995 Michele Pessoni 439</page><page sequence="2">there is a need for critical revision of Jung. The problem with Jungian psy- chology, as set forth by Demaris Wehr, is that Jung and his followers tend to ontologize the archetypes, seeing them as authentic constructions of existence uninfluenced by social reality. The danger, then, in an ontologized arche- typal reading is that one may inadver- tently maintain the sexist or racist sta- tus quo by failing to acknowledge that even archetypes may be tainted by ide- ology. Yet Jung's lifetime of clinical work and his study of dreams and texts from many different eras and cultures did provide the basis for a psychology which argues that the key to wholeness lies in a reconnection to the human pysche, to instinct and intuition, to nature and life. All of these "feminine" qualities, Jung argued, had been repressed in a patriarchal world of sci- ence, technology, and reason; yet they were still present, appearing as arche- typal images in dreams and art. These images seem universal in that they strike us as being deeply meaningful and relevant to our present lives. Archetypes, however, as numerous theorists have since noted, are not fixed images. No one set of archetypal images-whether ancient or modem, whether Greek or African or Sumerian-should be considered the one and only true archetype. Archetypes are in a constant state of flux, recreating themselves over and over again. The powerful archetypal images which recur throughout Morrison's literary corpus represent new manifestations of a feminine archetype which has been haunting humankind throughout time. The Great Goddess archetype which appears in Morrison's novels functions as a unifying force, connect- ing human beings to one another and to nature in moral, social, and psychi- cal interdependence. Morrison's char- acters are all in desperate need of such spiritual connection because they inhabit disconnected and nonregenera- five patriarchal societies. While the term patriarchy is most often associated with the historical attitudes of the West's white, male, Judeo-Christian elite, as Morrison's novels so clearly point out, the patriarchal attitude is neither gender-bound nor race-bound. Rather, it denotes a psychic state of mind, a consciousness which often exhibits signs of hostility toward nature as well as toward any quality traditionally associated with the femi- nine: nurturance, community, contigui- ty. Patriarchal consciousness is orient- ed toward individuality, competition, personal acquisition-traits that are not necessarily harmful in themselves, but which become potentially fatal to the species when they are overvalued at the expense of feminine traits. Then individuality becomes arrogance and isolation; competition becomes combat and envy; acquisition becomes posses- siveness and mastery. According to Neumann, "This modem conscious- ness is threatening the existence of Western mankind, for the one-sided- ness of masculine development has led to a hypertrophy of consciousness at the expense of the whole man" (57). Morrison recognizes this psychic imbalance in our patriarchal world, and her novels call for a revaluation of the feminine. Revisioning the Great Goddess archetype is important to Morrison because it sets up a pattern for cultural and individual wholeness. Like her contemporaries Naylor and shange, Morrison relies on this arche- typal feminine imagery to offer a new perspective which counters the white patriarchal perspective that has domi- nated Western ideology. As Nellie McKay explains, "Contemporary black women writers consistently look back to their mothers and grandmothers for the substance and authority in their voices.... [they] have something spe- cial to contribute to the world [and it] is not white, and it is not male" (McKay 416). This new perspective is important for literary culture in gener- al, as it offers a model for cultural heal- ing through connection. As Morrison 440 AFRICAN AMERICAN REVIEW</page><page sequence="3">notes of human nature, "People need a larger unit" (Angelo 122). The patriar- chal paradigm breaks down this larger unit; it divides and dehumanizes, iso- lates and deadens. The archetypal fem- inine as Morrison envisions it encour- ages expansiveness and inclusion. It sets up a pattern for cultural and indi- vidual wholeness, for health and heal- ing through connection. Such healing and resurrection may be painful, but they are essential to our survival. As Amy Denver will say as she rubs Sethe's bloody feet in Beloved, " 'It's gonna hurt now. Anything dead com- ing back to life hurts' " (Beloved 35). The images of death and regenera- tion which abound in Sula are varia- tions of earlier manifestations of the feminine archetype which appears in The Bluest Eye. They also reflect the Goddess imagery of other cultures, particularly the Greek myth of the descent and resurrection of the Kore figure or Persephone. Morrison, in fact, once described all of her writing as attempts to "resuscitate the dead girl" and claimed that there are pieces of this dead girl in all the novels, "finger- nails in the first book, face and legs, perhaps, the second time" (Naylor 593). This technique of fictional reincar- nation reflects the Goddess myth itself, with its repeated burials and resuscita- tions of the deity who contains both daughter and mother. Sula is a fictional reincarnation of Pecola Breedlove. Both girls embark upon a mythic journey toward atonement with the Goddess. The first is destroyed when she accepts as revelation the societal devaluation of the archetypal feminine. The second faces an equally non-feeling, discon- nected society, yet she survives by moving outside the patriarchy before it can destroy her. In The Bluest Eye, Morrison relates the tale of the destruction of one young virgin who inhabits what I call a "motherless" or "dead" society; that is, one ruled by patriarchal consciousness, one without feeling. Morrison models the narrative on the Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone, a myth which, in its original state, as Holloway notes, "makes sacred" an aspect of humanity-that of the regenerative bonds between mother and child. Morrison, however, transforms the original in order to depict and con- demn a modem society where the myth has gone awry, a society in which patriarchal consciousness destroys these sacred bonds by destroying the human capacity to feel. Pecola Breedlove is the unwilling and unready Persephone forced to descend into a benumbing abyss of silence and madness. Claudia MacTeer is the one left behind. She can either allow herself to become as numbed to Pecola's story as the rest of the society, or she can tell that story and begin to feel the stirrings of a Demetrian anger which, though painful, promises resurrection and a necessary "coming back to life." The archetypal mythos of The Bluest Eye has been explored by critics such as Karla Holloway and Stephanie Demetrakopoulos, who call the novel "Demeter denied" (Holloway 32), and by Madonne Miner, who traces the novel's mythic parallels to the stories of Philomela and Persephone. In Sula, however, the mythos is not so explicit- ly stated, and the novel demands fur- ther critical exploration. Sula departs from a direct correlation with the myth of Demeter and Persephone, yet it con- tinues to employ the Goddess metaphor, stressing once more the necessity of "coming back to life," of reviving human feeling, of finding some center or "speck around which to grow" (119). The questing character, Sula, experiences and overcomes what Holloway terms the patriarchal fear of the feminine and eventually finds atonement with the spirit of the Goddess. She then becomes the miss- ing center for all of the other characters in the novel, a powerful symbol of the spiritual force whom the entire com- munity sought all along. Morrison explains, "I wanted Sula to be missed by the reader. That's why she dies early. There's a lot of book after she dies, you know. I wanted them to miss DISCOVERING THE GODDESS WITHIN IN SULA 441</page><page sequence="4">her presence in that book as the town missed her presence" (Stepto 478). It takes a long time for Nel to real- ize that Sula is indeed the missing cen- ter. For many years, Nel joins the com- munity in considering Sula an evil woman because, as Morrison writes, "They believed that she was laughing at their God" (115). The image provides a key to the novel as a whole, for it sug- gests a mythic feminine alter- native to the traditional patri- archal leadership whose god or ". . . magic 'government' was going to lift them up, out and away from that dirt . . ." (160). Sula's laughter toward the apparent impotence of this God and government suggests that the Goddess (or, metaphorically speaking, the new feminine way of see- ing and governing) is a deity greater than the patriarchally created God, stronger even than Adams's Dynamo. This image of Sula as Goddess laughing at the puny gods of the modern world and the patriarchal government to which her people subscribe also par- allels a similar image in Morrison's first novel, The Bluest Eye. Claudia experiences a divine vision in which her mother is swooped up into the air by the wind. The mother appears as Goddess-omnipotent, biding her time, and smiling as she surveys the lit- tle dramas enacted below. Sula eventu- ally is transformed into a goddess simi- lar to the mother-goddess of the first novel. She even prophesies her eventu- al triumph when she tells a disbeliev- ing Nel, "'Oh, they'll love me all right. It will take time, but they'll love me' (145). This specific instance of a powerful feminine presence whose cosmic knowledge allows her to laugh at the ultimate impotence of the patriarchal god and government shows the extent of Morrison's mastery at using myth as a powerful vehicle for political state- ment. Morrison, after all, never leaves us in a timeless mythic territory which lacks political import. In each of her novels Morrison is deeply concerned with the racial and sexual ills which plague modem-day America. Dorothea Drummond Mbalia identifies The Bluest Eye as primarily a study of The seeds which did not grow in The Bluest Eye are sown again at the end of Sula, and the spirit of the archetypal feminine takes root. racism and Sula as a study of gender oppression. Wilfred Samuels and Clenora Hudson-Weems concisely sum up the historical aspect of Morrison's second novel when they write, "This semi- nal work reflected the shift in the mood of society at large, where the emphasis had veered from the mass strug- gle for black consciousness to the personal struggle for self- realization and affirmation" (7). Morrison's novels cri- tique and condemn the white patriarchal system which is still accepted, tolerated, or endured by men and women of all colors. This system hier- archizes human beings, as Sula Peace and Nel Wright soon figure out: They "had discovered years before that they were neither white nor male, and that all freedom and triumph was forbidden to them" (52). Unlike her predecessor Pecola Breedlove, howev- er, Sula rebels against this system. She leaves the Bottom for ten years; she attends college; and she refuses to marry and produce babies, preferring instead to "make" (92) herself. She also consciously rejects the system which values material goods over humanity and life: "She was completely free of ambition, with no affection for money, property or things, no greed, no desire to command attention or compliments ..." (119). While Pecola prayed for the blue eyes that symbolized some white ideal of beauty, Sula is content to be herself. She explains, "I like my own dirt .... I got my mind.... I got me" (142-43). 442 AFRICAN AMERICAN REVIEW</page><page sequence="5">Sula's quest for a healthier alterna- tive to the patriarchal conscious- ness which destroyed Pecola is no easy matter. She is not so free of patriarchal consciousness as she imagines, for despite her status as outsider she has inherited the patriarchal fear of the feminine. Unlike Pecola, whose moth- er-hunger caused her to gulp "three quarts of milk" (Bluest Eye 22), Sula metaphorically rejects the nourishment of the mother when she insists, " 'I don't like milk' " (124). The archetypal feminine terrifies Sula. After witness- ing Eva's burning of Plum, Sula views her grandmother as the living embodi- ment of the Terrible Mother, a destroy- er equally as frightening as the patri- arch. In order to protect herself, Sula completely rejects this image of the archetypal feminine. Turning "her but- tocks toward Eva" (92), Sula says, "'...not you. I ain't never going to need you"' (94). Morrison recognizes the danger of relying too heavily on one manifesta- tion of an archetype. She also under- stands that archetypes can be influ- enced and limited by social constric- tions. She explains, "The archetypes created by women about themselves are rare, and even those few that do exist may be the result of a female mind completely controlled by male type thinking" ("What" 15). Sula is a prime example of a female mind con- trolled by masculine thought patterns. Morrison remarks of Sula, "She is a masculine character.... She will do the kinds of things that normally only men do, which is why she's so strange. She really behaves like a man" (Stepto 487). The frightened Sula cannot see beyond the patriarchal manifestation of the archetype as Terrible Mother, and her fear of the feminine is proof of her subconscious indoctrination into the patriarchal world. According to Erich Neumann, in a patriarchal world the fear of the feminine as Terrible Mother "expresses an archetypal experience of the whole species, male and female alike. For in so far as the woman partic- ipates in this development of con- sciousness, she too has a symbolically male consciousness and may experi- ence the unconscious as 'negatively feminine' " (148). Although Neumann's definition applies to Sula, he implies that the fear of the feminine is a natural part of the development of the individual consciousness. This is not Morrison's purpose in using the archetype. I believe Demaris Wehr comes closer to explaining Morrison's portrait of Sula's fears when she writes that "fear . . . must surely be the basis of misogyny and misogynistic projec- tions such as the devouring mother. Fear functions in the pysche as an agent of distortion, preventing one from truly seeing the other" (41). Sula sees only a distorted and incomplete view of Eva. The multifac- eted Eva is clearly more than just a Neumannesque Terrible Mother. She is also the archetypal embodiment of the Great Goddess who offers nourishment and regeneration. On yet another level, Eva is also a very real woman, capable of great love yet susceptible to the influences of the capitalistic ideology surrounding her. Even as a Goddess figure, Eva has faults. Morrison, who never creates infallible characters, says that Eva "plays god .... she's god-like .... she is very, very possessive about other people, that is, as a king is" (Stepto 478). It is important to note that Morrison describes Eva in masculine terms-as a king and a god. The description suggests that Eva's matri- archal throne does not reflect true matriarchal consciousness and that, despite her connections to the Goddess, Eva (like Sula) remains to some extent a victim of the patriarchal culture which revels in possession and oppression, allowing one person com- plete control over another's life. Despite this patriarchal infiltration into the archetypal image, Eva remains the figure most closely akin to the spir- it of the Goddess. Although she stunts the growth of the Deweys, she does not hierarchize or discriminate among them based on color but cares equally for the black, the white, and the DISCOVERING THE GODDESS WITHIN IN SULA 443</page><page sequence="6">Mexican Dewey. In the same way, although she hates BoyBoy with an intense passion, she bequeaths "manlove" to her daughters. Although Sula refuses to see it for many years, Eva is a Demeter figure, or at the very least, one of Demeter's priestesses. According to Robert Graves, "The priestesses of Demeter, goddess of the cornfield, initiate brides and bride- grooms into the secrets of the couch [even though Demeter herself] has no husband of her own." Eva, like Demeter, is unmarried yet deeply con- cerned about the relationships between men and women: "She fussed inter- minably with the brides of the newly wed couples for not getting their men's supper ready on time" (35). Eva's status as Goddess permeates the book, from her initial enthrone- ment at 7 Carpenter's Road to her final appearance at the convalescent home where, far from convalescing, she con- tinues to impart life-giving wisdom to her surrogate daughter Nel, wisdom about good and evil and how both reside in every human heart. Her home on 7 Carpenter's Road is a modem ver- sion of the Mystery sanctuary of Demeter at Eleusis. The sanctuary, as Kerenyi explains, "was originally a sin- gle room .... [then] this edifice was extended by three rooms.... If there was no other entrance to the court, the addition of the three rooms made it necessary to pass around or through them to the main building" (21). Like the Goddess's sanctuary, Eva's home at 7 Carpenter's Road is an edifice with many additions numbered in threes, the number of the triune Goddess who is virgin, mother, and crone. There are "three sets" of stairs and rooms with "three doors." And like the Mystery Sanctuary of Eleusis, many of these new rooms are "inaccessible from any other part of the house"-some, in fact, "you could get to only by going through somebody's bedroom" (30). Even Eva's burning of Plum has mythic and positive implications, despite Sula's condemnation of the act. A number of critics refuse to accept any reason as justification for the burn- ing of Plum. Trudier Harris, for instance, writes that "Eva is a slap in the face to all traditional matriarchs, for there is no God-centered morality informing her actions" (71). Harris is correct in asserting that there is no "God-centered morality" around Eva's actions. There is, however, Goddess- centered morality. Throughout most of the novel, Sula tries to escape being dominated by a God-centered morali- ty. Unfortunately, she has no other belief system to serve as replacement because, believing Eva to be the sole representation of the feminine, she has also rejected the feminine tradition in its entirety. Thus Sula remains in a spiritual vacuum, isolated from the community which still tolerates patri- archal godhead and government, yet too frightened to make the leap toward the mythic implications of a "Goddess- centered morality" wherein death does not exist. Sula fails to see the mythic whole in Eva's actions. She does not inherit the full story because she never asks the all-important questions which Hannah asks Eva," 'Mamma, did you ever love us'" (67) and " 'But what about Plum? What'd you kill Plum for, Mamma'" (70). For Hannah, Eva's rea- sons suffice: She burned him so that he could " 'die like a man not all scrunched up inside my womb, but like a man' " (72). Here is another prime example of the way Morrison revisions the archetype of the Great Mother as posited by Neumann. In Neumann's terms, the Good Mother is a passive receptacle allowing free entry into the womb, and the Terrible Mother is an indifferent destroyer who swallows or enwombs/entombs. For Morrison the archetype is less polar- ized. As maternal figure, Eva is no pas- sive receptacle. She refuses Plum entry back into her womb, maintaining a separate sphere for herself. Neither is Eva the Terrible Mother that Sula and so many critics make her out to be. She is no indifferent destroyer swallowing up life, but a maternal force who des- 444 AFRICAN AMERICAN REVIEW</page><page sequence="7">perately loves her son and who wants to preserve rather than destroy his manhood. Without the whole myth, the full understanding of why Eva burned Plum, Sula becomes like the frightened mortal in the Demeter story who wit- nesses Demeter holding her young son Demophoon in the fires of immortality and, lacking the knowledge of what Demeter is doing, snatches him out. Demeter angrily tells the mother that the fire " 'would have made your dear son deathless and unaging all his days, and would have bestowed on him everlasting honor' " (Homer 307). Like the Great Goddess in Homer's hymn, Eva brings manhood and honor to Plum by refusing to allow him to return to the womb and by placing him in the mythic fires of the feminine which can make him as deathless as Demeter would have made Demophoon. As Kerenyi explains, "A birth in death was possible! And it was possi- ble also for human beings if they had faith in the Goddesses; that is the mes- sage which Demeter herself pro- claimed at Eleusis, when she laid Demophoon in the fire to make him immortal" (94). Eva, despite all her human failings, understands these mythic rites. Hence, she chooses fire rather than water for Plum, and this is what differentiates her burning of Plum from Sula and Nel's drowning of Chicken Little. As Eva explains, " 'It's awful cold in the water. Fire is warm' " (168). Eva is also successful in making Plum deathless, for we learn later that he continues to speak to her from beyond. Long after Plum's death Eva says to Nel, " 'Plum. Sweet Plum. He tells me things' "(169). Kerenyi notes the importance of hearing the "mythos ... [which] means word, statement, originally a true, uttered happening" (26). He adds, "The myths form a public introduction to the Mysteries-an introduction indeed for us, who must steep our- selves in them if we are to arrive at an understanding of the forbidden ele- ment" (27). Morrison argues essentially the same thing when she observes, "Until we understand in our own terms what our rites of passage are, what we need in order to nourish our- selves, what happens when we don't get that nourishment, then what looks like erratic behavior but isn't will frighten and confuse us" (Jones and Vinson 143-44). Plum could no longer survive as a living, functioning man. Eva's act is one of mercy and strength, albeit a ter- rifying strength. Unable to accept him back into her own womb and rebirth him, Eva sends Plum instead to a preferable place, the collective uncon- scious feminine womb which can offer him immortality. Erich Neumann explains that the archetypal feminine is often mistakenly viewed in a tragic light because of its emphasis on the transient nature of life and the seeming insignificance of the individual. However, he adds, "This tragic aspect.. . is only one side, the dark earthly side, of the cosmic egg. In addi- tion to its earthly half, the Great Round also has a heavenly half; it embodies not only a transformation downward to mortality and the earth, but a trans- formation upward toward immortality and the luminous heavens" (53-54). Stephanie Demetrakopoulos con- cludes that Eva is a conglomeration of numerous Goddess figures, including Hecate, Sibyl, Hestia, and Demeter. She writes, "Eva is a portrait of archetypal feminine strengths that goes beyond the author's intentions" (Holloway and Demetrakopoulos 61). Perhaps Eva is, as Demetrakopoulos suggests, a stronger Goddess figure than even Morrison intended her to be. In either case, Sula's rejection of Eva is cause for concern, for her patriarchal fear of the feminine as Terrible Mother blinds Sula to the importance of maternal nourishment. In rejecting Eva, Sula cuts herself off from the one character who comes closest to pointing the way back to life through reconnection to the archetypal feminine. Even if she rejects patriarchal culture, without these DISCOVERING THE GODDESS WITHIN IN SULA 445</page><page sequence="8">sacred feminine bonds, Sula remains just as isolated and just as barren as Pecola, unable to create, unable to nourish, unable to connect. As Morrison explains, Sula "knows all about herself because she examines herself, she is experimental with her- self, she's perfectly willing to think the unthinkable thing and so on. But she has trouble making a connection with other people and just feeling that love- ly sense of accomplishment of being close in a very strong way" (Stepto 477). Sula cannot connect with other people because she has rejected both Eva and the archetypal feminine which is the source of connection for humankind. Having rejected Eva, Sula steels herself against all maternal femi- nine forces. When her own mother admits a dislike for her, Sula is already poised for defense: "She only heard Hannah's words, and the pronounce- ment sent her flying up the stairs." Frightened of the dark feminine forces around her, Sula begins a descent into the dark forces of her own psyche, and it is only Nel's call which "floated up and into the window, [and pulled] her away from dark thoughts" (57). Sula's probing of "dark thoughts" becomes a predominant motif in the novel. She discovers her own archetyp- al potential to be the Terrible Mother in acts such as the dismembering of her finger and the ritual sacrifice of Chicken Little. The community begins to regard Sula as not only strange and outrageous, but also evil. According to Morrison, Sula is "a classic type of evil force," but, Morrison adds, ". . . one can never really define good and evil. Sometimes good looks like evil; some- times evil looks like good-you never really know what it is" (Stepto 475-76). Unlike Nel, who never probes her own dark capabilities until she is prodded to do so by Eva, Sula is willing all along to explore this darker aspect of herself. While Nel numbed herself to the reality that ". . . it felt ... good ... "' (170) to watch Chicken fall, Sula will- ingly admits her morbid fascination with death, saying of Hannah's death, " 'I stood there watching her bum and was thrilled. I wanted her to keep on jerking like that, to keep on dancing'" (147). Sula's ability to "think the unthink- able" (Stepto 477), as Morrison says of her, is crucial to her development as a whole being. Because she is able to explore aspects of the archetypal self considered to be "evil," by the end of the novel she is able to move beyond the patriarchal imaging of the arche- typal feminine as destroyer into a more healthy image of the feminine as repre- sentative of wholeness and connection. Seula is not without a guide on her quest toward atonement with the archetypal feminine. Ironically, her guide is male-but he is a male who has been completely destroyed by the patriarchal system. Shadrack's mythic presence frames the novel, haunting Sula throughout her life and leading her to a resurrection after her death. The first chapter closes with words of mythic proportions as the people of the Bottom reflect on life, Shadrack, and Sula: "They were mightily preoccupied with earthly things-and each other, wondering even as early as 1920 what Shadrack was all about, what that little girl Sula who grew into a woman in their town was all about, and what they themselves were all about, tucked up there in the Bottom" (6). Critics often avoid mention of Shadrack or give him cursory dismissal when discussing Sula. Samuels and Hudson-Weems, for instance, sum Shadrack up by saying he learns the lesson that "death is the only given in life" (52). Melvin Dixon, on the other hand, claims that both Shadrack and Sula are inadequate figures who fail to fly and who seek instead an "under- ground refuge or hibernation" (130). Houston A. Baker, Jr., provides the most accurate reading of Shadrack when he identifies him as an historical symbol, "a blasted sign of capitalism's maddening control of man's fate" (239). On the literal level, Shadrack is 446 AFRICAN AMERICAN REVIEW</page><page sequence="9">"all about" (6) the effects on the human spirit when one subscribes to the patri- archal way of seeing self and other. He is about what happens when one fol- lows the patriarchal mandate to serve the government by blindly marching off to war to kill whomever happens to be the enemy of the moment. He is about accepting the patriarchal man- date that people are only as good as their skin color or their wallets. This patriarchal paradigm strips men and women of selfhood, fragmenting humanity into various usable parts for the machine, the dynamo, and leaving them with "no past, no language, no tribe, no source" (12). Shadrack is an integral part of the novel, and further critical inspection proves him to be just as powerful a mythic figure as he is a political sym- bol. His very name brings biblical reso- nances to the Book of Daniel, in which a man named Shadrach refuses to wor- ship King Nebuchadnezzar's god or his idol of gold. For this refusal Shadrach and two compatriots are thrown into a fiery furnace, yet the flames have no power to destroy them. Furthermore, an unnamed fourth pres- ence is mysteriously seen in the flames with the three men. According to Houston A. Baker, Shadrack proves the reverse of his biblical namesake: "Morrison's mad ritualist is a con- sciousness blasted and terrified into nonsense by the awesome workings of state power. God is decisively dead in Shadrack's universe" (239). Although it is true that Shadrack has been blasted by the patriarchal world and transformed into a drunk and a madman, Morrison does not leave him completely abandoned in the universe. Despite his madness, Shadrack returns to the Bottom, gravi- tating toward a Demetrian presence which calls him home. Shadrack is drawn by the image of a window, the thought of a river full of fish, and the voice of a mysterious "someone" who "was speaking softly just outside the door" (10). This mysterious "someone" is reminiscent of the presence of the fourth man accompanying the biblical Shadrach, the one whose appearance was "like a son of the gods" (Daniel 3:25). The "someone" is also very much like the feminine "somebody with hands who does not want me to die" in The Bluest Eye. Shadrack's "someone" is the spirit of the Goddess calling him back to life, standing by his side as the patriarchal flames roar, and refusing to allow him to be annihilated by the patriarchal authority which would take his life. Shadrack's ability to hear and his willingness to follow this voice from the unconscious are signs that he has turned toward a "matriarchal con- sciousness," one in which "the arche- type of the Great Mother dominates and the unconscious directs the psy- chic process of the individual" (Neumann 91). Guided by this voice, Shadrack returns home and enters "the first sleep of his new life. A sleep ... deeper than the pits of plums; steadier than the condor's wing; more tranquil than the curve of eggs" (14). He answers the call and becomes a Demetrian prophet and priest, a guide who eventually teaches Sula the saving powers of entering a sleep in the femi- nine. As the biblical Shadrach teaches his people, "There is no other god who is able to deliver in this way" (Daniel 3:29). Ironically, Shadrack never becomes consciously aware of the important role he plays in reclaiming Sula. Shadrack's transformative "first sleep" is the sign of his entrance into the feminine principle. Neumann explains that "rebirth can occur through sleep in the nocturnal cave, through a descent to the underworld realm of the spirits and ancestors, through a journey over the night sea, or through a stupor induced by what- ever means-but in every case, renew- al is possible only through the death of the old personality" (292). On the mythic level, Shadrack is about the death of the old personality-the one subservient to the patriarchal voice- and the rebirth into a new way of see- DISCOVERING THE GODDESS WITHIN IN SULA 447</page><page sequence="10">ing. Under the influence of matriarchal consciousness, Shadrack is finally able to see his own reflection and to love what he sees, something neither he nor Pecola Breedlove of the first novel could do under patriarchal conscious- ness. Shadrack sees his reflection in the toilet, where it has been symbolically discarded by the patriarchy. Yet the reflection itself revives him: There in the toilet water he saw a grave black face. A black so definite, so unequivocal, it astonished him. He had been harboring a skittish apprehension that he was not real-that he didn't exist at all. But when the blackness greeted him with its indisputable pres- ence, he wanted nothing more. In his joy he took the risk of letting one edge of the blanket drop and glanced at his hands. They were still. Courteously still. (13) Shadrack is associated with fish and fishing, both of which are mythic sym- bols of the Goddess. Sometimes, as Erich Neumann notes, the fish is "the symbol of the fertility goddess" (141). At other times the Goddess appears in the form of the fish: "She bears the fish's tail of the mermaid; ... [and] she is associated with sacred fishpools" (Neumann 276). The fish also repre- sents life itself. As Neumann writes, "The Great Goddess is the flowing unity of subterranean and celestial pri- mordial water, . . . and life is her child, a fish eternally swimming inside her" (222). Shadrack not only bears the name of a fish (the shad, a foodfish common to North America), but he also finds himself strangely drawn to Sula because "she had a tadpole over her eye (that was how he knew she was a friend-she had the mark of a fish he loved) . . ." (156). Although Sula is not aware of it, she brings connection to Shadrack. And Shadrack is the one person who recognizes on a mythic and perhaps subconscious level Sula's potential affinities with the Great Goddess. Not only is Shadrack associated with fish, but he also gravitates towards the town well. A townsperson remarks on his odd behavior at this well, saying that she" 'seed Shadrack carryin' on as usual... up by the well ... walkin' 'round it salutin' and carryin' on'" (116). The mythic impli- cations here link Shadrack intrinsically to Goddess worship. Kerenyi speaks of a sacred well where Demeter sat after Persephone's descent: "It was a mytho- logical well ... connected with the des- tiny of a virgin" (36). The "Virgin's Well," writes Kerenyi, was believed to be one of three entrances to Hades, and initiates of the Goddess would dance around it in expectation of "a flowering . . . from the depths" (37). Shadrack, then, becomes an initiate into the mys- teries of the Goddess. While saluting and carrying on-dancing, we might say-at the well of Demeter, Shadrack sees Sula and tips his hat to her: " 'And quick as that ... he stopped and cut on over 'cross the road, steppin' over to her like a tall turkey in short corn. And guess what? He tips his hat' " (116). The tipping of the hat shows a rev- erence, a respect, a subconscious recog- nition on Shadrack's part of Sula as the potential "flowering from the depths," the mythic virgin/mother/crone repre- sentative of the Great Goddess herself. Sula's response to Shadrack through most of the novel, however, is to flee. She fears the role of the Kore, the vir- gin, which Shadrack ascribes to her, for in her mind it means descent and sure death: " '. . . she put her hand on her throat for a minute and cut out. Went runnin' on up the road to home'" (117). For most of her life, Sula runs from Shadrack and from the mythic implications of atonement with the Goddess. Shadrack, of course, is no more an infallible prophet than Eva is an infalli- ble goddess. Despite his role as Demetrian prophet, he has been dam- aged by the patriarchy he once served. He institutes National Suicide Day not as a means to unite humanity with the spirit of the Goddess, but as a way to control death. His was "a struggle to order and focus experience. It had to do with making a place for fear as a 448 AFRICAN AMERICAN REVIEW</page><page sequence="11">way of controlling it. He knew the smell of death and was terrified of it, for he could not anticipate it" (14). Shadrack also does not understand the mythic significance of his words to Sula: He "said 'always,' so she would not have to be afraid of the change- the falling away of skin, the drip and slide of blood, and the exposure of bone underneath. He had said 'always' to convince her, assure her, of perma- nency" (157). Ironically, Shadrack's words prove prophetic for Sula despite his own mis- understanding about permanency, for they lead her to true permanency through entrance into the archetypal feminine. According to Kerenyi, the Eleusian cults did not fear death, but insisted on it as a means of transforma- tion and as a ritual step on the journey toward immortality: "A mythical being dies, but though attended by pain and bloodshed, his death is only an appar- ent one. Ever since this death, every death has been a prolongation of life. ... To achieve such immortality it was only necessary to take death-as this mythical being did-upon oneself" (Kerenyi 142). Sula does just this: Remembering Shadrack's prophetic words, she takes death upon herself: "Always. Who said that? She tried hard to think. Who was it that had promised her a sleep of water always?" (149). This is the moment of atonement for Sula, the moment when she finally accepts the mythic promise of connection to the maternal and feminine. And the descent does not annihilate her; it transforms her. We read, While in this state of weary antici- *pation, she noticed that she was not breathing, that her heart had stopped completely. A crease of fear touched her breast, for any second there was sure to be a violent explosion in her brain, a gasping for breath. Then she realized, or rather, she sensed, that there was not going to be any pain. She was not breathing because she didn't have to. Her body did not need oxy- gen. She was dead. Sula felt her face smiling. "Well, I'll be damned," she thought, "it didn't even hurt. Wait'll I tell Nel." (149) Kerenyi writes of the Goddess myth, "The central meaning of this mythical tragedy [is that] a woman had to go down to the underworld for the benefit of the community" (139). The mythic descent into maternal waters is the all- important step in the ritual passage of the female initiate. Water, as Neumann points out, "is the primordial womb of life, from which in innumerable myths life is born.... maternal water not only contains; it also nourishes and trans- forms, since all living things build up on and preserve their existence with the water or milk of the earth" (47). Despite her earlier "patriarchal fear of the feminine," Sula discovers that being "damned" to descend into these maternal waters proves not such a frightening or evil journey after all. She accepts "damnation" and discovers transformation. According to Neumann, "Such transformation is possible only when what is to be trans- formed enters wholly into the Feminine principle, that is to say, dies in returning to the Mother Vessel, whether this be earth, water, [or] underworld" (291-92). In the Goddess myth, the mother aspect of the deity grows angry and causes the earth to be barren after her daughter's autumnal descent. As Neumann explains, "When she is angry, the Goddess, as Demeter or Ishtar, as Hathor or Hecate, can close the wombs of living creatures, and all life stands still" (170). This mythic pat- tern appears in The Bluest Eye: In the autumn (September) following Pecola's rape, the earth fails to produce marigolds and Pecola fails to produce a child. The same mythic pattern is evi- dent in Sula. In October, shortly after Sula's death, an ice covers Medallion. Morrison writes, "Late-harvesting things were ruined, of course, and fowl died of both chill and rage." The human beings remaining behind are impotent in the face of this divinely inspired "rage," and they stand "won- dering all the while if the world were coming to an end" (152). DISCOVERING THE GODDESS WITHIN IN SULA 449</page><page sequence="12">The angry Goddess brings death to animal and human alike in a move to force the return of her beloved daugh- ter. Again Morrison follows the mythic pattern. Shadrack no longer sells fish because "the river had killed them all. No more silver-gray flashes, no more flat, wide, unhurried look. No more slowing down of gills. No more tremor on the line" (174). The river also kills a great number of townspeople, pulling them down into her womb-like "cham- ber of water." Clearly, much of this mythic anger translates into social and political terms. Morrison depicts the collapse of a tunnel built by racist and capitalist powers, and the novel emphasizes the destructive nature of industrialization when it takes prece- dence over human life. T here is no one critical consensus about the ending of Sula. Some see the novel as flawed, like Mbalia, who argues that its "solution does not take into account the roles of race oppression and class exploitation [but only] reflects Morrison's own idealism, her own immature analysis of the role of capitalism" (48). Others, like Barbara Christian, read the ending as a type of eulogy for the Bottom, a recognition come too late that a belief in Sula might have saved Nel and the entire commu- nity: "Sula might have survived, Nel might have lived, and the Bottom might still be" (Christian 175). I would argue, however, that despite her justi- fied anger about the racism, sexism, and materialism evident in the world of Medallion, Morrison does not allow the novel to end without hope. The archetypal feminine is surely resurrect- ed by the end of the novel. As with The Bluest Eye, Sula offers the possibility for regeneration and for a healthier alternative to the way we live our lives. Sula's posthumous deci- sion to " 'tell Nel' " suggests that Sula has not been annihilated and that the message of the Goddess may yet be heard. Walking home from Eva's funeral, Nel feels Sula's presence: Suddenly Nel stopped. Her eye twitched and burned a little. "Sula?" she whispered, gazing at the tops of trees. "Sula?" Leaves stirred; mud shifted; there was the smell of overripe green things. A soft ball of fur broke and scattered like dandelion spores in the breeze. (174) The breaking ball of fur is significant. For years, Nel had been haunted by this ball, a "gray ball, the little ball of fur and string and hair always floating in the light near her but which she did not see because she never looked" (109). This strange ball of hair is oddly reminiscent of Mrs. Breedlove's description of Pecola in The Bluest Eye as " 'a black ball of hair' " (98). But unlike Mrs. Breedlove, who rejects her role as potential Demeter figure and fails to listen to the cries of her daugh- ter, Nel listens and accepts. The epiphanic moment of the novel occurs when Nel realizes that all along she was mourning the loss of Sula: "All that time, all that time, I thought I was missing Jude." And the loss pressed down on her chest and came up into her throat. "We was girls together," she said as though explain- ing something. "O Lord, Sula," she cried, "girl, girl, girlgirlgirl." It was a fine cry-loud and long- but it had no bottom and it had no top, just circles and circles of sorrow. (174) The epiphany transforms Nel into a searching, sorrowing, feeling figure, a Demeter finally mourning the absence of the girlchild Persephone. On a myth- ic level, Nel finally "finds" Sula when she recognizes the archetypal feminine principle that was missing in her life. Thus the novel exhibits what Neumann calls "the one essential motif in the Eleusinian mysteries and hence in all matriarchal mysteries: the heuresis of the daughter by the mother, the 'find- ing again' of Kore by Demeter" (308). Nel may not fully understand her feel- ings, and she surely lacks the ability to initiate a cure for the ailing world in which she lives. But her experience does show a fictional progression: In The Bluest Eye, Claudia feels the first 450 AFRICAN AMERICAN REVIEW</page><page sequence="13">stirrings of Demetrian anger; in Sula, Nel feels Demetrian sorrow. Such sor- row, such intensity of feeling-painful though it may be-is a sure sign of "coming back to life." Demetrakopoulos writes of the novel, It seems to me that Sula itself is in fact an image of feminine psychology and metaphysics that will help carry the human psyche further into the light of conscious articulation and self-knowl- edge. Sula embodies a connection between feminine archetypes that has been held down, repressed even with- in the feminine collective unconscious. (Holloway and Demetrakopoulos 62) Morrison, less optimistic, perhaps, states that "Nel ... doesn't know about herself. Even at the end, she doesn't know. She's just beginning. She just barely grabs on in those last lines" (Stepto 476). It may not be much, but it is a beginning. The ball of hair breaks open, and the spores which are released from it are spores of the dan- delion, the flower beloved by Pecola. Thus the seeds which did not grow in The Bluest Eye are sown again at the end of Sula, and the spirit of the arche- typal feminine takes root. Works Cited Angelo, Bonnie. "The Pain of Being Black."
