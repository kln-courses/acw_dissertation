Although methodology went through significant changes in past decades, especially regarding the importance of experimental and ethnoarchaeological methods, many of these analyses still relied on typology, and the theoretical discussions were less diverse and much slower. In recent years, a concept of technology as a cultural-driven phenomenon has become more widely accepted, largely influenced by the technological approach from the French anthropological and archaeological school. The conceptual paradigm of chaîne opératoire is today a commonplace in almost every analysis of artefact manufacture, and it also triggered the creation of numerous different models for analyses from raw material managing through to the use and discard of artefacts. This paper discusses past and current approaches towards technology and its role within the given society. The combination of technological and contextual approach may not only improve our understanding of the artefacts in the context of a given society, their value, importance, function, and meaning, but also can help in starting the discussion on the creation of new theoretical frameworks for social phenomena such as raw material procurement, the organisation of craft production, the labour division, etc. The case studies on the bone industry in the Neolithic Balkans will be used as examples of the possibilities of such approach.

Although the concept of technology as social Technology is everywhere around us, as an inseparable and cultural phenomenon is more widespread in last few part of our culture; it has a strong influence on arts and decades, analyses of multiple technologies and technical sciences, and our everyday lives are unimaginable systems are still not that common. Also, sometimes without it, we use technology as symbols of status and interesting and instructive case studies on social aspects prestige, (ab)use it in politics.

He argued that the anthropology of technology or the anthropology of techniques "must aim THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF TECHNOLOGY at the comprehension of a technical system, and thus observe, describe, and analyse technical processes and In anthropology, the first and probably most not attribute more or less simplistic symbolic influential work was that by the French anthropologist significations to merely a few objects" (Lemonnier 1986: and ethnologist Marcel Mauss.

His the material world, but beyond immediate and most short but influential study, Les techniques du corps, obvious informational aspects, such as styles.

Therefore, the existence of operational sequences or of technical the social anthropology of technology consists of three principles in common, creating multiple relations of components: techniques, sociotechnical systems, and interdependence, which gives them a systemic character. material culture.

Most of Schiffer's work was separation between the utilitarian and the symbolic and devoted to the site formation processes, but he paid the very interpretation of tools as purely practical items, attention to technology as well.

The making of a tool is a structured process designing a shelter), or at increasingly more specific itself – there are practical rules for successful stone levels (such as designing entrance shapes for shelters or knapping, procedural rules for the making of particular designing attachment devices for structure elements, and forms – and yet there are also possibilities for individual so forth). Design theory principles assume that there are choice and innovation. When considered in this way, the different kinds of constraints operating in the use of bifacial techniques can be interpreted as development of solutions for each problem and that expressing control over timing and spacing, something trade-offs between constraints make it unlikely that there which may have paralleled the newly introduced will be any single optimal solution to a problem but, subsistence practices, while the structure of simple rather, a number of more or less equally acceptable versus elaborate tools is in fact a continuum of individual solutions. Among the most powerful of these constraints variation between pieces brought about by agents are functional requirements, material properties, exercising their own choices within a structure. availability, and production costs. Once a field of Sinclair demonstrated that these tools must be seen acceptable solutions for a given problem has been as items of material culture that are both utilitarian (i.e. identified (via trial and error or actual planning), the used to do practical things) and also symbolic: they choice of the solution that will be adopted may largely communicate meaning about both the nature of the tasks be a matter of cultural tradition, ideological values, style, for which they are used and the people who perform etc. However, most of the constraints leading up to this them.

Therefore, the logic and strategy for creating perform tasks in a satisfactorily efficient and effective prestige artefacts are fundamentally different from the way. For a given problem, the criteria used in choosing logic and strategy for creating practical artefacts. Prestige between alternative technological solutions are how technologies employ as much surplus labour as possible effective each solution is and how costly each solution to create objects that will appeal to others and attract is. In general, practical technology is a logical and people to the possessor of those objects due to admiration empirical response to stresses in the environment, for his/her economic, aesthetic, technical, or other skills. although, from time to time, people may experiment with Contrary to L.

Analysing the appearance and development with social constructionist interpretations (Killick 2004: of prestigious technologies among hunter-gatherer 575). S. Kuhn shares a similar view, stating that "fiercely communities, he argued that many, perhaps even all of defended boundaries between material, social and the technological achievements were initially developed ideological approaches to understanding human as prestige technologies and only later evolved into more behaviour, society and technology are a hindrance to practical applications – pottery, metalworking, domestication learning and are intellectually unnecessary" (Kuhn 2004: of plants and animals, etc. (Hayden 1998: 17–18). 566).  For explaining long-term changes in the role of technology, Steven Kuhn (2004) argued that the most applicable is evolutionary theory (Kuhn 2004: 563). PREHISTORIC TECHNOLOGY: THE CASE Some of the examples of applying evolutionary theories STUDY OF BONE INDUSTRY IN THE CENTRAL are the approach to explaining technological variation BALKANS NEOLITHIC AND AENEOLITHIC  and they are derived from a theory of technological investment (Bright et al. 2002, Ugan et al. 2003; cf. also Bone industry is the term that encompasses the Kuhn 2004): they consider the circumstances under assemblages of hard animal tissue (bone, antler, teeth, which people would benefit by investing more in the ivory, mollusc shell) – finished tools and other non- production of particular kinds of artefacts. There are utilitarian objects, manufacture debris and semi-finished numerous possibilities that can still be explored within products (Averbouh 2000). Osseous raw materials are the evolutionary approach. According to S. Kuhn, the often the only organic materials that survive from first priority is an increased focus on intra-group prehistoric sites, and were used from the earliest variation in technological strategies. A second priority is prehistory alongside with flint, stone, and – from the exploration of potential interfaces between Neolithic onwards – ceramic. Bone industry is evolutionary and "non-evolutionary" approaches. And extractive-reductive craft, meaning that raw materials are finally, there are possibilities for the application of transformed by mechanical modification (as opposed to evolutionary explanations of technological variation and transformative crafts; cf.

As these bones Divostin – Bačkalov 1979, Lyneis 1988, Vitezović were used in other, contemporary or later sites (for 2011a; Drenovac – Vitezović 2007; Međureč, Velesnica, example, in the Neolithic in France; cf.

Regarding the species used, (Selevac – Russell 1990; Divostin – Bačkalov 1979, we may observe an interesting fact here, that although Lyneis 1988; Drenovac, Motel Slatina – Vitezović 2007; the ratio of cattle rises in faunal record, the use of cattle Jakovo-Kormadin – Vitezović 2010; Stragari – Vitezović bones decreases.

Raw material choices Teeth were used rarely, and – with the exception of In the Starčevo culture, the main raw material were boar tusks – they were not transformed into tools. different bones (metapodials, tibiae and other long bones, Perforated teeth were used as pendants since the ribs, rarely astragals) and antlers, followed by teeth and Palaeolithic (cf.

Again, the species seem to have been elements generally suggests their mechanical and important – mainly wild ones were used (for example, physical properties were well known and adequately from bear or wolf, cf. Babović 1984: 126, Russell 1990: used (split long bones for pointed tools, flat bones for 534). Red deer canines were the most valued (Figure 3); different burnishing tools, etc.). However, it is worth they were sometimes even copied in bone (see also noting that only postcranial bones were used for tools, Choyke 2001a). Perhaps the opposition wild vs. while cranial bones were almost never used (mandibles domestic (sensu Hodder 1990) may be observed here, may occur as raw materials in later periods – cf. below). and – if we take into account that red deer antlers were The choice of species is generally in accordance with sometimes also used for decorative items – perhaps red species presented in the faunal record: ovicaprines (Ovis deer had some special meaning or importance.  aries, Capra hircus), cattle (Bos taurus, Bos Marine mollusc shells (Spondylus and Glycimeris) primigenius), red deer (Cervus elaphus). There is, are the most intriguing raw material here, since they were however, a general trend for choosing Bos bones for obtained through exchange of unknown character (cf.

Repair is sometimes difficult to observe, especially in case of awls and other pointed tools, but it seems that most of those tools were used for a long time. Repair and re-use are most frequent and most notable when it comes to "special" items: jewellery pieces, and, in case of the Starčevo culture, spoons (Vitezović 2011a, b). The standardisation of types, subtypes and variants increased in the Vinča culture (Vitezović 2007).  Regarding tool forms, it is interesting to note that some bone and antler tools imitate the shape of stone counterparts: axes, adzes, chisels. Therefore, some tools, such as heavy cutting tools, may exist in different FIGURE 3.
