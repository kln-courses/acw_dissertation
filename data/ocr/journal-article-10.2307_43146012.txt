(Grades 2-5) Nature's Sanitation Corps is a series of six books de- signed to present a more positive look at the sur- vival of life and the food chains in life. The main characters in this drama of life, struggle for ex- istence, and death are some creatures maligned as ugly or nuisances. The turkey vulture, green crab, land snail, burying beetle, hyena, and man are por- trayed as performing vital ecological services in the scheme of interdependence. The format of each book is identical. Each animal tells where it lives and how, as well as relating the services it performs. A conversational tone is used to relate the story such as this opening paragraph of The Laughing Garbage Disposal: "I'm far from being the most beautiful animal in the world. In fact, you might think I am one of the ugliest." In spite of the format that gives information as though the animal were talking, the authors manage to avoid anthropomorphism. Each book is beautifully illustrated with full-color drawings on each page by an outstanding natural artist. Although the reading level recommended by the publisher is grades 2-5, some children may have difficulty with some of the words and concepts. The books are so well written and attractive that the minor difficulties can be overcome. Teachers could read these books to children or discuss the vocab- ulary before children read them. Certainly the illus- trations could be stimulating for non-readers. The Knight in Crusty Armor. After a physical description of the crab and the reasons for the need for its outer shell, its function as a cleaner of dead or dying sea creatures and plants is shown with words and illustrations. An excellent series of animated drawings comparing a crab and a human hand demonstrates how a crab moves. Other crabs are compared and contrasted with this animal. The green crab's struggle for existence is the final part of the book. The Laughing Garbage Disposal. The opening statement used to describe how ugly he is sets the stage for this story of the laughing hyena. The hyena's unique bone-crushing jaws and teeth enable him to pulverize and destroy bones and whole car- casses of animals left behind by flesh-eating animals and insects. Hunting patterns as well as tricks of survival of the hyena are explored. Nature's Carpet Sweeper. The snail's anatomy is shown, including its "foot," tentacles and eyes, and "teeth" or rodula. The role of the snail in nature is vividly described along with the predators of the snail. Beautiful colored illustrations of land and sea snails make this one of the more attractive books. Children should find the drawings stimulating; this book could spark an interest in shell collecting. Nature's Smallest Gravedigger. The beetle is only an inch long but it buries animals more than one hundred times its size. As it eats the decaying flesh of the buried animal it is joined by the ground bac- teria to totally demolish the animal. The specialized parts of the beetle are described and discussed. The digging process is elaborately detailed and fascinat- ing to read and follow by the excellent illustrations. Nature's Flying Janitor. The vulture's search for a meal is presented as a daily soaring on large wings using rising air currents. Vultures travel in large numbers; if no other animals are around they will land and devour a dead animal. Occasionally, vul- tures overeat and cannot get airborne. If attacked by animals on the ground, vultures spray their regurgi- tated foul-smelling food on their predators and chase them away. The vulture's part in the food web is shown in ridding the earth of small animals killed by speeding cars, fish tossed away by fishermen, dead tadpoles in a dried-up stream, leftovers from the butcher shop, or food found in the garbage dump. Other members of the vulture family are compared. Nature's Assistant. Homosapiens' (or man's) development from simple food gatherer to hunter, to farmer, to inventor, to unbalancer of nature's system of checks and balances is outlined. One of the greatest problems man has is the disposal and ultimate decomposition of such materials as glass, aluminum, tin, and plastic. Man's greatest creative facility- his brain- must be put to use in searching for ways of not merely collecting garbage, but in re- cycling the elements in it. Answers are not provided on how this can be done, but the reader is invited to join in the campaign to clean up man's world. Arthur A. Carin</page></plain_text>
