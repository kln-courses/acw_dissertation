<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Byzantine Understanding of the Qur'anic Term al- Samad and the Greek Translation of the Qur'an By Christos Simelidis In his 1988 University Lecture in Religion at Arizona State University, Josef van Ess argued for a widespread concept of a "compact" God in early Islam. The notion is expressed by samad in Sura 112.2, an enigmatic word, which "in the first half of the second Islamic century (and probably even before) . . . was un- derstood as meaning 'massive, compact.'"1 There is Islamic evidence for this, van Ess argued: "The best testimony, however, comes from outside Islam: Theodore Abù Qurra, bishop of Harrãn in Upper Mesopotamia (ca. 750-825), translated samad into Greek as sphyropëktos , a quite unusual word meaning something like 'hammered together, closely united.' Nicetas of Byzantium later on used holo- sphyros instead, 'entirely chased in metal.'"2 Those familiar with the negative reception of these Byzantine translations of samad by several scholars will un- doubtedly be surprised by van Ess's statement, which considers the translations as trustworthy testimony. When John Meyendorff had earlier wondered tenta- tively whether some Byzantine interpretations of Islamic doctrine, including God sphyropëktos or holosphyros, could "in fact come from some forms of popular Arab religion - distinct, of course, from orthodox Islam - which were known to the Byzantines," his thought was called "provocative."3 Scholars translate sphy- ropëktos (ôçvQÓJtriXTOç;) as "beaten solid into a ball" (Sidney H. Griffith and Daniel J. Sahas)4 or "solid (forged with a hammer)" (Reinhold Glei and Adel Theodor Khoury)5 and holosphyros (óA.óo&lt;puqoç) as "of hammer-beaten metal" I would like to thank Sebastian Brock, Andrew Faulkner, Christopher Melchert, Walid Saleh, Ni- gel G. Wilson, and the anonymous readers for Speculum for their helpful comments and suggestions. 1 Josef van Ess, The Youthful God : Anthropomorphism in Early Islam (Tempe, Ariz., 1988), p. 5.

Hanson),7 "im- penetrable" (Karl Forstel),8 or "made of solid metal beaten to a spherical shape" (Sahas).9 They are often inclined to assume that the Greek words represent "a clumsy translation" (Khoury),10 "a blatant, derogatory mistranslation of the di- vine epithet samad " (Hanson),11 "the result of a biased attitude and wrong in- terpretation of the Quťanic proclamation of Allah" (Sahas),12 or "one of the stock examples in Christian polemics against Islam" (Kees Versteegh)13 or that they were "probably originally chosen for polemical reasons, to claim that Muslims believe in a material, corporeal God" (Griffith).14 Perhaps under the impres- sion of these views, in his recent translation of Theodore Abü Qurrah, John C. Lamoreaux, instead of sphyropëktos, adopts a variant reading, steiropëktos (ateiQÓjrriXTOç;), meaning "barren-built."15 However, the translations of holosphyros and sphyropëktos cited above are not accurate. Jean Darrouzès observed in 1972 that one of the translations proposed for samad in Quťanic scholarship, that is, "dense" or "compact," corresponds exactly to the Greek adjectives.16 His view contrasts sharply with the later views quoted above. In clarifying this problem, this article will review carefully the ev- idence both on the meaning and use of holosphyros and sphyropëktos in Greek and on the early Islamic exegesis of samad . For the first time, the Greek trans- lations of samad will be juxtaposed, not with modern translations of samad , but with translations and exegeses that could have been available to the ninth-century Greek translator of the Qur'an.

Many other surviving fragments of the Greek translation of the Qur'an suggest that this translation is in general more accu- rate than scholars have been willing to admit and that it was prepared with the help of lexicographical and exegetical material. As a result, the Greek transla- tion of the Qur'an offers an important, but hitherto misunderstood and under- estimated, contribution to our knowledge of the earliest reception of the Qur'an. The polemical tactics of later Byzantine theologians writing against Islam and quoting from the translation should not be confused with the translation's accu- racy. The case of holosphyros will be reviewed in detail, and I will show that the word was misunderstood (intentionally or otherwise) by Nicetas of Byzantium, who was influential in later Byzantine literature on Islam. Al-Samad in Sura 112.2 Sura 112.1-4 reads as follows: ^ay, "He is God the One, 2God the eternal. 3He begot no one nor was He begotten. 4No one is comparable to Him."17 In verse 2 "eternal" is a common modern translation for the term al-samad.ls However, the meaning of this word is far from clear;19 in fact, it is a well-known linguistic puzzle in the text of the Qur'an.20 A close reading of Qur'anic tafstr (commentary) has enabled Uri Rubin to illuminate the use of the word in the Quťan and its later understanding by Muslim commentators.21 The Quťanic meaning of the word and that of later exegesis should not be confused: the un- derstanding of the post-Quťanic epoch does not necessarily reflect the Quťanic meaning of a particular term. According to Rubin, the term appears in the Quťan in its original, pre-Islamic meaning, which was "the highest authority"; al-samad could be applied to the Arab sayyid (noble) to indicate the highest authority in 17 The translation is by M. A. S. Abdel Haleem, The Qur'an: A New Translation (Oxford, 2004). Haleem notes for "eternal": "Samad: other commonly held interpretations include 'self-sufficient' and 'sought by all' (Razi)." Unless otherwise stated, all translations of the Qur'an in this article are from Abdel Haleem. 18 E.g., "Allah, the Eternal, Absolute": Abdullah Yusuf Ali, The Holy Koran: Translation and Com- mentary (Lahore, 1934). 19 Other English translations include "the Independent" (Abdul Majid Daryabadi, The Glorious Qur'an: Text , Translation and Commentary [Leicester, 2001]) and "Lord Supreme" (Tarif Khalidi, The Qur'an: A New Translation [London, 2008] ). For more translations of this passage (completed between 1547 and 1939) see Franz Rosenthal, "Some Minor Problems in the Qur'an," in The Joshua Starr Memorial Volume (New York, 1953), pp. 67-84 (section 2). 20 See Michael Cook, The Koran: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford, 2000), p. 136. 21 Uri Rubin, " Al-Samad and the High God: An Interpretation of Süra CXII," Der Islam 61 (1984), 197-217.

Rubin has shown that al-samad , which occurs only once in the Quťan, was in later times (from the second Islamic century/eighth century A.D.) systematically reinter- preted by Muslim commentators who wanted to eliminate some theological dis- advantages of its original meaning, especially its polytheistic roots. A suppres- sion of the original meaning is evident in al-Tabarl's Tafsïr (early tenth century), where almost no traces of the pre-Islamic traditions are to be found. The new meaning given to the term was "something which is not hollow (lay sa bi-ajwaf) or, without hollowness (lã jawfa lahu ), i.e., consisting of one, solid, unchange- able monolithic entity."22 Josef van Ess has drawn attention to a legend that il- lustrates very well the concept of a God without hollowness. It is found in al- Tabarï's Tafsïr: [When God created Adam,] the angels passed by him and were alarmed when they saw him. But the most alarmed of them was Iblïs, and he would pass by him and strike him, and the body would make a sound like pottery makes, and it had a hollow ring - whereupon He says: "He created man of a clay like that of a potter" (55:14) - and he would say: "You were created for some reason!" He would go in through Adam's mouth and come out through his rear. Then he would say to the angels: "Do not be afraid of this: your Lord is solid (samad), but this is hollow. Indeed, if I am given power over it, I shall utterly destroy it."23 As Rubin explains, It was soon realised that the interpretation of Allãh as something without hollowness (jawf), i.e., solid, could imply that he was material (jism). For this reason, it was es- sential to reshape this interpretation so that it would become clear that Allâh's solidity meant only that he was independent of humanly, worldly, changeable qualities. The word jawf was, accordingly, taken to denote a human belly, and it was explained that al- samad was he who did not have a belly like that of created beings, or, he who did not have intestines, or, he who was not hollow, and did not eat or drink, or, simply, he who did not eat or drink.24 A further interpretation produced to eliminate the implications of a material God associated the "solidity" of Allah with what follows in the Qur'anic text (verse 3). It was thus suggested that al-samad was "something out of which noth- ing came out" or "he who neither begets nor is begotten." Rubin points out that "being a unique Quranic epithet of Allãh, al-samad eventually came to be re- garded as the most elevated attribute of Allãh" and "as forming part of the Great- est Name of God (ismu llãhi 1-ас%ат ), being identified with the biblical epithet Sebã3õt ."25 22 See Rubin, " Al-Samad and the High God," pp. 202-3 and 210-14.

See Abdel Haleem, Qur'an, p. 444. 27 Van Ess, The Youthful God , p. 3. 28 Sura 112 was dropped from the coins by the 'Abbasids in 750. See Jere L.

This statement clearly corresponds to Sura 112.3, "He begot no one nor was He begot- ten." See Thomas E. Burman, Reading the Qur'än in Latin Christendom , 1140-1560 (Philadelphia, 2007), pp. 28 and 218 n. 69. See also van Ess, The Youthful God , p. 3. According to Burman, al- TabrisI (twelfth century) also explicitly mentions Christians among those whose teaching is refuted at 112.3, but other commentators do not do so, taking the verse as a response to the questions of "polytheists." 32 See Angelika Neuwirth, Der Koran als Text der Spätantike: Ein europäischer Zugang (Frank- furt, 2010). 33 Walid Saleh, private communication (December 23, 2009). Friedrich Sylburg (1536-96) and Ja- cob Gretser (1562-1625) understood holosphyros and sphyropëktos, the Byzantine translations of al-samad , as referring to a unipersonal God in contrast to the Trinitarian Christian God.

[And in addition to all these I anathematize the god of Muhammad, concerning whom he says that "He is god the one, god holosphyros, he begot no one nor was he begot- ten nor is anyone comparable ( homoios ) to him." By anathematizing and renouncing everything I have stated, including Muhammad and his sphyrělatos god, I am siding with Christ, the only true God.] Samad is here translated as holosphyros ; sphyrělatos , a synonym of holosphyros offered a few lines later, seems to be used contemptuously in this context with the intention to present a material God. But my main aim here is to investigate the Greek translation of samad itself. As noted above, Nicetas of Byzantium of- fers the same translation ( holosphyros ), which will be discussed in more detail below. Although almost nothing is known about the life of Nicetas, one of the most influential Byzantine theologians who wrote against Islam, we do know that he was active in the middle of the ninth century. In his Confutatio falsi libri quem scripsit Mohamedes Arabs ( Refutation of the Book Fabricated by the Arab Muhammad) Nicetas quotes in Greek translation about two hundred verses of the Quťan.36 It is clear that the translation is not his own because he occasion- ally has difficulty understanding it. Moreover, as Erich Trapp has shown, a com- parison of this translation with the translation cited in the anathemas of the con- version ritual leaves no doubt that both Nicetas and the author of the anathemas drew on the same Greek translation of the Quťan.37 Since the date of the ritual for the reception of Muslim converts to Christianity is úncertain, we should as- sume that the terminus ante quem for the Greek translation of the Qur'an is the middle of the ninth century. It probably belongs to the beginning of the ninth century. thica ([Heidelberg]: Ex typographeio H. Commelini, 1595), pp. 74-91, and reprinted in Migne's Pa- trologia Graeca, 140:123-36.

Adel-Théodore Khoury ( Les théologiens byzantins et l'islam: Textes et auteurs [VlIIe-XIIIe s.] , 2nd ed. [Louvain, 1969], p. 187) dates the ritual to the end of the ninth or the beginning of the tenth century, while Franz Cumont ("L'origine de la formule grecque d'abjuration imposée aux musul- mans," Revue de l'histoire des religions 64 [1911], 143-50) argues that it contains material origi- nating as early as the late seventh century or the early eighth century. 36 According to Versteegh, "Greek Translations" (above, n. 13), p. 54. 37 Erich Trapp, "Gab es eine byzantinische Koranübersetzung?," Diptycha 2 (1980-81), 7-17.</page><page sequence="7">The Greek Translation of the Quťan 893 The Greek Translation and Islamic Exegesis of the Quťan According to Kees Versteegh, the Greek translation is "rather literal" and is "not really a bad translation at all. . . . The translator seriously attempts to trans- late the complete Arabic text, giving each Arabic element a Greek equivalent, as far as possible."38 A similar verdict is given by Christian Hogel, who concludes that "a high degree of precision and consistency was aimed at and normally achieved."39 Although the usual assumption is that the translator was a Chris- tian, Hogel raises the possibility that the translation was made by a Muslim, as a help for the non- Arab believer.40 Versteegh argues that the translator was not a native speaker of Arabic and cites examples of grammatical constructions mis- understood.41 However, he also shows that some of the Greek translator's non- canonical interpretations find support in the Qur'anic exegetical literature or fol- low variant readings of the Qur'anic text. This is very important because it suggests that the translator did not have in front of him the standard text that we have today and also, it seems, that he had access to some exegetical litera- ture. Versteegh also offers examples of mistakes in the Greek translation that, as he argues, could be easily explained if the translator worked from a copy of the Quťan that lacked vowel signs and some diacritics; interestingly, it is known that the earliest copies of the Qur'an were written in a scriptio defectiva , that is, with- out vowels or diacritical points. The process of clarifying the script in Qur'anic manuscripts was gradual, and "the system as we know it today seems to have been introduced towards the end of the ninth century."42 It is thus almost cer- tain that the manuscript used by the Greek translator had a good number of am- biguities, whose resolution would not have been an easy task for a non-native speaker of Arabic or for someone with no familiarity with the Qur'an.43 The lex- icographical and exegetical material that would have been available to the Greek translator could certainly answer several questions, but perhaps not all. It is also possible that the translator did not consult the material frequently. In certain cases the translator might have had to make a conscious choice among more than one variant reading or interpretation.44 Help by a native speaker of Arabic should not be excluded. However, for some mistakes that might be explained by the 38 Versteegh, "Greek Translations," pp. 60-64. 39 Christian Hogel, "An Early Anonymous Greek Translation of the Qur'an: The Fragments from Niketas Byzantios' Refutatio and the Anonymous Abjuratio , " Collectanea Christiana Orientalia 7 (2010), 65-119, at p. 70. 40 Hegel, "Greek Translation," pp. 72-73. 41 Versteegh, "Greek Translations," pp. 60-65, discusses the translator and his translation. 42 François Déroche, "Written Transmission," in The Blackwell Companion to the Qur'än, ed.

Versteegh assumes that "the translator did not have access to the extensive exegetical literature and had to make do with what lex- icographical material he had." But some use of a commentary should be al- lowed, as various examples offered by Versteegh himself clearly suggest; for ex- ample, he argues that an ambiguous manuscript could possibly explain the translation of Sura 53.6, dhü mirratiti '(with) great strength', as ó eùOBCDQriTOç 'well visible', "although in this case there is an interpretation in the exegetical literature which supports the translation."45 More examples will be cited below. One hundred twelve fragments transmitted by Nicetas, by the anathemas, and by Euthymios Zigabenos have now been published by Karl Forstel.46 Another edition by H0gel was produced independently and published a year later.47 He- gel published only eighty-two fragments, since he did not include free para- phrases and did not consider Zigabenos (fl. c. 1100), a theologian who wrote a refutation of heresies at the invitation of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. In some cases Forstel and Hogel discuss briefly the translations, but neither investigates the Qur'anic exegetical literature. Some of the cases where Forstel asserts that the Byzantine translation is wrong have already been explained by Versteegh as following early interpretations recorded by Muslim commentators or variant Qur'anic readings;48 examples include the title of Sura 7, where al-Äräf 'the heights' is rendered as eíç та yvu&gt;QÍo'iaTa 'to the signs', and Sura 90.4, where the expression fi kabad 'for toil and trial' is translated as èv io/m 'in strength' (there is thus no need for Förstel's conjecture èv ioxvcmyci 'in weakness').49 Ac- cording to Forstel, fragment 32 (Sura 5.47), síç то XQtvai toùç toû Evayyekíov 'to judge those under the gospel', is a "tendentious misinterpretation," a "gro- tesque misunderstanding of the Quťanic passage," and a "capital error," which demonstrates a "complete ignorance of the Islamic religion," since it presents Christ as the "judge of the world at the Last Judgement."50 But Versteegh notes that the Greek text here is "either a mistake or a translation based on a different reading, several of which are mentioned in the exegetical literature, in particular the one proposed by Ubayy wa-an ahkuma ."51 Another case has been explained 45 Versteegh, "Greek Translations," pp. 61-63. 46 Karl Forstel, ed. and trans., Schriften zum Islam von Arethas und Euthymios Zigabenos und Fragmente der griechischen Koranübersetzung , Corpus Islamo-Christianum, Series Graeca, 7 (Wies- baden, 2009), pp. 15-16 and 85-122.

For God, he says, is not ashamed.] According to Forstel, this fragment corresponds to Sura 2.25-26, but in this passage it is only said that men will have purified spouses in Paradise. Also, Forstel adds, the phrase that God is not ashamed belongs to the following state- ment. That is true, but Forstel is not justified in blaming the Greek translation for this mix-up.55 It is Nicetas's fault, and Forstel has failed to realize that Ni- cetas must have drawn the first part of the quotation above from a passage of the Quťan other than the one he suggests; see, for example, Sura 44.54, where wa-zawwajnähum bi-hürin cînin is translated by Fred Leemhuis as follows: "and we shall pair them off with white ones, with beautiful eyes."56 52 Wolfgang Eichner, "Die Nachrichten über den Islam bei den Byzantinern," Der Islam 32 (1936), 133-62 and 197-244, at p. 210. Eichner says that the Greek translation is here "a wrong interpre- tation." 53 Newman, Christian-Muslim Dialogue (above, n. 12), p. xi. A further example cited by Newman concerns fragment 70 (Sura 18.86), where the Greek translation offers Oeq^ióv xîôwq 'warm water' for the Qur'anic "muddy spring"; Newman argues that "several early Qur'an codices, including Ibn Mas'üd's, also had hamiya (=hot) instead of the 'Uthmãnic reading hami' (=muddy)." Newman ar- gues further that "there seems to be good reason for believing that this text [i.e., the Qur'an manu- script available to the Greek translator] may have been both pre-'Uthmanic and somehow related to the codex of Ibn Mas'ùd." He says that non-'Uthmanic codices are known to have survived until at least the tenth century. Moreover, according to Gilliot ("Creation," p. 48), "the treatment by al- Farrã' (d. 207/822) of the variant readings from Ibn Mas'üd shows that in his time they could be discussed in equal terms with the 'Uthmãnic text." 54 Versteegh, "Greek Translations," p. 64. 55 Forstel, Arethas und Euthymios Zigabenos und Fragmente , pp. 16 and 86. 56 Fred Leemhuis, "Readings of the Qur'an," in Encyclopaedia of the Quťan , ed.

However, the pleonastic demonstrative pronoun in the relative clause is found in all parts of the Septuagint and in the New Testament (where it is especially sug- gested by Semitic usage), and it was also present in the Koine:58 for example, Genesis 1.11, oii то okeq'io. аитой (literally, "of which its seed"); Mark 7.25, yuvfi . . . , fjç bIxbv to GvycxTQiov auxfjç jrv8í3[ia àxá0aQTOv (literally, "a woman whose her young daughter had an unclean spirit"); and Oxyrhynchus Papyri 117, lines 15-16 (a letter of the second or third century), èÇ &lt;bv ôcóqbiç xotç Jtaiòíoiç aou Bv в^ aùxœv (literally, "of which please give to your children one of them").59 The second feature is the rendering of the emphatic infinitive absolute by the fi- nite verb with cognate object, "which leads to most un-Greek sentences," ac- cording to Versteegh, who cites, among others, fragment 64, xai èòa'iáoa'iev avxovç ôá[xaaiv, literally, "we conquered them a conquest" (Sura 17.16, fa - dammarnãhã tadmïran 'We destroy them utterly '). But this method was also used regularly by the Greek translators of the Hebrew Bible, and it "is not foreign to the spirit of the Greek language."60 It is also found in the New Testament, where it is "more likely to be a Hebraism such as is found in the LXX, through the influence of the infinitive absolute."61 Therefore, these two features suggest only that the translator was familiar with these earlier translation techniques or at least with these phenomena in biblical and other texts. These features also reveal the translator's endeavor to be as literal as he could. However, it is true that some features of the translation's language invite spe- cial consideration. Erich Trapp has drawn attention to some demotic words such as "ôai^ioviáQiç, ôajtítiv, axuMv, oqôivoç, xaßaXaQiog, xafxr|aia, á^Xcovco, BJtáva) instead of ŮJtBQ."62 He has also shown that Euthymios Zigabenos substi- 57 Versteegh, "Greek Translations," pp. 64-65. 58 See F.

Fragment 77 is a good example: although Nicetas's and the anathemas' version have the demotic form xaßaX,(X)aQtfru£ 'riders', Zigabenos offers the formal ê&lt;p' UTJioiç 'those on horseback'. The syntax of the translation is generally demotic, but to some extent this may be the result of the translator's attempt to be as lit- eral as possible. Very striking words include ôiácpauojxa (daybreak)63 in frag- ment 111, OQvevovTai (they are adorned)64 in fragment 69, and гкохаощос, (re- bellious)65 in fragment 79. The Greek Word Holosphyros (óXóoipvçoç) Let us now return to the Greek word that the translator used to render the problematic al-samad . Holosphyros is not a common word in ancient and me- dieval Greek. It is first attested in the fourth-century b.c. rhetorician and sophist Alcidamas, in a fragment where the word is applied to coinage and means "made of solid beaten metal";66 it is then found in the Oneirocritica of Artemidorus (sec- ond century) with the same meaning, this time applied to rings.67 Later on, the Neoplatonic philosopher Hermeias of Alexandria (fifth century) uses the adjec- tive of a gold statue,68 and John Malaias (sixth century) employs it to describe small busts of Ares made of solid lead.69 In all these cases, holosphyros is a syn- onym of holosphyratos (óXoocpÚQaxoç, Ionic сЛоасртЗртусод), a slightly more com- mon word,70 which is applied to a vessel of hammered gold (in the Septuagint book of Ecclesiasticus or Sirach, dated to the second century b.c.),71 to a statue 63 Earlier attested five times only, first in the Protoevangelium of James and the Life of Secundus the Philosopher (both of the second century). See the Diccionario griego-español , ed. Francisco R. Adrados (Madrid, 1980-), s.w. 0их&lt;раица and бихсраиаца. 64 Cf. the Latin orno , ornare 'to adorn'. The Greek term occurs only once elsewhere, in the Visio Danielis, attributed to John Chrysostom, ed. A. Vassiliev, in Anecdota Graeco-Byzantina (Moscow, 1893), p. 36, lines 30-31, 7toir|oei xaxaoxevfjv Jik)ia)v xai opvevaei airea 'he will build ships and adorn them'. This text was also written in the ninth century; see Lorenzo DiTommaso, The Book of Daniel and the Apocryphal Daniel Literature , Studia in Veteris Testamenti Pseudepigrapha 20 (Leiden, 2005), pp. 96, 155-58, and 362-63. 65 Only twice elsewhere, in Epiphanius's Panarion (fourth century) and the Basilica (ninth and eleventh-thirteenth centuries), each time with a different meaning. 66 Alcidamas, fragment 2 (Odysseus), line 133, ed.

The word ótaxKpUQOi (holosphyroi) is a varia lectio here; L (Florence, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, MS plut. 87.8, eleventh century) offers а&lt;рирг|А.ато1 ( sphyrëlatoi ), a synonym of holosphyroi. 68 In his commentary on Plato's Phaedrus, ed. Paul Couvreur, Hermeias von Alexandrien: In Pla- tonis Phaedrum scholia (Paris, 1901), p. 45, line 8. A few lines below (p. 45, line 20) he refers to the same statue as осрирт^атог) àvÒQLávTOç, with sphyrëlatos used again as a synonym of holosphyros. 69 In his Chronographia , ed.

Holosphyros is composed from oA,oç (whole) and f| acpüQa (a hammer) and means "beaten out entirely with a hammer," hence "massive," "solid," "not hollow." The word oc- curs only once with a different meaning, "with undivided ankles" (in this case composed of oXoç and xò cupuQÓv 'ankle'), when applied to animals by Aris- tophanes of Byzantium (in his Epitome of Aristotle's zoological writings).74 Although the word in its main meaning certainly comes from a metalwork context, it is important to examine any cases where either holosphyros or its synonyms are used in a metaphorical sense. There are several metaphorical uses of sphyrelatos (0(pvQï'kaT0&lt;; 'wrought with the hammer'),75 which is again a com- moner synonym of holosphyros . As noted above, it is used scornfully as a syn- onym of holosphyros in the concluding sentence of the anathemas. Sphyrelatos is used metaphorically (wrought as of metal) first by Pindar, fragment 207, (j(puQT]X(XTOiç àváyxaiç (hammer-forged compulsions);76 Plutarch also applies the adjective to cpiÀía ("solid- wrought friendship," Moralia 65c) and voDç ("firmly forged sentiment," Moralia 408e),77 while Pseudo-Lucian (In Praise of Demos- thenes 14, written after the second century) applies it to X,óyoç ("words with the strength that comes from the craftsman's hammer").78 But an instance of ho- losphyratos by the fourth-century Christian bishop Epiphanius of Salamis is more suggestive because the word is applied to man. Epiphanius argues that the bib- lical phrase "the Lord God formed man" (Genesis 2.7), which does not say that God formed inside man a liver or lung or heart or veins or nerves or the rest that is in the body, does not mean that man is a single, massive, and homo- geneous entity:79 Пара toDto vot|go[íbv ev ti eivai óX0(xpvQr'T0v tòv avÖQomov, ôià то 'ii] Хглтоцвдшд TT)v crúv0eaiv той jtcxvtòç Çcoou tt]v yQa(pf|v ХглтоХ.оулоса; oí) JiávTcoç. 72 Hermann Beckby, ed. and trans., Anthologia Graeca: Griechisch-Deutsch, 3, 2nd ed.

Certainly not.] This example is offered in support of his argument that we should not take the phrase xai ó Aóyoç aàQÍ; èyévexo ("and the Word became flesh," John's Gospel 1.14), which does not include the soul, as suggesting that Christ had only flesh and no soul. Epiphanius argues that Christ had both flesh and soul. This exam- ple is useful because a synonym of holosphyros is being used to express the sense of a solid, homogeneous entity applied to man, a material, yet not metallic, ob- ject.80 A case of the word holosphyros may also be cited at this point: in a compila- tion of astrological texts found in Rome, Biblioteca Angelica, MS gr. 29, 81 the star of Venus is described as yé^iov, íoxuqóv, óXóo&lt;pupov (full, strong, and ho- losphyros ), while Anabibazon (the ascending node) is described as yéjxov ôè xai óXóocpuQOV (full and holosphyros ). In contrast, Mercury is 'ir' yéfxov (not full), and the Sun is ovte (ìt^y yé|iov oike xoücpov exet ôè ÔJtr|V (neither full nor hol- low, for it has a hole).82 Although this may not be an entirely metaphorical use of the word, the context clearly reminds one of the legend from al-Tabarfs Taf- sir about the solid (samad) Lord and the hollow man (cited earlier in this arti- cle). The juxtaposition of holosphyros to yé[iov (full) and íax^QÓv (strong) and its contrast with |nf| yé^iov (not full), xoi3&lt;pov (hollow), and e/ei órcr|v (it has a hole) are particularly suggestive. Epiphanius's use of holosphyrëtos (a synonym of holosphyros) and the use of holosphyros in the above-mentioned astrological texts could help explain the choice of holosphyros to translate samad. As noted above, samad at some stage acquired the meaning of "something which is . . . without hollowness . . . , i.e., consisting of one, solid . . . entity." There should be no doubt that this was a known meaning of samad since the eighth century83 and certainly by the time the Greek translation was made. As also previously noted, this interpretation of samad was found problematic by Muslim commentators because it could imply that Allah is material. It is fair to conclude at this point that the Greek transla- 80 G. W. H. Lampe, ed., A Patristic Greek Lexicon (Oxford, 1968), s.v. оХоофяЗратод, followed by Franco Montanari (Vocabolario della lingua greca , 2nd ed. [Turin, 2004]), incorrectly takes óXoocpiJQTyuoç ( holosphyrëtos ) in Epiphanius as referring to the "unity of body and soul in man." The main argument of Epiphanius (which is about the unity of body and soul in Christ) has been confused with his example of man (and Genesis 2.7), cited in this paragraph. 81 As David Pingree has shown ("The Astrological School of John Abramius," Dumbarton Oaks Papers 25 [1971], 189-215, at pp. 203-4), the texts (a mixture of Hellenistic and early Byzantine texts with Greek translations from the Arabic) were falsely attributed to a nonexistent Palchus by the compiler and scribe Eleutherios Zebelenos, who completed this manuscript in Mytilene in 1388. "Palchus" is a Greek translation of the Arabic al-Balkhl (meaning "from Balkh").

The translator was both well educated in the Greek language and aware of Muslim interpretations of samad. In fact, it is likely that he was aware of more than one Muslim interpretation for samad , possibly through the exegetical literature, and he made a choice. His translation is additional tes- timony for the understanding of samad by contemporary or earlier Muslims. It has also become evident that when holosphyros or a synonym is used with God, man, or abstract nouns, it has a metaphorical meaning; the translations often given by scholars fail to realize that, although the Patristic Greek Lexicon offers the correct meaning.84 Given that nothing is known about the Greek translator of the Qur'an, one should allow for the possibility that, had he known the Syriac language, he could have had suggestive evidence for the meaning of samad. Sebastian Brock has drawn my attention to the similar Syriac root smd, which could mean "bind up" or "compress," as well as the word smãdã, rendered "colligatio, compactio" in R. Payne Smith's Thesaurus Syriacus.85 It is known (but sometimes forgotten) that people from the Syriac churches were the earliest translators from Greek into Arabic at the turn of the eighth/ninth century, right at the beginning of the "trans- lation movement."86 Versteegh, who, as noted earlier, thinks that the translator was not a native speaker of Arabic or Greek, speculates that he could be a Syr- ian Christian whose native language was Syriac;87 my view is that the transla- tor's native language is more likely to have been Greek, and this could certainly apply to a Syrian Chalcedonian.88 The Case of al-cAlaq (Sura 96.2) Before looking further at the question of the Byzantine understanding of ho- losphyros, it is worthwhile to consider briefly another often-cited example from the Greek translation of the Qur'an. The Greek translator has been criticized for apparently rendering al-calaq (Sura 96.2) as bdella (ß0eXX,a), meaning "leech." Sura 96.2 is translated by Abdel Haleem as "he created man from a clinging form , " which he explains as "a stage in the development of a foetus (cf. 22.5), 84 Lampe, ed., Patristic Greek Lexicon , s.v. óXóocpVQOç: " made of solid beaten metal Jo.

All these meanings involve the basic idea of clinging or stick- ing."89 Nicetas accuses the Quťan of teaching that man comes from a leech ( Confu- tatio 1, lines 90-92): Xiyei, oil èx pôéMrjç ó âvOQcojtoç yívexai (he says that man is created from a leech). The phrase is then picked up by Zigabenos, who finds it absurd; chapter 28.15 (lines 347-49)90 of his Panoplia Dogmatikè tés Ortho - doxou Pisteos (The Doctrinal Armory of the Orthodox Faith ) reads as follows: 'Ex pôéM/nç &lt;xv0Q(DJiov yíveaGai Àiyei.

But how could the most honorable come from the least honorable and the rational from the reasonless and what is desired from what is avoided?] Commenting on Nicetas's statement, Meyendorff says that this is an "example of a misunderstanding due to a faulty translation."91 Sidney Griffith cites the same statement as "a small example of a polemically rendered meaning of an Arabic word in the Qur'ân" and observes, "The reference is to a verse in al-cAlaq XCVI:2, 'halaqa 1-insãna min ealaqin/He created man from a germ-cell.' The Arabic word al-calaq has a variety of meanings, among them are 'leech,' 'blood clot,' 'germ cell.' It requires a knowledgeable person to exploit for polemical purposes the double entendre inherent in the use of the Arabic word."92 Versteegh thinks that calaq was translated as "ßödXXr) 'leech' (708B), possibly because of a confusion with the word ealaqa9 which does have this meaning, although it seems more prob- able that in this case the translator could not resist the temptation to ridicule the Islamic revelation."93 Al-Calaqa appears in Sura 22.5: People, [remember,] if you doubt the Resurrection, that We created you from dust, then a drop of fluid, then a clinging form ( al-'alaqa ), then a lump of flesh, both shaped and unshaped.

For evaluating this translation it is important to take into account that "leech" was a clear meaning of both words and that modern Quťanic commentators who understand the words as meaning "blood clot" "have universally acknowledged the leech-like qualities implied by the mention of blood clot in these verses."95 Abdullah Yusuf Ali translated al- calaqa at Sura 22.5 as "leech-like clot," and Ali Quii Qara'i translated both words as "a clinging mass."96 At least one modern Islamic scholar, Abul Kalam Azad, has preferred to understand al-calaqa as meaning "leech."97 It is possible that a similar view was also held by early Muslim commentators known to the Greek translator.98 Another possibility is that the translator could not think of an exact Greek equivalent for the meaning (as he understood it) of al-calaq and al-calaqa in the Qur'an and considered bdella as the closest equivalent. The Byzantine Understanding of Holosphyros as a Translation of al-Samad Nicetas of Byzantium Nicetas of Byzantium refers to Sura 112 and holosphyros three times in his Gonfutatio.

Waugh, "Blood and Blood Clot," in Encyclopaedia of the Qur'än (above, n. 56), 1:237- 38. 96 Ali, The Holy Koran (above, n. 18); Ali Quii Qara'i, The Qur'an : With a Phrase-by-Phrase En- glish Translation (London, 2004). 97 Sikandar Hussain, "The Clot (al-calaq)," Islamic Quarterly 24 (1980), 107-10, at p. 109: "'cAlaqa' also means a ' Leech' On the 24th day after fertilization the embryonic disc becomes elongated with a head-fold and a tail-fold. These folds give the embryo the shape of a leech. Maulana Abu'l Kalam Azad preferred this meaning and based his argument on the assumption that 'leech-like' organisms constitute one of the stages on the 'scale of organic evolution.' " 98 It is worth mentioning that Geneviève Gobillot, who also understands al-calaq and al-calaqa (both rendered as "une chose suspendue") as a stage in embryonic development, parallels the Qur'anic pas- sages with some lines from a Greek work entitled To Gauros on How Embryos Are Ensouled 10.3, transmitted under the name of Galen but attributed to Porphyry (third to early fourth century). The embryo is described there as suspended (èxxQejxéç) by a pedicle.

Forstel, in his re- cent edition of Nicetas's work, corrects holosphairos in Confutatio 24, line 25, but not in Confutatio 1, line 82, when Nicetas says:99 E'iç ¿lèv öeoXoyiav xaúxT]v eqqt]§8 xf]v aöeov (pwvr|v, oil ocpaiQixóv boti tò 0elov, HãMov ôé, (bç aúxòç efotev, oXóo&lt;paiQÓç èaxiv ó 0eóç, o(ò'ia Jtávxoç aúxòv oíó^ievoç* oí&gt; y àQ âv âXÀwç xò xfjç OípaÍQaç èôéxexo 2&lt;paîQa òè í&gt;Xixf| xax' avxòv xvyxávwv огЗхв àxoúaexai oi3xe õipexai vorjxœç, òt]X.ovóxl ойхе èvegyr) oei jiáXiv, e'i Jtov xi3x°l ^aQ' aKkov xlvt]08Íç xai цакоха xaxà Jipavouç àXoyíaxcoç (péQSO0 ai. [In the area of theology, (Muhammad) uttered this godless statement, that God is spher- ical or rather, as he said, God is all-spherical ( holosphairos ), undoubtedly thinking of him as a corporeal substance; otherwise, he could not have a spherical shape. Being then, according to him, a material sphere, he [God] will neither hear nor see mentally, that is, nor will he act again, if he happens to be moved by someone else and is even moved irrationally downhill.] But in this case also it is likely that holosphyros is the original reading, because with "or rather, as he said" Nicetas implies that what Muhammad said (that is, holosphyros) may not be an exact synonym of "spherical"; however, that is how he was inclined to understand it. That Nicetas read holosphyros in his transla- tion of the Qur'an is made absolutely clear in Confutatio 18, lines 144-48: Tò ехахо oxòv èvòéxaxov ^v0áQiov e/ei ovxœç* "Ebié, auxóç èoxi 0eòç slç, 0sòç óXóocpuQoç.

[The one hundred and eleventh myth reads as follows: "Say, he is God the one, God holosphyros. He begot no one, nor was he begotten, nor is anyone comparable to him." If holosphyros does not indicate the shape of a sphere, but the quality of solid and com- pressed, this is also a characteristic of a corporeal substance.] It is also obvious that the translation of the Qur'an is not Nicetas's own, and he struggles to understand it. He is inclined to believe that holosphyros means holosphairos , although he is not absolutely certain. The way Nicetas mentions the alternative meaning ("solid and compressed") gives the impression that it had been expressed by someone else and was not Nicetas's own idea. Because of Ni- cetas's misunderstanding of the word, the corruption of the obscure holosphyros to the easier holosphairos would be very easy.100 However, it would still be pos- sible for Nicetas to refer to holosphyros in other parts of his work as holosphairos , by citing his translation of the word. Although Nicetas does not seem to have done so, scribes replaced holosphyros with holosphairos a few times in his writ- ing, and later authors who drew on his work refer to the God of Islam as being holosphairos 'all-spherical'. The emperor John VI Kantakouzenos (1347-54), who, "Nicetas, Schriften, ed. Forstel (above, п. 8), Confutatio 1, lines 81-86. 100 In Vat. gr. 681 the forms óXóo&lt;p£QOç ( holospheros ) and óX.óocpaiQog ( holosphairos ), instead of óXóacpuQOç ( holosphyros ), also appear in the title of Confutatio 24 in the table of contents and the text. Forstel has rightly corrected the words in both cases.</page><page sequence="18">904 The Greek Translation of the Quťan in addition to his Historiae, wrote treatises against Islam, also refers to the God of Muhammad as being holosphairos ; his statement is worth citing in full:101 eO öiaßoXog à0£oç, xai xaxà rcávx a ojioioç оитф ó xfjç àmoXeíaç uíòç ó Maxoú^Ex. 0eòv у àç) JiQOGTtvvéi xai xtjqúxxei óXóacpaiQOV xai ipuxQÓxaxov, ©eòv nQOOKwéi xòv [д,т|Х8 yevvr]0évxa цг|хе y£vvr|aavxa 'ir' vor|aaç ó ôsíXaioç, öxi aã&gt;p,a jtQoaxuve! xai ov 0eóv. eH yàg ocpalpa elôoç oco^iaxóç èoxi xai f| jioióxtjç ошцаход.

[The devil is separate from God, and all the same applies to the son of perdition, Muhammad. For he worships and proclaims a God who is holosphairos and very cold;102 he worships a God who was not begotten nor did he beget, without realizing, the wretched one, that he worships a corporeal substance and not a God. For the sphere is a corporeal shape and the coldness a quality of a corporeal substance. With his God who did not beget nor was he begotten, he worships neither a corporeal substance nor an incorporeal and true God, but one who is invented in the dreams of the impious. It is altogether ludicrous to glorify a sun that has no light and a fount with no water and a mind with no thought - let such a God perish!] Kantakouzenos is obviously indebted to Nicetas of Byzantium. His copy of Nice- tas should have had holosphairos instead of holosphyros at least once.103 Later on, the emperor Manuel II Palaiologos (1391-1425) also says that the Christian God is "not holosphairos" (o v% ôXóocpaiQOç) and that Muslims believe that "God, who has no form, is holosphairos " (óXóacpaiQOV vo^ií^ovxa xòv àaxTluáxiaxov ©eóv).104 In addition, in a passage of Bartholomew of Edessa discussed later in this article holosphairos is attested as a variant of holosphyros. As the title of Nicetas's work suggests, his objective was to unmask and ridi- cule the Qur'an. Whatever one makes of his polemical tactics,105 these should not be confused with the translation of the Quťan and its accuracy. In the case of samad! holosphyros Nicetas seems to exploit a Qur'anic passage that had al- ready caused difficulty and perhaps embarrassment to Muslim commentators. He prefers to understand holosphyros as meaning all-spherical, which is a mistake, although he is aware of the correct meaning of the word (Confutatio 18, lines 147-48, xò JTUXVÒV xai rcemXriiievov 'solid and compressed'). It is possible that 101 Contra Mahometem 4, lines 360-68, in John Kantakouzenos, Christentum und Islam: Apolo- getische und polemische Schriften , ed. and trans. Karl Forstel, Corpus Islamo-Christianum, Series Graeca, 6 (Altenberge, 2005). 102 "Very cold" is possibly used metaphorically here; I would prefer a meaning of "indifferent," i.e., "apathetic," "unmoved," or "insensible," to Eichner's "leblos" ("Nachrichten" [above, n. 52], p. 159).

Yet it is also possi- ble that the erroneous translation of holosphyros was not a deliberate misinter- pretation but a failure to understand correctly an uncommon and difficult word. As I will show below, the word's obscurity for the Byzantines would be con- firmed in the twelfth century. Forstel suggests that the similarity between holo- sphyros and holosphairos facilitated the confusion between them.106 Euthymios Zigabenos In chapter 28.9 (lines 189-94)107 of his Panoplia Dogmatikë Euthymios Ziga- benos (fl. c. 1100) copies Nicetas verbatim when he says that the Qur'an óXócKpuQOv Xéyei xòv 0eóv, rjxoi ocpaiQixóv.

[says that God is holosphyros , that is to say, spherical. This is the shape of a corporeal substance, and it indicates a corporeal substance, as does the quality of solid and com- pressed. Being then, according to him, a material sphere, he (God) will neither hear nor see; and he could be moved downhill randomly and rolled down disorderly.] It seems that Zigabenos does not realize that the "quality of solid and com- pressed" represents a different understanding of holosphyros . Manuel I Komnenos and the Synod of Constantinople In 1180 the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos (1143-80) made an at- tempt to remove from the conversion ritual the last anathema against the holo- sphyros God of Muhammad.108 According to the Byzantine historian Nicetas Choniates (ca. 1155/57-1217), the abjuration of Allãh was a stumbling block to Muslims wishing to convert to Christianity, and Manuel wanted to make their conversion easier.109 Apparently both the emperor and prospective converts to Christianity thought that the same God is worshiped by Christians and Muslims 106 Forstel, Arethas und Euthymios Zigabenos und Fragmente (above, n. 46), p. 57 n. 20. 107 The corresponding PG reference is 130:1341В. 108 See Charles M.

Papadopoulos-Kerameus, in Analekta Hierosolymitikès Stachy-</page><page sequence="20">906 The Greek Translation of the Quťan and thus the true God was being placed under anathema.110 The emperor pre- sented his arguments to the synod in the form of a synodical letter for approval. The synod, presided over by the patriarch of Constantinople, Theodosios Bora- diotes (1179-83), rejected the document. The emperor was very critical of the synod's response and insisted on his views by presenting a shorter, rhetorically embellished document for approval. The synod rejected this letter as well but in the end agreed that the anathema of Muhammad's God would be replaced with an anathema of Muhammad and his teaching. During the second meeting of the synod, Choniates reports that an outburst of the learned archbishop of Thessa- lonica Eustathius against the emperor's request was due to the fact that Eusta- chius "could not tolerate that the true God would be called a holosphyros fab- rication of a demoniac mind" ('ii' èveyxoòv 0eòv ctXriGivòv ovo|iáí¡ea0ai oXóoípuQÓv ti ôiavoíaç àvájtXaajxa xaxoôaíjiovoç). Choniates mentions holosphyros several times in the course of this story when he refers to the God of Muhammad. Interestingly, Manuel is reported as being unable to understand the meaning of holosphyros (xai akkwç ôè |lxt| aimévai, ÓJtoiov xi èoTiv то ôXóacpuQov). Choniates seems to be fascinated by this myste- rious word, and he gives the impression that, although its meaning was not en- tirely clear, the term was part of the problem. Craig Hanson has assumed that "undoubtedly knowledgeable Muslims, potential converts or not, had long ob- jected to the blatant, derogatory mistranslation of the divine epithet samad as 'made of solid, hammer-beaten metal.'"111 However, this view is not supported by the sources, and Choniates makes it clear that the major problem was the anathema against God.112 The role of the word holosphyros in the controversy was not important, and this is clarified in the second document, which was even- tually accepted by the synod. According to this document, the last anathema was initially added to the ritual:113 a'ia 'ikv on exelvoç tout' oòtò tò ôX.óo(pi)Qov ладебоуцат^е tòv 0eòv ojote tecoç tolç tòte VEVÓ^iiOTO, ä'ia ôè xai ÖTL лХ-ЕТата 'ivaaç)à xai arcoßXriTa òià Tfjç лад' аитой EiOEvrjvEY^Evriç ßißXov тог) KoQCiv naQaôéôœxE toîç |яг] |j,a0íiTOVnévoiç ai)Tá.

[partly because with the term holosphyros he (Muhammad) taught a false doctrine about God - at least it was thought so at that time - and partly because by his introduction of the Qur'an he taught very many abominable and unacceptable things to people who had not learned them. But those of the Muslims who approached the divine baptism and as is the custom were catechumens, when they were about to pronounce the anath- ema concerning the God of Muhammad, they always hesitated to do this, being cau- tious in explicitly anathematizing God by his name for various reasons including that they were rather rustic and unversed in letters and had absolutely no idea about what holosphyros means. For a holosphyros God is no God, a thing that the Muslims testify that they do not know about, even though the author of the catechetical book thought otherwise.] The synodical letter clarifies again later that the anathema was removed "be- cause those who approach the divine baptism and others are scandalized by the naming of God" (ôià xò xoùç jtQoaeQXOjxévouç хф Oeícp ßajtxLa|iaxi xai êxéQouç ôxavôaXíÇeaOai ètti xf) хогЗ ©eoi) лдооцуодщ).114 Although it seems that Choniates and the bishops were intrigued by holosphy- ros, the word did not play a major role in the controversy of 1180, as Darrouzès has pointed out.115 It is thus not very accurate to refer to the incident as "the holosphyros controversy" (Sahas and Hanson)116 or to assert that Manuel advo- cated "a doctrine known as holosphyrism" (Steven Runciman).117 We should no- tice, however, that holosphyros had a negative meaning for the bishops, al- though it is not reported how exactly they understood it. From what is reported (especially the phrase of the second synodical letter that "a holosphyros God is no God"), one gets the impression that holosphyros would describe for them a material God. Bartholomew of Edessa Almost nothing is known about Bartholomew of Edessa, the author of a Con - futatio Agareni. He probably lived in the twelfth century, although an earlier date should not be excluded.118 Bartholomew apparently refers to pre-Islamic gods when he says that "the morning star Zebo, Aphrodite, Cronus, and Chamar" 114 Ibid., p. 197, lines 38-39. 115 Ibid., p. 191. 116 Sahas, "Holosphyros," pp. 114-19; Hanson, "Manuel I Comnenus," pp. 66, 73, 75.

Klaus-Peter Todt, Corpus Islamo- Christianum, Series Graeca, 2 (Würzburg, 1988), pp. xlv-xlvi.

Klaus- Peter Todt notes that the way in which Arabic words are cited here casts doubt over Bartholomew's knowledge of Arabic and the Qur'an.121 Todt may be right about the Arabic language, but I see no reason to doubt Bartholomew's knowl- edge of the Qur'an on the basis of this citation. Samad is understood as holo- sphyros and perhaps holobolos (beaten solid) as well, a synonym of holosphy- ros . It should be noted, however, that holosphyros is the reading of Leiden, Bibliotheek der Rijksuniversiteit, MS Scaligeranus 21, which was copied in the second half of the sixteenth century.122 Moscow, Historical Museum, MS gr. 436, written between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, offers holosphairos. It is hard to decide about the original reading in this case,123 but Bartholomew clearly understands holosphairos or holosphyros as a qualification of a material God. Other Byzantine Translations of al-Samad Did John of Damascus Translate al-Samad? John of Damascus (c. 660-c. 750) is the first Christian theologian to offer a synopsis of Muhammad's teaching. The synopsis starts as follows:124 119 Confutatio Agareni 5, lines 8-12 and, for the following quotation in the text, lines 13-17. See also Khoury, Polémique (above, n. 10), pp. 60 and 341-44; and Eichner, "Nachrichten," p. 236. 120 Christopher Melchert (letter of January 11, 2010) thinks that Tzamet "seems most likely to be an alternative transliteration of samad with tz substituted for emphatic s and unvoiced t for voiced d." According to the Patristic Greek Lexicon (s.v. óÂ.ópoXoç), what we have here is "a play on Ar- abic samad (u), unchanging, sâmit(u), firm , solid." Todt has no comment in this regard. 121 Confutatio Agareni , p. 106. 122 This manuscript was copied by the great humanist and classical scholar Joseph Justus Scaliger (1540-1609). 123 For the Moscow manuscript and the variant holosphairos see Todťs edition of the Confutatio Agareni , pp. 173-75 and 177. Todt became aware of the Moscow manuscript when his work was completed; his edition is based on the Leiden manuscript only. He cites the readings of the Moscow manuscript in an appendix, and Karpozilos, in his review of Todt (above, n. 118), offers examples of better readings in the Moscow manuscript. 124 De heresibus 100, lines 17-20, ed.

[He says that there is one God, creator of all things, who has neither been begotten nor has begotten. He says that Christ is the Word of God and his Spirit, but a creature and a servant, and that he was begotten of Mary without seed, the sister of Moses and Aaron.] John draws here from various Qur'anic passages. Bonifatius Kotter's testimonia for these lines offer Sura 112.1 and 3; 4.171; xxioxóv (creature) 3.59; ôoíjXov (servant) 4.172; 43.59; èx Maçíaç (of Магу), for example, 4.171; 19.34; 43.57; and àôeXxpíjç (sister) 19.27-28. Kotter was careful not to include Sura 112.2 in his testimonia for the first line but only 112.1 and 3. However, he should have cited Qur'anic passages for the notion that God is the creator of all things: for example, Sura 13.16, "Say, 'God is the Creator of all things: He is the One, the All Compelling'" (see also Sura 6.101-2, 39.62, 50.38, and 59.24).125 Hanson, however, following an older view of Sahas, suggests that "the words creator of all indicate John of Damascus' translation and understanding of the crucial word samad." Versteegh also considers Jioirixriç xœv ötaov 'creator of all things' to be John's "interpretation" of Sura 112.2.126 That is not so. There are different Arabic words in the Qur'an for the notion "creator of all," and no such meaning is attested for samad . John of Damascus simply does not translate or interpret Sura 112.2 at this point; instead he draws on other passages of the Qur'an where God is described as creator of all. Theodore Abü Qurrah and John the Deacon Theodore Abü Qurrah (c. 755-c. 830) was a Melkite bishop of Harran. He was one of the first Christians to defend Christianity against Islam and the first known author who wrote Christian theology in Arabic.127 He also wrote in Syr- ney H. Griffith, The Church in the Shadow of the Mosque: Christians and Muslims in the World of Islam (Princeton, N.J., 2008), pp. 40-44. 125 For more parallels see John of Damascus, Écrits sur l'islam , ed. and trans.

Both Hanson and Versteegh refer to Sahas, John of Damascus (above, n. 12), p. 77 (with n. 6): "John of Damascus translates [samad], 'God the Creator of alP" (n. 6: "We believe that John of Damascus in 765 A translates, indeed, and not simply interprets, or distorts the verse"). In his 1995 article "Ho- losphyros" (above, n. 4), p. Ill, Sahas apparently changes his mind and asserts that John of Damas- cus "summarizes faithfully the essential teaching of Islamic monotheism and of Sura 112" and that "he avoided tampering with the Qur'anic idiom of samad" But he does not mention his earlier view, which had been followed by Versteegh ("Greek Translation") in 1991 and would be followed by Hanson ("Manuel I Comnenus") in 1996 and implied in 2000 by Goddard ( History [above, n. 105], p. 39). 127 See Lamoreaux, Abü Qurrah (above, n. 15), pp. xi-xxv; and Griffith, The Church in the Shadow of the Mosque , pp. 59-62, 90, and 97 n. 76.</page><page sequence="24">910 The Greek Translation of the Quťan iac; the works preserved in Greek under his name are more likely to be transla- tions from Arabic.128 Glei and Khoury have now proved that a number of dia- logues in Greek were apparently written by a certain John the Deacon.129 John asserts in a preface that he was an eyewitness to Theodore's debates and that what he offers is a report of them. Lamoreaux has shown that only nine of the seventeen dialogues found in some manuscripts were part of John's original work.130 For his recent translation of these works, Lamoreaux often consults im- portant manuscripts not used by Glei and Khoury.131 Lamoreaux has also shown that John the Deacon made direct use of Theodore's Arabic works.132 In his Opusculum 20, part of the original corpus, Abü Qurrah is reported by John to argue that Muhammad was God's enemy and was also possessed by a demon (I also cite here Glei and Khoury's apparatus for 0(puQÓttr]XX0ç [sphyro- pëktos ] and àvTi^i8Qioxr|ç [antimeristës] ):133 гХгуг yàg òcujiovarv öxr ó Geóç (is àjcéaxeiXev èxxúoai то схцш xwv ^Qeaßeuovxcov xò 0ELOV cpúoiv xQicrujtóoxaxov, xaL Jtávxcov xcõv 'ir' ойхсо Xeyovxcov ó 0sòç ^louváÇ, ó 08Òç CKpvQÓJtrixxoç [sphyropëktos], oç oůx 8YévvT]oev ovòè ёугуут]0г] ovòè yéyovev а тф otvxi(i8QLôXT|ç [antimeristës] xiç.

Instead of holosphyros in verse 2 we have sphyropëktos (ocpvpójrrixxoç) and instead of homoios (o^ioioç, "sim- ilar" or "equal") in verse 4, we have antimeristës (àvxi|ieQioxf|ç, "partner"). What is really remarkable is that this is the only instance in which these two words are 128 Sidney H.

It is worth mentioning that Friedrich Sylburg, the editor of the conversion ritual for Muslims (1595), had already understood holosphyros in a similar way, as indicating a ^ovojtQÓowjiov 0£Óv ("a unipersonal God," i.e., consisting of a single person) in contrast to the Trinitarian Christian God; see Sylburg, Saracenica (above, n. 34), p. 115.</page><page sequence="25">The Greek Translation of the Quťan 911 recorded in Greek literature. In his attempt to render the Qur'anic terms accu- rately, the translator composed two hapax legomena. Antimeristès renders the Qur'anic term kufu (printed in almost all modern Qur'ans) or kufu3 (a variant reading). The translator seems to have been well in- formed about the understanding of this term by Muslim theologians. Kufu in mod- ern translations of the Qur'an is usually rendered as "equal," "comparable," or "like." Uri Rubin observes that kufu3 appears in Arabic sources in the context of matrimonial arrangements and that, according to exegetic traditions recorded by Muslim commentators, kufu3 in Sura 112.4 "must be taken not merely as a mate for matrimonial relations, but also as an associate in one's divine rank."135 An- timeristès literally means "one who claims a share." Sphyropëktos means "built compact with a hammer," that is, "consolidated" or "well-built."136 It is basically a synonym of holosphyros, although the two words could perhaps have slightly different connotations. Holosphyros could de- scribe better the condition of being "solid," while sphyropëktos might also con- vey (at least to a higher degree than holosphyros) the process of solidification. But it is unlikely that any such difference would be felt by the translators since both words have the same metaphorical meaning when applied to the Islamic God. It is also significant that both words represent different and most likely in- dependent attempts to render samad . The arguments used earlier in this article about the careful and knowledgeable choice of holosphyros as a translation of samad apply to sphyropëktos as well. Moreover, the successful rendering of ku- fu3 as antimeristës confirms the high quality of the translation made or cited by John the Deacon. The two Greek hapax legomena per se and their knowledge- able use as renderings for samad and kufu3 suggest that the translation was com- posed very carefully. However, it is important to notice that sphyropëktos and antimeristës are the readings of A (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, MS gr. 66, sixteenth cen- tury), while Y (Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS gr. 1111, eleventh century) offers crceiQÓJtri&gt;a;oç ( steiropëktos ), "barren-built," and àvxi^eQi^vriTr|ç ( antimerimnëtës ), whose possible meaning is discussed below. Lamoreaux has now added the evidence of two other old witnesses, which also offer steiropëktos: Mos- cow, Historical Museum, MS gr. 231 (932), and Mount Athos, Vatopedi, MS gr. 236 (eleventh century). Lamoreaux adopts steiropëktos and notes, "The term 'barren-built' seems to be either a deliberate mistranslation or a misunderstand- ing of the Quťanic term samad (usually translated as 'eternal' or 'absolute')."137 However, two considerations are significant when deciding whether sphyropëk- tos or steiropëktos was the original reading. First, the older manuscripts, includ- ing the Moscow one, which was copied for Arethas of Caesarea roughly one hun- dred years after Theodore's death, are not free of mistakes. In fact, the Moscow 135 Rubin, " Al-Samad and the High God" (above, n. 21), p. 210. 136 Cf. E. A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman and Byzantine Periods (Cambridge, Mass., 1887; repr. 1914), s.v. офирояг^хтод. For the formation of the word cf. егЗлтраод (well-built) and ейлаулд (compact, firm), as well as OípVQOXOJtéw and o&lt;pVQOXTiméo) (beat with a hammer). 137 Lamoreaux, Abü Qurrah, p. 224 n. 79.</page><page sequence="26">912 The Greek Translation of the Quťan manuscript has the corrupt version of the title of the dialogues, which has long confused scholars because instead of "as reported by John the Deacon" it says "as reported by John of Damascus."138 Second, steiropëktos and antimerimnètès are odd hapax Greek terms, which would not have been composed indepen- dently but only as "corrections" made on sphyropëktos and antimeristës. Steiro- pëktos means nothing more than steiros (ateipoç 'barren'), while the meaning of antimerimnëtès is probably "the one who cares in turn."139 Glei and Khoury do argue that Y represents an early arbitrary editorial revision ("eine frühe willkür- liche Bearbeitertätigkeit"),140 and they mainly follow A in their edition of the di- alogues.141 A seems to represent an early hyparchetype, and this is indeed an ap- plication of the well-established maxim recentiores, non deteriores (the more recent manuscripts are not necessarily the worse ones). Conclusion A careful examination of the early Muslim understanding of samad in Sura 112.2 and the Greek words holosphyros and sphyropëktos suggests that the lat- ter are not deliberate mistranslations of samad in order to prove that Muslims believe in a material God, as various scholars have suggested. The words, which could mean "solid" or "massive" and are often mistranslated by scholars, have been found to be accurate and knowledgeable renderings for samad and in fact testify to an early Islamic understanding of this term. I have also argued that in the text of John the Deacon (which summarizes the teaching of Theodore Abü Qurrah) the variant reading steiropëktos (barren-built) for sphyropëktos, re- cently adopted by Lamoreaux, can only be understood as a "correction" of sphy- ropëktos. The ninth-century Greek translation of the Quťan, although not without mis- takes, is generally accurate, and evidently the translator consulted both lexico- graphical and exegetical material. However, relatively few fragments of this trans- lation survive, and it is not possible to say how often the translator consulted Qur'anic commentaries. Some features of this translation have mistakenly been taken by Versteegh to suggest a non-Greek translator. It is also often not realized that consideration of early Islamic exegeses and variant Qur'anic readings is es- sential for a complete assessment of the translation's accuracy, which should be carefully distinguished from the sometimes faulty understanding and polemical tactics of later Byzantine theologians writing against Islam. 138 Lamoreaux, "Theodore Abü Qurrah," pp. 363 and 370. 139 See Lampe, ed., Patristic Greek Lexicon , s.v. àvxi^iEQifAváo): "саге in turn, Eusebius, fragment in Luke 12.22 (Patrologia Graeca 24:560C)," and Trapp, ed., Lexikon zur byzantinischen Grä- zität, s.v. HEQifxvr|TQia ("Fürsorgerin"). 140 However, the correction of sphyropëktos 'well-built, solid* to steiropëktos 'barren-built* seems to reflect either awareness of a similar Islamic understanding of samad or simply a correction in the light of what follows in the text (Sura 112.3, "He begot no one nor was He begotten"). One also wonders whether the original modification of sphyropëktos was to sterropëktos ((ru£QQÓjrr|XTOç 'solid- built'), which was then changed to steiropëktos. 141 Glei and Khoury, Schriften zum Islam , p. 68.</page><page sequence="27">The Greek Translation of the Quťan 913 As for holosphyros: the word was apparently misunderstood by Nicetas of By- zantium, who thought that it meant holosphairos (all-spherical). Nicetas's under- standing of the term was possibly influenced by his polemical intentions, but it is also possible that he simply exploited the enigmatic samad , which had been subjected to successive reinterpretations by Muslim commentators who wanted precisely to eliminate any implications of a material God. Nicetas was influen- tial in later Byzantine literature on Islam, and his misunderstanding of samad was followed by Euthymios Zigabenos and John VI Kantakouzenos. The general accuracy of the Greek translation and the apparent use of exeget- ical literature for its preparation are paralleled in the first Latin translations of the Quťan. Both Robert of Ketton in the 1140s and Mark of Toledo in 1209-10 generally made an effort to produce fair and accurate translations of the Muslim holy book, despite their polemical viewpoints. Although Robert's translation is "by no means flawless," there are "relatively few signs of obvious polemical dis- tortion," and his work was also informed by investigation of the Islamic exeget- ical tradition.142 Mark of Toledo also made use of Muslim exegesis, but only rarely, and as a result "at times ... his guesses about the meanings of obscure terms in the Quťan led to comic results."143 In fact, any attempt to translate the Quťan without the help of commentaries would lead to serious defects, due to the Qur'an's complex language, with many rare words and difficult constructions, as well as elliptical passages. In John Wansbrough's words, "Quranic narrative is nothing if not elliptic, often unintelligible without exegetical complement."144 The use of léxica and commentaries on the Quťan by the Byzantine translator confirms his serious attempt to convey to Greek readers an accurate sense of the Quťanic text. 142 See Burman, Reading the Qur'än (above, n. 31), pp. 29 and 36-40.
