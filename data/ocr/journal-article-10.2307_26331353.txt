<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Role of the Incarnation in Christian Literary Theory Consideration of the rise of theologically oriented literary crit icism in this century leads, I think, to the conclusion that the Incarnation is a doctrine central to this criticism. Its influ 8ence can be seen with regard to such important matters as: (1) the theological evaluation of culture and art; (2) the problem of "angelism"; (3) the relationship between Christianity and the modes of tragedy and comedy; and (A) the implications of the new theol ogy of secularism and futurism. 1 Historically significant is the fact that certain emphases in twentieth-century theology have corresponded to emphases in twentieth-century literary criticism. These correspondences, due in part to the cultural milieu common to both disciplines, have</page><page sequence="2">in turn probably had something to do with the emergence of various Christian theories about literature. Protestant theology after World War I was characterized by the Neo Orthodox disillusionment with the optimistic and evolutionary tendencies of nineteenth-century theology. The early Barth, for instance, emphasized that salvation was entirely from God, Who annihilates the religious and cultural pretensions of man. In this country Reinhold Niebuhr also took a dim view of the modern trust in human progress, pointing to the doctrine of the Fall, which stresses the limitations and perversities of man's nature.1 The major literary critics of the early decades of the century had an equally pessimistic view of man and his culture. T. E. Hulme, for example, in his famous Speculations posits a strict dualism between the divine perfection and human imperfection. T. S. Eliot was also suspicious of human nature and of modern secularism: he held, in "Tradition and the Individual Talent," that the creative process is an escape from personality; and his later call for a theological criticism of literature in "Religion and Literature" is based on the feeling that religious standards in a post-Christian age must supplement purely artistic standards. Another "cultural pessimist" was F. R. Leavis, who saw literature as the preserver of "health" in an ailing society. These critics influenced by Leavis's Scrutiny criticism—men such as George Every and S. L. Bethell, sometimes lumped together into the school of "Christian Discrimination"—supplemented the negativism of Leavis with a strict, conservative Anglo-Catholicism.2 The criticism of two principal American "New Critics," Allen Tate and Cleanth Brooks, displays many of these same attitudes, at least in the later stages. Both Tate and Brooks at first assert the autonomy of literature to separate it from moral and religious concerns; but their criticism subsequently becomes less restricted and reveals an increasingly theological stress on man as fallen and limited but capable also of love.3 So far I have mentioned theologians who have rejected culture in the oame of God and critics who, although interested in man's</page><page sequence="3">cultural expressions, are affected by similar misgivings. There are, however, other critics with more sympathetic views of culture and art, views which can be categorized under three headings: (1) natural theology, (2) theology of culture, and (3) theology of incarnation and secularity. Perspectives of the third type are, as I hope I can indicate, the most satisfactory, for they allow the theological critic to do the most justice to the work of literature. Natural theology has been for centuries important in Roman Catho lic thought and is evident today, to cite one case, in the aes thetic of the French writer Jacques Maritain. Maritain sees ar tistic inspiration coming, ultimately, from God, but as a gift of the natural realm, tending towards the making of artistic objects and not towards the seizing of absolute divine truth, which is a matter of revelation alone. Other Roman Catholic critics also speak of natural theology: Harold Gardiner states that literature deals with the "natural" virtues of faith, hope, and charity; Martin Turnell and Arthur Machen hold that literature provides a partial apprehension of the spiritual truth which dogma embodies most satisfactorily. Drawing on the strong tradition of natural theology in Anglicanism, the Cambridge theologian H. R. Root calls for its revival to save Christianity from an irrational fideism: the creative arts can be the propaedeutic to natural theology by imparting a sense of the "inwardness" of modern life.^ The lim itation, as I see it, of theories based on natural theology, is that they follow the traditional distinction between the super natural and the natural. To many modern thinkers this distinction is outdated and arbitrary, and relegates the human, the "worldly," lo to an unacceptably second-class position at the very time they want to affirm the human and the worldly. The theologians of culture view art as significant to the Chris tian as expressive of the cultural situation to which the Gospel must be addressed. Paul Tillich regarded art as possessing a "religious" dimension of "ultimate concern" which reflects the temper of the period out of which it comes. Amos Wilder goes even further, asserting that in a time in which the Church timid ly disengages from the world, the grace of God can be perceived</page><page sequence="4">as working "incognito" in the writings of individuals not formal ly religious.5 The limitation of cultural theologies is that they, like the New Criticism, tend to look at literature as ev idence for the alienation and spiritual dislocation of modern man. What is missing is a strong enfranchisement of the concrete ness of the world and of man's positive experiences in it. 2 In contrast, critics whose thinking is profoundly affected by the implications of the Incarnation are able to deal more affirmative ly with the world, and are able to avoid either subordination of it to some other realm or condemnation of it. Some critics, such as E. J. Tins ley, G. Wilson Knight, and Leicester Bradner, notice that the Incarnation is dramatic and concrete, replete with sym bol and metaphor, like the literary form. The Dutch writer Ger ardus van der Leeuw, writing from a Barthian viewpoint, surpris ingly enough concludes that in the form of the crucified and resurrected Christ we have the justification for all human at tempts to create form, including art.^ This is the repeated as sertion of Christian critics who agree with Marita in and Tate that the temptation of much modern art has been to "angelism," the attempt to avoid contact with the specificities of experience by withdrawing to the inner psychic life or by some sort of "poesie pure" to turn away from the created order and directly perceive the Absolute. In the face of this tendency Nathan Scott, for one, pleads for the poet "to glory in our human infirmities and to turn once again to the finite with the sense of wonder and expectancy and with love and a proper adoration."? And the Jesuit writer William Lynch protests against both the "univecal" imagination which destroys all variety and detail for the sake of unity, and the "equivocal" imagination, which sees only vari ety and unrelatedness. He advocates instead the "analogical" imagination, by which the idea "adapts itself to every detail . . . without ever suffering the loss of its own identity"; the model for Lynch is the Incarnation, in which the infinite descends into finitude.8</page><page sequence="5">3 The Incarnation and its implications for the relationship between the infinite and the finite are, further, often important in Chris tian discussions of tragedy and comedy. The story of the life, death, and resurrection of Christ is used both to prove the in compatibility of faith and the tragic mythos, and to prove their compatibility. Commentators such as Karl Jaspers, Reinhold Niebuhr, and David Daiches Raphael argue that tragedy presents man in a fallen state, facing or even rebelling courageously against a hostile universe which defies his comprehension and crushes him, whereas resurrection and the Christian hope lift the believer in some sense beyond such a condition. In direct contradiction, such critics as David E. Roberts and William Lynch see that God's full •haring in the human condition is the pattern for the tragic di lemma, and that to insist on an "easy resurrection" is to escape from human existence into comedy and romance. Some critics take positions somewhere between these extremes. J. A. Bryant and Roy Battenhouse argue that tragedy is essentially the Old Testa ment story of fallen man, whereas the full New Testament story transcends tragedy. Nathan Scott contends that tragedy is an interim possibility, for the Church still awaits the final ful fillment at the end of the age.^ There is less theological theorizing about comedy, but one does encounter the feeling that the Christian religion and comedy are incompatible, for Christianity is deadly serious, having to do with salvation and damnation, while comedy deals only with human IX inconsistency and folly. 10 But here, as in the discussion of tragedy, Lynch and Scott assert that precisely because of the Incarnation and its affirmation of the world, comedy in the Chris tian era has been able to scrutinize man closely and realistically,: mercilessly exposing as ludicrous his pretensions to self-pity or fastidiousness. Nelvin Vos, in his book The Drama of Comedy, refuses to apply one Christian theory to all comedy; instead he sees comedies as falling into several patterns which recapitulate, partially or wholly, the story of Christ in His defeat and vic tory.11</page><page sequence="6">4 Clearly the concern of incarnational criticism has been to legit imize the "worldliness" of literature, its involvement in the complexities and ambiguities of human life; and to counter pres sures towards otherworldlineSs. It is of some interest, then, that this movement "to the world" has also become the major di rection of theology during the past few years. Though not pri marily literary critics, the "radical" theologians of the mid I960's often adduced literary documentation for their analyses of a "secular" culture for wh'ich the old God, on whom man could lean and who could be used to explain the gaps in human knowledge, was irrecoverably dead.12 So far did these men go in rejecting any sense of transcendence, in fact, that Nathan Scott rather wistfully hoped, at one point, that the experience of transcend ence might possibly be rediscovered in contemporary literature.13 But just as Nathan Scott was fearing a static and hopeless inaa nentism, a new group of theologians, Europeans such as Jürgen Moltmann, Wolfhart Pannenberg, Johannes Metz, and the American Harvey Cox, were commencing once again to proclaim the good news of hopefulness. Their futuristic-eschatological perspective does not, however, constitute a withdrawal from the present age, On the contrary, these "theologians of hope" are very interested in the human situation in our time; in fact, they are likely to talk of "revolution," to press for fundamental changes in the appli 13 cation of technology and in political and economic structures Now this development raises an important question for the Chris tian critic. We have seen that the directions of theology and literary criticism have often been parallel during the twentieth century. Is this no longer the case? In the past, theology and literary criticism have concurred in a pessimistic attitude about man and his world. Creative literature, too, was likely to deal with man's "extreme" situations of death and despair, and in the face of the collapse of religious belief the poet struggled to . construct meaning from human experience. But according to Nathan Scott in his newest book, Negative Capability, the attempt to</page><page sequence="7">focus or mythologize experience is being abandoned by the present generation of writers, notably the French practitioners of the nouveau roman. To their theoretician, Alain Robbe-Grillet, the notion of imposing order on reality is a kind of anthropomorphism which is to be rejected in favor of a disinterested attention to surface factuality. Scott speculates that these writers may be avoiding the risk of "angelism" inherent in the attempt to infer ideas and patterns from human experience, and are instead dis playing a radical openness to the world, an awareness of what Heidegger regards as the holiness of Being in the realities of the earth.15 This is, as Scott points out, surely a watchful stance, though it also seems entirely passive and lacking in the spirit of active optimism which permeates the new theology. More encouraging to me is a just-published indictment by Leslie Fiedler of present-day literary criticism for taking itself and literature too seriously, and pandering to gentility and aca demicism. Fiedler asserts that to understand what is happening we should look to the "anti-literature" of pop culture: the Western, science fiction, and pornography (such as Portnoy's Complaint). He continues that the recent work of such authors as Kurt Vonnegut, Norman Mailer, Anthony Burgess, and John Barth is not dedicated to rationality or Jamesian artistry but to the ecstatic vision, the dream, to a new and unorthodox propheticism, to "a continuing revelation appropriate to a permanent religious revolution, whose function is precisely to transform the secular crowd into a sacred community, one with each other and equally at home in the world of technology and the realm of wonder."16 Like the theology of hope, Fiedler's essay reveals a sense of ex pectancy and comes to terms with the impact of technology on the modern consciousness. And for all its free-wheeling rhetoric it does discern a religious dimension that Scott fails to perceive. The Christian critic may charge that Fiedler is essentially up dating the Arnoldian prediction that poetry will be the religion of the future. Nonetheless, his observations about the religious quest of the new literature merit careful consideration, for they, along with similar insights in the theology of hope, testify to a fundamental alteration in the contemporary view of life and art. Furthermore, the Christian critic should ponder Fiedler's argument</page><page sequence="8">&amp; that the age of academic criticism is over, and that in an age of a new romanticism the critic will think of the poem not as words on a page to be rigorously scrutinized, but "words in the world, or, rather, words in the head, at the private juncture of a thou sand contexts—social, psychological, historical, biographical, geographical--in the consciousness of the reader (delivered, for an instant, but an instant only, from all those contexts by the ekstasis of reading) The Christian critic will, of course, add that one of the contexts—perhaps the most inclusive context— is the religious. Failure to respond to the challenge of the new theology and the concurrent new literary sensibility would, it seems to me, con stitute a reversion to anti-worldliness, as well as a refusal to recognize that the Incarnation entails full involvement in present human life and thought, and full confrontation of literature which, according to an ancient aesthetic theory, imitates life.
