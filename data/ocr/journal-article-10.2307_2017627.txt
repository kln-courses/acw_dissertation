This closely-reasoned theological essay can be regarded from at least three aspects-as a general justification of theism, as an argu- ment for one version of theism, and as a critique of some traditional theistic dogmas. The dominant theological conception of God as absolutely simple, purely active, non-temporal, non-emotional, and all in all absolutely perfect, Hartshorne considers metaphysically erroneous and irreligious in its implications. In elaborate develop- ment of certain strains characterizing recent neo-Protestant and panpsychistic theology he offers a conception of God as perfectible, temporal, partly passive, and suffering. God 's essential trait is love. By affirming "the necessity of a division of powers, hence of responsibilities, as binding even upon a maximal power" (p. 30), Hartshorne copes with the problem of evil. The view that God's goodness and perfection are wholly unaffected by the good or evil in the world he condemns as profoundly immoral, as sophistically implying that "really there [is] to be no service of God, but only a service of men through the-to them-beneficial practices of religion" (p. 48), that evil as well as good contributes to the glory of God. Hartshorne's theism entails a greater than ordinary amount of anthropomorphism. But he willingly embraces this, maintaining that the concept of God can not be given significant content except in terms of human and social analogy. The world is God's body. He is the supreme mind and force of the cosmic organism, a view the author calls "panentheism." Panpsychism is central to the argu- ment, and from its assumption follow many judgments concerning the properties of deity. The assumption of deity in turn is taken to support the conclusion of panpsychism. In its critical capacity, delineating the more subtle contradic- tions, vaguenesses, and non sequiturs of traditional theology, this book excels. If Hartshorne's own rationalism were as free from difficulties as such a judgment might suggest, the same could be said of the book as a whole. But a number of considerations sug- gest otherwise. (1) A distinction is repeatedly made between concepts gen- uinely " religious " and concepts " irreligious. " What criterion underlies this distinction-unless it be frankly personal intuition, -as well as the distinction between ideas "religious" and "secu- lar," is mysterious. It is certainly not a historical one, for the</page><page sequence="2">246 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY usage and procedure of historical orthodoxy are precisely what Hartshorne attacks. (2) The emphasis on the religious-secular distinction, along with other considerations, reflects a potent will-to-believe influence in the formation of Hartshorne's conclusions. This in itself is not the point, but rather Hartshorne 's apparent unawareness of its influence in determining his metaphysical and moral preferences. Sometimes this influence comes to the surface: "At this I for one can not do other than say no! Give me some other God or none. The whole point of religion is destroyed" (p. 117). A familiar note indeed, but Hartshorne's failure to make explicit this factor in his methodology favorably accentuates the critical self-conscious- ness of Kant and James. (3) There is a pronounced tendency in this book to turn con- troversial matters into obvious facts. Thus Hartshorne takes the idea of greater and less in value to be one "than which none could be more elementary in philosophy" (p. 18). Were this true with respect to ordinary issues, it would still be fantastic to affirm it as Hartshorne does in connection with the meanings of "deity" and "perfection." Elsewhere we discover another alleged common- place: "The notion that physical pleasure is enjoyed by the bodily cells, and participated in by us, is not a mere hypothesis, to be indirectly verified, but, like all philosophical ideas, is a hypothetical description of the immediately given" (p. 152). (4) Some of the arguments for panpsychism (required for the conception of cosmic organism) illustrate the a priorism that re- mains the bane of philosophy. If God is essentially love, Hartshorne reasons, nothing "can be incapable of being loved"; but "dead matter" would have to be incapable of being loved (p. 205). Or consider this: The assumption of God requires the assumption of maximum beauty in the universe. Now "there must be a balance of likeness and difference, of similarity and contrast, if there is to be beauty" (p. 212). But "a contrast as this between the living and the dead, that which has feeling and that which has none, is not beautiful" (p. 214). Ergo, panpsychism. (5) If the world is God's body, and God is love, it follows that any possible object of God's love is a part of his body. None of the author's dialectical refinements (and there are many) seem to abolish this conclusion. It may be, of course, that he does not regard it as awkward or "irreligious," for he does not even state it in this way. But that it is discordant with the poetic fervor of his theory of divine love is clear, and especially clear when we recall his view that ideas of deity can be given meaning for us only in terms of human analogy.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK NOTES 247 (6) In a discussion of the bearing which the present war has upon the religious ideal of love, Hartshorne concludes that love necessarily implies social realism and social awareness. In this way he not only feels able to explain divine specialization of sym- pathy but condemns dogmatic pacifism. The independent logic of Hartshorne's theism is here admirably reflected. But it goes hand in hand with the customary appeal to authority, and his attempt to harmonize this theory of love with the intent of Jesus meets with the customary embarrassment. The injunction to "resist not evil" (Matthew) is not, like an ecclesiastical or philosophical dogma, transformed by a resolution to avoid "literal absolutism" (p. 171). Hartshorne considers his rationalism scientific, as do rationalists in every age and clime. Those who share his methodological temper and agree upon the first principles he thinks are first will be im- pressed by the meaty texture of his discussion, especially perhaps by a revivified ontological argument stated as strongly as that argu- ment can be. Those who can not accept theism or his version of it will be more impressed by the sincerity and religious feeling that prevail throughout. JUSTUs BUCHLER. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
