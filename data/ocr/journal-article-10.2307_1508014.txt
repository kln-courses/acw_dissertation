<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW VOLUME XXIX JULY, 1936 NUMBER 3 GOD AND THE MORAL LAW JAMES BISSETT PRATT WILLIAMS COLLEGE THE subject for our annual conference 1 this year - Ethics and Theology - forces us to face one of the most difficult problems of religious thought, - the relation between God and morality. To this problem several solutions - all quite familiar - have been proposed and it will not be the purpose of my paper to sug- gest a new one of my own. In fact, as the sequel will show, I am very uncertain whether any completely satisfactory solution to the problem be possible. My aim is the much less ambitious one of placing the matter, with some of its difficulties, before the Society for discussion, in the hope that your collective wisdom may be able to throw more light upon this dark theme than the Society's benighted president for this year - who is no theolo- gian - is able to contribute. One of the simplest and most popular modes of conceiving the relation between God and the laws of morality is to equate righteousness with obedience to the divine will. God is good, we are told, and our goodness is to be defined as conformity to the will of God. One relatively superficial and pragmatic diffi- culty in accepting this view consists in the obvious fact that it is by no means easy to know with certainty what the will of God may be. Different philosophers, different prophets, different religions give us different and sometimes quite contradictory answers to this question. If, moreover, ethics must wait upon metaphysics, if we cannot be sure that malice and cruelty are evil until we have proved the existence of God and have dem- 1 The American Theological Society, to which this was delivered as the presidential address in April 1935.</page><page sequence="2">154 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW onstrated the truth of one of the many opinions about God's will, plainly all united moral effort will be put back many hun- dreds of years. The attempt to define morality by identifying it with the will of God has its theoretical as well as its pragmatic difficulties. Few thinkers in our day are likely to attempt an answer to our question concerning the content of the divine will by citing the authority of the Scriptures or of the Ten Commandments. The days of absolute authority are past. It may, however, be suggested that in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, whom all Christians and large numbers of non-Christians accept as the supreme type of moral goodness, we have a way of discovering the nature of the divine will in no way dependent on authority, and acceptable to unprejudiced men of all religions. Jesus, the one perfect man among all the sons of men, was unique: and hence it would be at least a rationally justifiable faith which should see in his life and his teaching the human expression of the will of God. It is not unnatural that this argument should have a wide appeal, and nearly all of us, I think, would gladly find in it the solution of our problem. It is therefore a bit disap- pointing to note that this comforting answer begs the entire question. For be it recalled that our original problem was the definition of morality by means of the will of God. Now the proposed solution, so far as it does anything, defines the will of God by means of morality. The only reason why Jesus is thought to represent and express, in unique fashion, the divine will, is because he is conceived as uniquely good. That means, of course, that we have antecedently a conception of moral good- ness to which he conforms and but for which the assertion of his goodness would be meaningless. The unique goodness of Jesus, if we know what we mean by it, may conceivably be used to indicate to us the divine will; the divine will cannot be used to indicate the unique goodness of Jesus. In short this, and I believe every other, attempt to use the will of God as a criterion for defining morality will be found on analysis to be based either on dogmatism or on a petitio principii. It may be said, however, that while the will of God is not capable of being used as a practical criterion of moral goodness,</page><page sequence="3">GOD AND THE MORAL LAW 155 it is still possible that in reality it is, even though unknown by us, the fundamental principle of righteousness. Even in human courts of justice ignorance of the law is no excuse for transgres- sion of it. Our uncertainty as to what the will of God may be need not make it the less true that conformity to it constitutes moral goodness. When the position is put in this fashion the question at once arises whether God wills a given form of con- duct because it is good, or whether it is good because God wills it. And the necessary answer is of course immediately obvious. The upholder of what we may call the will of God theory of ethics is precluded from saying that God wills an act because it is good; for that answer would assume that morality is definable antecedently to God's will. He is therefore bound to say that an act is good because and only because God wills it. It is in this form, as a matter of fact, that the clear thinking upholders of the doctrine in question - I have in mind notably Augustine and Calvin --have viewed the matter and have expressed themselves. The doctrine, therefore, amounts to this: that the word "goodness" is to be defined as that which God wills, no matter what it may be. The assertion that God is good becomes thus a redundancy, amounting only to the undeniable proposition that He wills what He wills. Doubtless this is a possible position. There is an element of the arbitrary in all definitions: and one may, fairly enough, propose a new meaning for an old term pro- vided one gives due notice of the new use and remains consist- ent with one's self. But while this is true, it is plain that if we accept the new meaning assigned to the term "moral goodness," we shall be precluded from showing that there is any obligation of any sort upon anyone for being morally good. The new defi- nition has, indeed, successfully united "goodness" to the will of God, but only at the cost of severing it completely from what is commonly known as moral obligation and from the rationally justifiable way to live. We grant, if you insist upon your termi- nology, that moral goodness equals, or is to be defined as, obedi- ence to the will of a Being who is to be called good in no other sense than that He wills what He wills (which also the devils do); but we want to be shown what obligation there is upon us</page><page sequence="4">156 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW to be good in this sense; or how obedience to this will (which for ought that the argument can show may be what we know as cruel and tyrannical) can be called rational or conducive to the values which we know as good. And you cannot successfully answer us unless you go over to some other ethical criterion - to some criterion which will put more content into moral good- ness than mere obedience to a will which only by meaningless tautology can be called good. The dependence of morality upon the will of God is put in a slightly different form by the so-called theology of Crisis; but the criticisms just cited against the Calvinistic formulation of that theory hold none the less decisively for it. According to the Crisis theology, as I understand it, there is but one essentially good act for man, and that is complete surrender to the will of God. It is not suggested - and could not consistently be suggested - that our duty thus to surrender is based upon or derived from the fact that God is good. God is God: that is all we know or need to know. God is separated from man by the chasm which it is heresy to deny. And human goodness, properly understood, is to be defined as the surrender of self- will and the correlative acceptance of the will of God, whatever this may be. Plainly such a view not only is open (as I have pointed out) to all the criticisms of the general doctrine thus far considered: it also suffers from the essentially anti-ethical corol- lary that this self-surrender (man's only good act) is never man's act at all, but the act of God alone. Man's sole moral act thus turns out to be no act of his but rather something that is done to him. This denial of the free choice of the good, and there- fore of moral responsibility and of the very possibility of human goodness, is a striking and natural (though not a necessary) reductio ad absurdum of the attempt to define moral goodness solely by reference to God's will. I conclude, therefore, that ethics cannot wait upon theology. The objection may be made that in my argument I have pre- sented a crude theology and a far too anthropomorphic God; and it is possible to insist that while morality cannot be de- rived from this kind of deity, it may well be derived from a more inclusive and more philosophical type of God or Absolute,</page><page sequence="5">GOD AND THE MORAL LAW 157 and that though ethics need not wait upon the somewhat naYve type of theology suggested, it may and does and must wait upon a tenable and profound metaphysics. Goodness, it is said, - and Beauty as well - is an objective value, in no wise depend- ent upon subjective conditions, and in no wise man-made. It is a standard or ideal, and as such it is absolute and possesses objective validity of such a sort that we as rational beings ought to conform to it. The obligation resting upon us is absolute. Morality is thus no merely human affair, nor is it to be known in simple empirical fashion. It bears upon its face an unescap- able necessity and is derived from the fundamental nature of Reality as such - in other words from God. Thus ethics is dependent upon metaphysics, or, what is the same thing, upon a truly philosophical theology. "In bringing value into exist- ence," writes Dr. Sorley, "the individual person is conscious of a standard or ideal which has validity as a guide for his personal endeavor, or an obligation which rests upon him. The attain- ment of value is recognized as a value only because of its con- formity with this standard of law or value, or because of its ap- proximation to this ideal of value. It follows therefore that the value or goodness actually achieved in personal life implies as its ground or condition a standard or ideal of goodness. Accord- ingly we are compelled to form the conception of an ideal good or of a moral order, which, as the condition of actualized good- ness, must also be regarded as in some sense having objective reality.... Ultimate reality must include it. By ultimate reality is not meant material existents or even the realm of per- sons, but that which is the ground of everything that is real. .. . The recognition of the moral order and of its relation to nature and to man, involves the acknowledgment of the Su- preme Mind or God as the ground of all reality."' The difficulties under which this doctrine suffers are the gen- eral difficulties which the whole Kantian point of view in ethics has to face. These, as I see them, are vagueness, lack of specific content, and the substitution of words for clear thought. In the first place the notion of an absolute obligation owes what per- suasive quality it possesses to its indefiniteness. If someone 1 Moral Values and the Idea of God, pp. 508-514.</page><page sequence="6">158 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW challenges the obligation and asks for proof, it is hard to see what reply can be given save recourse to dogmatic authority or "intuition." And if the intuition and the authority are not ac- knowledged, nothing more can be said. Moreover, if it be true that I am under obligation, the obligation must be specific. If I really ought to do something, there must be something definite that I ought to do. A mere obligation in general is meaningless. Similarly a standard must be specific if it is to be a standard. It must be namable and definable: a standard of specific conduct, a definite principle of action for human beings. Otherwise it is nothing but words. Now if the standard and the obligation are specific they must be relevant to, applicable to, and in part derived from human nature, human values, and human conduct. It is human conduct that the principles of ethics are about. A meaningful moral principle or standard cannot be derived from some Idea of Obligation as such. If it is to have content which in any intelligible sense is really relevant to human conduct it must be dependent for its nature on man and his values. It can no more be derived from the ultimate nature of Reality than from the will of an anthropomorphic God. An ethics that has nothing specific to say about human conduct reduces to the tautology that we ought to do what we ought to do. An ethics that has something specific to say - an ethics that possesses content and is capable of being in any way a guide to action or a means of distinguishing good conduct from bad - can wait upon metaphysics as little as it can upon theology. The attempt to set up a Realm of Values that shall be eternal, objective, self-existent, and independent of human life and of finite experience, not only shares all the difficulties of an ex- treme Platonic realism which would make essences and uni- versals "real " in some unspecified and mythological sense: it must also face the dilemma of either giving its values no dis- tinctive meaning, or else of deriving their meaning altogether from the actual world of which they are said to be independent. An example of the first of these difficulties is to be found in Windelband's position, which, in effect, tells us that the thing we ought to do is the Good, and then defines the Good as the thing we ought to do. While such an attitude toward values plainly</page><page sequence="7">GOD AND THE MORAL LAW 159 makes ethics incapable of speech, the other horn of the dilemma presents difficulties no less great. Hartmann, for example, in the first volume of his (translated) Ethics removes values to a purely subsistent and ideal realm, even more remote from human experience than are the essences of mathematics, and insists upon their self-existence, objectivity, and utter inde- pendence. Things and experiences are good only because of their relation to values; and values get none of their nature from their relation to desire or liking. "Nothing," he tells us, "is ever loved or striven for except for the sake of some value immedi- ately discerned. But conversely, never is loving or striving pre- supposed in the case of a thing that is of value. That this re- lationship is irreversible lies in the very constitution of acting, loving, desiring. It is essentially a one-sided dependence. But what is evident in it is the fact that values possess the character of genuine essences, the character of absoluteness, of principles, and that the knowledge which we have of them can be no other than aprioristic knowledge." 1 Values, therefore, as Hartmann insists in his first volume, are in no wise dependent for their being or nature upon desire or any other human or existential state or condition and are known a priori. When, however, in Volume II the question is raised what specifically these values may be, which are so absolutely self-existent and independent of all actuality, the list presented us contains Life, Consciousness, Activity, Suffer- ing, Freedom of the Will, Happiness, Material Goods, Traffic, Language, Education, All Mental Goods --and even such specialized things as "the spiritual value of the house where one was born." Surely Stanton Coit, Hartmann's translator, showed an admirable prudence in putting into separate volumes these extraordinarily antithetical assertions; one would think that when mixed, even in a German volume, they would con- stitute a quite irresistible explosive. As I see it, therefore, it is not possible to derive morality from a non-empirical and independent Realm of Ideas or Values; and this holds whether we make our hypothetical values entirely self-existent and independent, or place them, somehow, within 1 Vol. I, p. 189.</page><page sequence="8">160 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW the mind of God. In neither case can we derive ethics from metaphysics; in neither case can we derive morality from God's mind or will. And not only so. If it were possible and if we suc- ceeded in the attempt so to derive moral goodness, we should be precluded, as we have seen, from maintaining in any significant sense that God is good. He might indeed be "good" in the un- specified and distinctly non-human sense of Sir William Hamil- ton or Mr. Mansel; but, as John Stuart Mill showed us long ago, to attribute goodness in this sense to God is to say exactly noth- ing at all. But this raises a new and very troubling question: can we say with genuine significance that God is good? Is it really thinkable that God should be good; and if it be, then in what sense can He be good? I need hardly remind this company of the position maintained by many profound thinkers both Eastern and Western, both Hindu, Buddhist, and (in some sense) Christian, that morality is but a human affair, applicable neither to God nor to the condition of just men made perfect, illumined souls who have passed beyond our realm of petty interests: that when morality is perfected it destroys itself: that, in short, it must be transcended and must pass into re- ligion. The question whether morality must be transcended, and whether the moral category can in any way apply to the Divine, may well be answered in different senses according to the mean- ing we attribute to morality. When Oriental thinkers insist that morality must be transcended, they usually have in mind a set of excellent conventional rules. Bradley conceives of morality as consisting essentially in the overcoming of evil, and Bosanquet thinks of it as a realm of claims and counter claims. Now if morality be taken in any of these senses, it is plain that its own complete success would prove to be essentially unsatisfying, or actually suicidal. It is not, however, in any of these senses that I have been using the word. For me morality means the ration- ally justifiable way of living. More specifically, it is a mode of conduct on the part of persons capable of choosing, so directed as to create or preserve the maximum of value. Is morality in this sense of the word eventually unsatisfying, self-destructive, in need of being ultimately transcended?</page><page sequence="9">GOD AND THE MORAL LAW 161 There certainly are realms to which morality of the type in- dicated will not belong. The realm of the purely material and mechanical, the realm of the simply biological, the Platonic world of Ideals or definable natures, Santayana's "Realm of Essence" - are all examples of regions which in one sense may be said to "transcend" morality. Conscious choosers who are capable of evaluating and preferring constitute the essential condition of the moral. But to say that morality must be tran- scended because only conscious beings can be moral is to little purpose. The real question is whether in a world of conscious choosers of an exalted type, where the evils against which we men struggle have been transcended, morality also would be transcended. Bradley and Bosanquet have shown rather conclusively that in a world of illumined and exalted beings there would be no place for what seems to be connoted by claims and counter claims, and that when evil has been completely overcome the struggle against evil must cease. Must a morality based upon value also be transcended? The answer to this question will depend in large part upon the type of values which moral life is conceived as pursuing. I think that what is commonly known as "Evolutionary Ethics" - the ethics of so many non-religious reformers - when carefully scrutinized, will prove to be in need of that transcending which the critics of morality have so long insisted upon. Whether the goal set up by evolutionary ethics would be ultimately self-destructive is a question that admits of argument; but if it include only those types of value to which its upholders commonly appeal, I am convinced that it would fail to satisfy the human spirit, and that the finer type of mind, the deeper kind of person, would demand that it be transcended. And the same fate, I believe, would be in store for the consum- mation of morality depicted by many a Christian reformer of what is known as the Social Gospel type. It need hardly be said that I have here in mind only a limited number of those whose ethics is of the essentially social sort. You all recognize what I mean. For the Bonum Supremum is not infrequently depicted in terms that are either negative or essentially materialistic. It will be achieved, we are told, when social righteousness is uni-</page><page sequence="10">162 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW versal. There will be no more selfish individuals, no more hun- ger, no more slums, no wars or rumors of wars, no more quarrels over property, because Science and directed industry shall have given everyone everything that he wants. There will be no more toil because we shall let the machine do the toiling, no more strikes and lock-outs because everyone will be a joint owner with everyone else, no more prisons and police, for there will be no more criminals, no more courts and lawyers, for there will be nothing to go to law about and no one will want to go; there will not even be any more reformers, for nothing will need reforming. How do you feel about this picture? Certainly it has much that is beautiful, it includes many of the things that the best men of all ages have earnestly longed and striven for. For my own part I can contemplate it only with a sense of de- pression. Should this consummation devoutly to be wished arrive in our time, and should we know that the sort of thing I have put into my description was the only kind of thing possible for man, my prayer, I believe, would be, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace9"! And my still longing soul would exclaim with the Psalmist: "I have seen an end of all per- fection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad." Exceeding broad because it is written: "Thou shalt not live by bread alone." In short, the goal depicted by the merely Social Gospel would fail to satisfy human nature and would need to be transcended because it leaves out some of the most fundamental values of the human soul. These are the values of the more cosmic, the more mystic, the more religious sort. No organization of society and no accumulation and ideal distribution of material goods which fails to include the more spiritual values can permanently satisfy man, or be accepted by him as that far-off divine event to which the whole creation moves. And if morality is to be de- fined as conduct tending to bring about this purely social and earthly goal and nothing more, then it is true that morality needs to be transcended and can complete itself only in religion. But there is no reason why a morality of value should be limited to goods of materialistic, or hedonic, or any other ex-</page><page sequence="11">GOD AND THE MORAL LAW 163 clusive type. All values that are or ever shall be loved by the human heart belong of right to the moral principle - the re- ligious values certainly no less than the others. I see, there- fore, no reason why morality in this wider sense need ever be supplanted by religion - though religion infinitely supplements it - nor why the spirits of just men made perfect, even in the beatific vision (so long as they retain the power of choice), need ever, or could ever, transcend the principles which here and now make possible the distinction between the better choice and the choice that is not so good. Similarly I see no reason for supposing that God, so long as we conceive Him to be characterized by will and by conscious choice, is above morality or precluded from being good. What reasons there may be for believing that God actually is good, or for believing that there is a God at all, do not form a part of the subject matter of this paper. But so far as I can see, there cer- tainly is no reason for asserting that the God of theism cannot be good. As I understand it, He is conceived as limited in His power or His knowledge and also in His being: He chooses and wills, He uses means to ends, He cherishes purposes and brings them about. A being such as this is certainly to be classed under the moral category. And if this conception of God brings com- plete satisfaction to the religious consciousness, we need go no further in our discussion of the relation of religion to morality. But the perplexing and somewhat disturbing query will arise in some of our minds as to whether this conception of God does bring complete satisfaction. And however you and I may personally feel about the matter, we cannot honestly deny that to many and many a deeply religious soul, this finite God with His limitations, this God "down in the dirt" whom William James held up to our view, this Jehovah-like Doer of Great Deeds, this Zoroastrian Enemy of the Evil, this strenuous Ally of the good man, this righteous Self among other selves, brings much the same sense of ultimate littleness and confinement and unsatisfied longing that the goal depicted by the merely Social Gospel produces in the hearts of most of us. We must, I think, recognize within the religious consciousness two factors, which I may refer to as the moral and the cosmic.</page><page sequence="12">164 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW The fully rounded religious man finds himself demanding at different times both that God shall be good and that He shall be without limitations - that He shall be the ultimate and com- plete Determiner of Destiny, the spirit immanent within the total cosmos, and not a Self among other selves. Different men find these two tendencies differently stressed within their hearts. The man whose interests are primarily of the moralistic sort - the man whom Friedrich Heiler would class among the "pro- phetic type" - longs chiefly for the finite God; the more mysti- cally inclined longs for the Infinite. The majority of Christian theologians have usually belonged to the former class, and they do today. This is true of writers as far apart as Wieman and Brightman. It goes without saying that Barth and his followers belong here. So also do Temple and Lyman and Tennant, and to some extent Boodin. But, as I have said, there always has been and presumably there always will be a group of deeply religious persons whom the finite God cannot satisfy: and many of us, I believe, when we closely examine our own hearts will find that while, on the whole, the hypothesis of the finite God may be the more defen- sible, there is still within us a sense of dissatisfaction and wist- fulness when we turn definitively away from the Infinite Divine. What I have in mind may be made more plain if I remind you of the experience you very likely had in seeing the play Green Pastures. Jehovah, you will recall, entirely good and immensely powerful, decides to "throw a miracle." He creates the earth, and places Adam and Eve and their descendants upon it. Years go by, and Jehovah discovers that all is not going as he had in- tended. He tries to reform earthly matters, but without com- plete success. Almost defeated, he destroys nearly all mankind by a flood, in order to make a fresh start. He seems able to do anything; yet he is always in part thwarted. It thus gradually dawns upon him - and upon the audience - that he has an environment, that there is being and potentiality besides him, and that out of this surprises come. Toward this formerly un- recognized environment with its unknown possibilities he comes to sustain much the same attitude that we men sustain toward</page><page sequence="13">GOD AND THE MORAL LAW 165 God. He learns - and we, the spectators, learn - that he is not the Determiner of Destiny after all; and it is brought home to us that only the Whole of things, the Totality of Being, can fully satisfy the cosmic element in the religious heart. The Jehovah of Green Pastures is, of course, crudely anthro- pomorphic, while the God of contemporary theism has been carefully cleansed of all crudity and is a very sophisticated Being. Yet it is a serious question whether even He - or It?- can give the cosmical or mystical side of the religious nature the limitless satisfaction that it craves. Let us consider two of the leading examples of recent theology. Certainly there is little enough that is anthropomorphic about Professor Wieman's God - who, you will recall, is defined as "that in the universe which will yield the maximum security and increase of human good when lives are properly adjusted to him. . . . How do we know that it is good?" (Professor Wieman is never quite certain whether God is masculine or neuter, and vacillates between "him" and "it " in a way somewhat bewildering to the reader.) We know that it (i.e., God) is good "because by definition it is that Something, however unknown, which would and which does bring human life to the largest fulfilment when proper ad- justment is made to it. .... We may not know what specifically its characters may be, but we do know that its goodness tran- scends the goodness of everything else in the universe." 1 God is, thus, far from being identified with the universe or the total- ity of Being. He is only one type of cosmic behavior, one aspect or tendency or process. He (or it) is "good," not indeed in the fully moral sense as a chooser of the highest values, but in the simpler sense of being good for us to make use of. Of the exist- ence of such a tendency - for that matter of several such ten- dencies - within the universe there can be no question; but there can be equally little question that the cosmically and mystically minded will find their souls' thirst all unquenched by the contemplation of this demonstrable situation. Brightman's God comes much nearer to satisfying both the moral and the religious demands of the human heart than does Wieman's. His God is "a conscious Person of perfect good will. 1 The Wrestle of Religion with Truth, pp. 59-60.</page><page sequence="14">166 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW . . . He is the creator of all other persons and gives them the power of free choice. Therefore his purpose controls the out- come of the universe. His purpose and his nature must be in- ferred from the way in which experience reveals them, namely as being gradually attained through effort, difficulty, and suffer- ing. Hence there is in God's nature, in addition to his reason and his active creative will, a passive element which enters into every one of his conscious states, as sensation, instinct, and im- pulse enter into ours, and constitute a problem for him. This element we call 'The Given.' . . . His will and his reason acting on The Given produce the world and achieve value in it." 1 Brightman's God arouses our worship, our love, and - our sympathy. Who can avoid feeling sorry for Him and giving Him the mead of our genuine fellow-feeling, when He struggles through effort, difficulty, and suffering, against The Given? We know in our measure how He feels, and He deserves our praise, for He is doing His best. So the spectator of Green Pas- tures sympathizes with Jehovah in his gradual discovery that he has an environment which limits him and that even he can- not make a whistle out of a pig's tail. We sympathize and ad- mire, praise and love; but can we not at least understand how many a deeply religious soul should, in the contemplation of this excellent and limited God, feel cabined, cribbed, confined? The sailor of the salty deep, whose life has been spent upon the high seas, may enjoy a few days of paddling about a calm and lovely lake; but if sentenced never to leave its waters, he will feel de- pressingly homesick for the measureless stretches of the ocean's endless horizons. And many a soul who has heard the call of the Infinite will feel a kind of cosmic nostalgia when we seek to satisfy him with the good and purposeful and finite God. It will be asked, and it should be asked, what kind of Being it is that would satisfy the religious soul who finds the finite God too small. The answer may well be that he can never be satisfied with any definable conception. The uses of the word "infinite" as applied to God are, as Tennant has pointed out, numerous and often vague. I think we may say, however, that those who insist upon infinity in the Divine usually make use of 1 The Problem of God, p. 113.</page><page sequence="15">GOD AND THE MORAL LAW 167 that adjective as equivalent to totality of being. For them it is intolerable that God, like the Jehovah of Green Pastures, should have an environment. This is another way of saying that for them God must be universally immanent. This means, I sup- pose, that nature is either the appearance or (in a sense) the body of God; and that between the Divine Life and our person- alities there should be an immeasurably more intimate relation than ever exists between two human souls. For those who feel thus about the Divine, the form of immanence in Nature which even Tennant's theism allows is not sufficient. God is immanent for Tennant in the sense that either intermittently or con- stantly, He acts upon the forces of Nature which He has made, in such fashion as to force them to work together for the accom- plishment of His purposes in a way which they would not do if left to themselves. Similarly God's relation to finite personali- ties is presented in a fashion which will seem to the mystic a little too external. For this type of religious nature God must be depicted rather more as the World Soul; or as the indwelling spirit of the Bhagavad Gita upon whom "this universe is strung as rows of gems upon a thread"; or as the "subtile essence" of the Upanishads, in which "all that exists has itself - It is the True, It is the Self. And oh Svetiketu, that art thou "; or finally, in the words of St. Paul, the Divine must be conceived as He "in whom we live and move and have our being." And this brings us back to the central question of this paper, from which we may seem to have wandered: God and the Moral Law. The finite God, we have seen, may well be considered moral. Can we say the same of the infinite God? If we take the word "moral " to involve the cherishing of good purposes and carrying them out by the use of means, it seems clear that morality cannot be attributed to the infinite God. It is important to see the reason for this. As I apprehend it, the difficulty does not lie in reconciling purpose but in reconciling the use of means to an infinite being. The incompatibility of infinite power with contrivance or the utilization of means for the achievement of purpose was pointed out long ago by John Stuart Mill. "The necessity for contrivance" as he reminds us, "the need of employment of means, is a consequence of the</page><page sequence="16">168 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW limitation of power. Who would have recourse to means if to attain his end his mere word was sufficient? The very idea of means implies that the means have an efficacy which the direct action of the being who employs them has not." 1 But while this is true, there is nothing, so far as I see, in the notion of purpose which is incompatible with the infinite God. Only the purpose must be achievable and achieved by Him directly and exactly when and how He wills it. It is the need of striving and struggling, the postponement of fruition, which cannot be rec- onciled with the Infinite One, not the possession of a purpose which He perpetually achieves. Such a view, of course, involves the further conception that God does not aim at some far-off divine event, but, instead, wills the total course of the actual cosmic process. His activity would thus not be work which must be accomplished before a goal can be reached, but might better be pictured as Hinduism pictures it, as the eternal play of the Divine. But we shall fail to grasp the real meaning of this Indian view if we take the word "play" to mean childish and purposeless activity. The play of the Indian Absolute is rather the strenuous and joyful activity of the inspired artist, ever achieving the production of supreme Beauty, in which end and means are one. The upholder of this view of the Divine will of course take a different attitude toward the problem of evil than that taken by many of those who advocate the doctrine of the finite God. The Infinite, whose play the cosmic process is, approves and wills all that happens including what we call evil as well as what we call good. Of course it is not the particular and isolated evil - or the isolated good - that He wills, but the total play or proc- ess; and it may be possible to show that what we call evil when taken in conjunction with what we know as good, in all its tem- poral and other relations, forms a necessary part of a perfect Whole, an unreplaceable aspect of the infinitely Beautiful. But can it be said that an Infinite Being, who wills actually all that happens, can be good in the sense of an ethics based on value? The Brahma of the Vedanta is said to be Sat, Chit, Ananda - Being, Mind, Joy. But the Infinite could be all of 1 Three Essays on Religion, pp. 177.</page><page sequence="17">GOD AND THE MORAL LAW 169 these and not be good in any moral sense. In fact the Brahma of Sankara's Advaita would seem to be decidedly "jenseits von Gut und B ise." Must the infinite God necessarily be so conceived? I think our answer to this will depend on what answer we succeed in making to the question whether to Being, Mind, and Joy we can add the character of Love. Can the infinite God love us? Spinoza's God, as we know, cannot. "He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return." For "if a man were to strive after this, he would desire that God, whom he loves, should not be God." 1 Spinoza here seems to me un- justifiably dogmatic. Certainly an Infinite Being (in the sense I have given to the word) need not love; but I see no reason why love should be to Him impossible. It is of course understood that love must have an object. But an Infinite Being might perfectly well find objects for His love in those finite minds who, indeed, live and move and have their being in Him, and yet retain enough of individuality (since it is His will that they should) to say "I am I," to choose and will, and to love in re- turn. Such finite persons the Infinite Being might conceivably love as, in a sense, parts of Himself, as branches of the Vine, sharing their life with Him yet partially individuated. Loving His finite creatures in this sense, the infinite God would will their moral development. Just how, if at all, this conception of God could be made to square with the facts of human life it is not the function of this paper to investigate. To this extent but only to this extent, as I understand it, could the infinite God be called morally good. And I must at once confess it is probable that the man in whom the moral aspect of the religious consciousness is dominant will feel as pro- foundly dissatisfied with this conception of the Divine as we found the mystic and his fellows were dissatisfied with the finite God. The moralist, as we may call him, will insist upon both a greater independence for man and a more partisan, active, and moralistic attitude in God than the view I have suggested will permit. The God whom the moral consciousness desires is usually a God who takes sides, who struggles against evil, who loves ideals similar to or identical with those that the 1 Ethics, Part V, Prop.

The strenuously moral and pluralistic universe which James pictures for us appeals to the heroic in all our hearts - a world insecure, uncertain, where real losses as well as real gains are possible, a world whose great- est power is a "God down in the dirt" struggling against odds, a world in which "the faithfulness of individuals here below to their own poor over-beliefs may actually help God in turn to be more effectively faithful to his own greater tasks." The conclusion to which I seem to have been driven is essen- tially the same as that put forward by Bradley in his essay on God and the Absolute. We seem to be faced by an ultimate crux within the religious consciousness. What we have called the moral and the mystical urges of our nature appear to de- mand incompatible conclusions. It would seem that we must deny one or the other; yet we cannot give up either without starving a part of our very selves. What can be done about this serious situation? It is not a situation that should be neglected. I do not think we can find a permanently satisfactory solution by taking the side of the finite or the side of the infinite God and denying altogether the claims of the discarded doctrine. Possibly some large and har- monizing concept, some Hegelian synthesis, may be discovered which will enable us to hold on to all that is of religious value in both positions. But this is a question for theology. And I am no theologian. Such a problem as this it is not for a mere philoso- pher to solve. My task consists merely in attempting to pre- sent, in as sharp outlines as I may, the problem; and having done this, I hand it over to you with my blessing and my best wishes. I am not hopeless that you, and the other theologians of our age, may be able to suggest a solution. Until you do I am content to wait with patience, cultivating in my heart a reverent agnosticism.</page></plain_text>
