<plain_text><page sequence="1">Principium Sapientiae. The Origins of Greek Philosophical Thought. By F. M. CORN- FORD. Edited by W. K. C. GUTHRIE. (Cambridge University Press. 1952. Pp. viii + 271. Price 25s). Some of the main themes of this book, on which Cornford was still working at his death, are already familiar from his earlier writings; but here they receive a new and fuller treatment, and extensive use is made of recent discoveries in anthropology, Oriental studies and other non-classical fields. The work is sub-titled 'A Study of the Origins of Greek Philosophical Thought ', and falls into two main parts. The first seeks to bring to light the prejudices and presuppositions of Greek philosophers, and to elucidate the relation between the philosopher and his predecessor the seer-poet. The second tracks down the origins of philosophical cosmogony in early myth and ritual. Modern enthusiasts have often exaggerated the genuinely scientific and empirical attitude of Greek natural philosophers. Cornford begins this book by a study of Epi- curus, showing how even he, a materialist and ostensibly a devotee of the senses, has</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 379 little interest in the patient methods of observation, hypothesis and the like; but is dogmatic and ' intuitive ' in all his fundamental doctrines. By a metaphor (' the reach- ing out of the mind') he concealed their non-empirical basis. His real notion of how knowledge is gained he shared with all the other philosophers. It was in medicine that an empirical theory of knowledge was practised as well as preached; and Hippocratic writings bear witness to the antagonism between the best methods of practising physi- cians and the typical procedures of natural philosophers. By the non-empirical conception of how knowledge is acquired Epicurus was ir- resistibly dominated. In Plato's theory of Anamnesis this conception is explicitly stated and argued for. It involves a view of the soul as capable, apart from the body, of seeing eternal truth; like the seer and poet, the wise man is possessed by divine inspiration. This view about knowledge is much older than the medical-empirical view. The three types which Democritus and Plato bring together-the prophet, the poet and the sage-were originally united in a single figure. And here, Cornford claims, 'we shall find the ultimate reason why the philosophers of the historic period deliver their oracles as men having an authority transcending common experience '. The composite figure of the shaman is the background to Homer and Hesiod. And while many sorts of extant literature contain other elements, cosmogony and theogony in particular enshrine myths of great antiquity, whose origin is unremembered by the poet who transmits them. Later thinkers criticised them or interpreted them allegori- cally. There was the clash between philosopher and seer, mainly over the purely physical explanation of phenomena which had been regarded as divine signs, and that between the philosopher and poet over the anthropomorphism of the myths. But the critics and philosophers, for all their originality, were not free from the profound influence of the past. Some indeed were, at least in certain respects, conscious inheritors of this past; thus ' Plato the philosopher resumes the role of prophet and poet which Socrates had disclaimed '. In the second half of the book Cornford makes a new start with a reconstruction of the philosophy of Anaximander, and argues that 'the pattern of Ionian cosmogony, for all its appearance of complete rationalism, is not a free construction of the intellect reasoning from direct observation of the existing world '. Exploration of the background of this pattern takes us far back. The Creation myth to be found in Hesiod's Hymn to Zeus is sufficiently like that in the Babylonian Hymn to Marduk to suggest that it is ultimately derived from it. Other parallels can be found. And behind the cosmo- gonical myth lies the New Year ritual; for the anthropomorphic story is a detachment fiom the ritual functions originally performed by the divine man, the King. These functions served to renew powers both in nature and in society, and what the King did symbolised universal events, not tied to particular persons or times. From them later came the material for an aetiological myth of what happened at the beginning. The myth then received elaboration, and gods with personal names were endowed with more and more biographical details ; until finally the myth itself provoked sceptical criticism. But the problems that presented themselves to early philosophers were determined by the myth and the even earlier ritual: problems about how order was instituted in the world and among men, and about weather, the seasons and fertility. And, in the last analysis, to quote from notes of Cornford drawn together by Professor Guthrie in an Appendix, 'the abandonment of personal accretions which is the aim of this early philosophical speculation entails a kind of rediscovery of the impersonal universal functions and factors which were originally involved in the renewal- (' crea- tion '-) drama and now appear once again stripped of their picturesque anthropomorphic dress '. This brief account of a book which is discursive (though not careless) in form can do no more than indicate its general lines. It is rich in discussions and interpretations of individual early Greek philosophers and of Plato as well as in analyses of philosophical concepts. And the bold scope of the subject makes it an exciting book to read. J. L. ACKRILL</page></plain_text>
