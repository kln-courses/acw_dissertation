<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME POPULAR MISCONCEPTIONS CONCERNING GER MAN ROMANTICISM I In the dedicatory epistle to Urne-Buriall, Sir Thomas Browne said in 1658: "The field of knowledge hath been so traced, it is hard to spring anything new." And in the body of the book he said in the same connection: "'Tis too late to be ambitious." In view of the encyclopaedic mass of material that has been written on German Romanticism, it would seem that everything concern ing it has been said; that it is too late to be ambitious; or that there remain only time and place for the application of that not wholly enviable sort of ambition which exhausts itself in the attempted refutation of canonized opinions. There are two types of refutations: complete and partial. The theme of this paper was not suggested by a vaulting ambition to make a complete denial of any one broad generality that has been posited concerning German Romanticism. Such an undertaking would result in nothing more than an exchange of dogmas. It is an attempt to point out the partial and occasional untenability of a number of comprehensive beliefs that have long obtained in the realm of Romantic investigation. It is an attempt to profit by the remark of one of the Church Fathers1 who said: Primus sapientiae gradus est, falsa intelligere. The task is comparatively easy, for (what should be obvious even to the meanest capacity) though correctly formulated generalities2 must hold in so exact a science as pure mathematics, they cannot hold in so inexact a science as literary criticism. A suggestion as to the origin of the misleading because overdrawn statements that have been made concerning German Romanticism can be derived from this situation. At the close of his monograph on Novalis, Georg Gloege says :3 " Er war der typische Repr?sentant des romantischen Charakters. Das Typische ist hier schwer nach zuweisen, weil die Eigent?mlichkeit dieses Geistestypus eben die 1 In the Institutiones Divinae of Lactantius Firmianus. 2Helmuth Mielke wisely says: "Summarische Urteile sind . . . eigentlich nichts als Henkerstricke der Kritik." See Der deutsche Roman, p. xiv. 3 Cf. Novalis's Heinrich von Ofterdingen als Ausdruck seiner Pers?nlichkeit. Leipzig, 1911, p. 186. Gloege's idea is taken entirely from Brandes's Die r. Schule in Deut., p. 12, edition of 1894.</page><page sequence="2">480 Porterfield ist, ohne feste typische Formen zu sein, ganz wie die Eigent?m lichkeit der Poesie, die er hervorbrachte." That is to say, Novalis was a typical Romanticist because he was atypical. Though slightly paradoxical, Gloege's observation is not pointless, for, taken as a whole, there is one tenable generality that can be made concerning the Romanticists that cannot be made concerning the members of any other literary movement: There is hardly anything that they were not. n (1) The inadequacy of the term Romanticism. Etymologically speaking, all German Romanticism should have some connection, direct or implied, either with Rome, or the Roman Empire, for in the root roma we find the embryo of " romanticism." The majority of German Romanticism has, however, no more to do with Rome or the Roman Empire than it has to do with any other city or country. From one point of view, this matters but little, for the precise meaning of a word can only rarely be determined by its history or its etymology. If it could, then every German novel, every deutscher Roman, would be a "romantic" affair. Or, witness the word religion, which, according to Cicero, comes from re+legere, that is, "to go through again because of reverent interest in the thing again gone through with." But Cicero was assassinated forty-three years before the Christian era, and he himself was a prominent member of that nation which was well-nigh devoid of spiritual and religious ideals. There is, nevertheless, another phase of the matter, which calls for discussion. Familiarity with the national and linguistic events that made roma reappear in Romanticism can be presupposed. But the misleading quality of the term becomes apparent so soon as we begin to study real Romanticism, for very little of it resembles those picaresque tales of chivalric adventure that found great favor with the Romance peoples on their becoming Romance peoples and on their acquiring Romance languages. Indeed it was just this sort of literature on which the orthodox Romanticists dropped the vitriol of contumely. And they had abundant occa sion so to do. Between the years 1790 and 1840, scores of non-romantic and now unread men and women wrote epic and dramatic works and</page><page sequence="3">Some Misconceptions Concerning German Romanticism 481 used the descriptive adjective "romantisch" in entitling them.4 Etymologically and substantially, the attribute seems to have been happily applied. The genuine Romanticists, however, rarely used the word in this way, though they did employ it in the body of their writings; but so did Lessing.5 Indeed, the one conspicuous instance was Schiller in his Jungfrau von Orleans, which he called "eine romantische Trag?die." But the Romanticists rarely did this,6 and to them Romanticism meant something very different from what it meant to their sentimental and therefore shallow contemporaries. Various charges can be preferred and sustained against the German Romanticists, but with the worst of intentions it cannot be said that they were predominantly sentimental and shallow. As a type of this sort of Romanticism we might take Tromlitz's "Der alte Troubadour,"7 the subtitle of which is "eine romantische Erz?hlung." In it we are told at great length of the feud between the D'Esperrons and the D'Ajouts, how the daughter of the latter is reared, unaware of her parentage, by Pierre Jacquelin, the old troubadour, the friend of the D'Ajouts, and how she is eventually married to Robert D;Esperron, thus effecting a partial reconcilia tion between the two families, but only after feuds have been fought, lives lost, castles destroyed, and all sorts of incognitos cleared up. 4 Some of the titles of the time were: Romantische Erz?hlungen, by A. W. Schreiber (1795); Rinaldo, Rinaldini, eine romantische Geschichte, by C. A. Vulpius (1798); Das stille Thal. Ein romantisches Gem?hide, by A. von Trom litz 1799); Die Mexicanerin. Historisch-romantisches Heldengedicht in sechs Ges?ngen, by Caroline Lessing (1829). In 1798, Frau von Wallenrodt pub lished at Rostock a collection entitled "Erz?hlungen und dramatisch bear beitete Scenen zur Unterhaltung f?r Freunde romantischer Leet?re." 5 In Hamb. Dram. 86. St?ck, p. 263 in volume II of the first edition. 8 Concerning this use of the adjective "romantisch" W. Schlegel said in the last of his Vorlesungen ?ber dramatische Kunst und Literatur: "Was die Menge in unsern halb r?hrenden, halb drolligen Dramen am meisten anzieht, die uns bald nach Peru, bald nach Kamtschatka, bald in die Ritterzeit versetzen, w?hrend die Gesinnungen modern und empfindsam bleiben, ist immer eine Fratze des Romantischen. . . . Auf hundert Kom?dienzetteln wird der Name Romantisch an rohe und verfehlte Erzeugnisse verschwendet und entweiht; es sei uns erlaubt, ihn durch Kritik und Geschichte wieder zu seiner wahren Bedeutung zu adein." See S?mmtliche Werke, Vol. VI, pp. 432-433. 7 In Tromlitz's S?mmtliche Schriften, Vol. VTI, pp. 1-73.</page><page sequence="4">482 Porterfield As to content, the story resembles Romeo and Juliet and Grill parzer's Das Kloster bei Sendomir; as to mood, it appeals somewhat as do the works of Fouqu?. It is highly imaginary, but not imaginative,?* a common failing, it seems, with this sort of litera ture and with some real Romanticism. Bad Romanticism is imaginary, good Romanticism is imaginative. Graf von Loeben is a type par excellence of the Romanticist who wrote imaginary literature. One of the most imaginative poems in German lit erature is Annette von Droste's "Das ?de Haus." Tromlitz's story is romance, but not Romantic in the best German historical sense. It is such a romance as Cervantes5 would have burned in his Don Quixotic holocaust. This inadequacy of the term Romanticism is unfortunate, for the Rationalist and the Realist are happily so called, but the trouble is we have these three types of literature. We have, to be sure, but two types of mind and it makes but little difference whether we classify these as "naive" and "sentimental," or "classic" and "romantic," or "judicial" and "impressionistic," or "intellectual" and "intuitionistic," or "logical" and "emotional." This does not go far enough, for the poet can deal with the ideal or the real, and we do not automatically know beforehand what the one writer is going to do with his lorie and the other with his emotion. The logician may be either a rationalist or a realist; he may treat either the ideal or the real. But he cannot be a romanticist. The emotionalist may be either a realist or a romanticist; he too may treat either the ideal or the real. But he cannot be a ration alist.10 This whole matter could be visualized if we could set a Lessing, a Novalis, and an Anzengruber to work on the same theme, on, 8 See John Dewey's How We Think, p. 224. 9 The reference is to the sixth chapter of Don Quijote, in which the Parson and the Barber pass final judgment on the Squire's library. 10 In view of the ever recurring tendency among the Germans to become radical purists, it is peculiar that just in literary terminology such words as "Rationalist," "Realist," and "Romanticist" should have become so firmly rooted. And it is especially odd that the very movement which did so much by way of reviving the past of the nation should be known by a foreign name. " Germanicismus" would be more appropriate than " Romanticismus." Or, to become ultra-radical, "Jenatik" would be more appropriate than "Roman tik." And then, were the movement given a Germanic name, the cosmopolitan feature of it would suffer.</page><page sequence="5">Some Misconceptions Concerning German Romanticism 483 say, Schiller's "Ernst ist das Leben und heiter ist die Kunst," and let each one of them treat the sobriety of life and gaiety of art as the two appealed to him and without knowing that the others were treating the same subject. Then we would see from the writings of these three that Romanticism lags behind the other terms in fitness and propriety and that it is only a tag, the superscription of which would generally send the contents to the wrong destination. (2) Definitions of Romanticism. It is a tale-telling fact that where one man has attempted to define Rationalism or Realism, ten at least have attempted to render the same service to Roman ticism. This is owing to the unusualness of the latter; we demand a definition of that which looks odd or acts oddly.n And so many poets and scholars have defined Romanticism that those of us who are not poets at all and scholars only in part have come to believe that it can be defined. To take an easy illustration, longing for the infinite became the shibboleth of the German Romanticists. In other words, they were dissatisfied with what they had and, instead of whining about their actual indigence (Realism), or turn ing their cautious intellects loose on what might be termed the "cash register" problems of abstract thinking (Rationalism), they longed for the things they did not have, and being possessed of a strong imagination they made short work of it by longing for the infinite. But if Romanticism be a longing for the infinite, then a definition of it is a contradiction in terms. And something like this is always the trouble. ' Each definer has so framed his defini tion as to indicate beforehand his own peculiar beliefs, and some times to beg the question in their favor. Some use a term that connotes so little that it admits of only individual application; others use a term that connotes so much that it itself stands in need of a definition; still others confuse historical Romanticism and lay romanticism. These are the worst offenders owing to the mutability of taste. Novalis said12 once concerning life as a whole: 11 In his Beitr?ge zu einer Kritik der Sprache, Vol. Ill, pp. 295-296, Fritz Mauthner says: "Millionen von Menschen essen K?se und sprechen von K?se, ohne einer Definition des Begriffs "K?se" zu bed?rfen. Erst wenn ich in S?dfrankreich einen fl?ssigen Rahm als K?se vorgesetzt bekomme, werde ich stutzig, komme zum Bewusstsein meiner mangelhaften Bildung und frage nach der Wortdefinition." 12 Cf. Vol. I, 2, p. 5.</page><page sequence="6">484 Porter?eld "Wer sucht, wird zweifeln." In this connection we might extend his gloomy apothegm and say: "Wer untersucht, wird verzwei feln." But previous definers have not despaired; they have only for gotten. They have forgotten that the very nature of the defini tion has changed with time; there was first the Aristotelian, then the Kantian, now the Modern, of which, according to the Century Dictionary, there are eighteen distinct types. This complicates the matter. They have forgotten, too, that of the fifty main Romanticists, no two wrote the same sort of poetry. Also, fifty critics means different critics, for, since the days of Leibniz,13 who introduced the idea of "Gesichtspunkt" into German thought, each critic must have his own point of view. Also, both the poet and the critic change from time to time, so that the whole matter is a case of eighteen by fifty by fifty by fifty by fifty and so on up to infinity. In short, students of Romanticism can never hope for anything but multifarious classes of definitions of it. All definitions of German Romanticism can, however, be divi ded into three main classes. First, those definitions in which the verb predominates. We are told that the Romanticists tried to do certain things. Such definitions have but little value; they resolve themselves into mere descriptions and criticisms. Then there are those in which the adjective looms large. Romanticism has been defined as being "aesthetic," "bizarre," "Catholic," "dynamic," "emotional," "faulty," "Gothic," "hedonic," "im aginative," "Jacobin," "un-Kantian," "libidinous," "Mediaeval," "national," "occult," "progressive," "Quixotic," "reactionary," "subjective," "Teutonic," "universal," "vague," "witch-ridden," "exotic," "youthful" and "zealous." And finally, there are those definitions according to which Romanticism is a number of things, those in which the noun plays the most important r?le. Tautology and synonyms bulk so big in these that, with one exception, they may be passed over in respectful silence. In this connection, we may point out that, etymologically and historically speaking, the situation is somewhat as it is with Nietzsche's superman. Nietzsche derived, it seems, the latterly uncommon substantive "?bermensch" from the common adjec 13 Cf. Fritz Mauthner's Beitr?ge, Vol. ILE, p. 300.</page><page sequence="7">Some Misconceptions Concerning German Romanticism 485 tive "?bermenschlich" and not the other way around.14 Just so with Romanticism: the Beiwort came first, and then the Haupt wort. The adjective15 was introduced into England in 1659, into Germany in. 1698 ; that is to say, poets in England and Germany were describing a scene from life or nature, they were defining a concept, an idea, an aper?u, a state of mind before they had any distinctive and definite term for it. Is it any wonder then that Die Romantik has been so bandied about by lexicographers and the users thereof? The situation then is similar to that in Nietzsche and yet quite different. "Mensch" is not simply generic; it is all-inclusive. I can say that Nietzsche's "?bermensch" is "ein ?bermenschlicher Mensch," differing from his colleagues to such a degree, quanti tatively and therefore qualitatively, that I define him by prefixing a preposition with ascending connotation to his original and less pretentious name, by giving the preposition adjectival force, and by allowing the resultant compound to stand for my new, my millenial anthropomorphic species who differs from others that nevertheless belong in the same class. The logic of this nonsensical verbiage is unassailable, for Nietzsche's "?bermensch" remains a "Mensch," otherwise he could not be an "?ber-Mensch" But with "Romantik" it is different; here it is a matter of quality only,?in so far as quantity and quality can be dissociated, in so far as one does not depend upon the other. Had the Roman ticists described the things which they were pleased to call "ro mantisch" as being "?berliterarisch," then it is entirely possible that we would never have heard of the term "Romantik" but of "?berliteratur." But they employed the adjective "romantisch" and the noun "Romantik." This is a partitive term, the "Mann" or the "Weib" of literature. It is a make-shift and frequently a make-believe. Not even with the linguistic aid of other lan guages can we derive16 it as satisfactorily as Nietzsche derived his famous substantive. And in either case, the child brought up 14 Cf. Neitzsche. Sein Leben und seine Werke. By Richard M. Meyer, p. 452. Meyer calls such formations "R?cklaufsworte." 15 Cf. The New English Dictionary and Grimms Deutsches W?rterbuch. 18 In his Deutsche Literaturgeschichte, Alfred Biese says (Vol. II, p. 342) : "Aus dem Wilhelm Meister stammte auch ihr Name." The reference is to Romanticism. But this cannot be correct; the word both as noun and adjec tive was more or less common before 1796. And Goethe uses the adjective only twice, and then in both instances in a most neutral sense. See pages 189 and 395 of the edition of Erich Schmidt.</page><page sequence="8">486 Porterfield the father, unless we are to conclude that nouns generally spring from adjectives and not the reverse. As to the one exception in the list of nouns that define Roman ticism, symbolism is really felicitous. Romanticism is symbolism. The Romanticist uses figures of speech. His words cannot be taken at their face value; they have a symbolic meaning. All words are, of course, nothing but symbols, but with the Romanticist the symbolism is once removed. Brentano said:17 "Das Roman tische selbst ist eine ?bersetzung." Heine said: "Du bist wie eine Blume." The simile makes the poem Romantic, even more so than it would have been had Heine said: "Du bist gar eine Blume," for in Heine's verse we have the dualistic picture of the girl and the flower, whereas the metaphor would have reduced the girl-idea to a rriinimum. Or Heine could have become a Realist; he could have deprived his poem of about one half of its worth by saying: "Du bist ein liebes M?dchen," etc. The crown in Arnim's "Die Kronenw?chter" is only a symbol, a haloed hoop around which Amim's ideas most loosely revolve. The blue flower in Novalis's "Ofterdingen" is the symbol of happiness as embodied in poetry, and this same poetry has also a symbolic meaning.18 But to say that Romanticism is symbolism19 is to swap symbols and do nothing more. This is a common characteristic of defini tions of it. And when they do not move in a circle they fly off at a tangent. Schiller's division of literature into "naiv" and "senti mentalisch" is an affront to the Kinder- und Hausm?rchen and Des Knaben Wunderhorn, two of the chief philological accomplish ments of the younger Romanticists, and to many of their most naive and spontaneous lyrics. Schiller was, to be sure, very careful to state that we can find naive poets among the moderns just as we 17 Cf. Godwi, p. 304, edition of Ansei m Ruest. 18 Novalis had symbolism in mind when he wrote: "Jedes Wort hat seine eigenth?mliche Bedeutung, seine Nebenbedeutung, seine falschen und durchaus willk?hruchen Bedeutungen." Cf. Vol. II, 1, p. 324. Almost every word in Julia Ward Howe's Battle Hymn of the Republic is used symbolically. 19 For a detailed discussion of symbolism, see Hegel's Aesthetik. But after reading Hegel one asks the question: Is there any sort of art or literature that is not symbolism ?</page><page sequence="9">Some Misconceptions Concerning German Romanticism 487 find sentimental poets among the ancients, but interpreters20 of Schiller have not always been as careful as he himself was. Goethe said:21 "Das Classische nenne ich das Gesunde, und das Romantische das Kranke. Und da sind die Nibelungen clas sisch wie der Homer, denn beide sind gesund und t?chtig." In other words, Goethe found the Nibelungenlied with all its "Weinen und Klagen," with all its descriptions of fighting and drinking, its protracted account of spite, jealousy, and revenge, its murders open and back-handed, healthy. And since he said without reserve that the ancient is "stark, frisch, froh, und gesund," he found a Euripidean tragedy with its nerve-torturing fanaticism, its repulsive ethical system of blood-guilt, healthy. And since he said that "Das Meiste" of the modern is "schwach, kr?nklich, und krank," he found the majority of the wholesome fairy-tales, novelettes, and lyrics of the Romanticists unhealthy. No, Goethe did not quite mean this; yet he said so either in so many words or by implication. The trouble is, as an old and wise man he committed himself dogmatically on a matter that is pretty largely a personal affair and one that has to be re-settled by the individuals of succeeding generations. There is about as much truth in his observation as there is in Wilhelm Schlegel's along the same fine. Schlegel said:22 "Warum f?hlen wir die roman tische Poesie inniger und geheimnissvoller als die klassische? Weil die Griechen nur die Poetik der Freude ersonnen hatten. Der Schmerz ist aber poetischer als das Vergn?gen, und der Ernst als der Leichtsinn." Such a remark raises at once a number of ques tions that will not down: Do we feel Romantic poetry "inniger" and "geheimnissvoller" than Classical poetry? If we do, is it because the Greeks thought out only the poetics of joy? Did the Greeks do this? According to Nietzsche they did, but Nietzsche had a peculiar conception of joy. As to the statement that grief 20 As we might expect, Karl Berger interprets Schiller's classification with due allowance for exceptions; but Berger's book is for the few. H. W. Nevin son's is for the many and hurried, and from it we would conclude that Schiller meant by "naiv" and "sentimentalisch" only "classic" and "romantic" and even the Schlegels translated Schiller's "naiv" and "sentimentalisch" into "classisch" and "romantisch" respectively. See Eckermanns Gespr?che mit Goethe, March 21, 1830. 21 Cf. Eckermanns Gespr?che, April 2, 1829. 22 Cf. S?mmtliche Werke, Bd. VIH, p. 144.</page><page sequence="10">488 Porterfield and seriousness are more poetic than pleasure and flippancy, no one can raise any doubt. (3) German Romanticism and the Middle Ages. The tersest statement concerning the Middle Ages is that the Rationalists con demned them, Herder explained them, Tieck and Wackenroder adored them.23 Truth is here a cohabitant of untruth. In so far as the Rationalists condemned them, their condemnation was based somewhat on a lack of information, for there was no eighteenth century Rationalist who thoroughly understood the Middle Ages. ' The term itself did not become current until about 1790. Lessing,24 a Rationalist par excellence had great interest in them and respect for them. Herder was a superb beginner and a poor finisher. If our knowledge of the Middle Ages had to depend upon his brief explanation they would still be unexplained to a very large degree.25 Tieck and Wackenroder did to be sure adore the so-called Middle Ages as they understood them, just as they adored many other things, some of which they understood better. Then there is Heine. In 1832 he said: " Die Romantische Schule in Deutschland war nichts anders als die Wiedererweckung der Poesie des Mittelalters." Forgetting now that Romanticism was then only in the making, that nothing of value had then been written on it, that Heine was at that time an errant journalist, that suggestiveness and unreliability were dancing partners in his book, that he himself was honestly interested in Mediaeval legends, ?forgetting aU this, students of Romanticism are all too prone to 23 Cf. Ludwig Tiecks Genoveva als romantische Dichtung betrachtet. By Johann Ranftl, Graz, 1899, pp. 6-7: "Verdammung und Verachtung des Mittel alters beim Aufkl?rer, Erkl?rung des historisch Gewordenen und Gewachsenen bei Herder, Bewunderung, Verehrung und Anbetung bei den Romantikern Tieck und Wackenroder." 24 We should remember, in this connection, that Lessing wrote the following works: "?ber das Heldenbuch," "Ein alter Meistergesang," "?ber die soge nannten Fabeln aus den Zeiten der Minnesinger," "Von den Minnesingern bis auf Luthern." 25 According to Rudolf Haym's monumental life of Herder, the only comment made by Herder on the Middle Ages was his sketch in Auch eine Philosophie der Geschichte zur Bildung der Menschheit (1774), and in Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit (1784). In the former Herder defended the Middle Ages against the attacks of such Rationalists as Voltaire, Hume, Robertson and Iselin. In the latter he attacked the Middle Ages because of their lack of "Licht" and "Humanit?t" as was made manifest by the "tolle Kreuzz?ge."</page><page sequence="11">Some Misconceptions Concerning German Romanticism 489 adopt Heine's statement as a convenient point ?f departure. The whole matter, when stated with such absolute dogmatism, is a popular fallacy ? la Charles Lamb. On the ground that accuracy is only itself, it is not much more true than it would have been had Heine said: "Die Romantische Schule in Deutschland hatte gar nichts mit der Poesie des Mittelalters zu tun."26 Now literature is based on life, and there is no time to point out the various phases of Mediaeval life that ran directly counter to the Romanticists' spiritual attitude: Asceticism, monasticism, priestly celibacy, pietism, philosophy ancillary to theology, intel lectual and physical dependence, and tradition, to mention only a few that stand out.27 But Romanticism, since it became reac tionary only against any sort of narrowing reaction naturally abounded in contradictions. And there were some phases of the Middle Ages which made an honest appeal to the Romanticists: Intuition, mysticism, and so on. The old Romantic School in the sense that Rudolf Hay m used the term was founded in Berlin by Schleiermacher the preacher, Tieck the poet, and Fr. Schlegel the philosopher and doctrinaire. In its original inception, this Romantic School was pretty largely a spiritual affair; it concerned the soul, and Schleiermacher was the High Priest of the Romantic soul. He fought at all times against unadulterated intellectualism, rationalism, and formalism in reli gion. What was his attitude toward Mediaevalism? He can be dismissed with the tenable generality that his interest in, knowledge of, and relation to the Middle Ages were not simply tenuous; they were non-existent.28 The spirit of the Mediaeval Church 28 Professor Henry A. Beers, for example, gives Heine entirely too much credit in his two books on English Romanticism in the 18th and 19th centuries. 27 The modern student can possibly derive the best picture of the Middle Ages from Henry Osborn Taylor's The Mediaeval Mind, 2 volumes, 1911. 28 The best place to get a correct picture of Schleiermacher is in Haym's Romantische Schule, Walzel edition, 1914, pp. 447-611. To a certain degree, Haym followed Wilhelm D?they's Leben Schleiermachers, Berlin, 1870. D? they's biography covers Schleiermacher's life only to 1802. The work was never finished. Neither Haym nor D?they discusses Schleiermacher and the Middle Ages. There is no positive evidence that Heine knew anything at all about Schleiermacher in 1832. Nor does Heine mention Schleiermacher in his Zur Geschiciite der Religion und Philosophie in Deutschland (1S35), though he men tions many other theologians of but small repute.</page><page sequence="12">490 Porterfield found very small favor with him, he never accepted the Tieck Wackenroder theory as to the relation of art to religion. He was exceedingly modern in his whole attitude toward soul-culture, and when he was not modern he was ancient, he was Platonic. In short, he was never even mildly Mediaeval, though he founded the Romantic School, and Protestant theology today rests to a large degree on his shoulders. The works written by Tieck during his period of Rationalism (1790-1798) have only neglible bearing on anything Mediaeval; those written during the first six years of his period of Romanticism (1798-1804) concern themselves largely with the Middle Ages; those written during the last sixteen years of his period of Roman ticism (1804-1820) much less; those written during his period of incipient Realism (1820-53) still less. Fr. Schlegel began his career by making a careful study of Lessing and the Greeks. Later in life he became famous as a lecturer on Sanscrit, Classical Antiquity, the philosophy of life and history and language. He deduced his theory of the Romantic School in part from Goethe's "Wilhelm Meister." As a creative writer, he is known as the author of the notorious novel "Lucinde," and his unique drama " Alarkos." All of which is certainly not Mediaeval. The collection of "Romantische Sagen und Dichtungen des Mit telalters" published under his name and in his works was done by his wife Dorothea. This does not, of course, interfere with Heine's contention, though it does acquit Fr. Schlegel. We cannot, how ever, acquit him entirely; his writings on "Christliche Kunst," his lectures on "Alte und Neue Literatur," and some of his enthu siastic though not inspired poems betray a most decided Mediaeval leaning. The great bulk of his work, however, was devoted to ancient or modern times. In so far as he is known today, he is not known for his studies in Mediaevalism. The case of Wilhelm Schlegel is somewhat similar. Epics he did not write. He wrote a goodly number of poems, some of which are on Mediaeval poets, others of which are Mediaeval in senti ment. His unique drama, "Ion," is rigidly classic in form and substance. Aside from his numerous criticisms, he-is best known for his lectures on dramatic art and literature, wherein the late Romance Mediaeval dramatists are discussed. He and his brother edited Das Athen?um, the official organ of the Romantic</page><page sequence="13">Some Misconceptions Concerning German Romanticism 491 School, which, beginning in 1798 was discontinued in 1800. Aside from a translation of the eleventh canto of the " Rasender Roland," by Wilhelm Schlegel, it concerned itself not in the least with Medi aevalism. Indeed, in so far as the Romantische Schule was a revivification of the poetry of the Middle Ages, Das Athen?um represented it about as loyally as Euphorion represents the Baptist Church. But Trost-Einsamkeit, the official organ of the younger Romantic School fulfils every requirement of Heine's contention. Its subtitle was "Alte und neue Sagen und Wahrsagungen, Ge schichten und Gedichte," and it did what it advertised. It is entirely Mediaeval either in content or tone or both. Wackenroder, with Tieck's cooperation, glorified at first the days of D?rer (1471-1528), and then Tieck alone pushed the glorification back much further. Brentano's "Chronika eines fahrenden Sch?lers" is laid in the fourteenth century, and Novalis's "Ofter dingen" goes back to the thirteenth. But Novalis gives us only a dim picture of his historically unauthenticated hero, while his symbolic Poesieroman as a whole looks forward to a Golden Age, to an age that is to come, and that has not even now arrived. And so, with some brilliant exceptions, the interest of the Ro manticists in the Middle Ages was by no means persistent and consequential, certainly not sufficiently so as to justify Heine's "nichtanders" statement. Eichendorff, for example, had nothing to do with the Middle Ages. And a number of the poets whom Heine treats under the general rubric Romantische Schule were as innocent of the Middle Ages as they were of this very present. Also, the poets frequently used a Mediaeval story simply as a peg on which to hang a modern idea. Immermann, for example, tells29 us that he had no intention of reviving the memory of Gottfried von Strassburg when he wrote his "Tristan und Isolde," but that he wished to write such a romance as he believed Gottfried would write were he still on earth. The truth of the matter is that during the period of Romantic letters there were a number of distinguished scholars30 actively engaged in exhuming, if not resurrecting, the Middle Ages.

But these were not men of letters, and because they revived the Middle Ages from the point of view of the historical philologist we cannot say that German Romanticism was a revivi fication of the poetry of the Middle Ages, and then stop. Here, as always in literary criticism, dogmatism must be made to meet skepticism face to face. Romanticism suffered an almost irreparable blow in 1815 with the battle of Waterloo. All of a sudden the Romanticists, poets and politicians, acquired that for which they had longed and their possessions inflicted responsibilities which they could not gracefully meet. It looked for twenty-five years as though Romanticism were over. And during this period " the barbarism of the Middle Ages" became a stock phrase. But in 1840, Friedrich Wilhelm 3V, "Der Romantiker auf dem Throne der Caesaren,"31 ascended the throne of Prussia and Romanticism took on a new lease of life. It is unnecessary to analyze the Romantic elements in his character or to show how he tried, possibly through the influence of Bettine,32 to revive Romanticism by reinstating as it were the Romanticists. The favors he conferred on Alexander von Humboldt, Savigny, Schelling, the Grimm brothers, Cornelius, R?ckert, Uhland, Freiligrath, Geibel, Arndt, Felix Mendelssohn, and Tieck are isolated instances. But these Romanticists certainly did not con cern themselves to any marked degree with the poetry of the Middle Ages, though historians cannot afford to overlook the part they played in the general Romantic movement. And at least one historian of the time, Heinrich von Sybel, flagellated the Romanticists' overestimation of the Middle Ages in his Ge schichte des ersten Kreuzzugs (1841).33 31 It was D. Fr. Strauss in his Julian der Abtr?nnige who indirectly gave Fr. W?hlern IV this soubriquet. 32 Cf. Das Haus der Brentano, by Wolfgang M?ller von K?nigswinter, edition of 1913, pp. 369 ff 33 Aside from all this, it is so easy to be deceived as to "Mediaeval" char acters in literature. Julian Schmidt, for example, pointed out the fact that the people of Sternbald, though they wear drapings that are more or less Medi aeval, really come from Goethe's Wilhelm Meister. See Vol. I, p. 382 of the 4th edition of Schmidt's Geschichte.</page><page sequence="15">Some Misconceptions Concerning German Romanticism 493 Finally, let us not forget that modern scholarship has proved the unity of history34 and the consequent continuity of literature. The spiritual drama may at times lag, but it is unbroken and coherent. The term "Middle Ages" was at first only a matter of grammatical and philological nomenclature used to designate the linguistic parenthesis between the Latin language that was going and the Romance languages that were coming.35 Christopher Keller36 first used the term, in Germany, in 1688. According to Grimm's W?rterbuch, even Wieland spoke consistently of "Die Mittleren Zeiten," while Goethe used both "Mittlere Zeiten" and "Mittelalter." Then the term was unhappily adopted by histor ians who had not yet learned their craft. But time fails to do anything more than to emphasize the fact that "Das Mittelalter" was about as vague a term as ever found favor with the German Romantic poets in general;37 of its scientific significance in par ticular, Heine was laughably unaware, while his knowledge of the poetry of the Middle Ages was, at most, second hand. And since he wrote his book on Romanticism in 1832, to lose all sense of chron ology and say now that he treated the Romantic movement is like saying that Julius Caesar landed in England in 55 B. C. Julius Caesar never saw England; he never even saw Britain. He landed in Britannia, and that is a quite different affair. (4) Romanticism and Philosophy. It is the current belief that German Romantic literature is so shot through with systematic philosophy that the most direct route to the former is through the 34 Cf. The Unity of History. By E. A. Freeman, London, 1872. 35 Cf. Qu'est-ce que le moyen ?ge? By Godefroid Kurth, Bruxelles, 1898. Kurth shows that, properly speaking, there was no Mittelalter. He says concerning the adoption of the term that we must not ascribe all of the blame to the his torians: "Les vrais coupables, ce sont les p?dagogues." 30 Keller published a book at Jena entitled: Historia MediiAevi, a temporibus Constantini Magni ad Constantinopolim a Turcis captam deducta. 37 In 1833, Immermann said: "Ich glaube, dass es jetzt Niemand giebt, der sich mit Tieck in der Kenntnis des Mittelalters vergleichen kann." See Put litz's Immermann, Vol. II, p. 44. Immermann hereby betrayed his own lack of knowledge with the subject in question. It might be well to state in this connection that Wackenroder seems to have known Middle High German quite well. Tieck may have profited by his friend's wisdom.</page><page sequence="16">494 Porteriield gate-way of the latter.38 What are the facts? Did the Romantic poets read the Romantic philosophers? Jean Paul published his Clavis Fichetana at Erfurt in 1800, and H?lderlin was more or less familiar with the works of Plato, Spinoza, Kant, Fichte, and Schelling. But Jean Paul and H?lderlin are Romanticists only by chronology and courtesy. Tieck persiflated Fichte, derived a few suggestions from Steffens, and studied Schelling after a fashion.39 But on the whole Tieck was unmetaphysical and un ph?osophic. Wilhelm Schlegel knew Kant's Kritik der Urteils kraft though his knowledge is not betrayed in his works.40 Novalis was quite well versed in modern philosophy, and Fr. Schlegel even more so. Kleist made himself unhappy by studying Kant. These are the only significant instances that can be cited. Of the other Romanticists, R?ckert was for a short while Schell ing's colleague at Erlangen, though R?cken did not take kindly to speculative thought and metaphysical reasoning. Eichendorff heard Schleiermacher and Steffens at Halle and Fichte at Berlin. Fouqu? and Chamisso studied Jakob B?hme, Immermann wrote41 a small pamphlet on Fichte and Heine a popular treatise on religion and philosophy in Germany. Heine was honest enough to admit, however, that he knew very little about the subject?and his treatise shows it. Wackenroder, Arnim, E. T. A. Hoffmann, M?rike, Uhland, and Brentano never studied philosophy. To Brentano the subject was especially distasteful. How, then, could all of these poets have been influenced by the philosophy of their time? They could not have absorbed it as Socrates tried to do from Agathon (in Plato's Symposium) by mere association. It is, indeed, a popular misconception to believe that 38 Two works of importance bearing on this subject are W. Schmidt's Fichtes Einfluss auf die ?ltere Romantik in Euphorion, Band 20, Hefte 3-5. The outcome of the entire matter is, according to Schmidt, that Fichte did not influence the older Romanticists. And O. F. Walzel reaches the same con clusion as to Fichte and the other philosophers in his Deutsche Romantik, Bd. 232 of "Aus Natur und Geisteswelt." 39 Cf. Rudolf Hayms Romantische Schule, p. 693 of the Walzel edition. 40 Cf. Rudolf Hayms Romantische Schule, p. 178. 41 Cf. Immermanns Werke, Hempel edition, Vol. XVIII, pp. 168-193.</page><page sequence="17">Some Misconceptions Concerning German Romanticism 495 we can find parallel passages42 in the works of the Romantic poets and philosophers.43 This misconception can be so easily explained that it looks as though it were no misconception. The epoch of Romantic litera ture was coeval with the epoch of Romantic philosophy. Between the birth of Lessing (1729) and the death of Heine (1856) we have the parallel period of philosophy bounded by the birth of Kant (1724) and the death of Schopenhauer (1860). The poets and phil osophers all belonged to the same age, an age so illustrious that its equal has to be sought among the ancient Greeks. In some instances they were personal friends; but philosophy is not some thing to be socially absorbed. In so far as the works of Novalis are heavily tinged with philosophy, it is owing to the fact that he studied philosophy; and in the case of Fr. Schlegel it is owing not only to the fact that he studied philosophy but that he was a phil osopher. The discussion of such types cannot, therefore, lead to a definite solution of the problem; it can only raise a question that is as perplexing as it is general: can a poet be a philosopher? Fr. Schlegel and Novalis44 said he could; and they said so frequently 42 In Fichte's Grundlage der gesammien Wissenschaftslehre (1794), p. 222 of the original edition occur these words: "Reflektiert das Ich auf sich selbst, und bestimmt sich dadurch, so ist das Nicht-Ich unendlich und unbegr?nzt. Reflek tiert dagegen das Ich auf das Nicht-Ich ?berhaupt (auf das Universum) und bestimmt es dadurch, so ist es selbst unendlich. In der Vorstellung stehen demnach Ich und Nicht-Ich in Wechselwirkung; ist das eine endlich, so ist das andere unendlich; und umgekehrt; eins von beiden ist aber immer unendlich. ?(Hier liegt der Grund der von Kant aufgestellten Antinomien.)" This passage contains, in Fichtean terminology, a vast deal of Romantic philosophy; the same words occur many times also in Romantic literature. But it is impos sible to see how the poets' worship of the ego and the infinite could have been influenced to any marked degree by these two elusive and ubiquitous things. 43 In addition to the above instances, it seems that Platen had a superficial knowledge of Hegel. Of his Schatz des Rhampsinit (1824) Witkowski says: "Gegen die Hegeische Philosophie." See Dos deut. Drama des 19. Jahr., p. 10. But Platen had an especial dislike for anything that came from Berlin and the writer is unable to find any great attacks on Hegel's system in Platen's dramas as a whole. 44 Novalis said: "Die Poesie ist der Held der Philosophic Die Philosophie erhebt die Poesie zum Grundsatz. Sie lehrt uns den Werth der Poesie kennen. Philosophie ist die Theorie der Poesie. Sie zeigt uns, was die Poesie sey; dass sie Eins und Alles sey." Cf. H, 1, pp. 89-90.</page><page sequence="18">496 Porterfield and emphatically; Lessing in his "Pope ein Metaphysiker" said he could not. The individual student has a privilege and an obligation: he may and he must settle the matter for himself. Not even Plato, to whom German Romanticism owes so much, and who discussed this question on numerous occasions, can settle it for him. Nor can Nietzsche, the modern poet-philsopher, philosopher-poet. When the individual student attempts to come to an independent conclusion in this matter, there is one thing aside from the fact that the philosophers are discussed in histories of German "Litera ture," that will prejudice him in favor of the philosopher, namely, that type of Romantic symbolism that manifests itself as egoism. It is universally known that the Romanticists paid great attention to the ego, that they spent much of their time, as poets, in the ego centric predicament. This has, of course, but little to do with egoism as popularly understood. The Romantic philosopher used the term conceptually, begrifflich, not personally. There was some metaphor, some simile, some metonomy in his ega-ism. When Fichte spoke of his own Ich, he spoke for all mankind, and not simply for himself. And what did the poets do? According to a number of eminent scholars,45 they reshaped Fichte's ego to suit their own purpose. The ego of Fichte created the world; that of the poets stood oppo site the world and controlled it. Again it was a case of symbolism, not of immodesty. Now let poetic symbolism spread its mystic wings out over man's ego and all that pertains thereunto?and what does not??let him begin to explain his own frame of rnind, his how, and to ask a few questions about his why, let him begin to make some such remark as that the world is dualistic and yet monistic, for the world does not exist unless my ego allows it to exist, and the mind unaccustomed to concerning itself with such troublous problems will see philosophy in disguise, and that is the most awe-inspiring sort. But if this be philosophy, then philosophy is a harmless affair, differing from poetry only in that it cannot be scanned. The two shade off into each other most imperceptibly, but a line must be drawn somewhere, and for philosophy to be 45 Cf. Deutsche Literaturgeschichte, 5th edition, pp. 318-319. By Karl Storck, Stuttgart, 1908.</page><page sequence="19">Some Misconceptions Concerning German Romanticism 497 worthy of the name there must be system and logic and com pleteness. These are possible characteristics of Rationalism and to a certain extent of Realism, but not of Romanticism. (5) Romanticism and Catholicism. In his Romantische Schule, Rudolf Haym speaks (p. 524) of the "so zahlreiche ?bertritte von Mitgliedern der romantischen Schule in den Schoos der allein seligmachenden Kirche." The facts are46 these: If we take the fifty leading Romanticists, that is to say, Schleiermacher, G?rres, Fichte, Schelling, and the forty-six leading poets,47 we find that thirty-eight were consistent Protestants, five were consistent Catholics, two Protestants became Catholics, two Jews became Protestants, one Catholic woman48 married a Protestant and established a Protestant household, and two Gentiles49 had no formal church connections. In other words, out of fifty Roman ticists, forty were Protestants, seven were or became Catholics, two were noncredal, and one is rather difficult to locate.50 48 In his History of English Romanticism in the 19th Century, Professor Beers says (p. 137) : "Half of the Romanticists joined the Catholic Church." Profes sor Beers does not reckon the number of converts quite so high in other parts of his book, and in reply to a personal inquiry he most kindly and circumstan tially informed the writer that his source was either Heine or Wilhelm Scherer, more probably Heine. Professor Beers must have relied on Heine, for Scherer's statement in this connection is most conservative. See pages 626-627 and 629, 8th edition. 47 Alexis, Arndt, Arnim, Bettine von Arnim, B?rne, Brentano, B?chner, Chamisso, Annette von Droste, Eichendorff, Fallersieben, Fouqu?, Freiligrath, Geibel, Grabbe, Gr?n, Gutzkow, Halm, Hauff, Heine, Herwegh, E.T.A.

Or, Graf von Loeben had more to do with Romanticism than either Mundt or B?chner, and he too was a Protestant. The following did go over to the Catholic Church: Luise Hensel, Lebrecht D rev?s, the two Veits, the two Schadows, Klinkowstr?m, Overbeck, Adam M?ller, Rumohr, M?ller, Schenk, Plainer, Jarcke, K. L. von Haller, and</page><page sequence="20">498 Porter-field Of the seven Catholics, Eichendorff alone deserves serious con sideration. He was an orthodox Catholic, and his poetry shows it. As to the others, Annette von Droste and Anastasius Gr?n had very slight connection with the Romantic movement, while Bren tano had a big religious interregnum in his life, which is not the Catholic way of being a Catholic. Veronika Mendelssohn-Veit had become, at least in form, a Protestant Christian partly as a favor to Fr. Schlegel, and then he became a Catholic Christian partly as a favor to Dorothea Mendelssohn-Veit-Schlegel. It was a double compromise. Zacharias Werner had a temperament that would incite him to do one thing today, another tomorrow, and G?rres was not a man of letters. As to the Protestants who thought about Catholicism, that is another affair. Such poets as Novalis, Immermann, and Tieck were interested in a Catholic, a general, a united Church such as Novalis had protrayed in his "Christenheit oder Europa." They were flirting with an uncatchable will-of-the-wisp. They remained Protestants. And as to the aesthetics of the matter, that is still another and an infinitely more important affair. We know that in Germany today many of the Catholic church buildings are art galleries in miniature and that all men, except the hardened poseurs\ like ceremonials; but the Protestant church buildings preserve a barracks-like barrenness. As to Heine and B?rne, both of them became Protestants largely for social and economic reasons, so that neither of them calls for detailed discussion, unless it be Heine. The one conspicuous Hebrew of the movement, he became a Protestant, had himself baptized and renamed in Protestant fashion, went to Paris, married an arch-Catholic woman by rigid Catholic rites, concerned himself in no wise about the situation, and as to the Rabbi and the Monk, allowed one of his characters to come up with the pungent obser Princes Adolf von Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Friedrich von Hessen-Darmstadt. On the other hand, Arnim has Anton, the hero of the second part of the Kronenw?chter go over from Catholicism to Protestantism while Luther is. glorified as in few scientific treatises. Also, there were a number of important conversions from Catholicism to Protestantism during the days of Roman ticism. We have but to think of Aloys Henh?fer, Johannes Gossner, Martin Boos, priests who knew the Romanticists, especially Schleiermacher, and who? became Protestants so as to enjoy more individualism.</page><page sequence="21">Some Misconceptions Concerning German Romanticism 499 vation, "Dass sie alle beide stinken."51 In short, with regard to Seelenkultur and affiliation with the visible Church, Roman Catho licism played no great r?le in German Romanticism while German Catholicism played a very negligible one. The belief that the opposite52 is trae obtains rather generally for a number of reasons. The conspicuousness of the few conver sions to Catholicism, though historians are dumb as to the few conversions, fictitious and real, from Catholicism to Protestantism; the interest that attaches to the Catholic Church because of its temporal priority; aestheticism in all of its phases and as a product of the time when the Church was a power; mysticism that is attractive to all men and that is much more common than many men suppose; symbolism that stood sponsor for so many things; the inexplicability of the Madonna and Her Child; and chronology. It must be remembered that up to about 1530, everything ecclesiastical and religious was Catholic. If, therefore, a poet wrote a work and referred to the Church or an officer of it, that concerned time previous to 1530, then this church and this officer had to be Catholic. So far as religion is concerned, "G?tz von Berlichingen" and "Wilhelm Tell" are Catholic dramas, but for chronologic reasons, not because Goethe and Schiller were leaning 51 The closing verse of Hebr?ische Melodien. "One of the most illuminating discussions in this connection is found in W. Schlegel's S?mmtliche Werke, Vol. VIII, pp. 220-230. The work was written in reply to an article in a French magazine, entitled "Le Catholique," edited by Count von Eckstein, according to which all of the first class minds in Europe were becoming Catholics. The anonymous writer mentions a few who had gone over, and a number who had not, Tieck and Schelling for example. As to W. Schlegel he said: "Il est ? moiti? catholique." Schlegel denied the asser tion absolutely and said that he never could take such a step if, for no other reason, out of deference to his ancestors who, for two centuries, had been Protestant preachers. Then he takes up the matter of Catholicism in Schiller's Maria Stuart, and says that it was wholly a matter of confused aesthetics with Mortimer, for it was not the Catholic architecture which he so much admired, but that of Ancient Pagan Rome?the triumphal arches, marble columns, and the Colisseum. Schlegel says also that his " Gem?hide" have nothing whatever to do with Catholicism, that Boccaccio, Dante, and Petrarch were more Protes tant than Catholic, that Dante especially was more liberal than Luther, and that Calder?n and Cervantes were Catholic only because they lived in the days of the Inquisition. As to Mortimer's confused aesthetics, Grillparzer's "Die Ruinen des Campo Vaccino in Rom" (1820) is of interest. Schlegel's article was written in 1827.</page><page sequence="22">500 Porterfield toward Catholicism at the time of their composition. Tieck's "Genoveva" is regarded as an unalloyed type of a Catholic drama. Tieck did not, of course, have to write a drama on this topic, but since he chose this topic, he had to make his drama Catholic, for Saints Boniface and Genevi?ve lived long before the days of Protes tantism. Nor could one accuse the Protestant Lessing, on the other hand, of opposing Catholicism when he made the representa tive of Christianity in "Nathan der Weise" a debased Catholic. The Patriarch had to be Catholic, for the sake of chronology.53 (6) The age of the Romanticists. There is a well established generality, according to which the Romanticists died young on account of their vagaries, on account, indeed, of their Romanticism. The average age of the fifty main Romanticists was fifty-seven and three-fifths years. And if we eliminate from the list the six who died at the average age of twenty-five and one-half years, and none of these died young because he was a Romanticist,54 the average age of the remaining forty-four was sixty-one and forty three-forty-fourths years. Grabbe and Kleist, and also Waiblinger, died young partly because of the lives they had led. Kleist seems to have died indirectly from Kant, Grabbe directly from alcohol, and Waiblinger from general foolishness.55 And in this list of fifty we might eliminate, say, Mundt and B?chner, and sub stitute Jean Paul who died at the age of sixty-two, and H?lderlin who died physically at the age of seventy-three. 53 As originally written, the largest section of this paper was devoted to the Catholic-Protestant phase of Romanticism. Lack of space and the belief that the subject is worth a deta?ed monograph induced the writer to eliminate all except the bare facts. 54 Novalis and Ernst Schulze died of tuberculosis, Wackenroder, Hauff and B?chner of typhoid fever, and Theodor K?rner was shot on the field of battle. 55 Cf. Ausbreitung und Verfall der Romantik. By Ricarda Huch, p. 156: "Betrachten wir den Abschluss der Lebensl?ufe der Romantiker, so f?llt in der Tat ihr fr?hes Welken auf: Novalis, Wackenroder, Graf Loeben, der Maler Runge, der Physiker Ritter starben jung durch Krankheit, Lenau verfiel im Anfang der vierziger, H?lderlin im Anfang der dreissiger Jahre in unheilbaren Wahnsinn, Kleist, sein Leben lang mit Selbstmord und Wahnsinn ringend, erschoss sich f?nfunddreissig. Werner, Kanne, Brentano, Hoffmann erreichten zwar durchschnittlich das f?nfzigste Jahr." Huch sees then that she is approaching trouble with her generality in the case of Tieck, so she avoids the difficulty by saying: "Tiecks Bedeutung f?r die Romantik . . . liegt vor seinem dreissigsten Lebensjahre." This would exclude, among other things, Phantasus.</page><page sequence="23">Some Misconceptions Concerning German Romanticism 501 It would be difficult to select at random fifty poets from any other movement who lived on an average so long. At any rate, Romanticism had nothing to do with the mortuary record of the Romanticists. They lived lives not very different from other poets.56 Some were a trifle skittish, but others were level-headed almost to the point of being prosaic. A number of them attained a mature old age: Eichendorff was sixty-nine, Gr?n seventy, M?rike seventy-one, Uhland seventy-five, Kerner and Fallers leben seventy-six, Laube, R?ckert and W. Schlegel seventy eight, Schelling seventy-nine, Tieck eighty, and Ernst Moritz Arndt ninety-one when death interfered. A similar generality is that expressed by Heine and J. G. Robert son among others,57 who say that Romanticism was a revolt against Classicism. In France this was more or less the case; in Germany it was not the case at all.58 German Romanticism was a revolt neither against Classicism nor against the Classicists. It was a revolt against "senile intellectualism, over-cautious wisdom, and the dull common-sense of worn out rationalism, which, unconscious of its own nullity, flaunted untenable pretensions to infallibility."59 The Romanticists admired Lessing, followed Herder, borrowed from Wieland, learned from Klopstock, looked upon Goethe as the vicar of poetry on earth, and quarreled with Schiller for personal reasons, just as they at times quarreled among themselves. But they no more revolted against live Classicism than they revolted against virile intellectualism; they only felt that Romanticism and emotionalism are also good. 58 In his Geschichte der deutschen FrauendicJ?ang seit 1800, Heinrich Spiero says (p. 5): "Der Selbstmord spielt keine geringe Rolle, Schwindsucht, Irrsinn erscheinen immer wieder als Mitgaben romantischer Lebensl?ufe." Could there be a more misleading statement? Kleist took his life, just as did Charlotte Stieglitz and Caroline G?ndexode. But if we include such unimportant people as the last two, then there were hundreds of Romanticists, and these three sui cides reduce the average to such a degree that the cases of self-imposed death are of no consequence. 67 Cf. Zur Ges. d. Rel. u. Phil, in Deutschland, Elster edition, p. 273 and Goethe in the 20th century, Cambridge, 1912, p. 70. 58 W. Wallace, in his Life of Arthur Schopenhauer, also says (p. 49) that Romanticism was a protest against the Weimar School of Goethe and Schiller. 09 Cf. Evolution of Modern Germany, by Henri Lichtenberger, p. 380.</page><page sequence="24">502 Porterfield m But let us not exchange dogma for dogma; let us neither abandon tolerant synthesis that builds up and encourages nor embrace absolute nihilism that tears down and depresses. Rome and the Roman Empire are connected with some of the works of the Romanticists, for Italy was the land of their longing. Romanti cism can be defined, after a fashion, else there was no such thing. That which is can be defined. It did concern itself with the revivi fication of the Middle Ages, for the religious obscurity, civic loose ness, and latent individualism of Hohenstaufen days appealed "to Hohenzollern writers tired of being citizens of a country that consisted of over 300 "states," surfeited with the cold doctrine of clarity, and longing for something to do in the intellectual field. There was a cross-fertilization60 between the poetry and the philoso phy of the time?there has always been such in Germany. Catholi cism did play a part in Romanticism, and, from the aesthetic point of view, a very large one. No wonder. Everything was Catholic previous to the Reformation, which was followed by the devastating religious wars of the seventeenth century, so that with the appearance of the Romanticists, art that was art was Catholic art. It is with Romanticism more than with other phases of lit erature a question of relativity, of more or of less, so that dogma should be discredited and reasoning from the particular to the general severely frowned upon. The greatest and least dogmatic treatise that has thus far been written on German Romanticism is Rudolf Haym's Roman tische Schule, 1870. But for the undergraduate student in America this is a sealed book; nor can the graduate student control it except with great difficulty. Its subtile is "Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des deutschen Geistes," and thereby hangs a tale. Its contents faU into five nearly equal sections: Biography, Theory of Criticism, Theology, Philosophy, and Literature. The parts devoted to litera 80 In his Romantische Schule, page 357, Rudolf Haym makes the " Wechsel durc&amp;dringung" of poetry and philosophy at the close of the 18th century one of the most characteristic features of Romanticism, broadly speaking. As a type of this sort of "Romanticist," he takes H?lderlin. No one would deny the appositeness of the illustration; but the other poets, except those above listed, did not study philosophy as did H?lderlin, nor where they of a naturally philosophic bent.</page><page sequence="25">Some Misconceptions Concerning German Romanticism 503 ture cover a very limited field, the biographical matter can be ob tained in other and less costly places, the only way to derive a definitive idea as to the early Romanticists' theory of criticism is to read their own works on the subject, and what Haym says con cerning theology and ph?osophy is, to use an expression of which he himself is fond, "von sehr schwerem Kaliber." To believe, therefore, that one can derive the most complete idea of German Romanticism from the most bulky book on it is a popular misconception. The names of Arnim, Brentano, Fouqu?, Kleist, Jean Paul, Z. Werner and Grillparzer are barely mentioned by way of completing statistics, while the names of Heine, M?rike, R?ckert, Eichendorff, Uhland, Chamisso, Schwab, Kerner, Lenau, Platen, Grabbe, Immermann, W. M?ller and others of less im portance do not occur at all. Revolutionary though it may sound, a German scholar of Haym's type was not in a position to interpret, in 1870, German Romanticism to the American student of today. The American student can consider it an accomplishment of immense value if he correctly interprets Haym. But the general student of Romanticism, especially those in fields other than German, does not turn to Haym's book; he turns to the works of Beers, Brandes, Huch, Heine, Omond and general histories of German literature, from all of which he can derive a number of excellent ideas,?and a number that need the cautious skepticism born of mature investigation and the critical reserve that is the outgrowth of studied experience. Or the student of Romanticism goes to general histories of German literature' and is at once impressed by the fact that no two agree as to' who were the Romanticists.61 We must remember that it is with Romanticism as with any sort of organization: some are officers, some are mere members. The literary officers of the 51 In his Adelbert de Chamisso de Boncourt, Xavier Brun says (p. 348): "Plusieurs historiens de la litt?rature allemande consid?rent Eichendorff, Ernest Schulze et Chamisso comme les derniers repr?sentants ce l'?cole Roman tique." Chamisso's Schlemihl appeared in 1814, Schulze died in 1817, so that his Rose and C?cilie must both be dated 1817. It would seem then that these two do constitute the close of the "Romantic School," but how can we say that Eichendorff belongs in the same class in view of the works he wrote long after 1817? His Taugenichts did not appear until 1826 and some of his best poems were not written until at least ten years later. Anyhow, the classing together of these three writers can only confuse the average student.</page><page sequence="26">504 Porterfield old school at Jena and Berlin were Tieck and Wackenroder, the Schlegels and Novalis; of Heidelberg, Arnim and Brentano, Fouqu?, Eichendorff and Graf von Loeben. And the "members" of the Romantic movement were all of those other German poets who knew these poets, had their writings published in their magazines, sub scribed to their theories, corresponded with them, treated on the whole the same sort of themes, and so on. It is impossible, for example, to align Grillparzer with the Romanticists, though there is an abundance of romanticism in his works, just as it is impossible to make Richard Wagner a Romanticist, though, with the unique exception of Rien?i, he is unthinkable without them. On the other hand, Freiligrath and Geibel, so unromantic in many ways, must be viewed as "members" of the Romantic movement. Also, great differences of opinion prevail among even reliable writers on Romanticism. We have referred to Ricarda Huch's dogmatic statement that Tieck was dead to Romanticism before his thirtieth year. Fr. Kummer says:62 "Mit dem Phantasus (1812) nahm Tieck Abschied von der Romantik." Robert Rie mann63 has Tieck becoming ultra-romantic after 1835. Who is right? Such instances could be vastly multiplied. Even Rudolf Haym fails to emphasize the fact that so soon as Luther became a national power, D?rer, who hitherto had been, for chronological reasons a Catholic, became a Protestant and painted in Protestant fashion, as we can see by comparing his Allerheiligenbild (ca. 1512) and his Evangelisten (1526). Mysticism is generally noted as sure evi dence of Catholic leaning, yet the late Professor James shows64 that the Christian Church has always had its mystics, and that the only difference between Protestant and Catholic mystics is that the former are not so methodical. The German Romanticists never laid stress on method; quite the contrary. And if there be no romanticism in a Protestant "revival," then Schleiermacher's teaching and preaching were in vain. Much has been made of the Romanticists' golden age. But the idea was neither original nor pronounced with them. The philosophers of the age influenced the poets; but so did they influence the philosophers. Ricarda 82 Cf. Deutsche Literaturgeschichte des 19ten Jahrhunderts, p. 116. 63 Cf. Das 19. Jahrhundert der deutschen Literatur, pp. 37-44. 84 Cf. Varieties of Religious Experience, p. 406.</page><page sequence="27">Some Misconceptions Concerning German Romanticism 505 Huch says65 it was natural and agreeable to the Romanticists to be "berufslos," and Wilhelm Meister was the magna charta of the Romanticists. But Der alte Meister says:66 "Man kann einem jungen Menschen keine gr?ssere Wohltat erweisen, als wenn man ihn zeitig in die Bestimmung seines Lebens einweiht." There was nothing that the Romanticists were not. From all of this one thing becomes, possibly, fairly clear: Taken as a whole, Romanticism is not something totally different from Rationalism and Realism, and, since the student of the present knows a great deal because of the German Romanticists though he may not know much about them, it is to be hoped that the student of the future, standing on the shoulders of his predecessors and thereby seeing farther, will cease defining67 Romanticism as a sort of literature which is pure in type, unique in form, and unparalleled in substance. It does, however, differ in some ways from other kinds of literature and, on account of these differences, untenable generalities have been posited concerning it. The truth of the matter is, all literature is read and classified by those of us who are not poets at all; and when we read especially Romanticism we feel at once that we are in the realm of the novel. What does Novalis, for example,68 mean when, in his "Hymnen an die Nacht" he assures us that death is the romance of life? Such a statement perturbs the devotee of mundane accuracy, he begins to look for oddities in the life of the man who made it, and very likely finds them, from his own point of view, for Novalis 85 Cf. Ausbreitung und Verfall der Romantik, p. 138. 88 Cf. Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre, p. 31, edition of Erich Schmidt. And it seems to the writer that this phase of Willielm Meister has never been suffici ently emphasized. Goethe does not glorify the unemployed. Quite the con trary; he constantly refers, through the various characters, to the necessity and virtue of having a distinct calling, of having something useful to do. 57 In his life of Nietzsche, Richard M. Meyer says (p. 13): "Wir werden uns wohl h?ten, der h?bschen Sammlung von Definitionen an dieser Stelle eine neue beizuf?gen; aber noch viel mehr, der 'bequemen Verzweiflung (ein Wort Theodor Mommsens) derjenigen beizustimmen, die den Begriff f?r unbrauchbar und wertlos ausgeben." 88 In his Hist, of E. Rom. in the 19th C, Professor Beers says (p. 172) : "The sentiment has an alien sound. ' '</page><page sequence="28">506 Porterfield was a poet and not a classifier.69 This is one reason why so many misleading laws have been codified concerning Romanticism. Another reason is because of its extravagance. When the Romanticists did anything they did it with inspired vigor and energy so that it stood out as an enviable, or horrible, example. When Zacharias Werner became a Catholic he became one with all his might,?he who had just written a drama glorifying Martin Luther. When he preached Catholicism, the ordinary church would not contain his congregation. When Tieck revived the Middle Ages he did it with all the power there was in his prolific but not deep soul. When Hoffmann and Novalis portrayed the occult in nature, they did it so consistently that people came almost to believe that the romantic and the neoromantic were one; and then they read Justinus Keiner and were forever convinced. When the Romanticists had the five senses effect a reasonable exchange of functions?it has been called "G?tergemeinschaft der Sinne"? so that one heard colors and saw sounds, the arts were in danger of becoming slightly confused and poetry of becoming one with paint ing and music. But in a number of instances70 they preached, as strongly as did Lessing, the doctrine that each art must stay at home and mind its own business if grace it to be visualized and beauty clarified. Also, contradictions abound and inconsistencies flourish between the Romantic producer and his product. The facts of the poet's life and the truths expressed in his poetry are frequently at logger heads the one with the other. Tieck introduced musical instru ments as speaking characters in his Zerbino, yet he himself lived a 89 It might be well to recall that Schiller denied the Schlegels the ability to criticize Hermann und Dorothea on the ground that they lacked the necessary spirit however much they might have the terminology. The incident is related in S. Waetzoldt's Goethe und die Romantik, Leipizg, 1903, p. 47. If Schiller's observation be wholly unpersonal and correct, how many teachers would be able to teach Romanticism? 70 Cf. Tieck's Sternbalds Wanderungen, D. N. L., Vol. 145, p. 401. Castellani says: "Jegliche Kunst hat ihr eigent?mliches Gebiet, ihre Grenzen, ?ber die sie nicht hinaustreten darf, ohne sich zu vers?ndigen. So die Poesie, Musik, Skulptur, und Malerei. Keiner muss in das Gebiet des andern streifen, jeder K?nstler muss seine Heimat kennen." And Novalis said: "Grenzen der Mahlerey und Sculptur. Gang der Sculptur vom Ideal heraus, Gang der Mahlerey zum Ideal hinein." Cf. II, 1, p. 289.</page><page sequence="29">Some Misconceptions Concerning German Romanticism 507 rather humdrum existence, and as a man was most unmusical. Nor can we say, in the majority of such instances, that the one state followed the other; they were generally coeval. In this connection one recalls Dorothea and Fr. Schlegel. In 1809 they went to Wien. Madame de St?el called on them. Since they were known to her as Romanticists, she apparently expected to find them living on the house-top and wearing their clothes inside-out. But in Fr. Schlegel she found,71 in her own words, "ein gesetzter, gelehrter, behaglicher, geselliger Mann," going about the house, his loins girt with an apron, assisting in the preparation of the evening meal. Yet he wrote, or had written, Alar kos. In Dorothea she found,72 in her own words, "eine gesetzte, ruhige, stille, h?usliche Frau." Yet she wrote, or had written, Florentin. ?And when seen sewing, Dorothea replied in answer to the question why she did not ply the pen rather than the needle, "es gibt schon zu viele B?cher in der Welt; aber ich habe noch nicht geh?rt, dass es zu viele Hemden gebe." So far as the records go, no one ever accused E. T. A. Hoffman of neglec ting his duties connected with the law, that most rationalistic of all professions. Even Ricarda Huch says:73 "Er stand seinen Mann darin." Yet in his literary creations fancy runs wild and the occult beclouds normal issues. Eichendorff, one of the most industrious of men is best known for his happy-go-lucky Tauge nichts. During the last years of Arnim's life, three things were of peculiar interest to him: the rotation of crops, the best breed of sheep, and the best fertilizer for the soil. Yet he is the author of Halle und Jerusalem. Such discrepancies between the gay muse and the sober poet are, for evident reasons, a trifle more common with Romanticists than with Rationalists and Realists. They should not, however, make the historian blind to the facts and therefore blind to the truths that frequently do not grow out of these. Finally there is another reason why quaggy generalities have found lodgment in the spiritual granaries of those who should be more moral: the historian has not read his poet. He comes to Tieck, takes up "Oktavian," "Genoveva," and "Fortunat," and 71 Cf. Schelgels Werke, Bd. 15, p. 280. 73 Cf. Schlegels Werke, Bd. 15, p. 276. 71 Cf. Ausbreitung und Verfall der Romantik, p. 147.</page><page sequence="30">508 Porterfield in rarely compendious works a few others, and then leaves Tieck. But aside from legions of lyrics and one hundred and sixty-eight critical sketches on art and literature, Tieck published ninety-eight epic and dramatic works. Time must be below par to him who reads all of them, but to believe that Tieck can be done justice by reading only a couple of them is to imply that his creations are as repetitive as a Mohammedan prayer?which would be an act of self-stultification. Or take Arnim's "Die Kronenw?chter." To give the plot of this novel, as the conventional histories of German literature do, just as it relates to the guardians of the crown, is equivalent to palming off the ring story as the plot of "Nathan der Weise." As we have the fragment now, the guardians of the crown play only an episodic r?le. A better title for it would be: "Der Kauf mann und der K?nstler." Now no one wishes even to intimate that Koch, K?nig, Kummer and Company discussed this work intuitively. Albeit their presentations do not make it clear to the reader that Arnim's magnum opus is a comprehensive picture of 16th century Germany, and that the affair between the reigning Habsburgs and the ambitious Hohenstaufens is only one of the many pictures that pass before our eyes on looking into ?/.74 Oddness of expression, intensity of action, discrepancy between truth and poetry, and lack of familiarity with what the Romanti cists wrote have made the rise of generalities concerning them quite natural, while their manysidedness make the universal appli cability of these out of the question. Except for the sake of pedagogic convenience, it is unfortunate that a dogmatic label ever became attached to them. As. to heterogeneity, they have never been surpassed. With one exception, Tieck-Wackenroder, no one of them bore an enduring resemblance to the other, and they all followed, wittingly or otherwise, the unescapable law of mutability and changed with time. To posit therefore general theses concerning all of them is only to lead to misconceptions concerning all of them. That this has happened, is regrettable, for he is blind to actu ality who does not see that the German Romanticists are even 74 As to the various chronicles used by Arnim in the composition of his novel, see: Die Quellen und historischen Grundlagen von Arnims "Kronenw?chler" by Wilhelm Hans, Euphorion, Bd. 10, pp. 153 ff.</page><page sequence="31">Some Misconceptions Concerning German Romanticism 509 now being studied as much as any other half century of poets. We have irrefutable proof of this in the lists of new books in the various magazines. He is, at the same time, without prophetic aptitude who does not see that the German Romanticists will continue to be studied in the future, for it is impossible to think and escape them. And he is without cultural instinct who does not see that there is just now a real demand for the imaginative, for the roman tic, for prisms rather than prunes. If the student of the future acquires a more real and rational idea of Romanticism, it will be because he studies the Romanticists as separate individuals who constitute so many links in the unbroken literary chain, and not as a compact group resembling each other and different from every one else. E. T. A. Hoffmann was almost as dead to the signifi cance of natural nature as was Lessing. Yet Hoffmann was a Romanticist and the Romanticists were naturalists. The student of the future should remember that it is somewhat with Die Romantik as it is with Das Schwaben. Where is Schwaben? What is Schwaben? There was once such a place (and here the analogy weakens), but it ceased to exist in 1268. The technical geographer of today knows nothing of Schwaben. He speaks of parts of W?rttemberg, or Baiern, or Baden. There is no Schwaben that sends a statutory number of representatives to the German Parliament. Nor is there a section of German literature, neatly bounded and marked off, including just so many poets and no more, beginning suddenly in a certain year and closing abruptly in a certain year, monopolizing the entire period, and poetizing a certain type of subject of which no other poets have ever availed themselves, that constitutes Die Romantik. Yet there is Ein Schwaben and Eine Romantik. To view each member of the Romantic movement as a poet wholly distinct in kind is to be disappointed in the end, for we can find in others the same things we find in them. Wilhelm Schlegel was almost as much of a Rationalist as was Lessing. All men long, wonder at the wonderful, look forward to a Golden Age, take kindly to the mystic, manifest an interest in the past, and discuss the beauties of the ever-changing moon and stars while they have but little to say about the regular and rationalistic sun except as it comes and goes.</page><page sequence="32">510 Porterf?eld Literature is an artistic visualization and faithful reflection of life.. The three leading motives of life are hunger, love, and vanity. That is to say, hunger that is more than bread and meat, love that is more than sex and family, vanity that is more than rouge and ribbons. We might then be tempted into believing that hunger represents the Realist, for were not Hauptmann's weavers hungry? They were; but so were those of Heine and Freiligrath. Or, was not Hebbel's Genevi?ve hungry? She was; but so were those of M?ller, Tieck, and Raupach. And vanity cannot be made the mainspring of Rationalism, for all men are vain, all men try to calculate the future from the figures of the past. And concerning love, great literature is impossible without it. In short, pure types can hardly exist. Sebaldus Nothanker is Rationalism, Godwi is Romanticism, Die Wiskottens is Realism, but such pure types are rare.75 The poet cannot be consequential for any length of time, unless he is interested only in caricatures. Pure types of Romanticism are rare even in German literature despite the fact that there is a generality which says that the French are Rationalists, the English Realists, the Germans Romanticists. The matter cannot be so easily settled; the great nations cannot be so accurately alcoved. It were just about as reasonable to contend tha.t any long-lived poet will be a Romanticist until well in his thirties, a Realist until well in his sixties, and a Rationalist from then on. The generality sounds plausible, but then we think of the octogenarian Goethe writing the second part of Faust, the greatest work of German Romanticism according to Erich Schmidt, and it sounds unplausible. Or it were just as reasonable to accept Wilhelm Schlegel's brilliant aper?u according to which76 "Religion" comes from the East, " Sittlichkeit" from the West, " Poesie" from the South, and "Philosophie" from the North. This were a strange world if its spiritual manifestations were even predom inantly determined by the points of the compass. It is, however, impossible to escape the triple point of view. The two extremes necessitate the existence of the golden mean. Technique and content are so interdependent that the very exis 75 There is a superb discussion of the mixture and interweaving of literary types and tendencies in the introductory chapter of Richard M. Meyer's Nietzsche,'pp. 6-37. 78 Cf. Rudolf Haym's Romantische Schule, p. 855.</page><page sequence="33">Some Misconceptions Concerning German Romanticism 511 tence of drama, epic, and lyric argues the existence of Rationalism, Realism and Romanticism. But to believe that the extremes, Rationalism and Romanticism, beget Realism as a compromise is to reason falsely. Goethe may have succeeded in escaping the shallowness of Rationalism as well as the unbalance of Romanticism and becoming a golden-mean Realist. But even if this be true, it is owing to Goethe's inherent character, talent, and genius, and not to the way of the world. All three types of literature inter twine, overlap, and merge into each other as imperceptibly as do the studies of history, geography, and politics. And to believe that one poet is always an unalloyed Realist, another the same sort of Rationalist, another the same sort of Romanticist is to have a hazardous conception of the arrangement of things in the mansions of the seers.
