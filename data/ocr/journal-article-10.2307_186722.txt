<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXPLANATION AND TELEOLOGY* LARRY WRIGHT University of California, Riverside This paper develops and draws the consequences of an etiological analysis of goal- directedness modeled on one that functions centrally in Charles Taylor's work on action. The author first presents, criticizes, and modifies Taylor's formulation, and then shows his modified formulation accounts easily for much of the fine-structure of teleological concepts and conceptualizations. Throughout, the author is at pains to show that teleological explanations are orthodox from an empiricist's point of view: they require nothing novel methodologically. 1. Introduction. It is the central logical property of teleological characterizations that they explain what they characterize.t When we say 'A in order that B', or 'A for the sake of B', we ipso facto answer a question of the form 'Why A?' This is as true of functions as it is in the case of goal-directed behavior,1 but here I am con- cerned only with the latter.2 When I say the rabbit is running in order to escape from the dog, I am saying why the rabbit is behaving as it is. And since merely charac- terizing the behavior as fleeing implies that it takes place "in order to escape . . .," this characterization itself offers an explanation. If the rabbit is not running in order to escape, it is not fleeing. Similarly for stalking, evading, and anything of the form 'trying to X'. So whatever else a general account of teleological behavior must contain, it must at least provide the form of an explanation of this behavior; it must say something in general about why behavior of this sort takes place. This view is implicit in the three classic "empiricist" analyses of teleological (goal-directed) behavior, authored by N. Wiener, et al. [10], R. B. Braithwaite [3], and Ernest Nagel [5]. For Wiener et al., teleological behavior involves "a continuous feedback from the goal that modifies and guides the behaving object." Purposeful reactions are those "which are controlled by the error of the reaction." On this interpretation, teleological behavior "becomes synonymous with behavior con- trolled by negative feedback. . ." ([10], p. 24). For Braithwaite, behavior is teleo- logical if, starting from some specific initial condition, it can be represented as a standard (efficient) causal chain which attains or produces a specified final condition under a variety of environmental conditions. Nagel's analysis can be innocuously oversimplified by saying that behavior is teleological, with respect to a certain con- * Received August, 1971. t The research for this project was carried out under a grant from the University of California Humanities Institute. This version of the paper has benefited significantly from suggestions and criticisms offered by the editors of Philosophy of Science. 1 Let me avail myself of Braithwaite's distinction between goal-directed behavior and goal- intended behavior, or action. My primary interest in this paper is in the goal-directed behavior of nonhuman things, although occasionally an argument will apply to human action as well. I take the legitimacy of teleological characterizations of human behavior to be much less con- troversial than that of teleological clharacterizations in other contexts. 2 J have argued the case for functions in [12]. 204</page><page sequence="2">EXPLANATION AND TELEOLOGY 205 dition, if whenever there are changes in the system's state description which would, uncompensated for, take the system out of that condition, those changes naturally induce other changes which keep the system in the initial condition. (I have dis- cussed these analyses in much more detail in [11].) In each case, to say that behavior is teleological is to say something about the causal laws or mechanisms producing the behavior, which is to say something explanatory of the behavior. The sort of explanation offered by a teleological characterization on each of these accounts might be called 'etiological', that is causal3 in the broad sense in which any explanation aimed at showing what produced, or brought about the behavior is causal. This is, in a way, contentious. For there is a school of thought which takes teleological explanations to be sui generis, and a fortiori not to be understood in ordinary causal terms. And while some of the arguments from this perspective against the empiricist analyses have been telling, they have not, I think, been enough to justify calling off the search for an etiological account of teleological explanation. Three considerations urge this position upon us. First, an etiological analysis of teleological explanation would offer an escape from the eschatology and post hoc ergo propter hoc problems which have plagued the sui generist's accounts. Second, it would show teleological explanations to be explanations in a standard and clearly acceptable sense of the term, in no need of semantic apology or defense against pun. Third, and perhaps most important, if we accept human action explanations as a model of legitimate teleology, then other teleological explanations should be expected to share their salient logical features; and explanations in terms of reasons, motives, and intent are plainly etiological: they help us understand what brought about the behavior in question.4 So it is not at all absurd to suppose that the causal/teleological contrast represents a distinction among different kinds of etiologies, as opposed to a contrast between etiologies and something else. On the other hand, the empiricist attempts to carry out the program (those summarized above) have failed, legendarily by now, for a variety of reasons. Israel Scheffler was perhaps the trail blazer here with his catalog of "difficulties" in [7].5 But it is crucial to notice that, quite apart from other considerations, it is precisely their preoccupation with the underlying structural detail which discom- fits these analyses as adequate general characterizations of goal-directedness. This is so for two reasons. First, describing behavior teleologically-saying it is directed toward a certain goal-usually does not commit us to an exact function relating position or state description to time.6 Usually, from the point of view of an under- lying causal-deterministic account, a teleological characterization only restricts behavior to a certain range; it provides us certain broad constraints. Accordingly, 3 I use the term 'etiological' (and, later, 'etiology') here because 'cause' (and 'causal') typically is used in this context to contrast with 'teleological', and I wish to keep that contrast. Although the term 'etiology' has impeccable etymological credentials for this use, I have adopted it mostly because its current employment in the field of medicine is very close to the job I wish it to do here. 4 If this is not obvious, compelling arguments to this effect have been made by Charles Taylor and Norman Malcolm (both antimechanists, interestingly) in [8], p. 57 ff., and [4], p. 59 if. 6 For a detailed discussion of these and other difficulties, see [11]. 6 Once again, see [11] for a more detailed discussion of this point.</page><page sequence="3">206 LARRY WRIGHT within the appropriate range, determinism can fail without affecting the goal- directedness of the behavior. This alone prevents any deterministic substructure- unpacking from producing the desired result. But there is another consideration in virtue of which we should have expected analyses of the above sort to have been wide of the mark. In a large number of cases, the goal-directedness of a bit of behavior is obvious on its face. Many of our teleological judgments are as reliable and intersubjective as the run of normal perceptual judgments. Occasionally there simply is no question about it: the rabbit is fleeing, the cat stalking, the squirrel building a nest. Certain complex behavior patterns seem to demand teleological characterization. It is because of this that we have any reason at all to think that there is anything to give a philosophical analysis of. The notion is interesting precisely because it functions so clearly in these contexts. Accordingly, we should view with suspicion any analy- sis which contends that goal-directedness consists in a relationship among para- meters of which we are quite usually ignorant in the contexts of these reliable judgments. And in these cases we simply do not know the laws and state descrip- tions, the causal chain and variency, the underlying mechanism. Without further argument, then, an analysis in terms of coarser, more rudimentarily perceptual aspects of behavior would be vastly more plausible. From this vantage, the analysis of teleological behavior offered by Charles Taylor in The Explanation of Behaviour [9] represents a big step in just the right direction. His analysis, while still etiological, offers us something much further removed from the details of an underlying mechanism than any of those that went before it. It is the first one to provide us with something which can legitimately be called the general form of the account behavior must have when it is teleological. For Taylor, behavior is goal-directed or teleological, that is, occurs for the sake of some end, simply if it "occurs because it is the type of event which brings about this end" (ibid., p. 9). And his elaboration of this position makes it clear that 'because' here is to have etiological force: it concerns what brings about the behavior. In the very next sentence he holds that to account for behavior teleologically is to "account for it by laws in terms of which an event's occurring is held to be dependent on that event's being required for some end." Then later, and more elaborately he says ... (teleological) behavior is a function of the state of the system and (in the case of animate organisms) its environment; but the relevant feature of system and environment on which behaviour depends will be what the condition of both makes necessary if the end concerned is to be realized. (ibid.) Teleological behavior then has what might be called a "requirement etiology :" what brings it about is its being required. Moreover, in several places Taylor quite plausibly insists that it is often "perfectly observable" that a specific sort of be- havior is what is required for a certain end. Often we can see what's required. So this seems to be an analysis of the sort we are looking for. These are much more the kind of features we should expect to find in an analysis if it is to account for the actual deployment of teleological concepts. In point of fact, Taylor's analysis is much more exciting than it at first appears. With a slight reworking and clarification</page><page sequence="4">EXPLANATION AND TELEOLOGY 207 it will allow us to give an empiricist defense of several things quite generally dis- paraged by empiricists: final causation, anthropomorphism and teleological explanation not reducible to an underlying, deterministic causal mechanism. Now, there is some obvious conflict among Taylor's different formulations of his principle. He maintains that the difference between the "type" formulation and the "requirement" formulation is insignificant-merely apparent, superficial, should be ignored. This is questionable, and I will treat it in some detail below. But what is important to notice here is that these formulations are, in different contexts, very close to things we naturally say in embellishing and supporting our teleological characterizations in actual cases. Why did he do that? He had to do that if he was to avoid getting caught. Which is to say, he did it because it was required for a goal which he had. Alternatively, we sometimes say things like "He did it because that would get him around the obstacle." This is more like Taylor's first formulation: he did it because it was the type of thing which would bring about the end. Accordingly if we can use formulations of this kind as the basis of a philosophical analysis, we will have strong assurance at the outset that the analysis will offer us some insight into these macroscopic identificatory features of teleological behavior which are the source of our interest. 2. The Taylor Formula. The formulation Taylor finally settles on in The Explana- tion of Behaviour, the one operative in his discussions of teleological explanation, is somewhat more exacting, and hence more contentious than any of those above. It is, B occurs for the sake of G means: (1) (i) B is necessary (required) for G to obtain; (ii) B's being necessary for G is sufficient for B to occur.7 This way of putting it certainly seems more precise, and perhaps more easily testable than the others. And it might be urged that this formulation merely makes explicit the notion of functional dependency implicit in the others. But although Taylor sees very little difference among all these formulationis, I will argue below that the differences are very important indeed. Some renderings get us into difficulties which others easily avoid. Taylor is quite aware that on its most natural reading (1) is open to several objections, and he adds three qualifications about how it is to be understood. First, systems which are the objects of teleological descriptions obviously may have a specific end at one time (e.g. food) and not have it at another. So it is to be taken as implicit in this analysis that the event's being required is sufficient for its occurrence only when the end is an end for the system in question. To use Taylor's own example we can talk teleologically of a predator stalking his prey if and only if it is a suffi- cient condition for the predator's stalking that he have the goal of obtaining food 7 On page 10 (ibid.) he says, ". . . in beings with a purpose an event's being required for a given end is a sufficient condition of its occurrence." Denis Noble also adopts this interpretation [7]. Since Taylor does not object to it in his reply, it would seem to have his implicit bene- diction.</page><page sequence="5">208 LARRY WRIGHT and stalking is required to obtain it ([9], p. 9). Second, when he talks of sufficiency, or sufficient conditions, he is prepared to allow exceptions to the rule so long as they can "be cogently explained by interfering factors" (ibid., p. 14, fn.). Accord- ingly, the predator's stalking may be interrupted by a hunter's trap, even though he still has the goal of a meal and stalking will still be required to get it; and this does not mean that we were wrong to talk teleologically in the first place. Third, Taylor is prepared to admit that in many cases there may be a number of different acti- vities which would result in the achievement of a given end, and that these are normally selected among by appeal to some principle such as least effort. So he further qualifies (1) by including the selection criterion in the behavioral context so that we may "generally assume the selection has been made, and speak elliptically of 'the event required for' the goal or end" ([9], p. 9, fn.). Unfortunately, even with these qualifications (1) is still enormously problematic. It still encounters several telling objections and a huge array of counterexamples. But since it is so promising on other grounds, I will attempt to modify Taylor's analysis to circumvent the objections while doing as little as possible to alter its insightful appreciation of the subject matter. The most important modification to be made is to the (qualified) sufficient con- dition in the formula. As pointed out above, Taylor clearly sees that the subtlety of the relation between the requirement of a bit of behavior and its actual occur- rence in a teleological system immediately defeats any attempt to carry out this analysis in terms of an unqualified sufficient condition. However, his simple expedient of adding a clause excepting cases of interference is not equal to the subtlety either. Even with this qualifying clause, there are four distinct objections to using sufficient conditions here. First, and perhaps least importantly, it is very strained and artificial in some cases to describe as an appeal to interfering factors, the explanation of why a system failed to behave in a certain way in spite of the fact that such behavior was required for an end which it had. For example, it is possible that, instead of falling into a hunter's trap, our predator stops stalking because he is tired, even though still hungry and stalking is still required to get food. In this case, according to Taylor's formula, we would have to say that the predator's getting tired was an interfering factor. But if he stopped merely to rest, then presumably he wasn't even trying to stalk (at that moment); and in order to explain the interruption by interference he must at least be trying. This case is really just one of a large number of difficult cases which arise out of the fact that teleological systems (e.g. organisms) almost always can be said to have more than one goal. A very general difficulty arises here because quite often a system's attention is directed toward only one of these goals at a time. Accordingly, this selective attention would have to be characterized as an interfering factor to explain why the behavior required for the other goals does not obtain. This is in general a peculiar thing to say because, ex hypothesi, the system is not even trying to accomplish those other goals. This terminological artificiality is not in itself that profound, philosophically speaking; but it is relevant because it is, as usual, symptomatic of a deeper, conceptual difficulty. This will appear below.</page><page sequence="6">EXPLANATION AND TELEOLOGY 209 The second objection to characterizing the requirement of behavior as (qualifiedly) sufficient for its occurrence in a teleological system also primarily concerns the role of the interference clause. This clause seems to admit all sorts of bizarre accidents into the category of goal-directed activity, to the trivialization of Taylor's formula. Taylor attempts to avoid this discomfiture by including the term 'cogently' in his exception clause, but the criteria for the cogency of an explanation are not sufficiently straightforward to be applicable in most of the important cases. For instance, our favorite predator (suppose it's a feline), while resting between stalks, might be licking his paw, claws exposed, when a low-flying bird collides with the claws, killing itself and providing a meal for our still hungry friend. A very good case indeed can be made for saying that this rather disinterested exposure of the claws was precisely what was required to snare the unwary fowl. And if anything can count as interference, from having other goals to becoming tired, then it would appear to be impossible to adduce evidence against the claim that this disinterested claw exposure happens every time it is required to capture birds, barring inter- ference of course. Hence, Taylor's formula forces us to say, what is palpably false, that the predator was licking his paw in order to catch (or, for the sake of catching) the bird. A third and even more important objection is closely analogous to the "multiple goals" difficulty Scheffier raises against Braithwaite. Let's return to the concep- tually fertile predator, and this time suppose he is both hungry and thirsty. He does not see any water, but does see something which would pass for prey, and begins manifesting behavior which is, in some obvious sense, stalking. Before catching the prey, however, his stalking leads him to some water, and he pauses in his pursuit to drink. At this point Taylor's formula would require that we say the predator's behavior all along had been directed toward (i.e. for the sake of) obtaining water: Because he was thirsty; and he did just what was required to get water; and, barring interference of the sort Taylor allows, going to water always obtains when it is required to satisfy thirst.8 Q.E.D. But this conflicts directly with the fact that the predator's behavior was obviously stalking; it was obviously for the sake of catching its prey. In fact, ex hypothesi, the predator couldn't even see the water prior to exhibiting the behavior in question. Fourth, the (qualified) sufficiency criterion prevents Taylor's analysis from dis- tinguishing between functions and goals in some cases in which the distinction between these two notions is clear and valuable. There are, for example, many rudimentary activities such as sleeping and eating, which are periodically required for the attainment of almost any goal an organism might have. If an animal doesn't sleep for an extended period, it becomes less and less able to achieve even its most simple ends. Furthermore, barring abnormal conditions (i.e. interference), whenever an animal finds itself so tired that sleep is necessary for it to continue its everyday, goal-achieving activities, it sleeps. In other words, the requirement of sleep for these goals is (qualifiedly) sufficient to produce it. So on Taylor's analysis, 8 This last proposition follows (for Taylor) from the reasonable presupposition that it is sometimes correct to say that the animal went to a watering place in order to get (for the sake of getting) a drink.</page><page sequence="7">210 LARRY WRIGHT we would have to say that the animal went to sleep in order to achieve all sorts of goals the next day. But this is absurd. A good case could be made for saying that the achievement of all those goals the next day is the function of sleep. But no case can be made for saying that this is its purpose in any other sense. In fact, we might plausibly maintain in a specific instance that the beast went to sleep merely because it was tired-not "for the sake of" anything. But even in cases in which we might urge that the induction of sleep was goal-directed-e.g. he went to sleep on pur- pose-the best candidate for the goal of going to sleep would be relief of the feeling of fatigue, nothing more long-term than that. To ascribe long-term ends-in-view to animals-and sometimes even men-when they eat, sleep, play, copulate, etc., is to indefensibly conflate goals and functions.9 3. A Modification of the Formula. All four of these objections are circumvented if instead of saying that the requirement of behavior B is (qualifiedly) sufficient for B, we change the formula to read: the requirement of B causes, or brings about B. The difference between these formulas is subtle and may just have been overlooked by Taylor, who, I think, would regard them as synonymous. That there is a difference between them can be seen by examination of any of the recent sophisticated attempts to analyze the notion of causation.10 And it is precisely these differences which admit the four objections above. I will not attempt an analysis of causation here, and it is not necessary.' But briefly, the two features of 'cause' which allow it to succeed where 'sufficient condition' failed are: First, 'sufficient condition' applies to a much wider range of relationships than does 'cause' (there are noncausal guaran- tees); and secondly, the ex post facto, diagnostic nature of cause eliminates the need for "cogency" criteria which Taylor must invoke. The necessity of this modification serves, at bottom, to once again illustrate the unworkability of the usual deter- ministic-inferential account of causation. The relationship we are searching for here is obviously causal; but just as clearly, even a modified and qualified sufficient con- dition does not capture it. To demonstrate the power of this modification, let us look again at the above objections and notice the improvement effected by the new formula. First, the strained and artificial cases of interference simply vanish, because we have no need for an exception clause. The question of whether or not stalking is caused by (brought about by) the fact that it is required, doesn't even arise if no stalking behavior is being exhibited. All that must be established is that when stalking does obtain, it is produced/caused/brought about by its being required. And although this may sometimes be a complicated procedure, all of the philosophical and meth- odological principles are rather well-embodied in Mill's Methods. Obviously, this argument can be generalized to all cases of selective attention. The other three 9 In case this distinction is in need of any defense see the discussions in [1], p. 145 ff., [2] and [121. 10 For example, see: Causation in the Law, H. L. A. Hart and A. M. Honore; Oxford: Claren- don Press, 1959, Part I. 11 The analysis could of course go on tracing logical connections forever. A good place to stop is with a concept whose application is clear in practice, in interesting cases.</page><page sequence="8">EXPLANATION AND TELEOLOGY 211 objections can be dispatched rather quickly. It is clear in these examples that: its requirement to catch the bird is not what brought about the predator's licking of his paw; the fact that walking in the direction he did was required to get water was not what caused the predator to stalk in that direction; its being required for the next day's activities was not what produced sleep. So the modified formula relieves us of the burden of egregiously misdescribing these cases. One other modification must be made to Taylor's formula. To insist that the behavior B be required for a given end before it can be characterized teleologically, is to insist on a condition which cannot be met in many normal purposive cases. Nothing a predator does by way of stalking is in any strong sense required for the goal of food, although the activity is clearly purposive. Prey may accidentally walk (or fly) into a predator's unsuspecting clutches, or some fairly unsophisticated trickery might result in the same end without stalking. Taylor's recognition of this is what leads him to add the "principle of selection" qualification mentioned above. But the condition is still too strong. As long as accidents are possible, an end may be satisfied without employing anything in the organism's repertoire of purposive activities. None of them is required, even if we include the selection criterion in the context. Again, the way out is provided by introducing the notion of causing or bringing about. This is the terminology Taylor used in his earliest statement of the criterion but dropped it in the formulation he eventually settled on, either because he thought the two were equivalent, which they are not, or because he thought the former statement was too imprecise to be useful. However, if instead of saying that what causes B is the fact that it is (qualifiedly) required, we say that what causes B is the fact that it brings about the goal in question, we eliminate the difficulty of the pre- vious paragraph. For the fact that the goal is sometimes achieved by accident is irrelevant to the claim that it is, sometimes, brought about by doing B. Of course (as Taylor probably recognized) this formulation is too tough: a teleological B does not always bring about its G. Taylor himself occasionally employs a weaker one: B is the type of thing which brings about G. In some cases a slightly different weak formulation is preferable: B tends to12 bring about G. Satisfaction of any of these conditions would do. So the best way to state the general condition is disjunctively: B occurs for the sake of G if and only if B occurs because it brings about G, or because it is the type of thing which brings about G, or because it tends to bring about G, or, perhaps, because it is the type of thing which tends to bring about G. Using the 'tends to' expression to represent the entire disjunction we can then easily formulate this modification of the Taylor formula thus: S does B for the sake of G means: (2) (i) B tends to bring about G. (ii) B occurs because (i.e. is brought about by the fact that) it tends to bring about G. This way of putting it may make it look frighteningly difficult to apply in concrete 12 Accept this locution at its pre-analytic face value for now. I will have occasion to explicate it shortly.</page><page sequence="9">212 LARRY WRIGHT cases, and that may be what led Taylor to his more precise, albeit less defensible formulation. The question of application will occupy us shortly. For now it is important only to recognize that this embryonic looking statement of the formula in terms of results rather than requirements is the best that can be done. We had to exchange a rather tight statement employing a requirement-etiology for a much looser one employing a result or (better) consequence-etiology in order to account accurately for the most rudimentary properties of teleological systems. This is what the argument of the last few pages has shown. Behavior is teleological when it is being brought about by its tendency to produce a certain result, understanding 'tendency to produce' as including all the stricter formulations.'3 4. Testability. One of Taylor's two main claims for his analysis is that it avoids the charge of empirical undecidability which functioned so centrally in the vitalist controversy earlier this century. He claims, as we saw, that whether or not some- thing is required for something else is often the legitimate object of direct obser- vation. Consequently, whether or not this requirement, barring interference, guarantees the occurrence of some specific behavior should be testable, empirically determinable. If so, the crucial question now becomes: does this property of the analysis survive my modification? Is my sloppier formulation empirically demon- strable ? Since even speaking of behavior teleologically presupposes the applicability of (2), we must begin such a demonstration with behavior described nonteleologically. Let me use the term 'physico-geometrical' to represent this sort of description. Now the behavior we are concerned with here-that to be explained, to be charac- terized teleologically-can from a physico-geometrical point of view be of a wide variety of different kinds. It can be a certain path or set of paths (pattern); it can be stationary gesticulation, or it can be some other configurational change or pattern of changes; and of course it can be the complete absence of motion and change; and the motion or motionlessness can be with respect to virtually anything in the environment. Such behavior is quite often referred to using a demonstrative pronoun in its presence, and nearly always requires and presumes an ostensive familiarity with it for the adequacy of any descriptive expression. "Why did he do that ?" "What?" "What he just did, you know, go up to the edge, stop, and flail the water all frothy." "Oh, that. He was just trying to attract attention." Whether a bit of physico-geometrically characterized behavior will have the property we are interested in-whether it tends to bring about G-will usually depend on some details of the environment. Whether a certain path will lead to prey or effect escape obviously depends, inter alia, on the nature and location of obstacles, and other agents. So, by altering these features of the environment we can change precisely that property of the behavior on which the application of (2) depends. Hence, if we can show that the occurrence of a particular bit of behavior 13 It might be contended that (2) is what Taylor meant to say. Just possibly, this is what he thought he said. He didn't. But I do not particularly wish to claim he didn't. I am most interested in making transparent just what interpretation must be placed on his analysis to account adequately for the topography of teleology. And in this I do claim some originality.</page><page sequence="10">EXPLANATION AND TELEOLOGY 213 depends on the environment being such that the behavior has that property, we have empirically demonstrated that the formula applies: the behavior is directed towards G. It is valuable to see how this works in a spectrum of cases. For the most trans- parent illustration, we could arrange an experimental environment such that from a certain initial state, there is only one bit of behavior open to "agent" A that would result in G and this would be certain to result in G. We could then vary the environment to make other bits of behavior meet this same condition. If in these circumstances the B meeting the condition were invariably exhibited by A, then it would be merely a standard experimental design problem to assure that it was the satisfaction of this requirement which was bringing about B. Using the standard tools of random variation and variable matching, we could assure ourselves that what was producing a particular B was that that particular B was the one which would bring about G. And since this is one of the things which satisfies the quasi- disjunctive condition (2) i, (2) has been empirically demonstrated to hold. However, the stringent conditions imposed in this case are almost never met in practice. There are almost no circumstances in which there are not alternative methods and routines for achieving a particular goal. But the relaxation of the requirement to include these cases merely adds a complication: we just stipulate that the particular B exhibited always be one of the requisite set. In this case it is its membership in the set which brings about B, which is to say it occurs because it is the sort of thing which brings about G. This would satisfy (2) i as well. It may be wholly random which particular B within the potentially successful set occurs, or the occurrence of that particular member may be explicable in terms of some con- sideration such as Taylor's least effort principle. For our purposes it matters not. The applicability of (2) is indifferent to this further issue: once the preliminary test is passed, the formula applies. This shows that (2) is consistent with a degree of indeterminacy in the regularities governing the constituents of A and its environ- ment; and in this it represents something of an advance over Taylor's analysis. Much more important is the fact that the other part of the requirement must be relaxed too. We must be able to allow for failures of perception and execution in nearly every case. There are all sorts of ways in which behavior can fail to achieve its evident goal and still be directed toward it. We can objectively and intersub- jectively judge that the behavior exhibited was plausible, appropriate, the right sort of thing, etc., given G, even though the performance was flawed. This point is actually tricky and worth belaboring. The "sort of thing" which is "right," "plausible," and "appropriate" is specifiable physico-geometrically: a path, con- figurational change or pattern. On the other hand our recognition of the behavior as appropriate, even when characterized in these terms, may be considered wholly anthropomorphic: that's what I would have done, certainly reasonable, it couldn't have seen that it wouldn't work, etc. But this sort of anthropomorphism is not pernicious. As long as we are able to tell when the behavior has the requisite propriety with the reliability and intersubjectivity of standard perceptual judge- ments, our ascriptions can function in an experimental test; they are empirically demonstrable. And this we seem quite able to do in an enormous range of cases,</page><page sequence="11">214 LARRY WRIGHT both organismic and mechanistic. Jumping over the fence is, in some circumstances, obviously appropriate escape behavior, even if there is a net concealed on the other side ready to ensnare the would-be escapee. So if we discover that as the environment changes, the concomitant behavior is always'4 objectively appro- priate, though sometimes unsuccessful in one way or another, the formula must still apply. This is directly responsible for the ". . . tends to . . ." language in (2). Behavior is appropriate vis-i-vis the achievement of G only if it moves things in the right direction: only if it tends to get the job done. Interestingly, appropriate but unsuccessful behavior may well be the most central kind of teleological behavior, both conceptually and identificatorily; for it is the behavior of trying. And not only is trying one of the most emphatically teleological concepts, trying behavior constitutes the majority of that systematically complex behavior we are most reliable in identifying as teleological. The clearest cases of hunting, fleeing, and building consist largely of attempts-success is quite usually elusive. Furthermore, it is precisely trying behavior which functioned so centrally in earlier discussions under the headings of "plasticity" and "persistence" (see [3], [5], and [11]), which were there taken as the paradigms of objectively identifiable teleological behavior traits. What makes us say a predator is stalking-rather than writhing or undergoing spasms-is the systematic organization of the movements about the goal object, or about the obvious clues to the goal object, or about some- thing which might be mistaken for a clue. It is this systematicity which makes the direction of the behavior so obvious. And the particular systematicity which gives direction to a bit of behavior is that which obtains when the behavior arises because it tends to produce a certain result, e.g. the apprehension of prey. This kind of systematicity just is plasticity and persistence of the sort Braithwaite and Nagel were concerned with, but misunderstood. If we were to conduct a giant Mill's Methods experiment to demonstrate that what was causing a certain kind of behavior in some context was that behavior's tendency to produce a certain result, the description of one successful outcome could be put: the behavior was plastic and persistent with respect to that result. Of course details of such an experiment would in general be enormously difficult to specify from what I have called the physico-geometrical point of view. So perhaps it is fortunate that it is at this end of the spectrum that we are most reliable perceptually. I take the ease with which it handles trying behavior to be another significant advantage of (2) over (1). 5. Some Consequences. We are now in a position to eradicate two of the most important difficulties that plague discussions of teleology: the charge of anthro- pomorphism, and the apparent circularity of teleological explanations. The first of these is perhaps the more notorious. It is often alleged that to use teleological terminology to describe the behavior of things other than humans is simply anthro- pomorphic. And often we do fall back on suspicious sounding reconstructions like, "well, that is how I would behave if I were there." But although individuals may commit anthropomorphic mistakes, we have seen that there is nothing inherent in 14 'Always' is obviously stronger than necessary, but I am just trying to show some conditions under which the formula is empirically decidable, not to offer a general condition.</page><page sequence="12">EXPLANATION AND TELEOLOGY 215 teleological concepts that demands such mistakes. In a number of cases we have examined, no anthropomorphism whatever is involved in justifying a teleological ascription. So the categorical charge is false. Still, in the more usual examples, teleological characterizations seem to involve something anthropomorphic in the requisite propriety judgments. But we saw that these need only be objective, reliable judgments to serve adequately in (2); they need not be nonanthropomorphic. Furthermore, teleological behavior is not simply appropriate behavior; it is appropriate behavior with a certain etiology. Establishing the etiology is what is central to the teleological characterization. So even here, the teleological ascription is not even wholly, much less simply anthropomorphic. And what anthropomor- phism there is is consistent with a reasonble empiricism: there is nothing essentially subjective or mysterious about it. However, there is one further area in which the charge might seem to carry more weight. In those cases in which our teleological characterizations themselves are a matter of causal inspection of the phenomenon (much of higher organic behavior), what we claim to be perceiving is the etiology itself, not just the propriety of the behavior. We see that the squirrel is building a nest, the horse is going for the barn, not just that the behavior is appropriate for nest building or barn going. Here it might be maintained that we are simply transferring pattern recognition skills from human contexts to nonhuman. Wouldn't this be illicit, pernicious anthropo- morphism? Not necessarily. For here, as in perceptions generally, the reliability of our judgment is everything: to impugn a perceptual "skill" merely because it has anthropomorphic aspects, is to commit the genetic fallacy. We may quite legiti- mately rely upon anthropomorphic analogy to help us recognize complex behavior patterns. And a good case can be made for saying that we do employ some such tool in spotting the subtle differences in behavior which distinguish goal-directed behavior from behavior not directed at anything. For example, when we say that the motion of a cat's ear is for the sake of increased hearing acuity, as opposed to a fear or irritation reaction, we may well be "putting ourselves in its place" and char- acterizing the situations "from its point of view" and in terms of intentions, desires, hopes, and fears. The mistake (on both sides!) is only to confuse a recog- nition mnemonic with a justification. The anthropomorphic analogy may explain our insight into a complex phenomenon. The justification of our teleological charac- terization, however, has got to be that directive organization is the best etiological analysis or account of the movements; what is evoking them must be their tendency to produce a certain result. The correlation between this and our saying so is the test of our perceptual skill.15 And the discussion of (2) in the previous section pro- vides the practical framework in which such a test may be conducted. If there is a question of human perceptual arrogance here, this should help combat it. 15 As in any other case, the evidence we have for our perceptual competence here may be colossally difficult to state in any detail; it may nevertheless be fairly obvious that the evidence is good. It may be obvious, e.g. that if our judgment were very far wrong, we immediately would be confronted with embarrassing consequences. We say the dog is chasing the rabbit, but he overtakes the rabbit and runs right by; and then he destroys himself by crashing full tilt into the first obstacle in his path.</page><page sequence="13">216 LARRY WRIGHT Before going on to the second difficulty, a generally valuable consequence of the foregoing discussion should be drawn. There is a strong epistemological parallel here between the concept of "goal-directedness" and the class of concepts called "theoretical" in philosophical discussions of the observational confirmation of theories. Theoretical terms, in this context, are taken to refer to things which are in some strong sense unobservable. Hence, the justification for postulating them has to be that their existence best explains some phenomenon or other. Similarly, the justification for saying a certain bit of behavior is goal-directed, has to be that the best explanation of it is that it is being brought about by its tendency to produce a certain result. Furthermore, in some cases the goal-directedness of behavior is very difficult to detect (e.g. lower animals and plants). In these cases 'goal-directed- ness' would simply be a theory-term, being applied only after checking the con- sequence of its postulation. This strong parallel may have been what tempted the vitalists to postulate an unobserved entity to direct the behavior of organisms toward a goal. The difficulty with that position is nearly classic, and I need not rehash it here. The real illumina- tion provided by this parallel is on the observation/theory dispute. For it is clear that from a justificatory point of view, 'goal-directedness' always satisfies the episte- mological criteria for being a theory-term: Saying something is goal-directed is justified if goal-directedness (i.e. our formula) is the best account of that something's behavior. But it is also clear that in some cases, the goal-directedness of behavior is obvious, palpable, instantly recognizable, and unmistakable to the normally sighted individual. Which is to say it is observable. This suggests that from at least one very important perspective, 'theory-term' and 'observation-term' do not mark an epistemological distinction. The second difficulty mentioned above probably devolves to an uneasy feeling that there must be something circular about anything so involuted as the discussion of teleological systems on the last few pages. On one hand, I offer the plasticity and persistence of the behavior of a system toward a certain result as the empirical evidence demonstrating that the system has that result as a goal. On the other hand, I clearly want to be able to say we can explain the behavior of the system by appeal to its having a certain goal. But how can I explain the behavior of a system by appeal to its having a certain goal, when the evidence for its having that goal is a property of that behavior? Doesn't that really beg all the questions? Isn't that circular? I think that when the nature of such explanation is properly understood- i.e. in terms of the modified formula developed above-it is clear that whatever circularity there is, is not vicious. First of all, whether something S has goal Gi is clearly an empirical issue. One merely has to determine whether (2) is true when Gi and S's behavior are substituted in it. And this we saw was an empirical determination. But more importantly, (2) is true in this case only if S's behavior occurs because it tends to bring about G.16 This is part of what is meant by saying S 16 Recall that I am construing the notion of "tending to bring about G" broadly enough to include the objective propriety of judgments discussed above in the context of unsuccessful (but) teleological behavior.</page><page sequence="14">EXPLANATION AND TELEOLOGY 217 has goal Gi. So just saying S has goal Gi is to offer an explanation of S's behavior. This is why teleological explanations are ascription-explanations. What looks like circularity is merely the natural involutedness of ascription explanations: the con- tent of the modified Taylor formula is implicit in the simple statement that S has goal G. 6. Summary and Conclusion. I have been trying to show that (2) represents the best way to put the insight of Charles Taylor's very perceptive discussion of goal- directedness. Part of this has consisted in showing (2) to satisfy a variety of de- siderata: it accommodates the explanatoriness of teleological characterizations and explicates the notion of ascription explanations; it helps us understand why trying is so central a teleological concept; it squares teleological explanations with under- lying causal indeterminacy; it accounts for the role of anthropomorphism; and it shows how teleological properties can be the legitimate object of direct observation. But there are two other features any analysis of the sort I am proposing should have. It should be able to make some sense of the forward orientation of teleological explanations, and it should explicate the contrast between teleological explanations and what might be called "merely" causal explanations. Let me close by showing that (2) can do both of these things. One of the primary differences between (2) and (1) is that (2) offers consequence- etiologies as fundamental to teleology,17 in place of the requirement-etiologies of (1). It is this which allows us to account for the forward orientation of teleological accounts of behavior: it is a direct result of their focus on consequences. When we say that teleological etiologies are consequence-etiologies we are saying that the consequences of goal-directed behavior are involved in its etiology: it occurs because it has certain consequences. It occurs because it tends to achieve G. That, quite simply, is what the forward orientation consists in. And, as we saw, this involves nothing very heterodox empirically; e.g. in the experimental context, the causally relevant manipulation takes place before X, although the feature of that manipulation which determines whether X will occur (or be of a certain nature, etc.)-i.e. what governs the occurrence (etc.) of X-concerns what will ensue. So X occurs (etc.) because of what will ensue, but the statement of the cause is always appropriately put in the future tense: that things were such that Y will (tend to) ensue. And this statement concerns the state of affairs prior to X. Not surprisingly, precisely this same feature reveals the distinction between teleological explanations and explanations we call "merely" causal. A merely causal explanation of B would provide an etiology in terms of the antecedents of B, not its consequences. The causal/teleological contrast is among etiologies, not between etiologies and something else. The form of a teleological explanation of B is: B does or tends to do thus and so, therefore B. A "merely" causal explanation of B would have the form: other sorts of things do or tend to do thus and so, therefore B. This may well represent an empiricistically defensible way of making sense of the Aristotelian distinction between efficient and final causes. 17 I have argued for exactly the same position with respect to functions in [12].</page><page sequence="15">218 LARRY WRIGHT REFERENCES [1] Beckner, M.
