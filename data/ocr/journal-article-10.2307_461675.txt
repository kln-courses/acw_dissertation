<plain_text><page sequence="1">BARBARA F. LEFCOWITZ Blake and the Natural World SO MUCH critical attention has been focused on the imaginative axis of Blake's personal myth, particularly its stress upon inward vision, that sometimes one wonders whether Blake's poetry has any objective context at all.1 The problem becomes even more acute when we juxtapose against the various critiques on Blake's theory of the imagination his own well-known derogations of "Vegetable Nature," as in A Vision of the Last Judgment: This World (of Imagination) is Infinite &amp; Eternal whereas the world of Generation or Vegetation is Finite &amp; [for a small moment] Temporal. There exist in that Eternal World the Permanent Realities of Every Thing which we see reflected in this Vegetable Glass of Nature. (p. 545)2 Despite the equally if not better known lines on the importance of natural objects in "Auguries of Innocence," heaven and infinity would seem to have little or nothing to do with the wild flower or the palm of the hand. Yet to read the world of natural objects out of Blake is tantamount to read- ing the clay or bronze out of a piece of sculpture and reducing it to a confluence of spatial vectors. Further, diluting the objective context of any poet's work can serve only as a stimulus to those who seem to find a perverse pleasure in tossing around such vaguely romantic epithets as "mystical" or "mad."3 To help redress the critical perspective it is necessary to examine in some detail Blake's di- verse responses to the object world, responses that comprise a mosaic of different conceptions within the unity of his total myth. One brief note of warn- ing is in order: it is the ironic fate of most Blake critics to find themselves of Urizen's party, whether knowingly or not. My division of Blake's attitude toward nature into a number of sometimes over- lapping categories renders me as susceptible as any to that charge. I would also like to stress that Blake's motifs do not unfold in a lineal order of development; thus he may have a passage expres- sing the transmutation of nature into art at one point, and shortly afterward speak of the humani- zation of nature or of a vision of nature as fallen and delusory. Accordingly, I have taken the liberty of cutting across the entire Blake canon, sometimes violating chronological order if it seemed justifi- able as a means of elucidating a particular pattern or attitude.4 As already suggested, Blake's poetic response to the world of natural objects is considerably more diverse than a reader might suspect were he ini- tially to draw his conclusions solely from such antideistic credos as There is No Natural Religion or the more vehemently anti-Newtonian passages in Jerusalem. Although that which is corporeal may indeed be delusory or fallen, it is not always so; nor do those passages where nature is dero- gated as mere illusion really help us to understand Blake unless they are studied in their particular contexts. Thus, while I do not wish by any means to refute such studies as those by George Mills Harper and Hazard Adams, both of which place strong stress on Blake's antimaterialism, I believe their essentially monolithic viewpoint requires qualification.5 It should also be noted that at least one critic, E. D. Hirsch, Jr., repudiates the argu- ment that Blake is wholly antinaturalistic; Hirsch sees the 1790's in particular as a period of strong naturalistic affirmation, consonant with Blake's enthusiasm for the libertarian ideals of the French Revolution. The Songs of Experience, poems of the Rossetti MS., "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," and "Visions of the Daughters of Albion" all evince what Hirsch considers Blake's "radical naturalism" (Innocence and Experience, pp. 58-87). Indeed, the only valid generalization one can make about Blake's overall attitude toward na- ture is that he almost never treats it apart from a human context. This context can vary from simple anthropomorphism used as a descriptive device, to a stress on human perception (where the nat- ural object can appear as fallen or redeemed ac- cording to the acuity or "enlargement" of the senses), to a stress on human action or on the 121</page><page sequence="2">Blake and the Natural World shaping of raw matter into art. There are a few times, however, when Blake comes close to the objective rendering of nature found in Thomson and Christopher Smart; at these points human involvement is either minimal or so indirect as hardly to demand attention. These objective pas- sages constitute a first step in what I see as a hier- archy of natural response, which begins with sim- ple description and ends with the transmutation of nature into art. I. The Descriptive Mode "Then tell me, what is the material world, &amp; is it dead ?" ("Europe," p. 59) Generally, Blake's descriptive passages view na- ture as energy. Obviously, to equate nature with energy is one way of offering an affirmative an- swer to the question raised by the speaker in Europe, and also a limited means of healing the division between spirit and matter. It is when he is presenting his identification between nature and energy that Blake seems closest to falling into the physicotheological argument he elsewhere repudi- ates because it is based upon a static allegorical equation between the visible and the divine. For example, in "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," which may be considered as an extended celebra- tion of energy, both natural and psychic, Blake links energy with divine wisdom and plenitude: The pride of the peacock is the glory of God. The lust of the goat is the bounty of God. The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God. The nakedness of woman is the work of God. (p. 36) On the surface such lines recall the physicotheo- logical catalogs of The Seasons and Smart's Jubi- late Agno; yet there are significant differences. Blake is dealing here with abstract qualities rather than specific attributes that can be felt or seen (despite his theoretical preference elsewhere for the bounded and specific); moreover, his stress is not upon the second half of the equation, God's universe, but upon the simple fact of natural en- ergy or the exuberance that is beauty. It is interest- ing that even here the human element is brought into the picture. What seems like a straightforward celebration of natural order is quickly linked with a reference to the higher order of eternity, whose apprehension demands not only a human involve- ment, but an involvement more intense than that which is possible for "the eye of man" in its merely corporeal state: The roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging of the stormy sea, and the destructive sword, are por- tions of eternity too great for the eye of man. (P. 36) While expressed here as part of Blake's poetic content, any observation of natural energy that is merely sensory is not only inadequate, but ulti- mately unfeasible: so overwhelming is the force of that energy that it calls for a different, but as yet unstated, mode of perception. In "Visions of the Daughters of Albion" the motions of animals are incorporated into a moral statement that once again suggests a deistic frame of reference. When Oothon alludes, for example, to natural instinct all of her references suggest an energetic purposiveness within the greater context of the generated world: the chicken shuns the hawk; the bee creates his honeycomb; the wild ass refuses burdens; the spires of the worm "curl round the bones of death" like the spires of flame that dominate a number of Blake's illustrations. Yet, as with the passage in "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," surface resemblances to the celebration of natural "rightness" and order that we find in Thomson, Smart, and Pope must be qualified. While it is true that Blake does not directly introduce the need for a human partici- pant here, neither does he supply the answer to Oothon's questions about the secrets of the natural universe, thus omitting the kind of closed cause-and-effect statement about a divine architect we might expect in a conventional deistic poem. Another semideistic passage, this time from Milton, invokes a vision of natural phenomena within a context of order: Thou seest the Constellations in the deep &amp; won- drous Night They rise in order and continue their immortal courses Upon the mountains &amp; in vales with harp &amp; heavenly song, (pp. 121-22) The movement becomes that of a weaving dance, as the bright flies "touch" and "recede," "cross and change and return," recalling the cosmic dance as described in such poems as Davies' Orchestra. The qualification comes in the last two lines of the passage, where Blake calls for a tran- 122</page><page sequence="3">Barbara F. Lefcowitz scendence of the very descriptive mode he has been using. More desirable than such description would be a state of imaginative perception that enabled one to penetrate to the heart of the vision: But we see only as it were the hem of their garments When with our vegetable eyes we view those won'drous Visions (p. 122) Blake employs a similar thesis-antithesis approach to the description of natural phenomena on Plates 27 and 31 of Milton: natural wonders can be em- blems of the good, yet they can also be flowers of evil or components of a strikingly contemporary wasteland landscape. Likewise, the observation of natural phenomena may certainly give rise to pleasurable responses, but these responses are at best fragmentary and fleeting, part of the dream world of Beulah. Nature as energy does, however, comprise one aspect of the apocalyptic moment, both in Milton and The Four Zoas. Despite Blake's frequent in- sistence that the vegetative cycle of fallen nature must ultimately be transcended through a supra- corporeal vision and his implicit rejection of a merely descriptive response to the object world even while using the catalog technique of expressing such a response, his vision of apocalyptic unity in- cludes such emblems of natural power as the mounting lark, the wild thyme, and "terrific Lions &amp; Tygers" who "sport and play": All Animals upon the Earth, are prepard in all their strength To go forth to the Great Harvest &amp; Vintage of the Nations (Milton, Book the Second, p. 143) One might conclude that while Blake was will- ing at times to appropriate the same descriptive mode that informed most eighteenth-century topographic poetry, he appropriates it only as a means toward a greater thematic end, either vision- ary or humanistic; rarely does he exploit descrip- tion for purely esthetic effect or as a thematic end in itself. II. Nature Humanized The tendency to view nature in humanized terms is particularly strong throughout Blake's canon. If we consider the more purely descriptive passages on nature as comprising the first level in an increas- ingly subtle and complex hierarchy of poetic re- sponse to the object world, then those passages most clearly suggestive of what I have called "nature humanized" would represent the second level of response. In the descriptive passages, hu- man perception is either implied or introduced shortly after the catalog of natural objects; in the passage we shall consider next, the direct fusion of mind and matter is assumed, thus emphatically undercutting the possibility of a dualistic split be- tween the two. Lines from a letter written by Blake to his friend and patron Thomas Butts suggest in a starkly compressed manner a synthesis of the natural and human: . . . Each grain of Sand Each stone on the Land Each rock &amp; each hill Each herb &amp; each tree Mountain hill Earth &amp; Sea Cloud Meteor &amp; Star Are Men Seen Afar (from a letter to Thomas Butts, 2 Oct. 1800, p. 683) The possibility of such a synthesis is touched upon at other points, however, and can be found in the Songs of Innocence and Experience as well as The Four Zoas and Milton. In "Night the First," for ex- ample, one step toward complete fusion is achieved when natural energy, despite Blake's willingness to celebrate its powers elsewhere and even to include it as part of the apocalyptic moment, is allowed to triumph over "the Human Form" only in the negative context of the fallen world. After the descent of Urizen, human souls become clouds and The Horse is of more value than the Man. The Tyger fierce Laughs at the Human form. The Lion mocks &amp; thirsts for blood (p. 304) Clearly preferable to such a negative victory of instinct over spirit is that frame of reference which would perceive an empathic identification be- tween the human and animal: Seest thou the little winged fly, smaller than a grain of sand ? It has a heart like thee; a brain open to heaven &amp; hell (Milton, p. 113) The interrelation of all living things is a theme that Blake insists upon as early as "The Fly" and "On Another's Sorrow," sometimes expressing the identification between human and natural through 123</page><page sequence="4">Blake and the Natural World a conventional personification, as in Earth's An- swer: Earth rais'd up her head, From the darkness dread &amp; drear. Her light fled: Stony dread! And her locks cover'd with grey despair. (P. 18) Use of this all-too-popular eighteenth-century de- vice can often create a sense of detachment rather than the intended fusion, since the resolution is superimposed rather than allowed to work itself out through a poem's particular inner logic. Yet when compared with such poets as Collins and the Wartons, Blake is relatively immune from the worst effects of the device-its tendency to build a wall of pompous abstractions between reader and poet. One reason for Blake's relative success might be that he frequently encompasses the need to per- ceive an underlying unity between the human and natural within one of his many available mythic contexts. In "The Book of Thel," for example, he does not simply personify such objects as the lily, cloud, and worm, but vitalizes his personifications through the use of a dramatic format. The drama serves as a subtle morality play, one purpose of which is to suggest the psychological consequences of a failure to achieve full identification with na- ture. Thel can communicate with natural objects, but in the end she insists upon her essential detach- ment from them: Dost thou 0 little Cloud? I fear that I am not like thee; For I walk through the vales of Har. and smell the sweetest flowers; But I feed not the little flowers: I hear the warbling birds, But I feed not the warbling birds. they fly and seek their food; (p. 5) To acknowledge full identity with nature would be to acknowledge the inevitability of her own death. Thel lacks both the depth and the courage to in- corporate such a fact; like the heroine in Wallace Stevens' "Sunday Morning," she, too, "feels the need of some imperishable bliss." In Blakean terms, Thel resists giving up her detachment be- cause she is caught in a false innocence, one that would reach for an immutable perfection without risking the loss of selfhood-much as some people might wish to extend the easy certitudes of child- hood throughout their lives rather than face the inevitable loss of narcissistic power that comes with the adult compromise. Such people must inevitably take refuge in fantasy or in illness; Thel acts out that escape by fleeing back to the vales of Har, or the dream world of false innocence, a landscape that takes on qualities of an Absurdist nightmare when further developed in "Tiriel." Inadequate perception of the need for natural identity, which must serve as the first step toward eventual fusion of self and other under the aegis of the imagination, culminates in a stifling of the heroine's full psychological entelechy. While Blake is by no means a pantheist-in the Prophetic Books he frequently underscores the dangers of stopping at a mere immanence, where the vegeta- ble world is simply deified-at the same time he rejects any radical disjunction between self and natural object, spirit and matter. Because, unlike Thel, Vala is able to sacrifice her selfhood to the point where natural identification is possible, she eventually achieves the wholeness of vision denied to her mythic prototype: Alas am I but as a flower then will I sit me down Then will I weep then Ill complain &amp; sigh for im- mortality (The Four Zoas, "Night the Ninth," p. 381) The confession of her likeness to the grass that must pass away may initially cause Vala to lament, but the very act of confession is prelusive to an assurance that she will ultimately be able to tran- scend mere generation. Luvah tells her that: Yon Sun shall wax &amp; decay but thou shalt ever flourish The fruit shall ripen &amp; fall down &amp; the flowers con- sume away But thou shalt still survive arise 0 dry thy dewy tears (p. 381) The larger question of whether such an attempt to transcend the crucial problem of mutability can have much conviction for a contemporary reader we must, of course, leave open. It is sufficient to note for our purpose that Vala's confession repre- sents one step toward that culmination of identity between human and natural that marks the mo- ment of apocalypse in both The Four Zoas and Jerusalem. As one might expect, the apocalyptic passages express that fusion with some of Blake's most powerful metaphors: 124</page><page sequence="5">Barbara F. Lefcowitz For Lo the winter melted away upon the distant hills And all the black mould sings. ... The roots shoot thick thro the solid rocks bursting their way They cry out in joys of existence, the broad stems Rear on the mountains stem after stem the scaly newt creeps From the stone &amp; the armed fly springs from the rocky crevice The spider. The bat burst from the hardened slime crying To one another What are we &amp; whence is our joy &amp; delight (The Four Zoas, "Night the Ninth," p. 386) All Human Forms identified even Tree Metal Earth &amp; Stone. all Human Forms identified, living going forth &amp; re- turning wearied Into the Planetary lives . . . (Jerusalem, p. 256) Yet except for parts of "The Book of Thel" the preceding passages are still largely statements, rather than attempts to exploit in any dramatic way the special link between the object world and human perception or human action. III. Nature and Action His Giant beauty and perfection fallen into dust: Till from within his witherd breast grown narrow with his woes: The corn is turn'd to thistles &amp; the apples into poison: (Jerusalem, p. 162) For a fuller understanding of Blake's attitude toward nature we must now consider those pas- sages where the natural world is specifically viewed as one element in the landscape of human expe- rience. In terms of our hierarchy of possible re- sponses to nature, these would encompass a point where the human element begins to separate itself from the object world and assume a measure of control over that world; objects become exten- sions or projections of the human. In the descrip- tive passages discussed earlier, human involvement was simply implied; in the passages that suggest a metaphorical identity between the human and natural, such as the apocalyptic scene in The Four Zoas, the need for that involvement was more strongly and directly underscored, though largely through statement. Now we move to a point where the equation is qualified in order to reveal Blake's belief that the primary responsibil- ity for achieving apocalyptic unity resides not in external nature but in man. It is here that we see Blake most strongly repudi- ating Locke and most closely approaching the esse est percipi of Berkeley. According to the Lockean view, external reality is primal, and the mind is merely a passive receptor of the various impingements of that reality upon the senses. Blake would reverse the thesis so that nature be- comes passive and the mind of man active to the point where its perceptions and actions can truly alter the state of the object world. The word "pas- sive" should not, however, be taken as equivalent with "lifeless" when discussing Blake; indeed the words "malleable" or "plastic" might be more accurate, since the corporeal world is only inani- mate when seen through the delusory single vision of Newton and Locke. In somewhat different terms, nature now be- comes the objective correlative of either percep- tion or will. If perception is stifled by a Urizenic in- sistence upon the opacity of purely abstract rea- son, nature appears as fallen (Ulro or Generation); if perception is enlarged to its full imaginative po- tential (Eden), nature will correspond to that superior perception. Likewise, if the human will insists upon tyrannical extension of its brute power, the natural world of the poems will take on images of darkness and terror; if the will is tem- pered by pity, mercy, and love, the corresponding descriptions of natural response will take on more positive connotations. Because it has been dealt with less frequently than the problem of percep- tion, I shall concentrate first on the correlations between natural landscape and acts of the human will. One should bear in mind, however, that per- ception and will are closely intertwined in Blake; indeed, as the contrasting fates of Thel and Vala suggest, one cannot begin to take proper action or exercise the will in an efficacious manner without first cleansing the senses of all that is defined by either materialism or egocentricity. Changes in the natural landscape in response to acts of the human will are especially prominent in the most Gothic of all the Prophetic Books, The Four Zoas. Sometimes the imagery combines a powerful lyricism with only a suggestion of the darkness and chaos characteristic of sublime terror; elsewhere, despite his dislike of Edmund Burke's Philosophical Enquiry, Blake's imagery 125</page><page sequence="6">Blake and the Natural World reads as much like a Baedeker of Burke's dark sublime as some of the exotic effects exploited by the Gothic novelists. After the descent of Urizen as a false messiah in "Night the First," a vision of fiery chariots and throngs of rejoicing spirits gives way to a rela- tively calm landscape, where Earth spreads her table and "the Night a silver cup / Fill'd with the wine of anguish waited at the golden feast" (p. 303). The image of a contained "wine of anguish" affirms the sense of temporary equilibrium sug- gested by the passage as a whole: a feast for a false messiah can, at best, bring a momentary en- closure of sorrow. With dawn the harmony will be broken, the pastoral landscape will shatter, and the nuptial song of Los and Enitharmon will turn into a lament. In terms of our specific problem, the descent of Urizen as Prince of Light is antithetical to the emergence of the authentic light-bearers in Blake's world, Los and Christ; hence the "bright Sun" does not now illuminate the corresponding landscape. Because true visionary expansion has not yet occurred, the sun must conceal itself else- where: ... he filling all the expanse Slept as a bird in the blue shell that soon shall burst away (p. 303) The last line also shows to what extent Blake can appropriate conventional nature imagery and in- corporate it into the special terms of his myth. The sun, symbol for the light of reason and insight in Plato and elsewhere, is transmuted into a bird, Plato's symbol for passion and the imagination. Through this change Blake indicates the primacy of imagination over mere reason. But the bird cannot soar: Los cannot triumph over Urizen be- cause he is still trapped in the blue shell, the mun- dane shell of the fallen world. The whole landscape that appears as a result of Urizen's tyrannical will is, then, but a mock- pastoral, a landscape of containment and contrac- tion. As if to underscore the artificial nature of the scene he has created, Blake indulges shortly afterwards in the very type of vague "poetic dic- tion" ("purple night and crimson morning &amp; golden day") that marked the conventional nature poetry of the eighteenth century, a diction notable for its cloying abstraction and stock imagery. Urizen's descent culminates in a fall from primal unity, bringing with it the delusory vision of scientific materialism. In response, ... Ice &amp; Snow Tend the dire anvils. Mountains mourn &amp; Rivers faint &amp; fail There is no City nor Corn-field nor Orchard! all is Rock &amp; Sand There is no Sun nor Moon nor Star. but rugged wintry rocks (p. 305) Winter becomes a state of mind, a response to a superimposition of the human will. But nature can respond both positively and negatively to the human will, just as the mind it- self can create an infernal landscape of winter or an Edenic landscape of spring, depending on its degree of visionary perception. This dual possibil- ity is made clear in "Night the Sixth," when Urizen confronts some of the beings who populate the fallen world. Separated from genuine harmony with the object world because of his determination to order and control that world, Urizen rants in vain at the lion and scorpion. The very rocks, clouds, and mountains begin to attack him, and he suffers defeat just as Satan suffered defeat in the War in Heaven. But Blake explicitly claims that war with nature is neither constant nor necessary: ... A Rock a Cloud a Mountain Were not now Vocal as in Climes of happy Eternity Where the lamb replies to the infant voice &amp; the lion to the man of years (p. 341) One of the more dramatic natural correspon- dences to the human will is exemplified by the Tree of Mystery, Blake's equivalent for the Edenic Tree of Knowledge. Having reduced herself to the level of sheer physical sensation, Enitharmon at one point divides into a shadow figure; her shadow sits beneath the tree as it "Began to blossom in fierce pain shooting its writhing buds" (p. 350). The phenomenon of a tree bearing fruit as a result of an act of human will is, of course, familiar to us from one of the best-known Songs of Experi- ence, "A Poison Tree." There the correspondence between human and natural is even more pro- nounced, the use of a first-person narrator pulling the reader into the poem with a greater immediacy than Blake could attain when using the symbolic displacements of the Prophetic Books. "The apple bright" of the poem suggests not only a particular version of the biblical myth of the Fall, but a pro- cess where intense emotion, repressed because of binding social codes, is rendered into a tangible symbol. The poem thus incorporates an excellent illustration of one aspect of the symbol-making 126</page><page sequence="7">Barbara F. Lefcowitz process itself, an aspect that touches upon an- other means of healing the subject-object split. When a strongly felt emotion is denied direct ex- pression, it will "go underground," as it were, taking temporary refuge in the unconscious mind until it can reemerge in a safely disguised form. As with a dream symbol, the rage-turned-apple can then make its presence known to the con- scious mind and thus afford a measure of release. In the fantasy embodied by this particular poem, the symbolic action is even more successful than one attained through a mere dream: the speaker creates his symbol and is also allowed the pleasure of seeing it take effect on his enemy. To return more specifically to the correspon- dence between nature and human action, we may note that another passage in The Four Zoas claims that the natural world is actually a thrall to human power. Blake is not, however, expressing the modern shibboleth that man can control all manner of natural forces: he is simply affirming in yet another way that nature can "feel" human power and respond accordingly. The stress is not upon human control in the manner of a Urizenic tyranny over the skies and waters, but on the flexibility of the natural world: ... the rocks the desarts feel his power They shake their slumbers off. ("Night the Eighth," p. 367) All the emblems of natural energy gather to par- ticipate in the coming redemption. Just as con- flicting forces will unify within the human psyche as a sine qua non of personal redemption, so cos- mic wholeness will express itself in the object world through a vision of release and return: ... the bursting Universe explodes All things reversd flew from their centers rattling bones To bones Join, shaking convulsd the shivering clay breathes (p. 377) Far from being a colorless mass of atoms or a vale of mere delusion, then, the natural world can burst into full life when the human spirit is ready to for- go selfish acts. The tiger will return to help cele- brate the moment of release, rather than serve as an analogue of terror; the "shivering clay" will breathe rather than tremble into night-storms. Yet it would be misleading if one assumed that proper action, as conditioned by such moral im- peratives as pity and mercy, is Blake's primary means of fusing nature and self. Any human ac- tion, whether inward or outward, must be pre- ceded by the proper perceptual condition, for without "enlargement of the senses" man cannot make any truly free response to his world. If he tries to act without the proper perception, he will become but a rote follower of social codes im- posed from without rather than a free agent of his own imagination. If the senses are closed and the imagination fragmented, nature will appear as fallen; if the way to the imagination is open, then the "dark and intricate caves" will-ideally at least-give way to Golgonooza, the holy city of art. IV. Nature and Perception "A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees." ("The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," p. 35) Not only can proper vision alter the shapes and colors of the object world, but it can actually in- fluence the relationship between man and nature. The point is expressed with haunting lyric com- pression in two Songs of Experience, "Little Girl Lost" and "Little Girl Found." Indeed, the lyric appeal of these poems helps to overcome some of the inevitable resistance many readers might feel toward the hyperbole of Blake's philosophical argument. In the first poem Blake begins by relat- ing his prophetic stance to the earthly insurrection that will eventually follow upon the cycle of inno- cence and experience: In futurity I prophetic see, That the earth from sleep, (Grave the sentence deep) Shall arise and seek For her maker meek: And the desart wild Become a garden mild. (p. 20) Meanwhile Lyca, who is related to a number of other mythic figures (Thel, Oothon, Ahania, Vala) engaged in acting out versions of the descent and rebirth cycle, wanders through the wild desert un- til she falls asleep.6 Like Thel, she is at the thresh- old of experience, but unlike that particular paradigm of the self-contained spirit, she allows herself to enter into the world of natural energy; moreover, she does this despite awareness that her parents not only are reluctant to let her go, but will suffer as a consequence. In response to her action the beasts of prey become protectors rather than threats: 127</page><page sequence="8">Blake and the Natural World The kingly lion stood And the virgin view'd Then he gambold round O'er the hallowd ground: Leopards, tygers play, Round her as she lay; While the lion old, Bow'd his mane of gold. (p. 21) Yet this particular transformation results in but a fragmentary resolution: natural energy may be chastened because it has been recognized rather than repressed, but Lyca is, after all, largely a pas- sive figure in the landscape. The animals gather around her as she sleeps; thus if any visionary or perceptual breakthrough has occurred, it is at this point only on the unconscious level of the dream. In specifically Blakean terms, Lyca may have reached Beulah, but she is far from the complete visionary experience of Eden. In the companion poem, however, a real per- ceptual change does take place, all the more sig- nificant because it takes place in the minds of Lyca's parents. After seven fruitless days of search, they dream that they see their child "famished, weeping, weak" as she wanders through the desert. When they resume their search they meet a lion who first frightens them but then licks their hands in a gesture of conciliation and protection. The moment of vision for Lyca's parents, though it is implicit rather than directly stated, occurs after line 32: "And silent by them he stands" (p. 22). From that point on, we see the salutary effects of their vision: first the parents look at the lion's eyes, then see him transformed from a beast of prey into an angelic spirit "arm'd in gold." He leads them to the sleeping Lyca as they begin to follow out the path of their vision. Not only do they discover that their child sleeps safely "among tygers wild," but they, too, are able to live within the landscape of experience without fearing that the instinctual forces of natural energy will destroy them. Repres- sive reason has been chastened by vision, and this in turn chastens the natural world. It should be noted, of course, that in these two poems the visionary cycle is superimposed from without, thus suggesting a deterministic process, one that offers no particular hope that the imagination can effect similar changes in a purely autonomous fashion. We are not told enough about Lyca's parents to know why or how they were able to attain "proper" vision, nor do we learn what happens when Lyca wakes up, or whether she is truly able to undertake the crucial step of translating dream knowledge into reality. As paradigms of what can happen in the relation- ship between human subject and natural object, the Lyca poems are most suggestive, but as ex- plicit maps of the way toward vision, they are- as one might expect of lyric poems-decidedly mysterious and open-ended. As happens so often in literature, it is the fallen world that is most open to powerful poetic state- ment, just as evil characters stand out with par- ticular force in the drama and novel. A number of striking passages in both Milton and Jerusalem show how inadequate perception, proceeding from eyes that are "little narrow orbs" and ears that are "little shells" closing out melody in favor of dis- cord, can alter the natural landscape much as the tyranny of the Urizenic will can effect similar ends. In Jerusalem, for example, Blake claims that the organs of perception can be contracted "into Worms" or expanded "into Gods." Contraction can lead only to the lowest realm of reality (Ulro Visions); these visions select only the most nega- tive aspects of nature and then generalize them into a pattern of waste and decay: And then behold! what are these Ulro Visions of Chastity[ ?] Then as the moss upon the tree: or dust upon the plow: Or as the sweat upon the labouring shoulder: or as the chaff Of the wheat-floor or as the dregs of the sweet wine- press. (p. 203; italics mine) The objects of contracted perception sometimes take on a phantasmagoric quality, where the sun is black and the moon rolls chaotically through a vast void. In Chapter iii of Jerusalem the eagle and lion, elsewhere emblems of a natural energy open to regenerative incorporation, wander over the wilderness until they separate themselves com- pletely from man: The Sun forgets his course like a drunken man; he hesitates, Upon the Cheselden hills, thinking to sleep on the Severn In vain: he is hurried afar into an unknown Night He bleeds in torrents of blood as he rolls thro heaven above 128</page><page sequence="9">Barbara F. Lefcowitz He chokes up the paths of the sky; the Moon is leprous as snow: (p. 217) The last passage in particular suggests the sun- dered natural world of Donne's Anniversary Poems. Yet there is a crucial difference: for Donne, who is appropriating the myth of natural decline popular in the early seventeenth century, the lack of coherence has a supernatural rather than a humanistic basis; at best, nature is in a state of de- cay because of original sin, an act of human weak- ness dating from the distant past. For Blake, how- ever, coherence shatters into separation and chaos because of a present-and remediable-error of human psychology. One vision is deeply pessi- mistic, offering salvation only through a religious transcendence along the lines of orthodox Chris- tianity. Blake's vision offers, on the other hand, a qualified optimism, where salvation is not only possible within an earthly context, but accessible to all who would take the inward journey. The sun can shed its blackness, having "found a fresher morning." V. Nature and Art "All things acted on Earth are seen in the Bright Sculp- tures of Los's Halls &amp; every Age renews its powers from these Works" (Jerusalem, p. 159) We come now to the last and most positively charged of Blake's responses to the object world: the transmutation of natural energy into art. Whereas nature had been essentially passive when subsumed under the power of either will or the senses, now it is regarded rather as a dynamic or flowing force, which can be rendered into objects of shining permanence under the command of Los, symbolic representation of the creative imagina- tion. Golgonooza, Los's eternal city of art, is per- haps the best-known symbol of the creative re- demption of nature, but as always with Blake there are a number of parallel symbols as well as countersymbols, analogues of anticreation. In terms of the city symbol, there is the fallen, de- generate city of Babylon as well as the regenerative cities of Golgonooza and Jerusalem; in terms of the creative process itself, there is Urizen's con- densation of natural flux into solid rock as well as Los's fiery refinement of matter into sculpture. Rather than simply retrace the Golgonooza symbol, which has been amply discussed by North- rop Frye and Harold Bloom7 among others, I shall concentrate on the hitherto undiscussed transmu- tation of nature into jewels, particularly since the jewel motif offers a direct expression of Blake's vision of creative possibility. Like the city motif, it can function both positively and negatively. It first appears in "Little Girl Lost," when the flam- ing eyes of the lion begin to yield "ruby tears" as part of a generalized chastening process, in which, as we have seen, natural energy is subsumed under an act of creative perception. In "America," the juxtaposition of fire and metal or jewels is uti- lized in a less direct but more suggestive manner when Blake draws upon the imagery of Nebuchad- nezzar's dream from the Book of Daniel in order to complete his portrait of the redeemed man, the man who will rise in a "fiery joy" when the revolu- tionary spirit of Ore replaces the stony laws of Urizen: Fires inwrap the earthly globe, yet man is not con- sumd; Amidst the lustful fires he walks: his feet become like brass, His knees and thighs like silver, &amp; his breast and head like gold. (p. 53) Though the passage does not deal specifically with artistic creation, there is a suggestion that the es- sence of the human spirit can attain a hardness and durability of form that will be capable of sus- taining itself against the ravages of the genera- tional world at its worst. Here fire is conceived as a destructive force, or as the lustful fire that seeks to annihilate the "fiery joy" or purgatorial (and thus potentially creative) fire that the Promethean Orc would bring to man. There is as yet no de- velopmental link between fire and transmuted ob- ject, merely an implication of possible relation- ships: fire (natural energy) can be both creative and destructive; as a counterforce to the latter there is the possibility that the vulnerability of the human flesh can be overcome by a transmutation of flesh into a metallic hardness that will resist the destructive flame. Just as we are not told how or why Lyca's parents achieved vision, so we are not told how man becomes brass or gold: he simply does so. Fire becomes a direct agent of artistic creation in the furnaces of Los, themselves composed of translucent beryl and emeralds: ... I drew forth the pang Of sorrow red hot: I workd it on my resolute anvil: 129</page><page sequence="10">Blake and the Natural World I heated it in the flames of Hand, &amp; Hyle, &amp; Coban Nine times; Gwendolen &amp; Cambel &amp; Gwineverra Are melted into the gold, the silver, the liquid ruby, The crysolite, the topaz, the jacinth, &amp; every pre- cious stone. (Jerusalem, p. 151) Here Blake sets up a pattern whereby natural evil, exemplified within the terms of his myth by such sinister figures as Hand, Hyle, and Gwendolen, may be subjected to an alchemical process which will, in effect, render it into beneficent artifacts. Elsewhere in Jerusalem Los's alchemical furnaces issue forth liquid jewels that flow like silk (p. 244). The motif, along with its redemptive implica- tions, is perhaps most succinctly stated in Milton, when the returning form of the poet enters into the body of Blake: And all this Vegetative World appeard on my left Foot, As a bright sandal formd immortal of precious stones &amp; gold: I stopped down &amp; bound it on to walk forward thro' Eternity. (Milton, p. 114) The compression involved in the creation of this particular image is only slightly less remarkable than the strikingly original nature of the image itself. "The Vegetative World" becomes a jeweled sandal after Blake allows himself to incorporate the spirit of Milton. In order for artistic creation to proceed, then, the vegetative world, with its concomitant bounds of space, time, and the human body, must become a part of a greater spiritual process. Indeed, the legacy of art can only be transmitted from one generation to another through its visible or ob- jective correlative, here exemplified by the uniquely appropriate image of a jeweled sandal, one of Blake's equivalents for Keats's Grecian urn. Jewels are hidden in the raw matter of the vegeta- tive world, and these "sapphires in the mud," as T. S. Eliot would put it in the next century, must be uncovered and released from their shrouds of clay to be shaped and polished to their greatest translucence. In another sense, gems are the raw potentialities for art that exist within the spirit of every man. The sandal is first a physical necessity, a means of protecting the foot of the poet as he undertakes his redemptive journey; it is also an archetypal work of art, both a transmutation of natural matter and a means of aiding the natural body in its attempts to reach the spiritual center: Where the Human Harvest waves abundant in the beams of Eden Into a Rainbow of jewels and gold, . . . (Jerusalem, p. 195) If creation draws upon the gems that are con- cealed in the primal matter of the object world and refines them into their highest human form, so anticreation would reduce nature to a solid "rocky form" that binds the spirit in a monstrous artifact of repressiveness and death. Urizen- Albion will also "number" the fibers of the soul so that they may be spread out before the sun to dry like stalks of flax (p. 166). The natural source of heat and energy thus becomes an agent of separa- tion and petrifaction rather than a purgative agent of creation. At other points, natural force is "bonified" and natural forms fragmented by the knives of jealousy and revenge. In an interesting reversal of the matter-fire-jewel-art motif, in The Four Zoas a "once fair crystal form" can produce "serpents whose souls are flames of fire" when the forces of anticreation are dominant over the pow- ers of Los. The transmutation of nature into art is, of course, amenable to a spectrum of esthetic and psychological explanations, ranging from "art for art's sake" to a psychoanalytic theory of art as sublimation, or a social theory of art as the great civilizing agent to a more religiously grounded notion of art as eschatology. It is the particular genius of Blake that he touches upon a number of these possibilities at different points, particularly the Freudian idea of sublimating natural energy into esthetic form. Yet a modern reader must re- sist the danger of "reading back" into Blake's poetry any theory that would imply that Blake saw art as either therapy or, what is worse, mere decoration or self-indulgence. Just as the natural world invites a hierarchy of different responses, ranging from simple anthropomorphism to the capstone of artistic transmutation, so art itself reaches hierarchically toward a religious culmina- tion. If Blake was "romantic" in his exaltation of process, he was "medieval" in his implicit prefer- ence for a ladder of different ways in which artistic process could be utilized. At the peak of this par- ticular hierarchy, or esthetic chain of being, there is the identification between Los and Christ. All 130</page><page sequence="11">Barbara F. Lefcowitz things are "bound" into art, or rendered tangible, so that man might finally transcend his mortal state: Thus in a living Death the nameless shadow all things bound All mortal things made permanent that they may be put off Time after time by the Divine Lamb who died for all And all in him died. &amp; he put off all mortality (The Four Zoas, "Night the Eighth," p. 368; italics mine) The old divine analogy, where natural object pointed to spiritual correspondent, is thus shat- tered only to be reborn in a new guise, where natural objects are incorporated into the self and allowed to develop into new forms. Once having Notes 1 For readings of Blake that stress his antinaturalism, see P. Berger, William Blake: Poet and Mystic, trans. Daniel H. Conner (London: Chapman and Hall, 1914); S. Foster Damon, William Blafke: His Philosophy and Sym- bols (Boston and New York: Houghton, 1924); Milton 0. Percival. William Blake's Circle of Destiny (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1938); Hazard Adams, William Blake: A Readilng of the Shorter Poems (Seattle: Univ. of Washington Press, 1963). An excellent qualification of the "mystical" approach can be found in Helen White, The Mysticism of William Blake (Madison: Univ. of Wisconsin Press, 1927). 2 Citations from Blake in my text are from The Poetry and Prose of William Blake, ed. David Erdman (Garden City, N. Y.: Doubleday, 1968). 3 It may be argued that even mysticism does not neces- sarily repudiate objects outside the self, and that in a way it greatly enhances them. though at the price of their tangi- ble or sensuous reality. Richard Sterba comments in this context: "the basic element of the mystic experience is the loss of the constrictive frame over our Selves and the fusion with objects of the outside world-be they human or parts of the Cosmos or the universe as a whole," "Remarks on Mystic States," American Imago, 25 (1968), 81. 4 My precedent for using the nonchronological or the- matic organization comes from Adams, William Blake: A passed through the fires of the inner Los these forms may provide a bridge from the dying natural self to the eternal divine self. The drama may be similar to that of the physicotheological analo- gists, but the theater has now shifted from the natural world, which may or may not allude to other realms, to the theater of the inner self, which can contain, transmute, and transcend the objec- tive correlatives of the natural world. Yet even in Blake, perhaps the most inward of all poets prior to Coleridge and Shelley, the self can only push to full being against a rich and strong external reality. Anne Arundel Community College Arnold, Maryland Reading of the Shorter Poems. Adams justifies the method on grounds that the short lyrics are microcosms of Blake's larger myth, rather than simply parts of that myth (p. 28). In fairness, it should be noted that preference for the oppo- site, or chronological, method is expressed by Stanley Gardner, Infinity on the Anvil (Oxford: B. Blackwell, 1954), and E. D. Hirsch. Jr., Innocence and Experientce: An Intro- duction to Blake (New Haven, Conn.: Yale Univ. Press, 1964), both of whom favor the chronological approach in the context of their particular interests: the shifts in Blake's imagery and attitudes toward innocence and experience, respectively, as these were manifested over a longer period of time. Another good example of the historical method is David Erdman, Blake: Prophet against Empire (Princeton, N. J.: Princeton Univ. Press, 1954). 5 The Neo-Platonism of William Blake (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1961); William Blake: A Reading of the Shorter Poems (Seattle: Univ. of Washington Press, 1963). 6 For a discussion of the relevance of the Persephone- Kore myth to these poems, see Kathleen Raine, "Blake's Debt to Antiquity," Sewanee Review, 71 (1963), 325-450. 7 Northrop Frye, Fearful Symmetry (Toronto: Univ. of Toronto Press, 1947), pp. 356-403; Harold Bloom, Blake's Apocalypse (Garden City, N.
