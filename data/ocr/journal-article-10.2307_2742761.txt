G. T. Fechner deserves credit for the first official psychological treatment of "imagination images" in his Elemente der Psychophysik (1860), the textbook that initiated the modern experimental psychological era. Anathema in academic psy- chology during the regency of behaviorism from the 1920s to the early 1960s, mental imagery has in the last two decades become a prominent research focus (Holt 1964). Although psychologists are engaged in an intricate debate over the existence (e.g., Dennett 1981 [no], Fodor 1981 [yes]), definition (e.g., Bugelski 1971; Neisser 1972; A. Richardson 1977; J. Richardson 1980:25-42), and nature and effects (e.g., Pylyshyn 1973, 1978; Kosslyn and Pomerantz 1977; Finke 1980) of mental imagery in the context of experimental re- search, they have given no attention to the large body of evi- dence, primarily ethnographic and historical, on the "natural life" of mental imagery and its broader cultural significance.3 This lacuna in the literature may very well exist because, as one experimental psychologist notes, "contemporary psycholo- gists do not regard mental imagery as an interesting empirical phenomenon, but as a hypothetical entity whose existence must be proved in the course of experimental investigation" 3 Richardson 1980:14). The purpose of this introductory review is to explore the cultural role of mental imagery. If it can be assumed that mental imagery is "ubiquitous" (Doob 1972) and has probably been experienced by individuals in all cultures and in all eras of human history, then by examining its cross-cultural uses both 1 The inspiration for this paper grew out of many long and exciting discussions with Leonard George of the University of Western On- tario, who is always the "bearer of light." Norman E. Whitten, Jr., of the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign) read an earlier draft and provided some much appreciated criticism and encouragement. Jerome Bruner, Daniel Reisberg, and Veronique Foti of the New School for Social Research gave the fascinating seminar on mental imagery and mental representation that I attended in the spring of 1983 and for which the first draft was prepared. Suzzette Patterson of the University of Western Ontario provided assistance and warm en- couragement. Michael Harner of the New School for Social Research introduced me to the problems presented by shamanism and continues to be a source of encouragement and inspiration. My gratitude must again be expressed to him. A shorter treatment of the ideas contained in this paper was presented at the international conference entitled "Recent Developments in Research on Shamanism" at the Esalen In- stitute, Big Sur, Calif., in February 1984. 2 For an introduction to the psychological literature on mental imag- ery, see Segal (1971), Sheehan (1972), Block (1981), Sheikh (1982), and Yuille (1983). Pinker and Kosslyn's (1982) review of the theories of mental imagery is useful, as is Ernest's (1977) review of imagery ability and cognition. Mental imagery ability is considered "innate" for the reasons suggested by Doob (1972) and Kennedy (1983). Although it is recognized that there are different types of mental imagery (e.g., sen- sory, eidetic, memory, etc.), as noted by A. Richardson (1969), Neisser (1972), and Casey (1976), Richardson's (pp. 2-3) general definition of mental imagery will be used here: "(1) all those quasi-sensory or quasi- perceptual experiences of which (2) we are self-consciously aware, and which (3) exist for us in the absence of those stimulus conditions that are known to produce their genuine sensory or perceptual counter- parts, and which (4) may be expected to have different consequences from their sensory or perceptual counterparts." I Cronbach (1975:125) warns of the dangers of a "one-sided" ap- proach to complex problems such as mental imagery, an imbalance this paper intends to correct: "The two scientific disciplines, experi- mental control and systematic correlation, answer formal questions stated in advance. Intensive local observation goes beyond discipline to an open-eyed, open-minded appreciation of the surprises nature deposits in the investigative net. This kind of interpretation is histor- ical more than scientific. I suspect that if the psychologist were to read more widely in history, ethnology, and the centuries of humanistic writings on man and society, he would be better prepared for this part of the work." 443 RICHARD NOLL is a doctoral candidate in clinical psychology at the New School for Social Research in New York City (his mailing address: 206 Azalea, Stratford, N.J. 08084, U.S.A.). Born in 1959, he received his B.A. from the University of Arizona in 1979 and his M.A. from the New School in 1982. He is just completing a predoc- toral internship at Ancora Psychiatric Hospital in Hammonton, N.J., and at the Atlantic Mental Health Center in Atlantic City, N.J. His research interests include the phenomenology of shaman- ism, the cross-cultural utilization of altered states of consciousness and mental imagery, concepts of disease and healing, and primitive religion. He has published "Shamanism and Schizophrenia: A State-specific Approach to the 'Schizophrenia Metaphor of Sha- manic States" (American Ethnologist 10:443-59) and "Reply to Lex" (American Ethnologist 11:192). The present paper was sub- mitted in final form 1 xII 84. Vol. 26 No. 4 August-October 1985</page><page sequence="2">anthropologists and psychologists may find valuable clues for its further study. To limit the potentially immense scope of such a study, I place emphasis upon sources in the ethno- graphic and historical literatures that contain phenomenolog- ical data about mental imagery in traditional, nonliterate societies. However, pertinent references to the cultural role of mental imagery in Western civilization are included for the sake of interest and comparison. In particular, I wish to propose and develop an argument for the existence of a cultural phenomenon I call mental imagery cultivation in a wide variety of societies of varying complexity throughout cultural evolutionary history. By mental imagery cultivation I mean traditions devoted to the deliberate, re- peated induction of enhanced mental imagery, usually in select individuals. Mental imagery enhancement entails increasing the vividness and controlledness of mental imagery for its func- tional and adaptive value. Mental imagery is thus concep- tualized as an ability that can, allowing for individual differ- ences, be developed into a skill (see Katz 1983). I contend that mental imagery cultivation as a cultural phenomenon can be found in most cultures that we have knowledge of, including our own, and can be studied both diachronically and synchron- ically. By far the most common form of mental imagery culti- vation, and the focus of this review, is the enhancement of visual mental imagery experiences that are often referred to indigenously and by observers as "visions." A second major form, dream incubation,4 will not be explicated here, nor will the evidence for the cultivation of auditory imagery.5 The magico-medico-religious complexes in traditional, nonliterate societies collectively known as shamanism provide the best- documented example of vision cultivation and therefore will serve as a foundation for the further study of mental imagery cultivation as a cultural phenomenon. MENTAL IMAGERY: FROM THE SPONTANEOUS TO THE CULTIVATED From the phenomenological point of view, our everyday expe- rience of mental imagery is distinguished by its spontaneity. Sartre (1966[1940]) lists "spontaneity" as one of the essential characteristics of imagery. Adopting Kant's (1929[1787]:93) definition of spontaneity as "the mind's power of producing representations from itself," the phenomenological philosopher Casey (1976:68) describes imagining as an "autogenous" pro- cess, "one that begins of itself in the strict sense that it begins by itself, that is, through its own internal agency and not through external causation." For Casey, spontaneous imagina- tive acts are characterized by "effortlessness," "surprise," and "instantaneity," and spontaneous imaginative experience "'ArincPc cildl[AAIMv7 in laT%A7-k. ncvh 7 veI"nm {(?nPva 1 0'7k 14 AThek spontaneous experience of mental imagery in daily life most commonly takes place during our familiar stream of ordinary waking "personal consciousness" (James 1890, vol. 1:225) or in dreams, and, as the Mehinaku Indians of Brazil aptly put it, dreams especially "just 'come up' into a dreamer's awareness, 'like corn from the ground"' (Gregor 1981:711). Of interest here, however, are the more extraordinary re- ports, from a wide range of societies from the simplest to the most complex, of spontaneous "visions" during waking con- sciousness. These unsolicited imaginative experiences are gen- erally singled out for their vividness of visual mental imagery and for the cultural significance of their content.6 "The weird- ness of visions lies in their sudden appearance, in their vividness while present, and in their sudden departure" (Gal- ton 1883:168). In traditional, nonliterate societies the media- tion of visual mental imagery is essential for intercourse with the sacred, and direct contact with spirits, gods, etc., is espe- cially believed to be accomplished through dreams and visions. This universal belief in "primitive" societies has led an- thropologists from Tylor (1958[1871]) to La Barre (1970, 1972) to hypothesize that religion itself has its origin in the experience of visions and dreams.7 This idea was earlier expressed by Hobbes (1958[1651]:31): From this ignorance of how to distinguish dreams and other strong fancies from vision and sense did arise the greatest part of religion of the gentiles in the past that worshipped satyrs, fauns, nymphs, and the like, and nowadays the opinion that rude people have of faries, ghosts, and goblins and of the power of witches. In the historical literature of Western civilization, particu- larly that of medieval Europe, there are numerous reports of spontaneous visions, and, as in traditional societies, they are attributed religious significance. These visions are generally reported as "spontaneous" whether sought out deliberately or not, for to seek out such experiences was to be guilty of curiositas, the "passion for knowing unnecessary things (libido sciendi non necessaria)" (E. Peters 1978:xiv, 90), and thus risk excommunication. For example, Caesarius of Heisterbach compiled in his Dialogue on Miracles (Caesarius 1929 [1223]) a rich collection of reports of spontaneous visions and paranor- mal events by his monastic colleagues. The content of these visions reaffirmed consensual religious beliefs. Christian (1981) has assembled accounts of apparitions of the Virgin Mary and other saints in rural Spain drawn from verbatim testimony by common villagers between 1399 and 1523 and discussed the difficulties for the ecclesiastical authorities in distinguishing "true" from "false" visions, particularly in the case of Joan of Arc. Spontaneous visions are reported in the Bible (Bennett 1978) and in much of the hagiographic literature of the Middle Ages, and Kroll and Bachrach (1981) conclude that they were apparently not considered signs of psychopathology according to medieval standards of mental health. Thus, visions are by no means limited to "primitives" or psychotics,8 and a large ' Often the distinction between "dreams" and "visions" is not clear. "Dream incubation," as I use it here, refers to the deliberate induction and/or manipulation of mental imagery during REM sleep. The con- trol of the supernatural through dreams in simpler societies is discussed by D'Andrade (1961), and anthropological studies of dreams in these societies can be found in the works of Lincoln (1935), Eggan (1949), Seligman (1924, 1932), and Kilborne (1981). The ancient Greek dream incubation tradition connected with the temples of Asclepius is dis- cussed by Edelstein and Edelstein (1945), Meier (1966, 1967), and Ellenberger (1970:32-34). 5In his fascinating account of ancient Greek theurgy, Dodds (1951:292) notes that one of its two main branches was "concerned mainly with the consecrating . . . and animating of magic statues in order to obtain oracles from them." These oracles were transmitted to the diviner in auditory imagery. In his discussion of the vision quest in North America, Lowie (1937:272) observes: "As a matter of fact, 'vi- sions' are sometimes nothing of the sort but hallucinations of an audi- tory nature, or at least are associated with non-visual components. This is not a trivial point considering the incredible frequency of sa- cred, i.e., revealed, songs." 444 6 From the psychological point of view, mental imagery may be a crucial medium of "metaphoric predication" between domains (Fer- nandez 1974:133) and mental imagery cultivation the cultural tradition devised for the predication of sign images on inchoate pronomial sub- jects. 7 Tylor (1958[1871]:62) especially makes a passionate argument for this position: "Everyone who has seen visions while light-headed in fever, everyone who has ever dreamt a dream, has seen the phantoms of objects as well as of persons. How then can we charge the savage with far-fetched absurdity for taking into his philosophy and religion an opinion which rests on the very evidence of his senses?" 8 "Visions" are not necessarily pathognomonic. Galton (1883:176) insisted that "the visionary tendency is much more common among sane people than is generally suspected," and in the 19th century a burning issue among scholars was the verification of the "waking hal- lucinations of the sane" (e.g., Brierre de Boismont 1853; Galton 1881, 1883; Gurney, Myers, and Podmore 1886; Parish 1897). However, the ancient Romans referred to the genus irritabile vatum, the "irritable" CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">literature exists that chronicles the incidence of this basic hu- man experience in the West. If it can be assumed that these extraordinary spontaneous experiences of enhanced mental imagery have occurred in at least some individuals in all societies since earliest times, and if such experiences were deemed necessary as a medium for com- munication between men and extramundane agencies (a shared mundus imaginalis [Corbin 1972] in which sacred and profane meet), then it would not be surprising to find traditions for the deliberate, repeated "self-inducement" (Casey 1976:73) of enhanced mental imagery in some of these societies. As Dodds (1971:215) puts it, "From the belief that certain mental states are favorable to the emergence of supernormal phenom- ena it is logically a short step to the deliberate induction of these states. " The cultural cultivation of mental imagery, then, consists in taking the primary material or "raw stuff" of these spontaneous imaginative experiences and forging methods of reproducing such phenomena at will that can be taught to select others and even transmitted from generation to genera- tion. Although experimental psychology has not yet produced strong evidence for mental imagery enhancement "practice ef- fects,"9 Galton (1883:105) insisted that "there is abundant evi- dence that the visualising faculty admits of being developed by education." I propose that the existence of mental imagery cultivation as a cultural phenomenon vindicates Galton. In- deed, in many societies-particularly those in which shaman- ism exists-the cultivation of mental imagery may be consid- ered the experiential core of the indigenous magico-religious tradition. Perhaps the most important cultural role of mental imagery cultivation is to be found in this apparently strong link to magico-religious traditions. The importance of this link is often overlooked, mental imagery cultivation being mentioned pe- ripherally as a curiosity of ritual if at all. (Winkelman [1982], for example, notes that "visualization" is a characteristic of magical practice but does not elaborate.) Nonetheless, the rela- tionship between mental imagery cultivation and magico- religious traditions appears to hold regardless of societal com- plexity. THE CULTIVATION OF VISIONS IN SHAMANISM The most richly documented example of the cultural phenome- non of mental imagery cultivation can be found in the ethno- graphic literature on shamanism. Shamanism is an ecstatic healing tradition which at its core is concerned with the tech- niques for inducing, maintaining, and interpreting the experi- ence of enhanced visual mental imagery. The shaman is a powerful figure, for as a healer, mediator between the sacred and the profane, and mnemonic purveyor of culturally rele- vant material, he plays a role essential to the biological, spiri- tual, and cultural survival of his community. Shamanism in some form has appeared on all inhabited continents (Eliade 1964). In reviewing the ethnoaraDhic literature of shamanism, es- Noll: THE ROLE OF VISIONS IN SHAMANISM pecially that produced prior to 1975, it is difficult to find lucid, detailed reports of the use of visual mental imagery in shaman- ism. Indeed, no work is devoted solely to the explication of the functional and adaptive uses of mental imagery by the sha- man. Nonetheless, in obscure passages throughout the litera- ture anthropologists have pointed to the concern of shamanic techniques with the enhancement of visual mental imagery. "The original shamanism [of North Asia] does not consist, at least generally speaking, in possession, but rather in mere vi- sual phenomena" (Oesterreich 1935:305). Hultkrantz (1973:28) notes that "a shaman may seem to act in a lucid state when, in fact, his mind is occupied with interior visions." Benedict (1923:67) asserts that shamanism "is practically everywhere in some fashion or in some aspect built around the vision- guardian spirit complex" and elsewhere observes that North American Indian societies from coast to coast were preoc- cupied with the "inordinate pursuit of the vision" (Benedict 1922:1). Jilek (1982a:30-35) provides a valuable review of the obscure references to visionary experience among the Coast Salish of British Columbia. In her study of the Eskimos of St. Lawrence Island, Alaska, Murphy (1964:58) states in an early passage that "in a vision the would-be shaman acquired a 'spirit familiar' with which he would later become possessed during the curing rites," but she does not mention whether visual mental imagery was also a component of these later "possession trances." Anisimov (1963:86) exemplifies the Soviet literature's consistent pathological interpretation of sha- manic experience when he states that during ritual an Evenk shaman enters "a neurotic sleep accompanied by vivid dreams." Clearly, mental imagery is the "Ariadne thread" that can lead us through the labyrinthine literature of shamanism, providing us with as close an understanding of the experiences of the shaman as is possible. While visual mental imagery has been reported in shaman- ism, there has been little acknowledgment of the possibility that a central goal of shamanic training may be the develop- ment of visual mental imagery skills. Czaplicka (1969 [1914]:184, 189) comes close to this concept in mentioning the "mental training of the novice" and reporting that "among the Samoyed and Ostyak of the Turukhan country the future sha- man spends his youth in exercises which stimulate his nerves and excite his imagination," but the exact nature and purpose of these exercises are left unexplored. Recent hints of shamanic visionary training can be found in the work of Siikala (1978:191) and to some extent in that of Elkin (1977[1945]:49), Reichel-Dolmatoff (1975), and L. G. Peters (1982). Harner's (1980) valuable phenomenological presentation offers impor- tant insights into the psychological variables manipulated dur- ing the training of the novice shaman. I propose that shamanic training in vision cultivation is a two-phase process. First, the neophyte shaman is trained to increase the vividness of his visual mental imagery through various psychological and physiological techniques. The pur- pose is to block out the noise produced by the external stimuli of perception and to attend to internal imagery processes, thus bringing them more clearly into focus. Fechner described this process in 1860 when he said that "in imagining, the attention feels as if drawn backwards towards the brain" (cited in James 1890, vol. 2:50). Research has demonstrated that "imagery functions as an internal signal which is confused with the ex- ternal signal" (Segal and Fusella 1970:458), and thus the first phase of shamanic vision cultivation is to induce a cognitive figure-ground reversal by increasing the vividness of mental imagery until it is attended to as primary experience (figure) and diminishing the vividness of percepts until they are at- tended to as secondary experience (ground). Once the novice shaman can report more vivid imagery experiences, a second phase of shamanic mental imagery training is aimed at increas- 445 or "emotionally labile" race of seers, and a similar prejudice exists in the psychopathological interpretation of shamanism (Kroeber 1940; Devereux 1956, 1961, 1980; Silverman 1967; La Barre 1970, 1972). This "schizophrenia metaphor" of shamanic experience is unfounded (see Noll 1983, 1984). 9 Only four studies utilizing mental imagery enhancement training appear in the psychological literature: two based on a "bio- informational theory of emotional imagery" (Lang 1979, Lang et al. 1983) and two parapsychological studies (George 1982, Braud 1983). Lang's work is the most promising. However, many other scholars have expressed the optimism of Marks (1972:98), who asserts that "given appropriate and optimal conditions of training and perfor- mance it is likely that all persons could utilize imagery-encoded infor- mation. " Vol. 26 No. 4 August-October 1985</page><page sequence="4">ing the controlledness of the experienced visual imagery con- tents, actively engaging and manipulating the visionary phe- nomena. These two phases are not necessarily discrete; increase in control over visual mental imagery may be sought concurrently with an increase in its vividness. The distinction between them is, however, useful in interpreting the phenomenological data of shamanic accounts. "Vividness" and "controlledness" are, furthermore, the two imagery parameters most commonly examined in the experimental literature of psy- chology. INCREASING THE VIVIDNESS OF MENTAL IMAGERY Attribution of "vividness" to mental imagery is a metaphor borrowed from perceptual experience, thus suggesting the phenomenological similarity of mental imagery with percep- tual events. "By 'vividness' we mean a combination of clarity and liveliness. The more vivid an image, therefore, the closer it approximates an actual percept" (Marks 1972:83). Whether mental imagery is continuous or discontinuous with perception is an ancient question. Casey (1976:127-32) provides a brief overview of the relationship between "imagination" and "per- ception" in the history of Western philosophy, starting with the initial dichotomy presented by Aristotle (continuity) and Plato (discontinuity). Casey himself argues for the discontinuity of imagination and perception, asserting that "even if imagining relies on perceiving is regarded as a premise of all human experience, it remains master in its own house, displaying as autonomous action that is without parallel in perception" (p. 173). A comprehensive review of the recent experimental work on mental imagery by Finke (1980) adds support to the continuity hypothesis. Finke argues (p. 113) that there are "specific levels of information processing within the visual system at which mental images and physical objects and events are functionally equivalent, as revealed by their perceptual and behavioral ef- fects." Furthermore, he argues that "mental images, once formed," activate "many of the same information-processing mechanisms that are activated during visual perception" (p. 130): IO According to this view, mental images can stimulate visual processing mechanisms directly. Thus, when mental images are formed, these mechanisms would respond in much the same way as they do when objects and events are observed, resulting in the sensation that an image can be "seen" as if it were an actual object or event. Further, the more vivid the image, the more strongly these mechanisms would respond, and the more similar to actual objects or events the mental image would appear. Finke's "levels of equivalence" theory has profound conse- quences for our understanding of shamanism. Performing specific techniques to enhance the vividness of mental imagery activates "unconscious" (Shevrin and Dickman 1980), nonvoli- tional levels of the psychophysiological apparatus in response to the imagery; thus the shaman increases the affective accep- tance of visionary experiences as ontologically distinct phe- nomena. In other words, the shaman fully accepts "visions" as valid experiences and reacts on a deep psychophysiological level to their contents. This accounts for the perception-like quality of the verbal reports of visionary experience, especially the vibrant, affectively charged first-person accounts of shamans. The shaman "exists in two worlds," says Hultkrantz (1973:31), and acknowledges the validity of both, his mastery deriving from his ability not to confuse the two. "What is real for me is not real for you," a Washo shaman tells Handelman (1967:457). Swanson (1973:360) observes that in the vision quest for a guardian spirit in North America, "a vision was taken to be a real perception: an encounter with an order of reality independent of the perceiver. " Therefore, an increase in the vividness of the shaman's visual mental imagery is concom- itant with psychophysiological changes which increase the sub- jective feeling that the "hallucinatory sphere" (Reichel- Dolmatoff 1975:xvii) or the "hidden world" (Harner 1972:134- 69) of shamanic societies is "real.""1 This new evidence provided by the experimental investiga- tion of mental imagery sharply differs with the generally im- plicit assumption that the subjective experience of the shaman is merely "fancy" or a product of psychopathology (see Noll 1983). The conception of shamanism as an "experiencing of 'the Unreal' " (Norland 1967) is characteristic of the Soviet literature, which does not consider the application of psycho- logical data in ethnographic analysis. 12 Perhaps future treat- ments of shamanism will be more sensitive to the importance of the psychophysiological variables manipulated in the mental imagery experiences of the shaman. Another important insight comes from Finke's (1980:122- 24) assessment of the experimental data on measuring visual acuity for mental images. In further support of the continuity hypothesis, he concludes that there is "strong evidence that functional equivalencies between mental images and physical objects exist at levels of the visual system where constraints are placed on acuity in the peripheral visual field" (p. 123). In essence, this startling conclusion purports that the "mind's eye" has a fovea, i.e., that central aspects of the mental image will be in sharper focus than peripheral ones. Not surprisingly, increasing the clarity of the shaman's mental imagery is cited as a goal of shamanic visionary training. Increasing the vividness of mental imagery through training sharpens the focus to the perception-like quality. In his study of the Tamang shamanism of Nepal, L. G. Peters (1982:34) briefly notes that the progression of the shaman's visionary training is one of transforming "crude visions" into "clear visions." Similarly, among the Tukano of Colombia, Reichel-Dolmatoff (1975:77) reports that it is important that the shaman (pay6) be able to have clear and meaningful hallucinations.... His vision must not be blurred, his sense of hearing must be acute, that is, he must be able to distinguish clearly the images that appear to his mind while in a state of trance, and to understand the supernatural voices speaking to him. Much of this capacity is, undoubtedly, acquired over the years, the paye developing his own key of interpretation, but some of it is said to be already discernible at an early age. A common metaphor for the enhanced vividness of mental imagery through training is the transformation of the shaman's eyes or the development of an "inner" or "spiritual eye." The indigenous use of this metaphor in shamanic cultures adds further anecdotal support to the apparent functional equiva- lence of imagery and perception. Among the Australian Aborigines mental imagery training involves the development of the "strong eye." Elkin (1977[1945]:49) remarks that "an important faculty which the 'clever men' possess and which is assiduously trained, is the 'strong eye'. . . . to possess the 'strong eye' is to have the faculty of seeing spirits, of the living and of the dead." In the initiatory vision of a Nganasan Samoyed shaman of Siberia, a "blacksmith" dismembered him and also "changed his eyes; and that is why, when he 10 Summarizing his and colleagues' studies of the formation of visual images, Shepard (1978:135) arrives at a point close to Finke's conclu- sion when he states that imaginal or analogical thinking is "a process in which the intermediate internal states have a natural one-to-one corre- spondence to appropriate intermediate states in the external world." 446 The affective basis of our sense of "reality" is described by James (1890, vol. 1:283): "In its inner nature, belief, or the sense of reality, is a sort offeeling more allied to the emotions than anything else." Hume (1961[1748]:340) also acknowledged the baseline importance of affect in distinguishing between fiction and belief. 12 I am indebted to Mihaly Hoppal of the Ethnographic Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences for explicating this dichotomy between "ethnology" and "psychology" in the Soviet literature.</page><page sequence="5">/nllb TT-TF ROTE OF VTSTONS TN SHTAMANTSM shamanizes, he does not see with his bodily eyes but with these mystical eyes" (Siikala 1978:184). Bogoras (1909:116) reports in his classic The Chuckchee, "The eyes of the shaman have a look different from that of other people, and they explain it by the assertion that the eyes of the shaman are very bright (nikeragen), which, by the way, gives them the ability to see 'spirits' in the dark." These accounts strongly suggest that increasing the vividness of mental imagery is part of the training of the novice shaman. What now needs to be explored is how this is accom- plished. Altered states of consciousness. The most common and cer- tainly the most effective method employed by shamans for increasing the vividness of visual mental imagery is the delib- erate induction of altered states of consciousness. 13 The use of altered states of consciousness is central to many definitions of shamanic practice (Czaplicka 1969[1914]:198; Maddox 1923: 44; Shirokogoroff 1935:275, 362-66; Oesterreich 1935:295; Eliade 1964:4; Firth 1964; Lewis 1971:92-93; Reinhard 1976:16; Siikala 1978:15; Harner 1980:20; Peters and Price- Williams 1980:408; Noll 1983:444-46). The ability to experience altered states of consciousness is universal in the species. Weil (1972:17) goes so far as to suggest that the "desire to alter consciousness periodically is an innate normal drive analogous to hunger or the sexual drive." Bour- guignon (1974:234) has described altered states of conscious- ness as providing the "raw materials for potential cultural utili- zation." Vivid mental imagery may certainly be considered a potent example of these "raw materials." Bourguignon (1968, 1973) found that fully 90% of a sample of 488 world societies of varying complexity had some form of institutionalized altered states of consciousness. These altered states were found to fall into two main clusters: "possession trance," including states indigenously interpreted as due to possession by an exogenous agency that "[do] not involve hallucinations" (Bourguignon 1973:12), and "trances" including altered states not so inter- preted but generally characterized by enhanced visual mental imagery. Shamanism is concerned primarily with the cultiva- tion of the latter, which has also been termed "magical flight" (Eliade 1964) or the "shamanic state of consciousness" (Harner 1980, Noll 1983). While the repertoire of the shaman may include other altered states of consciousness, such as revelatory dreams or states interpreted as "spirit possession" or "posses- sion trance," the mastery of visionary states is essential. Whereas most scholars of shamanism center on the shaman's "ecstasy" or altered state of consciousness as the goal of the shaman's rite technique (e.g., Siikala 1978), I contend that the shaman's goal is enhanced mental imagery and the induction of an altered state of consciousness is a means to that end. Indeed, the important point stressed by the study of shamanism as a form of mental imagery cultivation is not that consciousness is altered but that mental imagery is enhanced. Furthermore, mental imagery is enhanced in order to serve specific functions for which it has a unique adaptive value. Thus, the adaptive and functional significance of mental imagery is stressed, not merely the fact that it is a concomitant of a large generic group of altered states. Mental imagery is intensified through ritual procedures for inducing altered states of consciousness that manipulate both physiological and psychological variables. As Shirokogoroff (1935:324) observes, there are a "great number of methods of producing extasy [sic]," and Jilek (1982b:335-39) has sum- marized the most salient ones to be found in shamanism.14 Maddox (1923:44) reports that " 'trance' and 'ecstasy' are two aids of the medicine man" and that "in ecstasy there is a certain want of muscular control,.and the mind is actively employed in seeing visions." In "The Vision in Plains Culture," Benedict (1922:1) states that a common cross-cultural approach to in- ducing visions was through "isolation and self-mortification." Similarly, Galton (1883:174) remarks that "the spiritual disci- pline undergone for purposes of self-control and self- mortification have also the incidental effect of producing vi- sions. . . . they often, through error, receive a religious sanction. This is notably the case among half-civilized races." Although a great deal of emphasis has been placed on the more exotic procedures for inducing altered states of conscious- ness, much simpler techniques for enhancing the vividness of mental imagery have been reported. All of them have in com- mon the goal of blocking out the noise produced by the external stimuli of visual perception. Thus Shirokogoroff (1935:325) ob- serves that "shamanistic performances are usually carried out in the dark." Shamanic costume paraphernalia also are specifically designed to enhance the production of visual men- tal imagery. Prokofyeva (1963:124) reports the "blindfolding" of the Selkup shaman, which is "explained by the investigators as being conducive to concentration by the shaman." "The Samoyed tadibey substitute for the mask a handkerchief tied over the eyes, so that they can penetrate into the spirit world by their innersight" (Czaplicka 1969[1914]:203). The Central Eskimo shaman "gets his visions sitting or lying in deep con- centration at the back of the sleeping platform, behind a cur- tain, or covered with a skin. The drum is not used in this connection" (Holtved 1967:46). An interesting description of an old Australian Aborigine shaman practicing his visual men- tal imagery enhancement techniques is provided by one of El- kin's (1977[1945]:56) Aboriginal informants: When you see an old man sitting by himself over here in the camp, do not disturb him, for if you do he will "growl" at you. Do not play near him, because he is sitting down by himself with his thoughts in order "to see." He is gathering his thoughts so that he can feel and hear. Perhaps he then lies down, getting into a special posture, so that he may "see" when sleeping. He sees indistinct visions, and hears "per- sons" talk in them. He gets up and looks for those he has "seen," but not seeing them, he lies down again in the prescribed manner, so as to see what he had not "seen" before. He puts his head on the pillow as previously so as to "see" (have a vision) as before. Getting up, he tells his friends to strengthen that power (miwi) within them, so that when they lie down they will see and feel (or become aware of) people not present, and in that way they will perceive them. Imaginal conditioning. An operant-conditioning-based mental imagery enhancement training program devised by Lang (1979; Lang et al. 1983) to test his "bio-informational theory of emotional imagery" may provide some valuable clues to understanding the training of the novice shaman. In his elegant psychophysiological studies of imagery based on Pyly- shyn's (1973) propositional theory, particular response descrip- tions of the subjects' experienced imagery are systematically reinforced by the experimenter. This "response training," says Lang (1979:506), "appears to act like an amplifier, increasing the magnitude of those responses which are part of an affective reaction to which the subject is already predisposed." He de- scribes his procedures as follows (p. 503): Subjects were presented with sample scripts, containing response propositions, and asked to imagine the scenes suggested by the text. Following each imagining, the experimenter asked them to report what they had actually imagined. The trainer reacted to these descrip- tions by systematically reinforcing all statements which indicated that 13 Tart (1975:208) defines "altered state of consciousness" as a "qual- itative alteration in the overall patterning of mental functioning, such that the experiencer feels his consciousness is radically different from the way it functions ordinarily." 14 He identifies the following techniques: focused suggestive atten- tion, pain stimulation, hypoglycemia and dehydration, forced hyper- motility, temperature stimulation, acoustic stimulation, seclusion and Vol. 26 * No. 4 * August-October 1985 restricted mobility, visual-sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation, ki- netic stimulation, and hyperventilation. To this list must be added the ingestion of hallucinogens (Furst 1972, Harner 1973a). 447</page><page sequence="6">the subject experienced himself behaving during imagery. Typical reinforced responses were "my muscles were tense," "I felt myself running," "my heart was racing," "I was gasping for breath," etc. Stimulus description was ignored by the trainer. Over trials subjects progressively increased reports of responding in their imagery and in the reported vividness of an imagined behavioral experience. We also developed a second training program, based on the counter hypothesis, that vivid imagery is characterized by the number, clarity, and specificity of stimulus elements in the image. In this "mind's eye" training, subjects were reinforced for reports of the color, form, and pictorial vividness of things apprehended. The trainer pressed for more and more detailed content, while he ignored any reports of sub- ject behavior in the scenes. These subjects also progressed under train- ing, and soon came to report rich tapestries of sense impression during imagery. He concludes (p. 506) that his results "suggest that response training has the effect of causing average subjects to respond to imagery instructions in a way which is similar to that of sub- jects who have been selected, through questionnaire or percep- tual recall tests, for their inherent imagery ability." Although Lang's work needs replication, I propose that some form of imaginal "response training" or stimulus training is an essential aspect of the training of the novice shaman by the master shamans. Both behavioral and pictorial elements (color, form, etc.) are probably systematically reinforced by the master shamans as the novice progressively increases the vividness of his visual mental imagery through training. As- suming that humans are essentially pragmatic and will, through trial and error, hit upon methods that "work" to achieve desired goals, it is not unreasonable to conjecture that a form of imaginal conditioning was instrumental in shamanic vision cultivation. The clearest phenomenological report of such imaginal conditioning in the literature is Reichel- Dolmatoff's (1975:79) account of the mental imagery enhance- ment training of a Tukano shaman: The quest for these power objects is difficult and slow. For nights on end the men will sit and chant, asking thunder to favor them with his power. Until, in their trance, they will see a tree, a piece of wood, or a stone and will suddenly know: this is mine, this is what thunder sent me! The drugged apprentice will mumble and groan in his trance. Close by, the paye is sitting. "What do you see? Tell me, what do you see?" he will ask insistently, and the apprentice will then find the words to describe his visions. "There is the bend in the river . . . a black rock ... I can hear the water rushing...." "Go on, go on!" the paye will insist, his ear close to the other's mouth. "There are birds, red birds, sitting on the lower branches of the tree...." "Are they sitting on your left or on your right?" the paye will ask. And so they continue, haltingly, at times in deep silence, until the older man knows what kind of images and voices his pupil is perceiving and can now begin to interpret for him. INCREASING THE CONTROLLEDNESS OF MENTAL IMAGERY The "controllability" of mental imagery-"the extent to which a person can evoke and change images at will" (Tower and Singer 1981:131)-is a second important dimension of mental imagery examined in the literature (see, e.g., Gordon 1949; A. Richardson 1972; White, Sheehan, and Ashton 1977). The ability to control imagery has been positively correlated with a variety of variables, e.g., the frequency of dream recall (His- cock and Cohen 1973) and the successful mental rehearsal of a motor skill. An important cross-cultural characteristic of the vision cultivation process is the development of relative control over "the initiation, the guidance, and the termination of the imaginative act-cum-presentation" (Casey 1976:73). Casey considers the "eidetic traits" of controlledness and spontaneity mutually exclusive but complementary. The controlledness of the shaman's mental imagery can only be relative because the spontaneity of the imaginal contents with which the shaman must actively engage is a dominant characteristic of shamanic accounts. Shamans report being surprised and challenged by the unexpected appearance of 448 torces or agencies (spirits, uemons, gocs, etc.) tnat must De reacted to and actively engaged with while in the visionary state (see, e.g., the tone of the accounts included in the collec- tion by Halifax 1979). "Potentially, all of imaginative experi- ence is controllable. Actually in a given case only certain as- pects will be controlled" (Casey 1976:64). The hallmark of the shaman is the ability to control his visions-to begin, manipulate, and end them at will. Accord- ing to L. G. Peters (1982:35), The training appears to have the purpose of creating a specific intro- spective state, one in which the neophyte learns to enter volitionally into a visionary state where he is participant, observer, and controller. While the shaman organismically participates in his visions, even to the extent of occasionally miming some of his encounters, he is able to stand back, so to speak, and manipulate his visions' contents. Spirit mastery. Definitions of shamanism generally cast "spirit mastery" in a central role (Shirokogoroff 1935:271; Ohlmarks 1939:353; Eliade 1964:93; Firth 1967:296; Lewis 1971:51; Landy 1977:417; Siikala 1978:334; Harner 1980:20; Noll 1983:444-45). 15 Spirit mastery may be viewed as an attempt to increase the controlledness of the contents of the shaman's en- hanced mental imagery. I define spirit mastery as contact with and manipulation of spirits. Following the two-phase schema for the mental imagery enhancement process, contact with spirits can be viewed from a psychological point of view as an increase in the vividness of mental imagery, while the manipu- lation of spirits can be described as an increase in the con- trolledness of mental imagery. Thus, spontaneously "seeing spirits" may be the first step towards "mastering" them later through mental imagery enhancement practice. Increasing control over mental imagery is mirrored in the developing shaman's increasing number of mastered spirits. Shirokogoroff (1935:271) notes that "the shaman at the begin- ning of his career usually does not have very many spirits, but he masters them gradually." An increase in the controlledness of mental imagery is also reflected in the increasing number of structural characteristics of mental imagery that the shaman can master. Imaginal conditioning plays an important part in the training of controlledness. Another illuminating passage from Reichel-Dolmatoff (1975:97-98) describes the concomit- tant increase in vividness and controlledness in the mental imagery practice of Tukano shamans: 15 Shirokogoroff's (1935:269) description of the shaman in Siberia can be applied cross-culturally: "persons of both sexes who have mas- tered spirits, who at will can introduce these spirits into themselves and use their power over the spirits in their own interests, particularly helping other people, who suffer from the spirits; in such a capacity they may possess a complex of special methods for dealing with the spirits." A Western European visionary tradition of spirit mastery was medieval and Renaissance ritual magic. Butler (1949:3) reports that ritual magic "aimed principally at control of the spirit world," and spirit mastery was obtained in a state of enhanced visual mental imag- ery induced by the elaborate rituals of conjuration or invocation of "spirits," "apparitions," or "demons." Our familiar figure of Faust, standing within the protection of his magic circle, adorned in a robe covered with apotropaic symbols to keep the conjured entity beyond the circle, a book of spells in one hand and a sword or magic wand in the other, is based on the ritual magician or magus. According to medieval and Renaissance sources, the most powerful tool of the ma- gus was the vis imaginativa or "power of the imagination." In a 13th- century discussion of the visions of magicians, St. Thomas Aquinas (1956[ca. 1258-64]:91) reveals that "through these visions or auditory messages which appear in the performances of magicians, intellectual knowledge of things which surpass the capacity of his understanding often come to a person. Examples are the revealing of hidden trea- sures, the showing of future events, and sometimes true answers are given concerning scientific demonstrations." The similarities between the vision cultivation of the shaman and that of the magus are striking. For example, shamans enter a visionary state to consult spirits- sometimes of the dead-for divinatory purposes; a similar mental im- agery exercise by the medieval magus was called necromancy and was a crime punishable by death. CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">At about midmorning each man drinks three small cups of this yaje, all the time singing and smoking, and after a while the paye will ask his companions: "What do you see?" The first visions are blurred; it is like smoke arising from nowhere, ascending slowly like a wall before their eyes. They now take their snuffing tubes and absorb the vih6 mixture. Lying in their hammocks they now feel that they are ascending to the Milky Way. . . . The ascent to the Milky Way is not easily accom- plished. An apprentice will hardly ever be able to rise immediately to this superluminary region but, rather, will learn to do so only after many trials. At first he will barely rise over the horizon; the next time, perhaps, he will reach a point corresponding to the position of the sun at 9 A.M., then at 10 A.M., and so on, until at last, in a single soaring flight, he will rise to the zenith. The shaman masters spirits for didactic reasons as well. "During the period of initial contacts the spirits function above all as teachers" (Siikala 1978:228). Jochelson (1905:47) met two Koryak shamans who reported that, while in solitude, "the spirits appear to them in visible form, endow them with power, and instruct them." The shaman is a specialist whose expertise derives from the unique contact with and manipulation of forces or agencies, experienced in visions as autonomous or semiautonomous, which generally cannot be contacted and manipulated in his ordinary state of waking consciousness. Culturally, whether these are interpreted as exogenous forces or agencies exhibiting a certain "intentionality" (such as spirits or gods) or as endoge- nous ones such as nonanthropomorphized sources of occult power that reside within the shaman's body (e.g., the healing energy n/um of the Kalahari Kung [Katz 1982]), they are all experienced from the perspective of the shaman as originating from outside him. To the shaman, the experience of "spirits" is in every sense of the word "real." To the "cognicentrist" (see Harner 1980:xiv; Noll 1983:447-50) observer, such experi- ences can be reduced to explanations that account for their phenomenology but not their ontology. THE FUNCTIONAL AND ADAPTIVE CULTURAL ROLES OF MENTAL IMAGERY DIFFERENCES IN MENTAL IMAGERY ABILITY AND SOCIAL ROLE That there are individual differences in the ability to experi- ence mental imagery was proposed by Galton (1880, 1883). Similarly, James (1890, vol. 2:57) notes that "a person whose visual imagination is strong finds it hard to understand how those who are without the faculty can think at all. Some people undoubtedly have no visual images at all worthy of the name." This difference between vivid imagers and others continues to be explored experimentally (J. Richardson 1980:117-42; Tower and Singer 1981:124-29). Not just any individual can become a shaman. Since the essence of shamanism is vision cultivation, individuals who report experiences of enhanced visual mental imagery are more likely to be singled out for shamanic training. This strongly suggests that individual differences in the ability to experience mental imagery may be a major determinant of social role. Often a youth's spontaneous visions of "spirits" are a sign of a shamanic vocation (e.g., Harner 1972:224n; Eliade 1964:84; Siikala 1978:189). Shirokogoroff (1935:274), discussing the "adaptive instability of individuals and groups," remarks that the ecstasy of the shamanic candidate "cannot be created with- out a certain individual instability," and I have pointed to a lability that marks individuals as candidates for shamanic training (1983:446). The nascent shaman may be characterized by what has been called the "fantasy-prone personality. " Wilson and Barber (1981, 1982) compiled a profile from the intensive study of excellent hypnotic subjects and concluded that "fantasy-prone Vol. 26 *No. 4 *August-October 1985 Noll: THE ROLE OF VISIONS IN SHAMANISM personalities" may comprise 4% of the population. These are persons who "fantasize a large part of the time, who typically 'see,' 'hear,' 'smell,' 'touch,' and fully experience what they fantasize" (Wilson and Barber 1982:340). As is the case with the descriptions of young shamans-to-be, "their extensive and deep involvement in fantasy seems to be their basic character- istic," and Wilson and Barber list the following talents of fan- tasy-prone personalities as derivatives of their intense fantasy life: "their ability to hallucinate voluntarily, their superb hyp- notic performances, their vivid memories of their life experi- ences, and their talents as psychics or sensitives." What is striking about this list is that these are all commonly reported attributes of shamans in traditional, nonliterate societies. The ability to experience mental imagery vividly is a mark of preferred status in some cultures. In our own culture there is evidence that reporting the experience of vivid mental imagery is socially desirable and that this "social desirability" factor is a confounding variable to be controlled for in the use and inter- pretation of self-report measures of imagery and imagination (White, Sheehan, and Ashton 1977). Lowie (1925:12) reports that he found individual differences that allowed some Crow to experience visions more easily than others and concludes that "we must assume that some people experience visions because of temperamental disposition, which their envious copyists lack." Such experiences may lead to "ceremonial prominence and wealth" (Lowie 1925:5). However, the exact nature of the "temperamental predisposition" of the "vatic personality" (La Barre 1972) that accounts for individual differences in mental imagery remains a mystery. IMAGERY MNEMONICS AND THE PRESERVATION OF CULTURE A universal feature of shamanism is the "magical flight" (Eliade 1964) or the "shamanic journey" (Harner 1980) of the shaman's "soul" that takes place during his visions. "Healer and psychopomp, the shaman is there because his soul can safely abandon his body and roam at vast distances, can pene- trate the underworld and rise to the sky" (Eliade 1964:182). What is often understated in discussions of nonliterate societies by modern observers is that the cultural mythology is a living one. There are no written sources to validate religious beliefs, only the repeated, ritualized, reexperiencing of the sacred. Through the enhancement of his visual mental imagery the shaman can "travel" to other realms, perform vital tasks for himself and his community, and then safely "return" and relate his adventures to his audience. This activity performs a crucial didactic and especially mnemonic function. In the visionary journeys of shamans, a universal character- istic is the travel of the shaman's "soul" to different "levels" or "worlds," each with its stereotypical set of culturally pre- scribed supramundane experiences. For example, in noting the "high degree of control" that the Tamang shaman Bhirendra had over his visions, L. G. Peters (1981:107) remarks that, "for the most part, they [the visions] were stereotyped. He traveled to specific heavens, encountered specific deities, and under- went similar experiences depending on the nature of the ritual he was performing." The number of "levels" the shaman must ascend or descend (the two most common orienting metaphors found in these accounts) is of course determined by the mythol- ogy of the particular culture, but Eliade (1964:259-87) argues that the "essential schema" of visionary travel to at least 3 levels or "cosmic zones" (sky, earth, and underworld) along a central axis of some sort (e.g., tunnel, tree, mountain) is ubiq- uitous. However, in Siberia, 7, 9, 16, 17, or even 33 are not uncommon (Eliade 1964:275; Vasilevich 1963). One possible explanation for the universality of this schema is that it mimics one of the fundamental facts of the organiza- 449</page><page sequence="8">tional processes of memory. In nonliterate societies large amounts of cultural information must be memorized and con- tinually rehearsed. Retention of this information will depend on how well the material is organized. The importance of or- ganizational strategies in memory was strikingly demonstrated by the experimental studies of the Gestalt psychologists (Katona 1940; Koffka 1935:423-528; Kohler 1947:279-319) and Bartlett (1932) and continues to be supported by contem- porary cognitive psychologists (see Tulving and Donaldson 1972). As Cole and Gay (1972:1068) point out, "there is good reason to expect members of a pre-literate, traditional society to have developed mnemonic skills different from those of liter- ate, technological societies." I contend that the most salient mnemonic strategies employed in nonliterate societies are based on the use of mental imagery. Recent research has dem- onstrated that mental imagery plays a key organizational role in memory. Neisser (1972:243) asserts that "we cannot help noticing that visual representation is among the most common and the most powerful of the [mnemonic] strategies used" (see also Neisser 1982). Indeed, in his comprehensive review of the experimental evidence linking mental imagery and human memory J. T. E. Richardson (1980:82) concludes that "under laboratory conditions instructions to use mental imagery may lead to substantial improvements in memory performance.... these effects come about by means of increased organisation of the material to be remembered." I further argue that the shaman's visionary "travels" to vari- ous "levels," each pregnant with specifically organized cultural meanings, operates as an imagery mnemonic for the retention of mythological beliefs and other culturally relevant materials in a nonliterate society. Siikala (1978:191) reports that an im- portant professional skill developed early in the training of the novice shaman is "the transfer of tradition and above all its internalization in visions." Each individual journey that a sha- man embarks upon equally serves as a collective rehearsal of cultural memories. 16 The visionary journey of the shaman to various levels is analogous to following a "cognitive map" (Neisser 1976:108- 53; Casson 1983:444-46) similar to the mnemonic "method of loci" invented by Greek orators to retain large amounts of information in memory (see Yates 1966). "In this method, one establishes a cognitive map of a series of particular locations or places, which one can mentally 'visit' in a particular order. Given any arbitrary list of items to memorize, it is only neces- sary to imagine each deposited on a particular location; near- perfect recall will follow if one then 'revisits' the places in the usual order" (Neisser 1972:243). Just as the ancient Greeks memorized sizable blocks of their orations by associatively or- ganizing them along a path of consecutive loci in their im- mediate environment, so do shamans retain and review their culture's cosmology by journeying to successive "levels" in their visions. This use of orientation schemata by "primitives" was similarly commented upon by Galton (1883:103), who wrote that "the Eskimos are geographers by instinct, and ap- pear to see vast tracts of country mapped out in their heads." Siikala (1978:186) strikingly illustrates the importance of cogni- tive maps in shamanism in her analysis of the initiatory vision of a Nganasan Samoyed shaman: To be able to operate in the other world the shaman must be familiar with its topography and the roads crossing it. The guide repeatedly impresses on the novice the importance of knowing the roads and paths of various spirit beings. The reference to the way of another shaman, which the shaman may not use, is interesting. Every shaman would thus have his own ways, which he followed from landmarks. The tents of various spirit beings act in themselves as signposts, for they are all different, and special attention is drawn in the vision to their outer form and associated symbolism. The shaman's mastery of mental imagery is an important asset in his cultural role as mythological mnemonist. Eliade (1958: 102) lauds the "outstanding role of memory" in shamanism, for in nonliterate societies "the shaman is the man who knows and remembers." L. G. Peters (1981:62) relates a Tamang myth that explains why the shamanic bombo tradition, represented by Nara Bon Chen, the first human shaman, is memorized and maintained orally, whereas the "inferior" lama tradition of Guru Rinpoche (Padma Sambhava) must rely upon texts: One day Guru Rinpoche set out to fool Nara and cause him to lose some of his powers. So he bragged that he had burned all his books because he knew everything and no longer needed them. Not wanting to be shown up, Nara threw his books into a fire. When they were aflame, Guru Rinpoche reached into his jacket to reveal his texts, and laughed at Nara for being so stupid. Nara reached into the fire and ate all the ashes, saying "I am as powerful as you, but I do not need texts for I have committed everything to memory." This tale demonstrates the respect accorded the shaman's superior powers of memory by his community. It is the sha- man's responsibility to remember for the others. The shaman may have a superior memory because of his superior use of mental imagery skills. If this conclusion is valid, then it forcefully illustrates the adaptive value of mental imagery. Mental imagery cultivation in nonliterate societies may perhaps best be viewed from the cultural evolutionary standpoint as an adaptive mechanism for the survival of cul- ture. MENTAL IMAGERY IN HEALING AND DIVINATION As I have pointed out, an important cultural role of mental imagery cultivation is to be found in its strong association with magico-religious traditions. In primitive societies, as well as in the West in classical times (see Dodds 1951, 1971), two inex- tricably related functions of magico-religious traditions are healing and divination. What is often overlooked is the use of enhanced visual mental imagery in the performance of these functions. Just as the Greek god Apollo and his son Asclepius were physicians and seers (Meier 1967:32), the shaman uses visual mental imagery to diagnose and treat disease. For example, Handelman (1967:451) reports that a Washo shaman would "at some point during the course of the ritual . . . receive visions relating to both the cause of the illness and the prognosis." Shamans induce enhanced visual mental imagery in order to "see" and identify disease entities within the ill client's body and then perform specific imagery-based techniques to remove them (see Harner 1980). 17 Mental imagery therefore plays an important role in shamanic healing. Divination has also been an important goal of vision cultiva- tion. The use of unstructured visual stimuli (e.g., crystal balls, pans of water, etc.) to induce mental imagery for divinatory purposes extends far back into pagan antiquity (Daiches 1913; Dodds 1951, 1971). A fertile area in experimental parapsychol- ogy is the exploration of the relationship of imagery to psi (George 1981, 1982; George and Krippner 1984). Shamans 16 Anisimov (1963:112) seems to describe the shaman's journey and performance as group training in imagery mnemonic skills when he reports that among the Evenks "such activity . . . was carried out by the shaman during a mass performance at which his fellow clansmen were not only active participants but also an inspired audience, capa- ble of seeing in waking hallucination everything the shaman saw and said. " 450 17 For example, "It is during his hallucinations that a paye can diagnose a disease, know its cause, discuss its treatment with Vih6- mahse (the Master of Snuff), and learn the correct formulas he has to pronounce over the patient. Sometimes the patient, too, must take a hallucinogenic drug, and he will then describe his visions to the paye, in search of clues to the causes and adequate treatment of the afflic- tion" (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975:89). CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">have employed such techniques, particularly the use of quartz crystals (Harner 1980) and brass mirrors (Shirokogoroff 1935:299-300), for clairvoyant and precognitive purposes. In- deed, the use of enhanced visual mental imagery for divination may be an integral part of almost every magico-religious tradi- tion (Winkelman 1982). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Shamanism has been examined here as an introduction to the possibility of studying mental imagery cultivation as a worldwide cultural phenomenon. Mental imagery cultivation is a construct that unifies an immense and disparate body of ethnographic and historical evidence for the adaptive use of mental imagery. Mental imagery ability is part of the "generic human personality structure, shared by all human beings" (Bourguignon 1979:2 1), and where we find evidence of mental imagery cultivation we shall also no doubt discover that such cultivation has adaptive consequences. Shamanism in tradi- tional, nonliterate societies is the most dramatic example of mental imagery cultivation that can be found. There are, how- ever, other rich cultural and historical sources of evidence that supports the idea of mental imagery cultivation as a cultural phenomenon. The following areas may reward further research: 1. The Vajrayana tradition of Buddhism provides abundant and accessible evidence for mental imagery cultivation. This tradition involves intensive visualization training based on a series of elaborate icons that must be successfully reproduced in full detail in the "mind's eye" during meditation practice (Govinda 1960; Guenther and Trungpa 1975:47-52; Odin 1982). 2. Evidence for mental imagery cultivation can be found in the medieval Islamic practice of "visionary recitals" and other forms of imaginative autonomy documented by Corbin (1960, 1966, 1969). In particular, there seems to be some evidence for a "vision-guardian spirit" complex among medieval Sufis who called themselves the Uwaysis and were taught by "spiritual guides" that they met in visions (Corbin 1969:32). Similarly, the Spanish-born Arab theologian Ibn 'Arabi (1165-1240) "was, and never ceased to be, the disciple of an invisible mas- ter" named Khadir (Corbin 1969:32), whom he met in vi- sionary states. Perhaps shamanism is only one example of a widespread "vision-guardian spirit" complex, despite the con- trary conclusion by Swanson (1973:372). 3. In Western civilization there are at least two main areas of strong evidence for mental imagery cultivation: the occult science of classical, medieval, and Renaissance Europe, espe- cially the occult traditions of ritual magic (Butler 1949), al- chemy (Jung 1968[1944]), and witchcraft (Harner 1973b), and the history of psychotherapy (see Ellenberger 1970), from the medieval and Renaissance concept of imaginatio (Ellenberger 1967:161; see also McMahon 1976) to "magnetic" and "hyp- notic" visions to 20th-century psychotherapeutic techniques for inducing mental imagery (see Watkins 1976, Singer and Pope 1978, Sheikh 1984). Of special interest are Freud's early "pres- sure" technique and later "free association" method,'8 Ferenc- zi's "forced phantasies" (Ferenczi 1926), and Jung's technique of "active imagination" (Jung 1969 [1957]; see also Hull 1971), Noll: THE ROLE OF VISIONS IN SHAMANISM which he apparently borrowed in name and practice from its medieval magical context. Comments by JEANNE ACHTERBERG Department of Rehabilitation Science, School of Allied Health Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center at Dallas, Dallas, Tex. 75235, U.S.A. 15 IV 85 It is with great difficulty that I fashion an objective comment on Noll's scholarly article. When the article was sent to me for review, my own book Imagery in Healing: Shamanism and Modern Medicine was about to be released by New Science Library (Boulder: Shambhala Publications). It should be clear from the title that Noll and I independently sought the same data base, albeit from different perspectives. He offers an ex- cellent summary of the psychological and anthropological liter- ature, melding it together with the concept of imagery. My intent was to demonstrate the ancient, ubiquitous role of the imagination in medicine, focusing on the shaman as the master healer in the imaginary realms and supporting the thesis with biological fact whenever possible. We have come to a singular conclusion regarding imagery as the essence of many shamanic practices and as a cross-cultural resource for diagnostic and therapeutic information. However, I would argue that the research on imagery has actually been quite paltry, despite a flurry of recent interest. The subject remains out of favor in the "hard-nosed" psychological and medical communities, despite its 10,000-20,000-year history as a healing modality. Even bringing together the two bodies of information, imagery and shamanism, is a reasonably novel conjecture. Certainly, continued description of the history and ethno- graphic aspects of mental imagery is appropriate, as Noll suggests. In order to reinstate imagery as a legitimate, even indispensable, aspect of medicine and psychology, additional research must answer two difficult questions: What are the psychobiological mechanisms involved in the phenomenon? Does it work for any of the purposes its tenacious history sug- gests? by ERIKA BOURGUIGNON Department of Anthropology, The Ohio State University, 124 W. 17th Ave., Columbus, Ohio 43210-1364, U.S.A. 15 III 85 In introducing the concept of mental imagery cultivation and its application to shamanism Noll has performed a useful ser- vice. The distinction between enhancing vividness and in- creasing controlledness in the process of shamanistic training should be helpful not only in guiding our reading of the extant descriptions but, more importantly, in directing our attention to new information to be gathered. The large literature on dreams allows us to distinguish between societies or groups that consider dreaming important-and as a result not only enhance memory of dreams but also influence the style and content of dreams-and those that consider dreams merely private and negligible. A similar distinction appears to exist with reference to mental imagery. "Visualization" or "imaging" is a process used in various contemporary American religious movements as well as in some forms of secular alternative healing. Csordas (1983:337) describes the process in the Healing of Memories ritual among Catholic Charismatics, where "the supplicant may be asked to visualize, i.e., to induce a mental image or picture of, any painful incident that is uncovered. An essential element of the 18 Freud seems to have been aware of the similarity of the free- associative techniques of psychoanalysis to the mental imagery en- hancement techniques of the occult sciences: "It is easy to imagine, too, Lhat certain mystical practices may succeed in upsetting the normal relations between the different regions of the mind, so that, for in- stance, perception may be able to grasp happenings in the depths of the zgo and in the id which were otherwise inaccessible to it. It may be ;afely doubted, however, whether this road will lead us to the ultimate truths from which salvation is to be expected. Nevertheless it may be 3dmitted that the therapeutic efforts of psychoanalysis have chosen a ;imilar line of approach" (Freud 1965[1933]:71). Vol. 26 * No. 4 * August-October 1985</page><page sequence="10">image is the healing presence of Jesus in human form." The healer may have a relevant vision as well. Wagner (1983) notes "visualization" or "programming" among the activities of the Spiritual Frontiers Fellowship, a "new religion." In contrast to the Catholic Charismatics, who use visualization of past events for healing, members of the Spiritual Frontiers Fellowship vi- sualize desired states ranging from healing to weather control, from weight loss to interpersonal events. The type of visualization (static pictures or moving scenes, past, present, or future, observations or participation by sub- ject) and the methods used to obtain it need to be investigated in relationship to the group's mythology and, specifically, its concept of power. Although visions are often discussed in the context of psy- chedelic drugs, other methods, including sensory deprivation, are of importance (see Henney 1974:70-79, for a comparison of experimentally and ritually induced visions/hallucinations linked to sensory deprivation). That enhanced mental imagery need not be linked to altered states of consciousness is sug- gested by its very important role in the plastic and graphic arts and in literature and other art forms and analogous processes in other sensory modalities (auditory, tactile, kinesthetic). Con- cerning prehistory, it is evident that the great painters and sculptors of the Upper Paleolithic caves supplemented what- ever sketches they may have had with very vivid visual recol- lections and imagery. Through art, mental imagery as a mne- monic device can be given a socially shared shape. by LEONARD GEORGE Department of Psychology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ont., Canada N6A 5C2. 22 III 85 Noll's paper exemplifies interdisciplinary scholarship at its finest. The perspective presented in his paper highlights the importance of enhanced imaginal processes in many cultures and suggests that, within every population, there exists a group of individuals who potentially have a special relation- ship with the imaginal dimensions of experience. If this is so, one important question concerns the role of such persons in modern Western culture. Psychological research has shown that imaginally oriented persons can be identified in our society in such forms as fantasy-prone personalities and hypnotically talented subjects (Barber 1984). Systematic imagery enhance- ment is occurring among a proportion of these persons, in the form of occult practices, meditation, and, as Noll mentions, some forms of psychotherapy (see George n.d.). Because there is no modern institutionalized equivalent to shamanism in which imaginally oriented people can exercise their capacities, they may exist unnoticed in a variety of contemporary cultural niches. One wonders if the relative nonrecognition of imaginal realms by our society is an optimal state of affairs. If imaginal experience is vital to spiritual exploration, as Noll's perspective implies, perhaps the denigration of "mere" imagination and the epidemic crisis of meaning in the 20th century are more than coincidental. How did the modern devaluation of imaginal experience come about? Some scholars have traced its roots as far back as the 8th-century Council of Nicaea (Avens 1980); others have emphasized the rise of Cartesian dualism as a major con- tributor (McMahon and Sheikh 1984). Generally speaking, the modern attitude of marginalizing the imagination, when most premodern and non-Western cultures grant imaginal entities a primary role in their conceptions of the world, must have had a multidetermined and unusual evolution. There are signs that the postmodern attitude will be more balanced. A variety of thinkers have begun to discuss the possible value of revoking the ontological priority customarily assigned to concrete reality over the imaginal sphere (e.g., Buchler 1966, Epstein 1981, Hillman 1983), and serious note is being taken of the imaginal sophistication of Eastern civilizations (e.g., Guenther 1976, Odin 1982, O'Flaherty 1984). The attitude taken toward the multiplicity of potentially ex- perienceable worlds may be a crucial feature of the shamanic mind and is not examined in depth in Noll's article. Imagery, in addition to being vivid and controllable, must be viewed as nontrivial in order to have an effect on a society, and to under- stand this phenomenon one must look at the epistemic struc- tures which provide the context for the shaman's imaginal pro- cesses (cf. Al-Issa 1977). Important questions concerning the attitude variable remain unanswered but seem amenable to empirical investigation. For instance, to what extent does the shaman's imaginal vividness account for, or depend upon, his/ her ability to grant the status of reality to mental images? Is the shaman or imaginally oriented person in general characterized by a global tendency to bridge other dichotomous categories in addition to those of "reality" and "fantasy"? Shamans in tradi- tional cultures, as well as the fantasy-prone personalities of the modern one, could be examined in this regard. Perhaps recent advances in the study of categorization by psychologists (e.g., Tversky and Hemenway 1984) and anthropologists (e.g., Wierzbicka 1984) can provide conceptual tools for such research. Our understanding of these complexities can only benefit from such skillful mediation between the worlds of anthropol- ogy and psychology as is found in Noll's article-truly a nota- ble feat of academic shamanism. by MICHAEL HARNER Department of Anthropology, Graduate Faculty, New Schoolfor Social Research, 65 Fifth Ave., New York, N.Y. 10003, U.S.A. 12 III 85 I welcome Noll's article as his second major contribution to the study of shamanism from his disciplinary perspective in psy- chology (see also Noll 1983). I further see the sophistication of his work as bearing the fruit of the new participant- observation approach in shamanic studies; Noll has trained with me firsthand in the classic shamanic methods. In such training and in my guide to shamanic practice (Harner 1980:esp. 21-56 and 136-37), I have emphasized the impor- tance of visualization cultivation in shamanic work, including the shamanic journey, shamanic divination, and the extraction of illness. One caveat: while visualization is the basic and minimum sensory experience of the shamanic journey, all the other sensory experiences-hearing, smell, taste, and touch- also commonly come into play. The essential, however, is still imagery, and it is virtually impossible to experience the sha- manic journey and most of shamanic practice without the abil- ity to visualize. In my training of Westerners and others in shamanic methods, I have found that approximately nine out of ten persons have the capacity for the visualization necessary to the shamanic journey. Interestingly, among Westerners, those who tend to have the most difficulty are often profession- als in the fields of law, mathematics, linguistics, and philoso- phy-so-called left-brain specialists heavily devoted to logic in their work. by LAURI HONKO Nordic Institute of Folklore, University of Turku, 20500 Turku, Finland. 10 Iv 85 In a study on spirit beliefs in Ingria (Honko 1962, 1964) 1 was able to establish an interesting contrast between "casual" and "ritual" encounters of spirits. In casual encounters, which could be linked with breaches of norms, the appearance of the spirit was seemingly spontaneous, surprising, and full of "vivid mental imagery"; the ritual encounters, which conformed to norms, were almost devoid of graphic visions of the spirit. The real locus of vivid supranormal imagery would thus seem to be outside ritual, in the realm of unexpected encounters in which CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">man finds himself the object-not the subject-of supranor- mal activity. The "vision quest" found in shamanism and other contexts would not, then, belong to the mainstream of ritual behavior and would indeed require in its ritualized form tech- niques for an activation or, as Noll puts it, cultivation of men- tal imagery. The extensive preparatory ritual that the shaman performs in solitude before each seance, which has escaped Noll's attention, represents a concentration of mental power and a shift from one cognitive map to another with the aim of becoming a shaman once more. I have described this role- taking of the shaman (1969:26-55) as the psychological core of the ritual process in question: most of what Noll describes as mental imagery may be further analysed as counter-roles of the shaman. The concept of role not only organises the perceptual materials and reveals the structure of the ritual but also relates images to their significances. The learning of supranormal counter-roles, role sets, and role sequences and their signifi- cance in the ideographic system is the essence of the process of initiation that every novice must undergo. Initiation visions are of the utmost importance: it is here that the models of perception and concrete mental images are created in a system that will be reproduced in every seance. The system is tradi- tional but also contains individual creation and choice, as is beautifully depicted by Popov (1963:149-59; cf. Siikala 1978:175-87). The concept of "mental imagery" tends to misrepresent things by being too comprehensive and, paradoxically, too nar- row. If all mental images and their cultivation are included in the analysis, one tends to lose sight of the special character of supranormal or other marginal phenomena (i.e., phenomena marginal also from the point of view of the experiencing and perceiving person). The limitation to the visual modality of perception is detrimental to the understanding of the process- ing of mental images, which includes not only what the sha- man sees but also what he hears, touches, smells, and tastes. Paraphernalia such, as the costume, the pipe, the drum, etc., are instrumental in reactivating models of experience from the past, from the initiation and the previous seances of the sha- man in question. The stimulus which releases a mental image may come from any modality of perception or from an inter- play of two or more sensory modes. by AKE HULTKRANTZ Institute of Comparative Religion, University of Stockholm, 106 91 Stockholm, Sweden. 7 IV 85 Noll's paper is a welcome contribution to the analytic literature on ''visions" in societies in which shamanism and vision quests occur. His discussion of the cultivation of visions is of major importance, and most of his arguments are convincing. There are to my understanding some limitations in his presentation, however, that sometimes reduce the value of his argumenta- tion. I am referring here in particular to Noll's arbitrary use of the concept of shamanism. It seems to be a vague, all-inclusive concept, taking in both well-developed Siberian shamanism and the mostly nonshamanic vision quest in North Amer- ica. The old American tradition of equating "shaman" and "medicine man"-two not necessarily identical concepts if we retain the original meaning of the former term-is also notice- able. After the criticisms by several authors, including myself, of Eliade's definition of soul flight as the essential mani- festation of shamanic ecstasy, it is a bit exasperating to find that Noll, without discussion, accepts this interpretation. He claims that the shamanic soul flight is a universal feature of shamanism and that shamanism is primarily concerned with its visual cultivation. This is not correct. Shamans also have seances in which the spirits appear (without necessarily pos- sessing them: the situation is usually one of spiritual inspira- tion). The main quality of the shaman is his ability through Vol. 26 *No. 4 *August-October 1985 Noll: THE ROLE OF VISIONS IN SHAMANISM ecstasy to create contact with the supernatural world; whether he makes a soul flight or calls on the spirits is a question of professional choice and cultural ways. Noll's suggestion that some form of imaginal stimulus train- ing is essential to the training of the novice shaman can only be considered justified if we have a full-fledged shamanic teacher- pupil relationship and a specialized characterization of sha- manhood. Many of the North American "shamans" would fall away here. To Noll, caught in a psychological thought pattern, the sha- man's goal is enhanced mental imagery. Again, it seems prefer- able to be more precise and, using the believer's own emic approach, to say clearly that the goal is liberating a soul, coun- selling with the powers of the other world, divining the future, and so on. The enhanced capacity for imagery is only a prereq- uisite for realizing these goals. This confusion between vi- sionary capacity and visionary contents affects the author's interpretation when he defines spirit mastery as controlled mental imagery. Now, spirit mastery rather than passive mediumism seems to be characteristic of most shamanism, as we can learn from a vivid discussion in the journal Ethnos 25 years ago (cf. Hultkrantz 1978:43-47). Still, the shaman's at- titude to the spirits varies with their roles: he is forced to obey the spirits that call him into office but can command the spirits that assist him. In some instances the obeyed and the com- manded spirits are separate entities. As Backman has pointed out, data from Lapp (Saami) shamanism show that we are dealing with two different spirit categories (Backman and Hultkrantz 1978:42-43). As far as is known there is, however, no evidence of different mental imagery for the two sets of spirits. Another mistaken generalization is the postulation that the shaman knows more than others, that it is his responsibility to remember for his tribesmen. On the contrary, during my fieldwork among the Shoshoni I found that the most prominent medicine men were less reliable historians, even when it con- cerned religious traditions, than some traditionalists in their society. One medicine man was corrected by his wife and brother-in-law when he had to account for certain religious ceremonies. I think that field experience would convince Noll that his presentation of shamanism is an ideal construction. Also, his contention that shamanic visionary training may facilitate the retention of mythological beliefs is too categorical. Among the Mohave, for instance, shamans (and other persons as well) dream new myths. Noll has omitted to discuss the influence of drugs on the exercise of mental imagery. However, in most cases shamanic trance is furthered by the aid of tobacco, alcohol, mushrooms, and other psychotropic means. How much of mental imagery cultivation can be traced to these auxiliaries? Finally, some random notes on the literature: There is at least one work observing the complex of mental imagery in shamanism; Arbman (1968) examines the role of the vision in forming ecstatic shamanic experiences. Concerning Kroeber's view of shamans as pathological, he modified his standpoint in later days (Kroeber 1952:317-19). by STANLEY KRIPPNER Saybrook Institute, 1772 Vallejo St., San Francisco, Calif. 94123, U.S.A. 16 ill 85 Shamans can be described as individuals (typically from hunt- ing-and-gathering societies) who purport to regulate their at- tention voluntarily so as to access information not available to other members of the group that has awarded them their social role, using this information to ameliorate physical or psycho- logical conditions of the group members. In other words, sha- mans appear to alter their state of consciousness in order to 453</page><page sequence="12">enter "nonordinary reality," bringing back power and knowl edge that is used to diagnose and treat illness, communicat with the spirit world, find lost objects, locate potential source of food, predict weather fluctuations, empower warriors wh are about to fight enemy tribes, etc. The information that shamans allegedly acquire from mod ifying their internal attention states is typically reported ir terms of imagery. Symbols of one sort or another often are usec to decorate shamans' costumes, ritualistic paraphernalia, anc home and work settings. In addition, shamans will often inter pret symbols reported from tribal members' dreams, visior quests, encounters with "totem animals," and experiences dur ing a variety of synchronous (coincidental) events. Auditor: imagery (in the form of spontaneous chants or songs, voices from discarnate entities, or messages from nature spirits) anc kinesthetic imagery (in the form of automatisms, spontaneoua symbolic dancing, or sensations of internal "energy flow") ar4 also interpreted when they are manifested by tribal member! or by the shamans themselves. Thus shamans live in a miliet of internally generated imagery and an external world in whici symbolic material is constantly appearing, requiring interpre tation. Noll has expanded the domain of potential psychologica research topics by exploring the shaman's use of imagery. H4 has correctly observed that altered states of consciousness are to the shaman, not an end in themselves but facilitate th4 generation of certain images which serve adaptive functions ir the tribal setting. I agree with his depiction of shamans ac "fantasy-prone personality types," a more accurate assessmenl than the labels of "recovered hysteric" and "compensate( schizophrenic" that are often applied to them. The study of shamanic imagery is important for several rea- sons. As humankind's first healers, shamans developed the us( of imagery in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. The mechanisms involved are still unknown, but it has been re- ported that scores on the standardized Imagery of Disease tesl predict remission from cancer with greater accuracy than phys- iological indices (Achterberg and Lawlis 1984). Similar imag- ery analyses with the same test have been found to correlate with immunological responses in healthy subjects (e. g., Schneider, Smith, and Whitcher 1983). An even more provocative set of findings pertains to "psi' phenomena-those interactions which are said to transcend ordinary constraints of time, space, and force. Reports of al- legedly gifted "psychics" suggest the key role played by vivid imagery in the manifestation of "psi." The experimental data on imagery and "psi" are inconsistent; however, the same can be said for the relationship between imagery and another hy- pothetical construct, hypnotic susceptibility. From the standpoint of social psychology, there is at least one other reason shamanic imagery is an important topic. As a historian, mythmaker, and storyteller, the shaman not only reflects the culture of his or her people but directs the develop- ment of that culture. The shaman is more knowledgeable, more adept, and more potent in dealing with unseen power; than anyone else in the community (Rogers 1982:14). Shamans predate priests as custodians and promulgators of an estab- lished set of dogmas and rituals (Winkelman 1984a). To what extent does the private imagery of the shaman become the public symbolism of the culture? Shamanic studies have a great deal to teach us about the part that imagery can play in directing both the healing process of the individual and the cultural enrichment of the tribe. by CHRISTIE W. KIEFER Human Development and Aging Program, University oJ California, San Francisco, Caif. 94143, U.S.A. 15 III 85 The basic idea of Noll's artikcle, that mental imagery cultiva- tion holds the key to much of man's religious and scientific life, 454 is correct. Here I would like to try to model briefly a series of steps in the evolution of Western scientific epistemology that might clarify a bit the relationships Noll is interested in. Type 1: Anthropomorphic universe. As did early literates such as the Homeric Greeks and the Hebrew patriarchs of Genesis, most nonliterate people think of the universe in an- thropomorphic terms. Everything has the same sort of con- sciousness that humans have. The personal is the universal. Since knowledge gives a person power, he guards what he knows, passing it only in confidence to those whom he trusts and loves. Everything else in the universe guards "its" knowl- edge in the same way. The wise man is therefore someone who has the cleverness to coax or steal knowledge from other hu- man and nonhuman sources (a belief reflected in the biblical story of the Fall and in the myth of Prometheus). Since the knowledge held by animals, plants, and other natural phenom- ena is inaccessible to man in his normal waking consciousness, the wise man develops states in which he can communicate directly with the nonhuman world. Hobbes and others not- withstanding, it is of course a mistake to think that primitives cannot tell the difference between fantasy and perception. Their very expertise in fantasy cultivation proves that they can and that they consider the knowledge achieved this way equal or superior in epistemological status to sense knowledge. Type 2: Conscious supraindividual universe. Written history and urban architecture deposit into man's experience a sense that there exists a knowledge greater than that of any individ- ual and teaches that the present world is temporary and par- tial. The universe for the Socratic Greeks and the Hebrew prophets was still conscious but now possessed a conscious- ness superior to the individual's. The personal was no longer the absolute. The wise man sought to approach the absolute through either the study of texts (the Hebrews), the study of things (Aristotle), or the study of the mind itself (Plato). Mental imagery could certainly help, but what tended to accumulate in the written records was the abstract, not the experiential- that is, knowledge accessible to ordinary waking conscious- ness. Type 3: Nonconscious, lawful universe. The Copernican dis- covery that the universe could be understood on the analogy of a machine, as opposed to a being, opened the question whether the mind itself was also a machine. Hobbes was the first to argue convincingly and clearly for this view and thereby to bring back to the center of philosophical inquiry the question of the relationship between perception and imagination. By making imagination a pale copy of sensation, he founded scientific psychology on a narrowly empiricist footing. His ideas were picked up by Locke and Hume and given substance by early developmentalists such as Tiedemann and F. A. Carus. Fortified by functional models from evolutionary biol- ogy, these ideas have guided much of the research in physiol- ogy, embryology, and ethology, not to mention epistemology and ethics, down to the present, in spite of many countermove- ments beginning with German romanticism around 1800. Psy- choanalysis, of course, sought to establish an empirical basis for the study of fantasy and mental imagery but focussed some- what fruitlessly on the search for empirical bases of the con- tents of nonordinary thought. Noll's work does much to restore the study of mental imagery to its rightful place in the study of man because it focusses on the observable processes of mental imagery cultivation and on observable cultural beliefs about these processes and their products. by RICHARD J. PRESTON Department of Anthropology, McMaster University, Hamil- ton, Ont., Canada L8S 4L9. 11 III 85 Noll's synthesis is both good science and refreshing reading. My major challenge is to the hypothesis that the more vivid the CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="13">image, the more closely it approximates a perceived actuality. While this may sometimes be true, there are important nega- tive cases that demand a less intellectualist theory. A classic case is Gregorio, the hand trembler, who told Leighton of his vision experience of a bright light. When Leighton pursued this, he was told that it wasn't a light really, it just seemed that way. Vividness, then, may as easily be a character of feeling as one of clarity, and then Plato (and Casey) have more guidance to offer us than Aristotle (and Finke and Winkelman). I think that Noll is close to this with his term "affective acceptance." The synthesis of psychology and ethnology is very effective, but we can be a little more ambitious. Probably Noll will agree that the discipline of concentrating one's mind on imaging is shared by shamans, mystics, poets, and others, with some strong similarity or even identity of processes. A central refer- ence (not merely this critic's indulgence) is Coleridge's treat- ment of fancy and imagination (Brett 1969:31-53). It is also interesting that the enhancement and control of visual imagery may have more pedestrian outcomes, as Luria's (1968) superb case study shows. There is more at stake than enhancement and control; the creative imagination has additional aspects of selection and organization that may be discerned and defined to further Noll's argument. Perhaps, too, the current research on controlled-content dreaming can offer some insight. In any event, I think this paper has enduring value and congratulate Noll on his intellectual breadth and thorough researching. by ANNA-LEENA SIIKALA Lohitie 2A4, 02170 Espoo 17, Finland. 15 Iv 85 Rapid recent developments in research into cognitive processes have drawn attention not only to the observation, organisa- tion, memorisation, and interpretation of knowledge but also to the role of imagery in these processes. The results of cogni- tive science would appear to provide great potential for the examination of the relationship between mythic imagery and visionary experiences. Traditional visions, familiar above all in religio-magical contexts, are shaped according to the cul- tural schemes relating to these experiences. Noll's article, in which visions are examined as the outcome of conscious mental imagery cultivation, provides a new and unquestionably fruit- ful starting point for the study of both shamanistic and other visionary experiences. The initiation of a shaman includes a period during which the novice studies and internalises the shamanistic tradition and forms a mental image of the spirits and the topography of the other world. The tales recounted by individual shamans indicate that Noll's theory that the initiate consciously tries to increase the vividness of his visual mental imagery while at the same time striving towards the control of these experiences is indeed valid. Concentration on the imagery of the spirit world, along with other, e.g., neurophysiological, means, is a signifi- cant inducer of trance during the seance. In comparing the shamanistic trance to the Western altered state of conscious- ness achieved with the aid of hypnosis, I referred to the point in question by speaking, in the manner of Shor (1959), of a special orientation that supersedes the generalised reality orientation. The shaman's generalised reality orientation is cut off by means of suitable ritual requisites, the extinguishing of the lights, and the noise of accelerating drumming. Its place is taken by a special orientation, a world created by the shamanic tradition, fantasies of supranormal beings and their dwelling places (Siikala 1978:333). Noll formulates the nature of this special orientation more precisely by speaking of enhanced mental imagery. Noll's article raises a number of interesting research prob- lems. Nevertheless, I wish to look first at the greatest limita- tion shared by the bulk of Western research into shamanism. In the article shamanism is conceived of as a homogeneous phenomenon characterised by visionary experiences and soul Vol. 26 *No. 4 *August-October 1985 Noll: THE ROLE OF VISIONS IN SHAMANISM flight in the course of trance. I have on a previous occasion attempted to show that the meeting with the spirits during the seance and the forms of trance varied even in the "classical" shamanism of Siberia and Central Asia. In working towards various practical goals, the shaman must always, through his spirit helpers, make contact with the other world. This he does in one of several ways dictated by the belief tradition. In north- western and northern Siberia we find visionary trance con- nected with the soul-flight idea, in central and eastern Siberia possession trance based on pronounced motoric activity. The shaman in Central Asia may meet the spirits at the shamanis- ing site, and not only in seances of soul-flight type; in this case visions and auditions play a considerable role. In northeastern Siberia, on the other hand, the shaman may, by means of ventriloquism and various tricks, give the audience the impres- sion that there is a large band of spirits present at the seance. It should be remembered that during the seance the Siberian and Central Asian shaman does not merely project himself into the spirit world but retains contact as necessary with those pres- ent. The extent to which he has to allow for his audience influences the way and the intensity in which the spirit world is manifest and the depth of his trance. It is ultimately a question of the relationship between the shaman and his supporters; this is in turn determined by the social organisation of the ethnic group in question, its culture, etc. Although visionary experi- ences do occupy a leading position during the initiation of a Siberian shaman, their importance and their nature vary in the seance traditions of different regions. I do not consider the concept "state of shamanistic con- sciousness" a happy choice. "State of consciousness" refers to man's psychophysical functions, "shamanistic" to special forms of tradition. All manner of altered states of consciousness, be- ginning with sleep, can be shamanistic in their tradition con- tent. On the other hand, visionary states of trance such as those encountered in shamanism can also be found in other cultural contexts. Noll's approach is best suited to the study of imagery-oriented visionary trance. One interesting question is then the relationship between intensive imagery and trance. How does one proceed from mental imagery in a waking state to the visions of what are thought to be "real" events character- istic of trance? What is the position of mental imagery cultiva- tion in trance techniques involving sensory deprivation or powerful sensory bombardment? The latter embrace shaman- istic possession trances, which are characterised by the virtual or total absence of hallucinations. We should, in accounting for the mechanisms behind sha- manistic visions, pay special attention to the relationship be- tween the shamanistic tradition and the shaman's imagery. Shamanistic narratives and songs are made up of mythical imagery. From these initiates draw the motifs both for their visions and for their songs, which observe traditional schemes. For example, the visions of Samoyed shamans follow tradi- tional models in both their structure and their content. It is also of note that during his initiation period the novice must learn to interpret what he sees; he must "guess" what each element of a vision represents. It seems obvious that the novice, possibly under the guidance of an older shaman, selects from the stream of imagery items that bear shamanistic meaning. Through rec- ognition and interpretation he brings the image into focus, gives it life, and develops it, for mythic images of the other world are made up of frame-type information complexes. For example, tradition has it that there is an anvil and fire in the dwelling of the smith spirits conducting the mystic initiation of the Samoyed shaman and that the spirits dissect and reassem- ble the shaman's body. Through this image-recognition- interpretation the initiate is able to experience ever widening fields of tradition in his mind. Since the recognition experiences are felt to be significant, it is easy to recall their images at some 455</page><page sequence="14">later date. In fact, I assume that the controlledness of the experienced visual imagery mentioned by Noll simply refers to the fact that the initiate gradually acquires a sufficient store of visual skills connected with the shamanistic world-presages of shamanistic observations. As the shaman seeking trance concentrates on these images to the point that his generalised reality orientation vanishes, these presages come to be real "observations" in his altered state of consciousness. by IRItNE S. VASQUEZ and BARBARA W. LEX The Mary Ingraham Bunting Institute, Radcliffe College, 10 Garden St., Cambridge, Mass. 02138/Harvard-McLean Al- cohol and Drug Abuse Research Center, Department of Psy- chiatry, Harvard Medical School and McLean Hospital, 115 Mill St., Belmont, Mass. 02178, U.S.A. 12 Iv 85 We are puzzled over the raison d'etre of this piece. It abounds with unsupported global statements and internal contradic- tions that undermine its arguments. Moreover, it uses the liter- ature selectively to advance its basic premise. In an earlier paper Noll (1983) established the groundwork for laying to rest the long-belabored contention that shamanism largely resides in the domain of "schizophrenic" behavior. That article also employed a notion of a ubiquitous "shamanic state of con- sciousness" that appeared to draw legitimacy from 19th- century reifications of the "psychic unity of mankind." One of us (Lex 1984) has already pointed out that the biophysiological states attained by persons labeled shamans are unlikely to con- stitute a unitary and sharply delimited phenomenon. Without empirical data, a "biological constant" cannot be assumed (Wallace 1975). For example, evidence is accumulating for cross-cultural differences in metabolism and sensitivity to drugs affecting the central nervous system that can only be explained by subtle neurohumoral differences (Murphy 1969, Binder and Levy 1981). In his current effort Noll marshalls a concatenation of sources describing a wide array of disparate phenomena to claim that the uniform goal of shamanic practices is found in the process of striving to attain and manipulate enhanced vi- sual mental imagery. Thus mental imagery-but only of the visual sort-is presented as the teleological core of shamanism. Several aspects of this approach are particularly troublesome to students of religion. It is culture-bound insofar as it per- petuates common-parlance (i.e., idiomatic to English) expres- sions of sensory, cognitive, and affective apprehension via the visual mode (e.g., it is instructive to consider the sensory dif- ference between "I see what you mean" and "I grasp your idea"). The absence of operational definitions of "mental imag- ery," "altered states of consciousness," or even "shamanism" compounds the difficulty, and thus the goal of shamanic prac- tices is lost. As we understand the classic disquisitions on shamanism, some of which Noll himself cites, the goal of shamanism has a number of interrelated biological, psychological, social, and cultural aspects (cf. Katz 1982). Selection of one sensory mode for examination may serve as a heuristic to illuminate the com- plexities of shamanic practices and social roles. Choosing en- hanced visual mental imagery as the prime intention of sha- manic endeavor, however, decontextualizes shamanic acts, turns performance into mechanical behavior, and empties sha- manic traditions of symbolic meaning. While there may be some virtue in examining the "vividness" (intensity) or "con- trolledness" (techniques) of actual visual experience, lack of op- erational definitions, cogent and exclusive illustrations of their applications, and strict documentation of the rules of perfor- mance makes the purpose of this paper opaque. by MICHAEL WINKELMAN School of Social Sciences, University of California, Irvine, Calif. 92717, U.S.A. 9 iv 85 Noll's consideration of psychophysiological states induced by mental imagery cultivation is important, but concern with vi- sions to the exclusion of auditory imagery has limited his per- ception of the importance of mental imagery. In differentiating visual-based trance states or altered states of consciousness from those involving auditory phenomena, Noll has over- looked the psychophysiological similarities of trances with vi- sual and auditory experiences (see Lex 1979, Mandel 1980, Winkelman 1984b) and the importance of altered states of consciousness in traditions which cultivate mental imagery. He suggests that the relationship between mental imagery and magico-religious traditions appears to hold regardless of societal complexity. Although shamanic-type visions are found in many societies, they are typical of simpler societies, while possession trance, which tends to involve auditory perceptions, is typical of more complex ones (Bourguignon 1968). Why simi- lar traditions should specialize with respect to sensory modality is an important research question. Noll contends that altered states of consciousness are means for enhancing mental imagery, not ends in themselves. He sug- gests that the adaptive value of mental imagery lies in improv- ing mnemonic function, providing organization in retention of mythological beliefs and other culturally relevant materials. Mental imagery in shamanic traditions may function to improve memory, but it has a more important role in inducing trance states to facilitate healing and divination. Evans-Wentz (1978[1935]) points out that yogic traditions use visualization to induce altered states of consciousness and develop psychic abilities. The field-ground reversal discussed by Noll as a mental imagery technique provides an internal focus of attention which is characteristic of altered states, facilitating their induction. Noll suggests that techniques for enhancing mental imagery activate unconscious nonvolitional levels of psychophysiology and that shamans are selected on the basis of their ability to experience mental images. He does not, however, consider the physiological changes or the tem- peramental predispositions that account for individual differ- ences in mental imagery. Research suggests that many factors contribute to visionary experiences through induction of hy- persynchronous slow-wave discharges from the hippocampal- septal areas of the temporal lobe (see Mandel 1980, Winkelman 1984b). These factors include the deliberate induction of visual imagery and unify visual and auditory-based altered states of consciousness in terms of a common psychophysiological basis. Noll points to two inextricably related functions of magico- religious traditions, healing and divination, and suggests that mental imagery is used first diagnostically and secondly in healing. Cross-cultural research on magico-religious prac- titioners (Winkelman 1984b) confirms the central role of heal- ing and divination in shamanic practice and illustrates that all practitioners engaging in training for altered states of con- sciousness do healing and divination, suggesting a functional relationship between altered states and these activities. Since healing and divination are performed by magico-religious practitioners using altered states of consciousness but not men- tal imagery, mental imagery cannot be central. Noll correctly suggests that mental imagery cultivation has adaptive consequences as a mnemonic device, but he overlooks more important aspects. Why would the shaman, whose pri- mary functions are healing and divination, engage in mental imagery training to improve memory skills, which appear to be secondary functions? The central role of healing and divination suggests that mental imagery training has important functions other than enhancing the shaman's memory. Production of mental imagery apparently has functional effects in facilitating healing and divination. Noll points out that enhanced visual CU RR E NT A NT HR OP OL OG Y</page><page sequence="15">imagery may facilitate divination, and Myers (1903) indicated that imagery provided the means of bringing unconscious sym- bols into consciousness. Laboratory research indicates that altered states of consciousness facilitate psi (clairvoyance) abilities (see Honorton 1977 for review), suggesting that the adaptive value of imagery is in facilitating the altered states of consciousness that improve reliability of divinatory percep- tions. Noll suggests that I did not elaborate on my 1982 obser- vation that visualization is characteristic of magical practices. That discussion did, however, reference research indicating that visualization is a successful strategy for affecting physical systems through psi (psychokinesis), suggesting, again, that visual imagery has an adaptive role in facilitating healing. While visual imagery has an important adaptive function, it is primarily in facilitating altered-state-based divination and healing rather than as a mnemonic aid. Viewing altered states of consciousness as basic permits us to explain the relationship of trance to healing and divination in trance traditions using both visual and auditory experiences. Reply by RICHARD NOLL Stratford, N.J., U.S.A. 13 v 85 I am grateful to the international group of distinguished schol- ars who have commented on my paper. For the most part I find their criticisms stimulating, as most are derived from con- ceptual contexts whose assumptions are different from my own. For example, the comments of Bourguignon, Harner, Honko, Hultkrantz, and Siikala arise from a primarily eth- nological context, whereas Vasquez and Lex and Winkelman offer a materialistic critique. I am indeed "caught in a psycho- logical thought pattern," as Hultkrantz observes, and deliber- ately so. In my analysis of shamanism as a form of mental imagery cultivation I have been guilded by one prevailing passion: to uncover and describe the phenomenology of shamanic experi- ence. I deliberately limit my discussion to the shamans who employ "imagery-oriented visionary trance," as Siikala puts it, in order to draw attention to the importance of mental imagery in the practice of certain shamanic techniques. I do not deny the importance in shamanism of possession trance or the other experienced altered states of consciousness. Nor do I deny the importance of the complex interrelationship between psycho- logical, biological, social, and cultural variables in shamanism. I examine in depth the major dimension of shamanic experi- ence that is least understood and perhaps most speculated about and misinterpreted-visions. Far more scholarly atten- tion has been given to spirit possession and spirit mastery in terms of altered states of consciousness, role playing, etc., than to visionary experience. Perhaps this is because the psychologi- cal literature has only relatively recently provided the rich ex- perimental description of mental imagery that can serve as a language for explicating that experience. Whatever operational definition is eventually (if ever) agreed upon, "mental imagery" is a useful concept for examining the phenomenology of human experience. Achterberg's kind comments came as a welcome surprise, as her work with Frank Lawlis on the clinical applications of imagery-based techniques is among the most interesting in the field. I am looking forward to reading her new book, which, from her description, would appear to elaborate on the ancient tradition of healing with imagery that receives modest atten- tion in my paper. Bourguignon's compliments are also much appreciated, as are those of Krippner, Preston, and Kiefer. George is correct in assuming that the hypothesized relation- ship between mental imagery cultivation and magico-medico- Vol. 26 *No. 4 *August-October 1985 Noll: THE ROLE OF VISIONS IN SHAMANISM religious traditions implies that "imaginal experience is vital to spiritual exploration. " In this regard I have been influenced not only by the many historical and ethnographic references to this relationship but also by the work of Henri Corbin, James Hill- man, and, in particular, C. G. Jung. Jung, himself a "fantasy- prone personality, " is most appropriately read as a phe- nomenologist-"image is psyche" (Jung 1967[1929]:50). Jung felt that the very pulse of life was somehow represented by the natural, spontaneous processes of mental imagery: "So far as our present knowledge extends, it would seem that the vital urge which expresses itself in the structure and individual form of the living organism produces in the unconscious, or is itself such a process, which on becoming partially conscious depicts itself as a fugue-like sequence of images" (Jung 1966[1935]:1 1). In Jung's view the vibrant reports of imagery in shamanic accounts revealed an underlying archetypal structure that confirmed the "psychological inference that may be drawn from shamanistic symbolism, namely that it is a projection of the individuation process," and in this regard he compared it to "philosophical" alchemy (Jung 1967[1945-54]:341). His con- ception of individuation was one of a natural transformative process nurtured by imagery-based psychotherapeutic tech- niques (active imagination)-in my terms, by mental imagery cultivation. Harner's influence on my work is considerable. His phenomenological approach to shamanism-which I have adopted-is, I believe, of paramount importance in understand- ing the ethnographic literature. Indeed, his presentation on shamanism before the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow in the summer of 1984 attests to the growing international interest in his work. That "left-brain specialists" are poor visu- alizers was first noticed by Galton a century ago in the mental imagery deficits of the "men of science": "They had no more notion of its true nature than a colour-blind man, who has not discerned his defect, has of the nature of colour. They had a mental deficiency of which they were unaware, and naturally enough supposed that those who affirmed they possessed it, were romancing" (Galton 1883:85). Honko's interesting proposal that what I describe as mental imagery "may be further analysed as counter-roles of the sha- man" deserves further study. In some ways this reminds me of the largely introjected "internal object world" of the Kleinian object-relations theorists. I strongly disagree with the state- ment, however, that "the concept of role . . . organises the perceptual materials" if Honko is implying that perceptual pro- cesses are essentially structured by learning. This is a mistake also made by Freud (1960[1923]) in suggesting that the emerg- ing ego is the organization of the perceptual world through language. The experimental studies of perception by the Ge- stalt psychologists have demonstrated that organization is an a priori condition of conscious experience and not an effect of learning (K6hler 1947, Koffka 1935). Honko, along with other commentators (Harner, Vasquez and Lex, Winkelman), criti- cizes the emphasis on the visual modality at the expense of the other modalities, particularly audition. This emphasis is delib- erate. Visual mental imagery is by far the most common type of imagery experience mentioned in the ethnographic and histor- ical literature, and the mental imagery cultivation of magico- religious complexes seems to be disproportionately concerned with the visual. In addition, the vast majority of experimental studies of mental imagery is concerned with this modality. I do not deny that auditory imagery is important (see my n. 5) or that it or any of the other modalities can occur with visual imagery, but to be consistent with the ethnographic, historical, and experimental literatures I limit my discussion to the visual modality. Hultkrantz and Siikala criticize my use of the word "shaman- 457</page><page sequence="16">ism. " Siikala correctly takes "shamanism" in my paper to mean essentially "a homogeneous phenomenon characterised by vi- sionary experiences and soul flight in the course of trance," and Hultkrantz finds this "exasperating." I deliberately adopt this (anthropologically) extreme position in order to draw attention to the prevalence of mental-imagery-based techniques among many (not all) magico-religious practitioners, many of whom fit the traditional "shaman" or "medicine man" labels. That imag- ery-based techniques are used by ecstatic specialists among such widely distributed peoples as the Washo and the Lakota Sioux of North America, the Tukano of Colombia, the Tamang of Nepal, the classic Siberian groups, the Kalahari !Kung of Africa, and the Australian Aborigines points to the valid generalizability of the concept of shamanism as a form of mental imagery cultivation. It is true that I sometimes blur the boundaries between the traditional North American vision- quest complexes and classical Siberian shamanism, but this blurring is aimed at demonstrating the universality of mental imagery cultivation as a cultural phenomenon. In this respect I submit a humble mea culpa to my more seasoned scholarly colleagues. However, although it is not clear from my paper, I do not want to convey the impression that I believe the only visual mental imagery exercise conducted by shamans is soul flight. The literature is clear, as both Hultkrantz and Siikala point out, that a shaman can invoke spirits and have them "appear" (without possession) and not embark on a shamanic journey to do so. Spirits can indeed be summoned for didactic and divinatory reasons without a "soul flight" scenario. If I am guilty of any scholarly crime, it is the adoption of an approach that sacrifices some specificity for generalizability. Hultkrantz charges that I have "omitted to discuss the in- fluence of drugs on the exercise of mental imagery." As my intention was to be as phenomenological as possible, I did not feel it appropriate to discuss specific neurophysiological or biochemical factors in imagery production. However, relevant references are cited in n. 14. Vasquez and Lex represent a "neuromythological" view- point. For them a psychological process or experience is not "legitimate" or "real" unless neurophysiological or biochemical hypotheses can be formulated to account for it. Such analyses can be of value. The problem is that in this relatively young field of study data are often prematurely cited in an explana- tory mode (hence, "neuromythologically".) The richness of hu- man experience is often lost in these analyses, and phenomena may be ignored for decades until even a tenuous materialistic hypothesis can be posited to explain them. Noam Chomsky once observed that the progress of science can be viewed as simply the translation of more and more metaphors of the mental into the metaphors of the material. The problems pre- sented by the phenomena of human experience do not change over time; what does change is the culturally derived, consen- sually acceptable baseline metaphoric language that is used to describe them. In our time and place causal explanations based on materialistic-particularly neurophysiological or biochem- ical-metaphors are granted primary validity. I chose the term "mental imagery" for its utility in phenomenological analysis. Only peripherally do I use it in a quasi-causal sense. Finke's (1980) use of it is similar-open-ended enough not to violate the phenomenological integrity of the concept and yet capable of reduction to neurophysiological function. Precision for its own sake is meaningless. Whether this renders my paper's purpose "opaque" is a judgment that I can only leave to others. Winkelman likewise interprets my lack of materialistic re- duction as a deficiency, but I see this more as a misunderstand- ing produced by a conflict of perspectives. Winkelman sees mental imagery as facilitating the induction of altered states of consciousness, whereas I argue that the induction of such states is a means of producing vivid mental imagery. (Krippner agrees with me.) As evidence Winkelman cites his studies of magico-religious practitioners and the parapsychological 458 Ganzfeld experiments of Honorton (1977). Having partici- pated in Honorton's experiments at the Psychophysiological Research Laboratory in Princeton, I want to point out that the assumption behind them is that an altered state of conscious- ness facilitates the experience of vivid imagery-the opposite of what Winkelman is claiming. I do not consider the role of mental imagery in healing and divination "unimportant," and I have not overlooked this relationship. However, I consider the relationship between mental imagery and memory much better demonstrated in the experimental literature than that between mental imagery and psi, since parapsychology has not yet found a consistent and reliable independent variable that will produce psi on demand. Honorton's exciting work demon- strates that mental imagery does play a role in psi, confirming Maimonides's assertion. "It is undoubtedly clear and evident that most prophesies are given in images, for this is the charac- teristic of the imaginative faculty, the organ of prophecy" (Maimonides 1956[1191]:247). One closing note: I have found further evidence of mental imagery cultivation as a cultural phenomenon in MacDermot's (1971) The Cult of the Seer in the Ancient Middle East. Mac- Dermot analyzes the hagiographic literature of Coptic Egypt during the early rise of Christianity and argues (p. 1) that "a feature of this period was the widespread rise of cults, con- cerned with the promotion of seership."
