Charles Martindale (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1988); Substitute the following for the paragraph on p. 321 begin- ning "Malbecco is a masterfully confused . . ." Colin Burrow observes, "Malbecco is a brilliantly confus- ing mingle of possibilities, noting that the moment before his final change is full of centrifugal opportunities for the even- tual metamorphosis: he could become a monstrous fowl, Fear, or a second Despaire" ("Metamorphoses in the Faerie Queene," 114). In fact, because he has been subjected to such a myriad of comparisons, his identity, it seems, is eternally poised for change. This Ovidian protraction of the transfor- mation, with its startling twists and cruel distortions, con- flicts in some sense with what Angus Fletcher would call the "compulsive teleology" of the allegory in this episode, the force that moves Malbecco so swiftly and relentlessly toward abstraction. This drive toward closure is typically linear, unswerving in its focus on end. In this wild prelude to the final change, however, Spenser reveals the strenuous contor- tions, linguistic and phenomenological, that lie beneath alle- gory's surface movement. Each of Spenser's new metaphors provides a new visual image of the man, decomposing and superseding the one before, forcing the metamorphosis.</page><page sequence="2">The Metamorphosis of Malbecco: Allegorical Violence and Ovidian Change by Louise Gilbert Freeman A central and obsessive theme in Edmund Spenser's work (and not just in the Letter to Raleigh) is the allegorical mode itself, as has been widely recognized. His concerns issue from the fact that he sees the signs in his poem as being subject to contradic- tory impulses - toward mobility and toward stasis in terms of meaning. While allegory, as indicated by its etymology ("to mean otherwise"), depends upon a kind of polyvalence or mobility, its comprehensibility depends on strong forms of closure. Although the poet recognizes that "immobilization" of meaning is necessary for the didactic purpose of his allegory, he also realizes that such stability is often achieved at a cost to the suggestive openness of the Faerie Queene's poetry. As signs in the Faerie Queene move alternately toward one of these two poles ("flux" or "stasis"), Spenser seems to see his allegory as "metamorphic," as like the Ovidian phenomenon with its double capacity for both mo- bility and rigidity. While the poet borrows frequently from the Meta- morphoses throughout his epic, at times he uses Ovid's model of literal bodily change specifically as a way of exploring and critiquing the pro- cesses of his own allegory in its most extreme forms. Perhaps the most critical moments where he brings models of metamorphosis into play are the Faunus interlude in the Mutabilitie Cantos and the Malbecco epi- sode (which I discuss below). In these two narratives his interrogations examine quite different aspects of his allegorical making. Although a number of critics have contributed useful scholarship on the intertex- tual relationship between Spenser and Ovid, the connection between metamorphosis and allegory in his poem has yet to be addressed.'

As his only experiment in the genre of the fabliau, a mode eschewing the dilatio and amplifica- tio of the romance form, this episode cuts a curious profile against the shadowy romance sfumato of the Faerie Queene. The poet's appropria- tion of materials from a genre counter to his poem's own is deliberate, for here he is at pains to demonstrate how allegory can transform mat- ter most inimical, reluctant, and external to its desires into allegorical forms.2 In the two opening stanzas, the poet heralds this episode as an alien and potentially disruptive form, included in the epic only for its effect of illumination by contrast: But neuer let th'ensample of the bad Offend the good: for good by paragone Of euill, may more notably be rad, As white seemes fairer macht with blacke attone. Ne all are shamed by the fault of one: For lo in heauen, whereas all goodnesse is, Emongst the Angels, a whole legione Of wicked Sprights did fall from happy bliss; What wonder then, if one of women all did mis? (3.9.2)3 This disclaimer is a bit of a red herring, of course, since the focus of the cantos is less the blackness of Hellenore's sleaziness as it might throw into relief the "whiteness" of examples of chastity than it is the process by which Malbecco is finally rendered a dark and stark allegorical form, cleanly legible against the soft backdrop of the Faerie Queene. Moreover, even though the allegory which turns Malbecco into symbol is an ex- treme or demonic form of Spenser's own mode, it is not a decidedly black force to be exorcised from the white world of the poem. In this context, the poet's judgments are less absolute. He concedes that the Some Ovidian Associations," Comparative Literature 23 (1971): 233-29; Anthony E.

Hamilton (London: Longman, 1977).</page><page sequence="4">310 The Metamorphosis of Malbecco darkness of this species of allegory, which originates in violence and ends in force, is endemic to his own mode. Spenser calls attention to this tale's difference from the romance poem by deploying red flags which signal to the reader that he or she is entering fabliau territory (old man + young wife = cuckold). But the "metamorphosis" of Malbecco and his native mode by allegory begins early in the tale when Spenser subtly rejects the fabliau's typical short- hand style of characterization. What begins as a traditional fabliau cue as to type (jealous husband) will deepen and expand into a fully pa- thetic character as the poet details with rare psychological accuracy exactly how the old man's mind works: But he is old, and withered like hay, Vnfit faire Ladies seruice to supply; The priuie guilt whereof makes him alway Suspect her truth, and keepe continuall spy Vpon her with his other blincked eye; (3.9.5) Spencer's gradual, protracted development of this character's psyche will increase his affect to such a degree that the reader's experience of comedy in the events surrounding him is frustrated. Searching into the "priuie" interiority of his guilt, Spenser dwells on Malbecco's sense of his own inadequacies and deficiencies, owning the shame of the secret that makes him shrink from the glances of others. Malbecco hoards and hides his treasure, his household, his wife, himself in desperate efforts to hold on to things he never truly experiences as his own. The cuckold's identity at the outset seems to be emptied of all substance except his growing fascination with others' happiness, perceived as secrets from which he is excluded. In the self-consuming circuit of his "priuie guilt" (sexual and secret), interior privation makes him fear deprivation at others' hands. Because Spenser explains the genesis of what will be Malbecco's sig- nature sin (envy), he creates both a more sympathetic and a more psy- chologically plausible character than fabliau could ever accommodate. In fact, by yoking envy with fear of privation in his characterization, the poet anticipates modern psychoanalysts who make the same con- nection. Melanie Klein, as one who recognizes aggressive impulses and destructive fantasies from an extremely early stage, argues that envy originates in the infant's sense that he or she has been deprived of de- served gratification. Briefly, envy first appears in the infant who is un- able sufficiently to cathect the breast and so to turn himself into loved</page><page sequence="5">Louise Gilbert Freeman 311 object. When the breast is withheld from the infant, depriving him of gratification, he feels that the frustrating breast keeps its "goodness" for itself.4 Spenser's exploration of the origin and evolution of jealousy, as it deepens Malbecco's humanity and develops a model of the frustrated relation between self and desired object, can elucidate the response of readers to the allegorical symbol. Because so much is opaque, myste- rious, and impenetrable in allegorical writing, the very mode creates what we might term an "envious" response in its readers-the feeling that a form of satisfaction (a secret or a truth) has been withheld from them which they desire to "possess" in concrete terms. Because alle- gorical signs by their very definition do not contain, incarnate, or even directly represent the referent they "name," they naturally recede from the grasp. At the same time, however, they summon continual interpre- tation from their readers by suggesting that comprehension of a truth is possible and that the readers are moving forward toward that goal. When allegory attempts to symbolize transcendent beings or values, divinities or truths, entities which are absent and which have no names, its envious effects are magnified since the reader's comprehension of its symbols must remain imminent, deferred.5 Such signs both solicit and deny interpretation, "come hither" and "not yet," fueling an endless and ardent quest for hermeneutic mastery. When Spenser worries in the Letter to Raleigh about the "jealous opin- ions and misconstructions" that the allegorical mode can provoke, he makes the connection between allegory and envy explicit, and he con- nects the two with the distortions of misreading.6 Likewise, in the poem itself, Malbecco is both jealous cuckold and "gealous" reader.

Hamilton, ed., The Faerie Queene, 737.</page><page sequence="6">312 The Metamorphosis of Malbecco sexual poverty before his wife drives him to "alway suspect her truth" and to hoard her, his cerebral deficiencies make him want to "possess" meaning, to reduce it into concrete forms which he can understand and control. The fable of Malbecco, which at the most literal level serves to prove the maxim "Ne may loue be compeld by maisterie" (3.1.25), demonstrates just as forcefully the failure of an envious hermeneutic which tries to compel meaning into fixed patterns. When interpreting the world, Malbecco attempts to contract all outside realms to the cramped space of his own mind, circumscribed by his narrow obses- sions. His jealous mode is adumbrated by his physical impairment, his "one-eyed" visual aptitude which suggests both an unwavering, single focus and diminished powers of perception: one eye is totally blind and the other is "blincked" (dim) with age. While it clearly evokes the em- blematic "watchful blindness" of jealousy as Nelson suggests this de- fect bespeaks a number of other handicaps, not least of which is herme- neutic.8 More specifically, Malbecco's blurred eyesight becomes a figure for his tropological stupidity-his mind/sight is unable to sustain/per- ceive the dualistic construction (simultaneity of the literal and the figu- rative) on which all metaphor depends. Spenser exploits the difference between perceptual and conceptual knowledge when Malbecco, obses- sively seeking signs of his wife's infidelity, remains blind to the red flags waved before his face: By such close signes they secret way did make Unto their wils, and one eyes watch escape; Two eyes him needeth, for to watch and wake, Who louers will decieue. (3.10.31) Paridell plays at once on the old man's limited imagination and his actual "blincked eye" disability: So perfect in that art was Paridell, That he Malbeccoes halfen eye did wyle, His halfen eye he wiled wondrous well, . . .

A maimed Argus, Mal- becco resolves to watchdog his wife in order to still his fear of loss: Yet warily he watcheth euery way, By which he feareth euill happen may: So th'euill thinkes by watching to preuent; Ne doth he suffer her, nor night, nor day, Out of his sight her selfe once to absent. So doth he punish her and eke himselfe torment. (3.10.3) A mere four stanzas after we are told that Malbecco's eyes are glued to Hellenore, Paridell accosts her, "he sigh'd, he sobd, he swownd, he perdy dyde,. . . he wept, and wayled, and false laments belyde" (3.10.7). Because Paridell keeps "better watch, than hee," Malbecco is always on the lookout, and the lovers are alone as well. Spenser delights in his conceptual geography where Paridell can steal moments with Hel- lenore, "But when apart (if euer apart)"-juxtaposing the world of Mal- becco's resolve with the new, now principal world of adulterous de- signs, a metaphoric mental terrain which for the old man is inaccessible since he is unable to sustain at one time dualistic meanings. Paridell and Hellenore are savvy handlers of language and lore. Hel- lenore is an able reader, shrewdly deciphering the speech-acts that are a part of Paridell's amorous munitions. Seizing each salacious innuendo, she flaunts her appetite for the carnal. Paridell, on the other hand, woos her with a kind of masochistic zeal-the pain of lust that has laid him low so many times before is eagerly embraced. The pantomime of pas- sion is something he mechanically enacts time and time again: And euer and anone, when none was ware, With speaking lookes, that close embassage bore, He rou'd at her, and told his secret care: For all that art he learned had of yore. Ne was she ignoraunt of that lewd lore, But in his eye his meaning wisely red, And with the like him answerd euermore: She sent at him one firie dart, whose hed Empoisned was with priuy lust, and gealous dred. He from that deadly throw made no defence, But to the wound his weake hart opened wyde; The wicked engine through false influence, Past through his eyes, and secretly did glyde</page><page sequence="8">314 The Metamorphosis of Malbecco Into his hart, which it did sorely gryde. But nothing new to him was that same paine, Ne paine at all; for he so oft had tryde The powre thereof, and lou'd so oft in vaine, That thing of course he counted, loue to entertaine. Thenceforth to her he sought to intimate His inward griefe, by means to him well knowne, Now Bacchus fruit out of the siluer plate He on the table dasht, as ouerthrowne, Or of the fruitfull liquor ouerflowne, And by the dauncing bubbles did diuine, Or therein write to let his loue be showne; Which well she red out of the learned line, A sacrament prophane in mistery of wine. And when so of his hand the pledge she raught, The guilty cup she fained to mistake, And in her lap did shed her idle draught, Shewing desire her inward flame to slake: By such close signes they secret way did make Vnto their wils, and one eyes watch escape; Two eyes him needeth, for to watch and wake, Who louers will deceiue. Thus was the ape, By their faire handling, put into Malbecco's cape. (3.9.28-31) The cuckold, intent on possessing meaning, remains blind to informa- tion most crucial to his hunt: if he could read his own name, he would never have married; if he knew the classics, he would never have let his Hellenore in sight of any Paridell; if he remembered the Heroides or the Ars Amatoria, he would have ended his dinner party the moment the wine spilled. Instead, when the young challenge of Paridell mobilizes his belief program, we discover it is a kind of cuckold's creed, a tripar- tite ideefixe: Two things he feared, but the third was death; That fierce youngmans unruly maistery; His money, which he lou'd as liuing breath; And his faire wife, whom honest long he kept vneath. (3.10.2) Spenser quietly infects this odd trinity with a germ of confusion by noting Malbecco's third concern first, so that his roster of values be- gins to revolve around and around, the fixed vertical becoming a kind of whirling vertigo: Malbecco fears death, robbery, and cuckoldry which</page><page sequence="9">Louise Gilbert Freeman 315 equals death. His absurdly sequential, methodical mind leads him to re- duce metaphorical equivalences to literal ones: adultery would be "as death" to him, but for Malbecco this figure of speech has absolute per- formative power. This static, recurrent mode of perception is, of course, dictated by his jealousy and signals his metaphorical illiteracy. However, it also registers his progressive movement from "realistic" character toward allegorical agent. Although psychologically motivated, Malbecco's be- havior becomes so invariable that it retards his potential for growth or development. While Spenser has developed his character far be- yond fabliau dimensions, he has directed it towards a more and more marked distortion of human personality-his character becomes like a victim of a mental disease, a compulsion or fixation, so sick that he has been deprived of any freedom of choice. Angus Fletcher has offered a convincing analogue between allegories and the compulsive syndrome in psychoanalysis, arguing that all allegorical characters, heroes and villains, are monomaniacal and obsessed with teleology.9 In its posi- tive manifestations, this compulsion is a concentration of vision and purpose, such as Britomart's focus on forward direction in her quest. But the "constant" and "steadfast" (3.1.19) qualities of this heroine are merely the propitious flip side of "compulsive" and "fixated"-what Malbecco might have been with a "good-enough" mother, the tutelage of Glauce, or some sessions in psychoanalysis. When Hellenore sets fire to the old man's cash and elopes with Pari- dell, Spenser depicts the shattering of his mental model through a pa- thetic image of his "froward" longings, pulling him hopelessly in all di- rections: The wretched man hearing her call for ayd, And readie seeing him with her to fly, In his disquiet mind was much dismayd: But when againe he backward cast his eye, And saw the wicked fire so furiously Consume his hart, and scorch his Idoles face, He wist not how to turne, nor to what place; Was neuer wretched man in such a wofull cace. Ay when to him she cryde, to her he turnd, And left the fire; loue money ouercame: But when he marked, how his money burnd, 9 Angus Fletcher, Allegory: The Theory of a Symbolic Mode (Ithaca, NY: Comell University Press, 1964).</page><page sequence="10">316 The Metamorphosis of Malbecco He left his wife; money did loue disclame: Both was he loth to loose his loued Dame, And loth to leaue his liefest pelfe behind, Yet sith he n'ote saue both, he sau'd that same, Which was the dearest to his donghill mind, The God of his desire, the ioy of misers blind. (3.10.14-15) The serial order of his obsessions becomes scrambled, and, where once there were three clear goals in his life, now "ten thousand wayes he cast in his confused thought" (3.10.18). When faced with his novel and daunting freedom of choice, logical thought fails him completely. Fix- ating upon the absent member of his stormed triad, Hellenore, Mal- becco makes her the cynosure of all his obsessions. When the "cancred crabbed Carle," is forced to leave the "priuitie" of his castle to search for Hellenore, he encounters the larger world, a world from which he feels radically alienated. Because it remains "other" to himself and his desires, he experiences an angst which he both denies and compensates for by trying to make the world outside correspond to his self, to shrink its dimensions to the size of his psychopathic mind. Unlike Donne, who endows his stanzas ("pretty rooms" and private microcosms) with a new, richly imagined cosmos built on analogies to the big world, Mal- becco deforms what exists to mirror his paltry inner self. Gordon Teskey, in his important recent book on allegory, argues that the desire to master the world, to reduce the world to a form that can be contained within the self, is intrinsic to the mode itself.'0 Taking for granted a disjunction between its referent and its signs, allegory as "other" (allo) "speaking" (agoria) creates dual spheres that are incom- mensurable with each other, the material and the ideal. While the intent of allegory at some level is to conceal the gap between the two, it always in fact underscores the separation. Malbecco, forcing all meanings into an allegorical mold, tries to make them into signs of she who is absent. Hellenore becomes transcendental Other to Malbecco, single and in- visible, so that everything he sees is subsumed by her image. Spenser's transsexual trick of perspective in stanza 21 demonstrates the tyranny of Malbecco's new allegorical vision. It downloads Hellenore's image onto a knight, overwriting even his gender: One day, as he forpassed by the plaine With weary pace, he farre away espide 10 Gordon Teskey, Allegory and Violence (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1996), 6- 8.</page><page sequence="11">Louise Gilbert Freeman 317 A couple, seeming well to be his twaine, Which houed close vnder a forrest side, As if they lay in wait, or else themselues did hide. Well weened he, that those the same mote bee, And as he better did their shape auize, Him seemed more their manner did agree; For th'one was armed all in warlike wize, Whom, to be Paridell he did deuize; And th'other all yclad in garments light, Discolour'd like to womanish disguise, He did resemble to his Ladie bright; And euer his faint hart much earned at the sight. (3.10.20-21) When Malbecco mistakes Braggadocchio and Trompart for Paridell and Hellenore, it is not a failure of eyesight, but rather a new vision in which the presence of Hellenore resides in all objects, persons, and settings, yet never manifests itself completely. Her flight has led Malbecco out into the world to search for her, but the symbolic presence she has achieved in his mind leads him always back away from the world to what he believes the world figures. For Malbecco, the world has become a mere trope for what stands behind it. The quest has a petty analogue in his halfen vision which sees all in terms of its diminished symbol. Malbecco's desire "priuily" to own Hellenore echoes, of course, an insistent theme of the larger Legend of Chastity-the quest for posses- sion which Pat Parker has suggestively described." Earlier in book 3, Britomart, smitten by Artegall, half envies the shady characters Myrrhe, Biblis, and Pasiphae from Ovid's poem, because they possessed their beloveds with a bird-in-the-hand, total gratification: For they, howeuer shamefull and vinkind, Yet did possesse their horrible intent: Short end of sorrow they thereby did find; So was their fortune good, though wicked were their mind. (3.2.43) Likewise, in the Garden of Adonis, the poet provides the salutary con- cept that Venus "possesseth" Adonis "when euer that she will" (3.6.46) as an antidote to the characteristic strain of the romance mode, the pos- sible endlessness of its quests, deferrals, and errors. And yet, almost always such "cures" for the waiting game turn out to be short-sighted 11 Patricia Parker, Inescapable Romance (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1979), 87-101.</page><page sequence="12">318 The Metamorphosis of Malbecco and reductive. This rule of thumb extends to the poem's hermeneutics as well. "Possession" of meaning, like the "possession" of love ("May her perhaps containe" [3.9.71) requires a kind of "timely seruice," a period of waiting in dubiety, in ambivalence, if it is to be achieved at all. The tension between these opposites, varieties of fixity and flux, structures nearly every narrative in book 3 and serves to guide their interpre- tation. In the Malbecco episode, Spenser dramatizes the possessive drive of his own allegory as it overwhelms Malbecco at the end of his tale. With a predatory teleology, it tracks the cuckold in his course, pens him, and draws him up into a single symbol, a mono-meaning (Gealosie). When the poem's "gealous" allegory seizes this jealous allegorical reader near the end of the episode, violently deforming him into an emblem, it is with a chilling and inexorable logic of punishment close to the contra- passo of Dante. Despite the apparent symmetry of crime and penalty, however, Spenser's treatment of him seems excessively harsh, even sa- distic. Whereas other "bad" readers in the poem, bunglers like Red- crosse after the defeat of Errour or Britomart after the House of Busi- rane, are reformed in a kind of copious, invisible study hall adjacent to the poem, Malbecco is brutally punished. Unleashing his allegory's most radical energies on the passive old fool, Spenser at the same time remains keenly sensitive to the illogic of victimization. The poet's lucid moral condemnation of Malbecco is mingled with a kind of pathos and understanding of his injured psyche. We can de- tect a wry compassion for the cuckold in the text, a compassion not un- mixed with the grotesque. In the scene in which he witnesses the satyrs exchanging Hellenore like a worn coin, Malbecco's earlier equation of her with money is cruelly realized. And although his mind tends to blur all contours into the imagined form of his one symbol (Hellenore), he develops a complementary obsession with detail, counting as a satyr achieves orgasm nine times: At night, when all they went to sleepe, he vewd, Whereas his louely wife emongst them lay, Embraced of a Satyre rough and rude, Who all the night did minde his ioyous play: Nine times he heard him come aloft ere day, That all his hart with gealousie did swell; But yet that nights ensample did bewray, That not for nought his wife them loued so well, When one so oft a night did ring his matins bell. (3.19.48)</page><page sequence="13">Louise Gilbert Freeman 319 The descriptions of the voyeur's anguish register real empathy with his grief. The strategic connection of Malbecco to pathos is in essence what grants his terminal form of Gealosie the power to signify so force- fully. The resultant abstraction takes from humanity, from the realm of beings, a kind of substantial materiality which vitalizes it. And yet Spenser's intent in uncovering the process through which this human character becomes symbol is to gauge the tremendous cost of this achievement. The deeply antithetical nature of the moment is affirmed by the pathos Malbecco achieves when he leaves human experience be- hind. In creating a figure so resonantly human and then abstracting and renaming him, the poet brazenly reveals how violent is the operation of allegory, how dark its origins, how overreaching its hunger. In a distinctly Ovidian sequence, Malbecco moves from the human to the abstract, taking on a series of forms before his final allegorical incar- nation. Spenser lingers in his account, describing each phase in excruci- ating, gratuitous detail. He displays allegory's drive toward an absolute coincidence of sign with meaning as each change gives concrete form to a commonplace metaphor about cuckoldry or jealousy. When Mal- becco sees Hellenore among the herds of satyrs, rhetoric and literality begin to merge: Which when Malbecco saw, out of his bush Vpon his hands and feete he crept full light, And like a Gote emongst the Gotes did rush, That through the helpe of his faire hornes on hight, And misty dampe of misconceiuing night, And eke through likeness of his gotish beard, He did the better counterfeite aright: So home he marcht emongst the horned herd, That none of all the Satyres him espyed or heard. (3.10.47) Still retaining vestiges of the human, Malbecco takes on material at- tributes of the goat, the cuckold's symbolic counterpart.'2 Since Pari- dell's arrival, Malbecco has worn the metaphorical horns of the cuck- old, but now the figurative horns have become real. While he creeps 12 A seventeenth-century text suggests that "The goat is often likened to the betrayed husband in that both are horned ("cornuti") and in that the cuckold is, like the goat, tol- erant of or even grateful for having his wife used by other men in his presence." The Horn Exalted. Or, Room for Cuckolds (London: i661). Another etymology suggests that the word "Beccho" (i.e., cuckold or goat) derived from Bacchus, a god with horns, whose female devotees grafted horns on their husbands' heads, desiring them to appear as bulls.</page><page sequence="14">320 The Metamorphosis of Malbecco "like a Gote" and has "likeness" to a goat due to his "gotish beard," the simile is hammered home so many times that, in the reader's mind, he becomes visually equivalent to it. Each successive phase of his "meta- morphosis" is actually the suspension of a metaphoric prospect on him. Each trope, which is meant to provide a provisional and temporary out- look on the character, is momentarily arrested and subsumed by a ma- terialized image. One of the paradoxes of this episode is that Malbecco can be said to change and yet not to change at all. Paul Alpers cleverly observes that his transformation is "not a change in him, but a terrible remaining who he is."'3 Indeed there is a sense in which he is violently changed, not into a new species, but into an eternally frigid and unchanging as- pect of himself. But Spenser creates a dynamic illusion of change and movement by having his form evolve through a series of metaphors in order to bear witness to the power of the poem's linguistic transfor- mations. By the end of the canto, Malbecco has mutated from an old man "who could not fly" (43) to a "nimble"-footed, goat-like, practically airborne creature (are "winges" in 55 metaphorical or literal?) rushing through these stanzas in a reeling blur. The bear simile of 53, which so cruelly trivializes Malbecco's experience in the woods, becomes incor- porated into our evolving image of Malbecco and the deformations of his shape. Dizzied by his flight from wood through hills and dales over banks and under bushes, we follow him to a "rockie hill, / Ouer the sea, suspended dreadfully" (3.10.56) from whence he will drift down to a cliff-hung cave. This interval of pause aptly externalizes Malbecco's inward state, always frozen fearfully between two malignant alterna- tives ("That liuing creature it would terrify, / To look adowne or upward to the hight"), and it also seems to describe what is often the poem's position, suspended between tensions. Spenser recurrently evokes this sense of pendancy in the Faerie Queene, in alternately negative and posi- tive terms. At times, as in the opening lines of 1.2, the poem seems able to achieve a kind of steadfast-but-moving equipoise: By this the Northerne wagoner had set His seuenfold teme behind the stedfast starre, That was in Ocean waues yet neuer wet, But firme is fixt, and sendeth light from farre To all, that in the wide deepe wandring arre: 13 Paul Alpers, The Poetry of the "Faerie Queene "(Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1982), 389.</page><page sequence="15">Louise Gilbert Freeman 321 Parker implies a complex of terms of suspension ("suspended," "pen- dant," "pensive," and "penseroso") in Milton's work which could also resonate in Spenser's poem. "Suspension," she suggests, provides a subtle link between the suspended threshold of romance (with its spiri- tual and narrative irresolution) and the more perilous place of eternal suspension, Dante's Limbo.'4 When in stanza 54 Spenser describes Mal- becco's demeanor with 'vpstart haire, and staring eyes dismay, / From Limbo lake him late escaped sure would say," he associates him with a region of exile which belongs to the poem too, with its pendant or pend- ing program of signification. Malbecco is a masterfully confused mingling of possibilities. The mo- ment before his leap, he is full of centrifugal directions for his final in- carnation: he could become a scorned goat, an Ovidian bird-creature, or an emblem of one of the psychological states that pursue him: "Griefe, and despight, and gealosie, and scorne" (3.10.55). Subjected to such a myriad of comparisons, his identity, it seems, is eternally poised for change. This Ovidian protraction of the transformation, with its star- tling twists and cruel distortions, conflicts in some sense with what Angus Fletcher would call the "compulsive teleology" of the allegory in this episode, the force that moves Malbecco so swiftly and relentlessly toward the bleached zone of abstraction. This drive toward closure is typically linear, unswerving in its focus on end. In this wild prelude to the final change, however, Spenser reveals the strenuous contortions, linguistic and phenomenological, that lie beneath allegory's surface movement. Each of Spenser's new metaphors provides a new visual image of the man, decomposing and superseding the one before, forcing the metamorphosis. Spenser here imitates the narratives from the Metamorphoses in which the material form of the victim's body is pushed into a process whereby the body, in phases, takes on new shapes, each literalizing some meta- phorical identification that the poet is making until the victim becomes fixed, visually, semantically, and ontologically in a terminal form: numen confessis aliquod patet: ultima certe vota suos habuere deos.

For even as she spoke the earth closed over her legs; roots burst forth from her toes and stretched out on either side the supports of the high trunk; her bones gained strength, and, while the cental pith remained the same, her blood changed to sap, her arms to long branches, her fingers to twigs, her skin to hard bark. And now the growing tree had closely bound her heavy womb, had buried her breast and was just covering her neck; but she could not endure the delay and, meeting the rising wood, she sank down and plunged her face into the bark. Though she has lost her old-time feelings with her body, still she weeps, and the warm drops trickle down from the tree. Even the tears have fame, and the myrrh which dis- tils from the tree-trunk keeps the name of its mistress and will be remembered through the ages.] (10.490)15 The process of metamorphosis in Ovid's poem, in which bodies are re- duced to their most base material components, stresses that all forms are susceptible to mutability and that identity fluctuates. The victim's final, eternal, and often fossilized form, by contrast, suggests the oppo- site-that metamorphosis is a paradigm of fixed identity or "end." At some point, the tree, the stream, the stone, the flower become one with the name and being of Myrrha, Arethusa, Niobe, Narcissus. In becom- ing fixed and apparently "permanent," these figures attain a kind of tex- tual power. They are performative, authoritative, forcefully illusionistic in the Metamorphoses when they become monitory monuments to their crimes, sufferings, or punishments. Full comprehension of the figures in Ovid's poem, however, must recognize that their power to signify in the text derives from their confiscation of matter from living forms. Conceptual power is achieved only at the cost of the figure's former humanity, humanity which is both invisible and integral to the new forms. Like the monumental forms in Ovidian metamorphosis, allegorical 15 Ovid, Metamorphoses, ed. and trans. Frank Justus Miller, 2 vols. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, i916).</page><page sequence="17">Louise Gilbert Freeman 323 names and images are also poetic signs which have been seized from a state of semantic flux, from the transient realm of metaphor, and pro- jected as reified, immutable objects. Stephen Barney, for one, argues that what differentiates the reified, allegorical figure from metaphor is its persistence in the fiction: Metaphors are temporary phenomena in a fiction: visible in them is the deliber- ate decision by a narrator or character to assert a comparison, which can prove wrong or go away at will ... but personifications and symbols are not, like meta- phors, meditations upon fictional characters, objects, and events. Once posited, they are inalienable if continuity is preserved.16 When a palpable thing (res) poses in place of an abstraction, the con- crete and the abstract merge in a single term which permanently af- fects the nature of the literal itself. Spenser, of course, luxuriates in the temporality of metaphoric language in his many rich descriptive pas- sages in the Faerie Queene. Part of the power of the poetic is, of course, its openness and fluidity. However, this aspect of his poetry often comes into conflict with the didactic purposes which his allegory serves and which allegory is only able to achieve by a sacrifice of the poetic. In evoking Ovidian metamorphosis in the context of Malbecco's transfor- mation into a symbol, Spenser draws a parallel between the processes in order to measure the cost of achieving a fixed meaning. In Spenser's metamorphosis of the cuckold, the bravura of the lit- erary performance temporarily suppresses the tale's emotive effects; the shifting, metaphorical operation of the poem's language becomes coldly estranged from Malbecco as character. In order to demonstrate the logical coincidences between Malbecco's form and its various con- ceptual abstractions, Spenser's allegory coldly violates it. In this epi- sode tropes materialize and offer themselves as substitutes for the human, revealing how allegory often breaches the integrity of charac- ters and objects. Malbecco, losing the human, becomes confused with the animal, spectacularly "monstrous" in Girardian terms ("an unstable hallucination that, in retrospect, crystallizes into stable forms, owing to the fact that it is remembered in a world that has regained stability").17 The final form that inheres visually in our minds is a recollection of various creaturely elements ("winges," "upstart hair," "claws," "aery 16 Stephen Barney, Allegories of History, Allegories of Love (Hamden, CT: Archon Books, 1979), 28. 17 Rene Girard, The Scapegoat, trans.

As Malbecco fails to hang on to his human shape, he transmutes and joins company with freakish hybrids like Duessa with her fox's tail, eagle's claw, and bear's paw. Teskey, whose work shares with my project an emphasis on the essen- tially violent activity of allegorical making, observes that "each object on which this [allegorical] force is exerted belongs to a realm that is in- tolerably 'other' before it is raised to the position of the transcenden- tal 'other.' "18 Allegory wrests the object from its natural orientation in the order of things and breaks it down into confused, multiple compo- nents (the raw material of allegory). Spenser dramatizes this operation as Malbecco is defamiliarized and dehumanized, driven to the outer edge of identifiability before he can be seized, drawn up, and raised into a hierarchical emblem. Rather than disguising the violence of these maneuvers, Spenser reveals, even emphasizes it, as the character is stripped of his humanity and turned into mere elemental matter, source for symbol making. As Spenser's allegory makes Gealosie from Malbecco, we observe how the symbol appropriates his substance, empties him out. When this creature arrives at topography's edge, a cliff in a sinister landscape, he attempts to destroy his mutant and mutating body to bring an end to change: But through long anguish, and selfe-murdring thought He was so wasted and forpined quight, That all his substance was consum'd to nought, And nothing left, but like an aery Spright That on the rockes he fell so flit and light; That he thereby receiv'd no hurt at all; (3.10.57) Allegory, having "consumed to naught" his "substance," has brought him near to the substantive he will become-an emblem of Gealosie-as he wafts in his descent like a loose sheet of paper. Having no human- ity, no body to tempt death's carnal hunger, he lands on a cliff where he gains partial reanimation, crawling into a cave with "crooked clawes," newly added bestial appendages. The final image of Malbecco is vio- lently conflicted; he lives eternally in his damned state, eternally wish- ing for death: 18 Teskey, Allegory and Violence, 6.</page><page sequence="19">Louise Gilbert Freeman 325 Yet can he neuer dye, but dying liues, And doth himselfe with sorrow new sustaine, That death and life attonce vnto him giues. And painfull pleasure turns to pleasing paine. There dwels he euer, miserable swaine, Hateful both to him selfe, and euery wight; Where he through priuy griefe, and horrour vaine, Is woxen so deform'd that he has quight Forgot he was a man, and Gealosie is hight. (3.10.60) The final stanza turns on oxymorons which suggest his radically sun- dered existence. Not merely other to his readers or to the poem, he has become other to himself ("him selfe"). The contraries which divide him are so polarized that they create a kind of symmetry of struggle from which allegory takes him in the last line. Spenser underscores the lin- guistic nature of the change in the last word of the canto, "hight," which designates both Malbecco's name and his new ontological status as an abstraction. Allegory projects his meaning in one name, one voice, one essence. Malbecco is turned into an eternal monument to his crime, suffer- ing, and punishment that others may observe, just like the terminal forms in Ovid's landscape. In the Metamorphoses, these final figures of the transformations-rocks, flowers, trees-gain an illusion of an epis- temologically fixed presence which, of course, is deceptive. The irrevo- cable Ovidian forms attempt to disguise what is in fact their arbitrary status; originating in the transformations of metaphorical language, each is merely a single metaphorical prospect on the subject which has been arrested and projected in a fixed form, as Paul de Man observes: [Anthropomorphism] is no longer a proposition but a proper name, as when the metamorphosis in Ovid's stories culminates and halts in the singleness of a proper name, Narcissus or Daphne or whatever. Far from being the same, tropes such as metaphor (or metonomy) and anthropomorphisms are mutually exclusive. The apparent enumeration is in fact a foreclosure which acquires, by the same token, considerable critical power.19 As the tree is made one with the name and being of Myrrha in Ovid, claiming for itself an illusion of permanence, in Spenser the erected allegorical sign, Gealosie, appears to be a fixed, permanent, unalterable 19 Paul de Man, "Anthropomorphism and Trope in Lyric," The Rhetoric of Romanticism (New York: Columbia University Press, 1984), 241.</page><page sequence="20">326 The Metamorphosis of Malbecco form, suggesting both its power (permanency) and its penalty (ossifica- tion). But where Ovid seems to delight in the illusionistic force of these forms, Spenser is troubled by their power, by their apparent achieve- ment of permanence because they seem to invite reductive interpre- tations. When, in the Faerie Queene, Spenser assigns to people, places, or things identities (nominal or visual) that seem to define their essence, he tends to immobilize the process of meaning as the name or image brings entities into existence from a content whose presence is fixed in the minds of all persons by experience. But this movement toward stabilization of figure and concept is attended by the danger that it im- plies a strict identity between the sign and referent which allegory, by its very nature, denies. If the allegorical name or image implies by its firmness and clarity that a final truth or idea has been asserted and unveiled, it can never be more than a crystallized trope, a poetic sign which has moved from a kind of semantic flux (where meaning is pro- visionally defined by the processes of substitution, analogy, and meta- phorical transformation) to a kind of semantic fixity-a single trope. Spenser characteristically tempts his readers with stable positions of mastery of experience (and of the poem's images), only to reveal that such sites are more likely opportunities for error as the evolutionary movement of the poem often unravels the identifications. The poem's readers learn through continual shifts in the relation of knowledge and ignorance, discovering the poem's meanings through various acts of displacement. This is, in fact, our experience in the first stanza of the canto following Malbecco's change, for here Spenser constructs a new image of jealousy, situating us once again in the world of ambiguous signs. Already Gealosie has begun again to change form: O Hatefull hellish Snake, what furie furst Brought thee from balefull house of Proserpine, Where in her bosome she thee long had nurst, And fostered vp with bitter milke of tine, Fowle Gealousie, that turnest loue diuine To joyless dread, and mak'st the louing hart With hatefull thoughts to languish and to pine, And feed it selfe with selfe-consuming smart? Of all the passions in the mind thou vilest art. (3.11.1) This subtle metamorphosis of the emblem comes to us as a sign that the poem has been resuscitated, that it has begun to dilate again by repeti- tion and reversal.</page><page sequence="21">Louise Gilbert Freeman 327 While the renaming of Malbecco as Gealosie, static, depersonalized, stylized emblem, boasts an absolute objectification of the vice, this sec- ond name cannot-in all its tidy, distilled abstractness-erase its dis- orderly human history. Even though Spenser has gradually withdrawn the character from pathetic identification in the process of his metamor- phosis, we can never read the current name without seeing behind it the former one. Just as the label inscribed above the poet's head (Malfont) in 5.6 can never hide the former imprint (BON FONT), Gealosie fails to overwrite completely its human lineage. If Malbecco "Forgot he was a man," his readers do not, and as we re-member him, his affect is raised to a higher plane. Gealosie, like so many figures in the Faerie Queene, is an allegorical personification that dissipates its own mode by remind- ing us of the cost of its creation. In revealing in this episode the vio- lent process through which the emblem is created, Spenser invites us to read backward, to de-symbolize this emblem into its human origin. In always remembering Malbecco as man in our apprehension of Gealosie, we become aware that the symbol, born out of a kind of chaos, must continue to shuttle back and forth between realms, human and concep- tual, material and ideal, in order to signify. We must know jealousy as man must know forms-humanized as adversary or ally, at once other and mirrored self. Allegory depends upon a separation of terms just as metamorphosis always requires an alienation of terms, mind and body. In connecting these two processes, Spenser confesses that violence and violation drive them both, a disturbing admission. Like a victim from one of Ovid's narratives of capture, rape, and deformation, Malbecco is deprived of unity and vitality in his metamorphosis into symbol. Allegory seizes this character's materiality and divests it of its human particularity to create its abstractions. Spenser exaggerates what his contemporaries like Puttenham had identified allegory's modus operandi-an exercise of force which violates language's "natural" order: But properly and in his principall vertue Allegoria is when we do speake in sense translative and wrested from the owne [i.e., "proper"] signification, neverthe- less applied to another not altogether contrary, but having much conveniencie with it.... 20 Allegory aggressively 'wrests" an object or being and forces it, square peg, into the new, round, symbolical form of the allegorical sign. Spen- ser creates an extreme form of his own allegory in order to teach us 20 George Puttenham, The Arte of English Poesie (London, 1589), ed.

Like Teskey, I see Spenser as a poet courageous enough to "draw back the veil of an opti- mistic, metaphysical illusion to reveal the truth of its origin and the cer- tainty of its undoing."2' The Malbecco episode is not the only site in the Faerie Queene where Spenser explores modes of assimilative aggression which reflect on his allegory. Perhaps as striking is the place in book 6 where cannibals take Malbecco's darker compulsions (envy, fear of deprivation, desire for an other) and realize them in more primitive terms. If the old man was "jealous" as allegorical reader of the world, absorbing it by drawing the multiple into the one, the overarching symbol of Hellenore (Helen O'er all the world), the cannibals try to bring the world into the control of the self by another means. After stripping the maiden and dividing her garments "amongst them" communally, the cannibals experience mi- metic desire which triggers envy and competitiveness. They fragment Serena's body into digestible, component parts-blason metaphors- before they actually attempt to devour her: Now being naked, to their sordid eyes The goodly threasures of nature appeare: Which as they view with lustfull fantasyes, Each wisheth to him selfe, and to the rest enuyes. Her yuorie necke, her alabaster brest, Her paps, which like white silken pillowes were, For loue in soft delight thereon to rest; Her tender sides, her bellie white and clere, Which like an Altar did it selfe vprere, To offer sacrifice diuine thereon; Her goodly thighes, whose glorie did appeare Like a triumphall Arch, and thereupon The spoiles of Princes hang'd, which were in battel won. (6.8.41-42) Spenser conflates the cannibal imagination with the blason in order to register how poetic language can become voracious, perverted, de- structive in its most radical process. When not controlled, metaphors can become cannibalistic, as anthropologist Stanley Walens suggests: The process of analogizing has to be controlled, for just as any process needs to be kept from swallowing everything, analogies need to be kept from assimilat- ing everything.... The power of metaphor to create must be measured against 21 Teskey, Allegory and Violence, 31.</page><page sequence="23">Louise Gilbert Freeman 329 its power to destroy. The drawing of distinctions offsets the collapsing of dis- tinctions.22 As Walens describes it, transformation for cannibals is important not as how one thing is like another (and therefore not the same as the other), but as one thing is another, as it has become another thing by being eaten by it. The anthropologist argues that orality really serves the cannibal culture as a model of the poetic process of constructing metaphors- one symbol becomes like another by assimilating the nature of the other symbol within itself: Metaphors, like humans, animals, and spirits, become each other by incorpo- rating an old substance within a new skin, by putting a mask on it, thus giving it a new body, a new shape, a new identity on the outside while it retains its old identity on the inside. For the Kwakiutl, a metaphor is a transformation, just as a transformation is a metaphor?3 Allegory, as both the most permanent and performative of all tropes, not only assimilates, but attempts to make its transformations irrevers- ible. If metaphorical masks can be donned and doffed in an extended train, in which each new semblance with a wily finger points to the dis- guise, indicating the pretense, allegory is the instrument which incor- porates one of these fleeting illusions into the figure itself and projects it as an eternal form. While all metaphors oscillate, shuttling between self and world, measuring the gap between the two alienated terms, alle- gory tends to conceal this hiatus. Spenser's interrogations into his allegory as underlying network are risky and potentially invite a crisis of representation. There is a tempta- tion, therefore, to read episodes like the Malbecco or cannibal segments as demonic anti-types of the poem's own mode. Certainly, in light of the sadism of 3.10, the goatish Malbecco could be seen to serve the poem as ritual scapegoat, a figure who bears on his head all the collective sins of the poem, but Spenser more complexly teaches us about how his own allegory regularly participates in such a stereotype of persecution, and while he may attempt to avoid such extreme forms of allegory, he ac- knowledges them as his own.24 If he brandishes poetic justice in pos- sessing a jealous man with a jealous mode of allegory, he perpetrates the very sin he seems to condemn, acknowledging its compulsory role 22 Stanley Walens, Feasting with Cannibals (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1981), 68. 23 Walens, Feasting with Cannibals, i8. 24 Girard, Scapegoat, 33.</page><page sequence="24">330 The Metamorphosis of Malbecco in the creation of allegory. Likewise, although the cannibals of the Ser- ena episode might seem to be the "other," alien and adversarial to the civilized self of the poet, Spenser creates them as a type of lyric poet, lit- erate and sophisticated, to demonstrate the proximity of their primitive forms of aggression to his own poetic mode. Such self-critical episodes dramatize the poem's vulnerability to the "gealous opinions and misconstructions" he mentioned in the Letter to Raleigh, and they also uncover its complicity in the process of mis- prision. Because part of the pleasure of the Faerie Queene is in its gen- eration of the more open kinds of signs that invite specific misread- ings, allegory is essentially a didactic countermand. The poet's sense of moral responsibility in these issues is weighty. Throughout the Faerie Queene, he uneasily vacillates among his tools, worrying about the po- tential of each to deform and misguide, interrogating his instruments in order to teach us how to read his dark conceits. They are both concrete and abstract, inside nature and transcending it, specific and blurred, strictly determined and yet destined to explode into chaos exterior to the poem. Through these lessons, Spenser is essentially teaching us how to live with and within our antithetical natures, human and spiritual, mutable and abiding. It is because Spenser accepts and explores the contradictions of his own poetry that the Faerie Queene endures as the strenuous, profitable, creative work that it is.
