<plain_text><page sequence="1">THOMAS MANN'S CANINE IDYL FRANK X. BRAUN University of Michigan During the First World War, Thomas Mann composed two short pieces of idyllic literature depicting an indoors and an out-of-doors aspect of his domestic life on the outskirts of Munich. The interior idyl, written in hexameters, centers around the latest arrival in the Mann nursery, while the exterior idyl, in prose form, deals chiefly with the habits and character of a dog by the name of Bauschan. Critical re- action to this narrative, entitled "Herr und Hund," is on the whole characterized by a marked note of reserve, which found a rather accurate reflection in Henry Hatfield's cryptic remark: "Experts in canine psy- chology have maintained that the dog Bashan is admirably drawn."' Hatfield's non-committal statement about Thomas Mann's dog story is not only symptomatic of the general critical attitude toward modern animal literature, but it also hints at the underlying reason for this phenomenon, the explanation of which is to be looked for in the specific nature of the subject matter. Modern animal literature, born in the late nineteenth century as the offspring of belles lettres and the natural sci- ences, has among its creators and subsequent masters chiefly men of both literary talent and scientific training. Literary critics, therefore, in order to deal authoritatively with writings about animals are of necessity ex- pected to be more or less versed in animal behavior and animal psy- chology. The absence of such specialized insight, it would seem, accounts for the peculiar nature of critical reactions to Thomas Mann's canine idyl, which range from judicious reserve on the part of most critics to expert opinions by a few and uncritical enthusiasm by others. The judgments of both experts and enthusiasts have gone unchallenged so far. If the definitive statement ringing with authority may be used as an indicator, then there are at least two critics who must be considered as experts on animal literature. One of them, H. G. Scheffauer, who rendered the idyl into English in 1923, introduces the narrative in super- lative terms. It is, according to him, "one of the most subtle and pene- trating studies of the psychology of the dog that has ever been written." ' The second critic, Martin Havenstein, author of a significant book on Thomas Mann's works, specifically compares Mann with internationally recognized writers in the field of animal literature such as Ernest Thomp- son Seton, Lans, and Fleuron. In Mann's dog story Havenstein lauds particularly its objectivity and realism - both of which are, of course, essential characteristics distinguishing modern animal literature from its less naturalistic literary antecedents. With considerable enthusiasm Havenstein arrives at the conclusion that Thomas Mann's very first 1 Henry Hatfield, Thomas Mann (New York, 1951), p. 80. 2 Herman G.

Among the enthusiasts Heinrich Meyer-Benfey praises in what he terms "die genaueste und liebevollste Studie, die jemals einem gewohn- lichen Hund . . . gewidmet ist," the objective portraiture of Bauschan's physiological and psychological make-up. He characterizes Mann's style as purely descriptive and free from all philosophizing and anthropomor- phisms. Indeed, he goes so far as to see in this dog story an important turning point in Thomas Mann's literary production.' Jenny Ballou, on the other hand, does not deny but admires the anthropomorphic aspects of the narrative in which Mann "attributes convincingly enough to his dog the reactions of a sane, proud, loving person." " An anonymous reviewer finds that Thomas Mann, the "Austrian writer," gives him "an almost uncanny glimpse into the mentality of not only Baushan him- self, but of all those four-legged friends of ours whom he so delight- fully typifies." 6 In a similarly enthusiastic vein Franz Herwig proclaims "Herr und Hund" as the ultimate in dog-stories, "so ganz Hundege- schichte, daB man meint, den Hund als solchen vorher iiberhaupt noch nicht gekannt zu haben." Abstaining from value judgments for the time being, let it be said that Mann's narrative style in "Herr und Hund" has much in common with that of the masters of modern animal literature. * They employ, above all, acutely developed powers of perception and, in keeping with their scientific training, are reliable and often highly articulate reporters of observable reality. Similarly Thomas Mann, though not a naturalist by training or inclination, is endowed with unusual perceptive faculties. Indeed, he is perhaps most reliable when, in the role of purely objective reporter, he describes and brings to life this unique individual, Bauschan, the mongrel dog, and at his best when he discloses with a delightful note of restrained humor, with tolerance and gentle irony Bauschan's somewhat beclouded and, from a purist point of view, highly question- able ancestry. Maudlin sentimentality that often mars dog stories is happily absent in this narrative. On the other hand, there is ample evidence of genuine, but always slightly ironic empathy. The latter is a Martin Havenstein, Thomas Mann.

Such passages in Thomas Mann's dog story easily rank among the best descriptive prose in German animal literature. One last and most important question needs to be answered before assigning to Mann a place of honor among the masters, old and new, of German animal fiction. Is he fully aware of and does he respect the limits of human insight into the animal psyche? According to Haven- stein, he is indeed strictly bound by these limits and does not permit himself to wander off into the tempting realm of anthropocentric in- tuition and assumption (Havenstein, p. 308). This claim, if substantiated, would signify that Thomas Mann, successfully avoiding all anthropo- morphic pitfalls, attained what amounts to immediate mastery in his first venture into a new literary genre. Without assuming the role of an "expert in canine psychology," I can perhaps best scrutinize Haven- stein's above contention, also subscribed to by other critics, by applying to Mann's canine narrative criteria, the validity of which is generally accepted in the realm of animal fiction. Beginning with Ernest Thompson Seton and up to the present day, critics and writers of animal literature have been in agreement on what constitutes excellence and genuineness in the genre. A contemporary critic, Ivan T. Sanderson, has perhaps best articulated the professed ideal in his definition of the objective and realistic animal tale which, at its best, is told "entirely from the animal's point of view, but in our language and through our mental formulae and which, in the best ex- amples, compounds all we know of the habits, behavior and outlook of the animals." " Did Thomas Mann actually measure up to this standard which only very few writers of the genre attained and even these only occasionally? It is more than doubtful, in my opinion, that Mann aspired to the scientific accuracy which Havenstein and others needlessly insist on ascribing to him. For, upon closer analysis, it is not the strict adherence to the established body of facts of canine psychology that bestows on Mann's narrative the mark of literary distinction. Quite the contrary seems to be true. It is rather his wizardry with words, images, and symbols, his uncanny power of articulation that evoke in the reader the illusion of the expert and authoritative statement. In actuality, there are only very few instances when Thomas Mann assumes the stance of authority, 10 and even then he does so needlessly, for he is much more SIvan T.

One outstanding example is Thomas Mann's application of human typology to members of the canine family. He all but succeeds in per- suading us that, for instance, Nietzsche's dictum that the position of a being in the hierarchy of reality is in direct proportion to its capacity to endure suffering, holds true also for canines. Undemonstrable and utterly unscientific as it may sound, Thomas Mann nevertheless carries out this bold transmutation with convincing assurance, and specifically by means of a subtle technique of interpretive and suggestive description. Bauschan, we are told initially, is nothing but a healthy, normal, and unproblematical specimen of mixed doghood. But slowly and nearly ilnperceptibly the qualities ascribed to the dog assume anthropological undertones, when such terms as "Biedersinn," "die Minnlichkeit seines moralischen Teiles," "Wackerkeit und virile Tugend," "biurisches Jiger- blut" (p. 206 f.) creep in until, a few pages later, Bauschan quite con- vincingly assumes the mental image of, and is actually termed a "Jiger- bursche," in brief, a personification of human normalcy, health, and virility. All but calling this dog "blonde and blue-eyed," Mann con- fronts him, employing his favorite antithetical technique, with Percy, the neurotic canine from the novel Kinigliche Hoheit. Comparing the reaction to punishment and physical pain of both dogs, he arrives by means of both subtle and reckless reasoning at the following conclusion: Bauschan nimlich ist zwar derb, wie das Volk, aber auch wehleidig wie dieses; wiihrend sein adliger Vorginger mit mehr Zartheit und Leidensfihigkeit eine unvergleichlich festere und stolzere Seele ver- band und trotz aller Narrheit es an Selbstzucht dem Biuerlein bei weitem zuvortat. Nicht im Sinne einer aristokratischen Lehrmei- nung, sondern einzig und allein der Lebenswahrheit zu Ehren hebe ich diese Mischung der Gegensitze von grob und weichlich, zart und standhaft hervor. (p. 232) The reader acquainted with Thomas Mann's literary characters is invited to and will unfailingly identify Bauschan and Percy with their human prototypes, the Kloterjahns and Spinells and their numerous variants in Mann's prose fiction. The illusion created by a mirror tech- nique, by this deft superimposition of human on canine psychology is so much more convincing because Thomas Mann never carries this proc- ess of subtle humanization of animal reactions to ludicrous extremes. The temptation to analyze the behavior of his four-footed companion at times leads Thomas Mann into inconsistencies. Thus, for instance, he will, by way of introduction, carefully point out the chasm of com- munication that separates us from the canine. He will then describe with subtle earthiness that frightful circumstantiality attendant on the meeting of dog with dog (p. 235 ff.). Admitting on the one hand his inability to enter into the feelings and behavior of the participants, or</page><page sequence="5">Thomas Mann 211 to understand the tribal laws which govern their strange ritual, he will proceed, most inconsistently, to interpret the canine encounter analy- tically. And when, in doing so, Mann endows these dogs with such emotions as mental anguish and distress, with profound embarrassment and scruples of conscience, he very definitely enters into the realm of anthropocentric assumptions, which in terms of animal psychology rest on a scientific basis equally as insecure as the previously discussed canine typology. Anthropomorphisms of this sort, of course, do not detract from the purely literary value of this idyl, no more than even greater in- cursions into human psychology impair the aesthetic appeal, of let us say, Kipling's animal tales. Viewed in the light of accepted criteria of the realistic animal tale, Thomas Mann's "Herr und Hund" may not be "the finest study of the mind of a dog ever written" (Scheffauer), but it undeniably does contain some of the most literate observations as well as some of the most intriguing speculations about canis familiaris in German animal literature. In brief, the distinction of this narrative does not lie in its scientific accuracy but rather in the unique and fascinating fusion of Wahrheit und Dichtung, of superb perception and bold speculation. "Herr und Hund," after all, is not a scientific documentation of canine psychology, but rather a work of love and relaxation. Thomas Mann wrote this narrative as a sort of therapeutic exercise at a time when his principal energies were devoted to a cultural and political self-investigation which found expression in Die Betrachtungen eines Unpolitischen. Therefore, "Herr und Hund" should not be looked upon as the serious attempt of a distinguished author to gather laurels in a new field, but rather as a delightful suspension of Mann's critical judgment in the literary form of an idyllic animal tale. " No more than Churchill's fame rests on his paintings, or Einstein's on his playing the violin, does Thomas Mann's literary stature rest on this charming canine idyl. 11 Cf. also Howard Coxe, "An Artist with a Bad Conscience," New Republic LXV (December 3, 1930), P. 79, and Frederic Book, "Thomas Mann's Idyller," Essayer och Kritiker 1919-I92o (Stockholm, 92zI), p. 99.</page></plain_text>
