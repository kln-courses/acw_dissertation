<plain_text><page sequence="1">LATE ARCHAIC TOTEMISM IN THE GREATER AMERICAN SOUTHWEST Nancy J. Coulam and Alan R. Schroedl Split-twig figurines, willow branches bent to resemble miniature animals and dating between 2900 B.C. and 1250 B.C., have been found at 30 Late Archaic period archaeological sites in the Greater American Southwest. Two different and geo- graphically distinct construction styles, Grand Canyon and Green River, have been identifiedfor split-twig figurines. Appli- cation of ethnographic analogy to the current split-twig figurine archaeological record supports the postulate that the two different styles of split-twig figurines served two different functions. The Grand Canyon-style figurines generally functioned as increase totems whereas the Green River-style functioned as social totems. This is the first example of increase totemism reported for the region. Ritual and social attitudes toward the animal and totem eventually ended and the last split-twig fig- urine was discarded around 1250 B.C. Figuritas hechas de ramitas hendidas dobladas para parecerse a animals miniatures y datando de entre los aiios 2900 A. C. y 1250 A. C. han sido encontradas en 30 sitios arqueoldgicos del periodo afines de la Epoca Arcaica en el Suroeste Americano. Dos diferentes y geogrdficamente distintos estilos de construccidn, el Gran Caiion y el Rio Verde, han sido identificados como figuritas hechas de ramitas hendidas. La aplicaci6n de analogia etnogrdfica al informe arqueolo'gico de las figuritas hecas de ramitas hendidas apoya el postulado que los dos estilos diferentes de figuritas hechas de ramitas hendidas sirven dos fun- ciones diferentes, el estilo de las figuritas del Gran Cahion por lo generalfunction6 como t6temes de aumento mientras el estilo del Rio Verde funciono' como t6temes sociales. Este es elprimer ejemplo de 'totemismo de aumento' informado para la regi6n. Las actitudes rituales y sociales hacia el animal y el t6tem eventualmente se acabaron y la altima figurita hecha de ramitas hendidas fue desechada alrededor de 1250 A. C. S plit-twig figurines are constructed by split- ting and wrapping a long, thin branch of skunkbush (Rhus aromatica) or seepwillow (Baccharis sp.) to represent miniature animals (Fig- ure 1), generally assumed to be artiodactyls. Their ingenious form, aesthetic appeal, and age have cap- tured the imagination of artists, archaeologists, and visitors to the Greater American Southwest since they were first reported in the 1930s (Jett 1991). In their modem cultural context, split-twig figurines have become emblematic of the Grand Canyon because it is often reported that they were first dis- covered by a Civilian Conservation Corps trail crew working within the Grand Canyon in 1933 (Euler 1966a, 1966b; Wheeler 1939, 1949) and because most of them have been recovered from prehistoric cave sites in the Grand Canyon (Emslie et al. 1995; Farmer and deSaussure 1955; Schroedl 1977; Schwartz et al. 1958). However, the first modem discovery of a split-twig figurine occurred in 1930 at Cottonwood Cave (SR-16-6) in southeastern Utah by archaeologist Henry Roberts (Gunnerson 1969:Fig. 39g). His discovery was not published until 1969, and thus, he has not been credited with the first discovery of a split-twig figurine in the twentieth century. Since Roberts's recovery of the first split-twig figurine in Utah in 1930, more than 400 specimens have been reported from at least 30 archaeological sites in four western states1 (Emslie et al. 1995; Schroedl 1977). Two different and geographically distinct construction styles have been defined for these artifacts (Janetski 1980), and numerous direct and associated radiocarbon dates demonstrate that split-twig figurines were manufactured for almost 1,700 years from about 2900 B.C. to 1250 B.C. dur- ing the Late Archaic period in the Greater Ameri- can Southwest.

Grand Canyon-style split-twig figurines. Since the 1930s, archaeologists have speculated that split-twig figurines functioned as children's toys, hunting fetishes, or some other form of "magico-religious object" (Emslie et al. 1995; Hildebrandt and McGuire 2002:243; Schroedl 1977; Wheeler 1937:181). Schwartz et al. (1958) attempted to resolve the question of figurine func- tion by applying a direct-historic approach, but interpretations by modem tribal informants proved as vague and speculative as those of the archaeol- ogists. With additional data on the context, age, and distribution of split-twig figurines, Schroedl (1977) posited that the figurines from the Grand Canyon region functioned as ritual objects, whereas those from elsewhere served a more secular function such as children's toys; however, Schroedl did not pro- vide a theoretical basis for these functional inter- pretations. Through a hermeneutic approach, we attempt to refine previous functional discussions of split-twig figurines by contextualizing split-twig figurines using a combination of Asher's (1961) "new analogy," Hultkrantz's (1966) "religio-eco- logical method," and Binford's (2001) use of the cross-cultural record of hunting and gathering peo- ples as a frame of reference. According to Asher (1961), where direct histori- cal continuity cannot be demonstrated, archaeologists should restrict their range of analogies to ethno- graphically documented societies that manipulate similar environments in similar ways as the target pre- historic society; i.e., analogs for zoomorphic split- twig figurines should be restricted to hunting-and-gathering societies. Taking Asher's anal- ogy a step further, Hultkrantz (1966) recommends that when seeking religious analogs, archaeologists should include environmental considerations. Bin- ford (2001) shows that when stratified by the envi- ronment, the ethnographic record of hunting-and-gathering societies provides the best available analog for the study of variability in the archaeological record of hunter-gatherers. Therefore, to identify the most probable "magico-religious"</page><page sequence="3">Coulam and Schroedl] LATE ARCHAIC TOTEMISM IN THE SOUTHWEST 43 objects that might inform on the archaeological record of manufacture, use, and deposition of split-twig fig- urines, we searched the standard cross-cultural sam- ple for the magico-religious practices of arid-land hunter-gatherers (Winkelman 2000). While recognizing that the prehistoric record of hunter-gatherers could include greater variability than that documented ethnographically, the reli- gions of all ethnographically documented hunter- gatherers focus on animals and animistic beliefs (Brightman 1993; Guenther 1997, 1999). This focus is translated into three-dimensional repre- sentations of animals in one of two ways: as indi- vidual fetishes or as group totems. By definition, a fetish is an inanimate object that an individual uses to obtain magical or super- natural power. The fetish may be a natural object such as a stone, feather, animal part, or it a may be a constructed object. Among hunter-gatherers and incipient agricultural societies, hunters or shamans manufacture or use fetishes that symbolize animals as a means of gaining supernatural power over the animal represented by the object (Frazer 1961; Goldenweiser 1910:180; Haddon 1910; Herskovits 1972:377; Sapir 1970:133-135). In our cross-cultural search, we rejected the hypothesis that split-twig figurines were fetishes used by individuals for hunting magic or by shamans for healing, divination, or magic for two reasons. First, fetishes (including hunting charms) are personal property and only the owner can derive power from them. Second, there is a strong expec- tation of originality in shamanic performance (Guenther 1999:430) requiring fetishes to be unique to the individual shamanic performer. As personal property of the hunter or the shaman, fetishes are almost always destroyed upon the death of their owner and rarely transmitted from one gen- eration to the next. We will show in the following sections that the manufacture of split-twig figurines was transmitted across too many generations for them to have been the property of an individual hunter or shaman. If split-twig figurines were not fetishes used by individuals or in individualistic cults like shaman- ism, then we must move up the scale of religious complexity to communal cults (Wallace 1966) for our ethnographic analog. Although even the most individualistic hunting-and-gathering societies (e.g., the Eskimo) have some communal rites, com- munal cults are correlated with complex societies of hunter-gatherers in North American, Melanesia, or Australia which are internally segmented into corporate groups. These groups employ symbolic representations of natural species or phenomena to identify group members and to symbolize group unity. These group-identifying animals or objects are known as totems, derived from an Ojibwa word denoting clan membership (Wagner 1987:573; Warren 1957:42). Today, anthropologists use the term "totem" to include the animal, plant, or nat- ural phenomena by which the social group identi- fies its members, as well as the images or objects the group members create or manufacture to sym- bolize their relationship with the natural species or phenomena. As Goldenweiser (1918), Levi-Strauss (1962) and Atkinson (1992) caution, the forms of totemism and shamanism vary widely, but by definition, totems are the corporate property of a social group such as a clan or moiety, whereas fetishes are the property of an individual. Totems are a heritable part of a group's corporate estate and they survive beyond the life span of any one individual, whereas fetishes are personal property that rarely are trans- mitted between generations. In the following sections, we demonstrate the concordance between two forms of totemism, increase totemism and social totemism, and the archaeological record of split-twig figurines. In constructing our interpretation by analogy, first we compile and evaluate the archaeological data on split-twig figurines including the radiocarbon record, construction styles, geographic distribu- tion, and the context of discovery. We conclude that split-twig figurines were ini- tially manufactured ca. 2900 B.C. by a Late Archaic clan (or other descent group) whose ter- ritory included the Grand Canyon. We argue that split-twig figurines originally represented bighorn sheep and a clan adopted this symbol to identify its members in opposition to members of other clans. Due to ethnographically documented processes such as residential fissioning, the con- struction of split-twig figurines spread to other areas where the figurines served only social or classifying functions, not magic or ritual func- tions. Based on the current radiocarbon record, by about 1250 B.C., the manufacture of split-twig fig- urines ended, presumably along with the existence</page><page sequence="4">44 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 69, No. 1, 2004 of the bighorn sheep clan that originally created these unique artifacts. Split-Twig Figurine Sites Split-twig figurines have only been recovered from sites where perishable artifacts have persisted for the past several thousand years. Although there are a great number of excavated caves and rockshel- ters in western North America that have produced, perishable remains, split-twig figurines have only been reported at 30 archaeological sites in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah (Table 1; Figure 2). Because of the large number of excavated sites with dry, well-preserved deposits from the Late Archaic period throughout the western United States, we believe the geographic distribution of the 30 sites with split-twig figurines approximates the original geographic territory where these items were made and used. Most sites with split-twig figurines are located along the Colorado River or its tributaries. Split-twig figurines have not been recovered from any sites located within the hydrological Great Basin. Of the 30 sites yielding split-twig figurines, 27 have been previously reported. The three newly reported sites are all in Utah. Ranger Gary Cox of Canyonlands National Park reported to the authors that in the early 1990s he discovered a split-twig figurine in an undocumented, undisturbed alcove near the Green River in southeastern Utah. The fig- urine was lying on the surface of the site but may have eroded out of the sidewall of a cist in the alcove. Several Elko Corner-notched projectile points were also noted on the site surface and Bar- rier Canyon Style rock art was present on the alcove walls. Mr. Cox left the figurine in place, but when he revisited the site in early 2000, the figurine and points had been looted. Mr. Cox reported another split-twig figurine at a cave site in Ten Mile Canyon, a left-bank tribu- tary of the Green River, in southeastern Utah. This figurine was also left in place and has subsequently been looted. The third previously unreported site, also in Utah, is currently the northernmost site containing split-twig figurines. This site, a shallow overhang located in Straight Canyon, a tributary of the San Rafael River in central Utah, contained two Green River-style figurines (Figure 3), now displayed at the Museum of the San Rafael in Castledale, Utah. The figurines were associated with charcoal, chipped stone debitage, cordage, sticks (including at least one worked stick), hide, and animal hair. Analysis of the 30 caves and rockshelters that have produced whole or fragmentary split-twig fig- urines allows us to classify these sites into two dichotomous types, ritual sites and domestic sites.2 The distinction between these two site types is based on ethnographic analogy, the specific con- text of the figurines within the site, and the pres- ence or absence of associated artifacts, features, domestic debris, or extinct fauna. Ritual Sites Ritual sites do not contain cultural deposits but may contain cultural features including cache pits and cairns. They show evidence of magic, indicated by speared and dung-filled figurines, and by the place- ment of figurines in association with Pleistocene- age artiodactyls within the site. Figurines from ritual sites are found carefully placed within cache pits or on top of or beneath cairns constructed of packrat midden and rocks. Figurines are also found lying on the interior surface of the site, usually in association with the cave walls. Occasionally the figurines and their associated features are in dark portions of the caves where charcoal and smoke blackening from torches is present (Reilly 1969). Although there is an absence of cultural deposits or domestic debris at ritual sites, twigs left over from the figurine manufacturing process are often present. Some of the figurines from ritual sites show clear evidence of magic: they are pierced with miniature spears and contain animal dung within the figurine body cavity. Frazer (1961:5) defined homoeopathic or imitative magic as a belief that like produces like. Split-twig figurines pierced with miniature spears provide a classic example of rit- ual action under Frazer's Law of Similarity (1961:5): sticking a spear in a zoomorphic figurine is like killing the animal. Likewise, imitative magic accounts for placing dung from a living artiodactyl within a split-twig figurine; i.e., living animals con- tain dung so placing dung within a split-twig fig- urine results in the magical production of a living animal. Ritual cave sites often contain the remains of Pleistocene-age mountain goat (Oreamnos har- ringtoni) and bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis)</page><page sequence="5">0 5. 0 Co m CL O m -I 0 m c Cf) m 0 .-I m C. -I -I- ra -I Table 1.

Map showing the distribution of split-twig figurine sites in the Greater American Southwest. (Emslie et al. 1995). The association between split- twig figurines and these animals attest to contagious magic at these sites. Contagious magic is the belief that things once in contact continue ever afterwards to act on each other (Frazer 1961:5, 17-21; Durkheim1915:356). Under principles of conta- gious magic, placing miniature split-twig figurines next to larger Pleistocene animals would result in an increase in the Holocene game animals repre- sented by the figurines and would thus magically ensure the food supply of the figurine makers. These magical associations of split-twig figurines provide one of the key attributes in the classifica- tion of ritual sites. Finally, many of the ritual sites are relatively inaccessible. All of the 13 ritual sites are located</page><page sequence="7">Coulam and Schroedl] LATE ARCHAIC TOTEMISM IN THE SOUTHWEST 47 Figure 3. Two Green River-style split-twig figurines from Straight Canyon, Utah. either within the narrow gorge of the Colorado River or within tributary canyons of the Colorado River. For example, Shrine Cave (Emslie et al. 1987; Emslie et al. 1995) is a ritual cave site located more than 200 m above the Colorado River in Grand Canyon. It requires technical climbing to enter and is deep and dark. It contained two split- twig figurines associated with at least 33 cairns. The split-twig figurines, along with other split twigs, were also associated with the bones, horn sheaths, and dung of mountain goat and bighorn sheep. Stanton's Cave (Euler 1984; Gunnerson 1955; Jett 1968; Reeder 1967; Reilly 1966), located in Marble Canyon of the Colorado River, is another ritual cave site. It contained at least 165 split-twig figurines, all from surficial deposits or cache pits. Test trenches yielded a few associated artifacts of cordage, chipped stone tools, and ground stone, but no evidence of domestic deposits or use. This site also contained remains of mountain goat and bighorn sheep. Tse-An-Kaetan (Farmer and de Saussure 1955; Schwartz et al. 1958) is a ritual cave site located in Cremation Canyon, a tributary of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon. At this site, numerous fig- urines were found on the surface, within cache pits, or on top of small cairns. Associated artifacts include grass bundles, cordage-wrapped human hair, worked wood including a torch, spatula, awl, vine-wrapped stick, spear, chipped stone flake wrapped in bark, hammer stone, and dart point. Despite the presence of these artifacts and some ash and charcoal, Schwartz et al. (1958) found no evi- dence for domestic use of the site. This site also contained evidence of mountain goat and bighorn sheep. Tse-An-Sha and White Cave (Farmer and de Saussure 1955; Schwartz et al. 1958) are two rit- ual cave sites located on tributaries of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon. They contained only fig- urines and the remains of mountain goat (Emslie et al. 1987). No other artifacts or evidence of domestic use was reported from these sites. Other ritual sites and bibliographic references are listed in Table 1. In conclusion, we identify 13 split-twig figurine sites as ritual or magic sites. We argue by analogy that these sites evidence figurine manufacture and deposition under the principles of imitative and contagious magic. According to Frazer (1961:5-9), a practitioner of imitative magic infers he can pro- duce a desired effect by merely imitating it. Frazer gives a number of examples of how the act of rep- resenting a game animal or food plant is believed to give birth to the animal or plant, or to charm the animal to its destruction. Under the principles of imitative magic, production of split-twig zoomor- phic figurines would magically result in the birth of the animal represented by the figurine. Furthermore, depositing miniature zoomorphic figurines near bones of larger Pleistocene artio- dactyls provides evidence for Late Archaic beliefs in contagious magic. The Late Archaic hunters, as expert zoologists, would have recognized the remains of the larger Pleistocene artiodactyls as ancestral to the smaller Holocene artiodactyls. Under the principle of contagious magic, placing split-twig zoomorphic figurines in proximity or contagious association with the larger Pleistocene</page><page sequence="8">48 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 69, No. 1, 2004 fauna would magically result in an increase in the size of the animals represented by the figurines. Domestic Sites Domestic sites with split-twig figurines, in contrast to ritual sites, are defined by the presence of debris produced by everyday activities. At these sites, split-twig figurines are not placed within cairns or caches, nor are they found associated with Pleis- tocene fauna. The figurines are simply incorpo- rated into middens created from daily living. At domestic sites, none of the split-twig figurines con- tains artiodactyl dung and none is pierced by minia- ture spears; in fact, there is no evidence for a magical association or a ritual attitude toward these figurines at domestic sites. Figurines in domestic sites are associated with discarded occupational debris, including other perishable artifacts such as basketry, cordage, dart foreshafts, etc., and with stone tools, grinding implements, debitage, and features such as hearths, pits, etc. Seventeen sites are classified as domestic sites (see Table 1). Because figurines were discarded in middens at domestic sites, they are often recovered as frag- ments from more recent strata where prehistoric pit digging brought them upwards and resulted in their breaking and redeposition. Dating of split-twig fig- urines has been problematical at domestic sites because of this redeposition and artifact mixing of multiple components. However, the advent of direct AMS radiocarbon dating of the figurines them- selves has alleviated many of these dating and asso- ciational issues at domestic sites. The two most completely reported domestic sites containing split-twig figurines are Cowboy Cave in Utah and Newberry Cave in California. Cowboy Cave (Jennings 1980; Schroedl and Coulam 1994), located along a tributary of the Green River in southeastern Utah, contained domestic deposits spanning several thousand years. To date, 24 whole and fragmentary figurines have been recovered from the site. As discussed below, two new AMS radiocarbon dates on figurine frag- ments from the upper strata confirm Berry and Berry's (1986) hypothesis that split-twig figurines were manufactured during the Late Archaic and were moved upward and redeposited due to pre- historic pit digging. The Late Archaic domestic deposits at Cowboy Cave that contained the fig- urines include a wide variety of chipped stone tools such as Gypsum Contracting-stem and Elko Cor- ner-notched points, bifaces, scrapers, and drills. Perishable objects include basketry, S-twist cordage, and dart shafts. Bone awls, groundstone, and rawhide were also present, as were faunal remains from mountain sheep, deer, and rabbit. The other major domestic site is Newberry Cave (Davis and Smith 1981). This cave site is located in the Newberry Mountains, near the Mojave River in southern California. The cave contained at least one whole and 10 fragmentary split-twig figurines in domestic deposits. Associated artifacts include split twigs, wood and cane dart shaft fragments, an atlatl, fire-drill sets, sandals, leather fragments, cordage, sinew, and shell. Stone artifacts included Gypsum Contracting-stem, Elko Corner-notched, and Elko Eared projectile points, a mano-ham- merstone, a ground stone palette, chipped stone bifaces, and debitage. The cave also contained sinew-wrapped sheep dung, sinew-wrapped feath- ers, three crystals, and green, red, black, and white pigment stones. Several artifacts were colored with pigment. Pictographs including a handprint and quadrupeds, possibly bighorn sheep, were present inside the cave. Newberry Cave is the westernmost site containing split-twig figurines. Domestic sites, by definition, are habitation sites of Late Archaic hunting and collecting peoples. As discussed below, the figurines recovered from the middens of these sites had social and semiotic func- tions, but no obvious economic or utilitarian func- tions, nor do they have a magical association like the speared figurines carefully cached in the ritual cave sites. Figurine Construction Styles Based on differences in figurine construction, Janet- ski (1980) distinguished the Green River [Utah] and the Grand Canyon style, each named after the region where the style predominates. The plant used for construction, skunkbush or seepwillow, does not determine form or style; instead, the most apparent constructional difference between the two styles is in the outermost body wrapping. Bodies of the Grand Canyon figurines consist of horizon- tal wrappings held together by a few vertical wraps at the neck, while bodies of the Green River style are formed by underlying horizontal body wraps completely overlain with vertical body wraps. While this difference is obvious, it was not until</page><page sequence="9">Coulam and Schroedl] LATE ARCHAIC TOTEMISM IN THE SOUTHWEST 49 Janetski (1980) disassembled two Cowboy Cave figurines that additional diagnostic construction attributes were defined. Grand Canyon figurines show remarkable uni- formity in construction that Schwartz et al. (1958:269, 270) described as follows. The unsplit portion of the twig is bent at a right angle to form the back leg and spine of the animal. At the neck, the twig is split and half of it is bent down to form the back half of the front leg, then up to form the front half of the front leg, then up to form the neck and head. The upper split twig that had been left at the neck is then wrapped horizontally back around the front and rear legs to form the body. Then the remainder of the twig at the head is either coiled around the neck or brought vertically down to fin- ish the neck. It is then bent under the body in back of the front leg and wrapped vertically one or more times around the horizontal body wraps (Euler 1966a:64; Schwartz et al. 1958; Wheeler 1973). These vertical body wraps or coils may be the last step in making a Grand Canyon figurine, or if the twig is long enough, it is brought vertically up to form a third vertical neck piece, then wrapped around the crown of the head, then down around the neck and tucked in to complete the specimen. Janetski (1980:92) graphically illustrates the differences in Grand Canyon and Green River fig- urines. As he described, the initial difference between the two styles is that the unsplit, proximal end of the twig forms the body core in the Grand Canyon style, but only the back legs in the Green River style. A split twig at the posterior results in a Green River style, a split at the neck or chest results in a Grand Canyon-style figurine. Based on analysis of photographs and descrip- tions of existing specimens, most figurines can be classified by style. The Green River style figurines have only been found in domestic sites located in central and southeastern Utah. All the remaining figurines at all the other sites in California, Nevada, and Arizona are Grand Canyon style. These two dif- ferent construction styles are geographically iso- lated. The Grand Canyon style is found at both ritual and domestic sites in California, Nevada, and Arizona, whereas the Green River style is found only at domestic sites in Utah. The geographical distribution of these styles has important behav- ioral, temporal, and functional implications, dis- cussed below. Age of Split-Twig Figurines The age of split-twig figurines has been of consid- erable archaeological interest since they were first reported. In 1939, Wheeler noted that at Etna Cave one specimen was associated with Basketmaker III pottery and the second with Gypsum points "for which a ground-sloth period age was suggested" (Wheeler 1939:44). However, it was not until the advent of radiocarbon dating that the chronologi- cal placement of these artifacts could be determined with any certainty. The first direct radiocarbon dates were obtained by Schwartz et al. (1958) on two fig- urines from Tse-An-Kaetan. Each was older than 3,000 radiocarbon years, several thousand years earlier than Schwatz et al. (1958:272) had antici- pated. Since the 1950s, numerous other direct and asso- ciated radiocarbon dates have been reported for split-twig figurines. Figurines or figurine fragments have been directly radiocarbon dated from seven sites in each of the four states: Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah. As of January 2001, 17 radio- carbon dates3 have been directly obtained from split-twig figurines. The dates range from about 3100 to 4100 radiocarbon years B.P. (Table 2). Although the split-twig figurine radiocarbon dates only span approximately 1,000 radiocarbon years, calibration of these dates to the Gregorian calen- dar demonstrates that split-twig figurines were actu- ally manufactured from about 2900 B.C. to 1250 B.C., almost 1,700 calendar years or about 80 gen- erations, based on the earliest directly dated split- twig figurine (UCLA-741) from Stantons Cave in the Grand Canyon and the latest composite sam- ple (LJ-993) from Newberry Cave in California.4 A series of 20 other associated radiocarbon dates from both ritual and domestic sites supports the cal- ibrated date range of split-twig figurines (Table 3). From five ritual cave sites in the Grand Canyon (Shrine Cave, Left Eye Cave, Rebound Cave, Five Windows Cave, and Right Eye Cave), 12 radio- carbon dates have been obtained from bent and split twigs, as well as from charcoal and a grass bundle. From two domestic sites, Newberry Cave and Cowboy Cave, eight associated radiocarbon dates have been obtained from cultural refuse deposits containing split-twig figurines.

Euler and Olson 1965 twig figurines (Emslie et al. 1995). Because no fig- urines were found within Crescendo Cave and the calibrated one-sigma date range of 3335-2890 B.C. is several hundred years earlier than any of the direct or associated dates, we interpret this date as outside the limit of the earliest use and manufac- ture of split-twig figurines in the Greater American Southwest. Also not included in Table 3 are dates from the Early Archaic and post-Late Archaic occupations at Cowboy Cave (Schroedl and Coulam 1994) and two AMS radiocarbon dates from Island Mesa: Coyote Creek in southeastern Utah (Jett 1991). Based on a reanalysis of the data, Schroedl and Coulam (1994) dismissed the correlation of split- twig figurines and corn at Cowboy Cave reported by Jennings (1980). The radiocarbon dates on two directly dated figurines from the corn-bearing strata reported in this paper (see note 3) demonstrate con- clusively that there is no temporal association between corn horticulture and split-twig figurines at Cowboy Cave. The split-twig figurines from Island Mesa (Jett 1991) were reportedly recovered from a burial cache from which two AMS radiocarbon dates were obtained. The cache purportedly included a child burial, some fiber artifacts, three figurines, and two caches of corn wrapped in yucca leaves. None of the figurines were directly dated but corn and a yucca fragment were radiocarbon dated to the first millennium B.C. The association of the split-twig figurines with the dated items is questionable. First, the site was not professionally excavated and the 15-year-old recollections of the looter were the only basis for the association. Second, none of the hundreds of other split-twig figurines at either domestic or ritual sites have been associated with human burials. Third, as noted above, there is no known temporal association between corn and split-twig figurines. With 17 direct radiocarbon dates supplemented by 20 associated radiocarbon dates, split-twig fig- urines are now one of the best-dated artifact types of the Archaic period (see Geib 2000, for Archaic sandal dating). Based on these dates, the construc- tion and use of split-twig figurines can be confi- dently dated between 2900 B.C. and 1250 B.C. The radiocarbon dates show that split-twig fig- urine construction originated in the Grand Canyon region as a ritual or magical activity about 2900 B.C. Within 300 years, by ca. 2600 B.C., the Grand Canyon style of figurine construction had begun to diffuse south and west to central Arizona, Nevada, and eastern California (most likely through a process of residential mobility or fissioning), and continued in these outlying areas until approxi- mately 1250 B.C. Meanwhile, ritual use of split- twig figurines continued within the Grand Canyon until ca. 1700 B.C.5 By 2150 B.C., split-twig figurine construction</page><page sequence="11">0 0 C,) r- m I 17 0 -I m I m 0 --I 0 m C,) -4 m' Table 3.

Reproduction of a Grand Canyon style figurine manufactured in 2001 in the Grand Canyon on a river trip. also diffused from the Grand Canyon to south- eastern Utah where the Green River style devel- oped. The Green River style appears to have been relatively short-lived, from ca. 2150 B.C. to 1500 B.C., approximately 650 years or 30 generations. Unlike the figurines within Grand Canyon, Green River-style figurines are not associated with magic or ritual. Rather, figurines of this style are exclu- sively found discarded in domestic middens. Almost 3,000 years have passed between the time that Late Archaic hunter-gatherers discarded the last split-twig figurine at Newberry Cave and Henry Roberts excavated one at Cottonwood Cave in 1930. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in split-twig figurines. Today, split-twig figurines are replicated as jewelry, keychains, and souvenirs (Figure 4). They are depicted in books, postcards, and on T-shirts. These objects and images have been adopted by visitors to and resi- dents of the modem Southwest as symbols of the region and the distant past. In the remainder of this paper, we apply ethnographic analogy to attempt to describe what these objects symbolized to their Late Archaic creators 3,000 years ago. Ethnographic Analogy and the Totemic Model In this section, we provide a general definition of totemism, followed by descriptions of some of the forms of totemism found among arid-land hunter- gatherers. We argue that increase rituals docu- mented among Australian Aborigines provide the best fit for the archaeologically documented pat- terns of split-twig figurine construction, use, and discard in the Greater American Southwest. As an exercise in hermeneutics and interpretive archae- ology (Hodder 1991), the reader may verify the validity of our interpretation by assessing how much of the archaeological data are accounted for by the totemic model in comparison to others. Totemism Totemism is a classificatory system whereby a human social group expresses isomorphic proper- ties between nature and culture (Ldvi-Strauss 1963). Totemism may be found wherever larger societies are segmented into a number of equiva- lent social groups, whether kinship groups, corpo- rations, military units, or sports teams. Although the forms of totemism are variable, the defining fea- ture of totemic systems is the characterization of social groups by an association and identification with a natural species or phenomena. This associ- ation may revolve around social structure or it may involve magic or ritual, but in all cases, totemism enables one social group to symbolically differen- tiate itself from others by uniting its members (totemites) in shared activities, behaviors, attitudes, or relationships towards their totem (Durkheim 1915; Radcliffe-Brown 1965:117; Wagner 1987). Goldenweiser (1910) and L6vi-Strauss (1962, 1963) have argued that there is too much variabil- ity in the associations or relationships people adopt toward natural species for totemism to be a heuris- tic concept. However, at the end of his career Gold- enweiser (1946:322-327) concluded that totemism was almost universally correlated with exogamous sibs or clans, even with its varied forms. Today, ear- lier critiques of totemism have been dismissed by ethnographers, especially those working with Aus- tralian hunter-gatherers (Shapiro 1991). Totemism and shamanism (including animism and guardian spirit beliefs) are now recognized by anthropolo- gists of religion as the only complexes of magical belief and ritual associated with hunter-gatherers (Guenther 1999:476; Winkelman 2000). Ethnographers have argued for years (McConnel 1930; Worsley 1967) whether hunter- gatherers select their totem because of its eco-</page><page sequence="13">Coulam and Schroedl] LATE ARCHAIC TOTEMISM IN THE SOUTHWEST 53 nomic value or whether it is simply an arbitrary symbol. Most totems are economically important game animals or food plants. For example, 20 of the 21 dodaim or totems of the Ojibway were ani- mals (Warren 1957:43-45) and 4 of the 12 totems of the Chickasaw were animals (Speck 1907:51). Totemic animals of southern California moieties included coyote, wild cat, blue jay, bullfrog, bear, and deer (Kroeber 1925:837). Regardless of the species represented, the selected totem became the hereditary symbol, emblem, or eponym of the totemites. Two forms of totemism are relevant to the dis- cussion of split-twig figurines: social totemism and increase totemism. Under social totemism, equiv- alent social groups adopt a totem as a symbolic rep- resentation for the group and to define and differentiate the totemites in opposition to other groups (Berndt and Berndt 1988; Elkin 1976; Peter- son 1972:29; Radcliffe-Brown 1965:117). Social totemism correlates with exogamous unilineal moi- eties and clans and its main function appears to be the regulation of marriage or the naming of indi- vidual totemites (Gifford 1916). No magical rites are associated with social totems; the totem merely symbolizes group iden- tity. As a symbol of the social group and way of classifying marriageable partners, representations of social totems are painted, tattooed, carved, woven, or embroidered by the totemites to show group membership (Durkheim 1915:115-119; Goldenweiser 1918:293; Warren 1957:42). Cross- culturally, social totemism is the most common form of totemism. Typical North America exam- ples of social totemism are found among the moi- eties of the Miwok, Yokuts, Cupefio, and Cahuilla (Gayton 1930; Gifford 1916; Kroeber 1925). As explicated below, we believe that the manufacture and distribution of the Green River-style split-twig figurines is a result of social totemism. A special form of totemism, increase totemism, also distinguishes hunter-gatherer social groups, but this form of totemism has additional magic and ritual aspects (Berndt and Berndt 1988; Elkin 1976). In addition to its sociological function of reg- ulating marriage and patrilineal inheritance, increase totemism is defined by magical actions designed to increase or maintain the animal species that serves as the group's totem. Ethnographically, increase totemism coexists within societies also practicing social totemism (Elkin 1976:118-119, 183; Peterson 1972). Forms of increase totemism are widespread and diverse among Australian hunter-gatherers, but have not been previously recorded from North America (Goldenweiser 1946:325). The defining character- istic (Radcliffe-Brown 1930a, 1930b; 1965:121) is a four-fold association between: (1) a natural species or phenomenon that serves as the group's totem; (2) a patrilineal clan or moiety with inherited rights to land or valued resources; (3) sacred sites within the clan territory where the totem is plentiful and believed to have originated and where ceremonies are performed that are believed to maintain the fecundity of the species; and (4) a mythology wherein ancestors established the supernatural rela- tionships uniting the totem, the sacred sites, and the clan or moiety. The best-known examples of increase totemism are the intichiuma rituals of the Arunta, Kaitish, and Unmatjera tribes, and the maraiin of Arnhem Land (see Belier 1997; Berndt and Berndt 1988; Elkin 1976; McConnel 1930; Myers 1991; Peterson 1972; Piddington 1932). Under all the forms of increase totemism, male totemites periodically travel to sacred sites, called cult lodges, totem centers, or increase centers, located within clan territory, to perform rituals to regulate or maintain the natural species that serves as the clan's totem. For some totemites, visits to the increase centers are annual events (Peterson 1972:22; Piddington 1932:377); for others, visits are periodic events associated with initiation of young boys into the status of men (Elkin 1976:267; Kaberry 1938:274-277); for still others, visits only occur every 15-20 years when environmental con- ditions are favorable enough to enable totemites to congregate (Strehlow 1970). The frequency of vis- its to increase centers varies, but the location of increase centers is fixed by availability of perma- nent water, a prevalence of the totemic species in the area, and by a mythological belief that the totem originated or issued forth from the increase center. Within the centers, increase rites range from simply calling out the name of the totem and singing songs about it to dramatizations of myths associated with the site and the totem (Belier 1997). But whatever the elaboration of the rituals per- formed in the increase centers, acts of imitative or contagious magic are the most common. For exam- ple, maraiin objects of Arnhem Land, wooden fig-</page><page sequence="14">54 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 69, No. 1, 2004 urines representing the animals, birds, or fish that are the clans' totems, are used in increase rituals (Berndt and Berndt 1988). Leading men of the clan arrange the maraiin figurines in a circle and dance around them in the presence of initiated men. Blood is dripped on the figurines or red ochre rubbed on them to imitate blood because the principles of imi- tative magic are believed to promote life and health of the species represented by the maraiin totem. These manufactured totems are either stored at the increase centers for future use or sometimes they are made for the occasion and afterward destroyed (Berndt and Berndt 1988:431). Emically, increase rites have the synchronic function of magically maintaining or propagating natural species and the cosmological order of nature (Meggitt 1962:206-232). Etically, increase totemism has the diachronic function of transmit- ting clan property, including land, totems, rituals, and mythology, from one generation to the next (Keen 1994; Morphy 1990, 1991; Munn 1973:37; Myers 1991; Radcliffe-Brown 1965:34). We believe that increase totemism provides the most parsimonious explanation for the manufac- ture, deposition, and distribution of Grand Canyon style split-twig figurines. It is the coexistence of both increase totemism and social totemism that accounts for the differences in deposition of split- twig figurines in domestic and ritual archaeologi- cal sites in the Greater American Southwest, as argued below. Split-twig Figurines As Animal Totems Based upon the definitions provided above, we argue that some of the Grand Canyon style split- twig figurines may be classified as magical objects and specifically as animal totems. The magical associations of these figurines, coupled with their abstraction and consistent manufacturing process, suggests they were totemic objects representing an artiodactyl. The presence of horns on some of the Grand Canyon-style figurines (Euler 1984:Figure 2-B- I-F; Figure 5) and the presence of tails and ears on some of the Green River-style figurines indicates there may have been spatial and temporal variation in what animal or animals the figurines represented. This variation may indicate the presence of multi- ple totemic clans or multiple associated animals, as among Miwok moieties (Kroeber 1925:453). Despite variations, the repetitive and consistent manufacturing of both the Grand Canyon and the Green River styles, the total number of split-twig figurines, the magical associations of the Grand Canyon ritual sites, and finally the widespread geo- graphical distribution of figurine sites across the GreaterAmerican Southwest can only be accounted for by instruction by intergenerational groups of fig- urine makers, not by a single individual inventing the manufacturing process and teaching another individual of the succeeding generation. It is this corporate knowledge and transmission over time and space that rules out the classification of split- twig figurines as fetishes or as individual totems. In rejecting the classification of the figurines as fetishes, we are following Frazer's (1961) distinc- tion that fetishes are property of an individual magi- cian or shaman used to gain supernatural power. In contrast, totems are the property of an entire clan or social group. By definition, fetishes are not hereditary, whereas totems are heritable, part of a clan's corporate estate (Keen 1994; Myers 1991:158; Radcliffe-Brown 1965). If there were only a few, unique split-twig figurines, we would probably classify them as fetishes and attribute their manufacture to an individual magician or shaman. Hunter-gatherer shamans generally use crystals, but do occasionally use animal or plant fetishes in their practice of black or white magic (Elkin 1994). An example of a prehistoric fetish from the region where split-twig figurines are found is provided by the "anthropomorphic figurines" from Hogup Cave in northern Utah (Aikens 1970:121, 124; Tuohy 1986). These figurines have only been reported from this one site. They are obviously non-utili- tarian and manufactured at only one time and place, thus they qualify as fetishes or possibly as indi- vidual totems. Split-twig figurines, on the other hand, show great consistency in manufacture over space and time. The Grand Canyon style lasted for at least 1,200 years or 60 generations, while the Green River style lasted for about 30 generations. This consistency can only be achieved by transgenera- tional group instruction, training, and use. Among hunter-gatherers, such corporate knowledge and continuity over time cannot be accounted for by individual fetishism, but is the very essence of totemism. Under all forms of totemism, continuity of the totem, as well as continuity of the clan itself, is ensured by passing on rights to the clan's estate</page><page sequence="15">Coulam and Schroedl] LATE ARCHAIC TOTEMISM IN THE SOUTHWEST 55 Figure 5. Grand Canyon-style split-twig figurines with possible horns. through descent principles, especially through the principle of unilineal inheritance. Thus, the con- sistency in split-twig figurine manufacture and the continuity in depositional patterns of split-twig fig- urines within the Grand Canyon ritual sites can best be explained by totemism in general, and increase totemism in particular. Ritual Cave Sites as Increase Centers While we can never know the mythology of a pre- historic group, we certainly find all the elements needed to support a hunter-gatherer's mythologi- cal belief that the Grand Canyon functioned as an increase center for artiodactyls, most likely bighorn sheep. In Australia, increase centers are located where the totemic species are abundant or plenti- ful, where permanent water is available, and where there is some mythological reason for believing the totemic species originated there (McConnel 1930:187; Radcliffe-Brown 1930a:60, 61, 1930b:210). If we can project the high modem den- sities of bighorn sheep in the Grand Canyon into the prehistoric past, then it would be logical for Late Archaic hunters to believe the animals originated there. Based on ethnographic analogy, the Grand Canyon cave sites were construed by these prehis- toric hunter-gatherers as increase centers, not just because of a high density of modem bighorn sheep, but also because of the remains of larger Pleis- tocene artiodactyls (Oreamnos harringtoni and Ovis canadensis) in the dry cave sites situated above the Colorado River. This combination of elements would have provided the "mytho-logic" that the Grand Canyon was where bighorn sheep originated or issued forth in the mythic past. The goodness- of-fit between the ethnographically described pat- terns of totemism and the patterns of archaeological data for split-twig figurines leads us to conclude that Grand Canyon-style split-twig figurines were animal totems and the Grand Canyon ritual cave sites were increase centers. Totemic Clans during the Late Archaic If we are correct that Grand Canyon ritual cave sites were increase centers and split-twig figurines func- tioned as bighorn sheep totems during magical increase rites, then the totems would have been manufactured in the increase centers by initiated</page><page sequence="16">56 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 69, No. 1, 2004 members of a localized corporate group, most likely a unilineal clan. Totemic clans represent a higher level of sociocultural integration than the hunter- gatherers who occupied the region historically (Steward 1955:151-156). Because archaeologists have tended to apply direct historic models of social organization to the Archaic (Thomas et al. 1986), evidence for a society segmented into totemic clans represents a new and more complex model of Late Archaic social organization than has been previ- ously applied in this region. Conditions necessary for formation of such cor- porate kin groups include a localized increase in population density, a need (or desire) to transmit valued property to succeeding generations, delayed consumption or yields on labor, and, of course, the adoption of shared emblems, eponyms, or rituals to maintain group solidarity (Barnard and Wood- burn 1997; Ellen 1991; Radcliffe-Brown 1965; Steward 1955). We acknowledge semiotic theorists (e.g., Linnekin and Poyer 1990) who find emblems of differentiation, including totems, to be at least as important as competition over scarce resources in the creation and reproduction of socio-ethnic groups. However, if our analogy and application of theory are correct, then by at least 2900 B.C., pop- ulation must have increased across the Greater American Southwest, resources must have become scarce and their exchange restricted, and territories must have become sufficiently crowded for the for- mation of exogamous unilineal clans. One of these clans practiced increase totemism in the Grand Canyon ritual cave sites from 2900 B.C. until at least 1700 B.C. This ritual use of split-twig figurines in the Grand Canyon is apparently the first reported case of increase totemism in North America. By about 2600 B.C., the Grand Canyon-style figurines were being constructed and used at domestic sites in California, Nevada, and Arizona, and by 2150 B.C. the Green River style was being utilized in southeastern Utah at domestic sites. The use, construction, and discard of both styles of fig- urines at these domestic sites is an example of social totemism. At these sites, the totems do not have any magical associations. Because they were discarded in middens, the split-twig figurines probably were symbols or eponyms used to identify and distin- guish local groups through totemic oppositions or perhaps they were used in naming ceremonies for individuals (Strong 1929). The use for Grand Canyon-style split-twig figurines at domestic sites appears to continue until ca. 1250 B.C., long after the cessation of magical and ritual use of these fig- urines in the Grand Canyon ca. 1700 B.C. The Green River style, which only occurs as a social totem, had a much shorter time span from 2150 B.C. to 1500 B.C. Given the temporal difference between the first Grand Canyon-style and the first Green River-style figurines (Figure 6), the archaeological record doc- uments that increase ceremonies were practiced prior to the diffusion of social totemism on the Col- orado Plateau. Using ethnographic analogies, we can speculate about how increase totems might have been transformed into social totems; however, we do not believe it possible to test the archaeo- logical record for these processes. For example, we speculate that typical processes of family fissioning could account for the diffusion. It is common among patrilineal hunter-gatherers for one or more initiated males to leave their clan home, taking their sons, their mythology, and their totems with them (Durkheim and Mauss 1963). Timing of such fissioning is determined by a variety of sociopo- litical or ecological factors including political dis- putes, leadership rivalries, overpopulation, resource stress, pressures of colonization, or relationships with neighboring agriculturists (David and Louran- dos 1998:196; Pedersen and Woehle 1991; Silber- bauer 1972). When the migrant family moves to their new home, they may retain their ideology and continue to replicate variations on their clan designs and symbols, but they officially lose all rights to their former clan estate, including rights to ritual knowl- edge and performance (Morphy 1991; Munn 1973:21; Radcliffe-Brown 1965:34-48). This typi- cal process of family fissioning could account for the few cases of diffused Grand Canyon-style fig- urines in Arizona, Nevada, and California, as well as the diffusion of the Green River style. While dates for the last split-twig figurine dif- fer depending upon style and locality, manufacture of the figurines ceased by 1250 B.C. Just as conti- nuity is accounted for in the ethnographic models of totemism, clan demise or extinction is well doc- umented ethnographically. Processes that might account for the termination of figurine manufac- ture range from death of the last clan member</page><page sequence="17">Coulam and Schroedl] LATE ARCHAIC TOTEMISM IN THE SOUTHWEST 57 Calendar Period Radiocarbon California, Grand Canyon Southern Utah Date Years B.P.

(McConnel 1930:188; Morphy 1991a:69; Pid- dington 1932:376); fusion of clans (Keen 1994); demise of the entire totemic clan (McConnel 1930:188; Morphy 1990, 1991:68, 1997:252); abandonment of ritual attitudes due to culture change (Elkin 1976:189-191); or loss of rights over clan territory due to warfare (Haddon 1910) or land appropriation (Ingold 1982). Any of these processes, alone or in combination, might account for the cessation of manufacture of split-twig fig- urines by 1250 B.C. Summary and Conclusions A review of the current data on split-twig figurines shows that more than 400 figurines manufactured in two distinct construction styles have been iden- tified from at least 30 sites across the GreaterAmer- ican Southwest. Schroedl (1977) posited that the function of split-twig figurines varied according to the types and geographic location of sites and the context of recovery of the figurines. In this paper, building on Schroedl's observa-</page><page sequence="18">58 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 69, No. 1, 2004 tions, formalizing the distinction between domes- tic and ritual sites, and applying an ethnographic model of totemism, we suggest that split-twig fig- urines are animal totems and that their function varied between ritual sites and domestic sites. Rit- ual sites are located only within the Grand Canyon and only include Grand Canyon-style figurines. A few domestic sites with Grand Canyon-style fig- urines are scattered throughout California, Nevada, and Arizona. Another group of domestic sites is clustered in southeastern Utah, but only Green River-style figurines are found at these domestic sites. A series of direct and associated radiocarbon dates indicates that split-twig figurines were man- ufactured from approximately 2900 B.C. to 1250 B.C. during the Late Archaic. Ethnographically documented hunter-gatherer belief systems are limited to totemism and shaman- ism (Guenther 1999:476). We argue that shamanic beliefs and practices (including the fetishism asso- ciated with hunting magic, the guardian spirit com- plex, etc.) that require strong individual performances cannot account for the consistent and repetitive manufacturing of split-twig figurines over many generations. Totemism is the only ethno- graphic process documented among hunter-gath- erers that can account for the continuity of ritual action observed in the archaeological record of split-twig figurines. For the Grand Canyon ritual sites, we argue on the basis of ethnographic analogy that these sites represent evidence of increase totemism. The pres- ence of Pleistocene-aged artiodactyls in dark caves near a major river, coupled with a prevalence of Holocene bighorn sheep, would have provided suf- ficient mytho-logic for hunter-gatherers to believe the Grand Canyon was the place of origin of bighorn sheep. Deposition of speared and dung- filled split-twig figurines in caves with Pleistocene artiodactyls provides ample evidence for beliefs in magic and increase totemism between 2900 B.C. and 1700 B.C. All the ethnographic elements of increase totemism appear to be present in the Grand Canyon ritual cave sites and are sufficiently com- pelling in and of themselves that for more than 1,200 years the ritual cave sites functioned as increase centers and the split-twig figurines func- tioned as bighorn sheep totems of a patrilineal clan. We also suggest, by analogy, that within several hundred years after the initiation of increase totemism in the Grand Canyon, the manufacture of Grand Canyon style split-twig figurines diffused to other locations in California, Nevada, and Arizona, most likely through a process of residential mobil- ity and fissioning. However, the migrant individu- als or groups lost their inherited rights to the increase centers, as well as the ritual attitude toward the totem. For the migrants, split-twig figurines apparently functioned as social totems, that is, as a means of uniting the figurine makers and distin- guishing them from other social groups. We speculate that residential fissioning was also responsible for the development of the Green River- style figurines in southeastern Utah between 2150 B.C. and 1500 B.C. The clans (or descent groups) that discarded Green River-style figurines at these sites were also practitioners of social totemism. The exact social functions of split-twig figurines at these sites is unknown, but based on ethnographic analogy, the duration and discard pattern of the fig- urines indicates they were the corporate property of a social group. By 1250 B.C., ritual attitudes toward the totem (both living animal and symbolic representation) faded away. We may never be able to determine whether it was culture change, demise of initiated clan members, clan extinction, or other processes cited in the ethnographic literature of hunter-gath- erers that led to the cessation of split-twig figurine manufacture, but it is indisputable that with at least today's archaeological record, split-twig figurines ceased being manufactured by Late Archaic hunter- gatherers about 1250 B.C. and it wasn't until the first part of the twentieth century that these unique objects were discovered by archaeologists and once again integrated into Southwestern culture as a symbol of the place and the past.

Not all split-twig figurines could be assigned to a spe- cific site or region. Jett (1987) reports on a split-twig figurine at a trading post in Camaron, Arizona. He was unable to determine where it was recovered. In the 1990s, a split-twig figurine was found after a flash flood in Barrier Creek in Horseshoe Canyon, Utah. The Green River style figurine is curated in Moab. A radiocarbon date on the figurine would demonstrate its age and authenticity but, unfortunately, not its provenance (although it was located downstream from Cowboy and Walters caves). 2. We distinguished ritual sites from domestic sites among the caves and rockshelters discussed in this article. We are aware that split-twig figurines may have been manufac- tured or ritually used on open sites; however, given the poor preservation on open sites, this probably can never be known. 3. Two of the 17 direct dates in Table 2 are newly reported here. In 2000, two figurine fragments from Cowboy Cave were AMS radiocarbon dated to test the hypothesis that split- twig figurines in the upper deposits (Terminal Archaic) were transported upward by more recent aboriginal pit digging. The two dates 3410 + 50 B.P. (Beta-136266; wood; 6'3C = -24.6%o) and 3460 ? 50 B.P. (Beta-136267; wood; 813C = -27. 2%o) confirm that these two figurines were manufactured during the Late Archaic and were redeposited in the later strata by pit excavation during the Terminal Archaic. Beta-</page><page sequence="22">62 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 69, No. 1, 2004] 136266 is a sample from Field Specimen No. 907 from stra- trum Vb (Janetski 1980:91, Fig. 39f). Beta-136267 is a sam- ple from Field Specimen No. 1502 from Stratum Va (Janetski 1980:91, Fig. 39e). 4. The most recent radiocarbon date (LJ-993) was obtained from a composite sample of figurine fragments col- lected in the early 1950s from Newberry Cave. This sample has a calibrated one-sigma date range of 1500-840 B.C., but is somewhat later than two other directly dated figurines frag- ments from the same site, suggesting that perhaps the com- posite sample included some later non-cultural plant materials. The possibility of a contaminated date is corrobo- rated by the fact that this composite sample is also the youngest date of four other samples radiocarbon dated from the Late Archaic component at the site (see Table 3). Together, these data, along with the large standard deviation, suggest that the actual date of manufacture of the figurine ele- ments dated for sample LJ-993 at Newberry Cave falls at the earlier end of the time span and is probably older than 1250 B.C., rather than younger. 5. Schwartz et al. (1958) report a radiocarbon date of 3100 -? 110 radiocarbon years B.P. (AA-47) from a split-twig figurine from Tse-An-Kaetan, a ritual site in the Grand Canyon. Because this was a solid carbon date, we do not believe it accurately represents the last ritual use of split-twig figurines in the region, even though the radiocarbon date itself falls within the range of split-twig figurine use and manufac- ture.
