<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice and Biblical Priestly Literature: A Linguistic Reconsideration* Noam Mizrahi Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Georg-August-Universität Göttingen The Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, a liturgical composition whose fragments were discovered among the Dead Sea scrolls, comprises thirteen songs that describe the heavenly temple and the angels who serve in it as priests and whose main ritual duty is to praise and glorify God.1 These topics are taken commonly to indicate that the Songs was composed in priestly circles, stems from classical priestly traditions, and reflects a priestly agenda and worldview. Thus, for instance, a priestly provenance of the Songs was entertained by Johann Maier.2 Israel Knohl * I am grateful to Professors Avi Hurvitz and Simeon Chavel and to the anonymous HTR reviewer for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper. It was prepared in part while I was Jean Matlow Scholar at the Orion Center for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Associated Literature of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and I thank the Orion Center and its staff for their support and encouragement. 1 The many fragments were sorted to ten copies of the work, published in an admirable preliminary edition by Carol Newsom, Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice: A Critical Edition (HS S 27; Atlanta, Ga.: Scholars, 1985). Quotations from the Songs are taken from the following official publications of the various manuscripts (4Q400-407, Mas, 11Q17): Carol Newsom, "Shirot 'Olat HaShabbat," in Qumran Cave 4, VI: Poetical and Liturgical Texts, Part 1 (DJD 11; Oxford: Clarendon, 1998) 173-401, plates xvi-xxxi; eadem and Yigael Yadin, "The Masada Fragment of the Qumran Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice," in Masada: The Yigael Yadin Excavations 1963-1965, VI: Hebrew Fragments from Masada (ed.

In her view, these texts exhibit numerous thematic, ideological, and terminological affinities that prove that they are parts of a single, well-defined stream of tradition, nurtured by priestly circles.4 To be sure, in this respect the Songs is in no way exceptional, since a priestly provenance has been suggested for other texts of the Second Temple period, such as the book of Jubilees and especially the sectarian texts from Qumran. Nevertheless, such an identification has significant implications for the cultural and religious history of Jewish society during the Greco-Roman period and its potential links with preexilic Israel; as such, it must be analyzed carefully.5 Moreover, each individual text needs to be scrutinized in its own right before an overall synthesis and a general conclusion may be offered. The purpose of this paper is to review the pertinent linguistic and stylistic evidence in the Songs by focusing on three specific case studies. I shall examine the usage and history of three expressions relating to various aspects of the temple and the cult and compare the evidence of the Songs to that of the priestly texts now embedded in the Hebrew Bible.6 the Sabbath Sacrifice and Related Manuscripts (JSPSupp 61; Companion to the Qumran Scrolls 7; London: Continuum, 2006) 129. 3 Israel Knohl, "Between Voice and Silence: The Relationship between Prayer and Temple Cult," JBL 115 (1996) 17-30. 4 Rachel Elior, The Three Temples: On the Emergence of Jewish Mysticism (trans.

Boustan, "Rabbi Ishmael's Priestly Genealogy in Hekhalot Literature," in DeConick, Paradise Now, 127-41.

For the present purposes, it is sufficient to take P en bloc without subdividing it into various strata.</page><page sequence="3">NOAM MIZRAHI 35 ■ Tni "inner sanctum" The Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice The first case study concerns an architectural term relating to the structure of the temple, the word TD"I, which denotes the shrine, or more specifically the inner sanctum, the holiest part of the temple. This lexeme is one of the characteristic items in the lexicon of the Songs. It is attested about thirty times in the work (including partial restorations), while in the rest of the Dead Sea scrolls it is documented in a single attestation, which may in fact be read differently.7 The many occurrences of TD"i in the Songs include four construct phrases that are repeated in various parts of the composition: TOD TD"Î "glorious shrine,"8 ~рй Т!Л "royal shrine,"9 ÌÒS ■'ТИП "wondrous shrines,"10 and ÎOTlp TD1 "holy shrine."11 In these cases, the nomen rectum is a word that refers to God either explicitly or metonymically. In addition, one finds in the work at least five other construct phrases that occur only once in the preserved fragments of the Songs, mostly in the remains of Song VIL These phrases, those appearing once and those that are repeated, are unique to the Songs and are not documented in other Hebrew sources from antiquity, with the sole exception of the phrase С?"Пр ТЭТ, which is rooted in a biblical verse (Ps 28:2). The significance of this datum is discussed below. The Evidence from Classical Hebrew The lexeme ТЭТ is well known in biblical Hebrew, and from a diachronic point of view it belongs to the classical stratum of the language.12 It occurs in the description of Solomon's temple where one also finds two construct phrases, each attested only MQ392 1 9: [гтпдоэл D-fcr 1зэЬо[ ifňi тпю[01 гэкЬо] D4p-m mrri["i пвд Di-юр чэ], translated by its final editor as follows: "[For on] high [he made w]inds and lightnings [his messengers and s]ervants of an inner sanctu[ary.] From his presence go forth the lu[minaries]."

As noted by Falk (ibid., 28, 31, line 9), the original editor of the text, John Striiglieli, deciphered the traces as 1]""O"T ТГЩй, "s]ervants of [His] word," rather than "l]4¿n ТП2?[й.

These phrases denote spatial features of the inner sanctum and testify to the technical nature of TD4 as an architectural term. A third construct phrase is the aforementioned ФТ1р ТПЧ found in only one attestation outside the historical books, in the poetic diction of biblical psalmody (Ps 28:2).13 Although ТЭТ falls in the field of priestly interest, it is not a priestly term from a stylistic point of view. It is found nowhere in P's detailed descriptions of the tabernacle or in the specifications of Ezekiel's temple. In priestly literature, both early and late, the innermost part of the shrine is termed О^СП^П tâlp "the holy of holies."14 What is more, D^ljpn tàlp is used in the book of Kings specifically to gloss the nonpriestly ТЭТ (1 Kgs 6:16; 8:6 // 2 Chr 5:7; see also 1 Kgs 7:50 // 2Chr4:22).15 One can argue, of course, that if ТЭТ is an architectural term referring to a permanent building, it may have been deemed unsuitable for the priestly tabernacle, which is a tent. But this argument does not apply to Ezekiel's temple, which is portrayed as a building like the one erected by Solomon. Furthermore, according to a plausible etymology, Hebrew аэЫг is cognate of Arabic dub(u)r, which means "back" or "hinder part,"16 and as such it would be appropriate for referring to the holiest part of the tabernacle as well.17 13 There is a single attestation of ТЭТ in the nonsynoptic portions of Chronicles (2 Chr 3:16; contrast 1 Kgs 7:17), but critical commentators are unanimous in taking the text of the verse as corrupted, and many emend the word ТЭТ2 to ТЭТЭ; see for instance Edward L. Curtis and Albert A. Madsen, A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Books of Chronicles (ICC 11; New York: Scribner, 1910) 329. 14 Exod 26:33, 34; Num 4:4, 19; Ezek 41:4. Note that when the expression is indeterminate, P applies it to various other sacred objects: the altar (Exod 29:37; 30:10, 29; 40:10), the incense (Exod 30:36; see also 1 Chr 6:34), various kinds of offerings (Lev 2:3; 6:10, 18, 22; 7:1, 6; 10:12, 17; 14:13; 24:9; Num 18:9; see further below, n. 53); in Ezekiel it extends to the entire temple complex (Ezek 43:12; 45:3; see also 48:12). In late biblical books, it is also applied to the priests (Dan 9:24; 1 Chr 23:13). 15 For a discussion of priestly terms employed in the book of Kings (or, more precisely, in the "temple chronicles" now embedded in Kings), see Meir Paran, Forms of the Priestly Style in the Pentateuch: Patterns, Linguistic Usage, Syntactic Structures (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1989) 309-29, esp. 325-26 [in Hebrew]. 16 Edward W. Lane, An Arabic-English Lexicon (8 vols.; London: Williams and Norgate, 1863-1893) 3:846a-b. 17 According to an alternative view, Hebrew ТЭТ is borrowed from Egyptian in which its putative origin can be defined by its accompanying determinatives "house" and "wood"; see Hermann Schult, "Der Debir im salomonischen Tempel," ZDPV 80 (1964) 46-54; John A. Tvedtnes, "Egyptian Etymologies for Biblical Cultic Paraphernalia," in Egyptological Studies (ed.

However, the Egyptian word alleged to be the source of the Hebrew term is now taken to be a West Semitic loan into Egyptian; see Daniel Sivan and Zipora Cochavi-Rainey, West Semitic Vocabulary in Egyptian Script of the 14th to the 10th Centuries ВСЕ (Beer Sheva 6; Beer Sheba: University Press, 1992) 32 (§ 2.1.2.1), 87 (no. 301).</page><page sequence="5">NOAM MIZRAHI 37 It is therefore safe to conclude that classical biblical Hebrew knows more than one term denoting the innermost part of the sanctuary. Priestly sources refer to it as D^Ompn ÜTlp, while nonpriestly sources call it TD"T.18 The nonpriestly term describes this space in respect to its physical properties, while the priestly term- when utilized to denote that space- does so by investing it with ideological import and encoding two notions of prime importance for ancient priestly circles: the idea of separation, embedded in the use of a lexeme derived from q-d-š, and the idea of hierarchy, expressed by a syntactic construction that conveys the notion of the superlative.19 By calling this space "the holy of holies," it is distinguished automatically from both "the holy," that is, the rest of the tabernacle or the temple, as well as from "the unholy," which pertains to the realm outside the compound of the sanctuary. The Evidence from Postclassical Hebrew A change in this state of affairs is perceptible in postexilic literature in which the classical, nonpriestly term was deemed obsolete and was replaced gradually by an alternative term, □''Empii Ì2H1p ÎTQ, "the house (or: the place) of the holy of holies."20 When viewed from a diachronic point of view, the evidence of the Songs poses a conspicuous problem. How can it be that the obsolete term TD4 - otherwise extremely rare in other Hebrew texts of the Second Temple period- is being used so extensively and that the number of its occurrences far exceeds the sum of its biblical attestations? Admittedly, this issue requires us to digress from our current discussion, yet it is worthwhile to pursue it because it will allow us to gain an insight into one of the fundamental factors that were operative in shaping the language of the Songs. Against the overwhelming absence of TO"! from both biblical and extrabiblical Hebrew sources of the Second Temple period, its occurrence in Sir 45:9 (according 18 That this terminological distinction is strictly kept throughout classical biblical Hebrew suggests that it reflects a certain cultural reality in which priestly texts were produced and circulated within a limited group and that their distinctive style was therefore characteristic to a specific scribal school. 19 Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar (ed. Emil Kautzsch; trans. Arthur E. Cowley; 2d ed.; Oxford: Clarendon, 1910) 431 § 133/; Paul Joiion and Takamitsu Muraoka, A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew (Subsidia Biblica 27; Rome: Pontifical Biblical Institute, 2006) 491 § 141/. 20 Thus, of eleven occurrences of TOT in the book of Kings, only three were left intact in the book of Chronicles. In other cases, the Chronicler either omitted the entire passage (1 Kgs 6:5, 16, 21, 22, 31), or replaced the term in question with its late equivalent (1 Kgs 6:19, 23 // 2 Chr 3:8, 10). The phrase D4t2mpn Sölip ГГ2 also prevails in early rabbinic literature, where T2"7 is practically nonexistent. The late phrase is based on the priestly term, but the construction bet X ("the place of X") is not used in classical priestly texts to designate parts of the tabernacle and its surroundings. On the other hand, it is widely used in postexilic and rabbinic Hebrew to denote various parts and sections of the temple (see Hurvitz, "Terms and Epithets"). The compound term D4Empn töT)p W2 is thus a clear marker of the postclassical period in which old terms are used as building blocks in otherwise new constructions.</page><page sequence="6">38 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW to ms в) as part of a description of Aaron's priestly garments stands out. As already noted by commentators, this passage alludes to Exod 28:33-35 (see also v. 29; 39:24-26) .21 The ТЭТ mentioned by Ben Sira, thus, parallels the "holy" mentioned in Exodus (which refers to the main hall of the tabernacle) rather than the innermost "holy of holies" into which the High Priest was allowed to enter only once a year, on the Day of Atonement. It is, therefore, clear that Ben Sira uses the term ТЭТ in a sense different from its usual denotation in classical biblical Hebrew.22 This semantic discrepancy may indicate that he used the word as part of his archaistic style, while in reality it was absent from his vernacular.23 May the same explanation be applied to the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice! While the assumption of an archaistic usage is an appropriate interpretation of the very use of the word, it does not adequately explain why ТЭТ was used so extensively in the Songs.24 By the same token, one cannot be completely satisfied with the argument that the use of the term ТЭТ is reminiscent of the literary dependence of the author of the Songs on the book of Kings.25 While this argument, again, is reasonable, it does not offer a real explanation for the great phraseological variation typical of the Songs.26 Furthermore, the only phrase shared by the two corpora is the poetic 2?Т1р ТЭТ, and not the more technical phrases attested in the book of Kings. One may therefore conclude that the language of the Songs 21 Moshe H. Segal, The Complete Book of Ben Sira (2d ed.; Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1958) 313-14 [in Hebrew] (vv. 13-15 according to his numeration); Rudolph Smend,Di¿ Weisheit des Jesus Sirach (3 vols.; Berlin: Georg Reimer, 1906) 2:431-32. See also Patrick W. Skehan and Alexander A. Di Leila, The Wisdom of Ben Sira (AB 39; Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1987) 511-12. 22 The word ТЭТ may be attested in another passage of Sirach: HD4 7Uft ^"ПМ ПП[ТТ] töQÖ "ИГЛ ТЭТЭ [ПС?]Х , which might be rendered as: "(like) the sun (that) shines in the height of heaven, (so is) a woman beautiful in a man's private chamber" (Sir 26:16 according to MS C; trans, and italics mine). But in this case the LXX is quite different, and no safe conclusion can be drawn from the Hebrew text. Even if the Hebrew reading is original, the meaning of ТЭТ does not correspond to its technical usage in classical biblical Hebrew; see Menahem Kister, "Genizah Manuscripts of Ben Sira," in The Cambridge Genizah Collections: Their Contents and Significance (ed. Stephan С. Reif; Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2002) 36-46, at 41-42. 23 The classical component has a central role in the language of Ben Sira, although some refrain from describing it as an "archaistic" usage and prefer to highlight the creative application (sometimes exegetically motivated) of biblical lexemes and expressions. See, for instance, Menahem Kister, "Some Notes on Biblical Expressions and Allusions and the Lexicography of Ben Sira," in Sirach, Scrolls, and Sages (ed. Takamitsu Muraoka and John F. Elwolde; STDJ 33; Leiden: Brill, 1999) 160-87; James K. Aitken, "Hebrew Study in Ben Sira's Beth Midrash," in Hebrew Study from Ezra to Ben Yehuda (ed. William Horbury; Edinburgh: T &amp; T Clark, 1999) 27-37. 24 As noted above, ТЭТ is found about thirty times in the Songs. For the sake of comparison, the total sum of its occurrences in biblical Hebrew is only sixteen. 25 Devorah Dimant, "The Apocalyptic Interpretation of Ezekiel at Qumran," in Messiah and Chris tos: Studies in the Jewish Origins of Christianity Presented to David Flus ser (ed.

By comparison only three phrases are found in biblical Hebrew, each attested only once.</page><page sequence="7">NOAM MIZRAHI 39 is conditioned by another factor, which sets it apart from both preceding and contemporary sources. The nature of this factor is best illuminated by a typological comparison with later linguistic strata. As already said, TD"f is almost never used in Tannaitic literature but is attested sporadically in Amoraic literature, which was produced when Hebrew was no longer spoken, and its usage was restricted to liturgical and scholastic contexts. Being mainly a literary medium, Amoraic literature was susceptible to the influence of biblical Hebrew, as the Hebrew Bible was central to Jewish spiritual and intellectual life. Indeed, ample evidence exists that classical words and forms found their way back to the lexis and grammar of late rabbinic Hebrew.27 While TD"f is only sparsely used in the prose sections of rabbinic literature or even totally absent from its early strata, it is well attested in the language of rabbinic prayers and poetry,28 including the famous Song of the Kine.29 The latter belongs to a larger corpus of short (perhaps fragmentary) poetic texts quoted in Amoraic literature, which are characterized by their unique linguistic texture.30 It is a mixture of both biblical and rabbinic elements, which are then fused together into innovative constructions.31 27 Michael Sokoloff, "The Hebrew of Běréšit Rabba according to MS. Vat. Ebr. 30," Leš 33 (1968-1969) 25-42, 135-49, 270-79, at 276-77 [in Hebrew]. Some rabbis were quite aware of this process as demonstrated by famous episodes in Talmudic literature dealing with the problem explicitly in relation to both lexis (b. Avodah Zarah 58b) and morphology (b. Hullin 137b). Seen in this light, it is little wonder that there are several occurrences of ТПЛ in Amoraic literature. Even so, however, these occurrences are restricted to only four contexts, and in two of them the word functions as an allusion to biblical texts. See, for instance, the rabbinic discussion of various epithets of the temple in y. Berakhot 4:5 8c (ed. Academy of Hebrew Language, 41) // GenR 54:7 (ed. Theodor and Albeck, 2.591) // CantR 4.4.9. Each of the terms discussed in this homily (]1DQ "established place," ЛЛ1ЙЛ "I Л "Mount Moriya," ] ЛХ "ark," TTT "shrine") is presented explicitly as a biblical appellation that requires a homiletic clarification. 28 See e.g., the seventeenth benediction of the 'Amida prayer: ПГПЭГт "p¿D 13TDX "n Л2Л ■рГПЗ "ПЛЬ Л TOU 32?m, "О Lord our God, acknowledge Your people and their prayer, and restore worship to the shrine of Your house" [trans, and italics mine]. Because of the problematic textual basis of printed editions of rabbinic literature, all quotations from rabbinic sources - including this one- are taken from Ma'agarim, the database of the Historical Dictionary of the Academy of Hebrew language (http://hebrew-treasures.huji. ac.il/), which uses reliable manuscripts. 29 See b. Avodah Zarah 24b // GenR 54:4 (ed. Theodor and Albeck, 2 .58 1-82) // Seder Eliyahu Rabba 11 (ed.

Some of these are biblical, while others are totally new. The most common collocation in Piyyut Hebrew is 2?"71p TD"T,33 which goes back to a single occurrence in the biblical psalmody. This fact suggests that it is the rarity of the biblical phrase, as well as its affiliation with biblical poetic diction, which were appealing to the rabbis who composed the liturgical poems. It is acknowledged that Piyyut literature preserves some traits of the living language spoken by earlier sages,34 and in some respects its language can be perceived as a direct continuation and further development of Rabbinic Hebrew.35 But on the whole, the piyyutim are highly stylized literary products of skilful poets of the Byzantine period,36 during which Hebrew was no longer spoken, and the vernaculars were Greek and a branch of Late Western Aramaic. As such, it is saturated with biblicisms, borrowed intentionally from Scripture, and with the creative poets' own neologisms. In their attempt to present innovative poetic substitutes for institutionalized prayers and bound by the rigid stylistic restriction of using only Hebrew (or Hebraized) words37- a principle that had a decisive role in shaping the language of Piyyuf*- they made use of whatever linguistic resource 32 As Mirsky has shown, these poems are forerunners of Byzantine Piyyut. But while the talmudic poems were used for various random functions, the piyyutim were used as fixed poetic substitutes for specific institutional liturgies and prayers; see Ezra Fleischer, "Piyyut," in The Literature of the Sages, Second Part (ed. Shmuel Safrai et al.; 2 vols.; Compendia rerum iudaicarum ad Novum Testamentům. Section 2, Literature of the Jewish People in the Period of the Second Temple and Talmud; 3b; Assen: Van Gorcum, 2006) 363-74, at 363-64. 33 The Ma 'agarim database records eight occurrences of this collocation in poems antedating Rav Saadiah Gaon (ninth-tenth cent. C.E.), whose influential poetics transformed Piyyut. 34 See e.g., Joseph Yahalom, Poetic Language in the Early Piyyut (Jeursalem: Magnes, 1985) 162-76 [in Hebrew]; Israel Yeivin, "The Contribution of the Piyyut Language to the Mishnaic Language," Massorot 9-11 (1997) 77-90 [in Hebrew]. 35 See especially Israel Yeivin, "Characteristic Linguistic Features of Piyyut Г in Studies in Hebrew and Jewish Languages: Presented to Shelomo Morag (ed. Moshe Bar-Asher; Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1996) 105-18 [in Hebrew]. For a recent grammatical description oí Piyyut Hebrew, from a selection of poems by Rabbi Elazar Qillir (presumably sixth cent. C.E.), see Michael Rand, Introduction to the Grammar of Hebrew Poetry in Byzantine Palestine (Piscataway, N.J.: Gorgias, 2006). 36 The implications of this characterization were emphasized by Ezra Fleischer, "The Cultural Profile of Eastern Jewry in the Early Middle Ages as Reflected by the Payyetanic Texts of the Geniza," in A Centuary of Geniza Research (ed.

The Hebrew Bible in general and its poetic books in particular naturally took pride of place in this regard. A mechanical linguistic survey of the vocabulary of Piyyut might look to the uninitiated as a hopeless conglomerate of elements of various sources, corpora, and chronolects, but when viewed from a stylistic perspective all these varied materials find their proper place in the ambitious and imaginative literary effort of rabbinic poets of Late Antiquity to shape a language that would fit its spiritually charged function of praying to God. When comparing the patterns of usage of the lexeme ТЭТ in the various Hebrew corpora, it is evident that even though the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice is a product of the Second Temple period, its language exhibits the greatest similarity to Piyyut over against any other Hebrew corpus from a typological point of view. The similarity extends to all aspects of the unique phraseological behavior of ТЭТ in the Songs: (a) the intensified use of the word in quantitative terms far beyond the biblical statistics; (b) its use as part of various nonbiblical phrases and collocations; and (c) its special link to biblical poetic diction as embodied in the borrowing of the psalmodie phrase ÎOTIp ТЭТ . This affinity suggests that as the Piyyut Hebrew is a product of literary stylization, so is the language of the Songs.39 Conclusion When viewed from a stylistic point of view, the extensive use of the the term ТЭТ in Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice is incompatible with the Songs' presumed priestly provenance, since the term ТЭТ never was part of priestly terminology but rather was characteristic of the nonpriestly descriptions of Solomon's temple in the book of Kings . Another noteworthy fact is that of the construct phrases attested in biblical Hebrew, the only one shared by the Songs is the psalmodie С£П1р ТЭТ. Thus the author of the Songs is dependent upon biblical sources that are nonpriestly in nature. 39 See further my forthcoming paper, "Aspects of Poetic Stylization in Second Temple Hebrew: A Comparison of the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice with Ancient Piyyut" in Hebrew in the Second Temple Period (ed. Moshe Bar-Asher, Steven E. Fassberg, and Ruth Clements; STDJ' Leiden: Brill, forthcoming). The similarity between the language of the Songs and Piyyut is restricted to the typological realm alone without extending it to the historical realm. The phraseological analysis of ТЭТ demonstrates that no direct link can be established between the two corpora. Rather than being historically linked, they seem to stem from a comparable literary effort to make intensive use of biblical-like Hebrew as a medium of liturgical devotion, since the Hebrew Bible- particularly its poetic sections - was perceived as a central source of spiritual inspiration. This literary effort may be part of a larger cultural construct that emerged among certain circles in the Second Temple period concerning the unique status of Hebrew as a "holy tongue" (4Q464 3 i 8); see Steven Weitzman, "Why Did the Qumran Community Write in Hebrew?"

Since D^töHp "holy ones" is a standard designation of the angels both in the Songs and elsewhere, the phrase П^ЕТПр TQT "sacrifices of the holy ones" (line 3) may refer to the role of the angels in performing the ritual of heavenly sacrificing.40 The text then goes on to utilize two expressions that are formulated in a similar manner: ПГЛГШ ГТН "the smell of their offerings" (line 3) and ОГРЭОЗ ПрЛ, "the smell of their libations" (line 4). These expressions merit closer attention. The Evidence from Classical Hebrew The word ГТИ, "smell" or "aroma," appears in the Hebrew Bible in various strata and genres,41 but its use in cultic contexts is restricted. From a phraseological point of view, it appears in the collocation ГПГПЗ ГТН when referring to sacrificial worship. One might add that the lexeme ГПГРЗ is attested in biblical Hebrew only as part of this collocation. From a stylistic point of view, almost all the occurrences of ГПГГЗ ITH are found in priestly literature.42 The only exception to this rule is ascribed to J, as part of its version of the flood story, but this one is nevertheless found in a description of a sacrifice: Then Noah built an altar to the Lord. He took ritually clean beasts and birds of every kind and offered whole-offerings on the altar. When the Lord smelt 40 This expression reflects, perhaps, angelological exegesis of the biblical phrase ОТтЪк "ТОТ (see especially Ps 5 1 : 17-21), interpreted as "sacrifices of (i.e., offered by) divine beings."

This passage is distinguished from P's style in two ways. First, the collocation ГТ1ГРЗ ГТИ is governed by the verb ITVl "and He smelled," which depicts God in a corporeal way that is almost unattested in P. Secondly, the collocation as a whole is determinate, having the definite article attached to the nomen rectum, while in P the collocation is often indeterminate- a fact that reveals its nature as a frozen expression. Of the dozens of occurrences of ГПГП ГТН in P, only two (Lev 26:31; Num 28:2) do not exhibit these two characteristics, and both of them were assigned on other grounds to a distinctive stratum within P.43 But from a formal linguistic perspective, they still differ from the form found in the nonpriestly J source, since in both cases the collocation is determinate by virtue of a pronominal suffix, while in J it is determinate by the definite article. Scholars have already noted that the linguistic differences between the Pentateuchal sources reflect a profound theological disagreement between them. Admittedly, J and P share an ancient corporeal concept, according to which God draws concrete satisfaction from offerings by inhaling the smoke produced by their burning. This concept is embodied in the very use of the word П1ГП, which may be derived from the root ГТ"1]44 and denotes the effect of calming the raging (or at least capricious) god.45 But while J presents this basic theological concept, P takes great pain to 43 Lev 26:31 is part of the Holiness Code. According to the classical view, which takes this literary document as an old source embedded in P, Lev 26:31 echoes an ancient anthropomorphic conceptualization, which was repressed in later strata of priestly literature (for this tendency see further below) . See Abraham Kuenen, An Historico-Critical Inquiry into the Origin and Composition of the Hexateuch (trans. Philip H. Wicksteed; London: Macmillan, 1886) 87-9 1 . According to the currently prevailing view, the Holiness Code belongs to a later stratum of priestly literature (which includes Num 28:2 as well) whose authors were not as reluctant to depict God in anthropomorphic terms, since they were trying to combine elite priestly conceptions with old popular traditions. See Israel Knohl, The Sanctuary of Silence: The Priestly Torah and the Holiness School (Minneapolis, Min.: Fortress, 1995) 170-72. For the assignment of Num 28:2b to the stratum labeled by Knohl as "the Holiness School," see ibid., 30. 44 For the formation of this word, see Jakob Barth, Die Nominalbildung in den semitischen Sprachen (Leipzig: J.C.

P's reservations regarding the content of the phrase ГПГР2 !TH did not prevent its utilization in this literary document. As said, this collocation is so common in P that it was recognized long ago as one of the distinctive markers of the priestly style.48 The frozen nature of this bound expression is therefore indicative of the linguistic conservatism of P, which continued to use fossilized expressions even when the concepts encoded in them were no longer a vital part of its worldview. This ambivalence characterizes priestly literature even in its late manifestations. Ezekiel, the prophet and priest, refrains from using the phrase ГПГР] ГТН in neutral cultic contexts, such as are found in P, and usually applies it to idolatrous rituals that he condemns aggressively (Ezek 6: 13; 16: 17-19; 20:28; contrast 20:41). From an ideological point of view, this usage may stem from an intensification of the trend that was at least partially operative in certain strata of priestly literature to depict God in less corporeal terms, but it is nevertheless instructive that the phrase ГПГПЗ ITH itself is still being employed. From a stylistic point of view, then, this is a second case of contrast between two modes of expression. Biblical priestly texts utilize the lexeme ITH in a restricted way, as part of the collocation ГЛГРЗ IT"), while the free usage of the lexeme ГГН is characteristic of nonpriestly sources. Typologically speaking, the usage found in the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice belongs to the second group, and this fact reveals its nonpriestly provenance. The Evidence from Postclassical Hebrew With due caution, I would like to propose that in this case one can advance beyond a mere typological classification of the Songs. Scrutiny of the linguistic evidence furnished by postexilic sources allows one to suggest that the usage of ГТН found in the Songs is based, in fact, on a misunderstanding of the original priestly term. offering (ППЗф ПТ "•? ^П^рГТ 'П Щ)" [trans, and italics mine]. The JPS rendered the last words aptly as "let Him be appeased by an offering" [italics mine] . 46 Knohl, Sanctuary of Silence, 132-35. 47 The verbs used in such contexts are ТИрЛ (e.g., Exod 29:25), 7VOÌ3 (e.g., Num 15:3), and rarely Tipil (e.g., Num 15:7). It has been argued that in the formula 4Th ГПГП ГР") , the preposition b has a genitive force, that is, that the "soothing odor" belongs to God (rather than the dative force, which would imply that it is addressed to God). Thus Pieter A. H. de Boer, "An Aspect of Sacrifice," in Studies in the Religion of Ancient Israel (VTSupp 23; Leiden: Brill, 1972) 27-47, at 47. But this argument is not compelling. 48 See, e.g., Joseph E. Carpenter and George Harford, The Composition of the Hexateuch (London: Longmans, 1902) 420 n. 158.</page><page sequence="13">NOAM MIZRAHI 45 In order to clarify this statement, I return to the book of Ezekiel. In one verse of this book, the lexeme ГПГРЗ is used in a way that differs from what one finds in the classical portions of the Hebrew Bible but is comparable to a feature of postexilic texts: "When I brought them to the land which I had sworn to give them, and they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, they slaughtered their sacrifices there and presented their offensive offerings there; there they produced their pleasing odors (рГРГПГРЗ ГГП) and poured out their libations" (Ezek 20:28 JPS). Unlike other attestations of ГПГП in biblical Hebrew, the word is used here in the plural. Such a phenomenon is otherwise found in the Bible only in Aramaic texts of the Persian period (Dan 2:46; Ezra 6:10).49 These Aramaic texts are characterized by yet another lexical peculiarity. They use ГПГРЗ as an independent lexeme, without recourse to the bound expression ГПГРЗ ITH . I propose that these phenomena are related, being products of a semantic change in ГПГРЗ. Several commentators and lexicographers have recognized that at least in the Aramaic text of Dan 2:46 the context requires one to render ]ТПГРЗ as "offerings": "and he worshiped Daniel and commanded to offer him a (grain) offering and nîhohînÇb ГООЗ.4? 1Щ 'рПГРЗ'] ПГШ!)."50 This recognition can be confirmed by comparing Dan 2:46 to verses in P where minhâ appears alongside various terms for offerings, for example: "You shall not offer alien incense on it or a burnt offering or a grain offering; and you shall not pour a libation on it (ГПЬр vbü ìbvri'ìib Vbç 1Э0П tib "[03*3 nTOî| п^1 rnj)"(Exod 30:9). Evidently ]ЧПГГ31 nmÇofDan 2:46 parallels ППЗ??1 пЬ'У of Exod 30:9, demonstrating that ]ТПГРЗ is synonymous with terms denoting offerings, such as Tlb'V. This explanation may at first glance be invalid for Ezra 6: 10, which looks as if it is in harmony with classical formulations found in P: Ezra 6: 10 №Щ ïïbtib ]ТТЙТЗ ]ч31рПС ]1пЬ 1 Lev 6:14 'пЪ ПГГЗ ГТП ППрП ОППЭ Щй Ч3ЧЭП Num 15:7 fib ПГГЗ ф"1 2П")|?П уПГ] ПЧСО*?СО "гЦЭЭЬ }"_) A closer inspection reveals, however, that the opposite is true. In P the real direct object of the verb mpn, "you shall sacrifice," is represented explicitly in the beginning of the sentence. The formula пЬ ГПП^З П*Н is therefore an appositive of this object which explicates its ritual purpose. By contrast, in Ezra 6:10 "¡ТПП"^ is the sole element in the sentence that is capable of functioning as the direct object of the verb, and it should be interpreted as referring concretely to the offering itself.51 49 This feature was noted by Hurvitz, Linguistic Study, 53-58. 50 See, e.g., HALOT 1930b, ГПГГ]. 51 The offerings themselves are specified in v. 9a, but this list forms an independent clause, and v. 10 does not constitute a direct continuation of Ezra 6:9a. The subject of the verb |1пЬ in v. 10 refers to "the priests" mentioned in v. 9b (or, less likely, to "these men" mentioned in v. 8) but not to the offerings specified in v. 9a.</page><page sequence="14">46 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW That the same concrete meaning might have been operative in Ezek 20:28 is demonstrated by the synonymous parallelism between ПГРГПГР2 ГТИ and the terms denoting various kinds of offerings: ПГРГПТ, D3D4p OJJD,52 and ПГРЭОЗ: ПГРГПТ Щ Щ2 irftfl And they offered there their sacrifices.

The semantic shift is responsible for the plural form; once the word was interpreted as denoting "an offering," it became susceptible to the influence of an analogy to the grammatical form of other terms from the same semantic domain, such as Wubtì (the so-called "peace-offerings") andD^TD? (offerings of "first fruits").53 The same features are attested in Qumran Hebrew, in which ГПГГЗ can be used freely as an independent word54 and can also be integrated into new construct phrases.55 A marked difference thus distinguishes classical from late texts. In the older stratum the term ГПГРЗ, which appears only as part of the collocation ГПГГЗ ГГН, denotes the purpose of the ritual act of offering a sacrifice. In contradistinction, in postclassical sources the term ГПГРЗ underwent a process of relexicalization. It is no longer bound in the old cultic formula but could be used as an independent lexeme denoting the offering itself. What is the reason for this semantic change? A possible answer is suggested by the wording of Dan 2:46, which couples 'рГПГРЗ with ППЗЕ, "gift, offering." This 52 The phrase D33"1p DID may to be interpreted as an inversion of Е0Ю p"lp, i.e., "their anger-offering" (compare Priestly terms such as "guilt-offering" and "sin-offering"), as suggested by Moshe Greenberg, Ezekiel: A NewTranslation with Introduction and Commentary (2 vols.; AB 22; Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1983-1997) 1:370. Note, however, that the whole stich D3D~lp OiíD DE? 13ГП is missing in the lxx, and it was taken to be a late interpolation by Walter Zimmerli, Ezekiel (trans. Ronald E. Clements and James D. Martin; 2 vols.; Hermeneia; Minneapolis, Minn.: Fortress, 1979-1983) 1:402. 53 Similarly, the general word tilft is appropriated in biblical Hebrew to denote "offerings" by being used in the plural form D42nj2 (see HALOT 1077, Щр, § 3). By the same token, when the superlative construction П^ЕЛ^Л Î0"7p appears in the plural as Оч5р'"7^Л "'фЛр it also denotes "offerings" (Lev 21:22; Ezek 42:13; see also Ezra 2:63 // Neh 7:65; 2 Chr 31:14); see above, n. 14. 54 See e.g., [. . .

According to this hypothesis, the old and obscure ГЛГР] , whose real etymology was no longer transparent, was erroneously equated with the more familiar ППЗЕ,56 and the two terms were eventually used as by-forms.57 That the same semantic shift is reflected in both postexilic Hebrew and biblical Aramaic does not necessarily mean that it originated in Aramaic. In fact, in this case the opposite is more probable, namely, that the Aramaic usage is a Hebraism. This is indicated by two details. First, the lexeme ГПГП is attested only in Aramaic texts whose authors were also familiar with Hebrew and were therefore exposed to its influence. Secondly, a grammatical trait betrays Hebrew influence. According to Bauer and Leander, the original nominal pattern of this word is *qatlãl.5S According to the sound change known as the Canaanite Shift, the reflexes of the accented ä vowel in the second syllable are expected to be [э] in Aramaic and [o] in Hebrew, but in this instance the Aramaic form is vocalized with an [o] vowel, as in Hebrew.59 Therefore, the Aramaic usage may be a caique of a Hebrew development that occurred during the transition period between classical and late biblical Hebrew. In order to keep my discussion focused on the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, I shall not discuss here in detail the occurrences of ГПГР] in Qumran Hebrew in general but shall limit myself to one observation. The Qumran texts reflect two contradictory tendencies. On the one hand, they manifest late lexical and phraseological traits, which are best explained as resulting from the semantic change recorded in late biblical texts. On the other hand, there is a recognizable effort to model contemporary diction on classical biblical style. Thus, for instance, there is an instructive correction in the Community Rule: ГПГРЭ nn D'Hpbi, "and to offer (the)smellof nihďh" (1QS 8:9). The scribe originally used the word ГПГП alone, as common in Second Temple Hebrew, but a later hand added ITH to make it conform to classical biblical usage.60 The shorter version is obviously the original one, not only because it is attested in another textual witness of the work (4Q259) but also because the term in question is governed by the verb З'НрЬ, "to offer" (with the syncope of the consonant he of the H stem).61 56 For analysis of this term, see Gary A. Anderson, Sacrifice and Offering in Ancient Israel: Studies in Their Social and Political Importance (HSM 41; Atlanta, Ga.: Scholars, 1987) 27-34. 57 One should not overlook the socio-linguistic implication of this change. It can be explained as being rooted in a literary and cultural process by which old priestly material, originally confined to a limited and conservative circle, eventually became accessible to a larger, less pedantic audience. The antiquated priestly terminology was then submitted to new appropriations, which eventually blurred its original semantics and restricted range of usage. 58 Hans Bauer and Pontus Leander, Grammatik des Biblisch-Aramäischen (Halle: Niemeyer, 1927; Hildesheim: Olms, 1969) 193 § 51/'". 59 Note that this is indicated not only by the diacritical vocalization- which arguably reflects an oral tradition submitted to writing only at a relatively late period- but also by the use of plene spelling in Ezra 6:10. 60 See Hurvitz, Linguistic Study, 58 n. 1 1 . 61 This kind of archaizing may be responsible for several occurrences of the classical collocation</page><page sequence="16">48 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Conclusion One can now reassess the phrases ОГЛПЗй ГГ"1 "the smell of their offerings" and ОГРЭОЗ ПГЛ "the smell of their libations" in the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice. Newsom correctly noted that these formulations digress from the biblical collocation of ГТ1ГРЗ m , but her explanation of this fact is basically theological. She believes that the Songs alters the biblical expression deliberately. It alludes to a cultic context by utilizing the word 1TH but omits П1ГРЗ in order to distance the cult performed in the heavenly shrine from the one taking place in the earthly temple.62 This explanation, however, is quite unlikely given the tendency reflected in other contemporary works- which Newsom herself pointed out- to describe the rituals of both heavenly and earthly temples using the same terms and figures of speech. By contrast, the usage attested in the Songs is easily explicable by the linguistic evidence presented above. For a Hebrew author of the Greco-Roman period, ГПГГЗ was equivalent to ППЗй and "]03. In other words, for such an author, a direct line leads from ОГГтгГЗ ITI in Ezekiel to ОПИТО ГП and DÎTD03 ПрП in the Songs. These two phrases are secondary appropriations of the old cultic term in which the late- and ultimately incorrect- understanding of ГПГРЗ is realized by means of lexical substitution. Rather than representing a direct continuation of the classical usage, the Songs' adaptation of the collocation ГПГПЗ ÎTH is therefore another piece of evidence for a fundamental discontinuity between the genuinely archaic terminology pertaining to the cult (as preserved in priestly literature) and the archaistic and pseudoclassical employment of the same lexemes (as reflected in the Songs). ■ imo nbiQQ The Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice The third and final case is the expression "îmtû PÒIQQ, which is another term that typifies the distinct phraseology of the Songs.

Newsom correctly noted that the lack of grammatical agreement at least in the third quotation (and perhaps also in the second one) indicates that the collocation "imo nblftft is already a frozen expression in the language of the Songs.63 Indeed there is no doubt that it is borrowed from a specific biblical verse, for the participle nbiQft is documented in biblical Hebrew in a single place, the priestly recipe of the ПГЕО rmtüp "spice incense," designated for use within the tabernacle, as opposed to the regular, unqualified "incense," which is used in the outer court (Exod 30I34-38):64 (34) And the Lord said to Moses: Take spices- stačte, onycha, and galbanum- spices and pure frankincense; let there be an equal part of each (ЛТГ 133 "Q).

Both пЬчйЪ and lîTIÛ are in the singular, yet in the third quotation the collocation functions as the modifier of ПГПЗШЕ biD, which is in the plural. Similarly, in the second quotation, it may be the modifier of ÍÒD ^V2)¿, but it can also be taken as referring to П313 ^Vfc , in which 42? JJU may in fact be a phonetic spelling of the singular form. For the latter point, see Elisha Qimron, The Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls (HSS 29; Atlanta, Ga.: Scholars, 1986) § 100.34, 137 addendum to § 100.34; idem, "A Review Article of Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifices: A Critical Edition by Carol Newsom," HTR 79 (1986) 349-71, at § 1.1.1.2. 64 For P's distinction between these two kinds of incense, see Menahem Haran, Temples and Temple-Service in Ancient Israel (Oxford: Clarendon, 1978; repr. Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1985) 241-45. The English translation of the passage follows jps with some alterations in v. 34a.</page><page sequence="18">50 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW The Evidence from Classical Hebrew There are two significant differences between the biblical form of the phrase and its appropriation in the Songs.65 Syntactically, the cantillation marks make it clear that in the biblical text the three words 2Л1р "IIHtD пЬ*'йй are three independent modifiers of Пр*П ПЮУй "the product of an expert blender."66 Semantically, the word nbiuu refers to the use of salt as one of the ingredients of the incense and may thus be rendered as "salted."67 It is obvious, however, that these two features of the biblical usage do not apply to the Songs. The passages quoted above present no connection with the incense and its ingredients; rather they seem to refer to the visual aspect of certain objects found in the heavenly temple. Semantically, then, it is difficult to interpret the expression "imtû ròlftft the same way it is functioning in Exodus, and it is virtually impossible to connect the two usages by assuming standard semantic changes (such as by way of figurative use). Syntactically, the words Г'Ь)йй and "lîTItû are taken as a single unit (perhaps as a construct phrase), and their relation is therefore different from the way that they are construed in the biblical verse. The inescapable conclusion is that the usage documented in the Songs represents a specific interpretation of the biblical text, not a linguistic continuation of it. While the exact nature of this interpretation and the identification of its source and motivation remain a matter of speculation, the evidence indicates an insurmountable gap between the original sense of the term as employed in P and its application in the Songs, and no direct and continuous relation between the two can be entertained. The collocation 4ÍT1Ü nbiQQ is therefore added to the previous examples that demonstrate the difference in usage and meaning of certain expressions as found in genuine priestly texts on the one hand and their secondary employment in the Songs on the other- a difference that marks a fundamental discontinuity between the two literary corpora. The Proposed Development in Postclassical Hebrew The above conclusion stands in its own right and needs no further corroboration. Nevertheless, one cannot end the discussion of "1ГПй ròlftft without attempting to 65 1 disregard the conspicuous difference, which is misleading. In the biblical text, the form used is seemingly the adjective Т1ПВ, while in the Songs the form "1ГПй looks like a noun. However, this may not be a grammatical difference but rather a purely orthographical one. The Dead Sea scrolls testify to a considerable weakening in the pronunciation of [h] , and in fact the phonetic realization of both forms in Qumran Hebrew was perhaps identical; see Qimron, Hebrew, § 200.1 l;addendum to § 200.11; idem, "Review Article," § 1.1.2.1; § 3.12. See also Newsom, Songs, 298; eadem, "4QShirot," 342. Hence, no formal distinction between these two forms can be established on the basis of spelling. 66 Compare Rashi, Miqra'ot Gedolot 'HaKeter' : Exodus (ed. Menahem Cohen; 2 vols; Ramat- Gan: Bar-Пап University Press, 2007) 2:130. 67 This interpretation is corroborated by Akkadian parallels adduced from ritual texts and incantations; see Victor A. Hurowitz, "Salted Incense: Exodus 30,35; Maqlû VI 1 1 1-13; IX 1 18-20," Biblica 68 (1987) 178-94.</page><page sequence="19">NOAM MIZRAHI 51 explain its perplexing usage in the Songs. It may be stressed at the outset, however, that the main conclusion- namely, that there is no essential relation between the Songs and priestly literature- is not dependent upon the results of the interpretative attempt that follows. Furthermore, the linguistic and exegetical problems raised by this case are so complicated that no solution can be offered with certainty. Rather than presenting a single, firm solution, I therefore propose two tentative reconstructions of the development of the tantalizing usage attested in the Songs. 6S The gap between the literal meaning of П*?Еф in Exodus and its application in the Songs is in fact reflected in other sources stemming from the Greco-Roman period, notably the ancient versions, which render the word П^Сф in Exod 30:35 as "mixed" rather than "salted."69 This rendition is surprising, since there is no obvious semantic or grammatical difficulty in nbiftft that would justify such a translation.70 In addition, that the versions basically reflect the same interpretation does not allow one to assume that the ancient translators followed the well-known procedure of etymological rendition of an obscure Hebrew word, since in such cases each version reflects its own unique derivation. One can also discount the possibility that the versions were influenced by another common phenomenon, that is, confusion with homonyms. While nbiftft is a denominative from Tlbft (with a pharyngeal h), the other U"bt2 found in Hebrew is with a velar h, and it denotes attrition and grinding (see e.g., Jer 38:11-12)- two features that render it irrelevant for the explanation of the ancient versions (and the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice).11 68 Some of the sources discussed below were already survey by Jean Carmignac, "Le sens de la racine MLH II dans la Bible et a Qumran," in Studi sulV Oriente e la Bibbia. Offerti al p. Giovani Rinaldi (Genova: Studio e Vita, 1967) 77-81, who concludes that Г'Ь)йй needs to be interpreted as "vapor, aroma." But his discussion follows inaccurate or even wrong data and cannot be relied upon. For instance, he asserts in passing that mallãh "sailor" is derived from mélah "salt," even though the former is not a Semitic word but rather a loanword from Sumerian (má.lahA/5) via Akkadian (malãhu, malahhu). 69 lxx: (ie|iiY|j.évov, Vulg: mixtum diligenter, Pesh: rdl^La, Targ. Onq.' HH1?U, Neoph:. DTftft, Ps-Jon.: mUQ TTDft. See Hurowitz, "Salted Incense." 70 Admittedly, the passive D stem is in decline in Second Temple Hebrew, but the opposite is true for its nominal derivation, namely, the participle. The maquttãl pattern is productive in postclassical Hebrew, especially in adjectives; see Hurvitz, Linguistic Study, 27-30. See also Ze'ev Ben-Hayyim, "The Samaritan Tradition and Its Relation to the Linguistic Tradition of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Rabbinic Hebrew," Leš 22 (1958) 223-45, at 236-42 [in Hebrew]. 71 Jonah Ibn Janah considered the possibility to interpret П^Сф in Exod 30:35 according to Arabic &lt;a.}Lo "beauty" and ^-J-o "beautiful" in Sepher Haschoraschim. Wurzelwörterbuch der hebräischen Sprache von Abulwalîd Merwân Ibn Ganâh (R. Jona)- Aus dem Arabischen in's Hebräische übersetzt von Jehuda Ibn Tibbon (ed. Wilhelm Bacher; Berlin: Itzkowski, 1 896) 263 . Admittedly, this interpretation is not impossible, since figurative usages of words denoting tastes and flavors are well documented in various languages; see, for instance, Christiane Perrichet-Thomas, "La symbolique du sel dans les textes anciens," in Mélanges Pierre Leveque (ed. Marie-Madeleine Mactoux and Evelyne Geny; 9 vols.; Paris: Belles Lettres, 1993) 7:287-96. The reverse development is also attested in the Semitic languages: the Akkadian word for "salt," tãbtu, is derived from tabu "good" (cf. CAD,T, 15a). Nevertheless, Ibn Janah 's explanation does not seem to fit in this specific case, since the meaning "beauty" may be an inner- Arabic development (as demonstrated by the Arabic proverb quoted by</page><page sequence="20">52 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW The versions of Exod 30:35 can be joined with Sir 49: 1 (MS в): ГПйрЭ 1Г7 W DE? Пр1"1 TOUft пЬййП D4QÖ "Josiah's name is like spice incense, which is тэтиШН (as) a product of an expert blender." This verse is a transparent allusion to Exod 30:35, and its theme is clear enough. It compares the name of Josiah (that is, his reputation) to a fragrant perfume (compare Eccl 7:1a), suggesting that he is rightly famous for his lawful deeds.72 But this theme is not served by rendering ГОООЛ as "salted,"73 and the word order makes it reasonable to interpret the word as "mixed." In fact, this is exactly the way in which it was understood by the Syriac translator: голтэл rťo'ar£*_^rt=j J^Ajj.t rtíisnsti tó*t*_a uyrť rf% ycu.t cela*., "Josiah's name is like spice incense, which is mixed of many spices."74 The consensus of both direct and indirect witnesses indicates that the interpretation of nbiftft as "mixed" is rooted already in the early Hellenistic period (or perhaps even earlier than that), but it does not offer us a clue about its source and original motivation. Hurowitz suggested tentatively that it reflects a theological concern. Perhaps at some point during the Second Temple period, adding salt to the incense was perceived as a pagan rite, and from that point on the priests of the Jerusalem temple ceased doing so. The explicit biblical instruction was then reinterpreted in a way that would obscure the original intent of the text. But this is a conjecture that has no substantiation. Now, already in the initial publication of some Songs fragments, John Strugnell felt that the meaning "mixed" or "blended" is appropriate for the occurrences of Ibn Janah himself); hence it cannot be applied to Hebrew. In later strata of Hebrew, nblftQ is indeed used figuratively, but it means "smart, clever," not "beautiful" or "pleasant" as in Arabic. See for instance b. Qiddushin 29b: ЛТГГ ЧТ1 ЛПЬ DTlp *Ш - "ПаЬЬ 1Ш "ПОЬЬ К1ГТ :]П1 13П IQTlp УП - . . .[iÒlQft :Х"2] nblQQI Г1Т 132 DX riQÏK, "Our Rabbis taught: If he has himself to study and his son to study, he takes precedence over his son. R. Judah said: If his son is agile and clever [alternative reading: full (of Torah)]. . ., his son takes precedence over him"; see also Kallah Rabbati 3:1 . Mase khtot Kalah (ed. Michael Higger; New York: Hotsa'at "De-be Rabanan," 1936; repr. Soncino, 1965) 212-15. The word PÒIQQ (or ÌÒ1QQ) is not found in the older, Tannaitic formulation of the dictum (t. Bekhorot 6:3) - a fact that suggests that this figurative use developed in Hebrew only at a very late date. 72 The form ГИОЕЛ may stand in grammatical agreement with irnOX4 DtD, "Josiah's name" (both being in the masculine singular), but if it is a frozen expression (as in the Songs), it may be a modifier of the feminine D^ftO ГЛСОр "spice incense." 73 Nevertheless, it was mechanically understood in this way by some scholars, such as Nuria Calduch-Benages, "Aromas, perfumes y fragancias en el libro de Ben Sira," in Treasures of Wisdom: Studies in Ben Sira and the Book of Wisdom- Festschrift M . Gilbert (ed. Nuria Calduch-Benages and Jacques Vermeylen; BETL 143; Leuven: Peeters, 1999) 15-30, at 25 (I thank Dr. Ronnie Goldstein for assisting me in reading this Spanish paper). 74 In this case the Greek version (Mvr||xócruvov Igogíoi) eíç aúvGeaiv 6г)иш|шхос éaiceDCiauévov ёрую ßvpey/ov) is not helpful, since it may not render пЬоЕГТ but rather may offer a double rendition of Пр"Л. Note that in Ezek 24:10, the Hebrew word ЛП^ПЗЛ seems to be rendered as CKevaoia by Theodotion; see Frederick Field, Origenis Hexaplorum quae super sunt (Oxford: Clarendon, 1875) 2.834.</page><page sequence="21">NOAM MIZRAHI 53 "imíD ròiftft in the Songs,15 and his insight was embraced by Carol Newsom.76 But neither scholar knew how to interpret the word in its actual contexts. I would like to propose that since they searched for literal parallels, that is, comparable verbatim usages, they did not notice that interpreting ròlftft as "mixed" establishes an essential link between it and a specific legal realm: the laws forbidding D^iÒ? "admixtures" (Lev 19:19; Deut 22:9-11). In the Pentateuch in general, and in P in particular, admixtures were taken as markers of holiness. This is why such admixtures were forbidden in daily life, while they characterize the fabrics and textiles used for the tabernacle and priestly garments, especially those relating to the innermost cultic sphere, such as the garments of the High Priest.77 The obvious question is: What can the connection be between the recipe of the spice incense and the laws of admixtures? From a legal point of view, the instructions are not as unrelated as they seem to be at first glance. There is a basic structural similarity in the conceptualizations embedded in these instructions. Both etymologically and morphologically the Hebrew term D^iÒD encodes the notion of joining two species, such as two kinds of yarn or two kinds of animals. The same principle is applied to the spice incense. This incense is distinguished from the regular one by being produced from two basic components: ПЭТ njD^I Ü"1?? "spices and pure frankincense," and it can be defined accordingly as an "admixture."78 Ancient Jewish interpreters, then, could have identified a conceptual analogy between the spice incense and sacred textiles such as the veil, the garments of the High Priest, and other objects that were in use the closer one gets to the "holy of holies." By representing the word llbiftft in translational equivalents meaning "mixed," the translators gave lexical expression to such a legal interpretation, which 75 John Striiglieli, "The Angelic Liturgy at Qumran: 4Q Serek Sîrôt 'Ôlat Haššabbat," in Congress Volume: Oxford 1959 (VTSupp 7; Leiden: Brill, 1960) 3 1 8-45 , at § 17. This understanding was unjustifiably rejected by Fletcher-Louis, All the Glory of Adam, 364-65 and n. 20. 76 Newsom, "Shirot 'Olat HaShabbat," 342. 77 Haran, Temples, 1 60-63 ,210-12; Jacob Milgrom, Le viticus: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (3 vols.; AB 3; New York: Doubleday, 1991-2001) 2: 1656-65. For a different view of this issue, see Baruch J. Schwartz, The Holiness Legislation: Studies in the Priestly Code (Jerusalem: Magnes , 1 999) 324-28 [in Hebrew] ; following Cornelis Houtman , "Another Look at Forbidden Mixtures ," VT 34 (1984) 226-28. Philip P. Jenson, Graded Holiness: A Key to the Priestly Conception of the World (JSOTSupp 106; Sheffield: Academic, 1992) 85-87 mixes different explanations uncritically and assumes a systematic conceptualization that is quite alien to the biblical texts themselves. 78 Exod 30:34 enumerates three spices as ingredients of the incense (ПЗЗТТП ГПГК01 ^£33), but they are considered together as a single component, namely, D400 "spices." This is indeed indicated by the syntax of the verse. By repeating the word D^ftO "spices," the list of ПЗЗЬГП ГППСЛ грЗ is taken as a parenthetic clause, which is an appositional specification of D4Q0; compare the keen observation of the medieval commentator R. Samuel ben Meir (Rashbam) in Martin I. Lockshin, Rashbam 's Commentary on Exodus: An Annotated Translation (Atlanta, Ga.: Scholars, 1997) 388-89.

In both cases the mixture produces something that is holy, and for this reason the product may not be used in daily life. The restriction on the use of the spice incense is stated in Exod 30:37: ПйЬ ЩП ÍÒ ППЗЭПОЭ ТО1?П itíK rnbjprn 'ïïb ^b ГРПГ) tìlp "But when you make this incense, you must not make any in the same proportion for yourselves; it shall be held by you sacred to the Lord" (jps). Similarly, the forbidding of mixture is explained in Deut 22:9 in the following manner: ПКЬСП ЕПрП ]Э СГКЬэ **'£ГО !ЛТП iÒ," You shall not sow у our vineyard with by an admixture, lest what ripens becomes sacred." This legal conceptualization may underlie the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice as well, and by assuming it, one is able to explain the syntactic peculiarity of the expression ЧГПСЭ nb)¡2ft in this work. While in the biblical text the words nbiftft and "imtD are two independent syntactic units, they are taken as a single unit in the Songs. This joining is easily explained, however, on the assumption that P's instruction concerning the spice incense was understood as conveying the notion that an admixture (ròlftft) is sacred (ЧГПй).79 1 therefore propose that the meaning of "imtD nVlûû as employed in the Songs was determined on conceptual analogy with the notion of admixtures in general and with the holy fabrics used for the tabernacle and priestly garments in particular. Some support for this hypothesis may be found in an additional detail. The holy fabrics just mentioned are never termed D^iÒD, but their mixed nature is evident from their description as being woven from various kinds of thread. They are classified in P in three categories, designated respectively by three technical terms: ЗШ ПСГС "the product of a skilled workman," Dj?h П&amp;ГС "the product of an embroiderer," and ЛК ЩУй "the product of a weaver."80 These fabrics are also characterized by their colorful appearance, the natural outcome of using various textiles. Surely it is no coincidence that in the passages of the Songs the collocation "irntD PÒlftft is often used in conjunction with these and other terms pertaining to textiles: • Song XII: O&gt;mCD n^lQQ *Ò2 "»ina TO ПОрЛП ПЗД 'Wöl And the workmanship of [l]ight with glorious embroidery, wondrous colors, тэтиИак tohar (4Q405 J 20-21 [= frg. 20 ii-22 11 '-12']). 79 While holiness (q-d-š) and purity (t-h-r) are not identical, they do overlap in ritual contexts.

The last two passages are taken from Song XIII, which may describe the wondrous garments of the angels who serve as High Priests in the heavenly temple. This association indicates that a linkage between the priestly garments and the spice incense was indeed established in the exegetical consciousness of author of the Songs. Furthermore, it may be taken as an indication that the phrase "ìmtD ròlftft was understood not merely in a general way as meaning "mixed" but as having the more specific sense of being "mixed in color," that is, "colorful."81 This conclusion, if correct, is suggestive in its own right. It allows one to entertain the possibility that the link between the spice incense and the priestly garments is not only the result of an abstract conceptual analogy but is rather anchored in a lexical interpretation of a specific term. The original context of the phrase "imo vbiufc is an instruction about how to prepare □''QO mitûp , but in Rabbinic Hebrew the lexeme DO acquired the meaning "pigment, color, dye."82 Given this fact, I am inclined to propose that the semantic shift in the meaning of nblftft ultimately results from an anachronistic and atomistic interpretation of Exod 30:35. The term D4Q0 was understood by the author of the Songs as referring to "colors" in accordance with a meaning of that lexeme that was current in his vernacular.83 81 Since the collocation imtû rÒlftft is applied in the Songs to the visual aspect of certain cultic objects in the heavenly realm, it may also connote "brightness, shiny appearance" (see Exod 24: 10) - this sense may be metonymically related to the notion of purity and could also be interpreted as related to "1ПТ.

The latter is nothing but a secondary and incorrect interpretation of the former. Conclusion The literal meaning of the word П*7ОЭ, "salted," in Exod 30:35 is not represented in the ancient versions, which render it instead as "mixed." This exegetical tradition is also reflected in the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, but its usage there is restricted, both semantically (by being applied specifically to mixed colors) and idiomatically (by taking "imtD пЬ)йй as a bound expression). I have suggested two possible explanations for this situation. According to the first, this usage is a product of a conceptual analogy between the priestly instruction concerning the spice incense and the legal notion of D^iÒD . According to the second, it is a result of an atomistic lexical interpretation of the word D^QO as "colors." These two explanations are not mutually exclusive, and they may be taken as complementary ways in which the author of the Songs could have attributed such a divergent meaning to the biblical expression. But even if both proposals are rejected, it is evident that the usage attested in the Songs does not represent an outgrowth of the original priestly usage of the expression discussed above. Rather, it derives from a nonliteral exegesis that manipulates the biblical words in a way that reflects disregard for the original meaning and context of the terms in question. ■ General Conclusion The common denominator of the three examples discussed above- as well as many others not mentioned84- is the marked linguistic and stylistic difference between the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice and biblical priestly literature. It is no surprise that numerous linguistic elements in the Songs betray a late linguistic background, for there is no doubt that this work was composed during the Second Temple period. But anyone who claims that the Songs is affiliated with ancient priestly literature needs to explain why the author of the Songs refrains from using the classical priestly stock of expressions (as in the case of ГПГП ÎTH) and prefers to use nonpriestly until the final period and established eternal enmity between their parties" (1QS 4:16; see also line 25). Jacob Licht noted that the adverbial expression "ПЗ 12 is directly borrowed from Exod 30:34, but it is used there in a different sense. Licht, The Rule Scroll (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1965) 102 [in Hebrew]. In Exodus the phrase is best taken as meaning "part by part," that is, "in equal parts," while in the Community Rule, it means "one alongside the other"; the latter meaning, however, is not taken out of the blue but rather reflects a usage documented in Rabbinic Hebrew: ЦПЭ"7 4KQ ]4poim 122 "п "рп^та пчоэп *тйЬг' bv Drrwito nxis* bu ain "òkidi алпл Ьк mrï Л TIPO "What is (the meaning of what is) written, 'A sword is upon the baddîm and they shall become fools' [Jer 50:36]?

Makkot 10a; Ta'anit 7a). 84 For analysis of many other such examples, see Noam Mizrahi, "The Lexicon and Phraseology of the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice" (Ph.D. diss.; Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2008).</page><page sequence="25">NOAM MIZRAHI 57 terms (as in the case of TD"i). If he was a descendent or an heir of ancient priestly circles, how could he transform and obscure the transparent wording of technical instructions (as in the case of ЧГПв PlbiQQ) in such a radical way that its relation to the original context can hardly be recovered? Such queries are dulled if one recognizes that the assumption underlying the problem is in fact anachronistic. The author of the Songs had no special relation to the priestly literature because no such literature- as a distinct and recognizable body of texts- was ever available to him. He was influenced by biblical literature, and this influence extends to various strata and sections of the Hebrew Bible. His work bears clear marks of the impression made by the Pentateuch and the book of Ezekiel, but it was also inspired by the books of Kings and Psalms and by other biblical books and exegetical traditions (some of which can no longer be recovered).85 One of the characteristic features of the Songs is its eclecticism; it is a mosaic of vocables and locutions, building blocks collected from various biblical sources (whose original connection is often weak or even nonexistent). This is one of the many respects in which this composition is a typical product of the Second Temple period. Was the author of the Songs a priest? We shall perhaps never know the answer to this question, but even if he was, there is no indication in the language and style of his work that he had direct access to authentic priestly sources, other than those embedded in biblical literature.86 This conclusion can be interpreted in two ways. One possibility is to deny the priestly provenance of the Songs completely; the author's preoccupation with themes pertaining to the temple, the heavenly priesthood and the cult may then be interpreted as reflecting another spiritual trend, which has nothing to do with "real" priestly circles and worldview. An alternative possibility is to maintain the argument that the Songs stems from a priestly provenance, but this would entail a profound and far-reaching change of the definition of this notion as applied to the Second Temple period. If the Songs is a priestly work, then it represents a cultural phenomenon and a social circle that are divorced from a special connection to the communities underlying biblical priestly literature. A decision on this matter cannot be made on the basis of linguistic evidence alone, and it is up to historians to integrate the above conclusions into a comprehensive understanding of the intricate cultural and social reality of the Second Temple period. 85 A similar conclusion was reached by Alexander, Mystical Texts, 59-61 , although his general approach to the issue discussed here is quite different. 86 In this respect the Songs can be contrasted to the book of Ezekiel, which draws from authentic - yet independent- priestly traditions and style and may therefore be seen as a late outgrowth of priestly literature; see Menahem Haran, "The Law-Code of Ezekiel XL-XLVIII and Its Relation to the Priestly School," HUCA 50 (1979) 45-71, at 59-71; idem, "Ezekiel, P, and the Priestly School," VT58 (2008) 211-18.</page></plain_text>
