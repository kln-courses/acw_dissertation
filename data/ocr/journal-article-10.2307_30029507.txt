<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON SPATIAL DEIXIS IN MELANAUt Iain Clayre University of Edinburgh 1. Introduction 2. The directional system in Dalat Melanau 3. Dialectal differences 4. Comparison with other languages 5. Conclusions 1. 0. It is axiomatic that a people will develop a language (or languages) adequate to the needs of their cultural situation. The Whorf hypothesis2 suggests that, once the language exists, it will have a marked effect on the way members of that speech-community can speak or even think about the world in which they live. It is my purpose in these notes to demonstrate such connections between the systems of direction, location and related motion terms of the Melanau language and the riverine world which Melanaus, in general, inhabit. The main attention of the article will be directed towards the systems as they are found in the dialect of Dalat, a riverside town in a central position of the Melanau region. Problems are discussed which arise when the essentially river-orientated terms fail to make distinctions relevant to a local situation. Differences in the systems of related dialects are mentioned where they help to illuminate the overall pattern in the Melanau language, and correspond- ing facets in the grammar of an unrelated language provide additional illustra- tion of the suggested connection. Some of the cited dialect differences are put forward as evidence in support of local legends regarding the origins of the Melanaus. i. i. The Melanau peoples occupy a belt of low-lying coastal land stretch- ing from the delta of the Rejang River in the south-west to the Baram River in the north-east (see sketch map), with a depth inland varying with the terrain from a matter of a few miles to perhaps fifty miles at the most. In many ways they appear to fall into three clusters of related groups, the southern principal- ly occupying the Rejang delta itself and spreading up that river inland until they give place to Ibans and Chinese settlers, the northern group settled on the rivers of the Fourth Division and related more closely to hill tribes much further inland, and a central group within which the Dalat dialect occupies a fairly pivotal position. Isolated settlements of Melanaus are to be found muc:h 7t</page><page sequence="2">72 anthro linguistic vol. 15 no.2 rajang RAJANG MATU maku sibu nangka igan river oyar igan kuc iqan medong dalat dalat oya kanowit rejang river TANJONG mukan r. mukah siteng mukan balingian r. kabit rapids pelagus rejang R.

In all they may number as many as 100, 000. The Melanau language has received scant attention even within the field of Malayo-Polynesian linguistics. The name Milano appears on maps as far back as the 17th century3 in much the same position as that which they occupy now, and a broad survey of Bornean languages by Ray in the earlier part of the present century lists words of several Melanau dialects along with those of more than a hundred other speech-communities in the island. Beyond the restricted (though detailed) work of one Catholic missionary and one Admin- istrative officer whose disparate interests were each with one particular dialect, 4 virtually no scholarly attention or analytical work has been published. Literature in Melanau is almost non-extant, and such as there is suffers from the lack of any adequate orthography for even one of the many dialects. The spoken language, however, has a strong emotional hold on most Melanaus, dialectal differences serving to identify a speaker as a member of a particular river community. The National Language appears unlikely to dominate the everyday use of the vernacular, whatever its unifying effects may be on the administration of Malaysia as a whole. 1. 2. A single orthography has recently been suggested5 which serves for all the dialects of Melanau encountered during my residence in Sarawak, and this is summarised below. All examples from vernacular textual material in the article will appear in this notation, the spelling being appropriate to the phonemic pattern of whichever dialect is involved. There are six vowel letters, i, e, e, a, u, o, seven stops p, t, k, ', b, d, g, six fricatives v, s, z, c, j, h, three liquids r, 1, x, two semivowels w, y, and two nasal letters m, n. In addition there are palatal and velar nasal phonemes, represented by digraphs nfy, ng. Some of the central dialects have a phonemic contrast between voiceless aspiration h and voiced aspiration, which is represented by yh. The northern dialects, which alone require v and z in their inventory, also contrast preglottalised stops b etc., with unitary stops. With the exception of x all these letters have phonic values closely approx- imate to those usually associated with them in European languages; x repre- sents a consonant varying between velar and uvular articulation and varying between vibrant and fricative in mode of articulation. In several of the central dialects it contrasts minimally with r, being fused with r in both northern and southern speech. Vowels are distributed according to the intersection of pararmeters of tongue position and jaw opening; i, e, u are higher, or more close, than C, a, o. For reasons of compatibility with accepted orthographic traditions in the National Language, final u and i after another vowel represent nonvocalic</page><page sequence="4">74 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 15, No. 2 closing off-glides. Should suffixation (or any other device of word formation) shift these glides to a medial position in the affixed word, the more correct w and y appear in the spelling, as e.g. /bau/ up, /bawai/ to ascend. 2. 0. All the Melanau dialects investigated recognise three mutually orthogonal axes along which all directions are aligned. This gives rise to a basic six-term set of spatial deictic reference, which yield a direction and a related location. These terms are oriented with regard to the Main River (referred to hereafter as River, as distinct from Stream, which will always mean a tributary not having River status), and have the effect of restructuring the real world into a rectangular box-like affair. It is not suggested that people actually think of it as rectangular, although it will be shown later that some such constraints on conceptualising may well operate in a manner such as Whorf envisaged; rather, it appears that Melanaus are concerned with the spatial relations of a locality, so that they can talk of a direction as being along or at right-angles to a twisting river in much the same way as a mathe- matician speaks of tangents and normals to a curve at a particular point on that curve. 2.1. Primary orientation, then, is with respect to the River, and is made within the framework of the terms: Direction up /bau/ and Position on /bah bau/ down /iba'/ under /bah iba'/ upriver / aju'/ / aju'/ downriver / aba' / / aba ' / inland / dayeh/ / dayeh/ riverwards / alud/ / alud/ The last directional axis is extended to give a further item: across river /ipah/ /bah ipah/ These terms all occur frequently in recorded material, both singly and compounded, and may be exemplified by: 6 (1) /a makau mesi' da'un kayou bah bau linga nyin/ person walk A+put leaf tree side up ear him Anyone walking puts a leaf on top of his ear. (2) /asou mungu' iba' jigem mengaxut nyin-debei/ dog sit down with A+scratch him-self The dog sat down there and scratched himself. (3) /likou Balah pesalui kuman aju' labi' ga' kapong in/ tribe Upcountry S+canoe from upriver come to village that Dayaks came down by canoe to the village. (4) /a tama nyin agei dayeh juluh dagen guun/ person father her yet inland A+forage in forest Her father was still inland hunting in the woods. (5) /jane' apah ayeng labi' ga' la' ei duin bah ipah aba' kubou/ brother body big come to orchard they-two side across-river down- river house The elder brother came to their orchard which was downriver from</page><page sequence="5">Spatial Deixis in Melanau 75 his house, on the far bank. It will be noted that the four main River terms do not require the preposi- tion of /bah/ when used in construction with a noun, e.g. /kubou/ in (5) above. They are therefore seen to function as directional deictics, rather than locational. The corresponding terms of motion are: ascend /bawai/ descend /ba'ai/ go upriver /kaju' / go downriver /kaba' / go inland /jangai/ approach river /udai, kalud/ cross river /paai/ Two systems of affixation are operating here, and they have partly over- lapped at the term /alud/ in this dialect to produce two motion terms. This duplication has been exploited in Dalat to give the generally understood over- tones of approach the River from a distance to /udai/, and approach the River from close-to to /kalud/. 7 The allomorphs /k-/ and /-ai/ will be discussed in more detail in 3, following. These terms of motion occur very frequently in recorded texts, and their use may be exemplified: (6) /bawai ka'au'/ ascend you-single " Come in.' "8 (7) /lou aju' in pun kaba' ba' suxi kapong in/ those upriver that even go-downriver intend A+attack village that The upriver folk went down to attack the village. (8) /lou Jilag jangai pedaat mapun guun bau/ those Jilag go-inland on-foot approach forest up Jilag and his companions walked inland to the deep jungle. (9) /a debei ta'ou bereneng paai' peba' akit/ person not know swim cross-river S+use raft Those who did not know how to swim got across the river on rafts. Sufficient examples have been given to demonstrate the general working of the system. One or two more will now be cited to support the assertion that primary spatial deixis takes the River as its point of orientation, either overtly or implicitly. /likou/, the Main River whose banks and lower catchment area form the inhabited region of the Melanau area, is a word of wide significance in Melanau. In (3) above, it stood for the tribe named, in that case the Dayaks who live further upcountry; 9 it is also used to denote a village or township, and the people who live there, so that /likou mukah/ can, according to context, mean the Mukah River, Mukah town or the inhabitants of Mukah. In opposition to /sungai/, it means as we have seen the Main River rather than a tributary; in opposition to /guun/ it refers to the inhabited part of the area, rather than to the forests; as against /a sle/ it means a Melanau of the old traditional beliefs, not a Muslim while /a likou/ is the Melanaus' name for themselves.</page><page sequence="6">76 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 15, No. 2 /likou matai/ is the land of the dead, as opposed to /likou tenawan/ the land of the living. Basic to all these notions is /likou/ the Main River, the focus of Melanau life and the subject of the important annual cleansing ceremony, / kaul/ . (10) /lian a kaul, semuah a labi' likou ba' meramai/ time person ceremony, all person come River intend A+get-together At the time for the annual cleansing ceremony everyone comes home to have a party. (11) /nila' nyin ji sungai umit ji, sisud nyin udai mapun aba, ji likou nyin-debei/ P+see him appearance stream small appearance, P+follow him go- riverwards approach mouth, appearance River his-own When he saw a small stream, he followed it down to its mouth and there was his own River (12) /ga' bilit aba' bei kawa' telou ata' kuden ayeng. Besei in unei nina' nyin dagen ata' alud/ at room downriver is also three classifier jar large. Spear-head that back-reference P+put him in classifier riverwards In the room on the downriver side of the house there were in fact three large jars. He put the spear-head (we have spoken of) into the first one he came to. The special feeling for /likou/ is seen in (10) and (II), the place where he himself lived. (11) further demonstrates the use of /udai/ to describe motion in a tributary stream towards the River; this would never be spoken of as /kaba'/ although it is, in other cultures, often thought of as equally down- stream in that it is going with the direction of the current. Paddling into a side-stream is always /jangai/; further branching off that stream, although it brings one back parallel to the original direction of the River, is still /jangai/ without further differentiation. One is getting further away from / likou/. 10 In (12) the use of / aba' / to show the orientation of rooms inside a house is seen clearly. Perhaps more striking is the use of a River-related term for indicating which of the three jars conceals the spear-head; / ata' alud/, the one nearest the River (from which direction he would enter the house) and so 'the first one he came to', This set of motion-terms yields a common fixed order expression, /kaju' kaba'/, literally go-upriver go-downriver, thus (i) come and go on the River, and (ii) aligned with the direction of the River (as a landing pontoon is, rather than the jetty connecting it to the bank). The terms of spatial reference mentioned so far may be diagrammed as:</page><page sequence="7">Spatial Deixis in Melanau 77 River Reference Along River Towards Source Direction: Motion: Direction /aju' / /aba'/ /dayeh/ /alud/ / ipah/ /bau/ /iba'/ Up- Down Inland Towards Across Up Down river river River River /kaju'/ /kaba' / /jangai/ /udai/ /paai/ /bawai/ /ba'ai/ / kalud/ 2. 2o Secondary orientation, once a situation has been localised within the framework so far established, is achieved with a more immediate system. This is anthropomorphic in character as the primary is riverine, and may therefore be called the Personal Reference system. Deictic: ll which / an/ yielding location: where ? / gaan/ this /'ih/ here /gi' ih/ that /in/ there / giin/ remote /inan/ yonder /inan/ face /jawai/ in front /ga' jawai/ side /dawek/ beside /ga' dawek/ back /buta/ behind /ga' buta/ Examples of these terms in use include: (13) / ( ga') gaan kedau tama' ane' 'ih?/ (at) where place father child this? Where does this child' s father live? (14) /debei agei pelikou gi'ih; nga' tabui mapun Sibau inan/ Not still S+home here; past go approach Sibu yonder He does not live here any more; he has already gone to Sibu (which we know to be distant). (15) /ga' jawai Besiong bei ane' raja in, serta tumek nyin in unei ga' dawek nyin/ at face Besiong is child ruler that, and spear-head him that back- reference at side her In front of Besiong there was the ruler' s daughter, with the spear- head (our story is about) in her side. It should be noted that the process of preposition which places /ga'/ before a nominal, e. g. /jawai/, operates on the adjectivals in a slightly dif- ferent way, according to a productive morphological rule of the language. But this means that /gaan/, for instance, already has a built-in /ga' -/, which accounts for the idiosyncratic optional use of an additional /ga' / as a free form; hence the use of brackets. Sentence (15) has a certain ambiguity, in that /ga' dawek nyin/ can equally well mean beside her, in which case /ga' dawek/ is a 'complex prep- osition' (in the sense of Lyons 196812); or in her side as it is translated in this instance, with /dawek nyin/ as a nominal phrase. In the story the ambi-</page><page sequence="8">78 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 15, No. 2 guity is resolved by the broader context, because we know Besiong is looking for a pig which he has speared, and which he suspects of having turned by magic into a human being. The spear, then, will be in its side when he finds it. Very many of the ambiguities of linguistic literature are, of course, resolved in some such way in practice, but the structure of the language is none the less ambiguous at this point in an isolated sentence. Perhaps ambiguous is not the happiest word to use here, for the narrator could have made his meaning clearer in a number of ways; by adding /peliket/ in front of / ga' dawek nyin/, for instance, would have given the additional information that the spear-head was sticking between her ribs, thus locating it in her side rather than at her side, and so on. But he chose not to do this, and left the meaning to be made clear by the context; so that 'unspecific' rather than 'ambiguous' appears in many ways to be a better way of describing this structure in a running text. These terms of personal reference may be extended by metaphorical use to a well-defined locality, so that while the rear room in a house is /bilit dayeh/, behind the house will be /ga' buta kubou/, and /bah buta kubou/ can be either the back side of the house, as it might be a wall; or on the back of the house, as a coat might hang on a nail there. In such cases appeal is made to both systems of deixis to progressively narrow down and specify the place de- noted, as sentence (16) shows. (16) /keliding tekedeng ga' dawek kubou tek aju'/ monument stand-up at-side house end upriver The monument was standing by the upstream end of the house Motion in these directions is formed by prefixing the /k-/ allomorph to the terms of general deixis, according to the productive rule noted already: to where? /kaan/ come here /ki'ih/, /kidei/ go there */kiin/ go yonder / kinan/ in which it is noted that */ kiin/ has not been found in the data recorded; but there seems no good reason why it should not exist as a partner to /ki'ih/. The second term glossed come here occurs most frequently in the fixed order expression /kidei kinan/, closely equivalent to the English 'go hither and thither ' No such affixation is applied to the body-part names to add the dimension of motion in the related direction. To walk forwards would be the unmarked use of /makau/ to walk anyway; but if one wished for some reason of detail to be more specific, some such construction as /jawai si'iu/ face first would be used. (There are instances of this kind of detail in stories involving for instance, climbing trees, where an enemy is confused by being told to climb /bawai pudu', ba'ai pu'u' / upwards buttock, downwards chest, or upside down. 13) In other more usual circumstances a verbal construction is used employing one of the many verbs of motion, as e. g.: (17) /a tina Tugau nigi' luin mapun jawai Raja Yang in/ person mother Tugau P+take them approach face Ruler Yang that</page><page sequence="9">Spatial Deixis in Melanau 79 Tugau' s mother was taken before the King of the Underworld. This secondary referential system could well be diagrammed: Body Reference Definite Proximate Immediate Direction / jawai/ / dawek/ / buta/ /' ih/ / in/ / in'an/ / an/ face side back this that yonder which? 2. 3. At various points this dual system proves inadequate. In the system of riverine reference, as has been shown, the /likou/ is the point of orienta- tion of all deixis on a large scale. This system is carried into the house and the jungle; and it works very well as long as (i) travel is by water, and (ii) the /likou/ in question is clearly defined. Two very typical situations, how- ever, can perturb the system. Hunting trips may take a man so far from his River that no clear orientation by it is possible any longer; and in this low- lying swamp-country one can find oneself in a waterway connecting two Rivers. The Sungai Kut on the map is an example of such a canal in constant use since it was dug through between the headwaters of the Sungai Buni Baya on the Oya and Sungai Makah on the Igan River. The Oya and the Igan are both /likou/. In the first instance, direction is in fact maintained (and referred to in the language) by appeal to the sun as referent. (18) /sisud sisud sisud nyin, menuju mata lau matai/ V+follow V+follow V+follow he, A+point eye day die On and on he followed, going always westwards .... and then, once a tributary stream is encountered, the hunter follows it down to its mouth and in due course re-orientates himself from the new (or perhaps the known) /likou/. The second instance, that of an interconnecting waterway, must be a far more common occurrence in the delta proper, but my exposure to the dialects spoken there is small compared with that in the Dalat area, We shall confine the present enquiry, therefore, to terms used in Dalat speech-community, and find that this has much to contribute to the Whorfian bias of the article. Paddling into the Sungai Kut one is well aware that one /jangai/ travels away from the River. A villager from one of the Igan villages, entering from the other end some six miles distant, is certain that he is doing the same, /jangai/. As long as they confine their movement to the general area of the houses and gardens extending inland a mile or two at either end, there is no confusion; but round about the village of Kut Tengah, halfway through, it is no longer certain which direction is /dlaych/ any more. /jangai/ and /udai/ become meaningless terms. At this point, then, appeal is made to a different system, that of the Coastal Melanaus who go out to sea to fish.</page><page sequence="10">80 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 15, No. 2 In this coastal system, /wab/ and /la'an/ take on the primary role, indicating uyp the coast (in the direction of Brunei, more or less north-east) and down the coast (in the direction of Kuching, approximately south-west). The rectangular layout of the deictic map - if we may so differentiate that which people talk about in the language from what they may well be cognisant of by other means of observation - is now apparent. People using the Kut are said to /padou wab la'an/ travel y boat in a direction parallel to the coast, and by implication at right-angles to the Rivers. The fixed order expression /wab la'an/ is used also to indicate not only direction but also motion, much as /kaju' kaba'/ and /kidei kinan/, without any morphological affixation. The coastal direction system has therefore undergone a considerable modification (begging any implication about which terminology is prior to the other). /dayeh/ and /jangai/ now denote inland from the coastline, and approach the coast from the sea; /alud/ and /udai/ are equivalent to English offshore and go out to sea. /kaju'/ and /kaba'/ retain their riverine axis, for travel in the estuary and upriver to sell fish, and so on. Thus: (19) /ubi lian pull' kuman alud na'ah .../ when time return from offshore later When (they) returned from out-at-sea, (20) /palih luin pesaug udai ba' pila' ji kubou luin megou kah debei/ S+ vigour they S+paddle-vigourously go-shorewards intend S+loo100k appearance house them burning query not ... they paddled towards the shore as hard as they could to see whether their house was truly on fire or not. Returning to the person travelling through the Sungai Kut, we note that if he goes on continuously from one end to the other, at some rather indeterminate point in the middle he has ceased to /jangai/ and begun to /udai/ with refer- ence to another /likou/; all the time, however, he has continued to progress past the same banks in 'the same direction' in an alien (i.e. Western) way of reckoning. This continuity of direction can indeed be expressed implicitly by a different way of speaking about the journey, (21) /lou rayet Jilag kenah pepela mapun likou Igen inan sawa' sungai kikut luin in unei/ those common-people Jilag able S+paddle approach River Igan yonder by-means-of stream P+dig them that back-reference Jilag' s followers could now paddle to the Igan by way of the stream which they had dug. Alternatively it is possible to make some reference to the alignment of the canoe itself, /ga' nyabu/ referring to out in front where appropriate, or at the bows where the story shows this to be the correct interpretation. But direc- tional reference in the primary terminology appears to rule out the possibility of a continuity of primary direction. He must change from /jangai/ to /udai/. In this sense, then, we find support for the claim "we are forced to dissect Nature along the lines laid down by our native language. "14 2. 4. The secondary system of immediately local reference can also be perturbed, but by different factors. A case in point was recorded on the</page><page sequence="11">Spatial Deixis in Melanau 81 occasion of a visit by a government dignitary to a room in which a regatta committee were seated round a table. Until that moment, the group had been unconcerned with the relative status of its members, and they were seated indiscriminately /ga' dawek mija/ around the table. But the presence of a person of eminent status brought a new dimension into the reckoning, by which local deixis must be realigned. Although the spatial layout remained unchanged, there was now a /bah buta/ behind the table, and the official sat there, /mungu' ga' buta mija/, while the others ranged themselves either /ga' jawai mija in/ in front of the table or /ga' dawek/ at either end (side). 3. 0. The further south the investigation was carried, the more prevalent was the /k-/ allomorph over the / -ai/ variant for adding the dimension of motion to a given direction. By the time one reaches Matu in the delta itself, a unitary system is found: Direction (Static) Motion (Dynamic) up / amuh/ / kamuh/ down / iba' / / kiba' / upriver / aju'/ / kaju'/ downriver / aba ' / / kaba' / inland /dayeh/ /kedayeh/, /kalem/ riverwards /awir/ / kawir/ This /k-/ prefix is recognisably similar to the Malay preposition ka towards, and it is noted that the great proportion of the Melanaus in this area have adopted the Islamic religion and associated customs of their Malay pengirans.15 By contrast, the northern group of Melanau dialects also have a unitary system, employing the / -ai/ allomorph. We may take the dialect of Bintulu as typical: Direction Motion up / 'bau/ /' bawai/ down /'bu'/ /'bu'ai/, /mildh/ upriver / aju' / /ju' ai/ downriver / ava' / /va ' ai/16 inland / dayeh/ / jangai/ riverwards / da' ud/ / durai/ In the towns and villages of the coastal rivers in between these extremes various combinations of the two alternatives make up the system in local use, of which synthesis the Dalat dialect presents a typical example. 3. 1. During the summer of 1971 a preliminary survey of customs and lan- guage of a number of inland tribes of the Upper Rejang was undertaken17 with the aim of substantiating or perhaps disposing of persistent traditions that they were related to the Coastal Melanaus. Among the data on specific topics which we were able to record is the now familiar paradigm for direction and motion from the dialect of the Lahanan sub-tribe, the furthest inland in which we pursued our enquiry. Direction Motion up / kebau/ /bagwai/ down / kiva' / / ba'ai/</page><page sequence="12">82 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 15, No. 2 Direction Motion upriver / naju' / /ju' ai/ downriver / nava' / / sa'ou/ inland / nalem/ / lemai/ riverwards / nipa/ /paai/ .... in which it will be seen that /sa'ou/ go downriver lacks the overt /-ai/ marking for motion as /mil6h/ descend did in one Bintulu variant. It is not the purpose to develop here formalised rules of comparison be- tween dialects, but superficial attention may be drawn to several correspond- ences. There is a potential clash between similar terms for motion downwards and down river, which in some dialects results in similar sounding words; in others this clash is avoided by the use of a word outwith the expected pattern, as /sa'ou/ above. The corresponding term in the dialect of Mukah, which for various reasons may well emerge as the dominant Melanau dialect, is /seba'ai/, which bears some phonic relation to the /sa'ou/ of Lahanan and is thereby differentiated from /ba'ai/ to descend. One notes also the shift from v in /kiva'/ to b in /ba'ai/ above; in Bintulu dialect, v is often realised as voiced labial affricate intermediate between English v or b, and tends to occur where other dialects have b(e.g. /vas/ rice, cf. /beras/ in Mukah). Despite the fact that the most obvious similarities are between these inland sub-tribes and the Northern Melanau group, with whom they were found to have family ties and trading links, the correspondence between /lemai/ above and /kalem/ as a variant in the dialect of Matu in the Southern group can not pass unob served. 4. In a study of spatial relations in a language of New Guinea, Cook dwells at length on the vertical differentiation that is built into the terms of Narak deixis.18 koiye differs from pla in that it substitutes at a slant as an additional feature in place of the 'direct' upwardness of pla. Such a differentiation would seem to be highly relevant in a speech-community where, as Cook notes in an illuminating comment, "... the people being referred to will be coming up on top of the ridge, but not straight up since the trail (inclines) up the face of the ridge ..." - thereby reducing the gradient, as every hill-climber knows. Furthermore, all his diagrams show houses built on ridges surrounded by sloping ground, and it is not surprising to find that a vertical dimension is in- cluded in terms of spatial separation in the three expressions ni moron tla, ni moron tma, and ni moron tue, which are shown by helpful diagrams to be under- stood by some such glosses as: you are there on a level with me ) you are there below me ) + other features of you are there above me ) proximity This concern with relevant topographical layout is evidenced in other terms in his collection, such as koma, and kalA for differently featured downward directions, from which it is not possible to isolate any term for the abstract notion of 'down-ness' English-speakers may employ in situations where that notion alone is generally sufficient for our purpose. It is this obligatory inclusion of specific detail highly relevant to the cultural setting, an inability</page><page sequence="13">Spatial Deixis in Melanau 83 within the framework of the language to talk about the generalised concept, that lends weight to the sort of assertion Whorf was making in his well-known essays. The terms actually in use are as closely linked to the situational con.. text of a mountainous habitat as the Melanau direction system is to its River. It would be unrealistic to expect to find in any other language precise equivalents for such esoteric lexical itemls as those quoted for Melanau and Narak - indeed, one might quote the philosopher John Locke "... those of one country, by their customs and nmanner of life, have found occasion to make several complex ideas, and give namnes to them, which others never collected into specific ideas. ,19 Quechua, to take but one further example of a language spoken by a high- land people, 20 does not make the distinctions of vertical displacement found in the Narak terms cited by Cook. A road which is sayaj straight up (the hill), is sasa purina difficult for walking and so one chooses ghata Ban a sloping road. None of these words bears any m-orphological relation to the general term u_, hanan, or down, ura. Taking another language from a totally different situation, Trail of the University of Wittwatersrand assures me that the Bushman languages of the Kalahari desert show remarkable abundance of lexical concern with such things as number, marking a verb such as to take explicitly for one, two or many things taken; yet have but one word for sand and none for rain, two features one might have thought to be as critical to their situation as snow is to those languages investigated by Whorf. 5. The system of spatial deixis is mnarkedly homogeneous throughout the complex of closely related dialects known as Melanau. Similarities with the system in other, inland tribes, while not of themselves conclusive, 21 lend weight to local traditions of a coimion ancestry rather than challenge the assertion. It appears that in a geographical as well as a presumed historical sense, there has been a gradual encroachment into the system by Malay termi- nology, and this is more prevalent in the southern group of dialects, remote from those with closest links with the interior. The primary systemnn of spatial refe lence is closely related to a way of life dominated by the River, in the sanie sort of way as a mountain-dwelling people'r terminology is forced to take explicit account of height and gradient. These observations are in accord with the gceneral tenor of the Whorfian hypothesis rather than against it. There are, e owever, counter-examples which may be drawn from other languages prevenfing one from making too simplistic an interpretation of Whorf' s claims for the connection between the observed world and the language of the observer:C NOT ES 1.

I wish to acknowledge the considerable assistance rendered by the Special Projects staff of the Edinburgh Regional Computing Centre in making available a Concordance programme for the recovery of recurring grammatical partials on the IBM 360/ 50 computer at the Centre. 2. There are many different forms which this hypothesis is supposed to take, generally depending on the standpoint from which a detractor wishes to dispute it. In the most succinct form, "People who speak a different language see a different world" has about it the stark boldness of relativist polemic. K. Percival 1966, Reconsideration of Whorf' s Hypothesis, AL 8: 8. 1-12 assaults an altogether more mild form of it which he quotes from J. Carroll's 1956 collection of Whorf' s writings, Language, Thought and Reality. It is from the same article, Science and Linguistics, that I take the following statement, p. 212 of the MIT edition: "... the background linguistic system of each lan- guage is not merely a reproducing instrument for voicing ideas but rather is itself the shaper of ideas, the program and guide for the individual's mental activity, for his analysis of impressions ... ". This idea, though quoted from Whorf and generally associated with his name and Sapir's, may in fact be traced back through von Humboldt to the principle of untranslatability in John Locke' s Essay Concerning Human Understanding. (H. Aarsleff, The Philosophy of Language from Condillac to Wilhelm von Humboldt, a paper read to the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities, Edinburgh 1972. ) The same notion is clearly implied in such contemporary writing as J. Lyons 1968. 351. 3. Further details about the name Melanau, the customs and traditions of the people and an expedition to their related inland sub-tribes are described in a series of short ethnographical articles in the Sarawak Gazette, a Government journal published monthly in Kuching, from November 1970 onwards. The notes specifically referred to in this article appear in Issues Nos. 1358, 1362, 1369 of 1971-72. 4. Revd B. Mulder and A. E. Lawrence 1930 in Sarawak Museum Journal 4:12. 87-130 is a short vocabulary of Mukah Milano. The spelling is far from phonemic, as is that in R. G. Aikman 1947, A Vocabulary of Matu Melanau, published by the Government Printing Office, Kuching and The Liko Adat, the codification of local custom in daily use in Government offices in the region. Even less reliable is the collection of disparate transcriptions gathered into H. S. Ray 1913, The Languages of Borneo in Sarawak Museum Journal 1: 4. 1-112. Melanau words and phrases occur in H. S. Morris 1954, Report on a Melanau Sago Producing Community in Sarawak and in various other sources noted by A.A. Cense and E.M. Uhlenbeck in their 1958 Critical Survey of Studies on the Languages of Borneo, pp. 17-20, but none of these include any grammatical or analytical work. 5. I. Clayre 1970(a) The Spelling of Melanau in Sarawak Museum Journal 18. 36-7, in which previous work in the language is discussed in greater detail. 6. Material in the vernacular dialects of Melanau is presented between slashes, thus, /likou/. The underlining of vernacular words between the slashes highlights the word or phrase being illustrated. Immediately under a sentence is a word-for-word translation showing some measure of the gram-</page><page sequence="15">Spatial Deixis in Melanau 85 matical structure of the language. Verbs carry, where appropriate, a prefix to the gloss to indicate a morpheme composite in the original containing fea- tures of Focus and Dynamic or Static aspect in the clause; A+, F+ and V+ indicate Agentive, Patient or Verbal Focus in a Dynamic clause, S+ and R+ mark Subject and Patient Focus in a Static clause. This matter is described more fully in I. Clayre 1972(b), Focus and Emphasis in Melanau, Work in Progress No. 6, Department of Linguistics, University of Edinburgh. 7. Synthesis of the two systems of affixation produces a term with redundant morphology in the Igan dialect to the south of Dalat, /kejangai/ to go inland. 8. Melanau houses are typically constructed up on piles above the shallows of a tributary or along the main bank of a river, hence the need to 'ascend' to enter the house. Their riverside orientation gives rise also to the use of terms such as /jangai/ to indicate penetration into the inner rooms, rather than some neutral term such as /maso' / enter. Similarly, /ba'ai/ descend is the word most usually heard for leaving a house in the typical Melanau village, but / keluer/ go outside is heard in reference to the small land-based farm huts which are constructed in the sago gardens remote from the main river. 9. This habit of referring to a tribe further inland by such a name is com- mon among Bornean coastal dwellers, and has the universal connotation of 'country bumpkin' in English. It is widely resented by the tribes-people them- selves, who almost always press for the adoption of some more favourable name of their own usage. But the outside world comes to know of the inland folk largely through contact with the coastal peoples, and thus the derogatory names tend to have established their place in text-books. Increasing deference paid to the well-founded wishes of the indigenous peoples results in a multiplic- ity of names in use for the same people, a situation inviting confusion for ethnographers and administrators alike. 10. An even more interesting use of /jangai/ corresponding to the meta- phorical use of body terms described in 2. 2, is found in an account of a cure effected by the shaman Mang of Kekan: /... anum u'em kou batou in nelu' ui nyin jan ai ... water R+soak I stone that P+swallow him go-inland ... he swallowed down the water in which I had soaked the stones. 11. J. Lyons 1968, Introduction to Theoretical Linguistics, C. U. P. Lyons' discussion of deictic terms on pp. 257 suggests that the Melanau use of /'ih/ to signify both here and now as well as this is far from unusual in the languages of the world. 12. ibid p. 300. 13.

It might be argued that a river-dwelling people could not very reason- ably work by any other sort of deictic system than that which is exemplified here. Sunil Nath, a medical officer working in the Melanau area, tells me that in his dialect of Bengali a somewhat similar set of terms is employed by delta- dwellers, of which the principal axis is juari choli and bhatai choli, which one might gloss towards the inflowing current go = upriver, and towards the natural current go = downriver. Against the assertion that such a system is inevitable (and therefore unin- teresting), one need only make appeal to the huge diversity of natural languages known to the world to see that there is almost no limit to the ways in which the same experience may be verbalised (and therefore, presumably, conceptualised)</page></plain_text>
