Eade's two general divisions of astrology into "natal" and "judi- cial"-the first casting "nativities" for the moment of birth, the second erecting "figures" to answer particular questions-are simply not born out by the nature of extant texts.' Thomas' description of the judi- cial astrologer's four spheres of activity-general predictions, nativi- ties, elections, and horary questions-also presents an unrealistic over-simplification of extant Middle English prognostic documents.2 For the purpose of better understanding the nature of these docu- ments and identifying some major generic forms, this article proposes definitions of the electionary, lunary, destinary, and questionary with a note on their background and a brief survey of representative Middle English works. The extent of astrological prognostic matter written in Middle English during the fourteenth to early sixteenth centuries is now as- IJ. C.

The fact provides an ironic reversal of Wedel's conclusion, based on his 1920 survey, that there were few in- dications "of the presence in medieval England of actual astrologers." 3 Moreover, Thomas' statement that astrological activity in England by the beginning of the sixteenth century was "at a relatively low ebb," and that the "prognostications in circulation during the early sixteenth century were therefore largely of foreign origin" is simply not true.4 Recent work on manuscript collections through the Index of Middle English Prose (1984-) and more extensive publication of a large num- ber of texts and studies indicate that there were indeed many English astrologers throughout the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Moreover, evidence proves that the very large number of astrological texts circulated widely in every class of manuscript-from the most deluxe, illuminated copy on parchment to the poorest household alma- nac on dog-eared paper. Moreover, many texts continued into early printed books. At the same time, assessing this nascent corpus has generated con- fusion about the nature of the genres represented, their scope, and their purpose. For example, the term "destinary" is applied indiscrimi- nately either to collections of prognostics based upon births in certain signs or to collections of prognostics based upon the election of times for certain activities. Or, the term "horary" is applied to any astrologi- cal work which considers the hours when questions (interrogationes) are asked, as Thomas maintains, but may also refer to an electionary work which treats of the "hours" or positions of the heavenly bodies. Contributing to the general confusion in identifying prognostic ma- terial in Middle English has been the common failure of its authors or redactors to identify their works, to rubricate them consistently, or indeed to entitle them at all. While Latin titles such as tractata, liber, speculum, disputatio, questiones, dicta, or ex arte generally assume some implications about form, those in Middle English may not. This is due no doubt to initial uncertainties about what these titles actually meant in Latin, but it may also be the result of confusion arising from inter- mediary Anglo-Norman titles, like livre or mirroir. I have counted over fifty different generic words used to entitle Middle English scientific, 3 Theodore Otto Wedel, The Medieval Attitudes toward Astrology (New Haven: Yale Uni- versity Press), q)o. Wedel based his assumptions almost entirely on "attitudes" reflected in the literature of Rolle, Chaucer, Langland, and Wycliffe. 4 Thomas, 341.</page><page sequence="3">Laurel Means 369 medical, or utilitarian works; most are never used consistently, and many have no reference at all to definition of form or subject matter.5 But the problem is compounded where astrological material is con- cerned for two main reasons. First, there is the central position of astrology in medieval thought, one which may be regarded as inter- disciplinary in the sense that it plays an important role in many other areas, among them medicine, herbology, physiognomia, or theology. This means that often independent astrological matter may be inserted indiscriminately into other works. Henry Daniel's Judgement of Urines, a translation c. 1378 of the De Urinis of Aegidius Corboliensis (Gilles de Corbeil) as glossed by Gilbertus Anglicus, is a case in point, for it contains digressions on both nativities and elections under the pretext that these are part of the same astronomical system which governs uroscopy.6 Secondly, there already exists a close generic relationship between many of the forms of astrological prognostication. This is frequently illustrated by the failure in many manuscripts to distinguish one work from another; often, they are presented consecutively in such a way that no clear division exists between texts. One obvious example is The Book of the Destinary, which forms part of The Wise Book of Astronomy and Philosophy in at least four of its identified manuscripts.7 Another is the verse lunary in BodL MS. Digby 88, ff. 64-75 (IMEV 97o, 1991, 3341), the Epilogue of which might be taken as the Prologue for the "Prognos- tications for Christmas Day" immediately following in the manuscript (ff. 75-76v, IMEV 1905, 1989), and thus printed by Robbins.8 5 E.g., "Arte of," "Boke of," "To the knowinge of," "Complexyoun of," "Craft of," "Disposicioun of," "Ensamplys of," "Experimentes of," "Donet of," "Introductory of," "Judiciale of," "Mirror of," "Nota," "Sayings of," "Syens of," "Tretys of," "Secres of," or "Wordes of," with many variants of each. 61 am grateful to Dr. L. M. Eldredge of Oxford, England, for pointing out that Daniel's source is Gilles de Corbeil, not Isaac judaeus as previously assumed. See ed. L. Choulant, Aegidii Corboliensis Carmina Medica (Leipzig, 1826), 3-18. Not all 22 identi- fied manuscripts of Henry Daniel's work (as listed by Thomas Kaeppeli, O.P., Scriptores Ordinis Praedicatorum Medii Aevi [Rome: S. Sabina, 19751, I1:193) contain these two di- gressions. See, however, BodL MSS. e Musaeo 187, ff. 7-7v, 30-32v; and Ashmole 1404, ff. 88v-95v.

Ashmole 189 (pt. 2), ff. 84v-85. This text is a com- bined zodiacal and mansion lunary and purely prognostic, but might well be seen through its title as a series of "experiments" (Lat. experi- mentum, 'test based on observation') or demonstrations of the moon's influence (similar to Peter of Abano's notion in his Liber Experimento- rum ... Secundum 28 Mansiones Lunae).9 Lunesons refers to lunation, the monthly lunar cycle. It would seem useful, therefore, to attempt to establish some basic, generic guidelines for these works. Such guidelines might serve, first, to define the broader categories, then to aid in the identification of individual texts. Finally, they might help to distinguish closely related forms within a single category. (1) ELECTIONARY The electionary may be defined as follows: "a guide for choosing (i.e., 'electing') activities according to the most favorable astrological conditions." It must first describe the nature of such conditions as part of its purpose. In doing so, the electionary represents the most impor- tant of all prognostic texts, since it establishes the astrological basis upon which all judicial astrology depends: the qualities of the heav- enly bodies and their influences upon each other and the microcosm, both by nature (qualitates essentiales) and through accidents (qualitates accidentales) caused by different heavenly positions. The beginnings of the electionary, of course, are found in Ptolemy's (Claudius Ptolemeus, 100-178) Tetrabiblos, that starting point for most Arabic and Western judicial astrology: If, then, a man knows accurately the movements of all the stars, the sun, and the moon, so that neither the place nor the time of any of their configurations escapes his notice, and if he has distinguished in general their natures as the result of previous continued study, . . . what is to prevent him from being able (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1955), 63-64. IMEV: Carleton Brown and Rossell Hope Rob- bins, The Index c)f Middle English Verse (New York: Columbia University Press, 1943). 9 The word experimenta is also used in a medical sense; see especially Michael McVaugh, "The Experimenta of Arnald of Villanova," /MRS 1 (1971): 107-18, an edition of 73 experimenta describing medical problems and methods of treatment based upon observation and experience.</page><page sequence="5">Laurel Means 371 to tell on each given occasion the characteristics of the air [or] ... the general quality of [man's] temperament? '0 An alternate name for the electionary might be the horary, based upon the notion of the election of hours or of "times" (temporum) in different conditions, especially during the reigns and dignities of planets and signs, a period when they exert their strongest influence. "Elections of (or according to) hours" (de electionibus in horis) is often a variant rubric, whether for Latin or Middle English texts. Based ultimately on Ptolemy, there are many Arabic and Latin proto- types of the electionary. Zael's (Zahel Benbriz, c. 822-50) Liber Elec- tionum, Dorotheus of Sidon's De Electionibus in Horis, and the pseudo- Ptolemaic work of the same name circulated in many redactions." Messahalla's (Masha 'allah, c. 750-c. 815) De Significatione Planetarum, translated by John of Spain (Johannes Hispalensis, fl. 1135-70), and his De Septem Planetis both consider elections.'2 Albumasar's (Abu Ma'shar Ja'far, 787-886) Introductorius, De Magnis Coniunctionibus et Annorum Reuolutionibus, and the Flores Astrologiae were also translated by John of Spain; a compilation entitled Electiones Planetarum discusses elections by lunar aspects.'3 Haly Abenrudwan's ('Ali ibn Rudhwan) De Elec- tionibus was translated by John of Spain.'4 John also translated works on elections by Haly Embrani ('Ali 'Imrani, c. 955), as well as a similar work by Haly Abenregal ('Ali ibn Abi r'-Rijal, + c. 1040).'5 Alchabitius' ('Al-qab'si, + c. 967) Liber Introductorius is largely based on Ptolemy, but his Liber Isagogus ad Scientiam ludicalem Astronomiae includes a more elaborate electionary.'6 Roger of Hereford's (fl. 1170-90) Liber de Cogi- 10 Claudius Ptolemeus, Tetrabiblos, ed. and trans.

Zael's Introductorium, based upon works by Ptolemy (Tetrabiblos), Dorotheus, Hermes, and Messahalla, considers elections within his general discussion of the nature of the twelve signs, their gender, and the hours and homes of the planets.'8 The very popular Liber Astronomicus of Guido Bonatti (c. 1277) is a compendium derived from Ptolemy, Hermes, Dorotheus, Albumasar, Messahala, Albohali, Alchabitius, and others; it contains 146 consider- ations affecting astrological judgments, most based upon elections.'9 Richard of Wallingford's Exafrenon (c. 1320) derives mainly from Albu- masar's Flores through John of Seville's translation, and begins by con- sidering the lord of the year, and, commencing with Saturn, outlines the qualities and dignities of the planets and signs and the changes brought about by the accidents of aspect. As the text in its Middle English translation concludes, when thu knawis the lord of the yere, or of the moneth, and the vertuis of the planetis in thare stedys and in the howsis, and thu wilt proficye of wedeirs and of the plentie of fructe, take hede to the aspectis and the begynnyngis of thame, and thu salt resonably knawe what is for to doo or to come.20 Somewhat similar in scope is John of Eschenden's Summa iudicialis de accidentibus minndi (completed 1347-48), which discusses in two books with twelve distinctions each the revolutions and conjunctions as they determine the universal accidents of the world (e.g., storms, floods, famines, pestilences, and especially in Book II, weather predictions). The elections which such conditions determine are elaborately de- ceived an important commentary by John of Saxony, c. 1480.

Again, a wide variety of electionary material provides Eschenden's sources: Ptolemy, Firmi- cus Maternus, Haly Abenregal, Albumazar, Zael, Hermes Trismegis- tus, Robert Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, Vincent of Beauvais, and many others.21 Finally, an electionary could be as specialized as John of Seville's later redaction/translation of Haly Embrani's De Electionibus Horarum. In at least two manuscript versions the work concerns only elections favorable to phlebotomy.22 Those texts which I would identify as Middle English prognostic versions of the electionary reflect this long and diverse Arabic and Latin tradition. The most important sources appear to be Ptolemy (in- directly), Haly Abenregal, Messahalla, Albumasar, and Alchabitius. The introductory (Book I) to the electionary proper (Book II) in BodL MS. Ashmole 337 and variant manuscripts best describes its theoreti- cal basis: For as moche as euery sciens or craft is an art for his vtilite.

But pryncipally in prognostications and eleccions of tymes, ther- for in this tretys I wol determyn of eleccions of tymes principally the whiche elections be necessary to know in Oe begynnyng of all workyngy.23 Book I then proceeds to describe the nature of the planets-beginning with Saturn-and signs as the basis for those conditions upon which elections are to be based.24 Book II, entitled De Electionibus Temporum, begins with a definition of "elections": 21 On John of Eschenden and his manuscript tradition, see Thorndike, 111:325-46, 717-20. 22 On this text, see Carmody, 139. 23 BodL MS.

(f. lo) Acknowledging Ptolemy (f. 1i) and Haly Abenregal (f. liv) as sources, Book II continues with those precise components of elections: which signs are moveable; which fixed; which mixed; the nine impediments of the moon; the influences of the seven planets in their hours; and finally the conjunctions of the moon with Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, and Mercury. These elements provide the conditions and times of astrological influence which must be taken into account, either when "electing" times for action or when predicting the outcomes of those actions. Thus, when the moon is in conjunction with Mercury, thann wele comonly the deys be wuyndy. And than is good to begynn to lerne sciences. And to sett chy}dern to the scole. And to wette letteres.

Ashmole 393 (pt. 5), pp. 45-115, is identified as such in the explicit ("here endith the eleccion"), and appears to be a compendium of Alchabitius and Haly Abenregal (e.g., "Haly Abenragell makyth wryttynge vppon this in the 8 chapitre of his Dome Judiciall," p. 116). It is less a theoretical work than a prac- tical handbook on how to project elections, and in fact provides blank, twelve-part mundane house figures (see explanation below) to be used as the basis for calculations but only through the seventh house (p. 82); blank spaces occur thereafter. It describes such components as dignities and aspects which are "the most necessare consideracouns introductorous to euery partie of the juggementis of asteronomye" and establishes, after Alchabitius, the essential and accidental dignities of the planets as the first necessary consideration in making all elections (p. 45). The work concludes with an account of elections in the twelve houses, followed by a colophon in which the scribe identifies himself as "h ff" (later glossed "Humffery Felingtone") and provides the date "1505" (p. 116; see also n.23 below).

In the text contained in BodL MS. Ashmole 396, ff. 74-88v (ends imperfectly), the author establishes that "elections" can only be established at the beginning of a configu- ration of planets and signs, corresponding only to the time when a house is being built (f. 74v). He then proceeds to outline the properties of the signs and planets and their aspects within the twelve houses and the areas of life which they govern (e.g., the first house for life, the second for money and possessions, and so on). In the same manuscript (ff. 92-125v) appears the only known Middle English translation of the Abbreviatio of John Eschenden's Summa Iudi- cialis de accidentibus Mundi, entitled The Introductory of Asschenden. Be- ginning with the incipit, "After that it is determyned before of vniuer- sall and generall rules that dyuers astronomers have sette in thaire bokes of thynges that happen in this world by the myght and strength of the bodies above," the work first establishes the qualities and natures of the planets and signs through which accidents are deter- mined. It then considers election procedures from the natural ascen- dant to citing positions from the fixed stars. An electionary may also focus upon a single astrological predic- tor, such as the hours of the planets (i.e., planetary reign). This is the case for the Middle English text "De Electionibus in Horis Plane- tarum" in BL MS. Sloane 636, ff. 104-104v, which begins "In the oure of [Jupiter glyphi hit is goode to pursue youre enmys"; its elections follow through the other planets (including the moon), with the final caveat that the best elections of hours must occur when a planet is in its dignity, i.e., the sign which it rules by nature of its first ascendancy and which augments its positive qualities.25 It is questionable whether the short text in BodL MS. Ashmole 340 (pt. 1), ff. 17v-18v, and other related texts really constitute electionaries, for they are based upon versions of the De Mutatione Aeris and consider only aspects between the planets and how these predict weather and the quantity of crops; such texts relate to a large body of material with similar prognostics usually designated "The Prophecies of Esdras" or "Erra Pater." 26 25 An electionary also based upon hours, Sun-Mars, is found in BodL 396, ff. 198-99: Inc.: "The Houre of the Sonne. Beware what werke thou begynne for she is infortunat." 26 These include two main divisions based upon which day of the week Christmas or New Year's Day falls; both divisions include verse and prose.

The name, from Latin luna, 'moon,' developed to lunaria, 'use of the moon,' appears to be appropriate, but in fact the term is mod- ern and not used in medieval texts themselves, in which 'lunary' (Lat. lunaria, Middle English lunaryllunarie) is rarely used in a prognostic sense, but rather to indicate technical data regarding the moon's age.27 The so-called 'lunary,' or lunar prognostic texts, are closely related to the electionary in that they focus upon planetary influence and "elect" or determine the best times for particular events according to how these events relate to the twelve houses: birth, sickness, friendship, travel, and so on. But the lunary selects only one planet, the moon, to determine such prognostics, and its influence is measured primarily by its age or position in its cycle. The moon's influence upon the microcosm is more visible than that of any other planet. As Ptolemy in the Tetrabiblos (and the Centiloquium attributed to him) first stressed its importance as that planet closest to the earth, it became in judicial astrology the one whose effects are more immediately apparent, especially with regard to meteorology and physiognomia.28 The notion became commonplace through Ptolemy's ff. 12v-13V; Harley 2252, f. 154; Sloane 297, f. 112; Sloane 635, ff. 9v-lov; Sloane 393, f. 73v; BodL Digby 88, ff. 25-26, f. 77; CCC 457/395, ff. 74-75; CUL Ee.1.15, f. 73; York Minster XVI.E.32, ff. 118-19; Huntington HM 1336, f. 53; and Princeton, Garrett 141, ff. 78-78v, 87-87v. Verse versions of the "New Year's" text are listed IMEV 73, 1194, 3265, 4253; among prose versions are BL Harley 671, ff. 15-15v; Sloane 340, ff. 74-75v; BodL Ashmole 189 (pt. 2), ff. 102v-103V; Ashmole 393 (pt. 4), ff. 36-37v; CCC 457/395, ff. 52-53; and Warminster, Longleat 174, ff. 81-8iv. There are also a number of variants. These include "First of January" (B3L Sloane 213, f. iii; Sloane 393, f. 73v; BodL Ashmole 393 [pt. 4], ff. 37-37v); "Kalends of January" (BL Harley 671, f. 25; Sloane 213, f. 11o; Sloane 340, f. 74; BoddL Ashmole 189 [pt. 2], f. 102; Ashmole 393 [pt. 2], ff. 36-37; Digby 88, ff. 25-26; and Huntington HM 1336, f. 35). More distant forms are based upon other determinants, such as St. Paul's Day, day of changes of the moon, the Sunday letters, and thunder in signs. 27 See my forthcoming article, "The Word Lunary in Middle English Usage," which demonstrates that the word was seldom applied to Middle English texts but rather to volvelles or lunar tables. 28 "As the moon, too, as the heavenly body nearest the earth, bestowes her effluence most abundantly upon mundane things, for most of them, animate or inanimate, are sympathetic to her and change in company with her." Ptolemy, Tetralbiblos, 1.2, pp. 7- 13. Middle English paraphrases of this notion occur in various lunary introductions, e.g., BodL MS. Selden Supra 9o, f. 16v; and Ashmole 210, pt. 5, f. 8i. Yet it was so commonplace as to be used by Daniel in his Judgement of Urines (see, e.g., BL MS. Royal 17.D.i, f. 46).</page><page sequence="11">Laurel Means 377 adapters, such as Haly Albohazen (De Judicia Astrorum); Messahala (De Testimoniis Luni, Liber Iudiciorum); Albumasar (De Revolutionibus Annorum, and Institutorium Astronomiae); and Haly Abenrudwan (De Proprietatibus Lune. 29 The notion is also expressed at the beginning of a number of Middle English lunaries in order to lay the theoretical groundwork for their prognostications.30 Most likely the electionary provided the main source for the lunary. Many electionaries devote much description to the moon's nature and aspects. Dorotheus (especially in his In Luna),31 Messahalla, Haly Abenregal, and their adapters establish the moon's ascendancy in a moveable sign as the first and most important election, and the im- pediments of the moon (whether in an evil or favorable house, and so on) relevant to determining all other elections.32 Haly Embrani's De Electionibus Horarum (itself a compilation of Alkindus [Al-Kindi, + 8501, Ptolemy, Messahalla, and others), contains an account of the lunar mansions.33 Albumasar's De Revolutionibus considers the effects of the moon in aspect with each of the planets, beginning with Saturn, and its effect upon all areas of life.34 Moreover, when an electionary such as the Latin version entitled Liber Amitegni in BodL MS. Laud Misc. 594, ff. 142-53, considers elections in 28 chapters according to cate- gories of activities-birth, health, and so on-it demonstrates another kind of similarity of application with the lunary, that of topical appli- 29 For the textual traditions of these works, see Carmody, 31-33, 37, 156.

Such theories find their way into other works, for ex- ample Robertus Anglicus' Commentary of the Sphaera of John Sacro- bosco (c. 1271): there he outlines the effect the moon has upon mobile, fixed, or mixed signs in all areas covered by the lunary, including the anachronistic return of fugitive slaves. He cites Zael's De Electionibus as one of his sources.35 The last portion of the Middle English "Elec- tion of Times," described above from BodL MS. Ashmole 337 and other manuscripts, deals with the different properties of the moon as it moves through the signs, Aries-Pisces, and its influence upon all areas of life, including birth, friendship, profession, and so on (see especially ff. 15-19). The Middle English electionary in BodL MS. Ash- mole 393, also mentioned above, could even more readily be mistaken for a lunary in its range of prognostics but for the fact that these are organized according to the twelve houses, rather than the moon's course. The lunary is by far the most popular and widely circulated prognos- tic genre of the Middle Ages.?6 It is represented by two basic formats. The first, and probably the proto-type, depends upon the "day" or "mansion" (Arabic manzil, Latin mansio) of the moon, that is, upon the position of the moon within its ecliptic around the earth in the lunar month proper of 28.5 days. The significance of each mansion for spe- cial influence as a result of particular aspects is well recognized in early works such as the treatises of Alfarghanus (al-Farghani, + 863) and Hermes, in which each mansion is named, beginning with "Alnath" in Aries, and its attributes described.37 The second depends upon the 35 Robertus Anglicus, Commnentary, ed. Thorndike, "Sphere" of Sacrobosco, 221-23. 36 On the nature and context of the lunary, see my articles "Popular Lunar Astrology in the Late Middle Ages," Univzersity of Ottawa Quarterly 48 (1978): 187-94; "Scientific and Utilitarian Prose," in Middle English Prose: A Critical Survey of Major Authors and Genres, gen. ed.

For each "day" or "month" the lunary provides prognostications or predictions about the outcome of certain events occurring to these times. The lunary may be of a general nature, referring to a large number of areas like birth, death, travel, planting, business, marriage, phlebotomy, or illness; or it may specialize in a limited number, the most popular being illness and phlebotomy. Computational calcula- tions are an important measure of the lunary's accuracy, which ac- counts for references within the texts to consulting calendars or tables giving the age of the moon and the frequent occurrence of these and related documents in lunary manuscripts. Representative forms of the day- or mansion-type lunary begin with reference to "the first day of the moon," continuing to the 28th or 30th day, e.g., "The first day is gode to do what thyng that gode is. And he that is born in that day, he schall be trew and nobely lettered, and he schal be in peryll of water" (BL MS. Sloane 989, ff. 55v-71v).3 But perhaps more popular than this, the simplest of the types, is one combined with biblical reference for each of the days, e.g., "Pe fyrst day of Pe mone / God weste wel wat was to done; / Adam pat day he made." (BodL Douce 84, ff. 46-53).39 Because the mansion- or day-type is more precisely calculated than the sign-lunary, it is more suitable for medical practice, especially with regard to phlebotomy. Among the simplest of phlebotomy lunaries is the one-folio version contained in BodL MS. Ashmole 346, which begins "Luna la all Pe day to let blode it is god but namely to fore vndern" (f. 16v).40 The phlebotomy 38 For other manuscripts of this type see, e.g., BL MSS.

A somewhat similar redaction (lMEV 970, 1991, 3341) is edited as L2 in Destinies from ii manuscripts and two early printed edi- tions. Other biblical 'day' lunaries in prose or verse include BL MSS.

Representative forms of the month- or sign-lunary normally begin with the moon ascendant in the first sign, Aries, and end with Pisces. It may begin with prognostics for the nativity of one born in that sign (thus similar to the destinary), as in MS. TTC R.14.51, ff. 20- 22 (inc.: "Here begynnyth also Pe mone and declareth what tyme a body ys bore what hym schall befall"). But topics may continue be- yond nativity. Usually an association is made between a sign and those parts of the body it governs, thus determining the nature of many of the prognostics. A typical example is "Whanne Pe mone is in ariete, pat is, Pe signe of a ram, Pe whiche signe regneo in Pe hed of man and woman" (BodL MS. Selden Supra go, ff. 16V-21V).4' The Sothe- fast Connyng of Astrology represents the most important text of this type, making connection between month and sign by providing both in prominent rubrics, e.g., Aries/March.42 This type of lunary lends see Braswell-Means, "Moon and Medicine."

Taavitsainen, Middle English Lunaries, 82-83, provides a manuscript list</page><page sequence="15">Laurel Means 381 itself well to certain types of prognostication such as traveling, im- prisonment, or friendship, because of the general association between the signs and certain properties or conditions. Gemini, for example, is seen anthropomorphically as twins or bi-corporeal and therefore conducive to friendship, while Pisces, visualized as fish, character- ized as a watery sign and governing the feet, is propitious for travel- especially by water.43 Similarly, the sign-lunary can make more obvi- ous connections than the day-type between the moon, sign, planet, month, and geographical location in meteorological prognostics, given the theoretical domination by planets and signs of the four zones of the earth. As well as being a topic included in most sign-lunaries, weather provides the central set of prognostics in some meteorological lunaries. Because the topic is commonplace among astrological/astro- nomical treatises, e.g., the Liber de pluviis et ventis contained in BodL Digby 194, f. 147V (inc.: "Sapientes ventis et pluviis indicant secun- dam lunam"), which considers the effect of the moon upon weather in each of its mansions or days, precise sources would be difficult to determine. The Middle English text in BodL Ashmole 189 (pt. 2), ff. loo-ioov, has as its actual astrological basis the moon in triplicities of signs." Whether based upon days, signs, or triplicities, this type of lunary should not be confused with other weather prognostics, which of other related types, but, because she does not hold the "zodiacal moon books" to be "lunaries proper," omits them from her discussion. Since it would appear that the medieval users of lunar prognostications did not make such a distinction-the moon maintained the same influences however its position might be calculated, whether from the accidents generated by day, planet, or sign, I feel both forms are so closely related generically as to form one body of astrological material and so include them both under this lunary category. 43 An example of a friendship or company lunary arranged by signs is found in BodL MS. Ashmole 189 (pt. 1), f. 68-68v (my Lg, in Destinies). Representative travel lunaries are BL MSS. Sloane 636, f. 103 (my Lio); Sloane 965, ff. 6v-7v, with a variant in BodL MSS. Ashmole 189 (pt. i), f. 67v, the latter including a Latin charm (my Lli); Ash- mole 210 (pt. 2), f. 21X (my L12); and Ashmole 393 (pt. 4), ff. 40v-41. A travel lunary rubricated The Moon of Ptoleme, edited as my L13, is found in BodL MSS. Ashmole 349, ff. 2-2v; Ashmole 1405, pp. 147-48 (16th-cent. copy); BL MSS.

Imprisonment and prognostications on length of time and release is the single subject of BodL MS. Ashmole 210 (pt. 2), f. 21X (my L14). 44 The lunar prognostics in this case are probably extracted from one of many trea- tises entitled De Triplicitis. There are many Middle English versions of and notes on this topic, which explain why the moon is particularly affected by three planets having similar qualities, e.g., BodL MSS. Ashmole 210 (pt. 2), f. 29V; Ashmole 210 (pt. 5), f. 91; Ashmole 396, f. 91v; Selden Supra 73, f. 28; CCC 725/336, f. 125v; and TTC R.14.52, f. 145.</page><page sequence="16">382 Middle English Prognostic Material include the Middle English "Impressions Concerning the Weathering," based upon De Mutationibus Aeris,45 and those many texts prognosti- cating upon events of the year depending upon which day of the week Christmas, New Year's Day, St. Paul's Day, or the kalends of January might fall, or the occurrence of thunder in diverse times of the year or any of the twelve signs. These do not depend exclusively upon the course of the moon or indeed upon astrological conditions; rather they depend upon factors such as the day of the year, the Sunday Letter, or natural phenomenon.46 Like the day- or mansion-type, the sign- or month-type may focus on medical and phlebotomy prognostics, an obvious connection due to melothesia and the governance by signs of parts of the body. Prob- ably the most important of these is The Boke of Ypocras, now found to be extant in at least seven manuscripts, which "teaches by planet sick- ness, life, and death," and urges the leech to "take heed of the moon," beginning with Aries.47 Another text, which focuses upon medical matters, while not excluding the other normal categories, begins: It profitip ful greetly to euery surgyn to knowen and to witen in what signe and in what degree of Pe signe 1e sunne and Pe mone sitti4 euery daye in ony of je xij signes. The text then points out similar benefits to "physicians" and "barbers" for the administration of medicine, surgery, and phlebotomy.48 But here we enter an area in which it becomes even more diffi- cult to categorize the lunary and to determine where precise bound- 45 E.g., BodL 591, ff. 40-42v, inc: "First it is to knowe that Pe eyere is devided into iij partys"; BL Sloane 6, ff. 3-9V, inc.: "Pe chaungyng of Pe aer is done in 4 maner, of Pe tymes of Pe yere." 46 Versions of these texts, especially the "Esdras" type, are too numerous to list here; see, e.g., IMEP 1:6116], 37(51, 37-38161; IMEP 111:30[2], 31-32[6]; IMEV 1423.

There are some medical and phlebotomy texts which de- pend upon lunar prognostics, but which have never been defined as lunaries, properly speaking. Middle English versions of the pseudo- Hippocrates' Libellus de Medicorum Astrologia, as translated by Peter of Abano (+ c. 1316), and various dietaries resemble the sign-lunary in the sense that they follow the moon's cycle through the signs. In the case of the Libellus, prognosis is for various ailments and recom- mendations for phlebotomy and surgery, beginning with the moon ascendant in Aries.49 In the case of the dietary, instructions are given for diet and phlebotomy according to the sign or month.50 But there are many "critical" or "perilous day" texts which may re- semble both the Libellus and dietary types, e.g., BodL MS. Ashmole 342, ff. 131v-33, which lists critical days, beginning with January, and is immediately followed by a Latin text of "Aristotle's Letter to Alex- ander" (from the Secreta Secretorum), and then a text of the "Three Perilous Mondays" (i.e., "moon-days," the day on which the moon reigns by virtue of being first to rise in the ascendant, f. 136). The fact that such texts are usually found in clusters, often containing minor variants of the same version, makes their textual history and generic definition more complex. The series contained in Aberdeen Univer- sity MS. 123, ff. 154-54v, is a good case in point. It begins with three "perilous days" for phlebotomy-the first Mondays of January and June, the second Monday of October-then lists the first Monday of February, the last Monday of May, and the last Monday of September 49 Middle English versions of Peter of Abano's Libellus include BL MSS.

Agronomy is an important topic in the lunary, whether based upon days or months, since the age of the moon and its aspects is affected by the seasons and in turn produces meteorological change related to agricultural growth. Nicholas Bollard's Book of Planting and Grafting purports to instruct "wiche tymes of Pe 3ere is best to graffe or to plante treis," but begins with the moon in Cancer, continues to Aries/March, and provides more precise instructions based upon the more propitious five to nine days before the full moon and the 21St to 25th day of the fourth quarter.53 Many hybrid forms of the lunary evolved in Middle English, another contributor to difficulties in identification. For example, BodL Ash- mole 342 (pt. 5), ff. 126V-29v, and Ashmole 396, ff. 193-97v, are both day-lunaries beginning with the moon in the first mansion, but both provide zodiacal figures in degrees and minutes for each mansion (dropped in MS. Ashmole 342, when a new hand begins in the middle of Day 21 on f. 130); moreover, MS. Ashmole 342 introduces prog- 51 Another type of conflation problem is illustrated by the "critical Mondays" text forming the last part of The Book of Destiny in Cambridge, Magdalene College MS. Pepys 878, pp. 34-36; a similar text is combined with a phlebotomy text in Huntington MS. HM 64, f. 81v (IMEP I:6[i8]). 52 Although John Hirsh, "Why Does the Miller's Tale Take Place on Monday?" ELN i3 (1975): 86-go, looks at the traditions of "Egyptian Days" as represented by the Middle English text contained in BodL MS. Ashmole 59, ff. 135V-36, much remains to be done on what I see as seven main categories of such texts. These are "Fifty Canicular (or "Dog") Days" (e.g., BL MS. Egerton 2572, f. 56v; BodL MS. Ashmole 148i, f. 25; CCC MS. 457/395, ff. 45-45v); "Thirty-one Days" (e.g., CCC MS. 457/395, ff. 51-51V); "Thirty- Two Days" (e.g., BL Additional 5407, ff. 69-72); "Thirty-Three Days" (e.g., BodL MS. Ashmole 1481 (pt. 2), ff. 25-25v); "Three Days" (e.g., BL MS. Egerton 848, ff. 3-3v); "Mondays" (e.g., BodL MS. Ashmole 59, f. 133); and "Fridays" (e.g., BodL MS. Douce 6o, f. 228). Attribution may be to "Bede" or "St. John"; the texts are often conflated. 53 Ed. W. L.

While The Experimentys of the Lunesons, mentioned above, presents "the first mone" and so on to an (incomplete) total of eight, it refers to "the woman born in pat moneth" on f. 84v, and thus suggests its real basis in a sign lunary. Further difficulty in identifying and subsequently categorizing the lunary is due to the fact that extant titles often bear no relation to contents. Rubric range is very broad and can be misleading. Whereas The Thyrtty days of the Mone found in the biblical verse lunary of MS. Sloane 1315, f. 49, and the prose lunary of MS.

R.3.20 (368), running title pp. 237-57, are misleading and suggest no connection with the lunary at all: in fact, the latter relates the text to various dietaries (e.g., the Dyetarie attributed to Emperor Sigismond in BodL MS. Digby 67, ff. 23-31V, itself containing a section very similar to a day-type lunary).54 Other titles may include variations of Storia lune, Nota, Ensamplys, The Experimentys, The Tyme, The Moone of Tolome, The Sothefast Connyng of Astrology, The Disposicions, or The Boke of Destenys, the last actually derived from the destinary proper."5 Again, generic distinctions can be blurred through the misappli- cation of titles within texts. What is entitled "Elecionis of signis mouabyll" in MS. Ashmole 393 (pt. 4), ff. 40v-41, for example, and appears at first glance to be an electionary, is in fact a travel lunary based upon signs (inc.: "When luna ys yn Aries then hit is gode to go estward by lond or by watre or by see," see n. 43 above). Prog- nostics also cover counsel, business, and health, and may constitute an abbreviated form of such sign-lunaries as MS. Selden Supra go, ff. 16v-21v. John Metham (1449) designates his prose lunary, based on lunar mansions, as both "destinary" and "Off days namyd cretyk"- the latter referring to "critical days" (11. 1-2, 292). 54 Cf. f. 30v: "Now a generall rule of all dayes in the moone thorowgh all the monethys in the yere. Which ben goode. And whiche be evyll to blede vppon. The fyrst day of the mone is goode all day." 55 For additional variant titles, see Taavitsainen, Middle English Lunaries, 19, and my Destinies, Introduction.</page><page sequence="20">386 Middle English Prognostic Material (3) DESTINARY The destiniary may be defined as follows: "a horoscope; a group of prognostications based upon time of birth, determining destiny (Latin destinaria, 'fate' or 'fortune'). This is decided by the position of the sun or moon at the time of nativity (usually determined by whether the birth is diurnal or nocturnal)." In defining differences between the electionary and the destinary, it is useful to recall Hugh of St. Victor's (c. 1130) distinction between various classifications of the mathemati- cal (as opposed to the mantike) magical arts. Aruspices, 'soothsayers,' are horuspices or horarum inspectores, 'inspectors of hours or times,' i.e., elections; horoscopia, on the other hand, are performed by genethliaci, and determine the fates or destinies of men from the position of the stars at the time of birth.5 Notwithstanding the distinctive nature of the destinary in theory, in practice the rubrics for Middle English destinaries may include the words "destiny," "destinary," "destina- tions," "predestinactions," "hours," "horoscope," "nativities," or "for- tune." The word fortune is used synonymously with destiny, even though technically pars fortunae has a special significance for judicial astrology.57 At least three of these five concepts are reflected in the 56 Hugh of St. Victor, Didascalicon, trans. Jerome Taylor (New York: Columbia Univer- sity Press, 1961), VIxv, Appen. B, 155. 57It is important to distinguish "fortune," in the general sense of "destiny," and "fortune" from the more technical notion of pars fortunae. Pars fortunae from Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos onwards (IIl.lo, pp. 275-82) provided a technical means of determining more precisely the quality of life, degree of wealth, and state of happiness. Firmicus Mater- nus, Matheseos libri ViII, ed. W. Kroll and F. Skutsch (Leipzig: B. G. Teubner, 1968), IV. 16, pp. 237-39, calculates locus fortunae from the sun (in the case of diurnal geniture) by adding the longitude of the sun to that of the moon, then dividing by 30? for each intervening sign and placing fortuna in whatever degree remains; the same method is used, beginning from the moon, in the case of nocturnal geniture. Among later Arabic astrologers like Albumasar, fortuna became one of the twelve so-called "Arabic parts," the normal calculation being to add the longitude of the moon at birth to the longitude of the ascendant sign, then subtracting the longitude of the sun and placing pars fortu- nae in the resulting degree. On comparative methods, see Bouche-Leclercq, L'Astrologie grecque (Paris: E. Leroux, 1899), 289-96. While some Middle English destinaries simply use the word in the first sense, some may depend upon more complex definitions and upon a wide variety of methods. "Fortune" can be assigned to different signs with different effects, e.g., in the treatise on "judgments" signed (by the scribe?) "Thomas Scalon" in BodL MS. Ashmole 391 (pt. i), f. 6. A Middle English table shows degrees of "fortune" or "elrenyng" within the 12 signs in BodL MS. 340 (pt. 1), f. 15v, and these degrees are given their Latin names in the destinary contained in CCC MS. 336/725, f. 43. To 'fortune a planet' means to consult the position of a planet within the degrees of fortune in the electionary in BodL MS. Ashmole 393 (pt. 5). In the case of interro- gations, "Fortune" is represented by two special geomantic figures (see below). Finally, "fortune" might simply be assigned in a fixed way to the seventh domus essentials (as, e.g., in the figure in BodL MS. Ashmole 340 (pt. 1), f. 2oV).</page><page sequence="21">L,aurel Means 387 rubric of the Middle English destinary in BodL MS. Ashmole 343, which begins, "Here begynneth the boke of fortune of the berthe of man or woman vp on the cowrs of the sunne be ke xij sygnes as astronomye tellys" (f. 2). More selective is the Middle English desti- nary in BL MS. Sloane 636, ff. 20-23, which considers only the part of fortune in its prognostics.`8 The variation and apparent confusion among textual rubrics indeed illustrate the destinary's close generic relationship to the electionary and lunary. The electionary considers the hour of nativity or birth as the most important area governed by elections and usually distin- guishes between males and females, just as the signs and planets are gender-oriented. The lunary, on the other hand, may consider nativity as only one of the areas influenced by the position of the moon and may not always make gender-oriented predictions. With the destinary, the starting point for the horoscope (Lat. horo- scopus, 'judging the hour') is the ascendant (Lat. ascendens, 'rising [time]') sign or planet upon the horizon at the moment of concep- tion or birth; this event takes place in the first of the twelve mundane houses (the first 30?-division of the ecliptic), and aspects and other accidents of the celestial bodies and signs which exist throughout the remaining houses (progressing in increasing ecliptic longitude) deter- mine the outcome of each of the topics which those houses govern- career, health, travel, and so on. These may be illustrated by a horo- scope figure, which "maps" the location of the twelve houses in noting the degrees of the cusps at counter-clockwise divisions, beginning with the first house, "life."59 Ix,1o x,9 K2I~ 581 owe knowledge of this text to Linda Ehrsam Voigts, "The Character of the carecter: Ambiguous Sigils in Scientific and Medical Texts," in Latin and Vernacular Studies in Late- Medieval Texts and Manuscripts, ed.

(More extensive use of figures will be discussed below in relation to questionaries.) Even physiognomy-the relationship between physical appearance and personality-is determined by the qualities of the planets and signs in the first house, a complex set of theories which arose out of Ptolemy's notion of the "Quality of the Soul."60 Taking Ptolemy's summary discussion of nativity in the Tetrabiblos as his starting point, Julius Firmicus Maternus (fl. 330-54) considerably expanded the material in Books V.1-7 and VI.28-31 of his Mat lesis, a popular handbook on astrology in the pseudo-Ptolemaic tradition; in fact, the sections on nativities were extracted and circulated sepa- rately.61 Much of this work was later adapted by Dorotheus, Abubather Alkasan (Abu Bakr, 800-50), then Messahalla. The latter's De Nativi- tatibus, or "Book of Nativities," circulated in several versions, one the translation of Hugh of Santalla (c. 1130), who also incorporated that portion of Albumasar's Tractatus which deals with the role of planets in natal horoscopes.62 The work on elections by Omar Alfraganus Tiberia- dis, or Adhomar (At-Tabari, + c. 815), was translated by John of Spain (1127).63 Zael's De Electionibus is largely drawn from Dorotheus and Messahalla.64 Albumasar produced several works on nativities, pri- marily based on Dorotheus: De Electionibus (translated by John of Spain and others) is related to Books 5 and 8 of De Magnis Conjuncionibus, and often entitled De Reuolutionibus Nativitatis or Tractatus de Natiuitatibus. After a general introduction on genethliacs, subsequent chapters de- 600n the Ptolemaic theory, see Tetrabiblos, 111.13, pp. 333-63; later treatments of the theory include, e.g., Galen's De Complexionibus, Oxford, Balliol College MS. 231, ff. 263- 8ov; and Robertus Anglicus, Commentary, in North, Richard of Wallingford, 209-10. There are innumerable Middle English works on the subject, e.g., "The Four Complexions of Man" in BodL MSS. Ashmole 1393 (pt. 5), ff. 62-63v; "Declaracyoun of the Com- plexyons," Ashmole 391, if. 95-loo; and Ashmole 189 (pt. 1), ff. 95-99v; and the verse "The Four Humours" (IMEV 2624), ed. Robbins, Secular Lyrics, no. 77. Daniel also in- cludes a digression on the subject in his Judgment of Urines, see, e.g., BodL MS. e Musaeo 187, ff. 6v-7. 61 Matheseos libri VIII, 11:3-66, 132-74. The extract on horoscopes was printed as De Nativitatibus, ed. Franciscus Niger (Venice: Aldus Manutius, June-October 1499). 62 On its complex textual tradition, see Carmody, 36-37; and Lynn Thorndike, "The Latin Translation of Astrological Works by Messahala," Osiris 12 (1956), 49-72; see also vol. IX of A Dictionary of Scientific Biography, ed. in chief, Charles Coulston Gillispie (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1974), 160-61.

Most influential upon the Middle English destinaries was Firmicus Maternus' format, de- rived, in turn, from Ptolemy, which, after an earlier section on apotesma (the effects of heavenly bodies upon man's destiny) in Book III, begins the nativity section proper in Book V with prognostics for individu- als whose horoscope begins with the sun ascendant in Aries. Then, having gone through all twelve signs, he returns to prognostics based on the seven ascendant planets, beginning with Saturn, followed by consideration of effects of aspect within the signs (Saturn in Aries, and so on). Prognostics are detailed, and include all matters of physi- ognomy and profession; variations are the result of such accidents as triplicity, conjunction, or quartile, factors discussed more fully in Book VI. Albohali's treatise begins with birth while the sun is ascen- dant in Venus, but considers all other factors, such as triplicities with the sun, the birth sign or planet in aspect with the moon, or whether birth occurs during the day or night.69 Other astrological treatises may provide sections on nativities and their interpretation according to various determinants. Michael Scot's (+1235) Liber Introductorius pre- dicts horoscopes by the 28 lunar mansions as determined by the fixed stars, and the signs (see his text in BodL MS. Bodl. 266, f. 166v).

Ashmole 345, ff. 3b-5, 77-78b, 78b-80, probably based upon Zael, focuses upon determining fate ac- cording to whether the individual and the aspects are masculine or feminine (see the table for showing which degrees in every sign are masculine or feminine, with an English canon, in MS. Ashmole 340, f 14). A Middle English expression of at least one theoretical basis for the destinary is touched upon in the Judgment of Nativities (immedi- ately following John Eschenden's Introductory, BodL MS. Ashmole 396, ff. 126-86v); the text appears to be a more learned version of this genre, probably based upon Messahalla. Its incipit introduces the debate over the precise start of calculations, whether geniture (con- ception) or actual birth: The tyme of egression of the childe fro the moderis wombe is cleped the vray Natiuite. The sone alwaies accordath in the houre of Natiuite with the place that he was in at the houre of generacion, ffor euer he shall be in the 7, 9, 10, other 11 monthes. Hermes seith pat the place of the [moon glyphl at the houre of the shedynge of the Operine shal be ascendad in the issue of the creature and the ascendent of the shedyng shall be the place of the [moon glyphl in the issue of the creature. (f. 126) The author thus makes a distinction between Hermes's tradition (based upon where the moon is ascendant at the moment of birth) and his own (based upon where the sun is ascendant at birth, rather than conception). Yet Middle English destinary texts offer a wide variety of interpretations and methods for calculating destiny. The majority of texts appear to follow the format of sun ascendant in Aries-Pisces, as, for example, in The Book of the Destinary, which, in many manuscripts, forms part of The Wise Book of Philosophy and Astronomy. T he work begins by describing its initial purpose: Nowe hit is to declare and determine of the 12. sign ys and of ther kyndis what euery [body] is ordyned to be by the waye of kynde and predestinacion.

Add 12195,</page><page sequence="25">Laurel Means 391 Similarly, Henry Daniel's destinary, forming part of an astrological digression in his Judgement of Urines and based upon the sun's ascen- dancy at birth and commencing with Aries, begins "Thes ben the faces and fortunes of hem that ben born uppon the hovrs of the son by all the 12 signes."7 Alternatively, predictions based upon the ascendant sign at birth may not begin with Aries, but rather, following Haly Abenregal and the solar year, with the sun in that sign corresponding to the first month of the calendar year, Capricorn/January. An obvious example is BodL MS. Ashmole 343, ff. 2-22 (quoted above), which glosses in the margin each sign by calendar month and separates the destinies of men and women (again, a common Arabic tradition).73 Another example is the text entitled Predestynaciouns, attributed to "Esdre Pe prophete" (BL MS. Egerton 827, ff. 20-24v), which begins "lanuarius Sol in Aquario," with the entrance of the sun into Aquarius on 9 Janu- ary.74 Still others may begin with Aquarius/February, e.g., BL MS.

Bodley 591, ff. 39- 39v, begins "Quando natus est in Aquario nechligens erit," but then mixes in other prognostics for journeys and thunder in signs. Another macaronic destinary in MS. Digby 88, ff. 89-91 (with a nearly identical text also in Warminster, Longleat MS. 176, ff. 117v-18v), also begins with the sun in Aquarius, and compares conditions with biblical events (see n. 8o). There are other astronomical bases for establishing destinies, one of the most common being which planet is in the ascendant at the moment of birth. Thus, the destinary in BL MS. Egerton 2572, ff. 6iv- 64v, begins its account "of what bonthese or myschyfe" planets may be inclined to give those born under them, beginning with a child born under the sun. The destinary in BodL MS. Ashmole 210 (pt. 1), ff. 21XX-21XXV, begins with Saturn, stating that Thinges that we speke of in any nativity we saye true in al questions, but not so properly. [If] in any natiuite [Saturn glyph] be in the ascendent and also [Mercury glyph], pen the chyld shalbe a sender of lesunges and fowle of speche. The destinary of TCC MS. R.14.52, ff. 239-44v, also begins, "As ther bien vij planetis Saturnus of al is hier in his cervcle and he is the sig- nifier and tokener of auncient riche men and riches and religious and erth tiliers or ploughmen and of merchentys and old men." It con- tinues with prognostics based upon ascendancy of the other planets in the signs, but makes no distinction between men and women ex- cept for December/Capricorn (f. 242). A refinement of this approach is calculating those degrees in a planet's ecliptic which govern certain areas: CCC 3.36/725, ff. 43-44v, in fact, provides the Arabic and Latin names for such degrees, as gradus azamena (health) and auigeus fortuna (fortune). Destinaries based upon planetary influence may also calculate their 751 have been unable to assign this attribution specifically to any of Bartholomew's known texts; cf., e.g., ludiciurn Particulare de Mutationibus Aeris and the Ars GeornaWtiac, described Thorridike, History of Magic, 11:835-37. With this Middle English destinary may be compared two similar Latin versions in BodL MSS. Digby 95, ff. i-6, inlc.: "Qui natus fuerit in signo Aquaria honoratus erit"; and Digby 88, ff. 48-58, inc.: "Qui natus fuerit in signo aquarij erit honoratus"; see also T-K 1209. Although the Middle English text ends with birth in Capricorn/December, it begins all over again with another text, Aquarius-Capricorn, ff. 58-60v, this time making no distinction between the destinies of men and women.</page><page sequence="27">Laurel Means 393 prognostics on the basis of days of the week governed by certain plan- ets. Each planet reigns for the first and one other hour in its own day, beginning at midnight, to which it gives its name and imparts its influence upon whoever is born on that day. As one such text explains, As on Sonday reyneth Per Pe Son be furst oure in the mornynge. And also Pe vijth owre after midnyght. The mone in pe Mondaye rayneth lyke wyse and so forthe of odre planettys. And it is good to vndirston he lat is borne Pe Sondaye vndre ke constellacion of the Son shalbe sanguine and coleryke and a grete man and wytty and of grete honoure. (BodL Ashmole 189 [pt. 2], ff. 86v) A nearly identical text, with further variation, follows on ff. 87v-88v, followed in turn by similar versions on 88v-89, 89-91, and 93-95.76 (The high degree of variation in this series alone indicates the loose- ness of generic definition and demonstrates, once again, problems in identification.) Destinaries based upon week days form a section in some texts of The Wise Book of Astronomy and Philosophy; it may, in some manuscripts, immediately precede a destinary based upon signs, e.g., BodL MS. Selden Supra 73, ff. lOv-lIv (signs, ending imper- fectly with Virgo, ff. ilv-i8v), thus making it difficult to establish precise divisions of these particular texts, since they conflate several prognostic bases. Of considerable importance for the destinary is physiognomical theory: physical appearance and personal traits together are deter- mined by the signs and planets as they affect the four humors just as much as health, career, marriage, and fortune. The tradition, of course, goes back to Ptolemy's section on nativities in the Tetrabiblos, which describe the physical appearance and character of individuals (usually considered separately according to gender) born under certain condi- tions. Nearly every Middle English destinary contains some reference to physical appearance. A child born in Aries according to The Booke of the Destenarye, for example, "schall have a rownde face with swete blake browes" (f. 63b). The destinary in BodL MS. Ashmole 210 (pt. 1), 76 Other Middle English planet-destinaries include BodL MSS. Ashmole 210 (pt. 2), ff. 21XX-21xxv; Ashmole 393 (pt. 2), f. 32; BL MS. Harley 2378, f. 7; TTC MS.

Some focus upon individual mundane houses, such as health or profession. The destinary in BL MS. Sloane 965, if. 1-6, although based upon planets, focuses particularly upon the effects of gender: "Yef there be made a questione of the natiuite of man and the planets ben in the grees of the signe of masculyn, that shall be to hem a strengthe." Conversely, any nativity in a feminine sign disposes a person to weakness and small- ness of stature.79 The destinary in BodL MS. Digby 88, f. 78v (IMEP III:40[23J) considers "a man that has fortune of the weddur" and its effect upon his physiognomy and prosperity. Because one prognostic text may have much in common with another, generic demarcations of the destinary may be blurred. It is possible that many destinaries are "hidden" in texts erroneously labelled. At least one text previously thought to be a lunary is in fact a destinary: the macaronic verse prognostics in BodL MS. Digby 88, ff. 89-91 (IMEV 1253), describe the fate of those born with the sun ascen- dant in each sign, beginning with Aquarius (January), and make com- parisons between signs and biblical events: Aquarius/Christ's baptism in the River Jordan, to Capricorn/Esau's loss of his father's blessing through a goat-skin.80 77 Cf.

Manzalaoui, Secreta Secre- toruw: Ninie English Versions, EETS 276 (London: Oxford University Press), 10-14 and 89-113 respectively. Derived ultimately from the pseudo-Aristotelian De Physiognonica, there is no reference in the Secreta to astrological influence. 78 For example, The sothefast conyng of astrology: "The manchild borne Pat sesen [Aries] shal haue his token in his hed on Pe ri3t syde. He may not be of grete stature, but litel men or metely persons, and glad his lyf schalbe," BodL MS.

The text is simi- lar to the Latin BL MS. Egerton 821, ff. 7v-8v, rubricated as a lunary and so printed by Max Forster, "Vom Fortleben antiker Sammellunare im Englischen und in anderen Volksprachen," Anglia 67 (1944), 20. The Wise Book of Astronomiy and Philosophy gives a prose paraphrase of parallels between signs, biblical events, and their influence upon the destiny of men: see Jeanne Krochalis and Edward Peters, eds., The World of Piers Plowmttan (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1975), 6-7.</page><page sequence="29">Laurel Means 395 (4) QUESTIONARY (INTERROGATIONS) In one sense, all prognosticary works are questionaries insofar as they provide answers to questions directed toward specific topics: What fate is in store for a child born when the sun is ascendant in Aries? Is it safe to travel on the fifth day of the moon? But, in a narrower definition, "a questionary is only concerned with specific questions, who and how they are asked, and the means by which they may be answered." These are organized according to specific topics, usually based upon areas of life governed by the twelve mun- dane houses located on the twelve positions of a horoscope. According to the plan of the encyclopedic and highly influential Latin ques- tionary Liber Novem Iudicium in Judicij Astrorum (version II), the first concerns life; the second money and possessions; the third relatives; the fourth agriculture, things hidden (especially treasure); the fifth nativity, rumors, letters; the sixth medicine, slaves, marriage, disputes, favor with the king, business transactions; the seventh escaped slaves, fugitives, law, friendships; the eighth travel; the ninth dreams, navi- gation; the tenth kings; the eleventh the soul, hope, love; the twelfth horses, meteorology, war.8" Questions about each of these topics is answered according to the configuration of various elections, e.g., the sun ascendant in Aries, or Mars in conjunction with Venus. To "cast a figure," or to "domyfy," in order to have a question (or questions) answered is to work out a square horoscope figure of twelve parts, similar to that used for destinies. The starting point for the configu- ration of the first house, whether ascendant sign or planet, could be determined by different factors, but usually questions are calculated according to the hour of the nativity of the questioner or the hour when the question was asked. Answers would thus be determined by the configuration of accidents within the appropriate house. Although the questionary thus includes all the material contained in other prog- nosticary genres, it organizes it in a different way. It can be as com- prehensive as the lunary, but differs from the lunary in not depending solely upon the lunar cycle for its prognostications. The questionary can consider nativity as does the electionary, but usually with regard only to specifically directed questions. Thus, for example, when the Middle English text "If a question be made of the nativity of man" (BL 81 See especially the 499 chapters of version I1 (fragments combined with other trea- tises), in BodL MS. Digby 47, ff. 104-54v. For a summary of the questions asked, see Carmody, 107-12.</page><page sequence="30">396 Middle English Prognostic Material MS. Sloane 965, ff. 3-6, and other manuscripts, see above) appears at first to be a questionary, the nature of its contents would reveal that the topics concerned and their treatment places this particular text in the destinary category. As well, the questionary has common ele- ments with certain charms, which may ask such questions as "Will a sick man live or die?" (Cambridge, Magdalene College MS. Pepys 878, p. 81) or "Who is the thief?" (BL MS. Additional 12195, f. 82v, 98, see IMEP V:45-46[21, [3]; TTC MS. R. 14.51, f. 28; and Cambridge, Magda- lene College MS. Pepys 1236, f. 90v). Yet charms seek the answers by methods other than astrological, e.g., by writing letters on objects. The most important Arabic sources for the questionary include Mes- sahalla's De Receptione Planetarum siue de Interrogationibus (translated by John of Spain); De Interpretatione Cogitantis; and De Occultis, which, largely concerning the location of lost objects, incorporates earlier work by Ptolemy and Dorotheus (his De OCCUltiS).82 Zael's De Interroga- tionibus and Albumasar's Liber Interrogationum also incorporated earlier material.3 There are many variant texts of these works, e.g., the De Judiciis Astrologicis attributed to John of Spain in BodL MS. Digby 149, ff. 195-200. Some are of dubious Ptolemaic origin.m While a few later redactions of Messahalla's treatise on interrogations are in effect noth- ing more than astrological compendia, as for the widely circulated Liber Novem ludicium in Judicij Astrorum, which includes material from Alkindus, Zael, Dorotheus, Ptolemy, and others, many works extract aspects of the subject to provide more specialized texts. Indeed, the tangle of sources and extracts which such an encyclopedic work con- tains illustrates how difficult it is to declare with any confidence the precise source of any Middle English questionary-or indeed, any other prognostic work. Although the various redactions of these texts differ, they generally begin with establishing the nature of the ques- tioner (whether present or absent), the questions asked (whether con- cerning hidden things or not), and the time of the questioning (with regard to astronomical time and astrological aspect).85 82 DSB IX:16i. On Latin translations and textual traditions, see Thorndike, "Latin Translation of Astrological Works by Messahala", 49-72; and Carmody, 26-29. 83 See Thorndike, History of Magic, 1:649-52; and Carmody, 40-46. 84 On Ptolemaic attributions, see Carmody, 21. 85 This format is followed, e.g., in the Latin interrogationes contained in BodL MS. Digby 194, ff. 127v-38, which conclude with a series of sample questions, chiefly related to death and illness (ff. 130-31). Abbreviated texts, such as those in MS. Digby 149, may contain only extracts: f. 201, Tractatus Dorotheus in OccUltis; f. 202, Secutndum Ptholoneumri (on aspects and dignities); f. 202V, Messahalla's De Occultis (whether things hidden are where they should be; and ff. 195-200, on questions for the mundane houses.</page><page sequence="31">Laurel Means 397 Parts of these works may appear in others which are not, strictly speaking, questionaries. For example, Michael Scot considers many astrological topics such as nativity and the influence of the 28 lunar mansions in his Liber Introductorius, but Distinctio III of that work focuses upon Interrogationes. There he begins by describing the two methods of determining the answers to questions: the first uses an astrolabe or quadrant to find the ascendant sign, then the planet which is its lord, finally the whole disposition of other planets and signs. The second reads the bulla or swellings of the body to determine the ascendant; if it occurs on the head, for example, the ascendant sign is Aries.A6 Scot considers the types of questions which will be dealt with: whether the questioner is absent, whether the questions con- cern illness, death, or other topics. Scot cites Messahalla as his main source, but it is probably through a compendium such as the Liber Novem ludiciis. 87 Similarly, Roger of Hereford's Liber de Quatuor Partibus Astronomie Judicorum treats interrogations as de cogitatione in part 2 (see BodL MS. Digby 149, ff. 189-95). Among the most popular forms of the questionary are those con- cerning hidden or "occult" things. These are usually attributed to Dorotheus (see, e.g., his Tractatus in Occultis, BodL MS. Digby 194, ff. 139-39v), or Messahalla's De Cogitantionibus ab Intentione, or De In- ventionibus Occultorum. 8 With such a range of material, then, it is not surprising that the Middle English versions of the questionary are highly varied. The Secretes of Astronomye in BodL MS. Bodley 396, ff. 189-92v, appears to be an adaptation of Messahalla's De Cogitantionibus, with its initial consideration of whether the questioner is known, the reasons for the questions, and the examination of ascendants in the signs. It goes on to consider the planets as lords in their own celestial houses (domus essentiales) and then the nature of the questions in the mundane or domus naturales.89 The short questionaries in BodL MS.

The sign containing the degrees of fortune (see n. 57 above) determines the nature of the question to be asked, e.g., if in Leo, then the question will concern children, (ff. 92- 93V); if ascendant in a fixed sign, then the questioner "intends no ill." A similar extract, "How a person shall demand his question," is found in the same manuscript (pt. 5), f. 87.9? Many questionary texts are concerned with the sixth mundane house, health and illness. These include BodL MSS. Ashmole z1o, (pt. 2), ff. 16-20 (inc.: "Whether hit be for a phesicion or surgyn to take cure vppone hym or not.

Ashmole 210 (pt. 2), ff. 31-33, considers only one question, travel, which is governed by the eighth mundane house (inc.: "Hit is con- venient to euery man that he begynne no jorneye but it be disposyd after his natiuite").

It also calculates on the basis of the lord (planet or sign) of the house governing the purpose of the journey.93 Other Middle English questionaries may ask exclusively about things hidden or not seen, normally covered by the fourth mundane house, a topic usually considered in larger works, e.g., BodL MS. Ashmole 396, f. 189v, in which a horoscope or twelve-house figure entitled "Of hyd pinges" is provided and worked out in some detail. These gener- ally bear some relationship, although never exact, to the procedures as outlined in Dorotheus's De Occultis. Topics include colors, tastes, and savors (as in BodL MS. Ashmole 210 [pt. 2], f. 21), or the urine of a patient not actually examined. In the text following in the same manu- script, ff. 22-23v, this is done by working out the ascendants of the lords of the urine or the liver (Scorpio in melothesiac theory), which generates the urine through the blood. Should an actual sample be provided, and the bearer is related to the patient, then the calculations are made from the third house of the ascendant.94 "Where fugitives have gone" is another favorite question for this house, e.g., in BodL MS. Ashmole 210 (pt. 1), f. 36. The questionary may depend upon geomancy for its answers. Geo- mancy provides answers to questions by casting a series of dots or points, originally on the ground, hence geos, 'earth.' The dots are then divided up according to odd or even patterns of from four to eight dots each to form four initial figures. There are sixteen possible figures in all, each given a name, e.g., Via, 'way of travel' ; Fortuna Maior, 'success' II; or Carcer, 'place' The four figures cast first are then used to devise a shield-like diagram, containing sixteen figures in all: eight in the top row, four in the sec- ond, two in the third, and two in the fourth. The first four figures are called "mothers," and the dot-patterns then transferred in sequence to form the second four figures, named "daughters." A similar procedure produces the third set of four figures, named "nieces" (usually des- 93 This treatise appears somewhat related to travel lunaries; see especially those in BL MS.

The first twelve positions on the shield correspond to twelve mundane houses; the thirteenth and fourteenth positions govern time future and time past, while the last two provide "judgment." Each figure is governed by a planet and sign, e.g., Via/Leo, Moon, and is to be interpreted according to the usual astrological determinants, such as aspect. In some texts, the significatores are the figures representing the subject and object of the question, while the first figure always depicts the questioner.95 The most inmportant geomantic treatises for the Middle Ages, trans- lated and adapted from original Arabic works by Messahalla, Alkin- dus, Dorotheus, and others, were Hugh of Santalla's Ars Geoman- tiae; Gerard of Cremona's Ars Geomancia; Bartholomew of Parma's Ars Geomantiae in the Summa (1288); and Martin of Spain's De Geomancia (c. 1319).9 Michael Scot's Liber Geomantiae (c. 1230) represents the theo- retical aspects of geomancy, but in Distinctio III of his Liber Introducto- rius he also describes the sixteen figures with regard to interrogationes. Some manuscripts of this work include large, anthropomorphic draw- ings of the planets and signs, each with the geomantic figure it gov- erns.97 Summarizing Messahalla, Dorotheus, Alkindi, and Alcorayth, Scot outlines the procedure for answering interrogations according to the geomantic method: the two chief things to note are the lord of the ascendant and position of the moon, although Albumasar, he says, advised that five points be noted: (1) the lord of the fourth house; (2) the lord of the house of the moon, or the moon itself; (3) the planet to which the moon was joined before; (4) the lord of the house of pars fortunae; and (5) the lord of the fourth sign from the moon, in which it is proved to have delayed.98 Some Middle English questionaries are based upon these geomantic methods, although their precise sources are far from obvious. A pos- sible source is Martin of Spain's De Geomancia, either in the original or in its Middle English translation, which is found in BodL MS. Ashmole 95 On this important difference, see Charmasson, Recherches sur unLe techniqiue diz'tia- toire, 51-52. 96 On these and other geomantic writings, see especially Charmasson, Recherches stir une technique divinitoire, and Thorndike, History of Magic, 1:110o-15, 835-38. 97 For their description, see Thorndike, Michael Scot, 99-102, 108-109; and Franz Boll, Sphaera: neue griechische Texte und Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der Sterulbilder (Leipzig: B.

The Latin portion discusses questionary technique through geomantic fig- ures and categories of hypothetical questions based upon the twelve houses. Immediately following on ff. 44V-47v in an early sixteenth- century hand is a Middle English questionary proposing questions according to the twelve houses: these begin with Prima Domus, the 'state of a man's body,' and end with the twelfth house, 'on enemies and prison.' The questions contain many not included in Martin's Latin text, e.g., the determining of property rights under the fourth house.9 A similar but unrelated text, purporting to be "The boke of geomancy" derived from the pseudo-Ptolemeic Centiloquium, is found in BL MS. Sloane 636, ff. 32v. A large number of questionaries based upon geomantic figures are contained in BL MS. Harley 671. The first, ff. 73-81, discusses the nature of mobile, stable, and mediocre (i.e., mixed) signs, since this is significant for those ill or in prison. Favorable aspects may be pro- vided by the figures when in the four angles. Other considerations are the effects of day or night. The work concludes with how to know the "end of a questione" by taking the points from the middle of the figures and re-casting them from the ninth to the fifteenth to form a sixteenth figure, which serves as a final "judge." The text which im- mediately follows, ff. 81v-84, "Her beginnys a tretis to find a mans name," describes how to mark the house of the ascending sign for the individual concerned, then, after keeping in mind the governing planets and figures for that sign, translate the figures into their corre- sponding letters of the alphabet: the first figure will be the beginning letter, the fifth the end, and the seventh and tenth the middle. This technique is related to the divinatory practice usually associated with the Pythagorean numbers and letters method.l10 The text in BL MS.

Questionaries, especially those based upon geomantic figures, con- tinued to be copied and circulated in England longer than any other type of prognostic text. Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, his brother John, Duke of Bedford, and Henry VI all possessed deluxe Latin editions of geomantic treatises containing interrogationes. 101 Guido Bonatti's Liber Astronomicus, with its questions, was produced for Henry VII in BL MS. Arundel 66, ff. 48-249. The sixteenth-century copies of English questionaries in BodL MSS. Ashmole 360, 417, and 1478 have been described above, and there are doubtless many others yet to be studied, e.g., BL MS. Sloane 1437. Simon Forman's case books, c. 1575-1600, are filled with questionary theory and actual horoscope figures with the casts of every possible type of question, both from himself ("whether I might obtain Elizabeth Briscot, if I laboured the latter"), or his clients (the whereabouts of Mrs. Blague's cup, which, incidentally, also required a geomantic figure).'02 As this description of four major prognostic text-types suggests, there still remains much work to be done. Many-in fact, most-indi- vidual texts are yet to be edited, and sources or interrelationships are still to be determined.

The larger category includes critical days (often called "perilous" or "Egyptian"), many contained in the same manuscripts, and in some cases scarcely to be distinguished from lunaries or phlebotomy/medi- cal texts (see n. 52 above). Another group includes the many types of meteorological prognostications (see n. 26 above). There are, as well, what one might designate as purely divinatory texts, not only of the Pythagorean Wheel type (see n. 100 above), but also those that pre- dict without specific astrological reference but yet may be based upon astrological principles.103 Yet all these works are interrelated, since they form part of the same astrological system.
