Beebe, Barry Wade and John Duncan Applied Safety Technologies Corporation Randy Kelly and James L. Blaker Robert A. Denton, Inc. ABSTRACT A cooperative project between the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Civil Aeromedicai Institute (CAMI), Applied Safety Technologies Corp. (ASTC), and Robert A. Denton, Inc. was conducted to investigate modifica- tions to the standard Hybrid III anthropomorphic test dummy (ATD) lumbar spine and its interface to the pelvis and thorax. The impetus for this project was based on the desires of aviation researchers, manufacturers, and dynamic test laboratories to utilize the Hybrid III ATD in the development and certification of aircraft seats. The goal was to develop a lumbar spine modification for the Hybrid III that would produce similar responses to those measured with a Hybrid II. The primary focus of this project was the compressive force measured at the base of the lumbar column during the vertical test condition required by FAA's regulations. Analysis of loads imparted to the seat by the Hybrid III, as well as the kinematics of head motion during forward-facing horizontal dynamic impact tests, were also performed as part of this effort. INTRODUCTION FAA regulations (1) for seats certified by dynamic impact test procedures include pass/fail criteria based on mea- sured responses from a 50łh percentile male ATD. These regulations, which were first formally proposed in 1986 and then adopted in 1988, specify: "The tests must be conducted with an occupant simulated by a 170-pound anthropomorphic test dummy, as defined by 49 CFR Part 572, Subpart B, or its equivalent, sitting in the normal upright position." The ATD identified in the regulations is most commonly referred to as the Hybrid II. During the period of the early 1980s, when the requirements for dynamic seat certification tests were being developed by the FAA (2,3,4), the 50th percentile male Hybrid II ATD was the only adult size ATD specified in government reg- ulations for occupant crash protection (5). These automobile-related regulations that were issued by the National Highway Traffics Safety Administration (NHTSA) included rigorous specifications and calibration standards for the Hybrid II. It was also the most widely used dummy in biomechanics research. Concurrent with the FAA's activities to define dynamic seat performance criteria, the next generation of ATD, identified as the Hybrid III, was being developed by gov- ernment and industry researchers in the automotive arena of biomechanics (6). Compared to the Hybrid II, significant changes were made in the major body seg- ments of the Hybrid III, including the head, neck, thorax, and pelvis-lumbar region. In addition to improved biofi- delity achieved through the re-design of various body segments, the Hybrid III provided a major increase in the number of locations that could be instrumented to mea- sure biomechanical responses. In 1986, NHTSA included the Hybrid III in automotive occupant crash pro- tection regulations.. The specification and calibration standards for the Hybrid III were defined in 49 CFR Part 572 Subpart E. FAA SEAT CERTIFICATION POLICY - Although the improvements of the biofidelty and instrumentation in the Hybrid III are widely acknowledged, it has not been accepted by the FAA for certification tests of civil aircraft seats. A primary reason for this policy has been attrib- uted to differences in the lumbar spine and pelvic regions of the Hybrid III compared to the Hybrid II. One of the pass/fail criteria in FAA's regulations is a maximum force of 1500 lbs. measured at the base of the lumbar column of a Hybrid II ATD during a vertical test condition. The Hybrid II has a straight lumbar column which results in an erect-spine seated posture; whereas, the Hybrid III lum- bar column is curved and produces more of a "slouched" lower spine seated posture. The slouched posture of the 367</page><page sequence="2">Hybrid III, especially in the lumbar region, has not been shown to produce "equivalent" responses to the Hybrid II. These differences affect two key measurements involved in aircraft seat certification: 1) the compressive axial force in the lumbar spine, and 2) the kinematics of upper torso flail motion and resultant head trajectory. There is also a difference in mass distribution in the pelvic area. This is an important consideration in the performance of aircraft seats that are designed to attenuate or limit the forces experienced by the occupant as well as the struc- tural loads in the seat frame and its attachments to the aircraft. "EQUIVALENT ATD" ISSUES - The objective of the FAA's requirement that the ATD used in aircraft seat tests be "equivalent" to the Hybrid II is to ensure that all certi- fied seats are tested and certified in a consistent manner. The ATD used in certification tests must provide three important functions: • The ATD represents the mass properties of a 50th percentile male occupant, and imparts the dynamic loads of an occupant to the seat and restraint sys- tems during the test. • The ATD functions as an instrument to measure the occupant injury criteria required by the regulation. • The motion of the articulated body segments pro- vides a means to observe and measure the ATD's torso, limb, and head kinematics. For an ATD to be considered equivalent to the Hybrid II, these three properties must similar to the Hybrid II. Fur- thermore, the measured and observed results from dynamic impact tests must be consistent. These results include loads reacted by the seat and restraint system, responses acquired from instrumentation within the ATD, and flail envelopes measured from photometric analysis. MODIFIED HYBRID III LUMBAR SPINE PROJECT The project presented in this report was a collaborative effort between CAMI, Applied Safety Technologies Cor- poration, and Robert A. Denton, Inc. The goals were to develop modifications to the standard Hybrid III which closely replicate the physical characteristics of a Hybrid II and produce similar impact responses. The approach in developing these modifications was to utilize standard available components of the two ATDs and minimize the number of unique parts that must be acquired to config- ure the straight-spine Hybrid III. The following summarizes the ATD comparison data, modifications developed for the Hybrid III, the impact test procedures, and acquired responses from this series of tests: COMPARISON OF STANDARD HYBRID II AND HYBRID III ATDS -Table 1 presents some of the physical varia- tions between the Hybrid II and Hybrid III ATDs. Figure A-1 in the appendix of this report illustrates differences in the design of the ATDs. One obvious difference is the curvature of the Hybrid III lumbar spine versus the straight spine of the Hybrid II. Note that the adapter block between the lumbar column and the pelvis of the Hybrid III positions the lumbar column more toward the posterior compared to the Hybrid II. Also, the vertical axis of the lumbar column, which is shorter and less flexi- ble than the Hybrid II lumbar column, is not perpendicular to the horizontal reference plane of the pelvis. The Hybrid II lumbar column vertical axis is aligned perpen- dicular to the pelvis. The "slouched" seated posture of the Hybrid III, effected by the curved lumbar spine, results in a lower seated height of the ATD compared to the Hybrid II. The position of the Hybrid Ill's head, which is approximately 2 inches lower than the Hybrid II's head at the start of an impact, affects the head path during the test. This is an impor- tant issue to aircraft seat tests. For example, gross head excursions measured from forward facing lap-belt-only seat tests can affect the seat's installation limitations, based on whether the ATD's head would strike (or miss) a structure located forward of the seat. Another important difference between the two standard ATDs is in the mass of the pelvis-lumbar region. The combined weight of the pelvis, lumbar adapter block, lum- bar column and abdominal insert for the standard Hybrid II is 35.4 lbs. The weight for the same components in a Hybrid III is 45.4 lbs. This difference in mass affects not only the responses acquired from the lower lumbar load cell, but it also effects the inertial loads reacted by the seat and restraint system. MODIFIED HYBRID III FOR AIRCRAFT SEAT TESTS - Previous efforts by CAMI to modify the standard curved- spine Hybrid III into a straight-spine version that would provide similar results to a Hybrid II were not successful. The first attempt utilized a lower lumbar load cell adapter that positioned the Hybrid II lumbar column toward the posterior of the Hybrid III pelvis. A pedestrian thorax-to- upper lumbar adapter was also installed. This configura- tion, in effect, replaced the curved lumbar column with a straight column located in approximately the same posi- tion relative to the pelvis as a standard Hybrid III. The seated posture of the spine was acceptable. However, forces measured in the vertical axis of the lumbar spine during impact tests were not consistent with impact data from a standard Hybrid II. 368</page><page sequence="3">Table 1 .

FAA Hybrid III For the second attempt, a straight lumbar column, a pel- vis adapter with load cell, and a pedestrian thorax-to- upper lumbar adapter were installed on a Hybrid III pelvis in approximately the same relative location as that of a Hybrid II. The lumbar column was positioned anterior on the pelvis compared to the first attempted modification. The lumbar axial force response from this modification was similar to those acquired with a Hybrid II. However, the seated posture was considered peculiar and not rep- resentative of a Hybrid II. A Hybrid III chest jacket and abdominal insert were uti- lized with both of the modification attempts described above. However, the bending stiffness of the assembled pelvis, lumbar, and upper torso was not within the calibra- tion response corridor for the standard Hybrid II. The FAA Hybrid III - The modifications to a Hybrid III ATD presented in this report are illustrated in Figures A-1 and A-2 in the appendix to this report. Table 1 includes information on the physical measurements resulting from this modification, and Figure 1 shows the assembled ATD. Compared to the previous trial modification efforts at CAMI, this configuration for the Hybrid III pelvis-lumbar region more closely matched the important characteris- tics of the Hybrid II that affect the results of aircraft seat certification tests. The "FAA Hybrid III" modification con- sists of the following: 1. Replace the Hybrid III lumbar-pelvic adapter block with a Denton Model 1891 Hybrid II Lumbar Load Cell and the pelvic adapter block for the load cell. 2. Replace the Hybrid III lumbar column with a standard Hybrid II lumbar column, which attaches to the Den- ton lumbar load cell and pelvic adapter block assem- bly 3. Replace the Hybrid III upper lumbar-thorax adapter with a unique adapter, which is described below. 4. Replace the Hybrid III abdominal insert with a stan- dard Hybrid II abdominal insert. 5. Replace the Hybrid III upper leg elements with Hybrid II upper leg elements. 6. Replace the Hybrid III chest flesh jacket with the chest flesh from a Hybrid II. A notch should be cut from the chest flesh in the region of the lower neck to prevent interference with neck flexion. 369</page><page sequence="4">Figure 2. Rigid seat in combined horizontal-vertical orientation. Figure 3. Rigid seat in horizontal orientation Figure 4. Examples of combined horizontal-vertical impact deceleration pulse The Denton Model 1 891 Lumbar Load Cell can be bolted to the existing hole pattern in the Hybrid III pelvis. Thus, no additional tapped holes or machining is required on the Hybrid III pelvis. The Hybrid II lumbar column attaches to the load cell and adapter block in the same manner as would be followed with a standard Hybrid II installation. Figure 5. Examples of horizontal impact deceleration pulse Replacing the upper leg elements results in mass distri- bution between the pelvis and upper legs more represen- tative of a Hybrid II. Changing the chest flesh jacket to a Hybrid II accommodates a firm fit of the Hybrid II abdom- inal insert. The Hybrid III abdominal insert is too loose when used with the Hybrid II chest jacket, and the Hybrid II abdominal insert will not fit properly if used with the Hybrid III chest flesh jacket. Only one of the six items above, the upper lumbar-thorax adapter, is not a standard component of a Hybrid II or Hybrid III. Shown in Figure A-3 of the appendix, this item is similar to the lumbar-thorax adapter in the pedestrian spine version of the Hybrid III. It is required to provide proper alignment for an erect spine seated posture. Also, this adapter is constructed from steel rather than alumi- num to provide a slight increase in mass to closer match the Hybrid II's upper torso weight. Figure 6.

Seat Pan Fz from Hybrid II and FAA Hybrid III - Tare Compensated The modified Hybrid III configured with the above compo- nents will pass the lumbar flexion test specified in the cal- ibration procedures for the Hybrid II. Thus, the bending stiffness is representative of a Hybrid II. A detailed description of the components necessary to configure the FAA Hybrid III ATD is contained in the users manual for the FAA Hybrid III (7). TEST METHODS, INSTRUMENTATION, AND PROTO- COL - Dynamic impact tests were conducted with a stan- dard Hybrid II, a standard Hybrid III, and a FAA Hybrid III ATD to investigate baseline differences in various responses. The tests were performed at the CAM I Biody- namics Research Laboratory, which utilizes a horizontal deceleration test sled. The tests were performed with a rigid seat fixture, shown in Figures 2 and 3, to minimize the effects of seat performance, such as dynamic stiff- ness and plastic deformation. The test conditions, described below, were based on those specified in FAA regulations for certifying transport category aircraft seats. Test Orientation and Severity - There were two orienta- tions of the seat for these tests. The first was a combined horizontal-vertical orientation, as shown in Figure 2. This is commonly referred to as the "60° pitch test." Tests in this orientation were performed with an impact pulse typi- cal of those shown in Figure 4, which conform to condi- tions identified as Test 1 (14 Gpk min., 35 f/s min.) in 14 CFR Part 25.562. The second orientation was horizontal with no yaw angle between the seat and impact vector, as shown in Figure 3. Typical impact pulses for tests con- ducted in this configuration are shown in Figure 5. The pulse shape conforms to conditions identified as Test 2 (16 Gpk, 44 f/s min.) in the same regulation. Instrumentation - Sensors installed in the ATDs, in partic- ular the lower lumbar load cell, were typical of currently available devices designed to be installed without modifi- cation to the ATD. The lumbar load cells used in this project were considered typical of those most frequently used by test labs performing aircraft seat certification tests. Lap belt anchor and seat pan loads were mea- sured with triaxial load cells attached to the rigid seat. Data acquisition and processing were in accordance with the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Recom- mended Practice J21 1 . Photometric analysis was per- formed using 1 000 frame/sec video or 500 frame/sec film images. Protocol - Impact tests were conducted with each of the three ATDs in the two orientations described above. In most cases, three tests were repeated with each ATD to assess repeatability. The protocol included procedures to insure the position of the ATD (e.g., the location ana- tomical reference targets relative to the seat reference point (SRP) on the seat) was replicated from test-to-test. 371</page><page sequence="6">Table 2.

Right lap belt anchor forces Figure 1 1 . Upper torso restraint common strap tension One factor of the test protocol that had slight differences during the series of tests was the deceleration pulse. The sled deceleration pulses shown in Figures 4 and 5 illustrate these differences. For the purpose of compari- son of responses acquired from the seat and ATDs, peak values of the lumbar axial compression force (lumbar Fz) and seat pan vertical force (seat pan Fz) were normal- ized based on the peak magnitude of the deceleration pulse. The combined horizontal-vertical test data was normalized to a 1 5 Gpk deceleration pulse severity. This is the same type of analytical procedure allowed for adjustment of the lumbar force as well as torso restraint loads from aircraft seat certification tests (8). RESULTS AND COMPARISON OF ATD RESPONSES LUMBAR FORCE - Figure 6 shows responses of the lumbar Fz from a standard Hybrid II and Hybrid III ATD acquired during two tests with each ATD in the combined horizontal-vertical orientation. Table 2 summarizes the peak loads from the tests in this configuration. The curved-spine Hybrid III produced a lower lumbar Fz peak than the Hybrid II. This result was expected, due to the angled orientation of the lumbar load cell relative to the pelvis and the load path through the curved lumbar col- umn. When the peak lumbar Fz response from three tests are normalized (based on a 15 Gpk test) and aver- aged, the Hybrid III lumbar Fzavg is 971 lbs. The normal- ized and averaged peak response from three tests with the Hybrid II is 1262 lbs. This difference of 291 lbs. indi- cates the standard curved-spine Hybrid III peak lumbar force is 23% less than the Hybrid II when tested under these conditions. A comparison of the lumbar Fz force data from tests of the FAA Hybrid III ATD and a standard Hybrid II is shown in Figure 7 and included in Table 2. When the data from three tests of the FAA Hybrid III are normalized to a 15 Gpk deceleration and averaged, the average peak lum- bar Fzavg is 1262 lbs. This average peak lumbar Fz is the same as value that was acquired from the standard Hybrid II. 372</page><page sequence="7">Figure 1 2. Comparison of Head Trajectories Lap belt horizontal tests Figure 1 3. Comparison of Head Trajectories 4-point restraints - horizontal tests SEAT PAN REACTION FORCE - Typical seat pan reac- tion forces, measured in the vertical axis of the seat pan during tests with a standard Hybrid II and Hybrid III ATD, is shown in Figure 8. A comparison of typical seat pan Fz reactions from a Hybrid II and the FAA Hybrid III is shown in Figure 9. Note that the data on these two plots have been tare compensated (e.g. the inertial loads from the seat pan and load cell have been subtracted from recorded data) and normalized to a 1 5 Gpk test severity. Thus, these two plots represent the loads from the ATDs on the seat pan. Normalized peak loads from seat pan Fz data are included in Table 2. Comparison of the peak responses acquired by this test method does not indicate any gross differences in the seat pan Fz force induced by the three ATDs. Each pro- duced a slightly different response time-history shape or signature. As noted in Table 2, the normalized peak aver- age from the FAA Hybrid III was 4.8% less than the stan- dard Hybrid II. This may be partially due to differences in upper leg loads reacted by the seat pan. The data presented for seat pan force response is from combined horizontal-vertical orientation "lap-belt-only" tests in which the ATDs' upper torso flailed forward about the belts. The peak loads in the seat pan Fz occurred immediately prior to upper torso flail. Differences in the seat pan Fz response shapes were likely affected by dif- ferences in the flail dynamics of the ATDs. Table 3.

These data plots are the magnitude of the resultant force measured with a triaxial load cell at the belt anchor on the rigid seat. (The plots presented in Figure 10 are not normalized to account for differences in test severity.) The peak values of the average lap belt anchor forces are listed in Table 3. Belt anchor forces from the standard Hybrid III horizontal test exhibited a distinctly higher peak than the responses from tests with a Hybrid II and FAA Hybrid III. This may be attributed to the greater mass of the Hybrid III pelvis section, as well as dynamic flail differ- ences when compared to the other two ATDs. There does not appear to be a major difference between the responses from tests with the Hybrid II or FAA Hybrid III ATDs. Upper torso restraint loads were also compared for these three ATDs. A 4-point military crew restraint with a MA-6 inertia reel was installed on the rigid seat, and each of the ATDs was tested in the horizontal test condition described previously. The tests were conducted with the inertia reel in the auto lock mode. Webbing tension in the common-strap of the upper torso belts was recorded as a means of comparing ATD torso restraint loads. Figure 1 1 shows typical responses from the three ATDs. Table 3 includes the plateau average tension in the upper torso restraint common strap. There was very little difference in the upper torso restraint loads acquired from the three ATDs. Peak values of the lap belt anchor forces and the average values of the torso common-strap tension loads during the plateau period of the data are also listed in Table 3. HEAD KINEMATICS - Figures 12, 13, 14, and 15 present the results from the photometric analysis of the head tra- jectory for each of the three ATDs. The plots in these fig- ures were produced from high-speed videos of horizontal tests with "lap-belt-only" and 4-point restraints on the rigid seat. The dimensions indicated on the figures are relative to a lateral axis through the seat reference point (SRP), which is the intersection of the seat back and pan on the rigid seat. Table 3 includes the maximum forward excursion of the top of the ATD's head for these tests. There are three important details evident in these plots. First, the initial position of the head center of gravity (CG) target on the FAA Hybrid III is nearly coincident with the initial position of the Hybrid II. However, the standard Hybrid Ill's head was approximately 4.5 inches forward and 2.2 inches below the initial position of the Hybrid II. Second, the maximum forward excursion of top of the standard Hybrid Ill's head during the lap-belt-only tests was approximately 1.2 inches less than the excursion of the Hybrid II or FAA Hybrid III. The third important detail is shown in Figures 14 and 15. There are obvious differences in head velocities of the three ATDs. The FAA Hybrid III produced the highest velocity in both the horizontal lap-belt-only and the 4-point restraint tests; whereas, the Hybrid III had the lowest head velocity in both test modes. Figure 14 indi- cates that during the lap-belt-only tests the FAA Hybrid III head velocity data compares closer to the head velocity of the Hybrid II than does the Hybrid III. The similarity between the Hybrid II and FAA Hybrid III head kinematics described above is important, especially at the higher magnitudes and excursions acquired from the lap-belt-only tests. The pass/fail criteria associated with this requirement is the Head Injury Criteria (HIC), which is a computation based on head impact accelera- tion data. The severity of head impact on structures that are located forward of an occupant must be assessed as part of the certification requirements for aircraft seats. A different trajectory and head contact velocity will likely produce different impact acceleration and HIC results. Figure 14. Comparison of Head Velocity Lap belt horizontal tests Figure 1 5. Comparison of Head Velocity 4-point restraints - horizontal tests 374</page><page sequence="9">The relative differences in head velocity data from the 4-point restraint tests shown in Figure 15 appear to be greater than lap-belt-only head velocities. However, dif- ferences at lower magnitudes of head velocities (&lt;20 ft/ sec) from 4-point restraint tests, shown in Figure 14, are not as important as the similarity noted on the lap-belt- only data in which the head velocities were much higher (&gt;50 f/s). This postulate is supported by head impact research data (9) that concludes the results from low velocity impacts (&lt; 22 f/s) pass the HIC criteria with reg- ularity. Whereas, HIC results from high velocity impacts (&gt;40 f/s) generally exceed the limit mandated in the regu- lations unless energy absorbing mechanisms are incor- porated on the contact structure. Therefore, similarity of head kinematics from the higher velocity lap-belt-only tests is more critical than the lower velocity 4-point restraint tests. OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS Three issues must be acknowledged regarding the results described in this project. First, neither the Hybrid II nor Hybrid III was developed to mimic the biomechani- cal responses of a human being exposed to vertical impact forces. Both were designed primarily for automo- tive frontal impact conditions. Features such as seated posture and stiffness of the lumbar and neck segments were developed to represent a person seated in an auto- mobile. FAA's requirement to limit the 1500 lbs. peak lumbar Fz was derived by correlating the lumbar Fz response from a Hybrid II with the military's Dynamic Response Index (10), which is based on a mechanical analog model of the human spine. The DRI is calculated from the seat pan vertical acceleration. The FAA requirement was selected as a more practical means of assessing spinal load protection (4) for civil aircraft seats. The emphasis on lumbar force measurements in this project was based on "equivalence" to responses from the Hybrid II, which was the ATD used to establish the lumbar load criteria in the FAA's regulations. Thus, no inference should be made that biofidelity of the lumbar spine was assessed in this project. A second issue, which was not addressed in these tests, is comparability of head impact responses. Most con- spicuous was a comparison of HIC results. The differ- ences in the head and neck components of the Hybrid II and Hybrid III have been shown to produce different head acceleration responses and HIC results (1 1 ). Neither the Hybrid II nor the Hybrid III are recognized to exhibit a high degree of biofidelity in head-neck response (12,13). However, the evolutionary changes made to the Hybrid III head-neck design were considered improvements over the Hybrid II. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that HIC results from a Hybrid III are as acceptable as HIC results from a Hybrid II. This is the policy in automotive regula- tions. The third point that must be recognized is that these tests were performed with a rigid seat fixture. Restraint anchor reactions and upper torso restraint loads were signifi- cantly higher than would be expected from tests with actual aircraft seats. Likewise, head kinematics would be affected by factors not assessed with the rigid seat. These factors include cushion stiffness, restraint geome- try, and seat deformation. CONCLUSIONS - The results of the tests conducted in this project indicate that differences between the stan- dard Hybrid II and Hybrid III ATDs affect responses that are important in the compliance with FAA regulations for certifying aircraft seats. Comparisons of standard Hybrid III and Hybrid II lumbar Fz forces, lap belt anchor forces, and head kinematics demonstrate that the physical differ- ences between the ATDs produce results that cannot be considered equivalent for the purpose of aircraft seat cer- tification. The proposed modifications to a standard Hybrid III, pre- sented above, produced results that were more charac- teristic of those acquired with a Hybrid II. Four of the modifications (lumbar column, abdominal insert, upper leg segments, and chest flesh jacket) involve installation of standard parts from the Hybrid II. Only one unique part, the upper lumbar-to-thorax adapter, was developed for this proposed modification. The lumbar load cell instrumentation is a commercially available device com- monly used by dynamic test laboratories. Differences in the head velocity derived from photometric analysis of tests with the three ATDs were noted in this report. In the lap-belt-only horizontal tests, which pro- duced the highest head velocities, the FAA Hybrid III head velocity data was slightly higher than the head velocity of the Hybrid II. However, as a device to be used for certification purposes, the slightly higher head velocity of the FAA Hybrid III may be considered as a conserva- tive method of assessing head kinematics. The proposed FAA Hybrid III ATD developed in this project addressed the concerns for equivalency with the standard Hybrid II. Based on the information presented herein, a recommendation to allow the use of this ATD can be made to the FAA authorities with the responsibility for issuing and enforcing seat certification policies. 375</page><page sequence="10">REFERENCES 1.
