<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MUCIANtJS RHIANNON ASH Vespasian's éminence grise, Gaius Licinius Mucianus, was without doubt an extraordinary man, whose colourful world interacts with that of Pliny the Elder in both literary and political terms. Mucianus is perhaps best known for the invaluable practical assistance which he offered to Vespasian during his turbulent rise to power, but he was also a writer of some stature. Where Pliny wrote his monumental Historia Naturalis , Mucianus produced a book of Mirabilia ,* on an unknown scale, which Pliny used repeatedly as a source.2 The main purpose of this discussion will be to extrapolate from the surviving fragments what sort of work this was, but in addition, consideration of the fragmentary Mirabilia will also shed some light on the relationship that existed between Mucianus and Pliny the Elder, two giants of the new Flavian regime.3 i This title is used for convenience, but it is not cited by Pliny the Elder.

Where Pliny proved himself a solid supporter of the new emperor Vespasian, maximus omnis aeui rector ('the greatest ruler of all time', //N 2.18), Mucianus was the man whose intervention helped to put the princeps in power in the first place. Before the Flavians exploded onto the scene, both Pliny and Mucianus were respectably active in the military sphere. Pliny served three times in Germany, once in 47 with Corbulo, a general with whom Mucianus may also have served in Armenia,4 once in 50 and again in 57-58, when he got to know Titus, the dedicatee of the Historia Naturalis.5 Mucianus too is supposed to have had a good relationship with Titus, who succeeded in ironing out the initial tensions in the relationship between Mucianus and Vespasian.6 Tacitus calls the jovial Titus natura atque arte compositus adliciendis etiam Muciani moribus ('inclined by nature and by training also to win the compliance of Mucianus', Hist. 2.5.2). Pliny was actively involved in the business of government, as is clear from a fragment of Suetonius, who refers to Pliny's procurationes splendidissimae et continuae , although unfortunately the details cannot be substantiated beyond the fact that Pliny served as procurator in Spain.7 Mucianus served as legate, first of Lycia-Pamphylia and then of Syria, from where he supported Vespasian's bid for power. Although Antonius Primus ultimately stole Mucianus' thunder in the military sphere, Mucianus certainly had bright moments, including staving off trouble in Dacia, where problems erupted while imperial attention was distracted by the civil wars.8 Tacitus gives Mucianus credit (grudgingly perhaps) as an agent of fortune for averting disaster: adfuit, ut saepe alias , fortuna populi Romani , quae Mucianum uiresque Orientis illuc tulit, et quod Cremonae interim transegimus ('As so spring on Andros again), 31.19 (spring of Cyzicus/love), 32.62 (oysters of Cyzicus), 34.36 (statues at Rhodes), 35.164 (Vitellius' cooking), 36.131 (sarcophagus stone), 36.134 (stones which create other stones). 4 See B. Levick, Vespasian (London 1999) 53, citing as evidence Pliny HN 5.83 on the sources of the Euphrates (with R. Syme, Tacitus (Oxford 1958) 790). B. Baldwin, 'Pliny the Elder and Mucianus', Emerita 43 (1995) 291-301 (292 n.4) stresses that Mucianus' service with Corbulo is only a possibility. 5 See R. Syme, 'Pliny the Procurator', Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 73 (1969) 201-36 = Roman papers II, ed. E. Badian (Oxford 1979) 742-73, and M. Beagon, Roman nature (n.l, above) 2. 6 Levick, Vespasian (n.4, above) 25 suggests that the initial hostility between Mucianus and Vespasian may have been connected with the death of Corbulo. Vespasian's prominence in the Judaean campaign was brought about partly because Corbulo was no longer alive, and Mucianus, as a former adherent of Corbulo, resented this. B. W. Jones, The emperor Titus (London, Sydney and New York 1984) 87-100 contests the theory of subsequent rivalry between Titus and Mucianus. 7 The fragment is from Suetonius' de Vins Illustribus (C. L. Roth, C. Suetoni Tranquilli quae supersunt omnia (Leipzig 1875) 300). On Pliny and Suetonius see R. Kaster, C. Suetonius Tranquillus de grammaticis et rhetoribus (Oxford 1995) 344-45. See Beagon, Roman nature (n.l, above) 4 on the procuratorship. Syme, Tacitus (n.4, above) 791 speculates that Mucianus came either from Apennine Italy or from Spain. J. F. Healy, Pliny the Elder on science and technology (Oxford 1999) 1-22 offers a useful overview of Pliny's life. 8 See R. Syme, 'The march of Mucianus', Antichthon 11 (1977) 78-92 = Roman papers III, ed. A. R. Birley (Oxford 1984) 998-1013.</page><page sequence="3">RHIANNON ASH: THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MUCIANUS 3 often, the fortune of the Roman people was on hand and brought Mucianus and the forces of the east on the scene just at the moment when we had settled matters at Cremona', Hist 3.46.3). So Mucianus appears like some deus ex machina to save the day for Rome. Even if, as Syme says, Mucianus was primarily 'a diplomat rather than a soldier'9, he certainly knew what to do in a military crisis. Finally, there is another possible connection between Pliny and Mucianus, namely that Pliny's career under the Flavians was specifically aided through the patronage of Mucianus.10 This possibility makes it particularly intriguing to consider what sort of image of Mucianus and his work Pliny presents in the Historia Naturalis. The Wheel of Fortune Yet, while Pliny's star remained bright, Mucianus' fortunes appear to have plummeted at some point after his final suffect consulship in 72 and his death, usually dated between 74-77. 11 Tacitus highlights Mucianus' central role in Rome during the immediate aftermath of the civil war: initia principatus ac statura urbis Mucianus regebat ('Mucianus was controlling the first stages of the principáte and the situation in Rome', Ag. 7.2). 12 What this meant in practice was that Mucianus, who had been given Vespasian's ring as a sign of authority (D.C. 65.2.2), oversaw executions of prominent men, including Calpurnius Galerianus (Hist. 4.11.2), son of the figurehead of the Pisonian conspiracy in 65, who was discreetly taken 40 miles up the Appian way, where he had his veins opened. At Mucianus' instigation, Vitellius' son was also put to death (Hist. 4.80.1). So, while Vespasian was conveniently lingering in Alexandria, indulging in miracles of healing, which would still be talked about by eye-witnesses years later (Hist 4.81), Mucianus was getting his hands dirty. This also included the difficult task of diminishing the influence of the rogue general Antonius Primus, which he achieved partly by sending away the commander's personal legion to winter quarters (Hist. 4.39). 13 Mucianus was also busy boosting the imperial finances, with a zeal necessitated by Nero's expenditure,14 but this was not popular: Dio says that the stigma of this policy was associated with Mucianus, when it would otherwise have been to Vespasian's 9 See Syme, Tacitus (n.4, above) 598. io See Beagon, Roman nature (n.l, above) 3-4 and Purcell's entry for Pliny the Elder in OCD3. 1 1 See Levick, Vespasian (n.4, above) 194 for the date of Mucianus' death. Tat fuit of Pliny HN 32.62 has been used to suggest that Mucianus was dead by this point: see Baldwin, 'Pliny the Elder and Mucianus' (n.4, above) 300. 12 Mucianus' general prominence in Rome is also suggested by a lead pipe inscribed with his name recently discovered on the Palatine (G. Rizzo, 'La Fistula di C. Licinius Mucianus', in 'Activités de l'École Française', Mélanges de l'École Française de Rome. Antiquité 107 (1995) 459-547 (471-4), F. Villedieu, 'Activités de l'École Française', Mélanges de l'École Française de Rome. Antiquité 108 (1996) 423-501), which W. Eck, ' Domus : C. Licinius Mucianus' in Lexicon Topographicum Urbis Romae V, ed. E. M. Steinby (Rome 1999) 249 suggests carne from a house of Mucianus dating from the aftermath of the fire of Rome in 64 at the earliest. I owe these references to Margareta Steinby. Tacitus refers to Mucianus domos hortosque permutons (Hist. 4.11.1) during his 'interregnum' in Rome. 13 See Levick, Vespasian (n.4, above) 81. 14 On Nero's finances, see M. Griffin, Nero: the end of a dynasty (London 1984) 197-207.</page><page sequence="4">4 VITA VIGILIA EST discredit (D.C. 65.2.5), although a reputation for imperial avarice crept into the tradition soon enough. As if all of this was not enough, Mucianus also had to make arrangements to suppress the rebel Julius Civilis in the north, and even set off himself in the summer of 70 with Domitian to deal with the threat, though it had evaporated before the pair reached the Alps, thanks to the men whom Mucianus had judiciously sent on ahead (Hist. 4.85-86). In fact, Vespasian did not arrive in Rome until late September or early October 70, by which point Mucianus had been holding the fort since almost the beginning of the year. This was an excellent strategy on Vespasian's part, to leave the nasty business of mopping up after the civil war to the competent Mucianus, at the same time as heightening by deferral the excitement at the prospect of his own return to Rome (and the associated triumph).15 Vespasian must have trusted Mucianus absolutely, perhaps partly because this was a man who had no children of his own, with whom to establish a rival imperial dynasty. Mucianus too must have had considerable confidence that Vespasian was going to reward him for his loyal service over this period. Indeed, he was awarded a third suffect consulship in 72, as we are reminded in the Historia Naturalis by Pliny's constant epithet for him, ter consul.16 However, that was the extent of Vespasian's generosity, and we know from Suetonius that Mucianus was complacent and disrespectful towards the new emperor: Licinium Mucianum notae impudicitiae , sed meritorum fiducia minus sui reuerentem , numquam nisi clam et hactenus retaxare sustinuit , ut apud communem aliquem amicum querens adderei clausulam: ego tarnen uir sum ('As for Licinius Mucianus, a notorious homosexual, but a man who was less respectful towards Vespasian through confidence in services rendered, the emperor never could bring himself to censure him in return except privately, and then merely to the extent of adding a little dig when complaining to a mutual friend: "I at least am a man'", Ves. 13)'. Suetonius has cast Vespasian's impatient expression of frustration as a positive illustration of his restraint before an outspoken friend, but Mucianus arguably has a point. He has, after all, killed for Vespasian, brilliantly controlled his problematic son, Domitian, dealt with the rogue general Antonius Primus, made the arrangements for suppressing Civilis' rebellion, and started the unpopular process of restoring the health of the imperial finances, quite apart from his initial move of allowing Vespasian to claim the principáte when he might have had a decent shot at the job himself. Nor was his role of standing in for Vespasian between January and September 70 merely symbolic or a smokescreen. As Griffin points out, 'the voyage from Egypt to Rome would take about 80 days in November to March and about 30 days from April to October'17, so Mucianus would have had to make many difficult decisions without immediate access to reassuring consultation with the new emperor. Levick also draws attention to a detail in Suetonius' story, which is suggestive about the new emperor's malice, in that Vespasian deliberately chose to express his annoyance at Mucianus' dissatisfaction to 15 See J. BJ 7.63-74 for excitement at Vespasian's return to Rome. Levick, Vespasian (n.4, above) 65 speculates that Pliny the Elder perhaps concluded the thirty-one books of his lost Histories on the high point of the Flavian triumph. 16 Mucianus as ter consul (or equivalents): Pliny HN 2.231, 3.59, 8.6, 12.9, 13.88, 14.54, 16.213, 19.12, 28.29, and 34.36. His consulships were 'all suffect, the first in the mid-sixties, the others in 70 and 72' (G. E. F. Chilver, A historical commentary on Tacitus Histories I and II (Oxford 1979) 62). 17 See M. Griffin, 'The Flavians', in The Cambridge ancient history XI , 2nd edn, ed. A. K. Bowman, P. Garnsey, and D. Rathbone (Cambridge 2000) 9 n.29.</page><page sequence="5">RHIANNON ASH: THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MUCIANUS 5 a mutual friend, who was 'bound to report the remark back'.18 At any rate, as Jones summarises, 'in the seventies, he [Mucianus] was pushed aside and seems to have devoted himself to writing, no doubt out of bitterness and frustration'.19 In the final years, the real world of Mucianus was far from wonderful. So where should Mucianus' literary creation, the Mirabilia , be located? Was the Mirabilia , as many scholars think, a product of Mucianus' bitter final years, a form of desperate escapism from the ungrateful Vespasian's principáte?20 Or could the work have been written earlier than the 70s in happier times?21 There are certainly references in the surviving fragments of the Mirabilia to incidents and phenomena connected geographically with Lycia,22 where Mucianus served as legate, a post which Syme suggests that he was holding in C.58.23 So, the work must have been written at some point after 58. It could, for instance, have been a product of Nero's principáte when many writers, including Pliny himself, chose to investigate fairly recondite or escapist topics, as a strategy for keeping out of trouble.24 Even though Pliny's references to Mucianus having been consul three times indicate that he himself was excerpting from the work after the third consulship of 72, this does not necessarily help with the question of when Mucianus originally wrote the Mirabilia . It certainly could have been before 72, with Pliny merely providing the up-to-date label about the number of Mucianus' consulships to reflect the situation after 72. The difficulty in 18 Levick, Vespasian (n. 4, above) 90. 19 B. Jones, Suetonius Vespasian (London 2000) 83. 20 D. Detlefsen, Die Anordnung der geographischen Bücher des Plinius und ihre Quellen (Berlin 1909) 156 suggests 72 or later, A. Klotz, Quaestiones Plinianae geographicae (Berlin 1906) 24 has a date after 73. 1 owe these references to Barbara Levick. H. Peter, Historicorum Romanorum reliquiae , 2nd edn (Leipzig 1906-14) 140-42 supports the idea of composition in the 70s, because Pliny refers twice (HN 14.54 and 19.12) to Mucianus having revealed a piece of information nuperrime. The problem here is that Pliny's other uses of the superlative adverb ( HN1.9 , 14.54, 15.50, 15.69, 19.12, 36.145 and 37.37) have quite a wide frame of reference, including the detail that tribes beyond the Alps engaged in human sacrifice nuperrime , which presumably does not refer to the last 5 years (HN 7.9). 21 E. Oden, 'Ein angebliches Bruchstück Democrits über die Entdeckung unterirdischer Quellen', Philologus Supplementebande 1 (1899) 230-384 (292 n.84) suggests a date of 62-63. I owe this reference to Barbara Levick. 22 Mucianus refers to Lycia (Pliny HN 12.9, 13.88, and 21.33), to the island of Andros (HN 2.23 1 and 31.16), to the Pomptine Marshes (HN 3.59), to Delos (HN 4.66), to Syros (HN 4.67), to the circumference of the Black Sea (HN 4.77), to the Lake of Moeris (HN 5.50), to the source of the Euphrates (HN 5.83), to Arados (ZflV 5.128), to Rhodes (HN 5.132 and 34.36), to Argos (HN136), to Mount Tmolus (HN 1.159), to Puteoli (HN 8.6), to the Iasian gulf (HN 9.33), to the Red Sea ( HN9.6S ), to Propontis (HN 9.94), to Maronea (HN 14.54), to Ephesus (HN 16.213), to Lindus on Rhodes (HN 19.12), to Cyzicus (HN 31.19 and 32.62), and to Assos on the Troad (HN 36.134). 23 See R. Syme, Tamphylia from Augustus to Vespasian', Klio 30 (1937) 227-31 (229) = Roman papers I, ed. E. Badian (Oxford 1979) 42-6 (43), and B. Levick, Roman colonies in southern Asia Minor (Oxford 1967) 227-28. 24 Beagon, Roman nature (n.l, above) 3 observes: 'In the final years of Nero's reign, "when the slavery of the times made it dangerous to write anything at all independent or inspired" (Ep. 3.5.3), he [Pliny the Elder] produced a six- volume work on the education of an orator and an eight- volume grammatical treatise'.</page><page sequence="6">6 VITA VIGILIA EST answering this question is compounded by the fact that we do not know either the scale of the Mirabilia (i.e. how long it might have taken him to write it) or the precise date of Mucianus' death. If the work was a product of an enforced withdrawal from public life after 72, Mucianus would have needed to have been industrious in order to publish it in time for Pliny to incorporate it in his Historia Naturalis. Yet this is certainly not impossible, particularly given the extraordinary efficiency with which Pliny worked. An additional complication is that Mucianus wrote other works, of which we need to take account: Tacitus in the Dialogus refers to Mucianus' ongoing collation of various Republican speeches and documents, including those of Pompey and Crassus, in the form of eleven Libri Actorum and three books of Epistulae , which (from the viewpoint of the speaker Maternus) have already been published, with the implication being that there are further volumes in the pipeline (Dial. 37.2). Since the dramatic date of the Dialogus is 7525 and Tacitus describes Mucianus' collation with a verb in the present tense ( cum maxime a Mudano contrahuntur. Dial. 37.2), it seems that Mucianus was working on projects other than (or in addition to) the Mirabilia in the final years of his life. Perhaps ultimately the question of when Mucianus wrote the Mirabilia is insoluble, but it is worth raising at the start, partly because of what it could tell us about Pliny the Elder. Depending on whether we prefer a later or an earlier date of composition, Pliny is either stubbornly incorporating a hot-off-the-press work written by an out-of-favour adherent of Vespasian, or he is cautiously bringing back into the public eye a less recent composition, written in happier days by his patron Mucianus, who has now been pushed out of the limelight. A more detailed examination of the fragments themselves may help us to decide between these two possibilities. In conducting this analysis, we will need to bear in mind Brunt's provisos about studies of fragments and epitomes,26 namely, that the criteria of selection by the secondary author reflect his concerns and interests, rather than offering a balanced indication of the nature of the original work, and that the wording or emphasis of the fragments themselves may well have been warped by the author who was doing the excerpting.27 Sumptuous wonders An especially striking feature of Mucianus' work is the importance regularly attached to the ability to see the world around him with his own eyes. Pliny the Elder ( HN 28.29) offers an intriguing anecdote in this context. One of Mucianus' more whimsical habits involved tying a white linen bag around his neck, which contained a living fly, to help ward off opthalmia. In practical terms, ophthalmia could present serious practical problems for a writer, as is clear from Cicero, who claims to have produced a much shorter letter than usual: dictaui propter 25 See R. Mayer, Tacitus dialogus de oratoribus (Cambridge 2001) 16, explaining that the dramatic date of 75 depends on the interpretation of Dialogus 17.3 sextam iamfelicis huius principatus stationem qua Vespasianus rem publicam fouet. 26 See P. A. Brunt, 'On historical fragments and epitomes', CQ 30 (1980) 477-94. 27 The only verbatim fragment of Mucianus in Pliny (HN 32.62), as opposed to a paraphrase, illustrates some of the difficulties. Scholars have debated where precisely the quotation ends and where Pliny takes up again his role as narrator.</page><page sequence="7">RHIANNON ASH: THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MUCIANUS 7 lippitudinem , ('I dictated it because of ophthalmia', Att. 7. 13a.3).28 Yet the talisman of the fly points to a broader significance of sight for Mucianus' literary world. In many fragments of the Mirabilia Mucianus lays great emphasis on the importance of autopsy in describing the various marvels, which may explain why ophthalmia held special terrors for him.29 If through disease he could not see the marvels with his own eyes, then his access to them - and his personal auctoritas as a writer of marvels - would be compromised.30 Another general (but related) characteristic of the work is that most of the fragments are ahistorical: it is Mucianus' presence as a witness in a particular place at a particular time which lends meaning and gives access to the various marvels. As Clarke has recently observed in a discussion of geography, history and focalization, The ideas of time and space as "experienced" rather than abstract entities, and as subject to "perception" from one or more viewpoints, immediately give importance to human actors, viewers and narrators'.31 Mucianus' status as an eye-witness in the Mirabilia is a case in point. So what sort of world does Mucianus create in his Mirabilia ? There are certainly different ways in which one could organise the surviving fragments, but some Mucianic tendencies transcend such cataloguing.32 One important characteristic is Mucianus' habit of giving measurements of the natural and man-made worlds: so, he gives the circumference of the island Syros as 160 miles {HN 4.67), the circumference of the Black Sea as 2425 miles (HN 4 .77), the 28 On eye-diseases in the ancient world, see R. Jackson, Doctors and diseases in the Roman empire (London 1988) 82-85 and 121-23: 'Recipes for eye ointments comprise a distinct and substantial part of ancient pharmacopoeias, and there is no doubt that eye diseases were among the most common afflictions of the time' (82). 29 Mucianus and autopsy: ex iis qui proxime uiderant (HN 5.83), uisum a se . . . Arescontem and puerum a se uisum (7.36), se uidente (8.6), sollertiam eius animalis Mucianus uisam sibi prodidit (8.201), uisam sibi (9.94), uisum a se (1 1.167), praesens in eo tractu (14.54), proxime uiso (16.213).

Grmek, Diseases in the ancient Greek world (Baltimore and London 1991) 26 on the paradox of the blind bard: 'Ancient Writers were not unaware of the contradiction between a tradition that wished the bard to be blind and the fact that visual experience of the world is necessary to describe it well in poetry'. 31 See K. Clarke, Between geography and history : Hellenistic constructions of the Roman world (Oxford 1999) 22. 32 Mucianus' Mirabilia arranged by categories: (a) Geographical details: HN 3.59 (Pomptine marshes), 4.66 (earthquakes on Delos), 4.67 (circumference of Syros), 4.77 (circumference of Black Sea), 5.50 (lake of Moeris), 5.83 (source of Euphrates), 5.128 (fresh-water spring at bottom of sea), and 5.132 (distance of Rhodes from Egypt), (b) Stories about humans: 7.36 (women becoming men; cf.

Mucianus clearly liked to codify and to measure out the world of his narrative in absolute or relative terms, perhaps as a way of creating a reassuring and plausible veneer of factual knowledge, to which he could then anchor the marvellous stories.33 Rihll comments on the power of numbers: 'For us, numbers seem to lend an aura of objectivity, solidity and reliability which mere opinion lacks'.34 This would also have been true for ancient readers. Mucianus' rigorous citation of numbers probably had more to do with establishing his auctoritas as an author than with accurately measuring the world around him, particularly since his figures tend to be on the high side.35 The need to measure out the world mathematically should be seen to have an ulterior literary motive.36 A related point is that Mucianus also habitually roots his marvels in particular geographical locations. So, he says that there is an extraordinarily long life expectancy of 150 years for those living on the peak of Mount Tmolus in Asia Minor (HN 7. 159).37 Or, when Mucianus describes the bizarre case of Argis Arescontem, cui nomen Arescusae fuis set, nupsisse etiam, mox barbam et uirilitatem prouenisse uxoremque duxisse ('at Argos a man Arescon, whose name had been Arescusa, who had actually married a husband, but then had grown a beard and developed masculine attributes and taken a wife', HN136 ), he explicitly locates the incident in Argos.38 The identification of the location in such cases is surely designed to enhance verisimilitude and to imply that readers could travel to Mount Tmolus or to Argos to corroborate the phenomenon in person. This organisational technique harks back to the founder of the paradoxographical tradition, Callimachus, who is credited in the Suda with a work called ůaujnáTcov tôv eiç änaoav Tfļv yfļv Konrà tótuouç övtcov auvaycoyn (A Collection of Wonders from the Whole Earth Arranged by Locality).39 We might also compare examples 33 W. Hansen, Phlegon ofTralles. Book of marvels (Exeter 1996) 9 calls paradoxography 'entertaining reading with a flavour of learning'. 34 T. E. Rihll, Greek science. Greece and Rome new surveys in the Classics 29 (Oxford 1999) 10. 35 Baldwin, 'Pliny the Elder and Mucianus' (n.4, above) 295 observes: 'Mucianus óctuples the dimensions of the island of Syros from those given by unspecified ancient writers'. 36 One could see a parallel in Tacitus' tendency to name even minor figures wherever possible to add credibility and authority to his narrative voice. A. J. Woodman, 'Nero's alien capital: Tacitus as paradoxographer (Annals 15.36-7)', in Author and audience in Latin literature , ed. T. Woodman and J. Powell (Cambridge 1992) 173-88 (186) = A. J. Woodman, Tacitus Reviewed (Oxford 1999) 168-89 (186), discussing the naming of Pythagoras at Ann. 15.37.4, observes: 'The primary function of the reference is to guarantee the genuineness of an incident which otherwise seems beyond belief; but this in turn implies the privileged stance of the paradoxographer, who has specialised knowledge and for whom naming is an activity which characterises his role'. 37 See M. Beagon, The Elder Pliny on the human animal: Natural History book seven (Oxford 2005) 365. 38 See Beagon, The Elder Pliny on the human animal (n.37, above) 175-76. 39 See Detlefsen, Die Anordnung (n.20, above) 157.</page><page sequence="9">RHIANNON ASH: THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MUCIANUS 9 from more serious genres, such as Polybius' careful arrangement of his material according to geography, with a fixed progression from west to east.40 The limits of the geographical locations in the fragments of Mucianus' Mirabilia can be plotted. The furthest points mentioned to the west are the Pomptine marshes (HN 3.59) and Puteoli ( HN 8.6), while the furthest point to the east is the source of the Euphrates (HN 5.83). The most distant point to the north is the circumference of the Black Sea (HN 4.11), and to the south, the Red Sea (HN 9.68). Most of the stories cluster around the Aegean islands, Asia Minor and the province of Lycia and Pamphylia itself. This is understandable, given that Mucianus must have conducted his research for the Mirabilia during his time as legate, but the emphasis on the east does suggest where the centre of gravity lay for the Mirabilia , provided that Pliny's excerpts are reasonably representative. As Clarke has observed in a discussion of geography: The climatologically privileged temperate zone is a movable feature, shifted by the writers of Strabo's time from Ionia to the centre of power in Italy...'.41 Mucianus' shift back eastwards not only reflects the literary tradition of paradoxography, according to which marvels naturally occurred in the east (or in Egypt), but also mirrors a growing political and military interest in the east during the principates of Nero and Vespasian. Although the specification of geographical locations is meant to add a plausible veneer of reality to the fragments, the human sphere depicted in them is marked by an engaging degree of whimsicality and fantasy. The excerpts suggest an idealised domain of experience for mankind, which triggers feelings of optimism and excitement in a reader. This is the sort of world where normal boundaries and limitations can be broken: so, a woman can become a man (HN 7.36), and be happily married in both states,42 you can live until you are 150 (HN 7. 159) and sprout new teeth at the age of 104 (HN 1 1 .167), you can ward off ophthalmia, just by wearing a living fly around your neck (HN 28.29), and it is possible deponere amorem ('to lay aside love', HN 31.19) just by drinking from Cupid's spring at Cyzicus. In this last example, Mucianus gives added impact by elegantly evoking a famous line from Catullus: difficile est longum subito deponere amorem (ťIt is hard to lay aside a long love suddenly', 76.13). The allusion playfully sets Catullus' anguished efforts to lay aside his love against the simple convenience of a sip of water.43 This is even the sort of world where the legal system works and justice gets done. So, Mucianus tells a tale of intrigue in the fishing industry (HN 9.182), where one partner in a lucrative business maliciously catches and sells from a shoal of anthias fish the so-called 'decoy fish', whose main value lies in unwittingly luring its unsuspecting friends into the clutches of the fishermen. The wronged associate miraculously recognises the 'decoy fish', presumably from amongst dozens on the slab in the market, initiates legal proceedings and wins compensation. Practical considerations, such as how the plaintiff managed to persuade the court that the fish in the market was actually the 'decoy 40 See Clarke, Between geography and history (n.31, above) 77-128. 41 Clarke, Between geography and history (n.31, above) 298. 42 Sex-changers were also a distinct category of Phlegon of Tralles' Book of Marvels.

'Now there is in Lycia a famous plane-tree, with the associated pleasure of an icy spring. It stands beside the road like a dwelling-place, containing a hollow cavern 8 1 feet across, with its shady peak, and protects itself with enormous branches, which are as big as trees, and covers the fields with long shadows. So that nothing should be lacking from its resemblance to a grotto, it embraces inside it mossy pumice-stones in a circular ledge of rock. It is so deserving of wonder that Licinius Mucianus, who was consul 3 times and recently legate of the province, thought that it was worth handing down even to posterity that he, together with eighteen companions, held a banquet within the tree, which itself generously provided couches of leaves, and that in the same tree, safe from every gust of wind, with the patter of rain through the leaves delighting him more than gleaming marble, the diversity of painting or golden panelling, he had fallen asleep'. Nature is here represented as generous and co-operative, evolving in this particular location as if she understands precisely which features will present most pleasure for human consumers. The hollow plane tree itself offers the associated pleasure of an icy spring, to complete the delights of a classic locus amoenus ,46 and provides by means of its huge branches the requisite shade, extending over an enormous area. On the inside, in order to resemble a grotto,47 the tree provides mossy ledges of rock and generously contributes couches of leaves. The details of the banquet itself have not been given, perhaps so as not to detract from the air of natural simplicity afforded by the location itself, or possibly through Pliny's judicious editing of Mucianus' original passage. Instead, the unpretentious pleasure provided by the patter of rain, which 44 Baldwin, Tliny the Elder and Mucianus' (n.4, above) 298 wonders 'if the case had fallen under the latter's [Mucianus'] own jurisdiction'. 45 See further Beagon, Roman nature (n.l, above) 82. 46 Cf.

Mucianus is generally represented as being an extravagant and hedonistic man. So Tacitus in his two-part character-sketch highlights Mucianus' enthusiasm for nimiae uoluptates in his leisure-time (Hist. 1.10.2), and observes how his magnificentia et opes marked him out (Hist. 2.5.2). Even Pliny himself, in the epicurean context of oysters, calls Mucianus, now safely dead, lingua . . . peritissima huius censurae in nostro aeuo ('the most skilful connoisseur of such matters in our time', HN 32.62). This man resembled a pleasure-seeking Maecenas figure, rather than an Agrippa.48 Nor did Mucianus bother to hide his enjoyment of the good things in life in other fragments of the Mirabilia. His eloquent appreciation of the delights of Maronean wine, colore nigrum , odoratum , uetustate pinguescere ('black in colour, fragrant and becoming rich as it ages', HN 14.54), is a case in point. If Mucianus was writing his Mirabilia after being pushed out of the political limelight after 72, then this emphasis on the hedonistic delights of eating and drinking was at odds with the austere ethos of the new principáte. Indeed, Tacitus famously characterises Vespasian as a praecipuus adstńcti moris auctor ('particular advocate of strict morals', Ann. 3.55.4)49, for whom Mucianus was prepared to risk charges of hypocrisy during his second consulship in 70 by denouncing Vitellius for his 'swamp-like dishes' (HN 35. 164). Yet there was little point in Mucianus holding himself back, once he had fallen out of favour. Of course, if Mucianus wrote the Mirabilia under Nero's principáte, then to represent himself as a hedonist would have been to cohere with the spirit of the times. Suetonius, whether accurately or not, attributes the following saying to Nero: sordidos ac deparcos esse quibus impensarum ratio constarei, praelautos uereque magníficos qui abuterentur ac perderent ('All those who can provide an account of expenditure are miserly and stingy: men who are really elegant and truly magnificent squander and throw away their money', Nero 30. 1). So much for the idealised human sphere. What about the animals and fish, which make up another important category of fragments? As we will see, although the three stories about land- animals are particularly memorable, Mucianus clearly has a special fascination with creatures from the sea. This perhaps is a natural reflection of the geographical location and physical resources of his province Lycia-Pamphylia, the latter being particularly rich in harbours, but it could also have a culinary twist to it: Mucianus loved seafood. At any rate, Mucianus' depiction of the land-animals shows creatures who regularly display anthropomorphic qualities, but in a way which appropriately reflects the idealised human sphere that has already been outlined. First, there is the ape, clever enough to play latrunculi , a battle-game played on a board divided into squares, and quick to distinguish at a glance imitation nuts made of wax (HN 8.215). This fragment smacks of Mucianic humour, through the conceit of an ape, an animal whose name was used to refer to someone who imitates another,50 being represented as 48 Sexuality (Tac. Ann. 1.54.2) and indulgence of luxuries (Pliny HN 8.170) are the obvious points of contact between Maecenas and Mucianus. 49 See A. J. Woodman and R. H. Martin, The Annals of Tacitus book 3 (Cambridge 1996) 406. 50 See OLD s.v. simia 2, citing Plin. Ep. 1.5.2 on Arulenus Rusticus as the Stoicorum simia. Mucianus himself denounced the Stoics before Vespasian as sham philosophers, although he does not specifically refer to them as apes (D.C. 65.13.1).</page><page sequence="12">12 VITA VIGILIA EST himself so easily able to detect imitations.51 Second, there is the pair of cunning she-goats, who meet on a very narrow bridge above a raging torrent and find themselves stuck, but work out a scheme where one lies down so that the other can climb over (HN 8.201). By co-operating in an exemplary manner, the she-goats manage to extricate themselves from a difficult and dangerous situation: solle rtia is the characteristic, which is said to link the ape and the she- goats.52 This scenario has something in common with the third example, the elephants at Puteoli who are frightened to disembark from a ship, but who overcome the problem by turning around and going backwards, so as to fool themselves about the distance involved (HN 8.6).53 These elephants, like the goats, are practical creatures, who apply their natural intelligence to a problem and find a solution without human intervention, even though their dilemma (i.e. how best to disembark from a boat) is entirely man-made. In fact, these animals generally seem to be rather cleverer than their human counterparts, even managing to beat them in their own sphere. So, Mucianus records that one elephant actually learned Greek and used to write out, presumably with its trunk: ipse ego haec scrìpsi et spolia Celtica dicaui (T myself wrote these things and have dedicated spoils from the Celts', HN 8.6). This elephant's writing is a rather more impressive feat than, for example, when Ovid's Io, transformed into a heifer, wrote her comparatively short name in the dust with her hoof (Met. 1.649). In any case, Io, unlike the elephant, had learned to write when she was in human form. Moreover, the elephant has been taught to engage in elegant play with traditional triumphal inscriptions set up by victorious generals after a successful campaign.54 One could compare Tydeus' words as he dedicates spoils to Pallas after a successful battle: nunc tibifracta uirum spolia informisque dicamus / exuuias (ťNow I dedicate to you shattered spoils of men and shapeless trophies', Stat. Theb. 2.725-26). Even so, Mucianus' elephant is rather a one-trick pony: it can write, but the formulation solitum perscrìbere ('accustomed to write out') suggests that it could only manage this one sentence.55 Compare this with the elephants described by Aelian: Ptolemy II allegedly owned an elephant who could understand Greek (NA 1 1.25), and there is also a reference to another elephant who could understand the Indian language (NA 1 1.14). Plutarch also draws attention to the natural intelligence of elephants in an engaging piece probably written during the 70s and preserved in the Moralia (959A-985; see 968C-E and 972B-C for 51 Apes are elsewhere linked with stories of truth and falsehood. The fabulist Phaedrus used the story of the tyrannical king of the apes to illustrate the maxim that nothing is more profitable for a man than to speak the truth, even if it leads to his destruction. In the fable itself, it is not clear whether the ape- king himself can really distinguish between truth and lies: he probably can, but the point of the story is that as an autocrat, the ape-king gets to dictate what is true (4.13). On this story see J. Henderson, Telling tales on Caesar: Roman stories from Phaedrus (Oxford 2001) 177-80. 52 Ael. NA 7.26 also discusses the cleverness of goats. 53 For more on elephants see H. H. Scullard, The elephant in the Greek and Roman world (London 1974). 54 See further S. P. Oakley, A commentary on Livy books VI-X : Volume I (Cambridge 1997) 422-23 with M. Vegisonius Marcellus dicauit (CIL XIII.4317) and coronas . . . dicauit imperator Vespasianus Augustus (Pliny HN 12.94). 55 For another clever elephant, see Mart. Sp. 17, where the elephant is said to supplicate itself before Titus nullo . . . docente magistro.</page><page sequence="13">RHIANNON ASH: THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MUCI ANUS 1 3 the elephants), debating whether land or sea animals are cleverer. The outcome of that debate is that each group is as clever as the other. At any rate, what all of Mucianus' land-animals have in common is that they are clever, rational creatures, who have to use their own resources to get out of trouble.56 The endowment of members of the animal kingdom with human characteristics continues when Mucianus moves on to sea-creatures. So, he describes sociable dolphins in the Iasian gulf, who assist fishermen, so that each boat has its own socius ('ally', HN 9.33) from the dolphin community. The motivation for the dolphins is that they are paid wages in the form of fish as a reward. Of course, ever since Herodotus' story of Arion, ancient writers have anthropomorphised dolphins, but Mucianus extends this even to small shellfish. So he tells a story about the murex , a kind of bivalve: on one occasion, large numbers of múrices cling to the sides of a ship bringing orders from Periander, tyrant of Corinth, that some noble boys are to be castrated, and the ship grinds to a halt, despite a strong wind. As a result, the boys are saved and shell-fish are worshipped at the temple of Venus on Cnidus (HN 9.80).57 This story suggests (however implausibly) that the shell-fish know what is happening and intervene to save the boys, although it could also be read as an illustration of human naivety for being prepared to worship such a creature. A less ambiguous case of anthropomorphising on the high-seas can be found in Mucianus' description of the nauplius , a playful creature which resembles a cuttlefish (HN 9.94). When the nauplius comes across a particular type of shell- fish, which has a shell conveniently shaped like a small boat, it jumps on board, ludendi societate sola ('only by way of sharing a game', HN 9. 9 A), as Mucianus says. The carrier-shell then rows or sails, depending on whether there is a breeze. Mucianus continues: huius uoluptatem esse utferat, illius ut regat, simulque earn descendere in duo sensu carenila, nisi forte - tristi id enim constat omini nauigantium - humana calamitas in causa est. ('One creature's pleasure is to carry, that of the other is to steer, and at the same time that pleasure penetrates two creatures which lack the capacity for perception, unless perhaps - for it is generally agreed that this is a gloomy omen for seafarers - human calamity is the reason', HN 9.94). Mucianus here ends by drawing attention to the paradoxical idea that these simple creatures can experience uoluptas from such games, but Pliny as narrator offers a more pessimistic interpretation of the colourful anecdote, by suggesting in the protasis that the games are triggered by trouble in the human sphere. Mucianic simplicity is thus over-ridden by darker Plinian tones. Just because Mucianus at times invests his sea-creatures with human characteristics, that does not stop him enjoying them as food. The last substantial excerpt from this category is unusual because Pliny has actually quoted Mucianus directly: Cyzicena maiora Lucrinis, dulciora Britannicis, suauiora Medullis, acrìora Ephesis, pleniora Iliciensibus, sicciora Coryphantenis, teneriora Histricis, candidiora Cerceiensibus. sed his neque dulciora neque teneriora ulla esse compertum est ('Oysters of Cyzicus are larger than those of Lake Lucrinus, 56 On the more usual motif of absence of reason in animals, see G. Clark, 'Animal passions', Greece &amp; Rome Al (2000) 88-93. 57 We know from Herodotus (3.49) that the boys were from Corcyra and were being sent to Lydia, so if the múrices stopped the ship only near Cnidus, the young Corcyreans must have been getting worried.</page><page sequence="14">14 VITA VIGILIA EST fresher than the British, sweeter than those of the Medulli, sharper than the Ephesian, fuller than those of Ilici, less sloppy than those of Coryphas, more tender than those of Istria, paler than those of Circeii. It has been established, however, that none are fresher or more tender than these', HN 32.62). Over the years, the gourmand Mucianus has clearly become quite an expert on such delicacies, rather like Juvenal's Montanus, who can identify at first bite the provenance of an oyster (4.140-42). Mucianus' effusive string of comparatives in asyndeton cumulatively and vividly bring out the characteristic flavours of these excellent oysters from Cyzicus.58 Yet given that connoisseurship of oysters can be a subject for satire, it is possible that Mucianus' hyperbolic tone self-consciously pokes fun at himself via an elegant literary game. The passage which comes to mind is Ovid's engaging version of the lumbering Polyphemus' inept love-song to the petite nymph, Galatea. Polyphemus attempts to impress his potential girlfriend by comparing her with various splendours of nature using a string of comparative adjectives (Met. 13.789-97): candidior folio niuei, Galatea , ligustri , floridior pratis , longa procerior alno , splendidior uitro, tenero lasciuior haedo , leuior adsiduo detritis aequore conchis , solibus hibernis, aestiua gratior umbra , nobilior pomis, platano conspectior alta, lucidior glacie, matura dulcior uua, mollior et cygni plumis et lacte coacto, et, si non fugias, riguo formosior horto 'Galatea, paler than the petal of the snowy privet, more flowery than the meadows, loftier than the tall alder, more radiant than glass, more playful than the tender kid, smoother than the shells constantly polished by the sea, more pleasing than the winter sun or the summer shade, more excellent than apples, more striking than the lofty plane, more sparkling than ice, sweeter than a ripe grape, softer than swan-feathers and than curds, and if you don't flee from me, more beautiful than a well-watered garden ...'. In characterising Polyphemus, Ovid uses the same relentless asyndeton of comparative adjectives as Mucianus does in eulogising his oysters. At the same time, there is humour in dissonance, where the two models part company. So Mucianus, the elegant epicure, takes on the role of the hairy monster Polyphemus, while the graceful Galatea is replaced by oysters 58 Oysters can bring out vivid powers of description. J. Mitchell, The bottom of the harbour (London 2001) 57-58, in a piece by the same name originally published in the New Yorker in 1951, recalls the words of a doctor, whose father and grandfather worked on the oyster beds in New York: '"Every time I eat harbour oysters", he said, "my childhood comes floating up from the bottom of my mind". He reflected for a few moments. "They have a high iodine content," he continued, "and they have a characteristic taste. When I was a boy in Prince's bay, the old bedders used to say that they tasted like almonds. Since the water went bad, that taste has become more pronounced. It's become coppery and bitter. If you've ever tasted the little nut that's inside the pit of a peach, the kernel, that's how they taste'".</page><page sequence="15">RHIANNON ASH: THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MUCIANUS 15 from Cyzicus.59 Also, where Polyphemus' love-song memorably fails, Mucianus' lyrical and appreciative catalogue of oysters from around the globe indicates his successful consumption of them. This unique verbatim passage, arguably Mucianus' frivolous love song to his favourite oysters, should be seen as particularly revealing about his literary persona. We have already seen how playful Mucianus can be with Catullus, and Tacitus certainly accentuates his eloquence and ostentatiousness when addressing the crowd in the theatre at Antioch: ... satis decorus etiam Graeca facundia, omniumque quae diceretatque ageretarte quadam ostentator ('... he was a sufficiently elegant speaker even in Greek, and had the knack of being able to display to advantage whatever he used to say or do', Hist. 2.80.2). Mucianus' impish and sophisticated personality could well have been attracted by a stylish Ovidian allusion of this sort. In his life and in his writing, he seems to have been an erudite, literate, and polyglot man. There is one final category to consider from Mucianus' lost Mirabilia , namely inanimate objects. This is a much smaller grouping of fragments than the previous two, but one which is nevertheless revealing about Mucianus' concerns. He was certainly a man who had antiquarian interests and who used his time as legate to broaden his knowledge in this sphere. So, we know for example that he visited a certain temple, whose location is not given, but was probably at Xanthus,60 to read an ancient letter of Sarpedon, written from Troy (HN 13.88). Since Sarpedon was commander of the Lycian contingent of Priam's allies (II. 2.876), this visit may well have had a political or a diplomatic edge to it. Since the hero-cult of Sarpedon in Lycia was very ancient, Mucianus, as the new legate, was showing a pleasing degree of cultural sensitivity by trying to inform himself about the local hero. Other instances, however, suggest that Mucianus' antiquarian interests were not just driven by short-term political expediency. Pliny also preserves Mucianus' description of the statue of Diana at her temple in Ephesus: the statue is made out of vinewood, which was originally selected by the craftsman Endoeus, according to Mucianus, who also gives an extraordinarily detailed description of the method of preserving the statue with nard (HN 16.213). Finally, Mucianus also visited the temple of Minerva at Lindus on the island of Rhodes, where he saw the breastplate which once belonged to Amasis, king of Egypt. Each thread of this breastplate apparently consisted of 365 individuals threads, which gave it strength, but in an early case of the destructiveness of mass tourism, much of the breastplate itself had apparently been destroyed by the large numbers of visitors examining the remarkable threads. As has been mentioned already, Mucianus even took the time to count the 3000 statues on Rhodes (HN 34.36). The cumulative impression created is that Mucianus has more than just a polite interest in these artefacts, and that in this respect, he is ideally suited in his temperament to his eastern province. Moreover, he is following in the footsteps of some distinguished predecessors. So, Tacitus describes in great detail (Ann. 2.59-61) the affable Germanicus' site-seeing of tour of Egypt, including a visit to Thebes accompanied by guides: 'Germanicus devoted his attention to other marvels too (aliis ... miraculis ), of which the most important included the stone statue of Memnon, which, when it was struck by the rays of the 59 The joke perhaps gains added bite, given that in the ancient world oysters were sometimes regarded as an aphrodisiac (Juv. 6.302). 60 There was a temple to Sarpedon in that city: see App. BC 4.78.</page><page sequence="16">16 VITA VIGILIA EST sun, emitted the sound of a voice ...' (Ann. 2.61. 1).61 We can also compare Titus, whose visit to the temple of Venus on Paphos (Hist. 2.2.2-2.4) may have had ulterior motives, but which included an inspection of the temple treasures and the offerings made by various kings (Hist. 2.4.1). Of course, Tacitus problematises the apparently simple enthusiasm for antiquities shown by both Germanicus and Titus, but it is a basic trait which these particular fragments of the Mirabilia suggest that Mucianus shared with them. Conclusion So where does this discussion leave us? The surviving fragments have allowed us to build up a portrait of Mucianus as a selectively efficient, but hedonistic and humorous man. His ebullient enthusiasm for wonders and his elegant literary games were ultimately overshadowed by the more depressing experience of being outmanoeuvred by the practical Vespasian, in whose ostentatiously austere and sober new world he ultimately proved to be an anomaly. Whether the Mirabilia should be seen as a product of the 70s, a disillusioned man's nostalgic escapism to better days, or instead as a document which reflects the more self- indulgent literary culture of Neronian Rome is difficult to decide, not least of all because of the fragmentary state of the text, which may or may not be a representative sampling of the original. Perhaps the most likely possibility is that this was a slowly evolving project, which Mucianus had indeed started under Nero, but continued to work on under Vespasian when it was (at some point) eventually published. It could be that Mucianus intended the Mirabilia to reflect positively on Vespasian and to generate excitement at the arrival of a new dynasty. After all, the Flavian challenge originated from the east, where many of the phenomena of the surviving fragments are located, and the publication of the Mirabilia could have been a small contribution to the collectively buoyant mood that gripped Rome after Vespasian and his sons returned for their triumph in 70. Or perhaps Mucianus, conscious of an increasingly cool response to him from the Flavian domus after the award of his final suffect consulship in 72, published the Mirabilia as some sort of a captatio beneuolentiae directed towards Vespasian and Titus. Of course, the process of making assumptions about someone's life and personality from a (fragmented) literary persona is riddled with dangers, but the character of the fragmentary Mirabilia as preserved by Pliny certainly fleshes out the rather disapproving portrait of Mucianus shaped by Tacitus. It also perhaps serves to humanise our picture of the formidably industrious Pliny the Elder, whose anti-social working methods are recounted by his nephew (Ep. 3.5). The workaholic Pliny the Elder certainly fitted into Vespasian's austere new world much more comfortably than Mucianus, in both literary and political terms, but that did not mean that he was prepared to allow the writings of Mucianus to slip quietly into oblivion.62 No other surviving writer from the ancient world preserves even one of Mucianus' 61 On Germanicus in the east, see C. B. R. Pelling, Tacitus and Germanicus' in Tacitus and the Tacitean tradition , ed. A. J. Woodman and T. J. Luce (Princeton NJ 1993) 59-85, esp. 72-78. 62 Baldwin, 'Pliny the Elder and Mucianus' (n.4, above) 301 detects a suggestive change of tone in Plinian references to Mucianus: 'The two most striking features are the irregular but growing notes of scepticism and disbelief that set in around book nine, and Pliny's generally coöl way of mentioning his name, even when in agreement'. It is not necessarily possible to uphold this assessment of Pliny's tone regarding Mucianus.</page><page sequence="17">RHIANNON ASH: THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MUCIANUS 17 fragments. Without the efforts of Pliny the Elder, it would have been as if Mucianus had never written the Mirabilia at all.63 63 1 would like to offer my warmest thanks to Barbara Levick for her enthusiasm, patience and hugely enjoyable teaching during the tutorials which I was lucky enough to have with her when I was an undergraduate, as well as for her kindness and hospitality during 1996-97 when I held a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship at St. Hilda's College, Oxford. I would also like to thank Ed Bispham and Greg Rowe for organising the original conference, as well as Elaine Matthews who helped everything to go so smoothly.</page></plain_text>
