<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTER IX Research Within Selected Programs ROBERT A. LUKE, PAUL BERGEVIN, JOHN MCKINLEY, ROBERT M. SMITH, ROBERT C. CLARK, WILSON THIEDE, and ROBERT F. RISLEY THE RESEARCH studies reported in this chapter are grouped under the following headings: public-school adult education, church adult education, library adult education, Cooperative Extension Service, university and college extension, and industry programs. Public-School Adult Education Olds (49) reported that of the 17,000 school districts with total enroll- ments of 150 or more pupils, 6000 provided adult education to 4 million or more adults. Programs ranged from remedial activities for illiterates or candidates for high-school diplomas to broad, inclusive programs meet- ing the needs of people who had already completed many years of formal education. Thaden (65) explained the low participation in rural areas by pointing out that the one-teacher school is still prevalent in most states but that school district reorganization in populous states can be expected to accel- erate the growth of adult education in rural areas. Holden (35) reported that total enrollment for 1946-47 in vocational and general adult educa- tion in the public schools of the continental United States was 2,682,786. For 1956-57 it was 4,373,054, an increase of 34.9 percent in vocational adult education and 91.1 percent in general adult education over the 10- year period. The two reports of the October 1957 Current Population Survey em- phasize the importance of distinguishing between enrollments and number of individuals reached. In most states, total enrollment means cumulative registrations rather than the sum of individuals. Holden (34) stated that in 1957 about 8 million adults attended classes which met three or more times. Wann and Woodward's study (67) of the census data is a thorough statistical analysis of the adult education aspects of the October 1957 Current Population Survey. Holden's summary of the census data (34) demonstrated that parti- cipation in adult education increased as attainment increased. The con- verse was reported by Burman (11), whose investigation of the aspira- tions of adults in lower socioeconomic levels in an urban community found that few identified their educational deficiencies or were motivated to study. In investigating the study habits of business and professional men in Long Island, Bunge (10) found little motivation toward education as a means of problem solving. In 1958, Verner and Newberry (66) examined the literature related to participation and identified the typical adult student as representative 286</page><page sequence="2">lane 1959 RESEARCH WITHIN SELECTED PROGRAMS of an urban community, tending toward young adult status, and tending also to be of lower or lower-middle economic status. Olds (49) found that only 7.7 percent of adults were enrolled in schools supported chiefly by fees. In New York (48) a survey of the effect of a state-wide tendency to establish fees for the attendance of adults in public- school classes showed that in 40 large communities registration decreased 25 percent after a fee increase. Jackson's history of adult education in Los Angeles (36) revealed that in 1932, when tuition charges averaging $1 a person were adopted, enrollments decreased 53.5 percent. Holden (33) discovered that people as individuals will most readily pay for adult education which will increase their earning ability. Conversely, they are most willing to support out of tax funds the civic and public affairs type of adult education. The October 1957 Current Population Survey of the Bureau of the Census (67) indicated that over 1 million different adults were enrolled in civic and public affairs classes during the school year 1956-57. Of this total the largest number were enrolled in group-work agencies such as YMCA and YWCA. These institutions and agencies accounted for 396,000, or 38 percent, of the enrollees. The public schools accounted for approximately 234,000 enrollees, or 22.5 percent, of the 1,043,000 adults engaged in study of civic and public affairs. The Fund for Adult Education's emphasis on liberal education stimu- lated several public-school studies. Crabtree (17) listed 45 successful prac- tices in civic education, and Snow (59) determined that a positive correla- tion exists between favorable economic factors in a community and pro- gram emphasis on liberal adult education. In a comparative study of the enrollments of California, Michigan, and New York, Holden (35) re- ported a balanced distribution between vocational and nonvocational adult education. As an inservice training device for personnel of Florida's state-supported adult education program, Hand (29) developed a pro- cedure for community study. Minnis (44), studying the expressed educational needs and interests of young adults in Iowa, found communication skills favored. In 1955, Spence and Evans (62) reported a lack of research as to drop- outs in adult education. The same year the Knoxville Evening High School survey identified such factors as seasonal employment, interference of work hours, and transportation problems (46). Substantially the same findings in Florida were reported by Reynolds (51). Church Adult Education Garrett (24), using attitude-opinion scales in a study involving 90 Methodist ministers and over 400 lay people, found (a) that ministers have favorable attitudes toward older persons in the church, (b) that older persons stress worship as the predominant curriculum category, and (c) that older persons do not desire a special group designated to satisfy older persons' needs. An interview-questionnaire study of older persons 287 lune 1959 RESEARCH WITHIN SELECTED PROGRAMS</page><page sequence="3">in the church by Gray (27), involving about 300 over 50 years of age in two Chicago churches, revealed no significant differences between younger and older church members with respect to (a) attitude toward religion, (b) participation in church activities, and (c) personal adjust- ment. McCann (39), through multiple-depth interviews with 200 subjects of various backgrounds from 15 denominations, found that 82 percent had an anthropomorphic idea of God in the beginning of their religious life. Snyder (60), investigating the response of lay leaders to group-centered leadership, found progressive acceptance and strong influence of traditional leadership concepts. Scott (53) studied the difficulties of communicating the gospel to wage earners and classified the major barriers as (a) those that are historical; (b) those that result from the behavior of church institutions; (c) those that prevent on-the-job discussion of religious faith; (d) those that derive from institutional patterns of church services, buildings, and preaching and teaching methods. A developmental study by Bergevin and McKinley (4), involving 2000 people in experimental programs in 35 churches over a four-year period, identified these basic educational problems: fear, overemphasis on lead- ership training, inadequate understanding of the adult as learner, pre- scribed needs, vagueness of aim, token evaluation, and preoccupation with content. To help solve these problems, the investigators developed and tested an experimental program based on these educational conditions: freedom of expression, training for all participants, active individual par- ticipation, sharing in program development, voluntary learning activities, formal and informal methods, and outward growth. Elkin (21), tracing the development of Jewish adult religious education in the United States, found that although the concept of sustained study characteristic of traditional Judaism lost ground in the nineteenth century, the second quarter of the twentieth century showed increase of adult edu- cation activities. Library Adult Education Recent research in library adult education, as is to be expected in an emerging field, tended to be either a survey of existing practices (50, 55, 69) or loosely designed developmental research (56, 57, 58, 68). It is open to question whether or not this phase of adult education admits of care- fully controlled research leading to safe generalizations. One major obstacle is the problem of definition: Is library adult education a body of knowl- edge, a point of view (1), a structure of services to adults (63), a con- cept that permeates the library's total program (68), or a continuous process of inservice education and adult education services to the library's community (56)? Other obstacles are the variety of sizes and types of libraries and the variety of settings in which library adult education is carried on. 288 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIX, No. 3</page><page sequence="4">The difficulties are reflected in the major research-demonstration projects of the American Library Association (described in Chapter VII of this issue). After H. L. Smith's study (55) revealed the nature and extent of current practices, the Library Community Project (68) and Phinney's study (50) of five local libraries having extensive programs both assumed the desirability of emulating such practices. Warncke (68) and Phinney (50) emphasized library self-appraisal and study of the community as a base for development of a program. R. M. Smith's tenta- tive findings questioned these assumptions; he worked out training and implementation designs through developmental research (56, 57, 58). He stressed the need to implement library adult education as a dimension of library organization and service and a process leading toward growth in self-understanding by library personnel and intralibrary teamwork and harmony; he hypothesized that these are conditions or necessary con- comitants of effective library adult education. Cooperative Extension Service The Cooperative Extension Service is a two-way channel between the people and the research laboratories. Extension takes the findings of biological science to the people it serves and assists in further testing and refining it; it also takes the problems of families to the social re- search laboratories. Brunner and Yang (7) and DiFranco (19) inquired into the origin and growth of Extension. Other major areas of study included administrative organization and management (Chapter VII), effectiveness of personnel, programs, and procedures. The scope and responsibilities of extension in subject-matter areas have been identified by Miller and others (43) as production, marketing, re- sources, management, leadership, youth, family, community, and public affairs. Earle and Evans (20) studied the programs, operational pro- cedures, policies, and personnel of marketing in eight states, and developed recommendations for resolving problems. Boyle (6) and DiFranco (18) analyzed the literature in adult educa- tion and identified program planning principles. Methods of program determination were studied by Matthews (41). Gwinn (28) concluded that members of county advisory committees in program projection should be representative, well informed, and familiar with available resources. Types of organizations and related social factors were studied by Niederfrank (47). The nationwide study of 11,494 home demonstration club members in 3156 clubs was summarized by Fessenden (22). Gilbert (25) studied the development of selected aspects of home demonstration work in the United States. The training received by county extension agents in technical agricul- ture, home economics, and related fields, was studied by Cook (16) and McCormick (40). McCormick asked county agents in Ohio to designate 289 June 1959 RESEARCH WITHIN SELECTED PROGRAMS</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIX, No. 3 their needs relative to nine areas of competency. The order was (a) pro- gram planning and development, (b) effective thinking, (c) communica- tions, (d) technical knowledge, (e) human development, (f) research and education, (g) the educational process, (h) understanding social systems, and (i) Extension organization and administration. Cook's research on the training needs of county agents in Texas revealed that most agents and state staff members did not have undergraduate training in extension education or other social sciences. Research is being conducted to determine the progress and results of Extension work. Aurbach and Kaufman (3) inquired into the knowledge and use of recommended farm practices in Alcorn County, Mississippi; 42 percent of the 139 respondents most often named the county agent as the first source of information. The Review of Extension Research, published annually by the Federal Extension Service of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and biblio- graphies of staff and graduate student research in extension provided by Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, and the University of Wisconsin are im- portant sources. University and College Extension The rationale of university extension is to be found in the place of the university in a democratic society. Early developments were in liberal studies or nonvocational areas. Later developments were job-related. Grattan (26), Hart (32), Rosentreter (52), and Stockton (64) reported on Extension's history and development. The Center for the Study of Liberal Education for Adults (13) inter- viewed evening school directors and selected teachers, and administered an attitude questionnaire to about 100 students in each of nine Middle Western institutions. Students wanted liberal education to be oriented toward the past and toward current needs and interests, viewed the teach- er's role as a dominant one, welcomed grading, expected the teacher to "cause" them to become interested in the subject, and resented require- ments but felt secure when able to meet them. Students who had held tra- dition-centered attitudes on aims, requirements, and teaching shifted to student-centered attitudes on the items dealing with institutional scope. Harrison (31) used interviews and questionnaires with similar subjects in 14 evening college programs. From differences in responses, he identified common features of designs for credit and for noncredit evening college programs and common uncertainties in designs. Eleven items on the ques- tionnaire were identified as providing opposite responses by a majority of credit and of noncredit teachers. Students, teachers, and administra- tors tended to agree in their responses to elements of course design. The Michigan Council of State College Presidents (42), acting in the difficult and important area of institutional interrelationships, em- phasized, after study of programs in Michigan, the need for joint planning, 290 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIX, No. 3</page><page sequence="6">administration, promotion, use of staff, and approach to the clientele. In addition, they recognized and supported the primary role of local institutions and the co-operating responsibility of state institutions in communities where local institutions had incorporated adult education in the local-school plan. By means of questionnaires and personal and telephone interviews with 800 drop-outs of eight Middle Western evening colleges, Carey (12) identi- fied two basic interest groups: culturally oriented and vocationally minded. Most of the vocationally minded were males, were not taking courses else- where, gave job causes and finances as reasons for dropping, were planning to return, had interrupted or abandoned educational plans, said there was too much homework, said physical facilities were inadequate, were not attracted to study, and had awareness of not getting ahead. Love (38) using paired attendees and nonattendees of the City College School of Business extension and evening division, conducted 39 depth interviews. Analysis suggested two preconditions to the sequence of enrollment. Each person who became a student (a) had an awareness of education as a positive value in the solution of problems, and (b) had equated educa- tion with success and happiness. The sequence of enrollment was identified as follows: the individual (a) must have had a current problem for which he sought a solution; (b) must have been aware of a specific course or field of study; (c) must have directed his inquiry to one or more schools dependent on acquaintanceship with other students, prestige of the school in the community, specific courses offered, and social or class grouping which the school customarily attracted; and (d) must have enrolled. Morton (45) carried out an extensive study of users of university ex- tension with data from 57 member institutions of the National University Extension Association. Omitting mass-media users, one-third were profes- sional educators and almost one-third were workers in business and in- dustry. In general, university extension served middle-aged urban people with church affiliations, with higher-than-average educational and eco- nomic levels, of both sexes, and with the principal purpose of improving their income or their job efficiency. Eighty percent felt they had no voice in determining what services would be available to them, the form and character of services, or the conditions under which the services might be used. Further research needs to be directed toward identifying the adult edu- cation roles of universities and colleges in relation to other state and local educational agencies, toward identifying clientele and their needs, and toward rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of educational services rendered. Industry Programs Review of educational research programs in industry is difficult be- cause of the variety of ways by which such research is reported and the fact that much of it is never reported in a generally available form. Edu- 291 June 1959 RESEARCH WITHIN SELECTED PROGRAMS</page><page sequence="7">cational programs of business and industry have grown to major propor- tions and cover practically every area of education, as reported by Clark and Sloan (14). Most attention has been focused on problems in management training activities. Andrews (2) reported on the difficulties in attempting to relate formal training to subsequent job behavior. He noted that trainees favor such activities, but feel that results should be measurable; and he re- viewed attempts of social scientists to provide objective criteria for measurement. One of the most widely discussed attempts to evaluate such training was that reported by Fleishman, Harris, and Burtt (23). They attempted to evaluate the results of a human relations training program by question- naire, measuring leadership behavior and attitudes on two "opposing" factors-"consideration" and "initiating structure." They found that the trained group had less consideration than the nontrained control group; and less consideration before training than after. Hariton (30) suggested that conditions outside the formal training program affected results achieved. These findings resulted in controversy about research methods, measur- ing devices, and proper approach to evaluation. Many studies have been undertaken with differing techniques in attempting to measure change. Blansfield (5) and Buchanan (8) reported positive evidence of change com- patible with training goals. Collins (15) evaluated a management training program by means of the devices used by Fleishman, Harris, and Burtt; he attempted a broader evaluation through use of sentence completion and interviews. He reported that the Fleishman, Harris, and Burtt instru- ments gave approximately the same results as the original study, but that the other devices indicated changes occurred compatible with the training. No generally accepted approach or techniques have been developed. The literature is profuse with reported attempts at evaluation utilizing differing techniques. Among recent efforts are a forced-choice rating plan, reported by Kunze (37); a "Supervisory Inventory of Human Relations," reported by Soik (61); and a plan to develop an index of change to eval- uate improvement of management through a management-development pro- gram, reported by Buchanan and Brunstetter (9). A brief report can scarcely provide a picture of the extent and range of research being conducted concerning industrial education activities. Siegle (54) described activities in liberal education for company execu- tives and noted that with the exception of an evaluation study now being carried on by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, there is little sound basis for judging these programs. Education in economics, practical politics, and other areas all raise further questions concerning appropriate content and methods of instruction. Though there has been a wholesome growth in research both by individuals within industrial or- ganizations and by individuals in educational institutions concerned with such programs, merely a beginning has been made. 292 Vol. XXIX, No. 3 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH</page><page sequence="8">June 1959 RESEARCH WITHIN SELECTED PROGRAMS Bibliography 1.
