<plain_text><page sequence="1">Besprechungen/Reviews Maria Bindschedler: Mittelalter und Moderne: Gesammelte Schriften zur Litera tur. Zur Feier des 65. Geburtstages hrsg. von André Schnyder. Bern and Stuttgart: Haupt, 1985. 402 pages. The thirty-five essays contained in this volume were written throughout the career of this well-known Swiss scholar (from 1948-1984), and have been divided by the editor into three groups: those pertaining to medieval literature, those concerned with modern literature, and some which deal with both eras. Medieval mysticism has been one of Prof. Bindschedler's main interests, and no fewer than ten articles in the collection are concerned with it. There is much of a sameness about these articles, even as there is much of a sameness about different varieties of mysticism. Bindschedler uses a fourteenth-century German poem known as Granum sinapis (because like a mustard seed it is «parvum in substantia, magnum in virtute»), possibly by Meister Eckhart, to demonstrate Greek influence on medieval mysticism. There are, she states, three main thoughts in this poem (as is the case in many mystic tracts): negative theology (i.e., one cannot say anything definite about God); the unio mystica; «die Idee der in sich bleibenden, aus sich heraustretenden und zu sich selbst zurückkehrenden Gottheit.» She finds these ideas in the writings of Dionysius Areopagita, Heraclitus and the Neo-Platonists Plotinus and Proclus. Her article on the Latin commentary to this poem (which served as an introduction to her dissertation) describes the commentary as a mosaic of quotations from many sources in which the commentator finds connections with lines in the poem. To my mind, her other articles on mysticism do not accomplish very much. She hammers away at the idea that all mysticism must begin with «negative theology» and involve a renunciation of the world, the development of a kind of tabula rasa to make possible the union with God. This is scarcely news. In line with this, she says, Meister Eckhart defines justice as the state people reach when they take everything God hands out in the same way: they must leave everything, and achieve the state of gelassenheit, as justice comes only through this condition. Equality in receiving makes possible equality in giving. Eckhart stays on the same track in a patronizing letter to Agnes of Hungary, meant to comfort her on the death of her father, Albert I. To a true Christian, he tells her, only God is the father. Sorrow, like love, is nothing for a Christian, who must learn to accept dispassionately everything that God dispenses. We do not learn whether or not Agnes was consoled. Another four articles on the mysticism of Eckhart and Seuse are concerned with minor matters (at least to my mind) involving individual words or passages, and cannot be discussed here. A broader article on poetry and mysticism, which deals mostly with the Song of Songs and the Granum sinapis again, I find more mystifying than enlightening. Bindschedler's article on Marian lyrics is much more enlightening. She notes that there is much pre-Christian material, some from Isis-worship, and a lot from the Old</page><page sequence="2">Besprechungen/Reviews 223 Testament. Most of the images are from Old Testament passages that were regarded as préfigurations of the New Testament, such as Moses and the burning bush, Aaron's rod, and so on. Many are from the Song of Songs. The poetic prayers, Bindschedler contends, are of a higher order, more passionate and more sincere, and better able to compete with the Latin ones. She believes that there must be a connection between Maria-worship and the higher regard for women that is evidenced in this period, perhaps because Mary was turned to so often in prayer. This seems more likely than her odd notion that literary personifications, such as that of Philosophia, played a role. Bindschedler also contrasts the Marian lyrics of the Middle Ages with those of the Romantic period. The profusion of images of the medieval poems are not present in those of the Romantics, which, however, are more egocentric. In a number of somewhat overlapping articles on Gottfried's Tristan, the author emphasizes the idea that the central theme in the work is the balancing of the contrastive demands of minne and ère to attain the medieval ideal of maze. Tristan and Isolde were «edele herzen» and had the necessary cunning (admired in the Middle Ages) to enable them to keep their reputations unsullied. The meaning of the work, she continues, is not political or religious, and the key lies not in heretic movements, but in «Ehrfurcht vor dem edeln herzen.» Somewhere along the way the consuming passion and despair of the lovers is forgotten. The general essay on the Arthurian romance makes some good points. The knightly community there depicted, the author states, is an «integrierende Aristokratie,» the two contrastive poles of which are represented by Gawan and Kei (ideas borrowed from Hildegard Emmel, as she notes). The classical period does not tell much about Arthur's life because it is tragic and not suitable for the courtly ideal. Similarly, Merlin is ignored because his character is contrary to the ideals of courtly love. An article on Hartmann makes the point that his knights and lovers must be socially acceptable, and must strive for giiete. While the start of love is often merely visual, beauty leads to love, loyalty and devotion. This is lucky, as all the noble women in the romances are beautiful, and the ugly peasants are presumably incapable of love anyhow. In her essay on Gawan in Parzival, Bindschedler emphasizes that Gawan not only heals the wounded knight, but also heals Orgelûse of her rage. It is strange that she does not mention that Orgelûse also heals Gawan by her love (Parz. 643,1 ff.). I think, too, that she misses the point of Orgelûse's mockery of Gawan's healing activity. It is not the action itself that is derided, but the idea that Gawan is a physician by profession, which of course would be a disgrace for a knight. Cicero's ideal, says Bindschedler, that natura must be perfected through cultura, is also a medieval one. The knowledge of the seven arts must be accompanied by discretio, «die Gabe der feinen Unterscheidung,» which allows one to observe maze. The accomplished individual moves toward perfection through love, and earthly love is a learning experience that leads to the mystic experience. Actually, this is hard to demonstrate in the worldly literature with the possible exception of Tristan. The author points out in an article on Germanic mythology that in Germanic myth the Gods are the first sinners, who often lie to combat evil forces. What is to be expected when the gods are anthropomorphic? The gods of Greece and Rome are far</page><page sequence="3">224 Besprechungen/Reviews from being angels, for instance. Bindschedler uses de Vries' suggestion that Hödr, the killer of Baldr, should be identified with Ödinn, as an excuse to pose the question, «Müssen die Menschen schuldig werden?» Probably some readers (though not the undersigned) would like to weigh the answer. In another article on punishment in the Middle Ages, the author contends that in Old Norse literature punishment is closely connected with Fate, and points to the Norn name Skuld «future,» etymologically, connected of course with ON skula, English shall, German sollen, so that, she maintains, «Das Zukünftige ist das, was einem früheren Geschehen geschuldet wird.» In the Christian literature of Germany the concept of Judgment Day dominates everything: if sins are not atoned for in this life they will surely be in the next. Bindschedler, in a longish and rather rambling article on animals in medieval German literature, discusses the beast epic, namely the Reinhard poems. Jacob Grimm and Wackernagel regarded them as being of mythological origin, while some later scholars have viewed them as having been derived from Aesop's fables, or as being a vehicle of political satire. Bindschedler sensibly takes a kind of middle ground, postulating that, though they may have been of mythological origin, they were later influenced by Aesopian fables, and had political satire added. Professor Bindschedler's articles on the literature of the modern period deal mostly with aspects of Goethe's and Nietzsche's works, and also include one on Keller's Züricher Novellen and Eichendorff's Taugenichts compared to Ernst Jünger's Afrika nische Spiele. One can only admire the breadth of her interests and the versatility she displays in dealing with so many disparate subjects. University of Tennessee Henry Kratz</page></plain_text>
