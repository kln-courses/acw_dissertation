Brown Department of Biological Sciences, State University of New York, Albany, New York 12222 INTRODUCTION Communal breeding in birds may be the most critical test case for the application of Hamilton's (54, 55) ideas about inclusive fitness, altruism, and kin selection (73a) among vertebrates. Avian communal breeding systems (ACBS) feature precisely that phenomenon that seems most likely to require kin selection as a part of its evolutionary explanation, namely, the presence of a form of operational altruism [in which gains and losses are empirically determined (16)] known as helping behavior. A helper was defined by Skutch (99) as "a bird which assists in the nesting of an individual other than its mate, or feeds or otherwise attends a bird of whatever age which is neither its mate nor its dependent offspring." The obvious questions are then: (a) What selection pressures shape the kind and degree of helping behavior? (b) Is kin selection implicated in an evolutionary explanation of helping behavior, and, if so, to what extent? (c) Does helping behav- ior qualify as altruism in the sense of Hamilton? As subjects for the study of such questions among vertebrates, communal birds have numerous practical advantages. The number of avian species having helpers runs in the hundreds. The giving of food and other kinds of aid by helpers to recipients is easily observable and quantifiable. The genetic relatedness of the partici- pants can be determined by following successive generations of individually marked animals. Most species are diurnal, relatively conspicuous, and easily watched. Their small home ranges enable numerous social units to be monitored. HISTORY The concept of a helper was originated by Skutch (96) in 1935, but was ignored as an evolutionary problem until Skutch (99) reviewed 130 possible cases of intra- and interspecific helping behavior in 1961. The pioneer field study of helping behavior by Rowley (89)-the first to elucidate its adaptive basis using color-banded birds- was published in 1965. A general theory that is particularly suitable for helping behavior was introduced by W. D. Hamilton in 1963 and elaborated in 1964 in his 123 0066-4162/78/1120-0123$01.00</page><page sequence="2">124 BROWN papers on the genetical evolution of social behavior (54, 55). In his chapter on cooperative breeding in 1968 Lack (66) endorsed the essence of a kin-selection hypothesis as follows: " . . . the habit could be favoured by natural selection, as the groups raise more young than simple pairs, and the extra members of each group are closely related to each other." Nevertheless, the reviews of Lack (66), Rowley (90), and Harrison (61) all omitted any citation of Hamilton's papers or those of Maynard Smith (73a). That avian helping behavior specifically could profitably be studied within the context of Hamilton's theory was first suggested by Williams (119) and Brown (12). Subsequent applications of kinship theory were made by Maynard Smith &amp; Ridpath (73c), Brown (15, 16), and others (41, 84, 120). The rise of kin-selection interpretations of social behavior in general (41, 121) has reached a stage at which explanations of helping behavior that rely exclusively on "old- fashioned" individual selection [explicitly excluding kin selection (124, 125, 128)] now seem almost new. Explanations based on population selection were offered by Skutch (99), Fry (44), and V. Parry (80) and rejected by Selander (94), Morton &amp; G. D. Parry (74), and MacRoberts (71). While "group selection" (in which the groups are populations, not communes) remains the "whipping boy" of contemporary sociobiology (1, 10, 12, 119), particularly at the interface with the so-called "social sciences," its theoretical plausibility has, if anything, been strengthened (7, 50, 67) in recent years. Its natural history underpinning, however, remains so weak as to justify excluding it from further consideration at this time. If there is one point on which students of helping behavior agree, it is that a diversity of origins of helping behavior is likely (44, 45, 84). Brown (15) sketched five potential types of origin, and the addition of others seems imminent. CHARACTERISTICS OF AVIAN COMMUNAL BREEDING SYSTEMS Communal breeding as a social system is defined primarily by the regular involve- ment of helpers in the feeding and care of the young. In contrast, typical colonial species do not regularly have helpers and are hence excluded. Some colonial species, however, do have helpers (44, 92a, 99). Unlike typical colonial species, communal species tend to live in small (2-20 members), relatively stable units (minimal immi- gration and emigration) with communally defended, all-purpose territories, which they rarely leave. Members of a social unit in most species on such territories tend to stay together at all times, whether roosting, foraging, or resting. In contrast, individuals of colonial species tend to move with more independence, congregating temporarily at concentrations of food or at restricted nest sites but frequently leaving one aggregation, going their own way, and joining another. The behaviors typical of helpers are listed in Table 1, where they are divided into those traditionally thought to benefit or harm the breeding pair. Helpers range in age from juveniles only a few weeks old to mature, breeding adults, depending on the species. The age and breeding status at which helping occurs are characteristics of the life cycle of the species.</page><page sequence="3">AVIAN COMMUNAL BREEDING SYSTEMS 125 A most important characteristic of helping behavior and ACBS in many species is deferral of breeding to an age of two or more years. Consequently, the evolution of helping behavior in these species is inextricably bound to the evolution of delayed breeding. The period of the delay is spent in the status of a helper. In some species breeding is deferred in both sexes. In others, because of an excess of males, the delay affects only excess males. Sexual dimorphism is rare in ACBS and when present is likely to be inconspicuous (except in Malurus). Monogamy is common, polygamy occasional, and promiscuity rare, as expected by kinship theory (84). Polyandry occurs. The taxonomic diversity of ACBS is impressive. ACBS are found in 10 orders (ostrich, geese, hawks, rails, terns, anis, swifts, kingfishers, woodpeckers, and song- birds) (52, 53, 91, 125, 129). ACBS are most conspicuous in the Passeriformes, where they have been recorded in 32 families and subfamilies. The food and foraging methods used in ACBS are diverse (45). In general, insects are prominent in the diet of most species (53) while nectar and fruit specialists are rare. The habitats in which communally breeding species live are extremely varied and offer no common denominator (45). Dramatic geographical patterns in the distribution of ACBS occur. ACBS are rare in Europe and North America, and common in the tropics and Australia (44, 52, 53, 91, 125, 129). This distribution pattern of ACBS, overlapping only marginally with the geographic distribution of scientists, explains in part why ACBS were ignored so long. Although many communal breeders fall into a small number of categories, the diversity of systems used by different species is impressive. ACBS can be classified in many ways. Eight of the important variables by which species of ACBS differ are listed in Table 2. A hierarchic classification of ACBS made using these variables would be long and cumbersome, and so is not offered here; but the list is useful to designate different types of ACBS. TSY is probably the most common type, found Table 1 Behavior of helpers. Helpers may perform some or all of these be- haviors, depending on the species.

Since each condition is designated by a unique letter the social system of a species or a set of species can be designated by a list of letters as speciflcally as desired. "Unit" is a breeding pair plus associated nonbreeders (usually helpers) and breeders sharing the same territory if type T, or same nest if type C. Variable Specification 1. T Territorial All-purpose territory defended by unit at some stage of breeding cycle C Colonial Nests highly clumped. Colony foraging area undefended but nests commonly defended at some stage 2. L Lodge builders One superstructure constructed by colony houses all nests (type C only) I Independent nests No superstructure constructed (type C only) 3. S Singular breeding Only one breeding pair per unit usually P Plural breeding Two or more breeding females per unit commonly 4. U Joint-nesting Single nest for all pairs in unit. All pairs feed all young W Separate nests for all pairs in unit. Breeding females normally feed only own nestlings 5. M Male helpers almost always, when postjuvenile and unmated F Female helpers almost always, when postjuvenile and un- mated E Equal numbers of each sex approximately, when postjuve- nile and unmated 6. J Juveniles from early broods often feed later broods in same season Y Yearlings are youngest age class to feed young B Juveniles and yearlings or older birds feed young 7. Q Quick breeding Age at first breeding 1 year in one or both sexes D Delayed breeding Age at first breeding 2 or more years in both sexes 8. A Almost always some unmated helpers (juveniles excluded) Z Zero unmated helpers at many nests, but helpers normally present at some nests (Juveniles excluded) R Rare. Unmated helpers rarely present at any nest (juveniles ex- cluded) in jays and babblers (15, 49). TPUQ is atypical, found in Crotophaga and Guira (30-33, 65, 111, 112). CL is known only in Philetairus (70) but may be more common if helpers are found in other lodge-builders. TERMS Helper, although said to be anthropomorphic (34, 80, 89, 91), has become estab- lished. It is useful because it is descriptive and defined by empirical parameters, not hypothetical fitnesses. These parameters are precisely the features that make helping interesting in evolutionary biology, i.e. aid-giving in the absence of a parent- offspring relatedness. Use of "helper" says nothing about the effects of helping on</page><page sequence="5">AVIAN COMMUNAL BREEDING SYSTEMS 127 fitness; that is a separate problem. "Helping" has been most useful for aid-giving behaviors that are "normally" exhibited only by parents toward their own offspring, and in this review is restricted to that context. In practice "helper" should be applied only to individuals who have met some arbitrary, operational, behavioral criterion of helping, such as feeding young, nestbuilding, or incubating in birds; some non- breeding-unit members may then not actually qualify as helpers. Exactly which criteria should be used depends on the species and context of the discussion and should be specified. Extending the behavioral criteria beyond parental-type behavior to include such aid as alarm-giving and other anti-predator behavior would so broaden the definition that it would apply to virtually all social vertebrates (making it useless). Although the second part of Skutch's definition (see Introduction) allows this, such an extension would lead to confusion. "Helper" can be used with reference to any group of animals, including insects and primates. Workers, "aunties" (87), and alloparents (121) qualify as helpers. Units (9) in ACBS are social units (16, 19) of two or more members, including at least one potentially breeding pair. Members of a unit associate together and share the same territory if type T or nest chambers if type C. Flock and group are sometimes used, but these are awkward when used for groups of two (mated pairs). To dichotomize between groups of two and communal groups of three or more I suggest pairs and communes or clans; however, it has become common to use the more general and less descriptive term, group, for the latter. Communal and cooperative breeding are regarded as synonomous in this review, as they have been since 1968 (66). Nevertheless, a brief review of the history of these terms seems justified because of persisting confusion between them. Communal and cooperative as applied to nesting or breeding were used in the 1930s in a nontechni- cal way (e.g. 43, 116). In 1947 Armstrong (3) used communal to apply to types PU, S, and colonial lodge-builders indiscriminately. In 1959 Van Tyne &amp; Berger (1 10) formally restricted communal nesting to type PU while reserving cooperative nest- ing for colonial lodge-builders implicitly lacking helpers. In 1968 Lack ignored this distinction and equated cooperative with communal, excluding CL species (because helpers were then unknown in Philetairus) but including S and PW species along with type PU. Crook (28) grouped lodge-builders, PU, and PW plus several other types under "communal social organization and cooperation." Wilson (121) desig- nated CL species without helpers as communal and PU species as cooperative- exactly opposite to the usage of Van Tyne &amp; Berger. A glance at the Literature Cited Section of this review reveals that cooperative and communal have since 1968 been used virtually interchangeably. To try to maintain a formal distinction between them now would be futile and confusing. Instead, distinctions of the sorts discussed above and in this paper can be made more precisely using the types listed in Table 2. I have chosen to avoid cooperative as an empirical term because it was used by Hamilton (55) to designate certain fitness relationships on a theoretical level. To use the same term empirically and theoretically might lead to confusion. The diagnostic feature of communal breeding is the presence of individuals in a social unit who behave as parents but are not the genetic parents of the offspring whom they aid.</page><page sequence="6">128 BROWN In type T the diagnostic behaviors include nestbuilding, incubation, feeding off- spring, and defense of the territory. In type CL, because unaided pairs share in building the common superstructure, nestbuilding should be excluded as a diagnos- tic behavior. Similarly, defense of the nest in colonial species is excluded; owing to the proximity of their nests to those of other pairs, unhelped pairs in effect share in nest defense while defending only their own nests. Species in which two or more females may lay their eggs in the nest of a single male to whom they are only transiently bonded, such as certain tinamous, have been called communal (66, 112); but because they lack helpers, i.e. the mothers do not care for each other's young (or for their own), by the definition employed in this paper they are not communal. BENEFITS OF HELPING TO RECIPIENTS Lack (66) with support from data on Malurus (88) accepted the idea that helpers benefit breeders. Since then the idea has been popular and has bolstered theories invoking kin selection (12, 15, 73c, 84). Without such benefit, of course, kin selection would find no support except in the usual parent-offspring context. Zahavi (128, 129) in his attacks on kin selection claimed that helpers actually harm the breeders. Because of the theoretical importance of estimating the magnitude of beneficial or harmful effects by helpers on breeders this question has been a focus of recent field studies. Here we examine reproductive success as a function of the number of helpers in a unit. In the simplest situation (type SZ) success in the presence and in the absence of one or more helpers can be contrasted. All such cases with sufficient data, listed in Table 3, show a greater number of offspring per unit with helpers than without. Table 3 Reproductive success with and without helpers in type Z species. Numbers of offspring were counted at various stages depending on the study. flg/n = fledglings per nest. ind/yr = independent young per year. br/unit = actual breeders per unit. surv/unit = surviving young per unit.

H. Fry, M. Dyer, personal communication bNot significant c Significant</page><page sequence="7">AVIAN COMMUNAL BREEDING SYSTEMS 129 However, the difference is not always significant. In Passer, units with and without helpers did not differ in "fledging success" (92a), but these data mean little since the measure of comparison was not adequately specified. The next higher level of complexity (type SA) is found in those species that nearly always have some helpers but vary in the number of helpers. Positive correlations at varying levels of significance have been found in Turdoides squamiceps (17), Melanerpes (71), Turdoides striatus (49), Prionops (unpublished, C. J. Vernon), Plocepasser (unpublished, D. Lewis), and Pomatostomus [(24) and personal obser- vation]. In the most complicated case there may be more than one laying female in a unit (type P) and units without helpers may or may not be rare. In such species a positive correlation between unit breeding success and unit size (as in Aphelocoma u., J. L. Brown, unpublished) might mean merely that as unit size increases more females are laying. However, in Corcorax Rowley's (92) data suggest an increase in success with one female as unit size increases from 2 to 5, then a decrease followed by an increase from 6 to 11. The first peak seems to represent units with one laying female; the second peak, units with two. In both cases success increases with number of nonbreeding helpers, then decreases. Survival in Corcorax was also better in larger units. In Porphyrio, type TPUD, no increase in reproductive success with unit size was observed in 28 units (J. L. Craig, unpublished manuscript); however, a complete analysis has not yet been made and effects of unit size on survival of juveniles and adults are not known. In Gymnorhina "permanent groups" averaged larger than "marginal groups," and the former averaged 0.56 "weaned" juveniles per female as opposed to 0.09 for the latter (21). Annual reproductive success was similar for all unit sizes in Crotophaga (S. L. Vehrencamp, unpublished manuscript); however, information on the effects of nonbreeding helpers separately from effects of breeders is not yet available. In short, despite two possible exceptions in type PU systems and one in SZ, about 14 species that have been investigated in detail have shown some sort of positive correlation (occasionally not quite statistically significant) between number of non- breeding helpers and breeding success. In no case can a detrimental effect of helpers on breeders be supported. Failure to find a statistically significant effect does not prove biological insignificance. The sample may have been too small, or contained too few of the inferior unit sizes; and the investigator may not have measured the appropriate parameters or considered nonlinear relationships sufficiently. Lest the reader be too easily persuaded by the positive evidence of benefit to breeders from helpers, it should be remembered that in no species has a thorough analysis of all influences of unit size on fitness been completed and that still undiscovered disad- vantages of helpers (e.g. attracting predators) might cancel the apparent advantages. UNTANGLING THE CORRELATIONS We have seen that reproductive success is often correlated positively with number of helpers, but is this a cause-effect relationship? What other factors might be correlated with both reproductive success and number of helpers? Lack (66) sug- gested two, territory quality and parental experience.</page><page sequence="8">130 BROWN An important part of the theory that I elaborated for the evolution of ACBS (12, 15) was the concept that communal genotypes (both parents and helpers) benefit from their greater success in getting and keeping territories, particularly, high- quality ones. Since 1969, evidence that differences in unit breeding success are related to differences in territory quality has become available for several species (see Table 4 for common names and background information), e.g. Pomatostomus halli Table 4 Common names and background information for genera mentioned in the text.

Craig, unpublished manuscript), Phoeniculus (J. D. Ligon, personal communication), Plocepasser (D. Lewis, personal communication), Pomatostomus temporalis (per- sonal observation). In Crotophaga (S. L. Vehrencamp, unpublished manuscript) and Porphyrio differences in breeding success were associated with habitat but not with unit size. In the above studies the authors singled out aspects of territories that they thought were significant for the birds, such as trees for nesting, insects for food, etc. In the study on Pomatostomus halli the birds themselves indicated which parts of their territories were important to them through their time budgets (18). Size of territory has been linked to unit size positively in Dacelo (80), Tribonyx (85), Aphelocoma c. (125), and Melanerpes (71) and negatively in Crotophaga (S. L. Vehrencamp, unpublished manuscript). However, no correlation between unit size and territory size could be found in Porphyrio (J. L. Craig, unpublished data). Evidence that age of parents is correlated with both number of helpers and breeding success is available for Aphelocoma c. (124), Pomatostomus t. [(24) and personal observation] and Tribonyx (85). However, in Malurus experienced pairs without helpers failed to average more offspring than comparable inexperienced pairs (89). Briefly reviewing the evidence for type S species, reproductive success per unit is correlated not just with (a) number of helpers, but also in some cases with (b) habitat quality, (c) size of home range, and (d) parental age. Because of their evidence on Pomatostomus h. and the knowledge that possible effects of some of these variables may have been confounded in previous studies-with no clear indica- tion of which is cause and which is effect-Brown &amp; Balda (18) challenged the conventional conclusion that helpers directly cause increases in parental reproduc- tive success. Furthermore, they concluded, "As an effect of helpers on the fitness of recipients is necessary to invoke kin selection, it follows that the role of kin selection in the evolution of avian communal breeding systems also must be ques- tioned." If all factors correlated with breeding success except helpers could be held con- stant while the number of helpers was varied experimentally, the effect of helpers on breeding success could be evaluated independently of territory quality, parental age, and other possible correlates of unit size. One way to accomplish this is by removing the helpers from some units, reducing them to a size comparable to the smallest units in the population. Three of several possible outcomes may be consid- ered. (a) If the helpers were detrimental, as suggested by Zahavi (128, 129), and implied by Woolfenden (125) by use of the Hamiltonian term "selfish," their re- moval should enhance success. (b) If helpers had no influence, their removal should be without effect. (c) If the influence of helpers predominated over the influence of territory suitability and age of parents, removal of helpers should reduce success to near the level of natural units of the same size as the experimentally reduced units. In such an experiment on Pomatostomus temporalis nine units reduced from an original size of 6, 7, or 8 to an experimental size of three by removing all nonbreeders but one, produced no more fledglings per unit than did ten natural units of three, while ten natural units of 6, 7, or 8 produced nearly twice as many fledglings per unit during the same period (J. L. Brown, D. D. Dow, unpublished data). These</page><page sequence="10">132 BROWN results strongly favor the idea that in Pomatostomus helpers somehow actually cause increased reproductive success. These findings constitute the first experimental proof in any vertebrate species of a beneficial effect of helpers on parental fitness. They are, however, tentative, pending a complete analysis. In any case, they should not be generalized to other species nor used to exclude other variables from serious consideration. WHAT ARE THE MECHANISMS? Helpers have been observed aiding breeders in a variety of ways (Table 1). And the reproductive success of breeders has been shown to correlate positively with the number of helpers. But which effects in Table 1, if any, are actually responsible for the correlations? Since helpers typically bring food to young, it is natural to begin with the hypothe- sis that the young might be better fed as a function of the number of helpers (28, 94, 105). This hypothesis can be tested by recording rates of delivery of food to nestlings in units with different numbers of helpers. Such studies are usually compli- cated by the predominating influence of other variables, such as number, age, and weight of nestlings or various environmental factors (e.g. 98). By stepwise multiple regression and by standardizing as many variables in the field as possible, it was possible to demonstrate that in Pomatostomus the rate of feeding of nestlings did not increase significantly with number of helpers (J. L. Brown et al, unpublished manuscript). An increase in the rate of feeding of nestlings with more helpers has not been found in some other species where sought, e.g. Corcorax (92), Turdoides j. (113), Dacelo (80), Aegithalos (47), Crotophaga (S. L. Vehrencamp, unpublished manuscript) but it was found in Merops (M. Dyer, personal communication), Passer (92a) and Phoeniculus (J. D. Ligon, personal communication). Present evidence suggests that feeding rates of young may be increased by helpers in certain species or circumstances but that often they are not. Available data are, however, fragmen- tary or unpublished; thus the above hypothesis cannot yet be regarded as adequately investigated. An alternative to observing feeding rates is to monitor growth of nestlings fed by units of different size. In Picoides (formerly Dendrocopos) Ligon (68) found that nestlings gained weight faster when fed by more helpers, but he studied only two nests with helpers. In Todus (63) growth was more rapid at one nest with helpers than at others without. In Merops, with a larger sample, growth of the third nestling was more rapid in broods aided by helpers (M. Dyer, personal communication). Clutch size is usually not correlated with unit size in an ACBS of type S; but in Todus and Tribonyx, nests with helpers averaged significantly larger clutches than those without (63, 85). Comparing nests with and without helpers, it is obvious in ACBS generally that helpers reduce the percentage of feedings done by parents. In Pomatostomus t. the parental percentage decreased as helpers increased up to four, but not above four. Generally, it seems safe to say that helpers lighten the load of the parents in feeding their young and, consequently, probably reduce possible risk and energy cost to the parents.</page><page sequence="11">AVIAN COMMUNAL BREEDING SYSTEMS 133 How might "lightening the load" be translated into more offspring per season? A classic demonstration of this was provided by Rowley in Malurus (89). In M. cyaneus the second adult male helps to care for the first brood of fledglings, thus presumably enabling the female to incubate a second clutch sooner. Moreover, the first brood even feeds the second and third broods. In several species the principal advantage of helped over unhelped pairs was the greater number of breeding at- tempts per year by helped pairs, e.g. Malurus (89), Dacelo (80), Pomatostomus (J. L. Brown, D. D. Dow, unpublished data), Phoeniculus (J. D. Ligon, personal communication), Plocepasser (D. Lewis, personal communication). This might be caused in part by the role of helpers in lightening the load of the parents in caring for early broods. Helpers also aid in territorial defense of resources needed for reproduction, both lightening the parental load and increasing the effectiveness of the unit. In Gymnor- hina helpers rarely feed nestlings, who are cared for mainly by their mother (21). By elimination, therefore, the benefit of helpers to breeders in Gymnorhina is likely to be either through (a) helping parents to defend a more productive nesting area, (b) enabling mothers to reduce risk to their young by leaving their nest less often to drive out females, or (c) enhancing juvenile survival, or some combination of these. An advantage of larger units in territorial confrontation with smaller ones has been noticed in several species, e.g. Gymnorhina (21), Dacelo (80), Aphelocoma c. (125), Phoeniculus (J. D. Ligon, personal communication), Porphyrio (J. L. Craig, personal communication), Pomatostomus t. (personal observation) but was thought to be unimportant in Crotophaga (S. L. Vehrencamp, unpublished data). A benefit to the breeders that does not depend on lightening the feeding load arises from the anti-predator behavior of helpers. In Aphelocoma c. the principal benefit of helpers to nestlings seems to arise in this way (124a). In Dacelo (80), Tribonyx (85), and Corcorax (92) the benefits in juvenile survival exceed those in production of fledglings. The role of survival in older immatures or nonbreeders as a function of unit size has been little investigated, but since first breeding may occur between ages two and five years, this factor deserves more attention in ACBS. The mechanisms by which helpers raise the reproductive fitness of breeders in various species appear from the evidence cited to be diverse, including effects on clutch size, number of nests per year, nestling feeding rate, nestling growth, and survival of fledglings and older juveniles. Some of these effects may be mediated by direct actions on young, or on parents, or indirectly through territorial defense. Judging their relative importance is at present difficult. BENEFITS TO NONBREEDERS THROUGH INDIVIDUAL FITNESS In this and the following two sections another objection is considered to the use of kin selection to explain ACBS, namely, that all aspects of ACBS can supposedly be explained by means of traditional individual selection. Here we document the exis- tence of aggressive competition among individuals within units and consider how far ACBS have been and can be explained by advantage to individual fitness, both by advocates and opponents of kin selection.</page><page sequence="12">134 BROWN Competition among individuals to reproduce has long been considered in ecologi- cal theories of ACBS, including my own (12, 15, 94, 125, 128), and is not incompati- ble with the use of inclusive fitness concepts or kin selection (12, 15). Competition within units is probably most intense during contests for breeding status (see the section on Intrasexual Competition, below). In type S species much behavior of individuals can be interpreted as tactics to achieve breeding status. In type P species is added the complication of competition among breeding members of the same sex in the same unit. At other times the interests of individuals in maintaining the commune probably predominate. Individuals in ACBS live in a fabric of individual rivalry within units but never- theless probably profit in several ways by living communally. To achieve these individual benefits they must to some extent coordinate their activities as a unit and control behavior that might disrupt the unit. In contrast to the case in noncommunal species, in ACBS these requirements persist even during the breeding season. Evi- dence of both aggression among individuals and its control in ACBS is the ubiquity of dominance relationships or hierarchies, which have been noted in natural popula- tions in Malurus (89), Gymnorhina (21), Aegithalos (47, 77), Dacelo (80), Aphelocoma c. (126), Tribonyx (85), Crotophaga (112), Melanerpes (71), Porphyrio (27), and in captivity in Aphelocoma u. (56), Pomatostomus (B. King, unpublished thesis, University of Queensland), and Manorina (35). Hierarchies can probably be found in every communally breeding species. Compared to that in noncommunal species, intragroup aggression in ACBS is relatively restrained. A conspicuously low frequency and intensity of aggression within units has been casually noted in Monasa (101), Crotophaga (33), Tribonyx (85), Corcorax (92), Pomatostomus h. (5), Struthidea (69), Cyanocorax (82), and other genera. And, of course, the acceptance of additional members into an exclusive territory, as in all type T species, implies selective reduction of aggression within a unit. Reduction in the intensity of agonistic interactions in communal species relative to congeneric noncommunal species is particularly noticeable in Aphelocoma (9) and Cyanocorax (58), though not in Tribonyx (85). Restraint on aggression within units is predicted by kinship theory (15). The frequent occurrence of such restraint in ACBS has not been adequately explained by opponents of kin selection. Helpers in some communal breeders (e.g. Manorina), far from being unaggres- sive, are actually incredibly vicious toward virtually all species (38), but these species are atypical of ACBS in several ways (39, 40, 107). The prerequisite for reproductive status is survival in the nonreproductive period. Given the delayed onset of breeding in many communal breeders, where would a nonbreeder find a better place to survive until breeding age than with its parents in a home range already familiar to it and possibly improved by it through storage of food or dormitory construction? If the home range is temporarily unsuitable, non- breeders may simply accompany the breeders in short wanderings to places probably known to the older unit members, as in Corcorax (92), Melanerpes (71), and Malurus (88), and return when conditions improve. Even in some species in which immature yearlings do not help to feed nestlings, as in the migratory blue-snow geese</page><page sequence="13">AVIAN COMMUNAL BREEDING SYSTEMS 135 (Chen coerulescens, 23) and the nonmigratory Gymnorhina t. dorsalis (86), the young commonly share the same home range as their parents through their first year. Obviously, it is in the parents' interest for their young to survive, and if any risks must be taken to insure the survival of their young, the siblings and parents are the individuals that should be most likely to take them. Living in a group when not breeding is a common strategy for survival among vertebrates (16, 121); both breeders and nonbreeders should benefit from flocking during the nonbreeding season and perhaps in some circumstances also in the breeding season. In brief, it is not difficult to suggest advantages to both parent and offspring of continued association between them until the offspring can breed. Unfortunately, there seem to be no data with which to test these ideas in ACBS. The existence of delayed breeding is also easily explained without kin selection. Presumably breeding is delayed in ACBS for the same reasons as in other birds- a high cost/benefit ratio for breeding during the period of delay (12). What are the costs and benefits of early breeding in ACBS? We can only speculate, because so few facts are available. Another advantage to the individual nonbreeder of remaining in its natal unit may lie in easier access to breeding status. Since the first extensive color-banding study on a communal species by Rowley (88), it has been evident that individuals can use helper status as a stepping-stone to breeding status either in their own or a neighbor- ing territory. This transition has been observed in nearly every territorial species that has been studied long enough to detect it [Malurus (88); Aphelocoma c. (124, 125); A. ultramarina (J. L. Brown, unpublished observations); Phoeniculus (unpublished observations); Porphyrio (J. L. Craig, unpublished manuscript); Turdoides, spp. (49, 128); Corcorax (92); Melanerpes (71), and also in one colonial species, Merops (C. H. Fry, M. Dyer, personal communication)]. The idea that remaining in the natal territory is an individual strategy for attain- ing breeding status under severely competitive conditions has been suggested several times with slight variations (12, 15, 124, 125). Selander (94) first stated it clearly in 1964: Assuming that adult mortality rates are relatively low and invariable from year to year in tropical species, it seems likely that there would be a greater tendency in tropical areas for the habitat of a species to be more fully and consistently occupied by breeding pairs of adults. Under these conditions, a young, inexperienced bird dispersing from the paren- tal territory might have little chance of establishing an adequate territory and breeding. Possibly there would be greater advantage to the individual, in terms of total reproductive success, in delaying reproduction and remaining on the parental home area on the chance that the parental territory or an adjacent area with which the bird was familiar would become available. Chances for survival presumably would be greater and, by serving as a helper, the young bird would gain experience in parental activities which could enhance reproductive success later in life. [p. 206] The fact that nobody has disagreed with such formulations suggests that the ideas are plausible but not stimulating-particularly in the form of strong-inference hy- potheses. The ideas that there may be an optimum age to disperse (with variation</page><page sequence="14">136 BROWN among individuals) and an optimum unit size from which to disperse (with individ- ual variation) are at present essentially impossible to test for technical and practical reasons. Perhaps the most difficult behavior to explain via individual selection exclusively (without kin selection) is the raising of young by helpers. The nonbreeders probably do not have to feed the young to remain in the breeder's territory; in Gymnorhina, nonbreeding members of a social unit typically do not feed the nestlings (21, 86), and in Aphelocoma u. and Pomatostomus, nonbreeding unit members who rarely if ever feed the nestlings have been observed (J. L. Brown, unpublished data). Why then do nonbreeders feed young? The usual first guess by those who disdain kin selection is "for the experience." There are difficulties with this answer. Of course, first-time breeders are less successful than experienced breeders in many birds, including communal species [e.g. Aphelocoma c. (124); Tribonyx (85)], so experi- ence in breeding seems to count sometimes. But in Malurus (89) experienced units of two birds produced no more fledglings than inexperienced units of two. If breed- ing experience cannot be shown to be beneficial in Malurus, helping experience is even less likely to be beneficial. Most important, it remains to be shown in any species that breeding success among first-time breeders is positively correlated with presence or duration of previous experience as a helper. A negative correlation might just as well be expected if the most fit individuals are the ones who breed first, as seems likely in view of the need for dominance to attain breeding status. The young produced with the aid of helpers are potential competitors of the helpers to some extent at least, even if they are subordinate. Against this disadvan- tage of helping may be placed some plausible advantages to individuals. The young so raised also contribute to keeping the size of the unit large enough to reap the hypothetical survival benefits of group living (16). Furthermore, the young pro- duced may in turn help the present helper in acquiring a breeding territory [sup- posed by Woolfenden (125) in Aphelocoma c.] and might become helpers to the present helper should the latter accede to breeding status in the same territory (15), which in A. ultramarina happens not uncommonly (J. L. Brown, unpublished obser- vations). These advantages are of particular interest because they constitute a previ- ously unrecognized form of reciprocation, which may be termed unconscious. This reciprocation is achieved without the necessity of remembering social obligations, as in Trivers' (108) intraspecific model. It would be maintained by selection pressure against nonreciprocators. Genotypes whose carriers did not help when they were young nonbreeders would also fail to receive the benefits (from the young they might have raised) when they become breeders (1). Since the benefits are measurable and the costs of helping are speculative and possibly nil, individual selection might favor unconscious reciprocation. The dispersing sex, since it reaps fewer such benefits from the young it helped to rear, would be expected to help less than the nondispers- ing sex-if these were the principal benefits of helping behavior to the helper. Summarizing, the struggle for dominance, though present in communal units and constituting evidence for individual competition, appears to be subdued in many but not all species. This conforms to one of the predictions of kin-selection theory. Remaining in the natal group and deferral of breeding are widely agreed to be</page><page sequence="15">AVIAN COMMUNAL BREEDING SYSTEMS 137 individual strategies for attaining reproductive status, although indirect benefits through inclusive fitness are not ruled out. It has been speculated that helpers benefit individually both by acquiring experience in feeding young and from the subsequent presence of the young produced. Quantitative data on these speculations are lacking, but do exist for benefits through kin selection (see the section on Evaluating Kin Selection, below). There remains much room for quantification and evaluation of the various advantages for individuals that have been proposed. COLONIAL SPECIES In the study of helping behavior, colonial species (type C) are of interest because the home range of the colony is presumably freely available to nonbreeders whether or not they associate with or help a particular pair. If this is true, the costs and benefits of helping can be separated from the fitness economics of territoriality, which seems important in noncolonial species (type T). This seems to remove several of the above hypotheses from consideration and thus reduce the possible number of explanations. For example, since the parental home range is the same as the colony's, it should be of no advantage in terms of home range quality for excess (nonbreeding) males to remain with their parents. For survival one unit should be as good as the next; and for achieving breeding status and avoiding incest, a unit other than the parental unit might even be better. There is also no chance in a colonial species that the young an individual might feed as a helper would facilitate his becoming a breeder by enlarging the communal feeding territory (because no such territory is presently known). In short, there seem to be few advantages other than experience, not mediated by kinship, that an individual of a colonial species might garner for himself by feeding the young of others. Adequate data for a colonial species are not yet available, but preliminary results on Merops suggest that helpers have significant effects on the feeding rates of nestlings, their growth, and successful fledging, and that helpers are frequently closely related to the young they help [(44); and C. H. Fry, M. Dyer, personal communication]. In Hirundo, helped nests seem to fledge more young than unhelped ones under adverse weather conditions (G. R. Myers, M. S. thesis, Kent State University). Helping is known in several other colonial species that have not been intensively studied (4, 44, 45, 99). In most colonial species helping is considered exceptional. INTRASEXUAL COMPETITION When there are two or more mature members of the same sex within the same unit, a potential exists for intrasexual competition different from that between units: The rival is tolerated in the commune. Particularly among females, intra-unit competi- tion may take the form of robbing each other's nests (9), destroying each other's eggs (9, 112, 124), and laying by two or more individuals in a single nest (type PU). Males compete within a unit to father the offspring. In more conventional social systems intrasexual competition is either virtually unrestrained and separated from paternal</page><page sequence="16">138 BROWN care, as in leks, or severely restrained and coupled with paternal care, as in monogamy and to a lesser extent in polygamy. In ACBS, however, a middle ground occurs in certain species; nonmonogamous mating may be combined with extensive parental care. Teleologically, we may postulate that a female must receive some advantage to compensate her for allowing another female to lay in her nest. Simi- larly, males who tolerate polyandry presumably have compensatory benefits. Although type PU is regular in Crotophaga (30, 32, 33, 65, 97, 112), Yuhina (127), Corcorax (92), Porphyrio (26), Melanerpes (71), Guira (31), and occasional in Pomatostomus t. [(24); personal observation], Aphelocoma u. (personal observa- tion), and other genera, the only systematic investigation of the adaptive advantage of sharing a nest for females is that of Vehrencamp [(111, 112) and unpublished manuscript]. Since Crotophaga breed when one year old, and do not have a severely distorted sex ratio, the class of nonbreeding birds available to serve as helpers is small. The communes are composed mainly of 1-4 monogamous pairs and their juvenile offspring (65, 111, 112). The females lay their eggs in a single nest; but each female rolls the others' eggs out of the nest until she begins laying herself (112)-a marvelous starting point for specialization as an interspecific brood parasite. Once incubation begins, however, incubation, brooding, and feeding of the young are shared by all (unequally). Vehrencamp's careful analysis (unpublished manuscript; Ph.D. thesis, Cornell University) suggests that the advantage of the use of the same nest by multiple pairs lies primarily in reduced mortality of the incubating or brooding adults rather than in enhanced production of fledged young. In other species, additional females and males in a unit may be prevented from breeding by "psychological castration" (21, 59), since removal of the breeding pair can result in immediate assumption of that role by other, previously nonbreeding, birds in the unit. The potential exists for competition among males for females within communes in most type M species. Copulation of a female with more than one male has been observed within communes in Buteo (114), Parabuteo (72, 73), Merops [(44); C. H. Fry, personal communication], Manorina (40), Porphyrio (J. L. Craig, unpublished manuscript), Melanerpes (71), Gymnorhina (86), and Tribonyx (85). Helper males have also been observed in Falco sparverius (1 15) and Accipiter striatus (64). Pre- sumably the obvious disadvantage of polyandry for males is offset by actual present or potential future gains in production or survival of offspring. In Parabuteo, communes outproduce pairs, but the tactics of individual males are unclear. In Tribonyx the game-theoretic tactics of males have been examined (73c), but the advantage of communes over pairs in production of young has been questioned (J. L. Craig, unpublished manuscript). In Manorina melanocephala, females nest indi- vidually, but their young are fed by up to 14 males (34-40). The female copulates conspicuously with many of these "at all stages of the nesting cycle" (40), and the question arises (D. D. Dow, personal communication) of whether this behavior "tricks" the males into caring for her young. [Wolf (122) has suggested that such behavior results in a different advantage for female hummingbirds.] These species, which combine intriguing aspects of mating systems with communal breeding, pose several questions that have not been adequately studied.</page><page sequence="17">AVIAN COMMUNAL BREEDING SYSTEMS 139 EVALUATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS In the kin-selection literature considerable emphasis has been placed on the values of r in Hamilton's original inequality, k &gt; 1/r, where r is relatedness, and k is the ratio of recipient gain to helper loss (15, 41, 73c, 109, 121). However, unless k can be estimated, the value of r is of little use. More specifically, unless there is a gain from helping, there can be no kin selection for helping. This review has dealt mainly with putative gains and losses because that is where the practical problems lie-not with relatedness, the estimation of which is relatively easy. Hamilton's original equation above has been modified for use in evaluating help- ing behavior (16). Slightly modified, the criterion for kin selection to favor helping behavior by an individual potential helper, H, is G rHO L rHR where G = number of offspring raised by a helper above what the unaided parents would rear; L = number of offspring a helper could have raised if it attempted to rear its own; rHo = relatedness of helper to its own offspring; and rHR = relatedness of helper to the recipient offspring, not its own. Assuming no inbreeding, since rHo is constant, the relatedness ratio, R = rHo / rHR, is determined by the value of rHR. This is determined by the survival and nondispersal of the parents. When both survive and remain, rHR = 0.5; when only one, rHR = 0.25; and when none of the parents is left, rHR = 0. It can be shown that on the average rHR = s'/2, where s is the fraction for the popul' n of parents surviving and remaining in the helper's unit to the next breeding season, and t is the age of the helper in years. In most cases offspring remain in their natal territories until mature, and breeders remain in their units until death. Consequently, in these cases the adult survival rate, which does not vary much with age (83), is in most cases a good estimate of s. Since rHo = 1/2, the critical relatedness ratio for the average helper is R = Ils'. Without inbreeding, R is minimal at 1.0 when both parents remain. When s is 0.80, as in Aphelocoma c. (123), R averages 1.25 in the first year and 1.56 in the second. The maximum value of L can be estimated as the average number of offspring an unaided pair would rear. Maximum L corresponds to the second "without" column in Table 3. G is the gain in offspring attributable to a helper. The minimum G can be roughly estimated as the difference between the "with" and "without" columns in Table 3 divided by the average number of yearling or older helpers per unit. So calculated, G/L exceeds the criterion for helping, R, only in yearling Tribonyx; for the others it ranges from 0.18 in older Tribonyx to 0.83 in experienced Aphelocoma c. These estimates neglect an important factor, namely, the probability, F, of obtain- ing a mate and being able to breed if an individual opts against helping and for breeding. The estimate of potential loss becomes L = FL max In juveniles and in delayed maturity F = 0. In some circumstances F is determined by contingencies</page><page sequence="18">140 BROWN in the life of an individual. When an excess of males occurs, F - 0 for those remaining after all females are mated. In type PW species, if the brood of one pair fails and it is too late to renest successfully, F 0. In Aphelocoma u., failed breeders often become helpers at other nests within the unit (personal observation). In type SZ species, individuals of a failed pair may also become helpers. Probably in Aegi- thalos (47, 77) and perhaps in Psaltriparus (98), failed individuals commonly help at nests of other pairs that shared their communal winter territory (42). And in colonial species, such as Gymnorhinus [(4); R. P. Balda, J. Balda, unpublished manuscript] breeders from failed nests may help to feed fledglings and older nest- lings of other pairs in the colony. Even with delayed breeding, contingencies are important. Since dominance is required for breeding and an individual usually knows about where he stands in this respect, he can estimate F for himself and judge whether to try breeding or helping. In all these cases since F 0, L 0 O. Consequently, even with small G it is likely that GIL &gt; R, thus satisfying the requirement for helping. These considerations suggest that the most important determinant of the tactics of a potential helper is F, not G/Lmax The most important determinants of F are delayed breeding and the various contingencies mentioned. For selection to favor helping, given a low value of F both G/L max and R must also be favorable. Since F is frequently low in similar contingencies in noncommunal species, the rarity of helping behavior there may be due to low R, low G, or lack of individual advantage from helping. Although it is possible to refine the criterion GIL &gt; R by incorporating new variables that bear on G,L and R, it hardly seems necessary for most cases because L is apparently zero or so close to it that the difference is not empirically detectable. In other words, in ACBS when a nonbreeder has a chance to breed, it does; when it doesn't, it has the option of helping and frequently uses it. The criterion for the individual to help, GIL &gt; R, is clearly met in such cases. ORIGIN OF HELPERS AND RELATEDNESS TO BREEDERS Yearling and juvenile helpers are commonly young from the preceding brood that failed to leave their natal unit, as shown by color banding in Malurus (89), Pomatos- tomus t. (personal observation), Corcorax (88), Melanerpes (71), Aphelocoma spp. (14, 124), Cyanocorax (2), Porphyrio (J. L. Craig, personal communication), Phoeniculus (J. D. Ligon, personal communication) and others. In some species helpers usually join a unit from outside the unit, as shown by color banding in Tribonyx (85) and Gymnorhinus (4), and suspected in Buteo (114) and Todus (63). Little is known about relatedness of helper to breeder in such cases, but average relatedness is presumed to be low. However, in a few cases unisexual sibling groups commonly change units together, thus providing an opportunity for kin selection [e.g. Tribonyx (85); Merops (44); Phoeniculus (J. D. Ligon, personal communication); Prionops (C. J. Vernon, personal communication)]. That helpers are often closely related to their beneficiaries is so widely accepted that it is, unfortunately, often simply assumed. Close relatedness has been the strongest argument for invoking kin selection. Is the argument necessarily weakened</page><page sequence="19">AVIAN COMMUNAL BREEDING SYSTEMS 141 by the fact that helping also occurs where relatedness is likely to be low? Helping by "strangers" occurs rarely both interspecifically and in essentially noncommunal species (99). These situations typically arise when a breeder that has been feeding large young of its own loses them and, while still strongly motivated to feed young, discovers begging young nearby. This is most likely to happen in colonial species, since opportunities are numerous because of proximity of nests and synchrony of breeding. It seems fairly regular in Gymnorhinus [(4); R. P. Balda, unpublished manuscript] and possibly Hirundo (76), where it is probably increased in frequency by widespread nest failure caused by inclement weather. Relatedness between helper and young is also reduced by 1/4 when a breeder is replaced from outside, which probably happens at least half the time. In Crotophaga this dilution effect is intensified because up to four pairs are present in a unit and the young tend to leave before they are a year old. Consequently, juvenile and yearling helpers are closely related only to the fraction of eggs laid by their own mother. Similarly, even breeders are related by 0.5 only to a fraction of the eggs. Even though little is known about relatedness in Crotophaga units, for these reasons it is likely to be lower than in other communal species. Low relatedness between helper and beneficiary in one species is not necessarily evidence against kin selection in other species, and in certain circumstances may be in conformance with kinship theory. Many benefits of group living are known that occur in noncommunal species and are unlikely to be due to kin selection (16). It should not be surprising if in some species the adaptive value of helping does not arise via kin selection. High relatedness is expected mainly in species that are specialized for communal life. Species that acquire helpers when the young have fledged [e.g. Gymnorhinus (4)] or through breeding failures by neighbors [e.g. Aegithalos (47, 77)] are less special- ized in respect to helping and probably less dependent on helpers. When these helpers are often related and when GIL is large we might expect selection to lead to greater social specialization. On the other hand, if GIL is small or negligible and benefits are mainly to individual fitness, as in Passer, Crotophaga, Gymnorhina, Gymnorhinus, Porphyrio and Aegithalos, we should not be surprised if rHR is low. The acquisition of helpers from within a unit might be expected to result in incest and inbreeding. However, there have been surprisingly few reports of incest, consid- ering the number of studies of color-banded birds. On the contrary, incest seems to be avoided by dispersal. My earlier suggestion (15) that a high relatedness within units of Aphelocoma might result from inbreeding was based on assumptions that now, with additional data, seem unrealistic. There is more dispersal than the early data indicated. Although some individuals do breed in their natal unit, incest has not been observed any more frequently in Aphelocoma than in noncommunal spe- cies. The idea that a high average relatedness within a deme, brought about by a patchy environment or reduced dispersal or both, might be conducive to the evolution of helping (15, 81, 121) deserves reconsideration. The criterion for helping by an individual (GIL &gt; rHo/rHR) is affected by inbreeding in birds mainly if they leave their deme or otherwise escape the region of inbreeding. If a female leaves her deme,</page><page sequence="20">142 BROWN her mate is likely to be less closely related than if she stays. Consequently, her own offspring and potential helpers will be more closely related to their parents if she stays than if she leaves. If females often faced this choice (arising by certain combi- nations of deme size and isolation), helping would be favored by kin selection more by staying than by leaving. However, it seems likely that females are not often faced with this choice. Demes are probably big enough in most populations with ACBS to ensure that mates can be found within the deme without incest. Consequently, the relatedness of a female to her parents is likely to be the same as between the female and her daughters-regardless of how inbred the deme is. This relationship is more easily appreciated using Brown's form of the criterion for helping (see above) than Hamilton's (54, 55) original one, k &gt; llr. In Brown's equation it can be seen that the effects of inbreeding in elevating r in the deme as a whole tend to cancel each other out and do not necessarily lower the threshold for helping unless coupled with an asymmetry in dispersal. The cancellation is complete only when rHR = rHo, but in many ACBS this is the most common condition. EVALUATING KIN SELECTION If we are to compare the genetic contributions of helping behavior attributable to kin selection, a common currency, such as the Malthusian parameter, m, is needed. We can then compare the effects of various changes in life history parameters on m. Life-history data suitable for such studies seem to be available in Pomatostomus and Aphelocoma and probably also for other genera. No published data have been analyzed in this way, but the time is ripe. Part of the problem in evaluating kin selection is in deciding what to explain with it. We need not invoke kin selection to explain delayed breeding, nor has that been suggested explicitly by previous workers. Similarly, kin selection is not needed to explain the strategies by which nonbreeders achieve breeding status, although it is relevant when emigration occurs in sib-groups. At least one anti-kin-selection posi- tion (125) argues that being a helper is a device to obtain a territory and that this is the principal adaptive value of being a helper. However, the value of being in the natal territory for achieving breeding status has been agreed on by all authors (e.g. 12, 15, 94, 125) and is not a bone of contention. Kin selection was invoked by Lack and subsequent authors to explain not the presence of nonbreeders, but their behav- ior-specifically their role in assisting in the production of offspring not their own. There is virtually no quantitative evidence to support evolutionary hypotheses for such behavior without kin selection, so let us examine some quantitative evidence for kin selection. Although advantages to breeders from helpers have been documented above, their impact on a population basis remains vague. Even critics acknowledge that kin selection operates in the helper-recipient context (124, 125), but they feel it is insignificant biologically. One attempt to estimate the importance of helpers on a population basis has been made for Pomatostomus (J. L. Brown, unpublished data). By regressing the number of fledglings per unit on unit size, the average number of</page><page sequence="21">AVIAN COMMUNAL BREEDING SYSTEMS 143 fledglings produced by a unit of two in one breeding season was estimated as 2.0. The number of fledglings produced in the population was then partitioned into those attributable to the breeders as if unaided (2.0 X number of units - 92) and the remainder, attributable to helpers (151 - 92 = 59). Roughly 39% of the reproduc- tion of the population in the year was attributable to helpers. Since most helpers in Pomatostomus are yearlings and since virtually all yearlings stay in their natal unit, the relatedness of most helpers to the young they helped to produce was high; if s = 0.8 then rHR = 0.4 for yearlings, 0.3 for two-year-olds. These tentative findings suggest that helpers in Pomatostomus are quite successful at getting their genes (ibd) into the population by helping. Since the data for Pomatostomus and other species are incomplete and only partially analyzed, caution is advised. However, the differ- ence in m between two theoretical genotypes in Pomatostomus, with and without helpers, seems tentatively to be large enough to be a significant factor in the evolu- tion of helping behavior. By a similar method the percentage of offspring attributable to helpers, I, can be estimated for the species in Table 3. In this case the number of offspring attribu- table to pairs is the product of column 5 times the sum of columns 2 and 3; and the total offspring is the sum of columns 2 times 4 plus 3 times 5. The percentages vary from 9 to 47 and are high in species in which most units have helpers and low in Merops, which has relatively few units with helpers, and in older Tribonyx (Table 3). The distinction between kin selection and population selection (better known as "group selection") (11, 73a) is fundamental (16, 73b, 120) but has not always been carefully drawn by students of ACBS. For the record, those authors who have invoked kin selection for ACBS were among the first to object strongly to the use of "group selection" to explain social systems (e.g. 10, 12, 66, 119). None of them, I am sure, would invoke population selection for ACBS. Although kin may associate in communes, such groups are not demes [contra (15)] and do not imply population selection. Kin-group selection (15), which I invoked for communal groups, is sub- sumed under the trait-group selection of D. S. Wilson (1 19a), and is basically a form of kin selection (73b), not population selection or "group selection" in the sense of (73a). There seems to be a tendency to use altruism and kin selection as straw men. The literature contains no hint that proponents of kin selection for ACBS intended it as a complete explanation of all aspects of communal social systems, obviating the need for simple individual selection. Indeed, one such proponent even developed the principal "competing" theory, that helpers remain in their natal territory for their own individual advantage (12), and pointed out the competitive nature of reproduc- tive behavior within communes as early as 1963 (9). Actually, as this review shows, those aspects of ACBS for which kin selection is appropriate are quite limited. To reject kin selection for other inappropriate aspects of ACBS on the grounds that it is not needed is a red herring. It draws attention away from the real issues. Accumu- lation of information on ACBS from studies now in progress should clarify the role of kin selection. One ought not to reject it a priori, as did Zahavi (129).</page><page sequence="22">144 BROWN DO HELPERS SACRIFICE? All workers seem to agree that membership in a communal unit is part of a non- breeder's individual strategy for achieving reproductive status. However, by caring for young, nonbreeders may also face risks that they could otherwise avoid. Although Hamilton's concepts of altruism and cooperation identify interesting theoretical questions, they are virtually impossible to differentiate in field studies and they draw attention away from other important problems. In theory, the only individual sacrifices that will not be eliminated by individual selection are those that are compensated by gains in inclusive fitness. The upper limit of the latter can be estimated empirically. The average maximum sacrifice that might be expected of a helper in a given year, Smax, is Smax = G/R = 2 GrHR = Gs' offspring. For Pomatostomus in 1976, each helper added an average 0.4 fledglings per year to the offspring of its unit. Assuming s = 0.8, Smax would be 0.32, 0.25, and 0.20 fledglings for helpers aged 1, 2, and 3 years respectively. These estimates suggest that even if the largest possible sacrifice were being made, it would be difficult to detect. The average numbers of fledglings produced as their own offspring by all birds (breeders and nonbreeders) of ages one to four were 0.00, 0.33, 1.20, 3.04. Compar- ing this series with the series of values for Smax, which represents a helper's genetic contribution in fledgling-equivalents, it appears that in terms of inclusive fitness an individual does better from age two onward by breeding than helping. Most individ- uals begin breeding at three or four years. But only 14% of two-year-olds attempted breeding; 86% remained as helpers. Yet the few two-year-olds observed breeding were as successful as older breeders. Why then did not more two-year-olds breed? Were they sacrificing their individual fitness because the sacrifice was compensated by gains in inclusive fitness? Cooperation in Hamilton's sense (55) includes behavior in which both donor and recipient benefit relative to the population. In selfish behavior the recipient must lose relative to the population. Cooperation can be divided into two types: in R-coopera- tion, the recipient benefits more than the donor; in D-cooperation, the donor benefits more than the recipient. Kin selection is needed for R-cooperation to evolve because relative to the recipient the donor loses. In R-cooperation the donor experiences a gain relative to the population but a loss relative to the recipient. Consequently, an individual gain can be a relative sacrifice. In a hypothetical example, a helper might gain a little experience while raising unrelated young of another genotype. The gain to the helper's genotype being less than the gain to the recipient, there would be a relative loss to the helper. Such losses could be compensated by kin selection. In other words, labeling helping as cooperation instead of altruism does not alleviate the need for kin selection. To conclude at this point that no sacrifice is involved and that kin selection is not significant (125, 128-130) seems premature. Helping behavior clearly qualifies as operational altruism. Furthermore, there is much about it that is suggestive of individual-fitness altruism or R-cooperation. In view of the objections discussed above, my unqualified designation of helping as altruism in 1970 must also be regarded as premature but provocative (13). At that</page><page sequence="23">AVIAN COMMUNAL BREEDING SYSTEMS 145 time I made an implicit assumption, common in ecology, that food is a currency with some relationship to individual fitness. Consequently, I assumed that gains and losses in food bore at least some relationship to gains and losses in individual fitness. Subsequent experience has not verified this assumption. I now believe that we lack sufficient quantitative evidence to decide whether helpers gain or lose in individual fitness by helping and whether they delay breeding longer than they would if kin selection were not involved. In other words, we do not know if helping is individual- fitness altruism, R-cooperation, or D-cooperation. That it is Hamiltonian selfishness (125, 129), however, seems unlikely in most species. The controversy over whether or not helping behavior qualifies as altruism in Hamilton's sense is not settled; and it is difficult to see how it can be, given the imprecision of present-day field studies, the lack of comprehensive approaches, the confusion over terms and concepts, and the anthropomorphism that is rampant in contemporary sociobiology. THE DEMOGRAPHIC ENVIRONMENT Although it is sometimes possible to note correlations between social organization and environment (28), such correlations by themselves usually shed little light on the ecology and evolution of social systems. This is especially true for ACBS, where the range of foods, foraging habits, habitats, and climates is very wide (44, 45). More important for ACBS is the demographic environment. In many or most ACBS helpers are drawn from the surplus of nonbreeders, the density of which, NE, "is determined by the number added to the population each year in excess of the number needed to maintain the fixed upper limit of density of territory holders, a, and by the rate of survival of the surplus individuals, s," such that NF = a/(1-s) (12). Plotting this relationship with appropriate values for ACBS [e.g. s = 0.7-0.8; see Figure 1 of (12)] reveals that high survival of the nonbreeders leads to a large surplus. It has been shown mathematically that "the loss in reproductive potential due to evolution of delayed maturity, although large in species with low survival rates, is much less severe in species with high survival rates" [(12) and elsewhere]. High survival, then, is conducive to delayed breeding in two ways: by increasing the surplus and by diminishing the penalty of a lower reproductive rate. These demo- graphic considerations led me to suggest that a relatively high rate of survival was conducive to ACBS and to postulate a K-selection phase in the evolution of ACBS (15). This was supported by the high adult survival rate of Aphelocoma u. [0.72-0.80 (unpublished observation)], and has subsequently been bolstered by reports of high survival rates in other communal species, e.g. Aphelocoma c., 0.8 (123); Pomatos- tomus ruficeps, 0.78 (46). The environmental correlation that has received the most attention is the more frequent occurrence of ACBS in tropical than temperate and arctic regions (44, 45). To explain this I proposed (15) that the difference was related in two ways to the fraction of long-distance migratory species, which is smaller in the tropics: (a) Families in migratory species presumably remain together less often (hindering kin selection); and (b) temperate and arctic species are more r-selected (i.e. lower</page><page sequence="24">146 BROWN survival). Fry's (46) survey strongly suggests that survival rates are higher among tropical species. Modeling of life history tactics has suggested that when juvenile mortality fluctu- ates, longer life, delayed reproduction, and small clutches are favored (62, 75, 93). This set of traits resembles the set associated with K-selection, but is associated with a variable environment (producing variable reproductive success). In 1974 I predicted from the K-selection postulate that ACBS might be favored by stable and climax environments. This prediction, based on the mathematical models available in 1972, has not been borne out. As noted by Hardy (58a), some communal jays (Cyanocorax melanocyanea, C. sanblasiana, C. yucatanica) are characteristic not of climax forests but of edges and disturbed forests. The situation is similar for some of the other communal jays listed in [(15), personal observations]. Similarly, the occurrence of helpers in residents of harshly seasonal northern regions (Sitta, Aegi- thalos, Gymnorhinus, Aphelocoma u., Psaltriparus, Melanerpes) does not suggest stability. Furthermore, in much of Australia (89-9 1), Africa, India, and the Ameri- cas communal breeders are found in semiarid, open woodlands that are character- ized by unpredictable yearly rainfall. Yearly variation in breeding success is conspicuous among communal species inhabiting these areas (e.g. Gymnorhinus, Melanerpes, Aphelocoma u., which depend on nut crops that are irregular), and the disproportionate representation of different year classes in the population is com- mon [e.g. Aphelocoma u. (J. L. Brown, unpublished data); A. c. (124); Merops (C. H. Fry, M. Dyer, unpublished data)]. In contrast, at least in Aphelocoma u. adult survival rates vary little. Unpredictable rainfall is frequently associated with nomadism, especially in Aus- tralia; and its relation to ACBS is puzzling. But communal breeding may be an adaptation to such conditions among species with relatively poor powers of dispersal and good survival, for whom nomadism would be uneconomical. Communal living combined with territoriality might facilitate survival during nonbreeding periods in these regions. It might also ensure that when conditions suitable for breeding arrive, the commune is immediately able to take advantage of them and to rear the maxi- mum number of broods in the time available (91). In the Artamidae, however, nomadism is combined with communal roosting and breeding (91). Gathering the above life-history traits together, we find that they fit nicely the syndrome recently named "bet-hedging" (106). The predictions of "bet-hedging with juvenile mortality variable" as listed by Stearns (106) are late maturity, iteroparity, smaller reproductive effort, longer life, fewer young per brood, and more broods. Considering that "juvenile mortality" (construed widely to include repro- ductive success) must now be considered to be variable in many species, the K-selection postulate must be reconsidered. Although the K-selection postulate still fits species with constant juvenile mortality, it should be supplemented with a bet-hedging postulate for populations with variable juvenile mortality. In other words, ACBS can be favored in stable and in varying environments so long as the fluctuations affect the production and survival of young more than the survival of adults.</page><page sequence="25">AVIAN COMMUNAL BREEDING SYSTEMS 147 Since demographic environments favoring ACBS occur in many families and orders, adaptations that bring about such environments by increasing survival are likely to be diverse. One, however, is surprisingly widespread. Stability of adult survival and increased survival of nonbreeders may be achieved in some species by improvements to the territory. One type of improvement common in ACBS is a persistent nest used throughout the year for sleeping, as in Pomatostomus (5), Plocepasser [(22); personal observation], Philetairus (70, 117), Phacellodomus (100), and Campylorhynchus (94, 98). In the above species rather elaborate covered nests are constructed. Other communal breeders use cavities in trees or banks for roosting, which might also be regarded as improvements, as in Sitta (78), Merops (44), Picoides (68), Melanerpes (71, 95). As shown by temperature measurements in the nests of Philetairus and Myiopsitta (both lodge-builders) (6, 20, 117) such devices can allow energy savings in thermoregulation during temperature extremes (22). Another type of improvement is food storage. It is prominent in Melanerpes (71), Aphelocoma (9), Gymnorhinus (4), and Cracticus. These improvements, namely, food storage, and protective roosting nests, probably enhance survival during unfa- vorable periods, thus contributing to the surplus of potential breeders. COMMUNICATION Are there characteristic adaptations in the signals used in ACBS? No universal traits stand out but some specializations have been speculatively associated with ACBS in certain groups. A loud song given by a single male in territorial proclamation seems to be rare in ACBS, being found only in Gymnorhina (personal observation). Instead, the proclamation function has often become a pair (duet) or communal affair. Loud, stereotyped vocalizations given by two or more members of a unit in synchrony or rigid sequence are characteristic of Phacellodomus (100), Monasa (101), Limnocorax (8), Campylorhynchus (1 18), Pomatostomus, Dacelo, Cracticus, and Pitohui (personal observations). Jays, prionopids, and picids tend to call to- gether but in a less-stereotyped temporal pattern. In experimental tests a communal species of Aphelocoma called more at a stimu- lus owl than did a noncommunal population of A. coerulescens, and learning seemed to be more important in the effectiveness of the owl as a stimulus in the communal species (29). Calling sessions are typically accompanied in several species by close- range, visual signaling participated in by all or most unit members. Communal species living in forest tend to lack long-range visual signals, but species living in open woodland frequently have large patches of white or color on dark wing and tail that are conspicuous mainly in flight, as in Pomatostomus, Corcorax, Cracticus (personal observations), and Prionops (51). These flight signals are thought to facilitate coordination of movements within units and are found mainly in species that forage in close-knit social units over a large, open area. Close-range signaling is common in ACBS, probably often involving dominance status. Changes in color of eye or bill are correlated with age and presumably also</page><page sequence="26">148 BROWN with status in Pomatostomus (25), Psilorhinus (96), Corcorax (92), Turdoidesjar- dinei and other species (48, 113), Phoeniculus (J. D. Ligon, personal communica- tion), Aphelocoma u. (9, 56), and Cyanocorax (57). Manorina has an unusual tongue-display used at close range (37). Cyanocorax threatens by expanding its yellow iris (58). Allopreening and allofeeding may also have signal functions related to dominance (58, 60). Such close-range signaling may prove to be important in modulating intra-unit aggression at levels that do not significantly reduce inter-unit competitive effectiveness. Communal defensive displays in which unit members cluster around a belea- guered individual and display or call in concert against the predator have been described in Corcorax (88). Allopreening in many communal species is conspicuous among all members of a unit throughout the year, in contrast to its restriction to a mated pair at limited phases of the breeding season in a relatively small number of noncommunal species. Allopreening is found in Campylorhynchus (60), Struthidea (69), Tribonyx (85), Pomatostomus h. (5), Crotophaga (97), Turdoides spp. (60, 129), Porphyrio (26), Malurus (89), and Cissilopha (58), but not in Aphelocoma, Parabuteo, Buteo, Todus, Melanerpes, Phacellodomus, Philetairus, Manorina (35), or Gymnorhina. LIFE CYCLE STRATEGIES In many communal breeders with delayed reproduction offspring typically remain in the natal territory until they reach breeding age. It might be suggested that in such cases parents "manipulate" or exploit their offspring in the sense of Alexander (1). Presumably this means using them as unwitting workers to boost parental reproduction while temporarily keeping them functionally sterile. At the other extreme it has been argued that the offspring are really exploiting their parents ( 129), sponging off the food and safety of the parental homestead and even attempting to oust the parents and usurp their prerogatives. These are, of course, simply an- thropomorphic and one-sided ways of dramatizing the fact that even parents and offspring may have complexly conflicting interests as individuals. If we are to understand these conflicts we must look not just at individuals with different roles; we must examine the life-history design features that underlie them. These features are selected to maximize inclusive fitness of genotype, not individual fitness of parents or offspring. All vertebrates exhibiting parental care, whether solitary or social, progress from early dependence on parents, through an independent nonbreeding period, to breed- ing status. In social animals the switch from nonbreeding to breeding status is complicated by the vagaries of the social environment, which vary with demogra- phy. The switch from nonbreeding to breeding is contingent not just on gonadal maturity but also on role relations with other individuals. The evolutionary success of a genotype depends upon the success of its individuals in switching roles at optimal times and places. Therefore, identification of environmentally cued role- switches might repay further investigation [e.g. as in (21, 59)]. Communal species may be specialized to allow greater flexibility in switching roles.</page><page sequence="27">AVIAN COMMUNAL BREEDING SYSTEMS 149 From the standpoint of individual fitness there must be an optimal average age for the role-switch from nonbreeder to breeder; it should occur when the individual has acquired sufficient experience to justify the risks of seeking dominance over others of its sex in a territory. For an individual in a noncommunal species the switch to breeding should occur as early as possible. In communal species the situation is more complicated since present evidence suggests that reproduction of the genotype is served by nonbreeding helpers in some species as well as by breeders. For a genotype in these species the optimal age for this role-switch might, in theory at least, be delayed (i.e. might involve individual sacrifice). One genotypic strategy then might be to produce broods in which all phenotypes practice as nearly as possible the sequence of helping and breeding that has the highest inclusive fitness. A more likely genotypic strategy, one that obviates individual sacrifice, would be to increase the variance in predisposition to help-for example, by increasing vari- ance of role-switch age. Through variance-enhancement, genotypes that produce both good helpers and good breeders in the same family might in some environmen- tal conditions have a higher inclusive fitness than genotypes whose strategy was to minimize phenotypic variance within families. The offspring in a variable brood need not be manipulated nor must they be altruistic (sensu Hamilton) to realize their maximum inclusive fitness, since, for each, helping is an inverse function of the probability of breeding successfully. This theory explains the paradox that operational altruism is common while individual-fitness altruism (16) is difficult or impossible to detect. Those individuals with little or no chance to breed successfully make little or no sacrifice by behaving as helpers. Variance-enhancement is a principle of potentially universal application in species with helpers (or workers). Helping in unspecialized species may be favored by naturally occurring variance, termed variance-utilization. In specialized species genes that increase helping via skewed adult sex ratios or increased variance in conditions of ontogeny may have been selected through variance-enhancement. Variance in the time of switching from nonbreeding to breeding status arises as a result of the opportunistic flexibility of individual behavior, and also as the result of other kinds of variation among individuals. Individual flexibility is evident in the opportunistic nature of assuming breeding status in communal birds generally; switching occurs when a vacancy arises, not automatically at a certain age. In plural breeding species, such as Aphelocoma ultramarina, individuals can also switch from breeding back to helping status when their own reproductive efforts of the season fail (J. L. Brown, unpublished observa- tions). One way in which variance in age of role-switch arises "naturally" among individ- uals in ACBS is via an excess of males (e.g. in Merops, Malurus, Tribonyx). In other species, a considerable variance occurs in both sexes (e.g. in Aphelocoma) for a variety of reasons. An individual's strategy for achieving breeding status involves the successful choice of the right opportunity. Perhaps the variance is mainly in the opportunities rather than in the birds.</page><page sequence="28">150 BROWN But perhaps not. The existence of a dominance hierarchy within a commune (documented above) provides a natural source of variance. The dominant individu- als of each sex may be the principal contenders for rapid elevation to the throne of reproduction, while the subordinates have to wait longer. Dominance within a brood probably depends partly on physical condition and size. The variance in these parameters can be altered through selection by changes in several factors affecting growth of nestlings. If incubation begins before the last egg in a clutch is laid, hatching will tend to be asynchronous. The earlier nestlings to hatch will get a bigger head start on the later ones in asynchronous hatching than in synchronous hatching. They may also grow faster, as observed in Pomatostomus (17a). Variance in size and physical condition among nestlings can also arise through natural variance in hatching weight. It has been shown that young from larger eggs grow faster than young from smaller eggs in altricial passerines (79). Of course, feeders can increase the disparity in growth rates of nestlings simply by feeding the largest in a brood preferentially, as observed in Dacelo (80). Asynchronous hatching is known among ACBS in Philetairus (70), Corcorax (92), Aphelocoma u. and c. [personal observation; (123)], Pomatostomus (17a), and Porphyrio (J. L. Craig, personal communication). The variance in egg weight in communal breeders compared to other species is totally unknown. Variance in nestling growth rate is also almost unstudied in ACBS. Of course, asynchronous hatching and other causes of variation in nestling weight and adult status have more traditional and parsimonious explanations than the above. Still, we ought to be aware of the possibility of variance-enhancement, if only in order to disprove it. Since variance-enhancement might supplement the more acceptable processes, how- ever, its existence may be difficult to support or disprove. Flights of fantasy aside, it must be forcefully affirmed that the facts do not really support the existence of worker-like adaptations in birds. In the social insects, however, I suggest that variance-enhancement has resulted in some of the life- history features that increase the variance in conditions of development of female larvae-resulting in the behavioral differences between queens and workers. Many examples of variance-enhancement and variance-utilization may be found by com- parative study of the ontogeny of social insects. CONCLUSIONS The potential of avian communal breeding systems for illuminating the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for sociality in the vertebrates has recently stimulated a surge of interest, a spate of speculation, and many attempts to field-test competing theories. Probably more studies on communal breeding are currently in press and in progress than have been published in the entire history of the subject. These studies are revealing that the species termed "communal" are often fundamentally different from each other, sharing only a few traits, such as various kinds of helping behavior. The selection pressures operating in these species may also be extremely different. Probably the most controversial question has been the role of kin selection as a common denominator among evolutionary mechanisms in ACBS. There has</page><page sequence="29">AVIAN COMMUNAL BREEDING SYSTEMS 151 been no serious disagreement about the sufficiency of classical individual selection to account for most aspects of ACBS, such as the remaining of offspring in their social unit, their delaying breeding, aiding in territorial defense, and even feeding young. It has been proposed that kin selection may reinforce the latter two actions. In some ways the argument in the 1970s against kin selection for helping behavior parallels that in the 1960s against population selection for territorial behavior: If helping or territorial behavior can be explained by individual selection, no further theory is thought to be needed. There are, however, two critical differences. (a) The conditions needed for population selection to be important have never been demon- strated to match the occurrence of territorial behavior. In contrast, the conditions needed for kin selection have repeatedly been shown to exist in conjunction with helping behavior. (b) There was little direct evidence that population selection favored territorial behavior and much evidence that individual selection did. For helping behavior, specifically the feeding and care of young, the situation is reversed; there is much direct evidence favoring kin selection and little or none for individual selection, except that helping occurs in some circumstances where kin selection is speculated to be unlikely. Conditions for kin selection are found in those communal systems in which the young remain with their parents long enough to help them. These cases satisfy Hamilton's criteria: Gains have been demonstrated and measured in the field, losses have been shown to be negligible, and relatedness is typically close. Furthermore, those species with demonstrable gain and close relatedness are the ones in which a sizable fraction of the young produced by the population are attributable to helpers. In some species in which the gain is negligible or the relatedness is low, or both, the fraction of young attributable to helpers is negligible. In these species it is doubtful that kin selection for helping is important. These species include a variety of social systems. In most of them delayed breeding is absent or inconspicuous, the bond between helpers and recipients is transient or weak, and the occurrence of helpers is irregular; but exceptions are numerous. In summary, conclusions must be tentative because no species has been thor- oughly analyzed. Individual selection is of great importance in creating the condi- tions necessary for the appearance and further specialization of helping behavior. Such specialization does not seem to require kin selection in all cases, but kin selection seems to have been biologically significant in the most common case, that in which offspring aid their parents.
