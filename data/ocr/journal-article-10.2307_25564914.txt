One of them, Alex the lion, is about to undergo a major identity crisis in the absence of his normal supply of sirloin steak. In Dublin, a 'dead zoo', the Natural History Museum, is currently washing up on the unfamiliar shore of its own future. It's a museum for which many in Ireland have great fondness, among them many an aspiring artist. Why? In her article here, Sherra Murphy mentions one display in particular, the badgers; its arrangement is more or less that of the 'perfect' family, human or mammal. Part of our fondness for the museum, the zoo, or Madagascar, flows from such anthropomorphism, as we project our own concerns onto other critters. But for all its apparent Victorian stasis, the Natural History Museum has transformed itself repeatedly since its inception, allowing some aspects of its identity to match our own, as a society and as a state. Facing the future, the identity of the Dead Zoo is in danger, or so it would seem, even though that identity has never been fixed. Identity is tricky at the best of times, and it is something artists negotiate incessantly; artists are often acutely uncomfortable about their identities, perhaps at no time more so than when a show of their work is about to open. Identity can be deliberately blurred, though, sometimes as a strategic move to contest the sway of identity as the thing of most value, the 'brand' of the artist; and sometimes because two or more minds are more creative than one. In this issue Isobel Harbison and llaria Gianni look at two specific examples of artistic identity-blurring, those of 'Claire Fontaine' and of Nina Canell and Robin Watkins. One of identity's sneakiest tricks is its instability, while the word itself seems to hold the promise of fundamental stability. And one of the ironic tricks of science fiction is to use temporal change - a jump to the future - to scrutinise our current identities; radical change allows a sort of essentialism to emerge, as we are invited to see what is left over from our 'old' behaviour. If that is a sort of shorthand, grand theory of sci-fi, the form sci-fi takes among some artists in Ireland is excitingly short-circuited; as Chris Fite-Wassilak outlines in his article here, these artists engage in a disturbing sci-fi of the present; no need for a future identity, the present one is odd enough! As the Wall came tumbling down in 1989, the then chancellor of West Germany, Helmut Kohl, turned two state identities into one with what was probably undue haste. I liked the old East Berlin. When crossing to it via Checkpoint Charlie, the border officer told us that our visas were not valid, and that we would have to go to Alexanderplatz to change them before he could let us through; having disburdened himself of this officialese, he then let us through, probably as the only way of reconciling himself with the fact that Alexanderplatz was in East Berlin. A bit like the border officer, East Germany seems to have been a (pretty grim) place where things worked somewhat, most of the time, with only the fallibility of the system to keep it human. Meanwhile, West Berlin was a draw for youth from across West Germany, as residents were exempt from military service. Now there's two halves of a city whose identity has been through the mill! In art terms, since 'the Wall', we had been hearing how Berlin was 'the new New York'; now it seems, based on David Ulrichs' trilogy of articles in this issue, that Berlin is very much itself, on a grand scale, New York or no New York. And it's a pleasure, along the way, to get insight into the work of Aleana Egan. Finally, a bugbear of many an artist: the curator. 'Star' curators have often sometimes earnt themselves a bad name by allowing their vision - their identity - to dominate, forcing the work of exhibited artists into a background limbo. In this issue, Peter Murray performs an in-depth analysis of the curator of this year's ev+a, Hou Hanru. It seems Hou's identity - his origins and preferences - has impacted positively. It is sometimes said of society and politics in Ireland that we are more Boston than Berlin; it seems this year's ev+a has made Limerick a bit more Bladerunner than, well, Madagascar. What else? There's Andy Parson's project, which tricks with the individual and the sublime: more identity issues as Caspar David Friedrich's wanderer gains a hoodie. And there's more, lots more - enjoy! 23</page></plain_text>
